1 <br> The woman next to me said , It 's the Kamikaze . Someone else said , No , it 's the Painter  --  the Painter or the Fat Boy . <br> The river of people leaving the gates had log-jammed against a line of cops , and rumor rippled back through the crowd . A demon had possessed a man , and O'Hare security had sealed off the concourse between the gates and baggage claim . Reactions varied from exasperation to excitement . It was another travel delay , but at least it was an interesting delay . <br> I could see nothing beyond the end of the crowd but the cops ' blue shoulders and the cavernous space of the United terminal . We could n't go back : we 'd just come through security , and more travelers were filling in behind us . There was nothing to do but wait for the demon to finish its business . <br> I dropped my blue nylon duffel bag between my feet and sat astride it , surrounded by a forest of legs and luggage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , started up again . I stared at my shoes and tried to take clarifying breaths . My last doctor was big on clarifying breaths  --  that , and heavy meds . <br> I was tired . I 'd been traveling all day , flying standby and catching one flight for every three , portaging the duffel through three airports , three sets of security shakedowns . At least I was n't Japanese . Those poor bastards were practically strip-searched at every gate . <br> Someone backed into me , stumbled , and moved aside . I looked up , and the crowd shifted backward like spooked cattle . A path opened through the bodies , and suddenly I was alone in the middle of an aisle with the possessed man running toward me . <br> He was naked to the waist , his skinny chest and arms coated with gray dust , eyes wide and happy . He grinned , his mouth making words I could n't hear . I got out of his way , leaving my bag in the middle of the floor . <br> He veered suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his way ; people scattered . The crowd 's mood had lurched from morbid curiosity to outright fear . A demon five hundred yards away was a lot different than one in your face . <br> He grabbed the cart by its handles and tipped it easily with the cartoon strength of the possessed . Someone screamed . The glass case shattered . Yellow popcorn blossomed into the air , and a metal pan bounced off the tile and rolled away like a hubcap . <br> The possessed man cackled and began to scoop up the popcorn , ignoring the shards of glass . He rose into a squat , arms full , and winked at me conspiratorially . His hands were bloody . He staggered back the way he 'd come , hunched over his load . The cop let him pass without making a move . <br> What else could he do ? He could n't shoot the guy . It was n't his fault , and if they obstructed him the demon might get pissed , jump to someone else ( like a cop with a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but keep the gawkers back and wait for it to burn itself out . <br> I picked up my bag and walked forward  --  plenty of room at the front of the line now  --  until I 'd reached the temporary barrier , a ribbon of nylon strung between plastic posts . There was no one between me and the demon but a line of cops . <br> The United terminal was an art deco cathedral of steel and glass , shining ribs arcing under blue glass . I 'd always liked it . The demon , trailing puffs of popcorn , shuffled to the middle of the concourse , stopped between the Starbucks and the shrine to the Kamikaze , and opened his arms . The popcorn spread over the marble with a susurrant huff . <br> He surveyed the mess for a moment , and then began to dance . He crushed the popcorn beneath his glossy black shoes . He paused , then danced again . When he was satisfied he dropped to hands and knees and began pushing the yellow powder into the borders of his sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell it was . <br> What it was , though , was a farm : a quaint white farmhouse , a red silo and barn , a line of trees , wide open fields . The farmhouse was powdered detergent or sugar or salt ; the silo bits of red plastic and glass that could have been plucked from smashed exit signs ; the trees cunningly arranged candy wrappers and strips of Styrofoam from coffee cups and junk food packages . The crumbled popcorn became the edge of a wheat field . The picture was simultaneously naturalistic and hazily distorted , a landscape seen through waves of heat . <br> The demon began to add details . I sat down on my duffel and watched him work . He fiddled with the shards of red glass to suggest the warp of barn wood ; gently blew the white powder into the ghosts of gutters and window frames ; scraped his shoe heel against the marble to create a smudge above the house that could have been a cloud or a large bird . The longer he worked , the more familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before  --  at least , I did n't remember ever seeing a farm like this  --  but the picture was so relentlessly quaint , so Norman Rockwell , that maybe it was the idea of the farm that I recognized . The Jungians thought demons were archetypes from the collective unconscious . Perhaps the subject matter of archetypal artists was archetypes . <br> And then he abruptly stood and walked away , not even glancing back at the finished picture . The man took maybe a dozen steps , and then collapsed . No one moved for perhaps a minute . <br> Finally a cop edged forward , his hand on his nightstick , and asked the man questions I could n't catch . The man looked up , frightened . The cop helped him to his feet , and the man looked at his cut hands , then around at the crowds . The cop put an arm around his shoulder and led him away . <br> . . . <br> " Del ! " <br> Lew , My Very Bigger Brother , bellowing from the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mock embarrassment . This was part of their shtick : Lew was loud and embarrassing , Amra was socially appropriate . <br> Lew met me halfway across the floor and grabbed me in a hug , his gut hitting me like a basketball . He 'd always been bigger than me , but now he was six inches taller and a hundred pounds heavier . " Jesus Christ ! " he said . " What took you so long ? The board said your flight got in an hour ago . " His beard was bushier than when I 'd last seen him a year and a half ago , but it had still failed to colonize the barren patches between ear and chin . <br> " Sorry about that  --  something about four bags of heroin up my ass . Hey , Amra . " <br> " Hello , Del . " <br> I hugged her briefly . She smelled good as always . She 'd cut her long , shiny black hair into something short and professional . <br> Lew grabbed the strap from my shoulder and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <br> " Come on , you look like you have n't slept in a week . " He yanked it from me . " Shit , this is heavy . How many more bags do you got ? " <br> " That 's it . " <br> " What are you , a fuckin ' hobo ? Okay , we have to take a shuttle to the parking garage . Follow me . " He charged ahead with the duffel on his back . <br> " Did you hear there was a demon in the airport ? " Amra said . <br> " I was there . They would n't let us out of the terminal until he was gone . So what happened to the Cher hair ? " <br> " Oh . . . " She made a gesture like shooing a fly . " Too much . You saw it ? Which one was it  --  not the Kamikaze ? " The news tracked them by name , like hurricanes . Most people went their whole lives without seeing one in person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm lucky that way . <br> " The Painter , I think . At least , it was making a picture . " <br> Lew glanced back , gave Amra a look . He wanted her to stop talking about it . " Probably a faker , " Lew said . " There 's a possession conference going on downtown next week . The town 'll be full of posers . " <br> " I do n't think this guy was faking , " I said . That mad grin . That wink . " Afterward he was just crushed . Totally confused . " <br> " I wonder if he even knows how to draw , " Amra said . <br> The tram dropped us at a far parking lot , and then we shivered in the wind while Lew unlocked the car and loaded my duffel into the tiny trunk . <br> It was new , a bulbous silver Audi that looked futuristic and fast . I thought of my own car , crumpled like a beer can , and tried not to be jealous . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steering wheel , elbows out , like he was steering with his stomach . His seat was pushed all the way back , so I sat behind Amra . Lew flew down 294 , swearing at drivers and juking between lanes . I should have been used to Lew 's driving by then , but the speed and erratic turns had me gripping the back of Amra 's seat . I grew up in the suburbs , but every time I came back to Chicago I experienced traffic shock . We were forty minutes from downtown , and there were four crammed lanes on each side of the road , and everyone moving at 70 mph . It was worse than Denver . <br> " So what have you been doing with yourself ? " Lew asked . " You do n't call , you do n't write , you do n't send flowers . . . " <br> " We missed you at Christmas , " Amra said . <br> " See , Lew ? From Amra , that actually means she missed me at Christmas . From you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have let us down like that ? ' " <br> " Then she said it wrong . " <br> They 'd only been married for a year and a half , but they 'd been dating on and off  --  mostly on  --  since college . " So when are you guys going to settle down and make Mom some multiracial grandbabies ? The Cyclops has got ta be demanding a little baby action . " <br> Amra groaned . " Do you have to call her that ? And you 're changing the subject . " <br> " Yeah , " Lew said . " Back to your faults as a son and brother . What have you been up to ? " <br> " Well , that 's a funny story . " <br> Lew glanced at me in the rearview mirror . Amra turned in her seat to face me , frowning in concern . <br> " Jeez , guys . " I forced a smile . " Can you at least let me segue into this ? " <br> " What is it ? " Amra said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a car accident in November , went through a guardrail in the snow , and then  --  " <br> Lew snorted in surprise . " Were you drunk ? " <br> " Fuck you . The road was icy , and I just hit the curve too fast and lost control . I went through the rail , and then the car started flipping . " My gut tightened , remembering that jolt . My vision had gone dark as I struck the rail , and I 'd felt myself pitching forward , as if I were being sucked into a black well . " I ended up at the bottom of a ravine , upside down , and I could n't get my seatbelt undone . " I left out the caved-in roof , the icy water running through the car , my blind panic . " I just hung there until the cops got me out . " <br> " Were n't you hurt ? " Amra asked . <br> I shrugged . " My arms were scraped up , and my back was killing me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They kept me in the hospital for a day , and then they let me go . And afterward . . . well , all in all I was pretty lucky . " <br> " Lucky ? " Lew said . " Why do people say that ? You get a tumor , and if it turns out that you can operate on it , people say , gee , that was lucky . No , lucky is not getting cancer . Lucky is not getting cancer , then finding ten bucks in your shoe . " <br> " Are you done ? " Amra said . <br> " He totaled his car . He 's not that lucky . " <br> Amra shook her head . " You were about to say something else , Del . What happened after the accident ? " <br> " Yeah , afterward . " I suddenly regretted bringing it up . I 'd thought I could practice on Lew and Amra , get ready for the main event with Mom . Amra looked at me expectantly . <br> Continues ...   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
