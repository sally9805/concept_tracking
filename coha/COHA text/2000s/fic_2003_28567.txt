as he listened to his sister Gina give him last-minute instructions on how to handle the press today . She was the VP of PR , and in his opinion the one who should be escorting the contest winner - Holly Fitzgerald - around . But Gina and her husband , Flint , a noted spin doctor , thought it would be better if a top executive did the honors . And somehow he - the CFO - was the only one who could get up at five in the morning to handle this latest volley in Baronessa 's PR plan . " If anyone brings up the passion fruit gelato debacle , acknowledge that it was a mistake and one that Baronessa wo n't make again . Then use the fact sheet I gave you on the new flavor . " " Got it , " he said . Gina smiled at him . " Thanks for doing this . " " As if I had any choice . " Joe had tried arguing but it was hard to win with his mother or sisters . Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt and familial duty had won out . " Mom thought you 'd be the best one . " " Yeah , once you convinced her of it . You owe me , Gina . " She ignored his remark and consulted the schedule in her hand . " I 'm going to check and see if the contest winner is here yet . " Joe watched hissister walk away . Gina was tall compared to other women , but she 'd always be his little sister . She had changed in the last few months since her marriage to Flint Kingman . She now wore her curly light brown hair down instead of pinning it up . But then , finding the love of your life could do that to a person . She radiated a glow that only a woman in love had , and he was a little scared to see her so much in love with her new husband . He 'd changed after he 'd met Mary . And then changed again after she 'd died . But some things were better left in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a little after seven , he knew his entire day was shot . He resigned himself to working half the night to make sure the forecasts they 'd done for this new gelato flavor were correct . Baronessa needed a shot in the arm , and this contest , as harebrained as he 'd thought it was at first , might be the answer . He sat in one of the first-floor conference rooms in the five-story building that housed the executive offices , patiently having makeup put on for the television interviews he was doing this morning . He had an inkling of why neither his dad , the CEO , or brother Nicholas , the COO , had been unable to free their schedule today . But Baronessa was worth a few sacrifices and certainly worth the ribbing he 'd have to endure if any of his siblings wandered in while he was in the makeup chair . To distract himself , he glanced around the room . A sense of well-being assailed him as it always did when he realized he was a part of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international company . There was something about knowing exactly where you came from . And there was something about being surrounded by his family history every day that soothed his wounded heart . Most of the time . The gelateria had grown into more than an ice-cream shop founded in the forties by his grandparents Marco and Angelica and was now a Fortune 500 company . One Joe was proud to work for . He loved his job as CFO and had cut his teeth working for a large entertainment company in California before coming back to Boston and taking his place in the family business . " Here she is , " Gina said , entering the conference room with another woman . Joe 's breath caught in his chest . The woman walking toward him bore an uncanny resemblance to his deceased wife . Slim and petite , she had auburn hair that fell in waves around her shoulders . Mary 's hair had been shorter , he thought . But her features were similar . Heart-shaped face , full lips and a nose that curved the slightest bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his resilience . He 'd survived things that would have destroyed a lesser man . But he did n't want to tour the company 's headquarters with the doppelgnger of his deceased wife . Gina would just have to do it . " Holly Fitzgerald , this is my brother and Baronessa 's chief financial officer , Joseph Barone . " " Pleased to meet you , Ms. Fitzgerald , " Joe said , shaking her hand . Her hand in his felt soft , small , fragile . Damn . It had been a long time - five years to be exact - since he 'd held a hand that delicate . " Please call me Holly . " He nodded . He 'd survived by keeping himself aloof from women , by letting no one but family close to him , and he did n't intend to let this contest winner rock the secure moorings of his world . " Gina , can I speak to you privately for a minute ? " " Of course . Holly , why do n't you see our makeup artist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll be right back . " Joe did n't wait for his sister but walked out of the conference room . His brother-in-law was tall with chocolate brown hair and , according to his sisters , drop-dead gorgeous . " Where 's Holly ? " Flint asked as soon as Joe stepped into the hallway . " In makeup . " " Damn . How long do you think it 'll take ? " Flint asked . " I do n't know . Go check on her . " " I will . Joe , do n't go anywhere . The satellite uplink is ready and we have about ten minutes before the first interview . " ( Continues ... )
