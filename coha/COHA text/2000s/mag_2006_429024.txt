Q : Why do some sand castles stand firm until swallowed by the rising tide , while others fall over instantly ? A : Sand castles are ephemeral by nature  --  a good swift kick will destroy the sturdiest silicon-dioxide fortress in seconds  --  but scientists have learned that there are ways to maximize your creation 's strength . Clark University physicist Arshad Kudrolli recently published a paper in the journal Nature Physics on just this topic , entitled " Maximum Angle of Stability of a Wet Granular Pile . " A well-engineered sand edifice , Kudrolli says , must possess the ideal sand-to-water ratio . He and his colleagues , who had long studied the properties of granular materials , set out to find this ratio by mixing glass beads with various amounts of water . They placed a pile of each sample in a rotating Plexiglas drum and used a digital camera to record how far they were able to tilt the drum before the pile collapsed . The more extreme the tilt a mixture could survive , the higher the team rated it for structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic shovel might guess , the strongest piles turned out to be the ones made from relatively damp sand . The reason : Water forms so-called liquid bridges in the narrow channels between sand granules . The high surface tension of these tiny bridges makes individual grains adhere into durable clumps . In other words , Kudrolli explains , " The sand grainscome out sticky . They form a heap that 's more stable . " The effect has its limits , though . If too much water is added , the sand particles are " drowned " and no liquid bridges form . So what 's the ideal recipe ? " About 8 parts sand to 1 part water , " Kudrolli says . " Although our data indicate that anything from 6:1 to 20:1 sand-to-water would work . " Q : I hear that the guy who founded Space Adventures wrote a travel guide for space tourists . Is this a PR gimmick ? A : It depends what you mean by " PR gimmick . " Yes , Space Adventures CEO Eric Anderson has co-authored The Space Tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true cosmic travel agency  --  the company has already sent three private citizens for stays on the International Space Station via Soyuz spacecraft  --  Anderson is surely hoping to generate some buzz and perhaps drum up some business . But do n't dismiss his effort so casually . The book not only provides legit tips for the prospective space tourist  --  where to go ( a spin on the Vomit Comet ? suborbit ? the ISS ? ) ; what to see while you 're there ; how to prepare  --  it 's also a worthwhile source of Earthbound amusement , even if you 'll never be able to afford such a vacation . Advice includes " How to deal with fights on the Space Station " ( hint : do n't play chess with Russians ) , how to convince the preflight psychologists that you 're not a nutcase , how to use the toilet in zero G , and what to expect if your ride to space explodes on the launchpad . Even better are the instructions to those who might be observing the aborted launch from the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A normal launch will include copious amounts of smoke and flame . Be sure these flames are coming from the bottom of the rocket and aiming downward . If you see flames coming from the sides of the booster rocket , or notice flaming pieces of metal shearing away from the booster , be ready to take evasive action . " Indeed . Q : Is Aeon Flux the best I can hope for in science cinema this month ? A : Nope . Our favorite is the new Disney film ( tentatively titled Roving Mars ) about the Mars Exploration rovers , which landed in January 2004 and are still going strong . The documentary mixes insider views of scientists at work  --  performing wind-tunnel tests of the chutes that softened the rovers ' landing , for example  --  with close-ups of the Red Planet as seen through the rovers ' eyes . An animated take on our spacefaring future on Mars is a bonus . Enjoy it now , because the computer-generated film version is probably as close as we 'll get to a human space habitat for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if with all the talk of bird flu , Aeon Flux ( which came out on December 2 ) makes you a bit queasy . This sci-fi flick is set far in the future , after disease has wiped out 99 percent of the world 's population . People have begun disappearing from the last human city , and assassin Flux wants to find out why . We always like a good action film , but we 're more intrigued by the futuristic tech , such as a lawn that senses and pricks intruders . In 1949 geophysicist M. King Hubbert warned the world of dwindling oil reserves . Apparently , nobody listened . Although as economists today caution that we may already be reaching peak oil production , Syriana ( out December 9 ) seems eerily relevant . This thriller , based on the memoirs of CIA agent Robert Baer , explores the struggle to control petroleum resources , with a full complement of espionage , backstabbing and bribery . Q : I 'm getting worried about bird flu . Is there anything I can do about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a guy named John Davi . Not long ago , Davi , a 27-year-old California screenwriter , had the same question , and this dead-bird-emblazoned button is the result . Otherwise known as H5N1 , the bird virus is currently stalking Asia and , many fear , could spark a worldwide epidemic in 2006 . Davi came up with the pandemic-themed products  --  in addition to the buttons , there are T-shirts , mugs , hats , even infant onesies  --  as a laid-back way to spread awareness . " It comes across as pretty kooky to approach people and say , ' Hey , let 's talk about this bird flu that 's going to kill everybody , ' " he says , adding , " Not that wearing a T-shirt that says ' Ask me about bird flu ' is totally normal , but it 's not as confrontational . " The items ( which are available at h5n1wear.com ) bear such slogans as " Pandemic fever  --  catch it ! " The groupie-style " Bird Flu Tour " shirts list New York , Tokyo and other world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of an outbreak . Davi has been following bird flu in the news since he first read about it early last year . He found himself perturbed , not only about the threat but that so few people seemed to be aware of it . " It was the prospect of imminent death that got me , " he says . " If there was a huge meteor coming at the Earth , I 'd be concerned about that , too . " If you buy something , we suggest these talking points : + One strain of avian influenza in particular , H5N1 , is endemic in birds throughout Asia and has recently spread to Europe . + Because H5N1 is new , humans have no immunity ; more than half of those who have contracted it have died . + Person-to-person transmission of H5N1 is unconfirmed , but the virus mutates rapidly , increasing the potential for transmission between people . + If a fully contagious virus emerges , a pandemic is inevitable . Conservative estimates predict that 7.4 million people worldwide would die . Prices range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshirt .
