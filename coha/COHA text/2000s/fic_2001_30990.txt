Chapter 1 Mama and Tia got into a fight this morning . Mama found a package of red condoms in the back of Tia 's drawer . Mama was really pissed off . She held the condoms up and shouted at Tia so loud the dead folks at Peaceful Rest Cemetery down the street could hear her . " Tia , what are you doing with this mess ? " Mama asked , slamming the drawer of the rickety dresser . She pressed her face real close to Tia 's . You could barely see where Tia 's began and hers ended . Tia did n't say nothing . She just stood there in her blue-jeans miniskirt , with her slanted eyes blazing fire , and her hands on her hips . " Did you hear me , girl ? " Mama asked , looking like she was about to explode ; the little veins in her forehead had popped out so far they looked like huge earthworms underneath her coffee skin . " I 'm waiting , girl , " Mama said . " You tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to tell ! " Tia yelled . She brushed past Mama with her black ponytail whipping behind her back , stomped over to our bed , and flopped down in the middle of the sagging mattress . Then she folded her arms across her chest and glared at Mama like Mama had stolen her favorite tube of lipstick . Mama rushed over to the bed and pointed a finger at Tia 's face . " Did n't I tell you to come to me about this , Tia ? " Mama asked . " I always told you to come to me . You know damn well that we talked about this . " Tia rolled her eyes . " Let me tell you something , little girl ! " Mama yelled . " You just better keep your dress down and your drawers up . Do n't you be bringing home no babies for me to feed . Do you understand me , little girl ? " Tia crossed her legs and stared out of the windowover the bookshelf , like she was n't particularly interested in what Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to slap her , like she was going to knock her all the way back to the middle of June . And Mama could do it too . She was a big woman , strong and solid-built . She stocked groceries at Miller 's One-Stop weeknights . She could send Tia flying across the room with just one lick . But she did n't . She just shoved the condoms into the pocket of her blue terry robe , shook her head , and stormed out of our room , dropping pink curlers out of her slick black hair as she hurried through the doorway . After Mama left , Tia got up from the bed and ran into the bathroom . I heard her turn the rusty door lock and break into sobs , as if she had actually caught a whipping . I sat down in her place on the bed and listened to her cry . Guys had been sniffing around Tia since she was my age , twelve . Unlike me , she was sort of a looker . She was n't really pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips were just a little too thin for her broad nose . Her face was average , with only a touch here and there to give it a spark , and her cheekbones were just a little high . To be honest , it was really Tia 's body that kept the guys coming around . Below , everything fell into place with a lot extra on top . It was the " on top " that made the boys act all stupid and stuff . Grandma Augustine had always said that she did n't think Tia would last more than three winter seasons past her first period . She said that Tia would hear her womanhood calling her with a vengeance , and she would answer long before Mama was ready for her to stop wearing bows in her hair and lace dresses . She said that there was no way to keep it from happening , because Mama had done the same thing at her age . Mama had gotten pregnant with Tia when she was only fifteen . " Mistakes made in the dark always come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't sure if Grandma was right , but I was sure that Tia was hurting . I wanted to knock on the bathroom door and tell her that it was all right , but I could n't . I was a reader and a writer , but not much of a talker , at least when it came to feelings and stuff . I got up from the bed , pulled open the top dresser drawer , and took out my blue notebook and a pen . Everything 's a mess , I scrawled . Anger is covering our house like pitch on a rooftop , and I 'm gon na be late for school . After things finally died down at the house , I ate a quick breakfast of Froot Loops and ran three blocks to the bus stop . When I arrived , there was the new girl standing in the street next to the black-and-white bus sign . I had seen her once or twice from my bedroom window . She and her mother had moved next door to us a couple days ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was fat , and short in the places that I was long . She was lighter than me too , kinda butter-colored , like the shortbread cookies Mama cooked every Easter . Her hair was coarse like mine , but it was n't black . It was reddish tan , and in the early morning sunlight it looked almost blond . Her eyes were n't brown , either . They were olive . She wore a dingy white dress that had two deep clip marks on the shoulders , as if she had just yanked it off of the clothesline . There was n't any traffic on the narrow neighborhood street , but she was just standing there staring into the filthy rain gutter , staring into the blackness , as if she expected something to crawl out . I was curious , so I hopped off the curb and stared into the gutter too . " Whatcha looking at ? " I asked in a friendly voice . She just kept staring into the gutter , as if she did n't even know I was there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was windy out . A hot breeze was rustling through the tall pecan trees in the vacant lot behind the bus stop , and a Naughty By Nature tune was blaring from the open window of Perry 's 24-and-7 beer joint across the street . The small aluminum-sided building was vibrating from the beat . " Whatcha looking at ? " I asked , even friendlier than the first time . " My bracelet , " the girl said in a soft voice . " My bracelet , it slipped off and fell down there . " I leaned in closely and peered into the rectangular-shaped hole , but all I could make out in the darkness was a white plastic cup and some pages of a crumpled old newspaper . " I do n't see nothing , " I said . " It 's in there , " she said . " I got ta have it . We got ta get it out . " I was n't really sure who she meant by " we . " It was n't my bracelet that was down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw something moving around . It 's a rat , I told myself , a big , hairy rat with red eyes and yellow teeth . There were plenty of them in the Bottom  --  big , shaggy monsters that lived in the walls of our tiny rent shacks , underneath our porches , and , of course , in the rain gutters that lined our littered streets . " I ai n't sticking my hands down in there , girl . You must be crazy ! " I yelled . The girl did n't even look my way . She got down on all fours and shoved her thin hand into the drain . As she leaned into the hole her dress hiked up , exposing her underwear . Her yellow panties were shabby and ripped in several places . The elastic was loose and hanging halfway down her bony thighs . She was wearing worse than hand-me-downs . She was wearing worn-outs . " Let me get your bracelet , " I said . " My arms are longer than yours . " I got down on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the gutter and fished around in the trash until I felt something round . It had to be the bracelet . I pulled it out and stood up . It was plastic , transparent , and purple . You could buy a dozen like it for a buck in any dime store on Main in downtown Houston . I handed it to her with a scowl on my face . She snatched it and held it up to her breast , like it was a new dress or something . " Thanks , " she said , with a big grin . " I woulda been really upset if I could n't of got it . " " It 's just an old plastic bracelet , " I snapped . " You can buy ' em for nothing downtown . " " No ! You ca n't buy this anywhere . It 's a magic bracelet , " the girl said . " When I hold it up in the moonlight , I become so tiny that only the ants can see me . When the wind blows real hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful , beautiful place to land . " With that , the girl slipped the bracelet over her wrist and stepped up on the curb . " I got ta go . I 'm gon na be late for school , " she said , fingering the bracelet and starting to walk off quickly . " You go to my school , Martin Middle , do n't you ? " I asked . " Yeah , " she said . " But my mama did n't give me money to ride the bus . " " I 'm Shayla . What 's your name ? " I called after her . " Kambia , " her voice trailed . " I 'm Kambia . " I stood there in the street and watched her skinny body stepping lightly over the dirty sidewalks . There was something that bothered me about that girl and her silly magic bracelet . I just could n't imagine anybody showing underwear like that for a ten-cent toy . It was way too weird . She was way too weird . I stepped up on the curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks there had been nothing but rain , buckets of it pouring out of the gray sky , overflowing our gutters , and flooding our streets . But last night the rain stopped , and this morning the sun was shining bright over our houses , reclaiming its place among the clouds . It looked like it was gon na be a nice day . That is , until Mama got a visit from Miss Earlene Jackson . Miss Earlene lives in a large two-story shack a few blocks up the street . She is a mean-spirited , sour-faced woman with pop eyes and a huge belly that hangs over her thin legs like an oversized water balloon . The children in the neighborhood call her Frog . Frog came raging up our porch steps around noon . She had a look that would have turned the devil into a Christian , and she was throwing hell all over the place with each step . Mama stopped sweeping the living-room floor . She opened the screen door and stepped outside with her broom in her hand . I followed her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can I help you , Miss Earlene ? " Mama asked , tugging the front of her flowered dress with her free hand . Mama had been doing housework all morning , and her dress was drenched with sweat and clinging to her huge frame . " You sho can ! " Frog yelled , throwing bits of spit in all directions . " You can tell that fast-tail mare of yours to stay away from my Doo-witty ! " " Excuse me ? " Mama said . She opened her eyes real wide , like she did n't believe what Frog had said . " You heard me ! " Frog yelled . " You keep that little fast-tail mare of yours away from my Doo-witty ! " Mama 's eyes narrowed . " What fast-tail mare of mine is you talking about ? " she asked . Her voice was real calm and controlled , but you could see just a hint of red pushing up through the ebony of her cheekbones . " That little butt-wiggling , leg-spreading gal of yours , Tia , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You keep that little heifer from slipping ' round my house with my Doo-witty . " " With Doo-witty ? With Doo-witty ? With Doo-witty ? " Mama repeated over and over , like she was in some kind of trance . Tia with Doo-witty , the thought of it made you want to throw up . Doo-witty , whose real name was Donald Dwight , was Frog 's only son . He was twenty-three . He was a slow , drop-jawed , long-headed dope . When the boys in the neighborhood played The Dozens , they always said that he was so stupid that he was once fired from the M &M's; factory for throwing away all the Ws . Tia with Doo-witty , it was n't possible . Tia was fine , and she made great grades in school , like me . She could choose . " Tia fooling with Doo-witty , " Mama said . " What would my Tia want with Doo-witty ? Doo-witty so stupid he had to repeat the eighth grade three times . He would n't even know when his own birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would my baby be doing messing ' round with that thing ? " " Well , how do you explain this ? " Frog yelled . She pulled a lacy beige bra out of her pocket and shook it in Mama 's face . Mama 's jaw nearly fell onto the front porch . On the right cup of the bra , embroidered in gold floss , were the letters T. M. Mama had been sewing our initials on our underwear ever since Tia started middle school . In gym it was common for other girls to swipe your undies . Hard times made some kids do the craziest things . I leaned against the porch column and shook my head . " I guess you can believe your own eyes , cai n't you ? " Frog said with a smirk on her bloated face . " Ai n't you gal named Tia Marie ? " Mama did n't answer . She just kept staring at the right cup of Tia 's bra , like it was gon na do a dance or something . " Now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep that slut of a gal of yours away from my Doo-witty . I got plans for Doo-witty . It ai n't too late for him . I been putting a little aside each week . Pretty soon I 'm gone have enough to send Doo-witty to a decent college . I do n't want no little gal throwing her legs over her head and messing up his chances . " Mama took a deep breath and let it out . Her eyes snapped away from Tia 's bra and fixed on Frog . They were now just little slits in her face , and right in the middle of those slits you could see Mr. Anger jumping up and down in his red anger suit . Mama 's hands started to tremble , then that tremble traveled on up her arms until her whole body was shaking . " Ai n't no college in they right mind gone let in Doo-witty , " Mama said through clenched teeth . " And even if they did , the only thing that he could major in is Fool , and he already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointed the handle at Frog . " Now , I ai n't no fighting woman , " Mama said . " But if you do n't get yo ' frog-looking behind off my porch , I truly believe that I can make an exception in your case . You got two seconds to get outta my face , or I 'm gone swat your fat ass with this broom , like you was a fly at a church picnic . " Frog got off our porch  --  and fast . She ran down the steps and rushed out of the wooden gate . She hit the pavement and sprinted off down the street with that big double-size belly jiggling left and right over her skinny legs . Mama ran down to the gate behind her . " If I catch you or Doo-witty ' round my baby , I 'm gone see what the law got to say about it ! " Mama yelled . " Do you hear me ? I better not catch you or that sorry-ass Doo-witty ' round my Tia . " She watched from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars lined up in front of the red-brick project down the street ; after that she came back up on the porch and swept Tia 's bra into the pink rose bushes that were still growing wild on the side of the porch . Mama sat down in the old wicker rocker beside the screen door and sighed . Her eyes looked heavy , like they were ready to drop tears . But Mama did n't cry . She always said that even from a little girl , she could n't make water come to her eyes . So she just sat there rocking in the chair while she turned on the shower in her soul and let her tears run all over her insides . I walked over and took one of her hands in mine . While I ran my fingers over her rough skin , I made a note in my head to jot down in my blue notebook later : Mama is all broken inside , and sorrow is hanging from our ceiling like icicles from Christmas trees . After a few moments Mama got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . I knew what she was going to do . She was going to go into the kitchen and fix herself a pan of hot-water corn bread . Mama always fixed the bread when she was upset . She said that there was something about the sound of the cornmeal patties sizzling in the hot grease that calmed her nerves . She said that it was soothing , like listening to the blues or jazz . I decided to leave Mama to her comfort . Besides , I knew that after Mama 's nerves calmed a bit she was going to go find Tia and drag her home . Tia was at her best friend Maxi 's house . Maxi was a short , dumpy , chatty girl who lived on Divine Street , three blocks away from Frog . Tia went to Maxi 's house every Saturday morning to watch rap videos on the black cable channel . Mama was going to go snatch Tia away from Maxi 's house as soon as she had eaten the last crumb of her bread . It was n't gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ' em now , fussing and arguing down the street , putting on a real show . That was the way it always was with Mama and Tia . They were like lemonade and hot chocolate . They were good by themselves , but when you put them together all you got was one big mess . This was one fight I figured I could miss . I did n't want any of those sparks that were gon na be flying off of Mama to burn me up along with Tia . I hopped down from the porch . " Mama , I 'm going down the street a bit , " I hollered as I strolled up the walkway . " Do n't go too far , " Mama hollered back through the screen door . I went through the gate and banged it shut behind me . The neighborhood was in heat shock . It was almost ninety-eight degrees . Here and there a fuzzy-haired kid could be seen throwing a plastic ball against the concrete porch steps , or drawing his name on the sidewalk with buckets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities going on in front of the rows of paintless , run-down houses . Most people were inside sitting next to their window fans . As I passed by the open windows I could see tips of dark heads flashing between the twirling blades , and hear the soft whisper of voices floating over the whir of the fan motors . When it was this hot , it was common for most of the adults to stay inside until the cooler hours of the evening , with two exceptions : Perry 's 24-and-7 was hopping as usual . The stereo was blasting a Marvin Gaye tune , and groups of stylishly dressed , sweaty brothers and sisters were standing in the open double doors gossiping , their dark brown hands wrapped around open cans of Coors beer . The other group of people out in mass were the women of the Tabernacle of the Blessed Redeemer . On the third Saturday of each month the women put their men out of the church and held a women-only cleansing revival . Arm in arm they filed by twos into the one-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarves , their smooth black legs sticking out from underneath their knee-length ivory robes . Once inside the church , the ladies would sing spirituals until they felt the spirit hit them . Then they would hop up and dance down the aisles , shaking tambourines and chanting . When this was over , they would hear a sermon on the role of women in and out of the church by their leader , Sister Ashada , the tabernacle 's female soul-saving minister . Finally , they would take part in the sprinkling ceremony , where they were sprinkled with sand from Jesus ' footprints that was supposed to take away all their sins . Mama had taken me and Tia there for a service once . It was right after my daddy , Mr. Anderson Fox , took off on her and moved in with another woman . Mama had just been laid off from her job at Walgreens . The bills were stacking up and the food was low . Mama said that we needed the hand of God to help us quick . Even though she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleansing revivals . She said that Grandma Augustine always told her that God liked a clean soul . When the spirit hit , Mama got up and danced in the aisles like the rest of the ladies , but Tia and I just sat there . The whole thing seemed really odd to me , and I wanted no part of it . I was n't too big on church , and I had n't yet made up my mind about how I felt about Grandma Augustine 's God . But Tia really liked the revival and the friendly way that the ladies treated us and one another . She said that she would have gladly got up and danced too , if she had n't had a runner in her panty hose . Tia is very particular about her looks . It generally takes her more than an hour each morning to fix her face for school . Since I did n't see any kids my age hanging out in front of the houses , I decided to head on down to the bayou , just a little ways from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teenagers in my neighborhood . When there was nothing better to do , you could always find a few of them chillin ' and knocking back a few sodas along the bank or listening to some tapes . That sounded great to me . Any place was better than home , at least for now . The roar of the bayou hit me as I stepped through a prickly cluster of blackberry shrubs that guarded the entrance to the dirt path running along both sides of the bayou . The runoff from our streets had drained into the murky green waters , and they were much higher than normal . The current was moving swiftly , rippling and churning as it pushed forward downstream , splashing against the tall weeds growing on the side of the black dirt cliffs . I walked over to the edge of the cliff , took a deep breath , and let it out . The bayou was the place where the people in the neighborhood dumped all the old stuff from their houses that they did n't want : broken furniture , old clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was filled with little chunks of other people 's lives , the parts of their lives that they wanted to forget . I leaned in and listened to the water carry those chunks away . It was peaceful , calming . The bayou was to me like hot-water corn bread was to Mama . When I was through enjoying the sound of the water , I turned back and continued on up the path . It was nice and cool as I strolled underneath the tall trees that lined the right side of the path , their spacious branches stretching toward the warm blue sky like huge upside-down feather dusters . It was turning fall , and the pecan trees were loaded down with hard green pecans , while the spindly branches of the pine trees were thick with large , scaly cones . The once muddy ground had already started to dry up , etching deep lines into patches of the smooth gray soil , and I took my sandals off so that I could feel the tiny cracks with my bare feet . I was a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , lying in the middle of it . I did n't have to get too close to know that it was Kambia . She was lying in the center of the path on her back with her legs together and her arms straight at her sides . I could see that she was wearing the same dingy dress . In fact , I had seen Kambia in that dress at least a half a dozen times . Kambia and I had the same fourth-period biology class at school , that is , when she came to school . Since she moved here Kambia had missed more than half of the classes . She hardly ever showed up . When she did come , she said the craziest things , and the other children laughed at her . When Mrs. Feely , our teacher , asked Kambia where babies come from , Kambia said that they were born in morning glories . She said that they dropped out of the violet , dew-drenched flowers early in the morning when everyone was asleep and crawled to the homes of their new mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning glories before their time , and that they turned into a sweet-smelling mist and rose high up into the heavens . When it rained , it was God sprinkling the bodies of those babies all over the earth . The other kids all thought that it was the funniest thing they had ever heard . They laughed long and loud , until Mrs. Feely slammed her bio book down on the counter and told Kambia to go stand outside where she could n't disrupt the rest of the class . Kambia did n't seem to mind at all . She just got up and calmly walked out . After Kambia was gone , Mrs. Feely told us that she had never heard such foolishness in her life . She told us that we were there to learn science , not fantasize , and that there was no place for clowns in her room . I hurried over to Kambia . To tell the truth , I was more curious than concerned . Mama had made me go over to her house a couple of times and knock on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she always came to the door and said no . Kambia 's mom did n't let her come out on Saturdays or even after school . Her mother , a tall , light-skinned woman with red eyes and heavy ankles , did n't allow Kambia out much , unless she was sending her to the corner store for cigarettes or wine coolers . Allen 's Pick-and-Carry would sell anything to anybody , no matter how young , as long as they had the cash . I walked up to Kambia and stopped by her head . " Are you all right ? " I asked , looking down at her face . Her eyes were closed , but I could see the soft flutter of her eyeballs underneath the lids , as if she were dreaming . " Are you all right ? " I repeated . She did n't respond . I started to panic . I bent down and tugged her arm . " Hey , are you okay ? " I asked again . She opened her eyes and looked at me with a dreamy expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 've just floated down from the Mississippi River and washed up here on the bank . " " You 're a space cadet , " I said , and dropped her arm . " No . I 'm an old , hollow piece of driftwood who has lived its time and come here to rot . I 'll turn into rich fertilizer and nourish the earth , then years from now people will grow flowers or vege-tables in me and I 'll be reborn and made fresh . " " You 're a crazo , " I said . " I do n't have time for baby games . I 'm gon na go find some other kids to do something with . Besides , if you were a piece of driftwood , you would be in the water . That 's what driftwood means , a piece of wood drifting on the water . " " I am a piece of driftwood , " she whined , in a voice that sounded like my three-year-old cousin , Lisa . " You 're too babyish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I tell you I am a piece of driftwood , " she repeated . " I just floated down from the Mississippi and washed up here on the bank , " she said , pushing her small pink lips into a pout . " There 's no way a piece of driftwood could make it all the way here from Mississippi , " I said . " I 'm going . " I started back up the path , but she grabbed my ankle . She scrambled to her feet and ran over to the edge of the water . " I 'll show you , " she said , sitting down on the bank and throwing her skinny legs over the side . " I am a piece of driftwood . Watch how I float on top of the water . " I ran over to her . " Are you crazy or something , girl ? " I asked . " That water is really deep . You ca n't float on it . You 'll drown .

" I turned around and walked a piece from the cliff , thinking that she would follow me , but she did n't . She started humming loud , a nursery rhyme , " Three Blind Mice . " I turned around . She took off her other sandal and flung it in the direction of the first one . She started sliding on her butt through the thick weeds toward the water , moving up and down with her knees , like an inchworm or something . " You 're gon na drown , " I said . " The water is too fast . You ca n't swim in it . " She just kept sliding , sliding and humming , sliding and humming . I did n't know what to do . I ran over and tried to grab her arm , but she was outta my reach . I looked downstream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a group of boys in cut-off jeans dragging on cigarettes and throwing rocks in the water . I thought about running and getting them , but by the time I got down there Kambia would be in that bayou , for sure . What in the world was wrong with her ? She had to be a slice short of a full pound cake . I leaned in over the cliff . " Kambia ! " I yelled . " This is n't funny . You can get really hurt . Stop being so stupid . " She did n't even turn around . The water was splashing something fierce against the base of the cliff . She just kept sliding and humming . Should I go down after her ? I could n't really swim . All I could do was dog-paddle , which was usually okay when the bayou water was calm . Everybody knew not to get into the water after a rainstorm . Even the youngest kids in the neighborhood knew that the water was really dangerous after we had had a flash flood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the water . Some of it had splashed up on her white dress , and the tail of it was covered with little pieces of black leaves and twigs . " I believe you ! " I shouted . " You are a piece of driftwood ! " " And where did I come from ? " she shouted back , over the roar of the water . " You just washed up here from the Mississippi ! " I yelled . " Where you 'll rot and nourish the earth ! " " Fine , " she said . She started to inch her way back up the cliff the same way that she had got down , scooting that bony butt of hers backward instead of forward , grasping hunks of weeds to help pull herself up . When she finally reached the top , I grabbed her arm and tugged her up . " I told you , " she said . " Now do you believe me ? " she asked with a satisfied look in her olive eyes . I wanted to wring her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick or something , but I just cut her a look that woulda stopped a charging dog and marched back over to the path . " You make me sick , " I said .

" I just wanted you to play with me . " " I do n't like the way you play , " I snapped . She tugged my arm . " If you let me hang out with you , I 'll tell you my deepest secret , " she said . I stopped . " What is it ? " I asked . " Wait , " she said . " I got ta get my shoes .

But she had , at least , kept her promise to me and told me her secret , though I was n't sure if it was really a secret or just something that her mother had told her not to tell . According to Kambia , she and her mother had moved to Houston from Dallas because some woman was after her mother . She said that her mother was stepping out with some guy who owned a fish shack , and his wife found out about it and told her mother that she would slice her up like a sweet potato pie if she caught her on the streets , so Kambia and her mom caught a Greyhound to Houston . Kambia 's secret was a little bit believable . Her mother had lots of boyfriends . Tall dudes , short dudes , bearded dudes , there was always some guy coming outta her house , especially at night . I was n't sure where her mom had found a job , but wherever it was , she sure did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only other thing that I learned about her was that she was a reader , like me .

The house is filled with trapdoors , secret passageways , and stuff like that . In the book Linda James spends the entire summer exploring all of the magical new things that the house has to offer . " I wish I could do that , " Kambia said as we headed up her walkway . " I wish that I could do nothing but explore all day and all night . I would find all the wonderful things that the world had to hide , then I would take them , put them in an empty mayonnaise jar , and look at them every morning when I woke up , " she said , twirling down the brick walkway like a leaf caught in a whirlwind .

" " Okay , I 'll ask my mama tonight , " the voice said . I continued on down the walkway . As I stepped onto the sidewalk I heard the creak of the screen door , then a loud , shrill voice that I knew from experience was her mother 's . " Kambia Elaine .

Her eyes were puffy and swollen and her nose was red . She was licking her wounds . Tia 's way of doing this was braiding her hair . She was sitting in her plaid short shorts and her demi-top , separating long strands of it with a plastic comb and weaving it into thin twists . I walked up the steps and slid in behind her . Taking the comb , I started to braid her hair in the opposite direction , over where she had gone under . " What 's up , Tia the Chia Pet ? " I asked . " Where you been , Shayla ? " she asked . " As far away from you and Mama as I could get , " I said . " Mama is seriously trippin ' , " Tia said . " What am I gon na do ? Mama treats me like I ai n't more than two years outta my diapers . She always going on at me about stuff everybody else is doing . Why cai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? " " I do n't know , Tia Chia , " I said , " but if I was you , the next time I went somewhere I was n't suppose to be , I would make sure that I brought home everything that I took with me . " " I know , " Tia said , turning in the direction of the rose bushes . Her bra was still there , blanketing the soft petals . I guess neither she nor Mama was brave enough to claim it . " I really messed up this time , " she said . " I really messed up . " " Messed up " was an understatement of what Tia had done . Mama loved hard , but she did n't forget easy . Tia had drilled a hole in Mama 's heart and all Mama 's trust of her had run out of it . It was gon na be a long time before Mama forgot what she done . " Stuff everybody else is doing , " Tia had said . I could n't imagine anybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kambia said she and her mom had moved from Dallas , I figured Tia was n't the only one getting herself into trouble over some worthless guy . I decided that I was gon na leave guys alone until I was about forty . Poor Tia . I stopped combing her hair , put my arms around her neck , and gave her a big hug . I wanted her to tell me what was going on with her and Doo-witty , but I did n't know the words to make her feelings flow . I also wanted to tell her about the stunt that Kambia had pulled , tell her that I thought that Kambia was really spaced-out , and that she mighta jumped into that bayou for sure , but nothing came out of my mouth . So I just made another note to add to my blue notebook later , when the house had cooled off : Tia 's nature is boiling out of her like hot soup out of a pot , and Kambia Elaine just flew in from Neptune .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
