The one thing you should know about me is this : I 'm the consummate Good Girl . I wash my makeup off every night , no matter how tired I am . I mail out my Christmas cards every Thanksgiving weekend without fail , and thank-you notes are written and posted within three days of receipt of any gift . I 've only called into work sick once when it was n't really true , and even then I spent the entire day too racked with guilt to enjoy it . I 'm an extremely loyal and dependable friend , and have never cheated on a boyfriend or tried to steal a man away from another woman . And I never , ever say yes when a friend asks me if she looks fat , particularly if in the throes of a heartbreak she 's been hitting the Hagen-Dazs pretty hard , because girlfriends should stick together and not make each other feel self-conscious about their weight . But the problem with being a Good Girl is thisI 'm terrible at conflict . Absolutely hate it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When it comes to the fight-or-flight phenomenon , my fight is nonexistent , as wimpy as Popeye pre-spinach . Luckily , I am a world-class sprinter when it comes to running away from everything having to do with anything that even remotely resembles strife . Which is why , as I sat in the wood-paneled bar of McCormick &; Schmick 's on K Street nursing a glass of merlot , I was dreading the arrival of my soon-to-be ex-boyfriend , Eric Leahy . After weeks of dodging his phone calls , I was resolved to finally end the relationship . And unlike every other breakup I had ever muddled with my pathetic timidity , this time I had a plan : I would tell Eric gently , but firmly , that it was over , and at all costspreserve our dignity . I was a career woman , an attorney ( a career you mightas my friends dofind amusing for me to have stumbled into , considering my above-mentioned aversion to conflict ) , and there was no reason why I could n't end this relationship gracefully . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , nor would I allow myself to be guilted into giving it a second chance or entering into couples counseling . I had let this relationship drag on for far too long , and just like with a Band-Aid , it 's better to rip it off all at once . Of course , as I sat there , hunched up on a hard wooden chair that was putting my butt to sleep , while dipping pieces of pita into a pot of lemony hummus , I did n't feel cool or dignified ; I felt sick to my stomach . I 'd come to the bar directly from the office , and I had that end-of-the-workday feelgrimy and sweaty , my feet tired from walking the five blocks to the bar from my office in my three-inch stacked loafers , the waistband of my favorite black pantsuit digging into my skin . It was August , and far too hot to be wearing a suit , even one made out of lightweight wool crepe that was supposed to be " seasonless , " but which felt as heavy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to perk up the otherwise dull , buttoned-up look with a hot-pink shell which I had thought looked great that morning , but as soon as I got to my office I dribbled some iced mochacchino on it , leaving brown spots splattered all over my top , and was forced to button my jacket up over the stain . I had n't sweltered in my office , which was kept year-round at just above freezing , but as soon as I ventured back out into the damp heat of Washington , D.C. , in August , I began to melt . My foundation dripped from my face , my mascara was smeared around my eyes , and my wavy hair , normally beaten into submission with a vast battery of anti-frizz products , had rebelled , and began wisping up into a Brillo-pad mess . I did n't feel elegant and composed ; I was sticky and weary , and dreading what was sure to be an unavoidably messy scene . Eric arrived . I caught sight of his affable , smiling face as he waved at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-work crowd of yuppies gathered in the bar . He collapsed in the empty chair I 'd been fighting to keep for him , and kissed me on the cheek . " Ellie , " he said . " You look beautiful . " Considering how grubby I both looked and felt , I knew he was lying . But as far as lies go , it was a sweet one . And Eric was always saying things like thatheaping compliments on me , telling me how wonderful he thought I was . It was a very appealing trait in a man , one that had kept me from breaking up with him before . It was n't that Eric was unattractivehe had glossy black hair , ruddy cheeks , and bright blue eyes , and looked sort of like a pudgy J.Crew model . And while he was a little chunky , and dressed in stodgy three-piece suits and shirts with cufflinks ( both of which looked pretentious on a thirty-two-year-old man ) , he was gentle and thoughtful . Not funny exactlywell , no , not funny at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were always the kind that had obvious punch lines , and he usually mangled the telling of the joke so badly you could n't even laugh at the sheer silliness of it . But he was a good man . A kind man . Exactly the kind of boyfriend the Good Girl aspires to , and nearly identical in appearance and personality to my last four boyfriends . We even had cutsie , matching namesEllie and Eric , E &; E. But , just like my previous four boyfriendsAlec , Peter , Winston , and JeremyEric bored me to tears . All he wanted to talk about was his jobsomething having to do with international finance ( although I still was n't exactly sure what , even though he 'd explained it to me more times than I cared to recount ) or whatever football/basketball/ baseball/cricket game ESPN had broadcast the night before . I 'm not one of those women who pretend to like sports in order to snag a guy ; in fact , I 'm pretty up-front about how I could n't care less about grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ball tucked under one arm . But despite explaining my lack of interest to Eric pretty much every time he started a conversation with " You would n't believe what happened in the game last night , " he persisted in boring me to tears with a play-by-play analysis . Spending dinner with him was pleasant as long as I could coax him into talking about something else , and the sex was tolerable , if not predictable . But just the idea of something more permanent , of lying beside him in bed every night and waking up to his face every morning , made me feel like I was being buried alive . And besides , Eric just did n't smell right . It was n't that he had b.o. , or that funky ripe odor some men get when they 're sweaty . He was very clean and deodorized , but there was something about the way he smelled when I wrapped my arms around him and breathed in deeply that was just . . . off . And his colognePolo , just as Winston and Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had spent a semester studying in Paris , wore Herms ) which he practically showered in , was overpowering and artificial smelling . Surely the man I was meant to spend my life with would smell sexy and good and safe , and not like a cheesy club promoter . " I 'm so glad you called , " Eric said , after ordering a martini . Why is everyone in my generation always ordering martinis ? Is it a desperate attempt to try to return the world to the days before the Boomers came along and wrecked everything with their self-indulgent Me Generation crap ? As though a single cocktail can undo the sixties , I thought , forgetting about the impending breakup just long enough to get annoyed by Eric , who had a tendency to be pompous , and then promptly feeling a flood of guilt when I remembered what I was there to do . " I 've been wanting to talk to you about something , " he said , stirring his drink , and spearing the olive on a toothpick . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of the way I 've been actingducking his phone calls , avoiding sex , snapping at him when he launches into one of his insufferably long diatribes about the yenand wants to dump me . It will make this so much easier . He 'll try to let me down easy , and I 'll try to look a little stricken , but say of course , I understand , I 've been so caught up at work ( ha ha ! ) that I have n't devoted enough time to the relationship . A dignified , understanding split , and I 'd be mercifully spared from having to do it myself . " Oh ? " I said , and smiled at him encouragingly . " I 've been wanting to talk to you , too . " " Okay . What about ? " " No , you go first . " " Well . . . " Eric said , and then ducked his head shyly , a nervous smile playing on his thin lips . " I want you to move in with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not breaking up . As in living together . I thought I was going to be sick . No , no , no , this ca n't be happening , I thought . This is the part where he 's supposed to say something like " I never meant to hurt you , " or " We 've been growing apart for a long time . " Ericobviously misreading my hesitationsaid , " I do n't mean without other plans . We could get engaged first . Maybe over Labor Day weekend we could take the train to Manhattan , go ring shopping , maybe see The Lion King " and then , seeing my stricken face , " What is it ? What 's wrong ? " " It 's just . . . um . . . is the air conditioner working in here ? " I asked . The bar had become so hot and stuffy I could barely breathe , much less think clearly . Eric 's words " engagement , " " plans , " " move in together " were jumbling around my brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to a collegial breakup , and now all of a sudden he wanted to live together forever , buy a house in the suburbs and have babies and minivans . What was it with men , anyway ? Why is it that when the woman wants a commitment , they panic and flee the jurisdiction , but grow a little distant and suddenly they 're out shopping for diamond solitaires and monogrammed guest towels ? " What were you going to say ? " he asked . " God , it 's hot in here . Do you think it 's hot in here ? I 'm burning up , " I blathered , and chugged a glass of ice water . " No , it feels fine to me . Are you okay ? " " Oh . Yes , yes . Just hot , " I said gaily , shrugging off my jacket , no longer caring about the stain on my top . Eric had a strange look on his face . " What were you going to say ? " he asked again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we should move in together , " I said weakly.
