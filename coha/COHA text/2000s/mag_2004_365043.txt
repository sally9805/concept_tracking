At 7:15 on the morning of June 17 , 1933 , seven men  --  local cops and federal agents  --  were loading a bank robber named Frank Nash into a car in Kansas City , Mo . Suddenly a voice barked , " Let ' em have it ! " and the group was engulfed by a storm of bullets . When the shooting stopped , somebody said , " Everyone 's dead in here . " <P> They were n't quite , but five of them were , including Nash . According to Bryan Burrough 's massively researched , ludicrously entertaining Public Enemies ( Penguin Press ; 592 pages ) , the Kansas City Massacre , as it came to be called , jump-started a national anticrime campaign that turned a governmental backwater called the Bureau of Investigations ( the Federal came later ) into the modern FBI . The killings also inaugurated a rollicking two-year carnival of bank robberies and kidnappings carried out by men like " Baby Face " Nelson and " Machine Gun " Kelly , men whose nicknames ring a bell but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <P> The challenge Burrough faces in writing about people like Nelson and Kelly is that they 've gone thin and stiff with age . " After decades spent in the washing machine of popular culture , " Burrough writes , " their stories have been bled of all reality . " Burrough strips the comic-book glamour off those cardboard villains and gives them back their grit and power to shock . We learn that Nelson was a tiny blond sociopath whose viciousness frightened even his pals . " Pretty Boy " Floyd  --  Charley to his friends  --  was a Dust Bowl farm boy . Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow come off as greedy , murderous children , not the doomed lovers of the movies . " Machine Gun " Kelly , despite his badass nickname , puked from nerves before his heists . <P> Bank robbing was n't an exact science in 1933 , and watching the bad guys figure it out as they go along makes for nonstop comedy . They flood their engines , shoot themselves , crash their cars and steal sacks of mail instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheelman had parallel parked the getaway car ; he had to make an Austin Powers  --  style multipoint turn before he could peel out . The G-men were n't much better . The FBI was staffed by bumbling college kids and led by a raccoon-eyed , sexually ambiguous desk jockey named J. Edgar Hoover , who at the time had never even made an arrest . But celebrity gangsters create a need for a national police force , and the FBI was the government 's answer . <P> Dillinger is the only one whose tremendous charisma survives Burrough 's research intact . Smart , good-natured and media savvy , he had a genius for improvisational humor . When a cop walked into a bank mid-robbery , Dillinger greeted him with a hearty " Come right in and join us ! " He was also as tough as nails . In one harrowing scene , he undergoes amateur plastic surgery to alter his appearance ( tragically , they filled in his dashing cleft chin ) . As for his colleagues  --  alas , the truth about " Pretty Boy " Floyd is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of fun . By Lev Grossman
