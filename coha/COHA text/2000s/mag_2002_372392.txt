Walking three days to raise money for breast-cancer research or cycling hundreds of miles for AIDS causes seems like the pinnacle of virtue . And the field of rigorous charity sports events is booming . So why are breast-cancer advocates circulating brochures that ask participants to " think twice before you walk " ? And why are AIDS charities embroiled in a nasty legal fight to break ties with one of their most successful fund-raising events , the lucrative California AIDSRide ? The charity endurance event  --  that unassailable , feel-good fund-raising strategy  --  is beginning to suffer a backlash , as participants and nonprofits question how hard-raised dollars are being spent . <P> Both the AIDS bike rides and the Avon Breast Cancer Walks , which together netted $69 million last year , are produced for charitable causes by a for-profit firm called Pallotta Teamworks . In the 1990s , Pallotta elevated the folksy fund-raising trend to a well-marketed mass movement with glossy brochures and inspirational videos . But that kind of approach is turning off do-gooders like Carol Peeples , 44 , a teacher in Salida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breast Cancer Walk last year . Peeples and other walkers received a coffee-table-book-size color catalog promoting various Pallotta causes , like a suicide-prevention walk in Washington ; they were required to watch a " safety video " that some described as a Pallotta infomercial ; and they saw Pallotta merchandise , like books by the company 's founder , all along the route . Cyclists on last year 's California AIDSRide , meanwhile , were upset that only 50% of funds they raised went to fighting AIDS , with some of it spent on a fireworks display that was virtually invisible under the midday Los Angeles sun . Pallotta argues that charitable causes deserve the same marketing muscle as for-profit companies and points to the hefty $223 million it has sent to charities in its nine-year history . But the rebellion in the ranks wo n't go away : the AIDS cyclists are planning their own ride , which , despite a legal protest from Pallotta , will take place in May . <P>  --  By Rebecca Winters              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
