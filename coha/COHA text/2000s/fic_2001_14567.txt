A filthy East Village apartment near Tompkins Square Park . A typical pre-war Skinner box . A naked window leading to a fire escape . A neon beer sign , turned off . A half-collapsed , stained , and bucket-seated sofa , duct tape over the cushions . A coffee table with three glass bowls of pills : a bowl of blue pills ; a bowl of pink pills ; a bowl of yellow pills . The bowls are nearly arranged , perfectly spaced . A random , street-plucked chair . An equally random ottoman . A full drum set , a microphone stand and mic next to the drum set . An electric and a bass guitar propped on guitar stands . A bass amp . A guitar amp . A keyboard set up on a stand , an amp next to it . A few microphone stands set up with mics . Some random cords and wires snaking indecipherably . Sweat socks , junk mail , crumpled beer cans , old set lists , pizza boxes , pools of things here and there . Drifts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hallway leading to unseen bedrooms . A front door . A small TV surveillance monitor housed in the wall next to the door . Underneath the monitor , someone has scrawled " MIKE " in black indelible ink . There are several shoulder-height holes in the wall . A kitchen sink choked with dirty dishes . A filthy table with scattered chairs . A trash can painted like R2D2 . CHASE and STAPLES , thirtyish , are sitting on the sofa , watching TV . They wear wrinkled thrift-store clothes . They are fully bearded and they smell . There is the feeling that the two of them have been living on the sofa since the previous spring . STAPLES sits very still . CHASE fidgets a bit , his feet never touching the floor Next to the chair , ANOTHER MAN lies on the floor . He is neither sleeping nor thinking . He is thirtyish , bearded , and lives in his underwear . The only source of light is the blue throb of the TV and a yellowish glow from the back of the apartment where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV should play throughout , but barely audible ; an animal being tortured . STAPLES I had this dream last night that I was a robot . Big metal robot . I was crying but nothing was coming out . I could feel the crying . In my throat . But no tears . And I did n't have any balls . Instead I had a light switch . I kept trying to turn it on but all it did was make this buzzing noise . CHASE puts his hand down his pants . p. 3 CHASE Wow . STAPLES I know , right ? They watch . CHASE You do the blues or the pinks ? STAPLES The blues . CHASE The pinks are good . You should n't do more than two . Never do more than two .

CHASE You wanted it . STAPLES I did , Chase , I did . I thought maybe they 'd yell at me . Stuff like ( as if invaded ) , Stand up straight ! Or , Look at me when I 'm talking to you ! CHASE Did they ? STAPLES Nu-uh. p. 7 CHASE What 'd they do ? STAPLES They put me in a room . There was this big mirror . A few metal chairs . This woman came in and gave me a glass of water . Then she put the tree up and left me alone with it . I think they were studying me on the other side of the mirror . CHASE Like studying studying ? STAPLES Uh-huh . CHASE What do you think they were studying ? STAPLES Probably my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They watch . CHASE Did the woman like do anything to the tree after she put it up ? STAPLES thinks .

They watch . STAPLES It was pretty weird . Lonely . CHASE Did like you do anything ? p. 8 STAPLES Um . Uh-uh . I felt like doing something , though . Like getting up and whirling my arms . Or just jumping up and down a few times . CHASE Did you get busted ? STAPLES Busted and disgusted . I called Frank the Father . He called his lawyers . They took care of it . CHASE Frank the Father 's a lawyer , too , is n't he ? STAPLES Lawyer . Banker . CFO . UFO . CHASE Unidentified Flying Financial Officer . STAPLES imitates a UFO flying through the air . He follows it with an invisible ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They both follow its descent to the earth and watch it crash . They laugh sadly . One of them farts like a French horn . CHASE Was that you or me ? STAPLES I think it was you . CHASE Oh . They watch . STAPLES I think about doing stuff but I get tired . Like more stealing . Canned fish . Little plastic things . Gum.Or breaking a window with my fist ! Wrapping it with the newspaper first and then punching ! Or kicking a garbage can ! CHASE starts to twitch uncontrollably . p. 9 STAPLES ( calm now ) Dude , you 're like twitching all over the place . CHASE twitches . STAPLES That 's so cool . I wish I could twitch Sometimes I 'll look at my hand . Like at a finger . And I 'll say to it , I 'll say , Move . And it will . CHASE Motor skills . STAPLES That 's how aliens must do stuff . I mean if they 're in a human body . Cause they do n't have the muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Hands and feet . Arms . They 'll say , Walk , legs . Like in their language . They 'll command themselves to do it . And they 'll just start walking places . So there 's more lag time with aliens . Cause they do n't have the memories . CHASE twitching punctuates into an explosive bicep muscle . CHASE Feel my muscle . STAPLES Feel your muscle ? CHASE Yeah . STAPLES Like feel feel it ? CHASE Sure . STAPLES No way , dude . CHASE Come on , Staples , covet my power source ! Feel the way my calories burn with whitehot fire ! p. 10 STAPLES That 's way too close , Chase ! CHASE Whitehot , blistering foxfire ! ! !

CHASE Like plants ? STAPLES Yeah , plants . Like in a greenhouse . How they do that thing to the Sun . Trap it or something . p. 11 CHASE Photosynthesis . The front door opens . LYNCH enters , closes the door . He is thirty , big , heavily bearded . He wears layers and layers of old sweats , batting gloves , a scarf , a dockworker 's skullcap , construction boots , a weight belt . He is exhausted , hunched , slow-moving . There is the sense that he has to search for every step . While crossing , he stops behind the sofa and is lured by the TV . He watches . Only the sound of the shrieking animal . After a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then kicks it in . The MAN ON THE FLOOR rises and crosses upstage . He takes his underwear down and begins urinating thoroughly into a broken tom-tom drum . LYNCH turns , stares at CHASE and STAPLES for a moment , and exits to the back of the apartment , closes a door . CHASE and STAPLES stare at the kicked-in TV , while the MAN ON THE FLOOR continues to urinate . STAPLES Chase ? CHASE Yeah , Staples ? STAPLES I do n't know what to like um do . CHASE Either do I. STAPLES turns to CHASE . STAPLES I 'm getting up ! p. 12 CHASE Yeah ? STAPLES Yeah , I 'm getting up ! He does n't move . CHASE Maybe count to three or something . STAPLES Good idea . CHASE I 'll count for you . STAPLES Okay . CHASE Ready ? STAPLES Yeah , I 'm ready . Go ' head . CHASE One . Two . Three . STAPLES rocks himself forward and off the sofa . He lurches slightly , rights himself , The MAN ON THE FLOOR finishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot near the chair , lies down . CHASE You okay ? STAPLES Yeah , yeah , I 'm good . STAPLES turns and crosses to the front door like some kind of lost and forlorn spaceman . He stares at the surveillance monitor and then lifts his arm and turns it on . It issues a vague , bluish-white screen , a few obscure lines . STAPLES attempts to wave the light from the monitor toward the TV , as if it will somehow cause it to work again . CHASE joins him and they wave with great fervor . They stop and watch the TV for a moment . p. 13 CHASE It 's not working . STAPLES Not really , right ? CHASE Nu-uh . STAPLES crosses back to the sofa , sits . STAPLES We could like watch Mike the Monitor . CHASE We could . STAPLES Maybe we should move the davenport . Make it easier to see . CHASE Good idea . They stare at each other a moment . STAPLES One . Two . Three . STAPLES rolls over his arm of the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually gets off the sofa and attempts to move it by using whatever force he can generate by charging and ramming into one of its arms . They surf-scoot-pivot the sofa so that it faces the surveillance monitor . CHASE sits back down , exhausted . They watch the monitor . CHASE It 's not bad . STAPLES Not too bad . CHASE I like how it 's kinda blank . STAPLES Yeah . The blankness . CHASE It 's like snow . STAPLES It is kinda . p. 14 CHASE Like a little box of snow . STAPLES A little box fulla snowballs . They watch . CHASE But it 's not the same ! STAPLES I know , right ? ! CHASE I keep expecting things ! STAPLES Yeah , Chase , me , too ! CHASE Like a little caribou to appear ! STAPLES I know , I know ! CHASE And the rhino ! ! STAPLES How those birds were just sitting on his back like someone put em there ! ! They stare at each other . CHASE One . Two . Three . STAPLES rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . Again , CHASE never actually touches the floor and uses the same charging-ramming method . After the sofa is re-positioned , they sit , exhausted . CHASE suddenly charges to STAPLES 's end of the sofa , violently pukes over the side , smothering STAPLES with his body . After a moment , he thaws from the hurling , wipes his mouth , returns to his side . CHASE Should I call Doug the Dad ? p. 15 STAPLES Call Doug the Dad . If it does n't work I 'll call Frank the Father . CHASE starts to burrow in the cracks of the sofa , searching for his cell phone . After a moment , he realizes that it is on the chair . STAPLES reaches into his pocket , lends him his cell phone . CHASE attempts to dial the number , but ca n't remember it . He hands the cell phone back to STAPLES and then lunges for the coffee table rather Olympically , and then , without ever touching the ground , manages to traverse the space between the sofa and the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ottoman , etc . It should be an enormous feat . He winds up securing his cell phone rather miraculously , sits on the ottoman , speed dials , waits . CHASE Hey , Daddy ? It 's Chase Hey Daddy , How 's it going ? How 's business ? Good , good What do I want ? Well , nothing , Daddy . Just calling to say Hey . Hey and how 's it going and how 's Mary the Mom and all that Oh , things are great .

A little northbound train action.Okay , Daddy Me , too Tell Mom I say Hey I know , I know Sure I 'll send that tape off . He turns the phone off , slips it back into his pocket . p. 16 CHASE Your turn , dude . Frank the Father . STAPLES dials his cell phone , waits . After a moment he starts to make pig sounds into the phone . Pigs , monkeys , and sheep . He stops , turns the phone off , puts it back in his pocket , looks at CHASE . CHASE Voicemail ? STAPLES nods . The sound of a door closing . Moments later , LYNCH appears from the back of the apartment . He is dressed in an enormous snowmobile suit . He steps slowly into the room as though he is n't sure where he is heading , stands very still . CHASE Alaska man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LYNCH it 's gettin cold . CHASE Yeah ? LYNCH Sposed to get in the teens tonight . STAPLES Whoa . CHASE Better turn the heat up . LYNCH Things are n't workin out so well . It 's better if there 's snow when that happens . CHASE and LYNCH stare at each other . An awkward pause . CHASE Where you goin , dude ? p. 17 LYNCH Get somethin for my toe . CHASE What 's wrong with your toe ? LYNCH It 's numb . CHASE Like numb numb ? LYNCH Uh-huh . STAPLES It 's prolly from the TV . LYNCH Meaning ? STAPLES Oh , nothing . It 's just that you like totally kicked it in and such . LYNCH Felt like the right thing to do . The perfect time , you know ? ( as if invaded ) IT 'S MONSTER MADNESS AT THE KIEL AUDITORIUM BIG TRUCKS BIG BIG TRUCKS TRUCKS SO BIG OTHER TRUCKS CAN RIDE AROUND INSIDE OF THEM ! ! ! The explosion sends LYNCH across the room , somewhere near the keyboard . He is oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , re-sets it on the stand . CHASE and STAPLES stare at each other . LYNCH crosses to the neon beer sign , turns it on , then touches the keyboard for a moment . LYNCH ( a reaching out ) I feel really far away from things . Like everything 's gettin smaller . Nobody moves . CHASE Um . How was like work , dude ? p. 18 LYNCH Okay . CHASE What kinda stuff you move ? LYNCH Sofas . Bookcases . Beds . Some statues . CHASE Like statue statues ? LYNCH Men , women . Men mostly . STAPLES Were they like nude ? LYNCH Yeah . STAPLES Any hot bods ? LYNCH reaches into one of his pockets and removes a marble breast . STAPLES Dude . CHASE Dude ! Gettin a little on the side ! LYNCH starts to slowly move the breast through the air , almost dancing with it . He hums a melodious tune . CHASE and STAPLES collaborate a bit . LYNCH blows into the breast as if it is a conch shell , making his way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face , his beard . What seems like fun starts to get a little scary as he uses the marble breast to force CHASE 's head into the cushion of the chair . LYNCH ( releasing CHASE 's head ) Ca n't have it ! CHASE Cool . p. 19 LYNCH ( to STAPLES ) You either ! STAPLES Hey , that 's totally cool . LYNCH puts the marble breast back in his pocket , crosses to the TV , sits on it . LYNCH I used to know a lot more stuff . ( to CHASE ) when we were in school , you know ? CHASE Sure . LYNCH Facts mostly . I was good with facts . CHASE Facts are good . STAPLES Yeah , dude . Facts are totally good . LYNCH Crosses to the window . LYNCH I 've been keeping a brick in my pocket . Left pocket . CHASE A brick and a tit . LYNCH Found it in the basement . CHASE The basement ?

A hundred million . CHASE Cool . LYNCH ( to STAPLES ) They 're just layin there like they 're sleepin . A hundred million robots . CHASE and STAPLES stare at each other . LYNCH turns , crosses to the MAN ON THE FLOOR . From his mouth he drops a slow gob of spit on him . The MAN ON THE FLOOR does n't stir . LYNCH watches him for a moment and then crosses to the front door . Before he exits , he removes a brick from his left pocket and smashes through the front of the surveillance monitor . LYNCH ( another reaching out ) Bye . CHASE Bye . STAPLES Bye , dude . LYNCH Washington was a good president . But Lincoln was better . You can tell cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . His footfalls can be heard descending the stairs . CHASE and STAPLES sit very still . p. 21 CHASE I have an idea . STAPLES Yeah ? CHASE Heldinwell . STAPLES Heldinwell ?

CHASE Sure . I 'll invite him up and while he 's under my narrative spell you can use the fire escape and bust into his apartment and snag his TV . STAPLES Good idea . CHASE I know , right ? STAPLES Sneaky . CHASE It 's totally sneaky . CHASE starts to make his way back to the sofa via the ottoman and coffee table route , as before . STAPLES So , um , can I like ask a question ? CHASE ( transitioning from ottoman to coffee table ) Sure . p. 22 STAPLES Why do you get to be the narrative spell guy ? CHASE Cause , dude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHASE Dude , I 'm such a good conversationalist . My words and images . My use of metaphor and freakish nouns . STAPLES Are you trying to say that I 'm like not good at images and freakish nouns ? CHASE No . STAPLES Cause I can totally paint pictures with words , Chase . You know I 'm so good at that . CHASE You are , you are . STAPLES I 'm like a metaphor factory . CHASE ( secure on the coffee table now ) That 's true , Staples . That 's totally true . But where you 're the factory I 'm like the quality control division . I make the metaphor a little more slippery . I add the salt and pepper . The spicy spices . I 'm like the quality control chef who takes on the metaphor as soon as it comes off the assembly line . STAPLES But , dude , I  --  CHASE Plus , you 're on the blues . I 'm on the pinks ! STAPLES I 'm such a good conversationalist , Chase . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHASE Why do you think I like hanging with you so much ? Besides , you 're the one who 's always getting locked out and coming in through the window . STAPLES What 's that supposed to mean ? CHASE Nothing . Just that you 're more familiar with the ways and means of the fire escape . It 's one of the things you 're really really good at . STAPLES Maybe . CHASE I 'll call him . CHASE leaps from the coffee table , lands on his side of the sofa rather impressively , pulls his cell phone out of his pocket , dials , waits . CHASE Yes . I 'd like the number of a Heldinwell on East Tenth Street in Manhattan Cool . ( he winks at STAPLES ) Hello . Is this Mister Heldinwell ? It is ? Oh , hey . This is Chase . Chase Fitzsimmons , your upstairs neighbor in apartment five Hey ! How 's it going ?

And the thing is , I 'm feeling a little fuzzed-out and insecure and both my roommates are away for the weekend . You see , I keep thinking someone 's behind me . It 's pretty bad STAPLES slowly turns around and checks behind the sofa . p. 24 CHASE Well , I know it sounds silly , but I was wondering if you would n't mind coming upstairs and entertaining me for a while . I keep wanting to turn around real fast but I know I 'm not supposed to cause of my discs and stuff . The lumber division of the spinal canal is quite neurologically and anatomically sensitive You would ? Cool , cool . I 'd really appreciate that Yeah , I just thought we could talk for a while . Shoot the breeze , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upstairs to downstairs . Man to man God , I so appreciate that It 's these pills , you know ? I think I took too many .

CHASE Sure , Staples . STAPLES What is it ? CHASE It 's Springfield , is n't it ? STAPLES stares off . CHASE You okay , buddy ? STAPLES I keep thinking about the caribou .

STAPLES I ca n't remember if he was a walrus or an Alaskan snow pony ! ! ! CHASE Um . I think he was a gorilla , Staples . STAPLES Yeah ? CHASE I 'm pretty sure about that one . STAPLES I was thinking about getting a job today . Doing something with my hands . Catching fish . Making things . Little wooden toys . p. 26 CHASE Toys are cool . STAPLES ( a little terrified ) I had this dream last night that I was a robot . Big metal robot  --  CHASE Yeah , you were crying  --  STAPLES I was crying but nothing was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no tears  --  CHASE And you did n't have any balls  --  STAPLES I did n't have any balls . Instead I had a light switch ! I kept trying to turn it on  --  CHASE But all it did was make this buzzing noise . STAPLES I was going to this graveyard . Where all the other robots were buried . And I found this flower . It was pink . A tulip , I think . I ate it . It made me feel better . CHASE Look , if all goes well , I bet we 'll get to see what happens to the caribou . STAPLES You think so ? CHASE I totally think so . STAPLES I 'd like that . CHASE Me , too , Staples . Me , too . You want me to count to three ? STAPLES Would you ? p. 27 CHASE Sure , buddy . He squares his body to STAPLES . CHASE One . Two . Three . STAPLES rocks forward and off the sofa , lurches a bit , rights himself , and then stares at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAPLES Maybe I should take a pink . CHASE ( standing on the sofa ) I do n't know , Staples ! Maybe another blue . Keep the colors together . STAPLES Right . STAPLES reaches down , grabs a blue pill , puts it in his mouth , swallows . Then he turns and crosses to the back of the apartment . CHASE stretches out on the sofa , his head opposite the front door . He puts a pillow under his knees , affects the posture of a back injury victim . Moments later , STAPLES appears wearing a snowmobile suit , similar to LYNCH 's , but a different color . He crosses to the stage left window , attempts to lift it . It does n't budge . He tries again . No luck . STAPLES It 's frozen shut . A knock at the door . CHASE and STAPLES stare at each other , stare at the door , back at each other . STAPLES tries to lift the window again , screaming now . It still wo n't budge . CHASE shouts at him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , guttural noises and a kind of primitive gibberish . STAPLES moves as quickly as he can down the hall to the back of the apartment , like an astronaut in need of a toilet . Another knock . p. 28 CHASE Come in . The door opens very slowly . A nondescript man enters . He is thirtyish , clean-shaven . He wears a plain gray suit and a vague tie . He wears black , thick-rimmed glasses . He carries a half-dozen tulips arranged in a glass vase . He leaves the door open . He is painfully shy , but can get into the occasional groove just like anybody else .

GRAY HELDINWELL Speed ? CHASE Yeah , Speed . He just got here . Surprise visit . GRAY HELDINWELL Oh . What 's he doing ? CHASE He 's just sorta hanging out . GRAY turns toward the door . CHASE Take a seat GRAY stops , considers the chair again , turns toward the drum set , indicates that perhaps that would be a better choice , sits on a crate , accidentally steps on the kick drum pedal , jumps like a jackrabbit , practically annihilates the drum set , an explosion of sound . After a moment , he regains his composure , sits on the crate again . GRAY HELDINWELL So how 'd you hurt your back ?

CHASE Wow , Gray , you 're like pharmacologically blessed . GRAY HELDINWELL The Naproxen 's nothing to write home about , but an anti-inflammatory 's an anti-inflammatory . Seen one you 've seen them all . CHASE You 're so right . GRAY HELDINWELL ( rising off the crate , crossing toward the sofa ) I still have a pretty good relationship with my orthopedic guy . Doctor P , NYU Medical Center . CHASE Yeah , Doctor P , NYU Medical . Over there at GRAY HELDINWELL Thirty-first and First . CHASE Thirty-first and First . Right , right . GRAY HELDINWELL You should be okay in forty-eight to seventy-two hours . As long as it 's not a hot disc . You do n't have a hot disc do you ? p. 33 CHASE Oh , no way . My discs are totally cool and non-hot . GRAY HELDINWELL Then you 're probably in pretty good shape . CHASE God I hope so . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awkward pause . CHASE So , how long have you been in the building , Gray ? GRAY HELDINWELL A while . I just signed another lease . CHASE You like the neighborhood ? GRAY HELDINWELL Of course . CHASE We got the park . The Russian Bath House . That funny hat shop across the street . GRAY HELDINWELL That hat shop 's not funny . CHASE Oh . I was just saying  --  GRAY HELDINWELL I do n't think it 's funny at all . CHASE Okay . Pause . Someone farts again . CHASE Was that you or me ? GRAY HELDINWELL I think it was you . CHASE Oh . GRAY HELDINWELL ( collaboratively ) Maybe it was Speed ? p. 34 CHASE Right on . They share forced laughter . CHASE Care for a pill ? We have blues , pinks , and yellows . We call the yellows pissers . GRAY rises , considers the pills for a moment , backs away . GRAY HELDINWELL No thanks . Suddenly , STAPLES appears from the back of the apartment . He is still wearing the snowmobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow goggles . He walks up to the window very quickly , somehow trying to make himself invisible . He tries to lift it again . He is successful this time . He crawls through the window , closes it behind him , and disappears down the fire escape . GRAY is quite startled . GRAY HELDINWELL Who was that ? CHASE Huh ? GRAY HELDINWELL That man . CHASE What man ? GRAY HELDINWELL The one in the snowsuit . CHASE I did n't see anyone . GRAY HELDINWELL Oh . Well , a man in a snowsuit just walked through your living room , opened the window , and exited down the fire escape . CHASE Really ? p. 35 GRAY HELDINWELL Yeah . CHASE Are you sure , dude ? GRAY HELDINWELL Sure I 'm sure . GRAY rises , crosses toward the window , creeps up on it very slowly , seizes one of the dinette chairs , then looks out quickly . After a moment , he re-sets the chair , crosses to CHASE . GRAY HELDINWELL He 's not there anymore . GRAY crosses toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRAY crosses to the living room chair , confused , regards SPEED for a moment , sits . CHASE shifts to the other side of the sofa . He feigns pain . GRAY rises and attempts to help him , awkwardly reaching toward him , but never actually touching him . CHASE settles with his head against the stage right side of the sofa , still feigning pain . GRAY accidentally falls into CHASE 's lap face-first . GRAY stands very quickly . An awkward moment . GRAY attempts to regain his composure , makes his way back to the chair , sits . CHASE What do you do , Gray ? GRAY HELDINWELL Excuse me ? CHASE What . GRAY HELDINWELL I 'm not gay . p. 36 CHASE Huh ? GRAY HELDINWELL You think I 'm gay ? CHASE Dude , what are you talking ab  --  GRAY HELDINWELL ( standing ) Did n't you just ask me if I was gay ? CHASE Um , no . I asked you  --  GRAY HELDINWELL Are you trying to take advantage of me ? ! CHASE All I said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I know karate ! GRAY explodes with an exhibition of karate , approaching CHASE rather aggressively , CHASE stands on the sofa suddenly , somehow defusing the onslaught . CHASE I said WHAT-DO-YOU-DO , GRAY ! GRAY HELDINWELL Oh . CHASE WHOA ! GRAY HELDINWELL Sorry . CHASE NO ONE IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ANYONE ! GRAY HELDINWELL Oh . I 'm so sorry . CHASE , suddenly realizing that he is standing with little effort , begins feigning pain again , crumples down to the sofa . GRAY attempts to help him again , but CHASE wards him off . GRAY turns to the chair , where SPEED has managed to drape his arm over the cushion . p. 37 GRAY HELDINWELL ( crossing back to the chair ) I work for a prominent financial institution . CHASE Like a bank ? GRAY HELDINWELL It 's a little more complicated than that . CHASE Okay . GRAY HELDINWELL ( removing SPEED 's arm ) I 'm involved with the information side of things . Sorting and processing . I deal with data . CHASE You crunch numbers . GRAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do so much more than just crunch them . CHASE Like what ? GRAY HELDINWELL Well , I soften them too . I soften and crunch . And there 's a fair amount of spreading as well . CHASE Spreading ? GRAY HELDINWELL Sure . CHASE Like spreadsheets ? GRAY HELDINWELL Just spreading . CHASE Huh . Suddenly , GRAY whirls around in the chair really fast , desperately looks over both shoulders , stops , turns to CHASE . p. 38 GRAY HELDINWELL You sure you did n't see that guy in the snowsuit ? CHASE Pretty sure , Gray . SPEED suddenly pulls a deflated blowup doll from underneath the cushion of the chair , screams , bounds apelike toward the hallway , punches a hole in the Sheetrock . GRAY seizes the ottoman , raises it over his head as if to strike , but does n't . SPEED stares at him for a moment . SPEED Magilla Gorilla . SPEED crosses to the back of the apartment singing the first few verses of the " Magilla Gorilla " theme song , disappears . GRAY regains his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sits . GRAY HELDINWELL ( referring to SPEED ) You 're in a band . CHASE I am . GRAY HELDINWELL I 'll bet you did n't think I knew that . CHASE Well  --  GRAY HELDINWELL When you 've lived in the building as long as I have you pick up on certain things . The walls are filled with information , trust me on that one . You just have to know how to listen . CHASE Huh . GRAY HELDINWELL What are you guys called again ? p. 39 CHASE Well , we were called Lester 's Surprise , but then we changed it to Lester 's Sister . And then it was just Lester . I ca n't remember what we were after that . GRAY HELDINWELL Less . CHASE Excuse me ? GRAY HELDINWELL I think you were called Less after that . CHASE Really . GRAY HELDINWELL Uh-huh . CHASE Like less less ? GRAY HELDINWELL L-E-S-S . You guys used to put posters up all over the place . " Less is More . " CHASE Huh . GRAY rises , crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELDINWELL Yeah , I used to get out some . People to see , places to go , you know ? CHASE Sure . GRAY HELDINWELL But not so much lately . Too much to do . Projects . Big plans . Lots of ideas . GRAY sets the vase of tulips on top of the TV . CHASE Huh . GRAY HELDINWELL I have this lamp . White cut glass . It has a swan 's neck . The head is shaped like tulips . Ten of them . A bouquet . Gives a real nice soft glow . An astral glow . I think they put argon gas in the bulbs . At least it says that on the little tag . I found it in that old thrift shop across the street . It hardly cost anything . p. 40 CHASE Uh-huh ? GRAY HELDINWELL I 'll just stare at it for hours . I 'm not sure why . Sometimes I think I 'm waiting for it to talk to me . Like the tulips will tell me what to do . CHASE Huh . Pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHASE Approached ? GRAY HELDINWELL Yeah , approached . Carefully approached . CHASE By who ? GRAY HELDINWELL Two men . Very important men . CHASE When you say " approached "  --  GRAY HELDINWELL They just emerged . The way birds emerge . CHASE Birds . GRAY HELDINWELL Large , dark birds . You mind if I turn the light off ? CHASE Not at all . Gray vigilantly crosses to the neon beer sign , sets a chair to reach it , stands on the chair , turns the sign off . CHASE So what did these " very important " men do after they um " emerged " ? GRAY HELDINWELL ( still standing on the chair ) Handed me some pamphlets . Took my information . p. 41 CHASE What kinda information ? GRAY HELDINWELL Personal things . Height . Weight . Social Security number . Stuff like that . CHASE Wow . GRAY HELDINWELL They took a Polaroid , too . CHASE Friendly . GRAY HELDINWELL Yeah , I was wearing my hat . CHASE Your hat ? GRAY HELDINWELL From Millie 's Millinery . CHASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop across the street . CHASE Right . GRAY HELDINWELL ( stepping down from chair ) There 's a meeting tomorrow . Big meeting . CHASE With those guys who " approached " you . GRAY HELDINWELL I 'm not supposed to talk about it ! CHASE Okay . GRAY HELDINWELL They gave me some money . CHASE To not talk about it . GRAY HELDINWELL A lot of money . In a shoebox . It was heavier than if shoes were in it . p. 42 CHASE Cool . GRAY HELDINWELL I think a certain government official is in danger , let 's just say that . And like they said , he deserves to be . CHASE Sure . GRAY HELDINWELL I 'm willing to go to certain lengths . CHASE Of course . GRAY HELDINWELL Long Daniel 's going to be speaking on Public Access in a few minutes . CHASE Who 's that ? GRAY HELDINWELL Leader of the movement . CHASE One of the " money dudes " ? GRAY HELDINWELL Long Daniel 's the visionary . They work for him . He 's the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Public Access . Channel Sixteen . CHASE I 'd turn it on , Gray , but our TV 's like totally cashed . Suddenly , STAPLES appears in the window with a large TV . CHASE sees him . GRAY HELDINWELL Then I 'll go get mine . CHASE Your TV ? GRAY HELDINWELL Sure . CHASE Oh , no , you do n't have to do that ! p. 43 GRAY HELDINWELL But I want to . CHASE But it 's so inconvenient . And I would n't want you to hurt your back agai  --  GRAY HELDINWELL You do n't like me . CHASE Oh , that 's so not true ! GRAY HELDINWELL You find me repellent . GRAY crumples down to the ottoman , almost prostrate on the floor now . CHASE Gray . Hey . Hey now . I find you so totally not repellent . CHASE desperately signals to STAPLES to take GRAY 's TV back downstairs . STAPLES watches vaguely through the window for a moment , then nods , and disappears . GRAY checks behind him for a moment . GRAY HELDINWELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me at work . CHASE They talk to you . GRAY HELDINWELL No they do n't . CHASE Sure they do . GRAY HELDINWELL You do n't know . CHASE People just do n't not talk to people . GRAY HELDINWELL Just because I got caught with the rubber bands . p. 44 CHASE Rubber bands ? GRAY HELDINWELL A big blob of rubber bands . I could n't help it . CHASE Caught doing what exactly ? GRAY sits on the sofa . GRAY HELDINWELL I was putting them down my pants . CHASE Whoa . GRAY HELDINWELL Sometimes I 'll grab a handful . When my boss is n't looking . CHASE Oh . What does that like um do ? GRAY HELDINWELL It takes the loneliness away . CHASE Huh . GRAY HELDINWELL I think about the woods sometimes . Just getting away from it all . The smell of deer . Big timber . Blackbirds in the branches . Pause . CHASE Go get your TV , Gray . GRAY HELDINWELL Okay . GRAY rises , slowly crosses to the front door , turns back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , you know ? Then I could come up and visit whenever . CHASE Hey , it 's definitely worth discussing . p. 45 GRAY HELDINWELL Okay . GRAY turns to exit . CHASE What kinda TV is it ? GRAY HELDINWELL Magnavox nineteen-inch stereo surroundsound with master remote . CHASE The kinda remote that 's like heavy in your hand ? GRAY HELDINWELL Uh-huh . CHASE Totally go get it . GRAY HELDINWELL Okay . CHASE But Gray ? GRAY HELDINWELL Yeah ? CHASE moves himself to an upright position , feigning great pain . As before , GRAY reaches awkwardly , feebly , to help him , falls to his knees . Then suddenly , his hands find CHASE 's hair , his face , his beard . It 's more about the relief of physical human connection than anything sexual . Nonetheless , another awkward moment . CHASE Promise me you 'll be careful . GRAY HELDINWELL I will , Chase . GRAY rises , crosses to the door , stops , and turns back one more time . GRAY HELDINWELL Um . I 've never told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 GRAY HELDINWELL The rubber band thing . GRAY turns and exits . A moment later , LYNCH enters . There is ice in his beard . He is carrying a small MALE CHILD , perhaps six or seven and bundled in a hooded winter parka , scarf , and rollerblades . On the backs of both Rollerblades , the name " Pete " is spelled out in colorful decals . He is not wearing pants . One of his legs is discolored . His arms hang lifelessly at his sides . LYNCH is still wearing his snowmobile suit . He is also holding a black garbage bag containing a few lightweight objects . LYNCH Hey . CHASE Hey , dude Who 's that ? LYNCH Pete . CHASE Oh . Where 's he from ? LYNCH The park . CHASE Like the park park ? LYNCH Uh-huh . CHASE What were you doing in the park ? LYNCH Just walking around . CHASE Walking around , huh ? LYNCH Pretty much , yeah . The monkey bars were interesting . CHASE Is that where you found , um , Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the handball courts . This dog was tryin to mess with him but I took care of that . CHASE Where are his , like , pants ? LYNCH I do n't know . LYNCH starts for the kitchen area . CHASE Um , Lynch . LYNCH ( stopping ) Yeah ? CHASE Pete does n't look too good . LYNCH crosses to the kitchen table , sets the BOY in a chair , starts the oven , opens the oven door . CHASE What are you going , dude ? LYNCH Warming him up . CHASE Maybe you should like take him to the hospital . LYNCH He 's just cold . He 'll be okay . From the plastic garbage bag LYNCH removes two enormous , white , foam core animal masks : one is obviously a bear mask ; the other is a half-made elephant mask . CHASE What are those ? LYNCH Oh , I think Pete was making em . This one 's a bear . I think the other one 's sposed to be an elephant . ( putting the bear mask on ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 48 CHASE Um , how 's your toe , dude ? LYNCH It 's still numb . So is my leg . And I ca n't feel my knee . LYNCH unsnaps his snowmobile suit and long underwear , pushes them down to his ankles , standing naked now . He prods his knee a bit . LYNCH It 's still there , right ? CHASE Yeah , dude , it 's still there . GRAY enters with the TV , stops suddenly . GRAY HELDINWELL Hi . LYNCH Hi . GRAY HELDINWELL I 'm Gray . Awkward pause . CHASE Gray , this is Lynch . GRAY HELDINWELL Nice to meet you , Lynch . LYNCH does n't respond , just stands there , still wearing the mask . CHASE ( pointing to the BOY seated at the kitchen table ) And that 's , um , Pete . GRAY is confused . LYNCH Pete 's pretty shy . GRAY places the TV on the floor in front of the other one . He turns to LYNCH . GRAY HELDINWELL You 're wearing a bear mask . p. 49 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LYNCH Oh . Sorry . LYNCH pulls his long underwear back up , stands there for a moment . GRAY plugs in the TV , attaches the cable box , removes a large remote from his breast pocket , crosses to CHASE , almost hands it to him , then starts for the door . CHASE Where you going , Gray ? GRAY looks at LYNCH , then back to CHASE . GRAY HELDINWELL Um . They called me when I was downstairs . CHASE They . GRAY HELDINWELL Them . CHASE The " money dudes " ? GRAY looks at LYNCH , and then CHASE . GRAY HELDINWELL ( careful ) The call was in reference to that certain government official I was telling you about . They need me . CHASE They like need you need you ? GRAY HELDINWELL They sounded professionally desperate . CHASE For the " money job " ? GRAY HELDINWELL ( finally handing CHASE the remote ) It 's a Mission , yes . I have to go pack my knives . I should n't say anything else . p. 50 CHASE Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got ta go . GRAY is frozen . CHASE Gray . GRAY HELDINWELL Yes ? CHASE Maybe you should take a pill . GRAY crosses to the bowl of pills . GRAY HELDINWELL You think ? CHASE Oh , absolutely . GRAY HELDINWELL Which one ? CHASE Take a pink . GRAY takes a pink pill from the bowl , pops it in his mouth , then removes a nondescript mint green plastic bottle from his breast pocket , unscrews it , drinks , washing down the pill . CHASE Take two , dude . GRAY takes another pink , washes it down . CHASE Take a yellow , too . GRAY takes a yellow , washes it down , returns the bottle to his breast pocket . CHASE That should do it . GRAY HELDINWELL If you do n't see me anymore , I want you to have the TV . CHASE Okay . p. 51 GRAY HELDINWELL It 's good to feel like you 're a part of something . GRAY exits , closes the door . LYNCH So you do n't wan na be the elephant ? CHASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , dude . LYNCH Okay . LYNCH crosses to the BOY , lifts him out of the chair , starts for the back of the apartment with him . CHASE Lynch . LYNCH Yeah ? CHASE What are you gon na like do with , um , Pete ? LYNCH I was gon na play him a song . CHASE Oh . LYNCH But first I 'm gon na clean him . He 's pretty dirty . LYNCH exits down the hall with the BOY . Moments later , the window is opened . STAPLES climbs through with a large McDonald 's bag in his mouth . He no longer wears his hat and his snowsuit has been partly blown off . He is bare-chested . There is ice in his hair and beard . He closes the window , turns to CHASE . STAPLES ( as if caught in a blizzard ) SNOWSNOW AND ICESNOW AND ICE AND WINDSLEET IN THE TREESBIRDS FALLING TO THE PAVEMENTFROZEN PIGEONS ALL ACROSS TENTH STREETSO COLD THEY LOOK BLUEFROST CRAWLING UP THE SIDES OF BUILDINGSPEOPLE IN FRONT OF THEIR WINDOWS WEARING COATSSCARVESSKI MASKSTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happy Meal box , takes a seat on the stage-left end of the sofa , removes his own Happy Meal box , emptying the contents onto his lap . SPEED enters from the back of the apartment wearing a welding mask , still in his underwear . STAPLES hands him his Happy Meal box . CHASE hands his to SPEED as well . SPEED thrusts the Happy Meal boxes into the air victoriously , then crosses to the Happy Meal wall , offers the new additions to the Happy Meal gods . CHASE and STAPLES do n't eat , but simply play with the toys contained inside . CHASE uses the remote , finds his channel on the TV . Once again , the sound of the animal being tortured . CHASE and STAPLES are instantly mesmerized . LYNCH enters from the back of the apartment in long underwear . He is no longer wearing the bear mask . There is a large knitting needle sticking out of his right foot . He is carrying PETE , who has been bathed and is now dressed in a " LESS : LESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHASE and STAPLES have fallen asleep . LYNCH watches the TV for a moment , then crosses to the sofa , places PETE between CHASE and STAPLES , limps over to the TV , places the vase of tulips on the coffee table , then rears back and kicks in GRAY 's TV with his needled foot . CHASE and STAPLES continue sleeping . SPEED continues staring at the wall of Happy Meal boxes . LYNCH crosses to the keyboard , taps on SPEED 's welding mask . After no response he bends down , attempts to turns on the amp under the keyboard , fails , removes an electric guitar from under a heap of debris , plays unplugged while singing to the BOY : p. 52 LYNCH ( singing ) the element mancollecting noble gasesmonatomic planhelium scamargon passes he 's got a distance machinepowered by rocket fuelhe 's got a color TVand some microwave teato navigate his reprieve distance , area , and volumespace so hard to find LYNCH collapses , slowly gets to his feet . He crosses to the sofa , gathers the BOY in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " 40 Holes and 40 Goals " plays . During the song , LYNCH dances with the BOY . It 's a childlike waltz . He turns a few slow circles throughout the apartment . The dance eventually leads to the hallway and then to the back of the apartment . STAPLES wakes , watches LYNCH make his way to the back of the apartment with the BOY.there 's a hole in my headthere 's a hole in my pocketthere 's a hole in the floorthere 's a hole in the doori 'm gon na find it i 'm gon na fill it The light grows very dark and strange on the window .

Then another . Then several more . He swallows them all . He takes a pink . Swallows . And then a yellow .

After he has eaten all the petals , he sits in his spot on the sofa , leans back , staring **26;3125;TOOLONG STAPLES closes his eyes . The blue light slowly changes to a strange pink light on STAPLES . The song ends . Lights fade to black . Lights slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is now morning . As before , CHASE and STAPLES are asleep on the couch , STAPLES holding the stem of the eaten tulip . SPEED is back on the floor , now asleep , still wearing the welding mask . A cell phone rings four times , then ceases . LYNCH enters from the back of the apartment . He wears his long underwear . The areas of his shins , arms , forehead , thighs , face , and hands are grotesquely bloody . There are several needles sticking out of his foot . He is carrying his brick . He is also holding the elephant mask . A cell phone rings again . LYNCH stops , turns toward the sound of the cell phone . He leans over CHASE , grabs his cell phone , answers it . p. 53 LYNCH Hello ? Lynch Hey , Mr. Fitzsimmons Yeah , he 's here , but he 's sleeping Sure , I 'll give him a message Okay Bye . LYNCH turns the phone off , places it next to CHASE . He stares at him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHASE Hey , Lynch . LYNCH Hey . Your dad called . CHASE When ? LYNCH Just now . CHASE Oh . What 'd he want ? LYNCH He said he heard about the storm . CHASE What storm . LYNCH The snowstorm . He just wanted to let you know he heard about it . A beat . CHASE Dude , what happened ? LYNCH What . CHASE You 're all bloody . LYNCH I woke up in the middle of the night and this robot was hitting me with the brick But I took care of him There 's metal everywhere back there The brick falls to the floor . LYNCH slowly crosses to the window , looks out for a moment , then expires . GRAY enters . He is wearing the same gray suit and tie and an odd-shaped bowler hat . He is wet with snow . He is holding a bloody knife . There 's blood and vomit on the front of his suit . He is shivering. p. 54 GRAY HELDINWELL Hi . CHASE Hey , Gray . GRAY HELDINWELL Hi . GRAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Lots of snow . CHASE You 're holding a knife , dude . GRAY HELDINWELL Yeah . CHASE And there 's like blood on it . GRAY HELDINWELL When it goes in , it feels like nothing . It 's so light . Even . Like nowhere . You think there will be screaming . Fighting . Music in the background . Like on TV . But it 's not like that . Not if you put it in the way they show you . In the part where the voice makes a noise . It was so quiet . And he just sat down . He just sat down like he was old and tired . Like he 'd walked for a long time and needed to rest It 's so good to feel like you 're a part of something . GRAY crosses to the tulips , gathers them in his arms . GRAY HELDINWELL My lamp broke . I knocked it over when I unplugged the TV . Broke into a thousand pieces . It 's really cold down there . ( he starts to weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be really still . Just a few days . p. 55 CHASE Sure , Gray , sure . GRAY HELDINWELL I wo n't move , hardly at all . CHASE No problem buddy . GRAY HELDINWELL I heard the Sun 's coming . GRAY slowly crosses to the beer sign , steps onto the chair , turns it on . His movements are very slow , as though he is coming to some kind of expiration . He turns the sign on and starts to arrange the tulips in the light over the following : CHASE ( to GRAY ) I had this dream last night I was a robot Big metal robot I was crying but nothing was coming out No tears And I did n't have any balls Instead I had a light switch I kept trying to turn it on but all it did was make this buzzing noise CHASE plants his feet on the floor for the first time , slowly stands , takes in the room for a moment . CHASE ( to GRAY ) I I ca n't feel my feet . STAPLES 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . He checks . It 's not . He turns to STAPLES at the other end of the sofa . The cell phone rings again . CHASE reaches over , shakes him . STAPLES does n't stir . CHASE touches his cheek , draws his hand back , quickly retreats to his side of the sofa . GRAY continues to stare at the tulips arranged in the beer light . SPEED slowly begins to rise off the floor . CHASE starts to weep . Blackout as the cell phone rings through the silence . Lights up . The apartment is still dark but a soft yellow light is starting to come through the window . CHASE is holding an electric guitar , ready to play . STAPLES is at one of the microphone stands , upright , very much alive . SPEED is seated at the drum set , no longer wearing the welding mask . LYNCH is facing the drums , strapped with the bass . STAPLES starts to sing " The Astronaut 's Lament . " It starts slowly and then builds into an up-beat pop song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAPLES ( singing ) in the very tiny hourswhen the night turns into the daywhen your spaceships comeand steal your plansand make your blue skies change to gray i sit alone in my roomhow can i be sc lazywhen the astronauts are giving it one more trywhy does the stratosphere look so hazy ?

The whole of it turns into an extended jam session with inspired improvisation . After a minute or so , they find the bass line and return to the chorus.and he went down , down , down , downdown to the end of the pier he jumped and drowned , drowned , drowned , drownedbut he could n't get there from here and he went down , down , down , downdown to the end of the pierhe jumped and drowned , drowned , drowned , drownedbut he could n't get there from here On the final run of the drums , before the crash of the symbols , the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
