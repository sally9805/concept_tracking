Introduction : Who Is Tiptree , What Is He ? No one ... has , to my knowledge , ever met Tiptree , ever seen him , ever talked with him on the phone . No one knows where he lives , what he looks like , what he does for a living . ... He volunteers no information about his personal life , and politely refuses to answer questions about it . ... Most SF people ... are wild to know who Tiptree " really " is.  - -  Gardner Dozois , 1976 In 1921 in the Belgian Congo , a six-year-old girl from Chicago with a pith helmet on her blond curls walks at the head of a line of heavily laden native porters . Her mother walks next to her , holding a rifle and her daughter 's hand . In 1929 , the girl huddles under quilts in a cabin in the Great North Woods , reading Weird Tales . The candle by her bed flickers as an alien gently removes a young human 's brassiere . On Christmas Eve 1934 , a nineteen-year-old in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party she meets a handsome , dark-haired boy in a tie and tails . She makes a joke ; he laughs , and makes another . Five days later they elope and marry . In 1942 , a divorce wearing three-inch heels and a fox fur jacket goes down to a Chicago recruiting station and enlists in the army . Sometime in the near future , a woman and a man meet an extraterrestrial exploring party . The man tries to protect the woman . The woman says she does n't believe in women 's chances on Earth , and asks the aliens to take her away . In 1970 , a man who does not exist sits down at a typewriter . He writes , " At last I have what every child wants , a real secret life . Not an official secret , not a **29;602;TOOLONG **34;633;TOOLONG secret , nobody else 's damn secret but MINE . " James Tiptree , Jr. , appeared on the science fiction scene in the late 1960s , writing fast-paced , action-filled stories about rocket ships , alien sex , and intergalactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a voice like no one else 's : knowing , intense , utterly convinced of its authority and the urgency of its message . No one had ever seen or spoken to the owner of this voice . He wrote letters , warm , frank , funny letters , to other writers , editors , and science fiction fans . His correspondence was intimate and revealing , yet even his closest friends knew little more about " Tip " than his address : a post office box in McLean , Virginia . He was rumored to be a government official or secret agent . He did seem to know a lot about spooks around the water cooler : his characters worked in " an unimportant bit of C.I.A . " or remarked , " Paranoia has n't been useful in my business for years , but the habit is hard to break . " He had opinions about fishing , duck hunting , and politics . He was courtly and flirtatious with women . When one of his friends , the writer Robert Silverberg , sent him a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " shaved and applied lotion " before reading on . Silverberg pictured Tip as " a man of 50 or 55 , I guess , possibly unmarried , fond of outdoor life , restless in his everyday existence , a man who has seen much of the world and understands it well . " Men looked up to him . His women friends fell in love . The stories that came out of PO Box 315 became more and more brilliant and disturbing . It was n't the sex , and it was n't the death , but it was the combination of the two . His stories read like urgent messages from some haunted house on the corner of Eros and Mortality . Humans meet aliens -- and abandon their very souls for a chance to sleep with them . A man in love with the Earth kills off the human race , including himself , to save her . A mission to the stars finds an alien egg for which the colonists themselves turn out to be the sperm . Like Philip K. Dick , Tiptree used science fiction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to be human -- though he was less likely than Dick to question reality . Reality is there ; the human project is to learn to see it , or die . Or learn to see ourselves : the reality of human flesh and emotions was what terrified , and fascinated , Tiptree . Can the body be trusted ? Will it betray us ? What does it want ? Can we get rid of it ? This masculine writer , who let his readers in on the technology of space flight and the inner workings of government , also showed a surprising sympathy toward his female characters . He wrote about women 's alienation in a world of men , and was held up as an example of a male feminist , a man who understood . Still , his stories were so full of action , philosophy , and desire for women that everyone knew they were dealing with a man . In 1975 , in an introduction to a book of Tiptree 's short stories , Robert Silverberg wrote of his friend , " It has been suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there is to me something ineluctably masculine about Tiptree 's writing . " He likened Tiptree 's " lean , muscular , supple " stories to Hemingway 's : Hemingway was a deeper and trickier writer than he pretended to be ; so too with Tiptree , who conceals behind an aw-shucks artlessness an astonishing skill for shaping scenes and misdirecting readers into unexpected abysses of experience . And there is , too , that prevailing masculinity about both of them -- that preoccupation with questions of courage , with absolute values , with the mysteries and passions of life and death as revealed by extreme physical tests , by pain and suffering and loss . In the same year , another of Tiptree 's letter-friends , the feminist science fiction writer Joanna Russ , wrote him that a professor at a party had " asked me if you were a woman ( ! ) by which I gather he ca n't recognize a female point of view if it bites him . " When Tiptree participated in a written symposium on " Women in Science Fiction " as a token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas " no woman could even think , or understand , let alone assent to . " By then Tiptree had introduced a protge , Raccoona Sheldon , who seemed strongly influenced by Tiptree 's style . No one , not even herself , had opinions about Raccoona 's sex : she was a former schoolteacher who published little and wrote , " As for me , really the less said the better . " Tiptree did reveal a few facts about himself . He had been born in Chicago . His parents had been African explorers and his mother a writer . He had spent part of his childhood in colonial Africa , and the Second World War " in a Pentagon sub-basement . " He was reluctant to reveal his true identity because he could n't have the people around him know he was writing science fiction , and because he liked his secret life . Then in late 1976 , Tiptree told a few friends that his elderly mother had died . More than one of Tip 's correspondents checked the Chicago papers and found an obituary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African explorer . Under " survivors " was listed her only child : Alice Bradley ( Mrs. Huntington ) Sheldon . Ten years later , shortly before her death by suicide , Alli Sheldon wrote , " My secret world had been invaded and the attractive figure of Tiptree -- he did strike several people as attractive -- was revealed as nothing but an old lady in Virginia . " Alice Hastings Bradley Davey Sheldon , 1915 -- 1987 As it turned out , the sixty-one-year-old Alice Sheldon , known as Alli , was just as attractive a figure as Tiptree had ever been , opinionated and theatrical , with a past that she revealed , bit by bit , in tantalizing anecdotes . The few friends she allowed into the home in McLean that she shared with her husband , Huntington " Ting " Sheldon , were fascinated by this eloquent storyteller . The writer Gardner Dozois called her " one of the most fascinating conversationalists I 've ever met , brilliant , theatrical , far-ranging , strikingly perceptive . " David Hartwell , her editor , said " Alli was electrifying , ... enchanting both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she started writing science fiction she had already been a painter and an airforce intelligence officer . She had eloped with the " beautiful alcoholic poet " who had been seated on her left at her debut . She had worked for the CIA . She had earned a Ph.D . in experimental psychology . She had published a story in the New Yorker . She had begun and thrown out essays , scientific works , and novels . She was born in 1915 as Alice Hastings Bradley , the cute , blue-eyed only child of two extraordinary parents . Her father , Herbert Bradley , was a lawyer who led three expeditions into unmapped Central Africa . Her mother , Mary Hastings Bradley , was a highly successful author of travel books and popular fiction . Both adult Bradleys were charismatic , energetic , public people whose adventures gave the family an exotic air . Mary Bradley was an enormous presence in Alli 's life : magnetic , generous , theatrical , extremely long-lived . Tiptree described his mother as a kind of explorer-heroine , highly literate ( Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You help her through doors -- and then find out she can hike 45 miles up a mountain carrying her rifle and yours . And repeat next day . And joke . And dazzling looks ... I am still approached by doddering wrecks , extinguished Scandinavian savants or what have you who want to tell me about Mother as a young woman . Alli called her a dazzling and formidable little person , a " queen bee " with two adoring males in addition to her husband . ( In our Victorian culture they were Father 's best friends . ) She was gifted , beautiful , emotional , accomplished ; a linguist , writer , spell-binding conversationalist -- and a superb shot and brave endurer of considerable real hardships . ... She did n't provide a model for me , she provided an impossibility . Mary encouraged her daughter , first as an artist and then as a writer . But what Alli needed to say was not within the scope even of Mary 's wide world , and what she did not learn from Mary 's example was that women could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful in order to speak at all . Besides , Mary took up a great deal of emotional and creative space , writing her daughter 's story , literally , in two children 's books about the Bradleys ' African travels . It took a radical subterfuge -- taking on a new name , pretending to be a man , turning into a new person -- for Alli to get that story back , to become someone else besides her mother 's daughter . Tiptree was n't only a trick for saying things Alli could n't . Like all interesting people , Alli had many sides or selves , and Tiptree gave her more room to be those selves : worldly , analytical , independent , bloodthirsty , and funny . He gave her space to play , make jokes , or , on a bad day , annihilate the human race . He gave her space to love women ( though not always to like them ) . Sometimes he said things she did n't have words for , in the days when no one wrote honestly about women 's experience . Many artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , a secret self very much unlike the " me " of their daily interactions . Tiptree was that person for Alli : a writer who ( he once said ) longed to stop sweating over words and drafts and instead " storm naked with hard-on waving thru the world spouting whatever comes . " Tiptree helped Alli to write partly because he wrote science fiction . " Literature , " with its famous injunction to " write what you know , " can not always help us discover what we do n't know . Science fiction gave Alli a language for writing around the boundaries , for imagining what can not yet be said . It has been seen as a masculine genre . And yet , with its metaphors for alienation and otherness , its unruly imagination , and its power to predict change , it is highly suited to talking about women 's experience . Alli chose her male pseudonym on a whim , in a supermarket , where a jar of Tiptree jam caught Alli 's eye . She was sending out some science fiction stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors would n't remember rejecting . " But the male name turned out to have many uses . It made her feel taken seriously when she wrote about what she knew : guns , hunting , politics , war . It let her write the way she wanted to write , with an urgency that was hers . It gave her enough distance and control to speak honestly about herself . In 1931 , when Alice Bradley was fifteen , Virginia Woolf wrote " Professions for Women , " with its famous image of the imagination diving deep into the stream and the woman writer forced to pull it back . In one of Woolf 's drafts , the writer explains to her imagination , " I can not make use of what you tell me -- about womens bodies for instance -- their passions -- and so on , because the conventions are still very strong . If I were to overcome the conventions I should need the courage of a hero ... I doubt that a writer can be a hero . I doubt that a hero can be a writer . " Alice longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth about her experience . But she did n't have the words for that experience , or the rare courage to become a literary heroine . Instead , late in life , she became one of our greatest literary tricksters . Tiptree never pretended to be a man in person . Yet Tiptree 's appropriation of the male mind is even more exciting . It 's a much deeper challenge to the established narrative order , and promises a greater freedom . It questions all our assumptions about writing and gender . It changes how we look at our male writer heroes . As science historian Donna Haraway has suggested , Tiptree takes the figure of the Great White Hunter and reconfigures it for a postcolonial , postgender world . And it speaks , in a way no other writer 's life has , to the ongoing problem of writing as a woman . Which is not to say that Alice wrote only about or for women . She wanted to lose her gender partly because , like Woolf , she did n't want to write for half the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems she raised . Tiptree 's stories most often end in death -- for the protagonist , the crew , the colony , or the planet . In the same way , Alli put an end to her own story . She and her husband Ting agreed to commit suicide together when they became too old to go on . On May 19 , 1987 , when she was seventy-one and Ting eighty-four , she shot him and then herself . Since her death , her work has gone on finding new audiences and influencing new writers , from cyberpunk authors like William Gibson to those who imagine the future of gender and sexuality . Tiptree now stands alongside Philip K. Dick and Ursula K. Le Guin as one of the twentieth century 's most important and exciting writers of fantastic literature in America . While new generations of readers are drawn to her prescient work , her passionate life and tragic death have much to tell us about what it means to write -- and to be human . And her performance as Tiptree , with its reversal of everything we expect about men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her greatest influence of all . Names Certainly let us be on first names ; mine is Alli . ( " Alice " carries joyless connotations of " Alice , eat your spinach . " " Alice , go to bed . " ... )  - -  Alli Sheldon Alice Sheldon disliked her first name , which she felt did not belong to her . " ' Alice , ' it was made clear to me early , belonged to my mother , who chose it because it had no nickname . How cruel can you get , unintentionally -- I hope ? But one 's nicknames -- they are one 's own , " she wrote Joanna Russ . She herself was an " inveterate nicknamer " who loved playing with names and was thrilled when her mother-in-law shortened her name to " Alli . " She gave her own pseudonyms nicknames : " Tip " for Tiptree , and " Raccoona " for a woman writer with a mask . In writing this book I have called James Tiptree Jr . " Tiptree " or " Tip "  - -  he never used " James "  - -  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like many women , Alice changed her name over the course of her life , from Alice Hastings Bradley to Alice Davey to Alice Sheldon . Alice Bradley Davey was her first byline . She also wrote as Alice Bradley , used the name " Ann Terry " on an early , unpublished science fiction story , and signed a rude letter " Mrs. H. D. Smith . " In letters of feminist protest , on cream-colored stationery , she was Mrs. Huntington D. Sheldon , adding , " PS . I am not a ' radical ' but a stuffy suburban matron who buys your advertisers ' products . " As a research psychologist she was Dr. Alice B. Sheldon . Franz Kafka 's biographer can and does call his subject " Kafka " from infancy , but what can I call mine ? I have tried to call Major Alice Hastings Bradley Davey Sheldon , Ph.D. , by the names she used at different times , and have mostly taken the liberty of using the name she liked best : Alli.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
