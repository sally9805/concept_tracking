Isi 1947 NICK HAUSER AND I had only two loves in this world-baseball and Cheerio yo-yo contests . That 's how we met Benny , one spring night after a doubleheader out at Buffalo Stadium on the Galveston Freeway . His brand new Ford convertible , a gleaming maroon job with a starch-white top , whitewall tires , and blue-dot taillights , was stuck in a sodden field behind the bleachers . Benny was trying to lift the bumper while his girlfriend floored the accelerator , spinning the tires and blowing streams of muddy water and torn grass back in his face . <p> He wore a checkered sports coat , lavender shirt , hand-painted necktie , and two-tone shoes , all of it now whipsawed with mud . But it was his eyes , not his clothes , that you remembered . They were a radiant blue and literally sparkled . <p> " You punks want to earn two bucks each ? " he said . <p> " Who you calling a punk ? " Nick said . <p> Before Benny could answer , his girlfriend shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . <p> He hopped up and down , holding one shin , trying to bite down on his pain , his eyes lifted heavenward , his lips moving silently . <p> " Get in the fucking car before it sinks in this slop again ! " his girlfriend yelled . <p> He limped to the passenger side . A moment later they nshtailed across the grass past us . Her hair was long , blowing out the window , the pinkish red of a flamingo . She thumbed a hot cigarette into the darkness . <p> " Boy , did you check out that babe 's bongos ? Wow ! " Nick said . <p> But our evening encounter with Benny and his girlfriend was not over . We were on the shoulder of the freeway , trying to hitch a ride downtown , flicking our Cheerios under a streetlamp , doing a whole range of upper-level yo-yo tricks-Round the World , Shoot the Moon , Rock the Cradle , and the Atomic Bomb-when the maroon convertible roared past us , blowing dust and newspaper in our faces . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a U-turn , then a second U-turn , horns blowing all over the freeway , and braked to a stop abreast of us . <p> " You know who I am ? " Benny said . <p> " No , " I replied . <p> " My name is Benjamin Siegel . " <p> " You 're a gangster , " Nick said . <p> " He 's got you , Benny , " the woman behind the wheel said . <p> " How you know that ? " Benny said . <p> " We heard your name on Gangbusters . Nick and me listen every Saturday night , " I said . <p> " Can you do the Chinese Star ? " he asked . <p> " We do Chinese Stars in our sleep , " Nick said . <p> " Get in , " Benny said , pulling back the leather seat . <p> " We got to get home , " I said . <p> " We 'll take you there . Get in , " he said . <p> We drove out South Main , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them hung with Spanish moss . To the south , heat lightning flickered over the Gulf of Mexico . Benny bought us fried chicken and ice cream at Bill Williams Drive-in , and while we ate , his girlfriend smoked cigarettes behind the wheel and listened to the radio , her thoughts known only to herself , her face so soft and lovely in the dash light I felt something drop inside me when I stole a look at it . <p> Benny popped open the glove box and removed a top-of-the-line chartreuse Cheerio yo-yo . Behind the yo-yo I could see the steel surfaces of a semiautomatic pistol . " Now show me the Chinese Star , " he said . <p> He stood with us in the middle of the drive-in parking lot , watching Nick and me demonstrate the intricate patterns of the most difficult of all the Cheerio competition tricks . Then he tried it himself . His yo-yo tilted sideways , its inner surfaces brushing against the string , then twisted on itself and went dead . <p> " The key is candle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . <p> " Yeah , you wrap the string around a candle and saw it back and forth . That gives you the spin and the time you need to make the pattern for the star , " I said . <p> " I never thought of that , " he said . <p> " It 's a breeze , " Nick said . <p> " Benny , give it a rest , " his girlfriend said from inside the car . <p> Fifteen minutes later we dropped off Nick at his house on the dead-end street where I used to be his neighbor . It was a wonderful street , one of trees and flowers and old brick homes , and a horse pasture dotted with live oaks beyond the canebrake that enclosed the cul-du-sac . But when my father died my mother and I were evicted , and we moved across Westheimer and took up residence in a neighborhood where every sunrise broke on the horizon like a testimony to personal failure . <p> Benny 's girlfriend pulled to a stop in front of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rust on the screens . " This is where you live ? " he asked . <p> " Yeah , " I said , my eyes leaving his . <p> He nodded . " You need to study hard , make something of yourself . Go out to California , maybe . It 's the place to be , " he said . <p> Our next-door neighbors were the Dunlops . They had skin like pig hide and heads with the knobbed ridges of coconuts . The oldest of the five boys was executed in Huntsville Pen ; one did time on Sugarland Farm . The patriarch of the family was a security guard at the Southern Pacific train yards . He covered all the exterior surfaces of his house , garage , and tool shed with the yellow paint he stole from his employer . The Dunlops even painted their car with it . Then , through a fluke no one could have anticipated , they became rich . <p> One of the girls had married a morphine addict who came from an oil family in River Oaks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bus outside San Antonio , and the Dunlops inherited two hundred thousand dollars and a huge chunk of rental property in their own neighborhood . It was like giving a tribe of pygmies a nuclear weapon . <p> I thought the Dunlops would move out of their dilapidated two-story frame house , with its piles of dog shit all over the backyard , but instead they bought a used Cadillac from a mortuary , covered their front porch with glitter-encrusted chalk animals and icons from an amusement park , and continued each morning to piss out the attic window onto my mother 's car , which looked like it had contracted scabies . <p> As newly empowered landlords , the Dunlops cut no one any slack , did no repairs on their properties , and evicted a Mexican family who had lived in the neighborhood since the middle of the Depression . Mr. Dunlop also seized upon an opportunity to repay the parochial school Nick and I attended for expelling two of his sons . <p> Maybe it was due to the emotional deprivation and the severity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore in ninety-degree humidity , but a significant number of the nuns at school were inept and cruel . Sister Felicie , however , was not one of these . She was tall , and wore steel-rimmed glasses and small black shoes that did n't seem adequate to support her height . When I spent almost a year in bed with rheumatic fever , she came every other day to the house with my lessons , walking a mile , sometimes in the hottest of weather , her habit powdered with ash from a burned field she had to cross . <p> But things went south for Sister Felicie . We heard that her father , a senior army officer , was killed on Okinawa . Some said the soldier was not her father but the fianc she had given up when she entered the convent . Regardless , at the close of the war a great sadness seemed to descend upon her . <p> In the spring of ' 47 she would take her science class on walks through the neighborhood , identifying trees , plants , and flowers along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would end up at Costen 's Drug Store , and she would let everyone take a rest break on the benches under the awning . It was a grand way to end the school day because on some afternoons the Cheerio yo-yo man would arrive at exactly 3:05 and hold competitions on the corner . <p> But one day , just after the dismissal bell had rung across the street , I saw Sister Felicie walk into the alleyway between the drug store and Cobb 's Liquors and give money to a black man who had an empty eye socket . A few minutes later I saw her upend a small bottle of fortified wine , what hobos used to call short-dogs , then drop it surreptitiously into a trash can . <p> She turned and realized I had been watching her . She walked toward me , between the old brick walls of the buildings , her small shoes clicking on pieces of gravel and bottle caps and broken glass , her face stippled with color inside her wimple . " Why are n't you waxing your string for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has n't started yet , Sister , " I replied , avoiding her look , trying to smile . <p> " Better run on now , " she said . <p> " Are you all right , Sister ? " I said , then wanted to bite off my tongue . <p> " Of course I 'm all right . Why do you ask ? " <p> " No reason . None . I just do n't think too good sometimes , Sister . You know me . I was just- " <p> But she was n't listening now . She walked past me toward the red light at the corner , her habit and beads swishing against my arm . She smelled like camphor and booze and the lichen in the alley she had bruised under her small shoes . <p> Two days later the same ritual repeated itself . Except this time Sister Felicie did n't empty just one short-dog and head for the convent . I saw her send the black man back to Cobb 's for two more bottles , then she sat down on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book spread on her knees as though she were reading , the bottles on the ground barely hidden by the hem of her habit . <p> That 's when Mr. Dunlop and his son Vernon showed up . Vernon was seventeen and by law could not be made to attend school . That fact was a gift from God to the educational system of southwest Houston . Vernon had half-moon scars on his knuckles , biceps the size of small muskmelons , and deep-set simian eyes that focused on other kids with the moral sympathies of an electric drill . <p> Mr. Dunlop was thoroughly enjoying himself . First , he announced to everyone within earshot he was the owner of the entire corner , including the drug store . He told the Cheerio yo-yo man to beat it and not come back , then told the kids to either buy something inside the store or get off the benches they were loitering on . <p> His face lit like a jack-o ' - lantern 's when he saw Sister Felicie emerge from the alley . She was trying to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , one hand touching the brick wall of the drug store , a drop of sweat running from the top edge of her wimple down the side of her nose . <p> " Looks like you got a little bit of the grog in you , Sister , " Mr. Dunlop said . <p> " What were you saying to the children ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , her ladyship wants to know that , does she ? Why do n't we have a conference with the pastor and hash it out ? " Mr. Dunlop said . <p> " Do as you wish , " Sister replied , then walked to the red light with the cautious steps of someone aboard a pitching ship . <p> Mr. Dunlop dropped a buffalo nickel into a pay phone , an unlit cigarette in the corner of his mouth . His head was shaved bald , his brow knurled , one eye recessed and glistening with pleasure when someone picked up on the other end . " Father ? " Mr. Dunlop said . <p> His son Vernon squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheerio yo-yo man did not come back to the corner and Sister Felicie disappeared from school for a week . Then one Monday morning she was back in class , looking joyless and glazed , as though she had just walked out of an ice storm . <p> That afternoon Benny and his girlfriend pulled into my driveway while I was picking up the trash Vernon and his brothers had thrown out of their attic window into the yard . " I ca n't get the Atomic Bomb right . Get in the car . We 'll pick up your friend on the way out , " he said . <p> " Way where ? " I said . <p> " The Shamrock . You want to go swimming and have some eats , do n't you ? " he said . <p> " I 'll leave my mom a note , " I said . <p> " Tell her to come out and join us . " <p> That definitely will not flush , I thought , but did not say it . <p> Benny had said he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth was he could n't even master Walk the Dog . In fact , I could n't figure why a man with his wealth and criminal reputation would involve himself so intensely with children 's games . After Nick and I went swimming , we sat on the balcony of Benny 's suite , high above the clover-shaped pool of the Shamrock hotel , and tried to show him the configurations of the Atomic Bomb . It was a disaster . He would spread the string between his fingers , then drop the yo-yo through the wrong spaces , knotting the string , rendering it useless . He danced up and down on the balls of his feet in frustration . <p> " There 's something wrong with this yo-yo . I 'm gon na go back to the guy who sold it to me and stuff it down his throat , " he said . <p> " He 's full of shit , kids , " his girlfriend said through the open bathroom door . <p> " Do n't listen to that . You 're looking at the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Then he yelled through the French doors into the suite , " Tell me I 'm full of shit one more time . " <p> " You 're full of shit , " she yelled back . <p> " That 's what you got to put up with , " he said to us . " Now , teach me the Atomic Bomb . " <p> Blue black clouds were piled from the horizon all the way to the top of the sky , blooming with trees of lightning that made no sound . Across the street we could see oil rigs pumping in an emerald green pasture and a half dozen horses starting to spook at the weather . Benny 's girlfriend came out of the bathroom , dressed in new jeans and a black and maroon cowboy shirt with a silver stallion on the pocket . She drank from a vodka collins , and her mouth looked cold and hard and beautiful when she lowered the glass . <p> " Anybody hungry ? " she said . <p> I felt myself swallow . Then , for reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mr. Dunlop had done to Sister Felicie . Benny listened attentively , his handsome face clouding , his fingers splaying his knotted yo-yo string in different directions . " Say all that again ? This guy Dunlop ran off the Cheerio man ? " he said . <p> It was almost Easter and at school that meant the Stations of the Cross and a daily catechism reminder about the nature of disloyalty and human failure . When he needed them most , Christ 's men bagged it down the road and let him take the weight on his own . I came to appreciate the meaning of betrayal a little better that spring . <p> I thought my account of Mr. Dunlop 's abuse of Sister Felicie and the Cheerio man had made Benny our ally . He 'd said he would come by my house the next night and straighten out Mr. Dunlop and anyone else who was pushing around kids and nuns and yo-yo instructors . He said these kinds of guys were Nazis and should be boiled into lard and poured into soap molds . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys . You taught me the Atomic Bomb and the Chinese Star . " <p> The next day , after school , when I was raking leaves in the yard , Vernon used his slingshot to shoot me in the back with a marble . I felt the pain go into the bone like a cold chisel . <p> " Got a crick ? " he said . <p> " Yeah , " I said , mindlessly , squeezing my shoulders back , my eyes shut . <p> " How about some hair of the dog that bit you ? " he said , fishing another marble out of his shirt pocket . <p> " You screwed with Benny Siegel , Vernon . He 's going to stuff you in a toilet bowl , " I said . <p> " Yeah ? Who is Benny Sea Gull ? " <p> " Ask your old man . Oh , I forgot . He ca n't read , either . " <p> Vernon 's fist came out of the sky and knocked me to the ground . I felt the breath go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a giant vacuum cleaner . Through the kitchen window , I could see my mother washing dishes , her face bent down toward the sink . Vernon unbuckled my belt , worked the top button loose on my jeans , and pulled them off my legs , dragging me through the dust . The clouds , trees , garage , alleyway , even the dog dumps , spun in circles around me . Vernon pulled one of my pants legs inside out and used it to blow his nose . <p> Benny and his girlfriend did not show up at my house that night . I called the Shamrock hotel and asked for his room . <p> " There 's no one registered here by that name , " the clerk said . <p> " Has he checked out ? " <p> There was a pause . " We have no record of a guest with that name . I 'm sorry . Thank you for calling the Shamrock , " the clerk said , and hung up . <p> The next day at recess I saw Sister Felicie sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden behind the church . Her black habit was spangled with sunlight , and her beads lay across her open palm as though the wind had robbed her of her concentration . Her face looked like ceramic , polished , faintly pink , not quite real . She smelled of soap or perhaps shampoo in her close-cropped hair , which was covered with a skull cap and veil that must have been unbearable in the summer months . <p> " You 're supposed to be on the playground , Charlie , " she said . <p> " I told Benny Siegel what Mr. Dunlop did to you . He promised to help . But he did n't show up last night , " I said . <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " Benny is a gangster . Nick and I have been teaching him yo-yo tricks . He built a casino in Nevada . " <p> " I 'm convinced you 'll be a great writer one day , " she said , and for the first time in weeks she smiled . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you again , at least for a while . But you 'll be in my prayers . " <p> " Not see you ? " <p> " Run along now . Do n't hang out with too many gangsters . " <p> She patted me on top of the head , then touched my cheek . <p> Benny had shown Nick and me color photographs of the resort hotel and gambling casino he had built in the desert . He also showed us a picture of him and his girlfriend building a snowman in front of a log cabin in west Montana . In the photograph she was smiling and looked much younger , somehow innocent among evergreens that rang with winter light . She wore a fluffy pink sweater and knee-length boots stitched with Christmas designs . <p> I kept wanting to believe Benny would call or come by , but he did n't . I dreamed about a building in a desert , its exterior scrolled with neon , a grassy pond on one side of it where flamingos stood in the water , arching their necks , pecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away my Cheerio yo-yo and no longer listened to ballgames at Buffalo Stadium . I refused to eat , without understanding why , threw my lunch in a garbage can on the way to school , and fantasized about hurting Vernon Dunlop . <p> " We 'll set fire to his house , " Nick said . <p> " Serious ? " I said , looking up from the box of shoes we were shining in his garage . <p> " It 's a thought , " he replied . <p> " What if somebody gets killed ? " <p> " That 's the breaks when you 're white trash , " Nick said . He grinned , his face full of play . He had a burr haircut and the overhead light reflected on his scalp . Nick was a good boxer , swallowed his blood in a fight , and never let anyone know when he was hurt . secretly I always wished I was as tough as he was . <p> He and I had a shoe-shine route . We collected shoes from all over the neighborhood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one color polish-brown ; home delivery was free . Nick peeled open a Milky Way and bit into it . He chewed thoughtfully , then offered the candy bar to me . I shook my head . <p> " You got to eat , " he said . <p> " Who says ? " I replied . <p> " You make me sad , Charlie , " he said . <p> My father was an old-time pipeline man whose best friend was killed by his side on the last day of World War I. He read classical literature , refused to mow the lawn under any circumstances , spent more days than he should have in the beer joint , attended church irregularly , and contended there were only two facts you had to remember about the nature of God : that He had a sense of humor and , as a gentleman , He never broke His word . <p> The last part always stuck with me . <p> Benny had proved himself a liar and a bum . My sense of having been used by him seemed to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when my hunger was eating its way through my insides like a starving organism that had to consume its host in order to survive . I had bed spins when I woke in the morning and vertigo when I rode my bike to school , wobbling between automobiles while the sky , trees , and buildings around me dissolved into a vortex of atomic particles . <p> My mother tried to tempt me from my abstinence with a cake she baked and the following day with a codfish dinner she brought from the cafeteria , wrapped in foil , butter oozing from an Irish potato that was still hot from the oven . <p> I rushed from the house and pedaled my bike to Nick 's . We sat inside the canebrake at the end of our old street , while the day cooled and the evening star twinkled in the west . There was a bitter taste in my mouth , like the taste of zinc pennies . <p> " You miss your dad ? " Nick asked . <p> " I do n't think about it much anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad about an accident ? " I replied , turning my face from his , looking at the turquoise rim along the bottom of the sky . <p> " My old man always says your dad was stand-up . " <p> " Benny Siegel treated us like jerks , Nick , " I said . <p> " Who cares about Benny Siegel ? " <p> I did n't have an answer for him , nor could I explain why I felt the way I did . <p> I rode my bike home in the dusk , then found a heavy rock in the alley and threw it against the side of the Dunlops ' house . It struck the wood so hard the glass in the windows rattled . Vernon came out on the back porch , eating a piece of fried chicken , his body silhouetted in the kitchen light . He wore a strap undershirt and his belt was unbuckled , hanging loosely over his fly . <p> " You 're lucky , dick wipe . I got a date tonight . But wait till tomorrow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I could n't sleep that night . I had terrible dreams about facing Vernon in the morning . How could I have been so foolish as to actually assault his house ? I wished I had taken the pounding right then , when I was in hot blood and not trembling with fear . I woke at 2 A.M. and threw up in the toilet , then went into the dry heaves . I lay in bed , my head under the pillow . I prayed an asteroid would crash into our neighborhood so I would n't have to see the sunrise . <p> At around five o'clock I fell asleep . Later I heard wind rattle the roof , then a loud knocking sound like a door slamming repeatedly on a doorjamb . When I looked out my window screen I could see fog on the street and a maroon convertible with whitewall tires parked in front of the Dunlops ' house . An olive-skinned man with patent leather hair parted down the middle , wearing a clip-on bow tie and crinkling white shirt , sat in the passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheerio man Mr. Dunlop had run off from the parking lot in front of Costen 's Drug Store . Then I heard Benny 's voice on the Dunlops ' porch . <p> " See , you ca n't treat people like that . This is the United States , not Mussoliniville . So we need to walk out here and apologize to this guy and invite him back to the corner by the school . You 're good with that , are n't you ? " <p> There was a gap in the monologue . Then Benny 's voice resumed . " You 're not ? You 're gon na deny kids the right to enter Cheerio yo-yo contests ? You think all those soldiers died in the war for nothing ? That 's what you 're saying ? You some kind of Nazi pushing around little people ? Look at me when I 'm talking , here . " <p> Then Benny and Mr. Dunlop walked out to the convertible and talked to the Cheerio man . A moment later Benny got behind the wheel and the convertible disappeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep blue coolness of the room , with a sense of confidence in the world I had not felt since the day the war ended and Kate Smith 's voice sang " God Bless America " from every radio in the neighborhood . <p> When I woke , it was hot and bright outside , the wind touched with dust and the stench of melted tar . I told my mother of Benny Siegel 's visit to the Dunlops . <p> " You must have had a dream , Charlie . I was up early . I would have heard , " she said . <p> " No , it was Benny . His girlfriend was n't with him , but the Cheerio man was . " <p> She smiled wanly , her eyes full of pity . " You 've starved yourself and you break my heart . Nobody was out there , Charlie . Nobody " she said . <p> I went out to the curb . No one ever parked in front of the Dunlops ' house , and because the sewer drain was clogged , a patina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after each rain . I walked out in the street so I would n't be on the Dunlops ' property , my eyes searching along the seam between the asphalt and the gutter . But I could see no tire imprint in the gray film left over from the last rain . I knelt down and touched the dust with my fingers . <p> Vernon opened his front door and held it back on the spring . He was bare chested , a pair of sweat pants hanging below his navel . " Losing your marbles , frump ? " he asked . <p> By noon my skin was crawling with anxiety and fear . Worse , I felt an abiding shame that once again I had been betrayed by my own vanity and foolish trust in others . I did n't care anymore whether Vernon beat me up or not . In fact , I wanted to see myself injured . Through the kitchen window I could see him pounding dust out of a rug on the clothesline with a broken tennis racquet . I walked down the back steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . <p> " Your butt-kicking appointment is after lunch . I 'm busy right now . In the meantime , entertain yourself by giving a blowjob to a doorknob , " he replied . <p> " This wo n't take long , " I said . <p> He turned around , exasperated . I hit him , hard , on the corner of the mouth , with a right cross that Nick Hauser would have been proud of . It broke Vernon 's lip against his teeth , whipping his face sideways , causing him to drop the racquet . He stared at me in disbelief , a string of spittle and blood on his cheek . Before he could raise his hands , I hit him again , this time square on the nose . I felt it flatten and blood fly under my knuckles , then I caught him in the eye and throat . I took one in the side of the head and felt another slide off my shoulder , but I was under his reach now and I got him again in the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with . <p> He stepped back from me , blood draining from his split lip , his teeth red , his face twitching with shock . Out of the corner of my eye , I saw his father appear on the back porch . <p> " Get in here , boy , before I whup your ass worse than it already is , " Mr. Dunlop said . <p> That afternoon Nick Hauser and I went to a baseball game at Buffalo Stadium . When I came home my mother told me I had received a long-distance telephone call . This was in an era when people only called long-distance to inform family members that a loved one had died . I called the operator and was soon connected to Sister Felicie . She told me she was back at Our Lady of the Lake , the college in San Antonio where she had trained to become a teacher . <p> " I appreciate what your friend has tried to do , but would you tell him everything is fine now , that he does n't need to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which friend ? " I asked . <p> " Mr. Siegel . He 's called the archdiocese twice . " I heard her laugh , then clear her throat . " Can you do that for me , Charlie ? " <p> But I never saw Benny or his girlfriend again . In late June I read in the newspaper that Benny had been at her cottage in Beverly Hills , reading the L. A. Times , when someone outside propped an M-I carbine across the fork of a tree and fired directly into Benny 's face , blowing one eye fifteen feet from his head . <p> Years later I would read a news story about his girlfriend , whose nickname was the Flamingo , and how she died by suicide in a snowbank in Austria . I sometimes wondered if in those last moments of her life she tried to return to that winter-time photograph of her and Benny building a snowman in west Montana . <p> Vernon Dunlop never bothered me again . In fact , I came to have a sad kind of respect for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vernon was killed at the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War . Nick Hauser and I became school-teachers . The era in which we grew up was a poem and Bugsy Siegel was a friend of mine . <p>
