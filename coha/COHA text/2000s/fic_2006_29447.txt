Chapter One Six minutes from now , one of us would be dead . That was our fate . None of us knew it was coming . " Ron , hold up ! " I called out , chasing after the middle-aged man in the navy-blue suit . As I ran , the smothering Florida heat glued my shirt to my chest . Ignoring me , Ron Boyle darted up the tarmac , passing Air Force One on our right and the eighteen cars of the motorcade that idled in a single-file line on our left . As deputy chief of staff , he was always in a rush . That 's what happens when you work for the most powerful man in the world . I do n't say that lightly . Our boss was the Commander in Chief . The President of the United States . And when he wanted something , it was my job to get it . Right now President Leland " The Lion " Manning wanted Boyle to stay calm . Some tasks were beyond even me . Picking up speed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to their assigned cars , Boyle blew past a shiny black Chevy Suburban packed with Secret Service agents and the ambulance that carried extra pints of the President 's blood . Earlier today , Boyle was supposed to have a fifteen-minute sit-down with the President on Air Force One . Because of my scheduling error , he was now down to a three-minute drive-by briefing sometime this afternoon . To say he wasannoyed would be like calling the Great Depression a bad day at the office . " Ron ! " I said again , putting a hand on his shoulder and trying to apologize . " Just wait . I wanted to- " He spun around wildly , slapping my hand out of the way . Thin and pointy-nosed with a thick mustache designed to offset both , Boyle had graying hair , olive skin , and striking brown eyes with a splash of light blue in each iris . As he leaned forward , his cat 's eyes glared down at me . " Do n't touch me again unless you 're shaking my hand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek . Gritting my teeth , I wiped it away with the back of my hand . Sure , the scheduling hiccup was my fault , but that 's still no reason t- " Now , what the hell 's so damn important , Wes , or is this another vital reminder that when we 're eating with the President , we need to give you our lunch orders at least an hour in advance ? " he added , loud enough so a few Secret Service agents turned . Any other twenty-three-year-old would 've taken a verbal swing . I kept my cool . That 's the job of the President 's aide ... a.k.a. the body person ... a.k.a. the buttboy . Get the President what he wants ; keep the machine humming . " Lemme make it up to you , " I said , mentally canceling my apology . If I wanted Boyle quiet-if we did n't want a scene for the press-I needed to up the ante . " What if I ... what if I squeezed you into the President 's limo right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttoning his suit jacket . " I thought you-No , that 's good . Great . Excellent . " He even painted on a tiny smile . Crisis averted . He thought all was forgiven . My memory 's way longer than that . As Boyle triumphantly turned toward the limo , I jotted down another mental note . Cocky bastard . On the way home , he 'd be riding in the back of the press van . Politically , I was n't just good . I was great . That 's not ego ; it 's the truth . You do n't apply for this job , you 're invited to interview . Every young political gunner in the White House would 've killed to clutch this close to the leader of the free world . From here , my predecessor had gone on to become the number two guy in the White House Press Office . His predecessor in the last White House took a job managing four thousand people at IBM . Seven months ago , despite my lack of connections , the President picked me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rhodes scholars . I could certainly handle a tantrum-throwing senior staffer . " Wes , let 's go ! " the Secret Service detail leader called out , waving us into the car as he slid into the front passenger seat , where he could see everything coming . Trailing Boyle and holding my leather shoulder bag out in front of me , I jumped into the back of the armored limo , where the President was dressed casually in a black windbreaker and jeans . I assumed Boyle would immediately start talking his ear off , but as he passed in front of the President , he was strangely silent . Hunched over as he headed for the back left seat , Boyle 's suit jacket sagged open , but he quickly pressed his hand over his own heart to keep it shut . I did n't realize until later what he was hiding . Or what I 'd just done by inviting him inside . Following behind him , I crouched toward one of the three fold-down seats that face the rear of the car . Mine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security reasons , the President always sat in the back right seat , with the First Lady sitting between him and Boyle . The jump seat directly across from the President-the hot seat-was already taken by Mike Calinoff , retired professional race car driver , four-time Winston Cup winner , and special guest for today 's event . No surprise . With only four months until the election , we were barely three points ahead in the polls . When the crowd was that fickle , only a fool entered the gladiator 's ring without a hidden weapon . " So she 's fast , even with the bulletproofing ? " the racing champ asked , admiring the midnight-blue interior of Cadillac One . " Greased lightning , " Manning answered as the First Lady rolled her eyes . Finally joining in , Boyle scootched forward in his seat and flipped open a manila folder . " Mr. President , if we could- ? " " Sorry-that 's all I can do , sir , " Chief of Staff Warren Albright interrupted as he hopped inside . Handing a folded-up newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across from the First Lady , and more important , diagonally across from Manning . Even in a six-person backseat , proximity mattered . Especially to Boyle , who was still turned toward the President , refusing to give up his opening . The President seized the newspaper and scrutinized the crossword puzzle he and Albright shared every day . It had been their tradition since the first days of the campaign-and the reason why Albright was always in that coveted seat diagonally across from the President . Albright started each puzzle , got as far as he could , then passed it to the President to cross the finishline . " Fifteen down 's wrong , " the President pointed out as I rested my bag on my lap . " Stifle . " Albright usually hated when Manning found a mistake . Today , as he noticed Boyle in the corner seat , he had something brand-new to be annoyed by . Everything okay ? I asked with a glance . Before Albright could answer , the driver rammed the gas , and my body jerked forward . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fired . Two of us would crumble to the floor , convulsing . One would n't get up . " Sir , if I could bend your ear for a second ? " Boyle interrupted , more insistently than before . " Ron , ca n't you just enjoy the ride ? " the First Lady teased , her short brown hair bobbing as we hit a divot in the road . Despite the sweet tone , I saw the glare in her leaf-green eyes . It was the same glare she used to give her students at Princeton . A former professor with a PhD in chemistry , Dr. First Lady was trained to be tough . And what Dr. First Lady wanted , Dr. FirstLady fought for . And got . " But , ma'am , it 'll just take- " Her brow furrowed so hard , her eyebrows kissed . " Ron . Enjoy the ride . " That 's where most people would 've stopped . Boyle pushed even harder , trying to hand the file directly to Manning . He 'd known the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A professional banker , as well as a collector of antique magic tricks , he later managed all of the Mannings ' money , a magic trick in itself . To this day , he was the only person on staff who was there when Manning married the First Lady . That alone gave him a free pass when the press discovered that Boyle 's father was a petty con man who 'd been convicted ( twice ) for insurance fraud . It was the same free pass he was using in the limo to test the First Lady 's authority . But even the best free passes eventually expire . Manning shook his head so subtly , only a trained eye could see it . First Lady , one ; Boyle , nothing . Closing the file folder , Boyle sank back and shot me the kind of look that would leave a bruise . Now it was my fault . As we neared our destination , Manning stared silently through the light green tint of his bulletproof window . " Y'ever hear what Kennedy said three hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best Massachusetts accent . " You know , last night would 've been a hell of a night to kill a President . " " Lee ! " the First Lady scolded . " See what I deal with ? " she added , fake laughing at Calinoff . The President took her hand and squeezed it , glancing my way . " Wes , did you bring the present I got for Mr. Calinoff ? " he asked . I dug through my leather briefcase-the bag of tricks-never taking my eyes off Manning 's face . He tossed a slight nod and scratched at his own wrist . Do n't give him the tie clip ... go for the big stuff . I 'd been his aide for over seven months . If I was doing my job right , we did n't have to talk to communicate . We were in a groove . I could n't help but smile . That was my last big , broad grin . In three minutes , the gunman 's third bullet would rip through my cheek , destroying so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth again . That 's the one , the President nodded at me . From my overpacked bag , which held everything a President would ever need , I pulled out a set of official presidential cuff links , which I handed to Mr. Calinoff , who was loving every split second in his folded-down , completely uncomfortable hotseat . " Those are real , y'know , " the President told him . " Do n't put ' em on eBay . " It was the same joke he used every time he gave a set away . We all still laughed . Even Boyle , who started scratching at his chest . There 's no better place to be than in on an inside joke with the President of the United States . And on July 4th in Daytona , Florida , when you 'd flown in to yell , " Gentlemen , start your engines ! " at the legendary Pepsi 400 NASCAR race , there was no better backseat in the world . Before Calinoff could offer a thank-you , the limo came to a stop . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycles with their sirens blaring . They were leapfrogging from the back of the motorcade to the front . Just like a funeral procession . " Do n't tell me they closed down the road , " the First Lady said . She hated it when they shut traffic for the motorcade . Those were the votes we 'd never get back . The car slowly chugged a few feet forward . " Sir , we 're about to enter the track , " the detail leader announced from the passenger seat . Outside , the concrete openness of the airport runway quickly gave way to rows and rows of high-end motor coaches . " Wait ... we 're going out on the track ? " Calinoff asked , suddenly excited . He shifted in his seat , trying to get a look outside . The President grinned . " Did you think we 'd just get a couple seats in front ? " The wheels bounced over a clanging metal plate that sounded like a loose manhole cover . Boyle scratched even more at his chest . A baritone rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , glancing up at the clear blue sky . " No , not thunder , " the President replied , putting his own fingertips against the bulletproof window as the stadium crowd of 200,000 surged to its feet with banners , flags , and arms waving . " Applause . " " Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States ! " the announcer bellowed through the P.A. system . A sharp right-hand turn tugged us all sideways as the limo turned onto the racetrack , the biggest , most perfectly paved highway I 'd ever seen in my life . " Nice roads you got here , " the President said to Calinoff , leaning back in the plush leather seat that was tailor-made to his body . All that was left was the big entrance . If we did n't nail that , the 200,000 ticket holders in the stadium , plus the ten million viewers watching from home , plus the seventy-five million fans who 're committed to NASCAR , would all go tell their friends and neighbors and cousins and strangers in the supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holy water . But that 's why we brought the motorcade . We did n't need eighteen cars . The runway in the Daytona Airport was actually adjacent to the racetrack . There were no red lights to run . No traffic to hold back . But to everyone watching ... Have you ever seen the President 's motorcade on a racetrack ? Instant American frenzy . I did n't care how close we were in the polls . One lap around and we 'd be picking out our seats for the inauguration . Across from me , Boyle was n't nearly as thrilled . With his arms crossed against his chest , he never stopped studying the President . " Got the stars out too , eh ? " Calinoff asked as we entered the final turn and he saw our welcoming committee , a small mob of NASCAR drivers all decked out in their multicolor , advertising-emblazoned jumpsuits . What his untrained eye did n't notice were the dozen or so " crew members " who were standing a bit more erect than the rest . Some had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And one was speaking into his own wrist . Secret Service . Like any other first-timer in the limo , Calinoff was practically licking the glass . " Mr. Calinoff , you 'll be getting out first , " I told him as we pulled into the pit stalls . Outside , the drivers were already angling for presidential position . In sixty seconds , they 'd be running for their lives . Calinoff leaned toward my door on the driver 's side , where all the NASCAR drivers were " That way , " I said . The door right next to him . " But the drivers are over there , " Calinoff objected . " Listen to the boy , " the President chimed in , gesturing toward the door by Calinoff . Years ago , when President Clinton came for a NASCAR race , members of the crowd booed . In 2004 , when President Bush arrived with legendary driver Bill Elliott in his motorcade , Elliott stepped out first and the crowd erupted . Even Presidents canuse an opening act . With a click and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button under the door handle which allowed him to open the armor-lined door from the outside . Within seconds , the door cracked open , twin switchblades of light and Florida heat sliced through the car , and Calinoff lowered one of his handmade cowboy boots onto the pavement . " And please welcome four-time Winston Cup winner ... Mike Caaaalinoff ! " the announcer shouted through the stadium . Cue crowd going wild . " Never forget , " the President whispered to his guest as Calinoff stepped outside to the 200,000 screaming fans . " That 's who we 're here to see . " " And now , " the announcer continued , " our grand marshal for today 's race-Florida 's own ... President Leeeee Maaaaanning ! " Just behind Calinoff , the President hopped out of the car , his right hand up in a wave , his left hand proudly patting the NASCAR logo on the chest of his windbreaker . He paused for a moment to wait for the First Lady . As always , you could read the lips on every fan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... There they are ... Then , as soon as the crowd had digested it , the flashbulbs hit . Mr. President , over here ! Mr. President ... ! He 'd barely moved three steps by the time Albright was behind him , followed by Boyle . ( Continues ... )
