This week GEORGE W. BUSH named his father 's Defense Secretary , DICK CHENEY , to head his vice-presidential selection team , upping speculation that General COLIN POWELL , Cheney 's partner during the Gulf War , might be approached . Some in Bushland feel only Cheney can persuade his old friend to take the post  --  but it will be tough . Not only has Powell had a long-standing disregard for the No. 2 job , but sources say he was particularly disturbed by Bush 's South Carolina campaign  --  his failure to take a position on the Confederate flag flying above the state capitol , and his stop at Bob Jones University . Both hit home for the Powell family . As a young soldier , Powell and his wife often drove through the state in the early ' 60s , when the Stars and Bars was raised in defiance of new civil rights laws . And Powell 's son Michael married a white woman  --  a practice well outside Bob Jones ' newly abandoned edict against interracial dating . Recently it has been Bush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN MCCAIN for his mea culpa over the South Carolina flag issue . <P>  --  By John F. Dickerson/Washington
