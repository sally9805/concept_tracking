<p> On Jan. 20 , 1989 , President Ronald Wilson Reagan pretended to move out of the Oval Office . He 'd actually packed up his things the day before , clearing the way for his successor , George Bush . But no one had photographed the historic moment , so on Inauguration Day he did it again - for the cameras . <p> He tapped his now-empty desk , on cue . He went to the door and gave the room a sentimental look . <p> " You know what I was thinking while all that went on ? " said Colin Powell , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs , who was there . " This was the conclusion of a big dramatic production ... and there , all alone against the backdrop of the Oval Office , was Ronald Reagan shooting his last take . " <p> Alas , for the person that was true . Mr. Reagan faded quickly after leaving office . Disease robbed him of the chance to be anything to the nation but a symbol of his better days . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineradicably changed the presidency , and presidential politics . He was the nation 's symbol-in-chief , not its chief legislator . He made many American voters feel their nation was both virtuous and governable , at a time when that was in doubt . <p> Will any president ever again give a State of the Union without that most Reaganesque of moments , the introduction of heroes from the balcony ? <p> The secret of Reagan 's political success was that he was " uncompromisingly unoriginal , " in the words of one observer . In the era of " Doonesbury , " the one comic strip he read every day was the old-style soap opera " Mary Worth . " <p> He believed in the old verities . Communism was not just mistaken . It was evil . Taxes were not just a burden . They were evil , too . <p> Opponents saw an aging actor who thought that oil slicks made air healthy , and wrote him off . They underestimated the power of sincere belief delivered simply , with a smile . <p> " I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed Edmund G. ( Pat ) Brown , the Democratic ex-governor of California , years after his 1966 loss to Reagan . <p> Modest origins <p> The man who would become the 40th president of the United States had extremely ordinary origins . <p> He was the second son of John and Nellie Reagan , born on Feb. 6 , 1911 , in Tampico , Ill . When the young " Dutch " was 9 , his shoe salesman father moved the family to nearby Dixon , in search of a better life . What the father found instead was a deepening addiction to alcohol . <p> " We did n't live on the wrong side of the tracks , but we lived so close to them we could hear the whistle real loud , " Reagan remembered later . <p> Dutch struggled to haul his troubled father in the door more than once . Perhaps in reaction , he became an active participant in youth programs at the local Disciples of Christ church . He was attracted to what was then called " practical Christianity , " a strain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider secular world . <p> In his Washington years he attended religious services infrequently . But even as president he would not write out mild epithets with full spelling . In his speech notecards , they were always " h - l , " and " d - n . " <p> He spent his youthful summers as a lifeguard on the banks of the Rock River . From 1927 to 1932 , he rescued 77 swimmers from the river 's swift current - though , if truth be told , not all 77 thought they needed rescuing . <p> At nearby Eureka College , Reagan developed into a dramatist and budding politico : A student strike he helped lead forced the college president from office . A quick study with stage presence , he moved easily into the new world of radio after graduation . <p> But he wanted more from life than announcing Minnesota Gopher football . On a trip to California he wangled a screen test at Warner Brothers . The camera emphasized his lean good looks and native geniality , and the young man from the Midwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " That 's my Dutch . That 's the way he is at home , " said his mother after seeing her son on screen for the first time . <p> In later years political opponents used the term " former actor " to try to denigrate Reagan as an intellectual lightweight . In truth , actor Reagan was intensely interested in public policy . His constant chatter about issues bored his first wife , Jane Wyman , and helped lead to their divorce . <p> Early on , a fan of FDR <p> As a young man he had been an ardent defender of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal . As late as 1950 he campaigned for the liberal Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas in her losing US Senate race against Richard Nixon . <p> But the influence of his conservative older brother , Neil , plus Hollywood politics , pushed him toward the right . As president of the Screen Actors Guild he testified before the House Un- American Activities Committee on communist infiltration of the film industry . <p> By 1960 , Reagan was Republican enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire a long-blacklisted writer , Dalton Trumbo . " The American communist is in truth a member of a ' Russian American Bund ' owing his first allegiance to a foreign power , " Reagan wrote Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner . <p> In 1966 , Reagan was a self-proclaimed " novice amateur " in politics . But he was also on his way to becoming governor of California . Once in office , he cut taxes , or tried to : Welfare costs forced him to actually raise revenues by $ 1 billion . He stood up to Berkeley campus protesters with the blunt slogan , " observe the rules or get out . " <p> He won a second term in 1970 and cut state welfare rolls by 300,000 . A novice amateur no more , he could feel that his qualities - a genial toughness , a sunny outlook , a belief in simple , bold strokes - struck a deep chord with voters . Gerald Ford underestimated him , as Pat Brown had , and Mr. Ford almost lost the 1976 GOP presidential nomination to a Reagan insurgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in Reagan 's hands . <p> The Reagan Revolution <p> Today it is hard to remember the force with which the Reagan Revolution took Washington . Within the span of a few weeks , the new president pushed through legislative changes that were to remain perhaps the defining domestic accomplishments of his administration . Taxes were cut 25 percent . Defense spending was boosted by half . <p> Reagan 's economic legacy remains hotly debated today . To some , he was the father of soaring deficits - nondefense spending largely escaped his knife - and emcee of an era of indifference to the poor . Ketchup was declared a vegetable , for school lunch purposes . But his proponents insist that it was Reagan 's tax cuts and deregulation policies that led to the long boom of the last years of the 20th century - tarnished only by a shallow recession that coincided the Persian Gulf War . <p> Sure - the nation ran deficits almost as far as the eye could see , to paraphrase Reagan-era budget director David Stockman . But that red ink was caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Today there are more pieces of the Berlin Wall in US museums than in Berlin . <p> Anachronistic views <p> Ronald Reagan 's views about the Soviet Union were an anachronism , in the sense that Winston Churchill 's Victorian combativeness was an anachronism when he became prime minister of a demoralized England in 1940 . <p> Reagan did not see the Kremlin as a bureaucratic regime that happened to be Communist . He saw it as an evil empire - and one whose hidden weaknesses would cause it eventually to collapse . <p> He thought that the Strategic Defense Initiative - " star wars " - would hasten the Soviet Union 's day of internal reckoning . <p> Few scientists outside the military believed missile defense possible , and Reagan 's musings on the subject lent themselves to caricature . Yet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried doggedly to get the US to stop the expensive project . <p> Reagan refused . Eventually , he and Mr. Gorbachev agreed on landmark arms treaties , including the first pact to reduce , instead of cap , superpower nuclear arsenals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . Controversy over the Iran-contra affair swallowed up much of his second term . Though a congressional investigation never produced evidence that Reagan directed secret funds from Iran arms to Nicaraguan rebels , it produced a portrait of a president with little knowledge of or control over his subordinates ' actions . <p> Congress 's final report concluded that Reagan had failed to " take care that the laws be faithfully executed . " <p> As a campaigner , Reagan redefined the nature of running for president . Optimism , carefully controlled imagery , and poll-tested themes ousted incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980 and smashed Walter Mondale in 1984 . <p> Living the dream <p> As an administrator , he was not known for attention to detail . Whenever possible he raced out of the office at 5 p.m. , headed for the White House residence and his beloved wife , Nancy . <p> He was a believer in family values whose own children rebelled against what they perceived as his inattention . <p> He was a Democrat who became a Republican , a poor boy who became rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a union president and a spokesman for business . He was shot , and lived . Later he lived , and , diagnosed with Alzheimer 's , remembered nothing . <p> Jeanne Kirkpatrick , his national security adviser , once summed him up like this : " Ronald Wilson Reagan , 40th president of the United States , believed the American dream because he has lived it .
