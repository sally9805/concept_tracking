Got an embarrassing health problem-from bad breath to gas and beyond ? Here 's why you must alert your M.D. by janet bailey // Call it the " ick " factor : Some unsavory health problems just make you want to hide . Even the mere thought of talking to your doctor about things like incontinence or bad breath can understandably make you cringe . But you should speak up , because though these troubles are usually harmless , occasionally they signal something serious . So read on-and get the care you need . EMBARRASSING PROBLEM #1 Chronic bad breath Fredericka , 45 , has been concerned about her breath for years . But she really knew she had a problem when she began working as a teacher 's aide with 5- to 7-year-olds . " Children are outspoken , " she says . " They go , Ooh , gross , your breath stinks . ' So now I 'm self-conscious with adults too . " The usual suspects : Breath mints can actually lead to bad breath , because most contain sugar ( which odor-causing bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay , which may also sour your breath . And the alcohol in breath mints dries out your mouth ( so that saliva ca n't wash bacteria away ) . A better solution : thorough brushing and flossing . Spend at least three minutes cleaning your teeth twice a day-or every time you eat , as Fredericka now tries to do . Bacteria and food also tend to lodge on the tongue toward the back of the mouth , so brush your tongue or use a tongue scraper ( a loop-shaped device sold at drugstores ) after brushing your teeth . Also key : Eat breakfast ( even if it 's just a piece of fruit ) . Saliva flow stops at night , leading to morning breath . So if you do n't eat in the a.m. , you wo n't stimulate your salivary glands , and 30 minutes after brushing , you 'll have morning breath again . Less likely cause : Advanced gum disease can also trigger bad breath , and affects about 5 percent of women under 40 . Your dentist can help control ( and prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gums at least twice a year . If the problem is bad enough , you may need to have periodontal surgery . EMBARRASSING PROBLEM #2 Excessive facial hair A little peach fuzz is one thing , but for Leslie , 35 , who noticed her first chin hair in her mid-20s , " It seemed like the more I plucked , the more hair I got , " she says . " I was mortified . " The usual suspects : Some women produce higher-than-normal levels of androgens ( male hormones ) , or inherit a high sensitivity to normal levels of them , either of which can lead to excess facial hair . ( The latter is likely the case with Leslie , her doctor believes . ) Up to one in three women of Mediterranean descent may have this sensitivity . The growth can often be controlled by taking birth control pills plus spironolactone , an androgen-blocking drug . It 's also possible that polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) could be the cause . This condition may slow egg development , and raises the levels of androgens circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of women of childbearing age ; an endocrinologist can diagnose it via blood tests , and taking the Pill plus spironolactone often keeps symptoms in check . If you want to go off the Pill to get pregnant , your doctor may temporarily prescribe a drug to increase your sensitivity to insulin ( since PCOS-related problems include insulin resistance ) and to regulate hormone levels . If the Pill does n't help ( or you decide not to take it ) , and if bleaching , plucking , or waxing is not effective , see a dermatologist . Laser treatment can remove hair and slow new growth for at least three months . Sessions are briefer and less painful than electrolysis . ( The laser method got Leslie 's chin hair under control . ) An even newer treatment is eflornithine ( Vaniqa ) , a topical prescription cream . It 's been shown to remove facial hair within two months of daily use , and the effect lasts for up to eight weeks after you stop using the drug . Less likely cause : In rare cases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or adrenal gland . They 're nearly always benign and can be surgically removed . EMBARRASSING PROBLEM #3 Hair loss As hard as it is for guys to lose their hair , when it happens to women , it can be just devastating . The usual suspects : Losing some hair ( 50 to 100 strands a day ) is normal . After pregnancy , you may seem to lose more locks , because hormonal changes tend to synchronize hair growth , so strands tend to fall out at the same time . It 's nearly always temporary , so hang in there for six months to a year , until your regular shedding cycle resumes . Prolonged stress , iron deficiency , low-protein crash dieting , and some medications ( e.g. , antidepressants ) can also cause temporary thinning or loss of hair . Female-pattern baldness ( hair gets thinner but does n't actually disappear completely ) is longer lasting . It 's thought to be hereditary and occurs in 10 to 20 percent of women , most often after menopause . Applying the prescription solution minoxidil to the scalp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hair grow in up to one-quarter of cases . Another possible cause of hair-shedding : hypothyroidism , a condition in which your thyroid gland does n't produce enough thyroid hormone . This gland regulates metabolism , " which affects hair growth , among many other functions . The disorder affects as many as 15 percent of Americans and is more common in women . Angela , 30 , noticed her hair getting thinner a year ago . She read an article about hypothyroidism and asked her gynecologist for the simple blood test . Sure enough , her thyroid levels were unusually low . Angela is about to start taking synthetic thyroid hormone pills for treatment . Less likely cause : About 2 percent of U.S. women in all age groups suffer from alopecia areata . In these cases , white blood cells attack hair follicles , leading to patchy or total hair loss . It 's not dangerous , and sometimes the hair regrows spontaneously months or years later . Monthly cortisone injections to the skin of the scalp , or daily topical treatments ( typically anthralin , or minoxidil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . EMBARRASSING PROBLEM #4 Burping Outside of , say , your typical adolescent boy , there are n't many people who find a belchfest entertaining . The usual suspects : The most common cause is downing your food in a hurry . " If you eat too fast , you swallow air as you chew ; that creates bubbles in the stomach , and burping releases them , " explains Cynthia Yoshida , M.D. , author of No More Digestive Problems . If your burping is accompanied by heartburn ( or if you have heartburn without burping ) , avoid acidic , spicy , or fatty foods-such as pizza-which increase stomach acid . Also , do n't lie down right after eating , and when you do go to bed , pile your pillows up at least six inches high ; this helps prevent acid from moving up your esophagus . For times when traditional antacids do n't help , try stronger acid-blocking drugs , such as Pepcid and Tagamet . Less likely causes : If you have heart-burn twice a week or more ( with or without burping ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Translation : Your esophageal valve does n't close properly and lets stomach acid back up toward your throat and mouth . About 3 to 7 percent of Americans have GERD . One of them is Margaret Herring , 35 , of Akron , Ohio . " I burped all day long , " she says . Drugs called proton pump inhibitors help ( as they did for Herring ) by blocking the release of stomach acid , while still allowing you to digest food . Frequent burping without heartburn-or just feeling a strong need to burp-three or four times a day can signal a peptic ulcer . It 's now thought that most of these are caused by infection with h. pylori bacteria ; treatment typically includes antibiotics to kill the bacteria and proton pump inhibitors to block acid and heal the ulcer . : EMBARRASSING PROBLEM #5 Incontinence If you " leak " urine when you cough or sneeze-or you ca n't make it to the loo before it 's too late-you 're suffering from incontinence . Take Martha Limberick of Fredericksburg , Virginia . The 28-year-old make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My husband was understanding , but it was still awful , " she says . The usual suspects : For Limberick , the culprit was cola ; she downed lots of it . " The amount of liquid you drink can trigger incontinence , and caffeine can worsen the condition , " says Geoffrey Cundiff , M.D. , chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medicine Center . Indeed , chugging coffee , tea , or cola not only gives your body more fluid to expel , but the caffeine also stimulates your kidneys , making it harder for you to resist the urge to pee . A urologist suggested that Limberick cut back on the cola , so she began limiting herself to four cans daily , and none after 7 p.m . That was enough to stop the nighttime accidents , and reduce the daytime trips too . Perhaps one of the most common causes of incontinence in women is childbearing . In a Tel Aviv University study , 12 percent of women had urinary incontinence after giving birth vaginally , which can weaken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can often help . To do them , contract your sphincter muscles ( the ones you use to stop urinating ) and hold for ten seconds , then relax for ten seconds . Do this ten times , three times a day . If you leak urine and also have pain while peeing , you may have a urinary tract infection ( UTI ) , a condition that affects 10 to 20 percent of women one or more times a year . UTIs are treatable with antibiotics , and drinking a glass of fruit juice each day ( berry ones work best ) can help prevent recurrence . Less likely causes : If your symptoms also include excruciating pain in your side , lower back , or pubic area , you may have a kidney stone . These " stones " are actually hard deposits that form when excess minerals crystallize inside a kidney , and they occur in less than 1 percent of women younger than 45 . Small ones are expelled in the urine after a few days even without treatment ; larger ones typically require a doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early symptoms of multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Of the approximately 400,000 Americans with MS , two-thirds are women . Most MS sufferers live a full life span , and early diagnosis and treatment with new drugs can often slow or stop progression of the disease . EMBARRASSING PROBLEM #6 Passing gas For Leah , 38 , excess gas has taken its toll in-of all places-the bedroom . " There have been nights when no matter how loving I felt toward my husband , I was afraid to get into bed , " she says . " During sex , gas definitely does n't create a romantic mood . " The usual suspects : Certain foods are usually to blame-particularly beans , broccoli , and cabbage , which are high in the chemicals that your intestinal bacteria convert into gas . So , while we all know the benefits of a high-fiber diet , you need to up your roughage intake gradually . How ? Add three or four grams of fiber per day ( some sources : three-fourths cup of broccoli , one teaspoon of Metamucil , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount by another three grams each week until you 're up to 25 or 30 grams daily . You can also take Beano ( available at drugstores ) with fiber-rich foods ; it breaks down gasproducing nutrients so they 're more digestible . And cut back on soft drinks sweetened with sorbitol and fructose ; the body converts them into gas . If you have gas after drinking milk or eating yogurt or ice cream , you may be **26;1288;TOOLONG you are deficient in the enzyme lactase , which is needed to digest lactose , a sugar found in dairy products . An estimated 30 million to 50 million Americans have this condition . It is n't dangerous , and your doctor can diagnose it with a breath test . If you do n't want to give up milk products , you can find lactose-reduced items at most supermarkets , or take over-the-counter lactase drops or tablets with meals . Less likely cause : Another possible culprit for excessive gas is celiac disease . If you have this disorder , which runs in families and is found in one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protein found in wheat , rye , and barley ) causes inflammation in the lining of your small intestine . This results in decreased absorption of nutrients , which in some people causes bad gas . Leah 's doctor suspects that celiac disease is causing her gas problem , since it seems linked to her bread consumption . He gave her a referral to a specialist for celiac testing , in which an internist or gastroenterologist performs a blood test and takes a biopsy of the small intestine using a thin tube ( called an endoscope ) while you 're under sedation . A gluten-free diet is the only cure ; it usually heals the intestinal lining within six months , but must be followed for a lifetime . Sidebar Suddenly losing hair ?
