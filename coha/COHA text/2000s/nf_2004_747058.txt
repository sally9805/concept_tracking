As LINDA NOCHLIN HOPED when she wrote her pathbreaking essay , " Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists ? " in 1971 , the impact of feminism on the histories of art written during the ensuing decades has been enormous . This is amply demonstrated by the ever-expanding list of new publications within all areas of the discipline . Recent studies , appearing as articles , anthologized essays , book-length texts , and now on the Web , reveal both traditional and innovative strategies for assessing how concepts of gender difference have shaped both the production and interpretation of visual art. ( n1 ) <p> Some feminist scholars continue to employ traditional biographic approaches to facilitate the rediscovery and recuperation of " lost " or underestimated women artists . These methodologies reiterate early feminist efforts to reshape the dominant canon of " great artists " by establishing evidence that a wide spectrum of participant artists , including women , have contributed to the creation of many kinds of art at many levels . Restoring women artists ' professional identities and their works to the historical record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intervention in the field of feminist art history can be built . <p> Another established methodology that feminist art historians have applied to forward both traditional and new goals is iconographic analysis , the study of traditional symbolic references . By developing inventive gender-sensitive readings of the dominant iconographic codes of representation typical of specific historical moments , feminist scholars have teased out alternative meanings that register the impact of gendered assumptions on established symbolic meanings . In both these art historical practices , feminists have reclaimed the most conventional tools of the discipline-biographical research , formal analysis , and iconographic interpretation-to enhance appreciation for women 's contributions , to confront masculinist expectations about which artists and works rate inclusion in canonical histories , and to challenge conventional readings of established " masterpieces . " <p> However , as Nochlin was quick to point out in 1971 , accepting that " art is not a free , autonomous activity " practiced by isolated individuals and vaguely influenced by " social forces " ( n2 ) suggests that feminist scholars must go further than biographic or iconographic recuperation to challenge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has encouraged feminist scholars to investigate how gendered biases have shaped not only the institutional structures that influence women artists ' opportunities ( economic options , choices of material , professional allegiances , exhibition possibilities , and so forth ) but also past scholarly analyses of these processes ( or their absence ) . This strategy drew its focus from the same groundings in Marxist theory ' that stimulated other aspects of the " new " social histories of art coming to the fore in the 1970s , although also asserting the need for a gender-oriented corrective to scholarship that still frequently ignored or misrepresented women artists ' complex social positioning and historical agency . <p> Thus within feminist art history of the past thirty years , we find a growing insistence that all art historical narratives be rethought from the standpoint of how gender operates in shaping culture . This expansion of the parameters of feminist analysis in art history has posed significant challenges to conventional boundaries associated with the field . One early aspect of this expansionist strategy was resistance to the binary division between " fine art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes traditionally associated with women 's domestic work , such as needlework and quiltmaking , were significant forms of artistic expression . These media were often devalued in comparison to high art , yet they were uniquely accessible to women for the expression of aesthetic interests at times when fine art training was denied them . <p> In the 1980s and 1990s , feminist art historians also began to explore models of research and analysis drawn from the wider perspective of cultural and visual studies theory . They argued that the fine arts constitute only one of many visual sign systems within any culture and that gendered assumptions , so deeply embedded in the varied social contexts that frame artistic production ( such as advertising , cinema , or religious values ) , shape every aspect of art 's creation and reception . Such research moves beyond the basics of biography , visual analysis , material structure , and iconography to query the gendered shaping of art education ; personal relationships and professional allegiances among artists ; exhibition and sales opportunities ; the relationships between art , advertising , comics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the typical vocabularies of recognition ( or condescension ) found in critical reviews . Taken further , this approach led to a still deeper interrogation of aesthetic values associated with beauty or virility and period styles , such as Impressionism or Abstract Expressionism , as similarly based in and identified with socially constructed , gendered concepts . <p> Other strands of cultural studies-oriented inquiry have explored the relation of fine art to discourses of racialized , ethnic , and/or sexual difference , and the significance of multicultural and/or multinational readings of art production that reject previous canonical assumptions about national and regional essentialisms . Finally , some recent feminist art history has turned to postmodernist intellectual theories and psychoanalysis to explore issues such as the discursive workings of social power , the instability of individual psychic formations , and the performativity of all gendered identities . <p> To effectively exemplify such a significant outpouring of feminist work in the handful of examples allotted to one review essay would be impossible . In the process of narrowing my parameters , I first limited the selection to U.S. art ( my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the years between 1870 and the mid-twentieth century . However , even within these limits , feminist publications have become so numerous and exhibit such a range of thematic and theoretical approaches that their variety is still difficult to represent effectively in only six examples . Therefore this review brings together a " sampler " of six books and anthologies with the aim of highlighting two major approaches , which I am calling " recuperative strategies " and " cultural studies , " and illustrating established as well as new possibilities within each type of scholarship . <p> RECUPERATIVE STRATEGIES <p> The retelling of art 's histories to include women participants and the recuperation of women artists ' biographies and works have laid the necessary groundwork for other types of feminist art historical scholarship . But the intellectual basis of such monographic studies has also been challenged from several directions . Biographical studies have been accused of overreliance on life details to " explain " women 's works and overemphasis on the influence of contemporary male artists on women 's ideas . Women awarded the attention of monographic studies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other women 's works . Postmodernist assertions that authorship is irrelevant to textual interpretation and that the concepts of a " unified self " and coherent biographical narrative are both fictive constructions have also seriously problematized the work of recuperative feminist art historians . <p> Many feminist scholars questioned the eruption of these theories in Western intellectual thought just at the moment when women and people of color began to " speak " in their own voices . In the introduction to New Feminist Criticism , a 1994 anthology , the editors ( Joanna Frueh , Cassandra Langer , and Arlene Raven ) suggest that psychoanalytic theory and deconstruction are problematic tools for feminist scholars because they suppress the notion of an " authentic " self that is central to recent art produced by women , especially self-identified feminist artists. ( n3 ) In contrast , several essays in Singular Women : Writing the Artist ( 2003 ) argue for more innovative conceptual practices for constructing feminist art history through biography . Melanie Herzog , for example , suggests that the monograph form need not be strictly focused on singular biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other artists , communities , and intellectual and political traditions . Karen A. Bearor takes a still more radical stance , suggesting that writers of feminist art biographies need to rethink both " realist " conventions of narrative and claims to authorial objectivity , thereby reframing biographical history in more complexly theorized , multivoiced , and overlayered processes. ( n4 ) <p> Feminist art historians continue to struggle with the disjuncture between the importance of self-defined subjectivity ( especially for marginalized communities ) and the power of theoretical discourses that provide insights into the social construction of gender but insist on the fragmentation and relativity of both identity and interpretive practices . Undoing the binary oppositions underlying this dilemma has proved to be a difficult challenge that is not yet resolved . <p> The first three works discussed in this review illustrate several of these divergent strategies for recuperating the lives and works of women artists . Independent Spirits : Women Painters of the American West , 1890-1945 , is an anthology of essays , focused on distinct state or regional areas , which was first published as an exhibition catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians and museum curators ; each essay presents art by a wide spectrum of professional women artists who worked beyond the geographical dominance of urban art centers in the early twentieth century . Independent Spirits exemplifies basic feminist efforts to shift the scope of biographical research beyond the simple reclamation of lost talent . As editor Patricia Trenton perceptively states in the introduction , these essays are intended " to explore the shifting mechanisms of privilege and exclusion , as women evolved ... to a more integrated participation in the arts " ( ix ) . Her emphasis on power and institutional privilege echoes Nochlin 's insistence that it was not genius or its lack that muted women 's recognition as artists , but rather gender-biased institutional constraints on education , exhibition opportunities , and communal intellectual life that limited both their accomplishments and historical memory of their achievements . Trenton 's reference to privilege and exclusion also evokes Marxist and postmodernist theorizing about class and institutionalized social differences , but these essays apply such concepts in narratives characterized by direct language and explicitly historicized individual experience . However , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept , in multiple ways . <p> The essays in Independent Spirits focus on nine differing regional areas of the West-northern and southern California , the Northwest , Arizona , New Mexico , Texas , the Rocky Mountain region , and the Great Plains  --  and each emphasizes the diversity within these regional geographies . Diversity is also foregrounded via the authors ' reiteration that despite dominant interests in modernism and regionalism during the early twentieth century , American art was not defined by monolithic ideals , a point effectively reinforced by the brilliantly colored illustrations that fill the text . The vitality of each region 's women artists ( far too many to enumerate ) and the imaginative complexity of their works are illuminated by biographical anecdotes combined with discussions of the style and iconography of specific images . These range from primitivizing self-taught pictures to sophisticated self-portraits and dreamlike surrealist abstractions , and from naturalistic mountain and desert landscapes and industrial scenes to modernist still life paintings . Moreover , each author connects women 's art production to the issues that haunted all women professionals in the early twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting gendered expectations about professional careerism for women , and constraints on their choices of subjects and thematic expression , depending on what was considered " suitable " for women artists in particular contexts . It is suggestive that few of the works illustrated portray either traditional " feminine " experience or masculinized Western myths . As Erika Doss points out , " Few Western women artists ... chose subjects or styles that perpetuated the nostalgic frontier image of the Wild West that still pervades our historical consciousness .... Eschewing images of progress and the sublime , women artists of the West imagined their lives and the Western landscape on their own terms " ( 240 ) . <p> Despite their obvious prioritizing of diversity in regard to artists ' lifestyles and aesthetic choices , the authors discuss works by only a few women of color ( African American and Native American ) , although several writers did comment on the difficulty of finding substantive information on artists who were not white . Trenton sees this absence as an important reflection of the oppressive results of the United States ' racialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes " there were few recognized women painters among some racial and ethnic groups .... Both cultural and economic factors seem to have prevented women 's involvement with painting as a profession ... although only a modicum of research has been done " ( 277 n8 ) . Trenton also calls for an increased commitment to such research in art historical studies . There is also little to no discussion in Independent Spirits of the possibility that women who never married might have been lesbians . In part this reticence may reflect scholars ' deference to the homophobic biases of artists ' heirs ; however , several authors use unnecessary discretion in referring to women artists ' life partners as " friends " and " companions , " and there is no citation for " lesbian " in the index . Nevertheless , Independent Spirits demonstrates new feminist possibilities for integrating biography ( albeit in very traditional narratives ) with thoughtful analyses of women 's diverse options and shared obstacles . <p> The number of monographs on women painters or sculptors who worked before the 1950s is gradually expanding beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing substantive monographs focused on one individual offers another challenge to feminist art historians who wish to move beyond traditional narratives of personal struggles and successes . Melanie Herzog 's outstanding 2000 monograph , Elizabeth Catlett : An American Artist in Mexico , celebrating the work and life of the African American artist , sets a high standard for future studies through its interweaving of multiple facets of the artist 's life and interests , its resistance to a simplified narrative structure , and its self-conscious articulation of the author 's and artist 's subjective positionings . Catlett ( b. 1915 ) is a U.S.-born printmaker and sculptor who as of 2004 is still working . Having lived in Mexico since the 1940s , she identifies herself as both an African American and a Mexican artist . The scope of her works has similarly focused on both women 's experience and social justice ideals . The overall flow of Herzog 's narrative traces Catlett 's career from her childhood in Washington , D.C. , through her graduate studies in sculpture in the 1930s at the University of Iowa ( where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her involvement with Harlem Renaissance artists in New York City , her move to Mexico in 1946 , her contributions to the Taller de Grafica Popular ( a radical printmaking workshop ) , and her fifty-year career in Mexico as an esteemed artist and teacher . Blacklisted by the Central Intelligence Agency for her leftist views during the 1950s , Catlett was not allowed to travel freely to the United States for several decades . <p> Herzog 's study combines interview and document-based biographical details with cogent analyses of the political , social , and aesthetic aspects of Catlett 's life and works . She adopts bell hooks 's use of the term " visual politics " to characterize the resistant visual art practices of artists such as Catlett , who challenge artworld tendencies to devalue , marginalize , and exclude individuals based on race , gender , and class ( 4 ) . Herzog emphasizes the importance of a socially conscious visual politics to Catlett 's work and she tracks its development and elaboration throughout her career . The story becomes complicated as Catlett 's " essential identity as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , marriage to Mexican artist Francisco Mora , and engagement with Mexican radical politics through her work at the Taller de Grafica Popular and the National Fine Arts School of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico ( 119 ) . Herzog argues that Catlett was forced to develop not just the doubled consciousness defined by W.E.B . Dubois but a multiple consciousness incorporating the layered social identities of her artistic and political life in Mexico . <p> Herzog refers frequently to feminist issues as she interweaves discussion of Catlett 's life experiences with analysis of her subject choices and modes of representation . This strategy is exemplified in her discussion of Catlett 's lifetime commitment to creating positive images of the black female body in both linoleum-cut prints and sculptures . Herzog contrasts Catlett 's sculptures of proud as well as realistically tired and aging figures to the absence of black female nudes in most African American art . An early work titled Tired ( 1946 , fig. 1 ) , created in terracotta , exemplifies her sensitivity to these issues . Herzog cites black art historian Judith Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a contested site for visual representation because of its problematic echoes of slavery , objectification , colonizing sensualization , and notions of " aesthetic unworthiness " ( 121 ) . By contrast , Herzog suggests that " Catlett 's nudes ... are a pioneering reclamation of the female body ... their layered references to multiple art traditions complicate their functions as signifiers of self-definition and self-assertion " ( 122 ) . Herzog points out that Catlett does not use models but says that she feels the body from within , while also integrating a variety of European , African , and Mexican concepts of figurative representation . <p> Discussion of the tensions between Catlett 's Mexican and African American identities , as expressed through her comments as well as her linoleum cut prints and sculptures , also allows Herzog to move beyond simple biographical narrative . During her first years in Mexico , Catlett created numerous prints that focused on Mexico 's political history and indigenous culture . After 1960 , drawing on ideas promoted by the U.S. Civil Rights and Black Power movements , she turned to images that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linocuts , screenprints , and sculptures in wood and stone . In this context , Herzog again complicates her analysis with sensitive discussions of the overlap between Catlett 's interest in depicting politicized subjects and her curiosity about new aesthetic strategies . She traces the development of Catlett 's aesthetic interests and discusses the politics surrounding her shows in the United States at the time when her citizenship had been revoked because of her alleged Communist connections . <p> Herzog treats Catlett 's complex career from a perspective that does not directly articulate feminist concerns but continually draws on feminist perspectives to assess the artist 's work and ideas . Her approach transcends conventional , if feminist-inspired , biocritical analysis by presenting the artist as continually negotiating the conflicting demands of her overlapping , socially constructed identities . Herzog 's monograph , filled with beautifully reproduced photographs of Catlett 's prints and sculptures , not only reintegrates an important African American artist into the larger cultural traditions of both the United States and Mexico but also asserts a new , more theoretically complex approach to recuperative biographical studies . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two recent essays addressing the idiosyncratic New York artist Florine Stettheimer ( 1871-1944 ) . Scholars Elizabeth Sussman and Barbara J. Bloemink curated a retrospective exhibition of her paintings , titled Florine Stettheimer : Manhattan Fantastica , which was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1995 ; each contributed an essay to the catalog . Stettheimer was a painter and theatrical set designer who was well known in modernist art and literary circles in New York City during the interwar decades . Her works included playfully witty images of avant garde social life and portraits of her mother , sisters , and literary , intellectual , and artist friends , all done in a brilliantly colored , delicately whimsical faux naif style . Stettheimer rarely exhibited her works and even her contemporaries were at times puzzled by her oblique references to current art , literature , commerce , patriotism , and politics . Thus , even though the unique sophistication of her style drew directly on her familiarity with the inventive freedoms of contemporary modernist art , she was rarely included in the canon of early-twentieth-century American modernist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two further interpretive possibilities for biographical recuperation taken by feminist art historians in the 1990s . Sussman begins her analysis with a detailed biographical overview of Stettheimer 's career that sets her creative production within the larger cultural context of interwar New York City . She situates the artist 's personal experience within the larger intersecting social geographies of modernist art in New York : Alfred Stieglitz 's gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue , the apartments of art collectors Mabel Dodge and Walter and Louise Arensberg , and Stettheimer 's own home , decorated in a lavishly elegant and distinctly nonmodernist style , which she shared with her mother and two sisters . Sussman discusses Stettheimer 's relation to other stylistically innovative artists of her circle , such as Miguel de Covarrubias , a widely admired Mexican caricaturist ; Marcel Duchamp ; and the photographer and novelist Carl Van Vechten . She also tracks the few public exhibitions of Stettheimer 's work , noting her reticence about exhibiting her paintings outside her own studio . Sussman points out that Stettheimer developed some of her most outrageously experimental works between 1929 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixties . These included a series of four paintings that depicted her idiosyncratic views of New York institutions : the Cathedrals of Broadway ( theater and film ) , Cathedrals of Wall Street ( money and politics ) , Cathedrals of Fifth Avenue ( shopping and society ) and Cathedrals of Art ( museums and society ) ( 1942 , fig. 2 ) . Each work was populated by wispy portrait figures and pointed symbolic references to contemporary celebrities and issues . She also designed an extraordinary modernist stage set made of colored cellophane for Four Saints in Three Acts , the opera created collaboratively by Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thompson , which was performed at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford , Connecticut , in 1934 . Her inventive contrast of transparent shimmering backdrops with all-white costumes earned rave reviews from critics . A few surviving photographs provide evidence of her daring and the event became a benchmark of American theatrical modernism . <p> Having detailed the interconnecting aesthetic and social relationships that both problematized and enhanced Stettheimer 's career , Sussman takes a self-consciously postmodernist stance by asking two historiographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , and why was it then " rediscovered " in the 1990s ? . Her answer to the first problem explores historical tensions within the artworld . Stettheimer 's work was largely ignored , she argues , first because its witty idiosyncrasies did not fit dominant tropes of modernist innovation , and later because an obsession with abstraction dominated narratives of what counted as modernist art . Neither of these points will surprise feminist readers , but they are important markers of institutional discrimination . Although Stettheimer 's family carefully distributed her works to major museums after her death , they were usually kept in storage because curators could not fit them into the familiar modernist canon . Sussman believes that three factors led to a reevaluation of Stettheimer 's art in the 1980s : gay liberation , the rise of Pop art , and the women 's movement . She notes that the artifice and whimsy of Stettheimer 's works , as well as the sexual ambiguities in many of her portraits , took on new appeal in the 1970s as an audience emerged that appreciated signifiers of overtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the performativity of gender , Sussman ends by suggesting that Stettheimer 's works " teased " the sexual identities of their subjects by suggesting a " kind of androgynous mobility . " This matched the newly chic 1980s fascination with gay identity and campy pleasure ( 56 ) . The commercial and critical success of Pop art also aided the revival of Stettheimer 's works , she argues , by relegitimating figurative painting ; and the feminist art movement , with its interest in resuscitating older artists ' reputations , emerged just in time to bring new attention to her outrageously inventive ideas . <p> Nochlin 's 1980 essay , " Roccoco Subversive " ( which was reprinted in the Manhattan Fantastica catalog ) , first drew connections between the artist 's " social acuity " and the " camp sensibilities " that it evoked . Nochlin based her argument on a critique of Susan Sontag 's 1964 essay on camp tastes , arguing that what Sontag posed as " private " issues of aesthetic pleasure should be seen in the 1980s as politicized and subversive of dominant cultural norms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another marker of the curators ' affirmation of a multilayered postmodernist relativism , because it encourages readers to compare Nochlin 's politicized interpretation to Sussman 's use of 1990s theories of gender performativity . <p> Barbara Bloemink 's essay also makes reference to recent theoretical developments by discussing Stettheimer 's works in relation to current cinema and media studies . Taking an ahistorical viewpoint , she positions Stettheimer 's works in a context of late-twentieth-century interests in opticality , perceptual mutability , and the experience of multiple moments of narrative contained in single images . Both Sussman and Bloemink examine elements in Stettheimer 's oeuvre via theorized concepts that were historically impossible for the artist herself to have considered . In this sense , both claim the postmodernist privilege of imaginatively interacting with an artist 's work without seeking any historical grounding for their speculative explorations . Drawing on issues of interest to late-twentieth-century scholars , both catalog essays seek to open up Stettheimer 's works to provocative postmodernist readings , and both assume a grounding in feminist theory rather than articulating it as a point of argument . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , seeking to reinstate women 's presence in canonical art history , have made use of a wide range of strategies , some based in traditional art historical tactics , some using theories of social construction to broaden the contexts within which women 's work can be interpreted , and some turning to postmodernist assertions of authorial freedom to construct wide-ranging interpretive possibilities not limited to historically grounded evidence . <p> ART HISTORY AND CULTURAL STUDIES <p> As discussed above , a second significant direction for feminists studying early-twentieth-century American art has focused on research that sets privileged fine art objects and their makers into a wider historical context , one that combines gender issues with cultural studies and an understanding of " fine " art as part of an expanded range of visual culture ( advertising , comics , cinema , television , video , and so forth ) . Art historians have often presented a background of contemporary social , cultural , and/or political history to contextualize works of art , and recent social histories of art have looked more closely at how relationships between art and contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of class and ignored or minimized gender as a central locus of social meanings ) . The turn to what is now called " cultural studies " is marked by still greater emphasis on the evaluation of art as a constituent part of social culture rather than an isolated expression of elite tastes . Embedding art production within a complex matrix of cultural practices , scholars have taken up wide-ranging projects that include interrogating the tensions of gender , intellectual play , and political power expressed in patronage relationships ; looking more closely at the connections between " high " art , commercial art , and mass cultural products ; exploring the links between art making and changing practices of tourism and colonialism ; and stirring new interest in the impact of both market forces and cultural discourses on the production and reception of art . Striving to blur rather than reinforce boundaries and to understand cultural objects and practices as constructed through multiply intersecting systems of creation , production , and reception , the work of art historians doing cultural studies has opened up new possibilities for feminist gender-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different approaches to the use of cultural studies methodologies in constructing art historical scholarship . The first explores a subject not previously discussed in art historical studies : the relationship between U.S. women 's changing philanthropic roles and their identities as art collectors , art patrons , and founders of fine art museums between 1830 and 1930 . Working through a series of traditionally focused , chronological narratives , this text manifests a cultural studies stance through its centralization of individuals and practices normally found only on the margins of art historical narratives . The second study deploys a cultural studies model more intentionally to show how images of women created by four popular artists working in New York City during the interwar decades can be better understood by situating them in relation to contemporary developments in urban geography , labor values , advertising , women 's fashion , and contested ideologies of gender difference and women 's appropriate social roles . The third study expands the project of feminist cultural history somewhat differently . Its author analyzes how the emergence of numerous successful women artists in the period between 1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art world 's primal structures , including education , exhibitions , marketing , collecting , and critical reviews . In this work , a cultural studies approach facilitates new understandings of American art production at the turn of the ( twentieth ) century as a complexly socialized and deeply gendered process . <p> In the first of these examples , Women 's Culture : American Philanthropy and Art , 1830-1930 , Kathleen McCarthy combines a recuperative biographical model with searching questions about the impact of gendered constructions of social identity on the funding , collecting , and institutional display of art . Rather than focusing on the artists themselves , McCarthy investigates the influence of a series of elite U.S. women who used advocacy , collecting , and philanthropy to contribute to the building of U.S. art institutions and the shaping of contemporary attitudes toward aesthetic value and cultural nationalism . <p> Beginning her chronological study in the antebellum period , McCarthy traces the shifting forms of women 's support for the visual arts into the mid-twentieth century . She challenges the prevailing myth that the world of " culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly in contrast to the obvious male domination of the business world . This view is mistaken , she argues ; documentary research shows that women had very limited roles in shaping early cultural institutions in the United States , even after the Civil War . Not until the late-nineteenth century did women begin to use their philanthropic activities in the arts as well as in social work and labor reform to forge professional roles for themselves outside the home , and it was only in the 1920s that they began to take on leadership roles . McCarthy tracks these historical changes in women 's professional support for various forms of visual art , focusing on individual collecting patterns and women 's roles in the establishment of schools , studios , and major fine art institutions ; she also considers the similarities and differences between women 's activities and those of their male peers . <p> McCarthy astutely demonstrates that women 's efforts took three distinct forms to forestall or elude masculine domination . First , they patronized artistic media and techniques seen as subordinate or not yet assimilated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ceramics production in the late-nineteenth century and radically modernist art in the early-twentieth century . These kinds of art were less expensive to collect than European masterpieces and were of less interest to male patrons , allowing women to demonstrate their increasing expertise while avoiding competition with more highly educated men . Second , as women developed stronger views about collecting and aesthetic issues , they frequently adopted assimilationist strategies to fit themselves into male-dominated art institutions . Combining independent taste with deferential behaviors , they were able to collect and donate art to major institutions in the 1890s even as the men leading these organizations " trivialized women 's contributions as artists , managers , and potential trustees " ( xv ) . By the 1910s , however , a third mode took over , as women began to use family wealth to assert the validity of their innovative tastes in art . In a relatively short time , they were able either to donate their personal collections to major institutions or to create new institutions of their own . Major collections of Impressionist art at the Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art at Yale , as well as the original collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum were each underwritten , McCarthy claims , by women 's new ability in the early-twentieth century to provide independent " matronage . " <p> McCarthy 's last three chapters center on a series of women who played significant roles between 1890 and 1930 , such as Isabella Stewart Gardner , Abby Aldrich Rockefeller , Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney , and Juliana Force . But even in these discussions , although she includes significant biographical details , McCarthy 's focus is instrumental , highlighting the strategies each woman employed to assert her vision for new institutional developments . Her biographical observations , however , are tellingly feminist in perspective . She characterizes Gardner , whose home , Fenway Court , is now the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Art in Boston , as delighting " in flaunting conventions , including the notion that men collect , while women display " ( 160 ) . Moreover , McCarthy notes , Gardner was seen as " repeatedly transgressing male terrain " through activities such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and climbing up scaffolding with an axe during the construction of her Boston mansion in 1898 to show workers how she wanted the ceiling beams textured ( 170 ) . <p> The very act of collecting major works of European art , from historical " masters " ( e.g. , Titian , Rembrandt , Vermeer ) to the Impressionists , was seen at the time as trumping male competitors . McCarthy explains how Gardner managed to construct an outstanding collection at a time when most women had neither the financial means nor the aggressive will to attempt this . Her goals were obviously enabled by her wealth ( her husband paid for household expenses , allowing her to use her own inheritance for independent purposes ) , although as market prices rose , she was less able to indulge her ambitious interests . She also used a deferential strategy effectively by working with a series of male advisors , the last of whom was the famous connoisseur , Bernard Berenson . Gardner 's eponymous museum was chartered in 1900 ; it had a small board of trustees , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . McCarthy views her accomplishments as evidence of her ability to manipulate contemporary gender expectations , following her own will while seemingly acquiescing to the guidance of male experts . <p> The contributions of women with more modest incomes and goals are also valuable elements in McCarthy 's cultural studies agenda . She discusses the impact of several women who facilitated the introduction of modernist art to the United States , including Mabel Dodge ( whose salon in the 1910s brought together early modernist artists ) and Katherine Dreier ( who cofounded the Socit Anonyme with Marcel Duchamp in 1920 ) . She then concludes by returning to the roles played by two wealthy women patrons who worked with women peers and assistants to create major modernist art institutions : Abby Aldrich Rockefeller , who cofounded the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1929 with Lillie Bliss and Mary Quinn Sullivan , and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney , who transformed her private collection into the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1930 with the assistance of Juliana Force , her brilliant assistant , who administered the collection and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case studies , McCarthy particularly highlights the ways in which each woman 's experiences were shaped not only by her birth family , personality , marital history , and intellectual networks , but also by contemporary changes in women 's social roles . She also illuminates a fascinatingly gendered contrast between the terms on which the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art were established . Rockefeller , under familial pressure , agreed to an institutional setup that gave the Museum of Modern Art a male president , a male director , and a predominantly male board of trustees . Whitney avoided a similar path but only by refusing to put any institutional board in place ; instead she used her own social connections to raise money by throwing elegant parties at her Long Island estate , while her assistant Force negotiated with artists , staged exhibitions , and encouraged collectors . This choice eventually proved unworkable . McCarthy also tellingly notes that despite their own desires for independence , her subjects ' actions were not primarily grounded in feminist ideals . Even as elite women gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting as gallery owners , museum directors , or trustees , they rarely sought to bring other women along with them . For example , Whitney , herself a successful sculptor as well as an art collector , was at first exceptionally supportive of women artists , but she grew less committed to this goal as she turned over control of the museum to Force , who did not share those sympathies . <p> McCarthy 's feminist cultural studies focus emerges through her attention to the intersections of wealth , marital roles , class status , and education that allowed these women to develop the expertise necessary for their ambitions . Despite their shared financial security , she argues , their options were repeatedly limited by their lowered status as women in a culture of patriarchally organized wealth . At the same time , they benefited from their familial status , because all the major institutions for the display of visual art in the United States were run almost exclusively by white , Protestant elites . Although a few other options existed for viewing art , such as the Educational Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early-twentieth century ) , McCarthy does not address cultural activities promoted by immigrants or by minority groups , either racial or religious ( xiii ) . Her empathetic and at times celebratory study centers on white elite women who broke through gendered cultural barriers to make ambitious contributions to the development of national art institutions . <p> Where McCarthy sets recuperative biography into an expanded context of cultural studies , Ellen Wiley Todd 's The " New Woman " Revised : Painting and Gender Politics on Fourteenth Street , published in 1993 , goes much further , so that her innovative interdisciplinary text has became a model for the expansion of U.S. feminist art history into cultural studies . Her research centered on images of women in the work of four artists ( Kenneth Hayes Miller , Reginald Marsh , Raphael Soyer , and Isabel Bishop ) , who all had studios in the area around Union Square in New York City during the 1930s . Miller , who was known for his advocacy of Renaissance-style drawing , taught at the Art Students ' League , where Marsh , Soyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained close to him as they went on to establish their professional reputations as realist painters . Todd argues that all four artists shared an almost obsessive interest in portraying the modern " new women " who worked , shopped , and socialized in their neighborhood , although each tended to portray a single type of female identity . Miller was fascinated by matronly maternal shoppers , Marsh by voluptuous women out on the streets , Soyer by young office and shop clerks tired from their jobs , and Bishop by working girls who shared lunch or chatted over ice cream . <p> Todd 's study has become an important example of cultural studies scholarship in art history because her probing discussions of each artist 's representational choices show that their ideas were inextricably intertwined with current changes in urban development , labor practices , and gender politics characteristic of the specific area of New York City in which they worked . In the introduction , she asserts that her study is grounded in several intellectual arenas : poststructuralism , Marxism , feminism , and gender theory . One significant concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise that art works can be read as cultural " texts " that must always be understood in relation to other texts and historicized experiences in continually expanding circles of reference . A second important focus is gender theory , with its insistence that gendered terms have socially constructed meanings that are always specific to particular historical moments ( xxxiii ) . Her third methodological strategy draws on the concept of the " discursive field , " allowing her to position art images within a larger matrix of contemporary cultural life that included exhibitions , critical reviews , the social spaces in which artists interacted , and the social structures that shaped their interests . Thus , using a cultural studies model , her intention is not merely to reinterpret certain paintings from a feminist perspective , but to construct a " demystifying practice " that would reposition each artist 's work and ideas within a complex historicized structure of institutions and ideologies ( xxxiv ) . <p> The book 's organization reiterates its grounding in cultural studies through the interweaving of chapters that focus on gender issues ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures , and sexuality in advertising ) , cultural history ( delineating the economic and social developments that shaped the Fourteenth Street area between 1900 and 1940 ) , and the interests and aesthetic concerns of each artist . The numerous illustrations support the diversity of Todd 's focus by bringing together paintings , photographs of Union Square , advertisements , suffrage cartoons , fashion drawings , magazine covers , and even a full-page chart laying out in excruciating detail the " Minimum Essentials in Operating a Household " ( 156 ) . Throughout , an encompassing feminist perspective provides the reader with details of working women 's lives that are illuminated or deflected in the artists ' images . We learn of changing standards of office demeanor , the exhaustion of long workdays , the threat and actuality of unemployment , and the support of female comradeship . <p> The warmth of women 's homosocial intimacy is particularly evident in the works of the only woman artist discussed , Bishop , who often sketched outdoors from life in the Union Square area or invited young women to pose in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple head studies of young girls smiling , putting on makeup , or straightening their hats , as well as scenes of young women in pairs , talking , eating ice cream cones , or reading letters or books together , as in Two Girls ( 1935 , fig. 3 ) . Todd discusses the aesthetic characteristics of Bishop 's works while also contextualizing them in relation to current attitudes to women 's labor and showing how gendered tensions inflected critical reviews ; one example cites a female critic who praised the artist 's delicacy and " superb draftsmanship , " whereas a male writer condemned the same works as revealing an " indistinct , nebulous manner . " Such contradictory critical opinion , Todd argues , was closely related to deeper gendered expectations in the culture at large . Todd 's innovative cultural studies approach to the works of all four artists affirms the possibility of constructing new kinds of feminist art history narratives that reveal the ways in which the production and reception of works of art is always deeply embedded in a diverse array of gendered cultural contexts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development of Modern American Art , 1870-1930 , Kirsten Swinth takes this model of deep historical contextualization in a different direction by considering how the art world itself was structured , in its educational venues , market system , and critical rhetoric , by concepts profoundly imbued with gendered values . Where Todd excavates gendered motives underlying artistic and social discourses , Swinth turns this process inside out , showing how systemic gender biases shaped the experiences and expectations of artists , audiences , critics , and collectors in varied ways as they sought to understand changing ideals of " high culture " and the relevance of new forms of " modern " art . <p> Focusing on the four decades bracketing the turn of the century , Swinth traces a complex trajectory of shifts in gendered meanings . Beginning with discursive processes , she demonstrates that visual art was valued during the late-nineteenth century for communicating " feminized " restorative sensibilities , viewed in opposition to an increasingly aggressive , industrialized , and " masculinized " business culture . This positive binary contrast was transformed around the turn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionalism that excluded properly " feminine " women practitioners . Early-twentieth-century artists and critics linked avant garde values to the twinned concepts of radical innovation and authentic self-expression , both of which evoked for their contemporaries a masculinized realm of risk and experimentation . This undermined the seemingly gender-neutral concepts of professional expertise that had allowed women to enter the high art system in the previous decades . Ideals of refinement and good taste , privileged before 1900 , were replaced by avant garde resistance to " feminine " sentimentality and support for competitive social criticism and ideals of self-liberation . <p> Swinth also analyzes how gendered attitudes inflected the practice of art , looking at women 's opportunities for art education and career building , their exhibition strategies , the marketing of art , and the language of critical writing . Women 's claims of professionalism were undermined in each sector by ideologies that posed avant garde modernism as a " masculinized formation " resistant to gender equality . At the same time , as many women artists sought professional employment as illustrators and advertising designers , critics responded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified as virile and male ) with mass popular culture ( viewed as derivitive , weak , and feminized ) . Swinth 's text thus draws on cultural studies theory to interweave individual biographies , cultural history , modernist art theory , and gender studies . Although several feminist scholars have already interrogated the gendered construction of stylistic movements in nineteenth-century European and American art , Swinth is the first Americanist scholar to track these concerns up to 1930 and connect them to the era of modernist visual art. ( n5 ) <p> One unexpectedly intriguing aspect of Swinth 's study is her persuasive argument that the gendered biases of New Deal art and Abstract Expressionism , discussed now for more than a decade , can be traced back so clearly into the late-nineteenth century . Her explanation that professionalism provided women with a framework of gender neutrality that these new values undercut will not in itself surprise any feminist scholar , but her array of pertinent examples , going well beyond the ( now familiar ) narrative of O'Keeffe 's problematic professional relationship with Stieglitz , offers provocative new insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural constructs . Women were certainly not supposed to express the " egotism " that avant garde creativity demanded ; Swinth notes that ambitious women at the turn of the century were already labeled " monstrous " ( 159 ) . She goes on to show how , in the 1910s and 1920s , both women and men manipulated new concepts of " sex difference " adopted from Freudian theory to promote modernism 's bohemian , liberatory ideals . Traditional modernist trajectories marked by " rupture , release , and liberation " were merged with ideals of freedom that foregrounded the rejection of sexual inhibitions . However , these discourses placed women in a disquieting position : repression was condemned yet public sensuality was still questioned . Swinth further contextualizes this ploy , in its 1920s format , in relation to class values . She suggests that women and men alike promoted new possibilities for art making that rejected the professional , accessible , but often sentimental values of the preceding decades , opting instead to promote a " constricted vision of art that appealed only to the enlightened few . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evict not only women artists but most middle- and working-class audiences from access to the most elite forms of contemporary creativity ( 168 ) . <p> Unfolding these arguments through the lens of cultural studies , Swinth argues that although women 's efforts to participate in modernist innovation were somewhat successful in reshaping both their lifestyles and the art they produced , the institutional reification of gendered values in the art marketplace was difficult to change . She contrasts women 's minimal presence in national juried exhibitions with their greater numbers in smaller , independent shows and notes that the few successful women gallery owners tended to withhold top billing for women painters and gave them fewer shows than their male peers . She also cites an early occurrence of that most obnoxious of all gendered accolades , the comment by a male critic that a woman 's work appears so virile and assured that it could have been produced by a man , in this case tendered to painter Theresa Bernstein in 1919 ( 191 ) . <p> Swinth ends Painting Professionals with a thoughtful discussion of critical writings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authentic self-expression . Building on Freudian theories , both female and male artists acceded to the belief that men could intellectually harness the energies associated with sexual expression whereas women experienced an " organic sexuality " that was supposedly outside their control . These ideas have frequently been discussed in relation to Stieglitz 's promotion of O'Keeffe 's work ( " At last , a woman on paper " is the most famous of his supposed , but never documented statements ) . Swinth looks at a wider range of contemporary critical reviews that exemplify or subvert this concept . She notes particularly the opinions of Helen Appleton Read , who wrote art criticism for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in the 1920s . Read rejected the simplistic bifurcation of gender identities , commenting in one review : " ... personality carries with it the flavor of sex , but femininity which can be acrid and somber , lyric and gay according to the owner . Femininity can mean as many things as masculinity , not merely the traditional attributes " ( 199 ) . This kind of subtly stated but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernist ideals of self-expression while integrating their professional and sexual identities . <p> The combination of cultural studies methodologies with an emphasis on feminist gender analysis evident in the work of Todd and Swinth offers a provocative model for other feminist scholars in the field who seek to complicate the traditional narratives of our discipline . These works parallel recent publications in American art by scholars such as Michelle Bogart , Sarah Burns , Wanda Corn , and David Lubin , whose texts also analyze art in the context of cultural studies and attend closely to gender issues , although not always making them their central focus. ( n6 ) As the works discussed here demonstrate , feminist art historians continue to work on varied types of projects . These begin with essential efforts to rediscover , assess , and restore women 's work to the art historical canon . From there they have expanded into studies of the intersections of art and varied aspects of contemporary culture . This trajectory culminates in work that questions the deeply gendered ideologies that have shaped art 's most essential intellectual and professional structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American art within U.S. culture .
