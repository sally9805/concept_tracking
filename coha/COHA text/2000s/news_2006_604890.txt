<p> At 26 , catcher Gerald Laird has an above-average arm and a .234 career batting average . Even though he played in only 13 games last season , the Texas Rangers had a steady stream of winter calls about his availability . <p> " The Rangers knew they had a commodity . The only way they were going to part with him was if some team grossly overpaid , " San Diego Padres general manager Kevin Towers says . " I do n't blame ( them ) . I 'd do the same if I were in that position . " <p> After failing to trade for Laird , San Diego signed free agent Mike Piazza , who says , " People say I ca n't throw that well , but I 'm pretty good on offense . There has to be trade-offs . " <p> What 's catching up with baseball is a catching shortage . Catchers with a balance of defense and offense are rare and even more difficult to develop . Teams usually give up one for the other for a simple reason : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a shortage of catchers is putting it mildly , " Chicago White Sox GM Ken Williams says . <p> The Florida Marlins are using Josh Willingham at catcher to get a strong bat in the lineup , even though he 's still learning on defense . The Cleveland Indians ' Ryan Garko is listed at catcher , but he 's better offensively than defensively . He has moved to first base . <p> The Minnesota Twins ' Joe Mauer has the most potential to be the best overall catcher and an annual All-Star , assuming he stays healthy . <p> Mauer , 22 , is a left-handed batter with good knowledge of the strike zone and an ability to hit to all fields and make adjustments , unusual traits for young batters . He batted .294 last season with nine homers and 55 RBI in 131 games ; the Twins believe his power numbers will get better as he matures . He has a strong arm and excellent agility with good leadership skills . <p> The Atlanta Braves are the most loaded at the position , with Brian McCann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every level in the minors , including Jarrod Saltalamacchia , arguably the best catching prospect . <p> But Allan Simpson , editor of Baseball America , says of the four top catchers eligible for the amateur draft in June , no one is a lock to be a first-round pick : " There 's no one out there with the total package . " <p> That 's not news for general managers . They say the limited supply of catching ability goes back to youth baseball , where coaches use their best athletes as pitchers , shortstops and center fielders . Players do n't want to put in the work to learn the unglamorous squatting in the dirt behind the plate . <p> " If there are 10 or 12 catchers among the top 200 high school and college prospects , that 's a lot , " Colorado Rockies GM Dan O'Dowd says . <p> " There is a Help Wanted sign all over Major League Baseball , " Williams says . " If high school and college players , particularly if they are left-handed , have some grit and determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latino catchers on the rise <p> Rich Hofman , who was Alex Rodriguez 's high school coach in Miami and now is at Westminster Academy in Fort Lauderdale , agrees the catching problem starts at the youth levels . He says high school players are n't as work-oriented and there 's a lack of fundamentals instruction . In an age of traveling baseball teams , the emphasis is " showcasing kids and winning games . There is no development . " <p> He says when kids get an opportunity to catch , some take the attitude , " I 'll do it if I have to . " <p> Hofman thinks the future of catching is in converting players from other positions . He says it is a stereotype to think of a catcher as a big , slow kid who ca n't hit . But moving a strong-arm shortstop behind the plate makes sense , " especially if the middle infielder can give you offense . " <p> Jim O'Neill , Mauer 's high school baseball coach at Cretin-Derham in St. Paul , has n't seen a drop-off in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , but he thinks that 's because of Mauer 's rise to success . " A lot of kids want to catch because of Joe Mauer , " O'Neill says . " Realistically , they know they are n't going to be a professional catcher , but they like the position and they want to learn about it . " <p> Houston Astros catcher Raul Chavez of Valencia , Venezuela , thinks catcher is a trendy position among young players in Latin America . Seven of the projected 30 starting catchers this year are Latinos . <p> Chavez , 32 , says it is important to have Latino catchers on rosters . " Because I think it shows ( they ) are smart and aggressive , " he says . " This is an important position because you control the game . You have to be on top of everything and be sure to help out pitchers . " <p> Chavez , a career .215 hitter , signed with Houston as a shortstop . But Bob Watson , then the Astros ' GM , told him early in his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his ticket to the majors , so he agreed . <p> Conversion to position not easy <p> Terry Steinbach , a former All-Star catcher with the Oakland Athletics , was a converted third baseman . <p> The Chicago Cubs ' Michael Barrett is a current convertee . Barrett was a first-round pick by the Montreal Expos in 1995 as a shortstop . Instead of wanting to be a catcher , he " wanted to get to the majors and be like Cal Ripken Jr . while kids today want to be like Derek Jeter or Alex Rodriguez . " <p> But buried on the depth chart among the Expos ' infielders , Barrett switched to catcher and became the regular in 2001 . He won the Silver Slugger award last season as the National League 's best offensive catcher ( .276 , 16 homers , 61 RBI ) . <p> " The most difficult part of the transition is the endurance factor . A catcher is always squatting , " Barrett says . <p> " It 's physical because your legs give out by May or June and mental because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel good . " <p> Conversions are n't for everyone . Barrett worked on catching with Cubs infield prospect Casey McGehee after he was drafted in 2003 . A year later McGehee turned in his shin guards . <p> " It 's a completely different set of skills , and it was n't for me , " McGehee says . " You get beat up blocking balls . You throw differently . Your thumbs are sore , and your at-bats are secondary to what 's going on . Even if you 're on deck to bat , you have to be talking to the pitchers first about the previous inning or the next inning . " <p> McGehee nailed the job description of a big-league catcher . Catchers have to strap on a few pounds of equipment , squat in the dirt 150 times a day , play through pain , be strong enough to lose 8 pounds a game , be a psychologist , learn a pitching staff and forget about their own offense . <p> " You have to learn game plans for 12 or 13 pitchers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Rod Barajas for the Rangers . " Adam Eaton and Kevin Millwood ( will each ) have a different approach to the same batters than Francisco Cordero . " <p> Johnny Estrada , traded from Atlanta to the Arizona Diamondbacks , says there 's so much to learn about his new pitching staff , " I might not feel comfortable until mid-April . " <p> Must start learning in youth <p> Given the choice , managers will take a defensive catcher over a strong bat any day . <p> The Milwaukee Brewers ' catching is split by Damian Miller ( .273 last year ) and Chad Moeller ( .206 in 2005 ) . Miller learned the importance of defense in the minors from coach Phil Roof , a defensive-minded catcher in the 1960s and 1970s who played 15 seasons with a .215 career average . <p> Most catchers play the position today because they volunteered on their first youth teams . That 's what happened to San Francisco Giants catcher Mike Matheny , 35 , growing up in Reynoldsburg , Ohio , east of Columbus . When Matheny was 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit fungoes at him , teaching him how to block balls . He did n't like it . <p> " I was crying , " Matheny says . " It also taught me the ball was n't going to hurt much worse , but I would n't recommend that practice to anyone . " <p> Not only was a work ethic drilled into Matheny , so also was a lifelong love for catching . He ca n't imagine playing another position , and he ca n't stop calling games no matter if he 's on the field or not . <p> " I was trying to set up hitters watching the World Series on TV , " Matheny says , " so I did n't get to enjoy it . But when I called pitches , I enjoyed it . It 's kind of hard to explain . " <p> Contributing : Jorge L. Ortiz
