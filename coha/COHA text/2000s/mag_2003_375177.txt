Even for a White House in which staff members pride themselves on being low-key , Alberto Gonzales is inconspicuous . The flashiest thing he has done recently is briefly regrow his mustache . And yet the modest , Harvard-educated lawyer has a riveting story . The son of migrant workers in Texas , he grew up in a house his dad built , sharing two bedrooms with seven siblings . With no running hot water , the family boiled their bathwater on the stove . No phone meant that Gonzales had to walk to the corner pay phone to call his friends . Even the town 's name was Humble . Gonzales , 47 , has all the traits of the people George W. Bush brought up from Austin  --  loyalty , discretion and self-effacement  --  but his personal history is what really captures the President . " It is n't that Waspy ' Is n't that lovely ? ' kind of thing , " says a source close to Gonzales , " but something the President feels in his heart and soul . He gets emotional about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ability to take the measure of people by looking them in the eye . Within the next few months , he may be measuring some candidates for a long black robe . It is almost certain that by the end of June , when the Supreme Court adjourns for summer recess , at least one Justice will have announced his or her retirement . Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist , 79 , and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , 73 , have expressed a desire to leave . Rehnquist has serious back trouble , and O'Connor would like to return to Arizona with her husband . Both want a Republican President to name their replacement , and they know that retiring in 2004 , an election year , would provoke a confirmation storm that could keep the court in limbo for months . Then there 's the wild card , John Paul Stevens , 83 , a liberal who is likely to stay but is the court 's oldest member . <P> Among the many names floated for the post , no candidate has the President 's trust like Gonzales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder time selling his first choice to his allies than to his antagonists . Democrats , who are locked in a pitched battle with the White House over lower-court nominations , would find it tough to block the first Hispanic nominee to the high court , who has a short and unrevealing record on the bench . They might give him a hard time as payback for his treatment of them while he was White House counsel , but a rejection would play badly with Hispanic voters , whom the Democrats are eager to court . <P> For conservative Republicans , however , Gonzales is not even on the to list . They crave a Justice who is strict and outspoken on core conservative issues , namely abortion and affirmative action , and for them Gonzales is too much of a cipher , perhaps too moderate . " To Bush 's core constituency , " says Phyllis Schlafly , president of the conservative action group the Eagle Forum , " the appointment to the Supreme Court ranks as the No. 1 issue that they care about . Bush went through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas . We are not going to put up with another David Souter . " Bush the elder 's first Supreme Court pick was Souter , and the fact that he has turned out to be a more liberal Justice than anyone expected deeply upsets conservatives .
