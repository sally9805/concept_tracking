Until Sept. 11 , 2001 , the radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam was considered a local problem . Based in the Kurdish controlled areas of northern Iraq , with a membership of militant fundamentalists determined to impose Islamic rule , the group raised its profile three years ago by blowing up beauty parlors and sloshing acid in the faces of unveiled Kurdish women . Ansar , like Saddam Hussein , is arrayed against the separatist Kurds of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) and the Kurdestan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , whose ragtag forces lie between it and Baghdad . Ansar hates all infidels , but mainly the ones in its neighborhood . " If they could get to Americans , they would spare no effort to do so , " says a senior Kurdish intelligence official , " but since they can not , they are happy to kill us instead . " <P> The group is being touted by Bush Administration officials as a critical link between Saddam and al-Qaeda . Ansar has roughly 500 to 700 members , including several dozen so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Afghanistan and fled to Ansar 's enclave in Iraq after the fall of the Taliban . Kurds who have escaped the area say the group has set up a Taliban-like regime , under which women are veiled and Islamic law is he Aonored  --  or else . According to a former Iraqi intelligence agent imprisoned by Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq , a member of Ansar 's ruling council , Abu Wa'el , once worked for Saddam 's intelligence agency , though PUK officials can not confirm the link . But some connection between Ansar and Iraq seems clear . <P> The group continues to pose a threat to the anti-Baghdad Kurds . Last year Ansar assailants attempted to assassinate the PUK 's prime minister in Suleimaniya , leaving five bodyguards dead in a gun battle that coincided with a visit by U.S. officials . Interviewed in prison , the sole surviving attacker said he was working for the glory of Allah and later hanged himself with his black cotton belt . There are indications , however , that Ansar 's strength may be waning . The Iranian government last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , robbing the group of the cover of high mountains there . U.S. and Turkish military officers have investigated the front line and reportedly come away unimpressed . A senior Turkish official dismissed Ansar as a " cult . " <P> A big blow came with the arrest last fall of the group 's leader , Mullah Krekar , while he was passing through the Netherlands en route to Norway , where he is applying for asylum . Krekar , a Marxist turned cleric whose real name is Najmuddin Faraj and who fought the Soviets in Afghanistan , flatly denies that his group has ties to al-Qaeda or Saddam . " I never had links with Saddam 's family , government , party  --  not in the past , not now , not inside Iraq or outside , " he told the BBC last week in Oslo . Ultimately , Kurdish officials are less impressed with the group 's significance than the Americans are . " They 're newsworthy , " says a senior KDP official . " But they have no importance for the future of Iraq . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kucera/Erbil . With reporting by Massimo Calabresi/Washington
