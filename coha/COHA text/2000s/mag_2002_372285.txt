A few Saturdays ago , a group of students scrambled into seats at Brother Rice High School in suburban Detroit to take the SAT college entrance exam . Some of their feet did n't touch the floor . Why ? Because dozens of the students were seventh-graders or younger . One was in third grade . That same morning , my own daughters , ages 6 , 10 and 12 , were at home , watching cartoons and eating Pop-Tarts . It did n't occur to me to measure their smarts against those of high-schoolers . Or even to fake doing so , like " boy genius " Justin Chapman 's mother , who falsely claimed that her 6-year-old son had a perfect math score . <P> The SAT is open to anyone who pays a $25 fee , and parents are having their kids take it at younger and younger ages  --  for practice , for bragging rights , for a chance to get into programs for gifted children at universities like Johns Hopkins . More than 172,000 students in eighth grade or lower took SAT or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 . <P> Donna Coughlin , who administers the SAT in Winnetka , Ill. , says the surge in " midget " test takers makes for " a brutal morning . " Young kids ask endless questions , do more fidgeting , need more bathroom breaks and are more apt to throw up . <P> Much of the SAT 's material is n't taught until high school , so younger children often score poorly . Critics say giving the test so early saps the confidence of insecure kids and creates competitive students who focus not on learning but on mastering standardized tests . <P> Those who favor early testing say it allows bright students to see how far beyond grade level they are , so their learning can be adjusted . And some precocious kids enjoy the challenge . " It gives them terrific experience at test taking , " says Susan Grant , whose son first tried the SAT in sixth grade and now attends Harvard . In Farmington Hills , Mich. , Aaron Dubin , 18 , has taken the SAT nine times since he was 12 , lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a practice run for peewee test takers . To join " gifted " programs , students in grades 3 through 6 can take an ACT designed for eighth-graders . It 's not for my kids , though . They have cartoons to watch , CDs to play , childhoods to live . I cringed when I heard about a mom who brought her video camera to a classroom window at a Michigan high school . Her child was inside taking this ACT , and she wanted to capture the moment . <P> " It was a bumper crowd of little kids , with parents in the hallway trying to get a glimpse of them , " recalls Rob Leider , assistant principal at the school , West Bloomfield High . His heart went out to these youngsters : " They seemed pretty studious . But when they finished and came out of the rooms , they were little kids lost in a big building , looking for their mothers .
