Dick Wolf looked skeptically at the shiny new video iPod he had given his 12-year-old son for Christmas , and prepared to watch a downloaded version of 24 for the first time . " Who 's going to see anything on this screen ? " shrugged the 59-year-old TV producer , whose Law &; Order dramas favor gritty , realistic street scenes over high-tech gadgetry and geekspeak . But when Wolf inserted the white earbuds and started watching the 2.5-in . LCD , he had an epiphany . " The screen size became meaningless . I was in the moment . After 30 seconds , I knew it would change the game . " <P> The game is the $60 billion television industry . When the savvy producer pitched a new crime show called Power to NBC , he made sure to play up its download-ready qualities . In Wolf 's words : " I drank the Kool-Aid . " As Wolf and other producers sell their wares in the annual TV-industry ritual known as development season , new technologies are changing the way they do business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 200 million 3-GB mobile phones , an estimated 4 million iPods and other devices , the Big Four networks ( ABC , NBC , CBS and Fox ) are scrambling for ways to deliver content over a panoply of platforms . They are also scrambling to figure out a business model that can predictably deliver profits in this variegated market . <P> It used to be that hit shows aired once or twice on a TV network , then had an afterlife in seemingly endless reruns on local stations or down-the-dial cable outfits .

Or sometimes before . Late last month , NBC debuted another new Wolf drama , Conviction , on Apple 's iTunes weeks before its network premiere , to generate buzz for the series . <P> Those new distribution channels are reconfiguring the programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore in terms of just airing on TV , " says Larry Gerbrandt , a senior analyst for Nielsen Media Research . " The network has become the first of multiple windows and screens that get exploited . They 're now beginning to view themselves as more than broadcasters . " An IBM Institute for Business Value study in January was even more blunt : " This is the beginning of the ' end of television as we know it . ' " <P> The so-called end-time began last October , after ABC agreed to put Lost and Desperate Housewives on Apple 's iTunes store as $1.99 downloads , giving viewers their first taste of ( legal ) Internet access to hit shows . " Every new-technology company had been courting us , " recalls Disney-ABC TV president Anne Sweeney . " It 's one thing to discuss possibilities , but when we saw the video iPod and iTunes store , the consumer experience was so vibrant , it convinced us that this was the right technology .
