Brambleclaw stood in the middle of the clearing , gazing at what was left of the ThunderClan camp . A crescent moon , thin as a claw , drifted above the trees that surrounded the stone hollow . Its pale light revealed the dens trampled down , the thorn barrier at the camp entrance broken and tossed aside , and the wounded cats of ThunderClan slowly creeping from the shadows , their fur bristling and their eyes stretched wide with shock . Brambleclaw could still hear the trampling of the badgers as they lumbered away . The undergrowth beyond the entrance quivered where they had pushed through , driven off with the help of Onestar and the WindClan warriors who had come just in time to help ThunderClan . But it was n't the sight of devastation that pricked Brambleclaw 's pelt and kept his paws frozen to the ground . Two cats he had never thought he 'd see again were picking their way carefully among the scattered thorns of the entrance barrier . They were uninjured , their pelts sleek and their eyes alight with alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brambleclaw called . The powerful gray tomcat paced forward until he could touch noses with Brambleclaw . " It 's good to see you again , " he meowed . " I . . . I wanted to see if you 'd found a place to live . But what has happened here ? " " Badgers , " Brambleclaw replied . He glanced around , wondering where to beginhelping his wounded and frightened Clanmates . Beside Stormfur , the slender brown tabby she-cat brushed her tail against a long scratch on Brambleclaw 's shoulder . " You 're hurt , " she mewed . Brambleclaw twitched his ears . " It 's nothing . Welcome to ThunderClan , Brook . I 'm sorry you had to travel so far to find us like this . " He paused and looked from one to the other . " Is everything all right in the Tribe of Rushing Water ? I never expected you to come visit us so soon . " Stormfur shot a glance at Brook , so swift Brambleclaw almost missed it . " Everything 's fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you had found a new place to live , like StarClan promised . " Brambleclaw looked around the devastated camp , the stricken cats stumbling through the remains of their home . " Yes , we found it , " he murmured . " You said badgers attacked you ? " Brook prompted , sounding puzzled . " They came here on purpose , " Brambleclaw explained . " StarClan knows where they came from , more badgers than I 've ever seen in my life . They would have killed us all if WindClan had n't turned up . " His paws trembled , and he sank his claws into the bloodstained earth to keep himself steady . Stormfur nodded . " Do n't worry about telling us everything now . What can we do to help ? " Brambleclaw sent a silent prayer of thanks to StarClan that they had chosen this moment to send his old friend back to the Clans . He and Stormfur had been through a lot together on the first journey to the sun-drown-place , and he could think of few cats he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head as a thin wail came from a trampled clump of ferns at the edge of the hollow . " We need to find all the cats that have been badly wounded . Some will be on their way to join StarClan , " he warned , glancing at Brook . " The badgers came to kill , not drive us out . " Brook met his gaze steadily . " Whatever they have done , I want to help . I have seen this kind of savagery before from Sharptooth , remember ? " Sharptooth was a giant mountain cat that had terrorized the Tribe of Rushing Water for many moons , until the cats from the forest arrived . Stormfur 's sister , Feathertail , had died in the fall that killed the savage animal . " We 'll do whatever we have to , " Stormfur promised . " Just tell us what to do . Are you ThunderClan 's deputy now ? " Brambleclaw studied a fragment of moss that was trapped under his front paw . " No , " he admitted . " Firestar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Graystripe more time to come back . " " That 's tough . " There was a note of sympathy in Stormfur 's voice that made Brambleclaw wince . He did n't want any cat 's pity . Suddenly Brook froze . " I thought you said the badgers had gone , " she hissed . Brambleclaw whipped around , then relaxed as he saw a familiar , pointed , black-and-white face pushing its way out of a clump of dead bracken . Stormfur touched Brook 's shoulder lightly with his tail . " That 's Midnight , " he meowed . " She would n't hurt any cats . " He bounded forward to meet the elderly badger . Midnight peered at Stormfur with shortsighted eyes . Then she gave a small nod . " Cat friend from journey , " she rumbled . " Good it is to see you again . And this cat from mountain Tribe , is she not ? " she added , gesturing with her snout toward Brook . " That 's right , " Stormfur meowed . " This is Brook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He beckoned Brook forward with his tail ; she went over reluctantly , as if she could n't quite believe this badger was friendly . Brambleclaw understood her feelings ; he knew Midnight as well as any cat , but it was hard not to look at her bulky shape without remembering snapping jaws , fierce gleaming eyes , and claws that shredded cats ' fur like leaves in newleaf . . . . There was the sound of heavy paws , and he looked up to see Midnight standing beside him . Grief and anger sparked from her berry-bright eyes . " Too late my warning , " she rasped . " Not enough could I do . " " You brought WindClan to help us , " Brambleclaw pointed out . " Without you , our whole Clan would have been wiped out . " Midnight bowed her head , the white stripe that ran the length of her snout gleaming in the faint moonlight . " Shame for my kin I feel . " " Every cat knows this attack had nothing to do with you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Clan . " Midnight still looked troubled . Behind her , Brambleclaw spotted his Clan leader near the center of the clearing , with Onestar and the WindClan warriors . He padded toward them , motioning with his . . .
