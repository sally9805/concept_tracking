A test of unconscious attitudes polarizes psychologists <p> It lurks in the mind 's dark basement , secretly shaping our opinions , attitudes , and stereotypes . This devious manipulator does its best to twist our behavior to its nefarious end . Its stock in trade : stirring up racial prejudice and a host of other pernicious preconceptions about members of various groups . Upstairs , our conscious mind ignores this pushy cellar dweller and assumes that we 're decent folk whose actions usually reflect good intentions . <p> Welcome to the disturbing world of implicit bias , where people 's preferences for racial , ethnic , and other groups lie outside their awareness and often clash with their professed beliefs about those groups . In the past 15 years , most social psychologists have come to agree that implicit biases , also known as unconscious attitudes , play an often-unnoticed role in our lives . Researchers study implicit biases using any of several techniques , such as tracking participants ' feelings and behaviors after subliminally showing them pictures of black or old people . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved especially popular . Since its introduction in 1998 , more than 250 IAT-related studies have been published . More than 3 million IATs have been completed on a Web site ( https : **32;5110;TOOLONG ) established by the test 's major proponents-Anthony G. Greenwald of the University of Washington in Seattle , Mahzarin R. Banaji of Harvard University , and Brian A. Nosek of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville . Other online venues run by organizations concerned about various types of discrimination also offer the IAT to visitors . <p> The huge IAT database contains troubling findings that have been highly publicized . For example , more than three-quarters of white and Asian test takers in the United States display an unconscious tendency to value white people over black people . Roughly half of black test takers show a pro-white bias as well . Many people who complete the IAT exhibit implicit inclinations for young versus old people and unconsciously favor men over women . <p> Such results challenge the traditional view in psychology that each person knows his or her social attitudes and stereotypes , Banaji says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if they disavow those preferences when asked about them , in her view . In the post-Civil Rights era , few people admit to harboring ill will toward blacks or to acting in a racially discriminating style , but IAT results reveal a stubborn undercurrent of white favoritism with the potential to stoke bigoted behavior , in Banaji 's view . <p> Virtually from the start , the test sparked a schism in social psychology . The IAT taps into much more than individuals ' unconscious attitudes , critics contend . Familiarity with members of those groups , knowledge of cultural attitudes toward particular groups , and test-taking tactics influence IAT scores , they say . <p> Critics also argue that specific IAT scores are meaningless because they have n't been tied to relevant , real-world behaviors . No one should assume that he or she is unconsciously prejudiced against black people on the basis of an IAT score , these investigators hold . <p> Psychologist William von Hippel of the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia , has followed the IAT debate closely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detractors , " von Hippel says . " The IAT should be vigorously researched and debated , but we still do not really understand what it reveals . " <p> FEEL THE CONFLICT Go to the IAT Web site and you can probe personal preferences on more than 90 topics , including pets , politics , sports teams , and musical styles . But the IAT measure of attitudes about race draws the most attention . The roughly 5-minute , two-part test " provides a palpable experience of mental conflict that leads to an opportunity for self-examination , " says Nosek . <p> The IAT measures the ease with which people associate words or pictures representing either of two contrasting groups-such as white people and black people or men and women-with positive or negative meanings . <p> For instance , on one popular version of the racial IAT , participants first press a certain key on a computer keyboard as quickly as possible when they see either an image of a black person 's face or a word , such as tragedy or rotten , that has unpleasant connotations . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white person 's face or a word , such as love or health , that has pleasant implications . <p> In a reversal of this task , participants then rapidly press the same key in response to either black faces or pleasant words and another key when shown either white faces or unpleasant words . <p> Many volunteers , as they take the test , realize that it 's easier to link black faces with unpleasant words and white faces with pleasant words than vice versa . Greenwald and his coworkers surmised in 1998 that the speedier such associations occurred , the more participants unconsciously preferred whites to blacks . <p> Several investigations suggest that it 's difficult to initially manipulate one 's IAT score . However , people who take the IAT many times or who receive explicit cheating instructions can fake their scores . " I 've taken the IAT so many times that I know how to get any score I want to on it , " Nosek says . <p> Still , the IAT does a good job of tapping into the implicit attitudes that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , Nosek cites Yale University psychologist T. Andrew Poehlman 's unpublished statistical review of 61 studies . It finds that IAT scores do better than self-reports at forecasting results of lab tests of behavior motivated by stereotypes and racial attitudes . For instance , white people who describe themselves as unaffected by a person 's race but display strong implicit bias against blacks on the IAT are especially apt to make unfriendly or rude overtures toward a black person in a brief laboratory encounter . <p> In contrast , in predicting choices of consumer products and political candidates , self-reports prove superior to IAT scores , according to Poehlman 's review . <p> In another unpublished study , not included in the review , Banaji and her coworkers found that , among 291 white physicians , those exhibiting strong implicit bias against blacks also prescribed a state-of-the-art heart treatment far more often to hypothetical white patients than to their black counterparts . <p> IMPLICITLY YOURS According to its proponents , the IAT illuminates a common characteristic of unconscious attitudes toward ethnic and social groups : Such views are easily formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating in psychologist Aiden P. Gregg 's experiment had never heard of Niffites or Luupites , but they were asked to imagine the two make-believe ethnic groups . In the experiment at the University of Southampton in England , each participant read an account of how one group , depicted as savage and ruthless , invaded and slaughtered the other , portrayed as civilized and peaceful . <p> The participants then read a series of names on a computer screen . Niffite names featured a double consonant and ended in " nif , " such as Eskannif . Luupite names included a double vowel and ended in " lup , " such as Neenolup . Each name from the designated invading group was preceded by a subliminally presented negative word , such as barbaric . Each name from the victim group was preceded by a subliminally presented positive word , such as benevolent . <p> Immediately afterward , students reported not only a conscious preference for the peaceful group but also displayed an implicit preference for it over the invading group on an IAT . <p> In further experiments at universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Niffites and Luupites as in previous tests . They then either were informed that a computer error had accidentally switched descriptions of the imaginary groups or were given a new passage to read that described how historical forces had turned the victims into vengeful aggressors , while the original invaders became peaceful . <p> Self-reported opinions about the groups usually reversed at that point , says Gregg . In contrast , original implicit attitudes toward the groups remained largely the same , Gregg 's team reports in the January Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . <p> " If automatic attitudes prove to be generally easier to acquire than they are to eliminate . then right-minded attitudes should be instilled first before wrong-headed ones gain a foothold , " the researchers conclude . <p> MYSTERY METRIC No one knows how , or whether , IAT scores apply to relevant real-life behaviors , says psychologist Hart Blanton of Texas A &M; University in College Station . For instance , researchers who rely on the test consider a racial IAT score of 1.3 an indication of a strong unconscious bias against blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.3 is more likely to , say , hire whites over blacks than is a person who scores 1.2 or 0.6 . <p> Although IAT scores forecast volunteers ' behavior in laboratory situations better than self-reports do , Poehlman 's review shows that the test 's capacity to predict behaviors related to racial prejudice or other malign attitudes is still relatively weak , Blanton says . <p> The test operates on vague and questionable theoretical assumptions about attitude formation , Blanton contends . Several serious problems mar interpretations of the results . <p> It 's not known whether the range of possible scores on the racial IAT encompasses the entire range of implicit preferences toward whites and blacks , Blanton and James Jaccard of Florida International University in Miami assert in the January American Psychologist . The IAT may cover only the low-to-middle end of the actual range , or only the middle-to-upper end of the range . Many psychological measures , including popular self-esteem and depression scales , have the same limitation . <p> Consider the racial-association test , which contrasts the relative speed of making positive and negative associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicit antiblack bias may regard blacks negatively and whites positively , may regard both groups positively but whites more so , or may regard both groups negatively but blacks more so . A final score offers no help in distinguishing among these possibilities . <p> Moreover , implicit bias may stem primarily from attitudes toward a single racial group , not from a preference for one group over another , Blanton suggests . Racist views held by volunteers primarily reflect an implicit tendency to view blacks negatively , regardless of the volunteers ' opinion about whites , he and his coworkers propose in the March Journal of Experimental Social Psychology . <p> Blanton 's team developed a test to examine that prospect . The researchers separately assessed the speed with which participants associated typical African-American names with positive words , African-American names with negative words , European-American names with positive words , and European-American names with negative words . In each instance , participants ' response speed was compared with the time needed to make neutral associations , such as pairing words for pieces of furniture with synonyms for " middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative words frequently scored high on a questionnaire probing for negative attitudes about blacks , regardless of how quickly they associated white names with positive or negative words . By contrasting a person 's rapid associations to blacks and whites , the IAT may thus hide more than it reveals about simmering racial prejudice , Blanton says . <p> LOSE THE ATTITUDE Other lines of research portray the IAT as a measure complicated by factors beyond unconscious attitudes . <p> IAT scores tap into the greater ease of making positive associations when dealing with familiar social categories , according to psychologist Jan De Houwer of Ghent University in Belgium . In a 2001 study , De Houwer administered a British-foreigner IAT to British participants . Volunteers more easily associated British citizens , ranging from the revered Queen Mother to a notorious mass murderer , with pleasant words . In contrast , they more easily linked an array of foreigners , from the celebrated Albert Einstein to the despised Adolf Hitler , to unpleasant words . <p> The IAT 's focus on linking racial groups to general " pleasant " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , such as awareness that blacks are often portrayed negatively in news stories and movies , says psychologist Russell H. Fazio of Ohio State University in Columbus . <p> Volunteers score lower on implicit racial bias if their associations concern only personal preferences , Fazio contends . In a 2004 investigation , he and his Ohio State colleague Michael A. Olson developed a " personalized IAT , " which required associating black and white names with positive or negative words under the headings either of " I like " or " I do n't like . " The investigators found that while most white volunteers displayed implicit bias against blacks on a traditional IAT , far fewer displayed implicit bias on the personalized test . <p> Even more disturbing is preliminary evidence that people can easily fake their IAT scores . In a 2005 study , Klaus Fiedler of the University of Heidelberg in Germany administered an IAT of implicit attitudes toward Germans and Turks to 198 German volunteers . He then asked participants to retake the test and fake their responses but offered no specific instructions on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually by hesitating before responding to associations that they had previously made more quickly . Two experienced IAT testers who examined the results found it nearly impossible to identify IAT fakers , Fiedler says . <p> LEGAL STAKES Scientific conclusions about the IAT have the potential to reverberate through law and politics . Consider the fate of affirmative action programs . <p> In 2003 , Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that in 25 years affirmative action would no longer be needed . Harvard 's Banaji and law professor Jerry Kang of the University of California , Los Angeles hold that no date can be specified today . Affirmative action and other measures to rectify discrimination should end " when measures of implicit bias for a region or nation are at zero or some rough behavioral equivalent , " Kang and Banaji write in an upcoming California Law Review . <p> Average IAT scores of big chunks of the U.S. population provide a reasonable estimate of the societal reach of racial discrimination , which remains disturbingly common , they assert . <p> The IAT can neither read minds nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Tetlock of the University of California , Berkeley . He and law professor Stephen Mitchell of Florida State University in Tallahassee cite research by Blanton and others to argue that , in many cases , IAT scores reflect emotional reactions that have nothing to do with antiblack sentiment . <p> Many people react to black faces or names on an IAT test with compassion and guilt over African-Americans ' past and current plight , a response that could slow their speed in associating blacks with positive words just as surely as deep-seated hostility toward African-Americans could , Mitchell and Tetlock suggest . IAT researchers have yet to explore this possibility . <p> Blanton greets any application of the IAT with trepidation . " IAT scores ca n't be meaningfully interpreted , " he says . One of his students , a biracial woman raised by her white mother , was extremely upset by her IAT score indicating implicit antiblack bias , although her score could have easily reflected greater familiarity with whites than blacks , Blanton notes . " No one should be provided with the kind of feedback given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Although Nosek upholds the test 's value , he says that there are still " many unresolved issues about the nature of the IAT and its potential for revealing disquieting aspects about human minds .

Psychologists disagree vehemently about whether a simple test shows that many people harbor unconscious prejudice against blacks that may promote bigoted behavior . <p> By Bruce Bower <p>
