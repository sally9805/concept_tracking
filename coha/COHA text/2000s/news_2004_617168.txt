<p> Bill Dunaway hardly ever raises his voice , but now he 's no stranger to being yelled at . <p> Entering the second half of his four-year term , Marietta 's freshman mayor cut his political teeth on the city 's rawest nerve  --  the Westside traffic snarl on Whitlock Avenue . <p> Dunaway floated a traffic plan long considered politically untouchable . He asked a reluctant City Council to vote on the Reynolds Street Connector , a proposal to drive an asphalt bypass through an established neighborhood . <p> " One of my favorite presidents , Harry Truman , said , ' If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen , ' " Dunaway told a crowd of angry Westside residents in September . " However , I do n't think good old Harry ever tried standing in front of a blast furnace . " <p> With a mix of quiet resolve and self-deprecation , Dunaway reaped a whirlwind of political unpopularity . The one-time neighborhood drugstore owner and restaurateur who had spent most of his 64 years selling cold medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant . <p> Hundreds of otherwise well-mannered Marietta residents let Dunaway know his plan was unwelcome . <p> " Leadership is the ability to unify a large number of people , " Dunaway said with an air of sarcasm . " Well , I unified a large number of people . " <p> A similar law of unintended consequences has visited Dunaway 's careers . <p> His last attempt at running for mayor was marred by a lawsuit filed by his sister over the sale of his family 's longtime business , Dunaway Drugs . At the time , Dunaway said the suit was politically motivated . He does n't discuss family relationships today . <p> He lost that 1989 election by 73 votes . He turned away from politics and opened a restaurant three years later , the 1848 House . The restaurant was widely acclaimed and successful , but Dunaway closed it after 10 years . Though profitable , he worried about the restaurant 's long-term viability . <p> Armed with a Harvard MBA and a lifetime of living and working in Marietta , Dunaway traded a quiet retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised in his campaign to bring change , and change has come  --  to the Marietta Conference Center and Resort , the city 's financially troubled Internet supplier and its public housing authority . <p> At least one person has made up his mind on Dunaway 's political future : Bill Dunaway . He resolved a year ago to run again for mayor . He admits that , given the Whitlock Avenue affair , he may not be alone . <p> " I do n't regret bringing it forward . I wanted that public hearing . But it 's probably guaranteed me opposition when I run for re-election , " he said . <p> Residents berated Dunaway for weeks , accusing him of wanting to bulldoze brick homes for the convenience of commuters from west Cobb County and Paulding County . He never flinched , preferring instead to let the neighborhood vent its rage at him so the problem could be addressed once and for all . <p> " Someone had to be the lightning rod , " Dunaway said . " That 's part of the reason people voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He wanted the City Council to issue a public opinion about the Reynolds Street Connector or leave it behind for good . Instead of brokering a backroom deal , he forced the City Council 's hand and put a proposal to study the traffic plan on a council agenda . <p> The council unanimously voted down the measure in September . Dunaway then turned to an outside arbiter , the Georgia Conservancy , to broker a solution between traffic planners and residents . The environmental group told the city at Christmas to ask someone else . <p> Costly goal achieved <p> Despite the political costs , Dunaway said he achieved his goal . He promised to address the problem of cut-through traffic that threatens the city 's neighborhoods . In the Whitlock Avenue case , all the solutions are bad , he maintains . But continuing to allow an ever-increasing number of cars to speed through Marietta 's once-quiet residential boulevards is not acceptable either , he said . <p> " There are no easy solutions , " Dunaway said with characteristic aplomb . " If there were , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's trying to apply lessons from his business successes to his budding political career . In business , he learned two things : Be direct with employees and accommodating to customers . Dunaway 's handling of the Whitlock Avenue vote shows how he has tried to synthesize his professional experience . <p> " I think I was a pretty good manager , but my management style has always been direct . But here in city government , I 'm like a chairman of the board , " Dunaway said . " I ca n't direct anybody . I can talk to city employees , but it 's more problem solving . " <p> He dealt with City Council by placing the Whitlock traffic study on the agenda without the members ' consent ; he then opened the door for residents to give their opinions . <p> " Always listen , " Dunaway said . " It 's not just listening ; you had to understand in the retail business that in Marietta most of your customers were engineers or pilots . Then I had a store in Gainesville , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk in their vocabulary , you have to know why they think the way they do , and what their values are . " <p> Council member Betty Lou Hunter said the mayor still needs to work on his relationship with the City Council . <p> " I think there 's a little better relationship with the mayor than there has been . I 'd like to see that continue to improve , " Hunter said . " He needs to be careful about not being real pushy . When he does talk to the council , he 's pushing his agenda and not listening , like there 's no way but his way . <p> " I think the council is getting things done . The mayor ca n't get anything accomplished if he does n't have support of the council . Many times he 's getting credit for something that the whole council is getting done , " she said . <p> For all practical purposes , Whitlock Avenue is a dead issue . City leaders are trying to arrange a meeting with state transportation agencies , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regional solution for the problems at Marietta Square . No one expects those solutions to come soon . <p> The lack of forward movement on Whitlock is in contrast to the swift changes brought to the Marietta Conference Center . The city opened the $27 million center in 1996 , and it has since struggled to become profitable . <p> According to a Georgia Tech study , the Powder Springs Road site lodged up to 100,000 visitors a year and had a 40 percent occupancy rate . <p> In June , the city bought out  --  for $1.5 million  --  New York-based Sentry Hospitality 's contract to manage the center . The city hired Dallas-based Remington Hotels Corp . to replace Sentry . Remington 's contract expires July 31 . <p> The change came after the mayor and council criticized Sentry 's management . City officials said the center lost $5.3 million over seven years . The city complained of accounting irregularities and overcharges  --  claims Sentry disputed . <p> Good moves on center <p> Council member Philip Goldstein , a longtime conference center supporter , said the city has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The conference center is moving in a good direction , and the council has worked going in a lease direction and it 's nice to have the concurrence of the mayor , " Goldstein said . <p> Dunaway also promised to stanch the flow of red ink with the city 's Internet service provider , FiberNet . The Marietta Board of Lights and Water owns FiberNet . <p> O.D. Reynolds , manager of the Marietta Board of Lights and Water , resigned in November to take a position in private industry , said Bob Snelson , interim board manager . <p> Most recently , the city voted to hire a consultant to help sell the city 's FiberNet Internet service provider to an outside buyer . Last month , the city agreed to pay North Carolina-based Blue Ridge Advisory Services Group $5,000 a month for six months to find a buyer . <p> " We 've had a lot of false starts on doing something about FiberNet , " Dunaway said . " We 're going to take a tremendous loss . " <p> FiberNet provides high-speed Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marietta  --  spread through Cobb , Atlanta and north Fulton County . The Board of Lights and Water provides sewer , water and power service to city residents , Snelson said . <p> The city has spent $33 million to maintain FiberNet , but will likely receive only a small percentage of its investment from a sale . An audit prepared last year by OmniMedia Associates estimated the value of FiberNet at between $3.8 million and $7.5 million . <p> Councilwoman Hunter does n't want to see FiberNet sold at such a low price . <p> If the city follows through on the sale , she said , it will assume a huge and unnecessary loss . She said Dunaway may be pushing to sell FiberNet prematurely before it could fetch a higher price . <p> " We 're going to do it regardless of what facts might show , because we promised we 'd get rid of FiberNet . That 's a popular stance , " Hunter said . " We 've got a lot of money invested in that , and I certainly do n't want to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city created FiberNet in 1997 as a hedge against possible losses in its core power business because of utilities deregulation in the mid-1990s . <p> " FiberNet has been a political issue for the last couple of years , " Snelson said . " It 's had a string of losses on the financial sheets for some time . " <p> Dunaway said he hopes to spend the rest of his term focusing on the key issue of low homeownership in Marietta . The city 's 63 percent rental rate drags down city schools and the appearance of properties . <p> The council has taken steps to work with the Marietta Housing Authority on the massive redevelopment of two sites , the former Johnny Walker Homes and Clay Homes . <p> The city is expected in the coming weeks to announce a developer for its tax allocation district , which proposes to turn Johnny Walker into a neighborhood of single-family homes , shops and parks . <p> The Johnny Walker Homes site will be financed through a tax allocation district . The district will allow the city to make improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city and county voted by large margins to adopt the tax district last year . <p> Dunaway hopes the Johnny Walker tax district will be the first of up to a dozen districts to shift the majority of city residents from renters to owners . Councilman Johnny Sinclair said the new faces on City Council all support redevelopment . <p> " A lot of time at City Hall is spent just dealing with the conference center and FiberNet rather than schools and parks and how to make the city a better place to live , " he said . " One thing Mayor Dunaway and I share is our passion for redevelopment . " <p> Other than . <p> " There 's no two ways about it  --  I 've made some mistakes in that area . I have a certain impatience , " Dunaway said . " But I like what I 'm doing , and I think I 'm doing some good . "
