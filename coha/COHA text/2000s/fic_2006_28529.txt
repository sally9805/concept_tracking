My name is Beauty . It is likely that you have heard of me . My story , or rather , the one they tell of me , has been told too many times to count . But that is not really my story at all . The particulars have been disregarded entirely . I would have thought that with all the telling of it someone would have , just once , stumbled upon the truth . And perhaps some of you did read between those illusory lines and suspect the truth , incredible and shocking as it is . Or maybe the truth is really too fantastic to believe . I admit there are times when I can hardly believe it myself , and it all seems like a faraway dream . In fact , some of what has been put down in the various accounts of my life is true , for , in order to save my poor father 's life , I did consent to live with a fearsome creature that was more beast than man . It is also true that I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , the storybooks are quite accurate in their exposition for the Beast , immediately upon my avowal of love , was released from an evil curse and returned to his original form as a charming prince . We were married that very day . But that is where the similarities between the legends you have read and my own incredible narrative end . For I have not lived " happily ever after " since that day . You see , Imiss my Beast . As I languish here within the lonely halls of this castle , my mind often drifts back to the very first day I spent here . It was with much trepidation that I left my bedchamber that day , very cautiously , to make my way through the vast corridors that twist and turn throughout this fortress . Despite much speculation over the matter ( for I had slept not one wink the night before ) , I could not imagine why the Beast had requested my presence there . I spent the day alone , wandering in and out of rooms and exploring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store for me . This is not to say that I came to the great castle of the Beast against my will , for I was quite anxious to leave the poverty and boredom of my childhood behind me , and so when obligation awarded me this adventure , I was not entirely dissatisfied . I could not have said what a castle should look like , but it seemed to me that everything I saw was exactly as it should be . Very austere-looking ancestors silently gazed down at me from the lofty positions where their portraits hung superciliously upon the walls . Other walls displayed splendidly woven tapestries of French picnics , Italian vineyards and other exotic affairs . The furniture was intricately carved from the finest lumber , and the carpets were extravagantly thick and colorful . In short , everything was quite extraordinary in its elegance and splendor . I did not chance to meet the Beast while roaming the castle that day . He had , upon my arrival the previous evening , instructed a servant to take me directly to my bedchamber after I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange detachment as he loaded two brimming trunks onto his coach . These were gifts from the Beast , who instructed that they be filled with treasures for my father to take away with him . It calmed and pleased me to imagine my family 's delight when opening those trunks . I did not stir from my bedroom during the remainder of the night , sleepless though I was . I pondered the end of my old life during the long hours of that quiet night , and even into the next day as I drifted from room to room , examining everything at leisure , without seeing a single soul about the place . Supper was announced with the tinkling of a bell , and it was there that I once again encountered the Beast . Despite his gruesome appearance and gruff voice , I was pleasantly surprised to discover that he was , in fact , a gracious host , and we passed that first dinner with pleasant conversation and food and drink that delighted the palate . As soon as the meal was concluded , the Beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes for a moment before asking , " Will you marry me , Beauty ? " I stared at the Beast in utter astonishment . What was I to do ? Though my heart was hammering a loud warning of caution not to anger the Beast , I somehow managed to whisper , " No , Beast . " The Beast merely nodded bleakly , saying , " Very well , then , " in a tone that indicated he had expected my reply , and he abruptly left the hall . Relieved that I had not provoked the Beast with my refusal to his preposterous request , I too left the dining room to retire for the evening . Have I forgotten to describe my bedchamber ? Do not think it is because the room was not worth mentioning , for it was , and continues to be , the most beautiful room I would find in this elegant castle . When first entering the chamber on the previous evening , I was too preoccupied to take much notice of my surroundings . On this night , however , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful array of objects that had been placed there for my pleasure , until at last my eyes beheld the extraordinary bed upon which I was to sleep . Along its towering posts it displayed , in great detail , the carved images of wild animals , spiraling along the edges and seemingly moving upward until , at the top , there sat a beautiful man with a crown . I knew not the meaning of the exquisite carvings that lanced that wooden frame , but gazed attentively at them nonetheless , for their beauty was not lost on me in spite of my humble upbringing . Beside the bed an enormous bouquet of no less than one hundred fragrant pink roses stood placidly in an oversize vase that had been set on the bedside table . And , upon my word , from that day forward I was never to enter my chamber of an evening without finding an equally remarkable display of freshly cut flowers beside the bed . The bedding was every bit as magnificent as everything else I had feasted my eyes on that day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped between the sumptuous silken sheets . It was such a pleasurable feeling that I was momentarily tempted to remove my nightdress . Instead , I ran my hand slowly across the bedding . My senses were rapidly becoming engulfed in exotic sensations amidst the influence of such luxury . I was startled out of my enchantment suddenly when there came a light rapping on the door of my chamber . " Who 's there ? " I inquired , sitting up and clutching the silk sheets about my neck . " It is only I , your servant , the Beast , " came the gentle reply . His manner was as reassuring and appealing to me as his appearance was frightful . " Do come in , " I said , more at ease . The Beast opened the door to my bedchamber but did not step over the threshold . Through the dim light of the hallway , I could clearly see his physical outline , which would have been terrifying if not for his gentlemanly demeanor . I waited for him to speak . " I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , remaining just outside the doorway . " Satisfactory ? " I echoed , suddenly amused . " Good heavens , no ! I would never in my wildest imaginings have dared to describe these accommodations as ' satisfactory . " I smiled happily at my little joke , as I flung the extravagant bedclothes aside , and reached toward the nightstand to light the lantern . The Beast remained silent and stared at me as if stunned . Upon seeing his expression , I realized my flippant reply must have insulted him and immediately tried to put matters right . " Oh , Beast ! What I meant to say ... well , of course every thing is quite satisfactory . Why , it is more than satisfactory ! That is what I meant of course . " But something was terribly wrong . It was as if the Beast had not even heard me . Without thinking I leaped from my bed to approach him as I made another effort to explain . But I only managed a few steps before freezing in horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock and disbelief . It was impossible ! And yet , his eyes had a most unnatural glow . He stood perfectly still , like an animal that is poised for an attack . " Beast ? " I whispered , as much a plea as a question . And then all of a sudden he was gone . I stood there many moments afterward , trying to collect my shattered wits . I glanced down at my trembling hands , and it was then that I noticed my dressing gown . It was completely sheer , from head to foot ! The lantern I had lit only served to emphasize my nakedness beneath the cloth ! I did not see the Beast again until suppertime the following day . There , he was as gentle and refined as I had remembered him being at the previous meal we had shared . I blushed and shivered whenever his eyes met mine , but he never gave any indication that he noticed , or that anything had transpired that warranted such an attitude . His demeanor eventually lulled me out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease , and even enjoying his conversation and friendly manner . Afterward , he stood up and asked me the same question he had asked on the previous night , and the one he would ask every night thereafter . " Beauty , will you marry me ? " To which I always replied , " No , Beast . " Our friendship blossomed . And yet , every noise I heard from within my bedchamber at night would leave me anxious and sleepless , waiting breathlessly for that light tap on my chamber door . But the Beast never ventured near my bedchamber again . It was I who , unable to sleep one evening , stumbled across the Beast 's private chamber while wandering toward the library in search of something to read . I heard a noise , much like a groan , coming from the other side of his door as I passed . I stopped abruptly . In a moment or two I heard the noise again . I knew immediately it was the Beast and was seized with compassion for him . Was he ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moments passed and I knocked again . " Go away , " I heard the Beast say at last , in a pleading tone . " I shall not , " I replied determinedly , " not until I have seen that you are well . " Silence again . " Please , " I implored , knocking again . " Just open the door and let me ... " " Go away from that door , Beauty ! " the Beast commanded harshly . " Leave now or you will endanger yourself ! " His tone was controlled , but his voice was desperate . I have wondered many times why I did not leave him then . I have told myself that I could not leave a friend in need . I have told myself that it was my curiosity that would not let me leave . I have told myself a great many things , but I suspect that you will not believe them , either . I turned the doorknob and opened the door to the Beast 's private bedchamber . It was pitch-black inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness for the Beast . The door behind me suddenly slammed shut . The hair on my neck stood up . The darkness was slowly giving way to shadows . My eyes scanned the massive room frantically , seeking the Beast 's form . Suddenly I heard the shrill screech of metal rings on rods , nearly causing me to jump out of my skin , as one heavy velvet drape was yanked aside so that the bright moonlight could enter the chamber . Now I could see the Beast clearly as he approached me . I could also suddenly hear his irregular breathing , and I realized he was panting . My own breathing became more rapid as I desperately struggled to get enough air into my lungs . It was as if the huge chamber had shrunk to half its size upon my discovering the Beast 's large form . Fear was steadily trickling through my veins , infusing me with an acute awareness of everything around me . The Beast slowly approached me until he stood so close that I could feel his warm breath on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his stare . He was a full foot and a half , if not more , taller than I , with shoulders that extended a distance of more than three times the size of mine . There was an unnatural glow in his dark eyes . I shivered in spite of the heat I felt coming off him . " If you do n't want your nightdress to be destroyed , remove it now , " the Beast said at last . His tone was matter-of-fact , but his manner was strained , as if he was struggling to maintain control . His voice was gruff , and so deep as to be barely able to transmit human language . His presence engulfed and overwhelmed me . His gaze hypnotized me . His breath burned me . There was nothing that I could perceive remaining of the mild friend I had shared so many suppers with . And yet , as I stared into the Beast 's eyes , mesmerized , a new sensation was rapidly creeping up from deep within me , mingling with the fear . Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
