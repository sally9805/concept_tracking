Why do Americans have to do all the heavy lifting ? That 's the refrain of every U.S. policymaker , wondering why the rest of the world seems to be waiting for the U.S. economy to pull it out of a downturn . And the sentiment is shared by American corporations , which would just love to find a growing international market for their products . But Western Europe continues to disappoint , and Japan 's recession seems endless . What 's an exporter to do ? <P> How about : look past Japan to the rest of East Asia . During the early and mid-1990s , tigers like South Korea , Singapore , Taiwan and Hong Kong , plus the fast-growing cubs of Indonesia , Thailand , Malaysia and the Philippines , posted some of the best growth rates in the world . The " Asian miracle " drew capital even from banks and factory owners in the U.S. hinterlands . Then came the financial crisis of 1997 , and the story turned sour . But after a recent reporting trip through Asia , I 'm convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To understand why , it 's important to remember what made the miracle happen . At the root of the Asian economic success were two decades of robust export performance , much helped by undervalued currencies . ( It was when the U.S. dollar , to which many local currencies were pegged , started to rise in the mid- ' 90s that systemic weaknesses in the Asian economies became apparent . ) But " outward orientation , " as the academics called it , was n't the whole story . Domestic demand grew rapidly too . Two components of Asian domestic economies were particularly important . First , there was construction , which remade the skylines of every city from Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai . Seven of the world 's 10 tallest buildings are in East Asia . Second , there was consumer spending , as a new middle class flocked to shopping malls to buy fancy electronics and designer labels . For a while it was easier to find a Prada or a Gucci store in Hong Kong and Singapore than in New York or London . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending to property speculators , coupled with a steep increase in unemployment . Consumers kept their hands in their pockets , the designer fashion stores left town , and magazines ran pictures of empty shopping malls . Such recovery as Asia saw in the late ' 90s was almost exclusively explained by an increase in net exports , helped along by newly devalued currencies . So when the growth in world trade screeched to a halt at the end of 2000 , so did the Asian recovery . <P> But the picture has changed . In some interesting recent research , the Asian-economics team at HSBC has found that domestic consumption is running ahead of exports as a source of growth in South Korea , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines and Thailand . In Taiwan , HSBC estimates , private-consumption expenditure , which grew just 1.4% last year , will post a more respectable 3.8% growth in 2002 . Moreover , construction is booming in Thailand and South Korea . Some countries  --  notably South Korea , whose forecast growth of more than 6% this year makes it the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending , and others are pumping up demand with public expenditure . But the key driver of the recovery is easy money . Interest rates remain low , credit demand is up , and banks  --  the best of which have cleaned up their loan portfolios  --  are feeling generous again .
