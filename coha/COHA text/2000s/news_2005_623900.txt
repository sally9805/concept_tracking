<p> On Sundays , a wave of people  --  excited families pushing baby strollers , grandparents , young executives  --  with the luxury of time and money sweeps into the ancient Forbidden City to discover Chinese history . <p> They pose giddily for pictures in rented robes recalling the Ming Dynasty emperors and later snap up kitschy " Maomorabilia " to take home . <p> They jam nearby restaurants , enjoying mounds of pastel colored tapioca , steaming bowls of soup , custom made cream puffs , and yes , Kentucky Fried Chicken and Starbucks coffee . <p> And on Mondays , most of this vast army goes back to work : making money , making history and in many cases making the products that fill the all-consuming hunger of the American consumer . <p> With his six-day mission to China this past week , California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger highlighted what is already obvious to half the world : that whether they are part of the increasing hoard of young , up-and-coming business people or the millions of worker bees laboring in abject conditions for a pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what is fast becoming the business world 's official " Place to Be . " <p> This totalitarian nation is churning out the stuff of our capitalist dreams  --  the luxurious lingerie , suits and evening gowns we wear , the components for iPods we listen to , the technology and cell phones we depend upon , the toys our children ca n't live without . <p> If the major cities in China  --  Beijing , Shanghai and Hong Kong  --  reverberate with a feeling today , it is this : People here are in a race to the top ; and time is on their side . <p> Author Ted Fishman , who wrote , " China Inc. , " a study of the new global market , said the sheer volume and clout of a nation with 1.3 billion workers , consumers and entrepreneurs made it nearly inevitable that China would seize  --  in our lifetime  --  America 's long-held throne as the seat of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit . <p> " Certainly , if any country is going to supplant the United States in the world marketplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he noted , Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs " has already advised Americans to prepare for a world where by the year 2050 , China 's economy could well be 75 percent bigger than their own . " <p> That is why , in China , sometimes the bar scene in " Star Wars " comes to mind  --  as a mix of business people of varied cultures come to smoke , drink and deal in fancy hotel lobbies , creating the unmistakable sensation that this is the time , and place , to strike it rich . <p> " It 's the Wild , Wild East , " said Hal Josephson , who heads MediaSense , a Silicon Valley based consulting group that helps American firms navigate the complexities of business in China . " It feels like Silicon Valley in the ' 90s . ... China is the place to be . " <p> Even the world-wise Schwarzenegger appeared stunned after striding through China 's biggest steel plant in Shanghai . In his trips around that city  --  where triple-decker thoroughfares and floating magnetic trains snake around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there were different governmental systems at work , California can take some lessons from the Chinese ability to get things done , and fast . <p> " It inspires me when you look around here , " Schwarzenegger said , " because you see the freeways on the bottom , and you see the freeways on the top . " But California , sometimes , is " still operating like in the ' 80s . " <p> " By the time you get anything built in California , it will take years to get it finished , " he said . " By that time , you have another 2 million people . " <p> The hunger to do , to make , to make money , is evident everywhere in China 's big cities . In the eye-opening elegance of the city 's five-star hotels , lobbies are packed , morning to night , with clusters of mostly men in dark gray suits , talking earnestly about agreements , shipments , possibilities . <p> In the crowded restaurants , people are haggling over steamed spiny lobsters as big as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street in the jumble of markets stocked with knockoffs , scarves and silk pajamas , visitors get the rush of the wild ride of business negotiations . Sellers start with prices in the heavens , but with cajoling , humor and rapid-fire finger-work on calculators , usually end up accepting a fraction of that , and both sides come away happy . <p> Sometimes , the pace is so fast that even the locals wonder if it 's all too much , and too soon . <p> " Some other country , like America ... everything is step by step , " said film superstar and action hero Jackie Chan this past week . " But China , suddenly in 40 years : Boom ! You can see people on bicycles with a cell phone . You can see people driving a Rolls-Royce with terrible shoes . They do n't know how to match  --  but they 're rich . It 's growing too fast . " <p> Chan , who , with Schwarzenegger , filmed a public service announcement against video piracy , said that in business in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his country would almost certainly surpass the United States ' growth . <p> " We have 1.3 billion people ... it is a big market , " he said . " The American box office , for the past nine months , going down , going down . Look at China box office : Always up ... and we open only in four , five cities is all . " <p> No wonder the people who define culture , art and what 's hip are flocking to China to do business . Fashion designers , whose industry has been long dominated by Paris and New York , are making flights to China 's capitals , inspired by the brilliant colors , the ethnic costumes , the fresh " Shanghaise " silks and " Chinese fusion " styles . <p> " We 're looking to start selling in China , " said California-based couture designer Kevan Hall , whose elegant outfits are worn by stars such as Felicity Huffman of " Desperate Housewives . " <p> These days , he added , " 110 percent of the people who are buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known designer Max Azria agrees the Chinese have shown " wonderful initiative ... a wonderful way to drive the business . " <p> By the end of their six-day , three-city whirlwind trade mission with the governor , many of California 's business people said they felt they were experiencing a unique place and time in business . <p> " There 's a real excitement to it  --  you feel energized , " said Janet Lamkin , president and CEO of the California Bankers Association , representing 280 state banks that want to stake a claim to Chinese business . Standing at the elegant Shanghai Theatre , where the monied locals prepared to see the national film premiere of " Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , " Lamkin said China was the definition of " a very innovative environment . " <p> Terry MacRea , who heads the San Francisco-based Hornblower Yachts , said admiringly of the Chinese entrepreneurs : " I do n't think it 's a gene ; I think it 's a culture . " <p> " There 's 1.3 billion people here , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're hungrier . " <p> Mike Faulkner , president of Nimbus Water , an Oceanside ( San Diego County ) firm selling its California Cool fruit-flavored carbonated drinks in Shanghai , said the sensation was sometimes overwhelming . <p> " It 's like having kids , " he laughs , throwing up his hands . " There 's great excitement  --  but it 's also : ' Oh my God , I never thought of that . ' " <p> Schwarzenegger , wrapping up his trip , said China 's growth would sweep others along . <p> " They 're so fast growing that they have to create 14 million jobs a year  --  new jobs , 14 million ! " he marveled . " And so they have to build and build and build . They 're on automatic pilot . Where it 's going to stop is really the question . " <p> The governor said California businesses could gain a share of that growth if they moved aggressively . <p> " They need certain things we have to offer ... and I think the challenge is  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... be in their face and say , ' look , we have this for you ... we can help you with this , we can help you with that , ' " Schwarzenegger said . " And then to sit down , and to follow up . " A woman cheers in Hong Kong 's Victoria Park Saturday as Gov .
