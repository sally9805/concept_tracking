The Comet W. E. B. Du Bois ( 1920 ) He stood a moment on the steps of the bank , watching the human river that swirled down Broadway . Few noticed him . Few ever noticed him save in a way that stung . He was outside the world " nothing ! " as he said bitterly . Bits of the words of the walkers came to him . " The comet ? " " The comet " Everybody was talking of it . Even the president , as he entered , smiled patronizingly at him , and asked : " Well , Jim , are you scared ? " " No , " said the messenger shortly . " I thought wed journeyed through the comets tail once , " broke in the junior clerk affably . " Oh , that was Haleys , " said the president . " This is a new comet , quite a stranger , they saywonderful , wonderful ! I saw it last night . Oh , by the way , Jim , " turning again to the messenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaults today . " The messenger followed the president silently . Of course , they wanted him to go down to the lower vaults . It was too dangerous for more valuable men . He smiled grimly and listened . " Everything of value has been moved out since the water began to seep in , " said the president , " but we miss two volumes of old records . Suppose you nose around down thereit isnt very pleasant , I suppose . " " Not very , " said the messenger , as he walked out . " Well , Jim , the tail of the new comet hits us at noon this time , " said the vault clerk , as he passed over the keys ; but themessenger passed silently down the stairs . Down he went beneath Broadway , where the dim light filtered through the feet of hurrying men ; down to the dark basement beneath ; down into the blackness and silence beneath that lowest cavern . Here with his dark lantern he groped in the bowels of the earth , under the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last great iron door and stepped into the fetid slime within . Here at last was peace , and he groped moodily forward . A great rat leaped past him and cobwebs crept across his face . He felt carefully around the room , shelf by shelf , on the muddied floor , and in crevice and corner . Nothing . Then he went back to the far end , where somehow the wall felt different . He pounded and pushed and pried . Nothing . He started away . Then something brought him back . He was pounding and working again when suddenly the whole black wall swung as on mighty hinges , and blackness yawned beyond . He peered in ; it was evidently a secret vaultsome hiding place of the old bank unknown in newer times . He entered hesitatingly . It was a long , narrow room with shelves , and at the far end , an old iron chest . On a high shelf lay two volumes of records , and others . He put them carefully aside and stepped to the chest . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the vast and old-fashioned lock and flashed his light on the hinges . They were deeply incrusted with rust . Looking about , he found a bit of iron and began to pry . The rust had eaten a hundred years , and it had gone deep . Slowly , wearily , the old lid lifted , and with a last , low groan lay bare its treasureand he saw the dull sheen of gold ! " Boom ! " A low , grinding , reverberating crash struck upon his ear . He started up and looked about . All was black and still . He groped for his light and swung it about him . Then he knew ! The great stone door had swung to . He forgot the gold and looked death squarely in the face . Then with a sigh he went methodically to work . The cold sweat stood on his forehead ; but he searched , pounded , pushed , and worked until after what seemed endless hours his hand struck a cold bit of metal and the great door swung again harshly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy , stopped . He had just room to squeeze through . There lay the body of the vault clerk , cold and stiff . He stared at it , and then felt sick and nauseated . The air seemed unaccountably foul , with a strong , peculiar odor . He stepped forward , clutched at the air , and fell fainting across the corpse . * * * He awoke with a sense of horror , leaped from the body , and groped up the stairs , calling to the guard . The watchman sat as if asleep , with the gate swinging free . With one glance at him the messenger hurried up to the sub-vault . In vain he called to the guards . His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly . Up into the great basement he rushed . Here another guard lay prostrate on his face , cold and still . A fear arose in the messengers heart . He dashed up to the cellar floor , up into the bank . The stillness of death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed , bent , and stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced about . He was not a man easily moved ; but the sight was appalling ! " Robbery and murder , " he whispered slowly to himself as he saw the twisted , oozing mouth of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk . Then a new thought seized him : If they found him here alonewith all this money and all these dead menwhat would his life be worth ? He glanced about , tiptoed cautiously to a side door , and again looked behind . Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into Wall Street . How silent the street was ! Not a soul was stirring , and yet it was high noonWall Street ? Broadway ? He glanced almost wildly up and down , then across the street , and as he looked , a sickening horror froze in his limbs . With a choking cry of utter fright he lunged , leaned giddily against the cold building , and stared helplessly at the sight . In the great stone doorway a hundred men and women and children lay crushed and twisted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse in a canas if in one wild , frantic rush to safety , they had crushed and ground themselves to death . Slowly the messenger crept along the walls , trying to comprehend , stilling the tremor in his limbs and the rising terror in his heart . He met a business man , silk-hatted and frock-coated , who had crept , too , along that smooth wall and stood now stone dead with wonder written on his lips . The messenger turned his eyes hastily away and sought the curb . A woman leaned wearily against the signpost , her head bowed motionless on her lace and silken bosom . Before her stood a streetcar , silent , and withinbut the messenger but glanced and hurried on . A grimy newsboy sat in the gutter with the " last edition " in his uplifted hand : " Danger ! " screamed its black headlines . " Warnings wired around the world . The Comets tail sweeps past us at noon . Deadly gases expected . Close doors and windows . Seek the cellar . " The messenger read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl lay with gasping face and sleevelets on her arms . On a store step sat a little , sweet-faced girl looking upward toward the skies , and in the carriage by her laybut the messenger looked no longer . The cords gave waythe terror burst in his veins , and with one great , gasping cry he sprang desperately forward and ranran as only the frightened run , shrieking and fighting the air until with one last wail of pain he sank on the grass of Madison Square and lay prone and still . When he arose , he gave no glance at the still and silent forms on the benches , but , going to a fountain , bathed his face ; then hiding himself in a corner away from the drama of death , he quietly gripped himself and thought the thing through : The comet had swept the earth and this was the end . Was everybody dead ? He must search and see . He knew that he must steady himself and keep calm , or he would go insane . First he must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famous hostelry and entered its gorgeous , ghost-haunted halls . He beat back the nausea , and , seizing a tray from dead hands , hurried into the street and ate ravenously , hiding to keep out the sights . " Yesterday , they would not have served me , " he whispered , as he forced the food down . Then he started up the streetlooking , peering , telephoning , ringing alarms ; silent , silent all . Was nobodynobodyhe dared not think the thought and hurried on . Suddenly he stopped still . He had forgotten . My God ! How could he have forgotten ? He must rush to the subwaythen he almost laughed . Noa car ; if he could find a Ford . He saw one . Gently he lifted off its burden , and took his place on the seat . He tested the throttle . There was gas . He glided off , shivering , and drove up the street . Everywhere stood , leaned , lounged , and lay the dead , in grim and awful silence . On he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with a gay party whose smiles yet lingered on their death-struck lips ; on , past crowds and groups of cars , pausing by dead policemen ; at 42nd Street he had to detour to Park Avenue to avoid the dead congestion . He came back on Fifth Avenue at 57th and flew past the Plaza and by the park with its hushed babies and silent throng , until as he was rushing past 72nd Street he heard a sharp cry , and saw a living form leaning wildly out an upper window . He gasped . The human voice sounded in his ears like the voice of God . " Hellohellohelp , in Gods name ! " wailed the woman . " Theres a dead girl in here and a man andand see yonder dead men lying in the street and dead horsesfor the love of God go and bring the officers " the words trailed off into hysterical tears . He wheeled the car in a sudden circle , running over the still body of a child and leaping on the curb . Then he rushed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a long pause , but at last the heavy door swung back . They stared a moment in silence . She had not noticed before that he was a Negro . He had not thought of her as white . She was a woman of perhaps twenty-fiverarely beautiful and richly gowned , with darkly-golden hair , and jewels . Yesterday , he thought with bitterness , she would scarcely have looked at him twice . He would have been dirt beneath her silken feet . She stared at him . Of all the sorts of men she had pictured as coming to her rescue she had not dreamed of one like him . Not that he was not human , but he dwelt in a world so far from hers , so infinitely far , that he seldom even entered her thought . Yet as she looked at him curiously he seemed quite commonplace and usual . He was a tall , dark workingman of the better class , with a sensitive face trained to stolidity and a poor mans clothes and hands . His face was soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like fires long banked , but not out . So a moment each paused and gauged the other ; then the thought of the dead world without rushed in and they started toward each other . " What has happened ? " she cried . " Tell me ! Nothing stirs . All is silence ! I see the dead strewn before my window as winnowed by the breath of Godand see " She dragged him through great , silken hangings to where , beneath the sheen of mahogany and silver , a little French maid lay stretched in quiet , everlasting sleep , and near her a butler lay prone in his livery . The tears streamed down the womans cheeks , and she clung to his arm until the perfume of her breath swept his face and he felt the tremors racing through her body . " I had been shut up in my dark room developing pictures of the comet which I took last night ; when I came outI saw the dead ! " What has happened ? " she cried again . He answered slowly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dead ! " " Many ? Very many ? " " I have searched and I have seen no other living soul but you . " She gasped and they stared at each other . " Myfather ! " she whispered . " Where is he ? " " He started for the office . " " Where is it ? " " In the Metropolitan Tower . " " Leave a note for him here and come . " Then he stopped . " No , " he said firmly , " first , we must goto Harlem . " " Harlem ! " she cried . Then she understood . She tapped her foot at first impatiently . She looked back and shuddered . Then she came resolutely down the steps . " Theres a swifter car in the garage in the court , " she said . " I do nt know how to drive it , " he said . " I do , " she answered . In ten minutes they were flying to Harlem on the wind . The Stutz rose and raced like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two wheels and slipped with a shriek into 135th . He was gone but a moment . Then he returned , and his face was gray . She did not look , but said : " You have lostsomebody ? " " I have losteverybody , " he said simply , " unless " He ran back and was gone several minuteshours they seemed to her . " Everybody , " he said , and he walked slowly back with something film-like in his hand , which he stuffed into his pocket . " Im afraid I was selfish , " he said . But already the car was moving toward the park among the dark and lined dead of Harlemthe brown , still faces , the knotted hands , the homely garments , and the silencethe wild and haunting silence . Out of the park , and down Fifth Avenue they whirled . In and out among the dead they slipped and quivered , needing no sound of bell or horn , until the great , square Metropolitan Tower hovered in sight . Gently he laid the dead elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the office stood open . On the threshold lay the stenographer , and , staring at her , sat the dead clerk . The inner office was empty , but a note lay on the desk , folded and addressed but unsent : Dear Daughter : Ive gone for a hundred-mile spin in Freds new Mercedes . Shall not be back before dinner . Ill bring Fred with me . J. B. H. " Come , " she cried nervously . " We must search the city . " Up and down , over and across , back againon went that ghostly search . Everywhere was silence and deathdeath and silence ! They hunted from Madison Square to Spuyten Duyvel ; they rushed across the Williamsburg Bridge ; they swept over Brooklyn ; from the Battery and Morningside Heights they scanned the river . Silence , silence everywhere , and no human sign . Haggard and bedraggled they puffed a third time slowly down Broadway , under the broiling sun , and at last stopped . He sniffed the air . An odora smelland with the shifting breeze a sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl settled back helplessly in her seat . " What can we do ? " she cried . It was his turn now to take the lead , and he did it quickly . " The long distance telephonethe telegraph and the cablenight rockets and then flight ! " She looked at him now with strength and confidence . He did not look like men , as she had always pictured men ; but he acted like one and she was content . In fifteen minutes they were at the central telephone exchange . As they came to the door he stepped quickly before her and pressed her gently back as he closed it . She heard him moving to and fro , and knew his burdensthe poor , little burdens he bore . When she entered , he was alone in the room . The grim switchboard flashed its metallic face in cryptic , sphinx-like immobility . She seated herself on a stool and donned the bright earpiece . She looked at the mouthpiece . She had never looked at one so closely before . It was wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sarcastic in its unfeeling curves . It lookedshe beat back the thoughtbut it lookedit persisted in looking likeshe turned her head and found herself alone . One moment she was terrified ; then she thanked him silently for his delicacy and turned resolutely , with a quick intaking of breath . " Hello ! " she called in low tones . She was calling to the world . The world must answer . Would the world answer ? Was the world Silence ! She had spoken too low . " Hello ! " she cried , full-voiced . She listened . Silence ! Her heart beat quickly . She cried in clear , distinct , loud tones : " Hellohellohello ! " What was that whirring ? Surelynowas it the click of a receiver ? She bent close , moved the pegs in the holes , and called and called , until her voice rose almost to a shriek , and her heart hammered . It was as if she had heard the last flicker of creation , and the evil was silence . Her voice dropped to a sob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthpiece , and the thought came again . Hope lay dead within her . Yes , the cable and the rockets remained ; but the worldshe could not frame the thought or say the word . It was too mightytoo terrible ! She turned toward the door with a new fear in her heart . For the first time she seemed to realize that she was alone in the world with a stranger , with something more than a strangerwith a man alien in blood and cultureunknown , perhaps unknowable . It was awful ! She must escapeshe must fly ; he must not see her again . Who knew what awful thoughts he had ? She gathered her silken skirts deftly about her young , smooth limbslistened , and glided into a sidehall . A moment she shrank back : the hall lay filled with dead women ; then she leaped to the door and tore at it , with bleeding fingers , until it swung wide . She looked out . He was standing at the top of the alleysilhouetted , tall and black , motionless . Was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not care . She simply leaped and ranran until she found herself alone amid the dead and the tall ramparts of towering buildings . She stopped . She was alone . Alone ! Alone on the streetsalone in the cityperhaps alone in the world ! There crept in upon her the sense of deceptionof creeping hands behind her backof silent , moving things she could not seeof voices hushed in fearsome conspiracy . She looked behind and sideways , started at strange sounds and heard still stranger , until every nerve within her stood sharp and quivering , stretched to scream at the barest touch . She whirled and flew back , whimpering like a child , until she found that narrow alley again and the dark , silent figure silhouetted at the top . She stopped and rested ; then she walked silently toward him , looked at him timidly ; but he said nothing as he handed her into the car . Her voice caught as she whispered : " Notthat . " And he answered slowly : " Nonot that ! " They climbed into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great , dry , quivering sobs , as they flew toward the cable office on the east side , leaving the world of wealth and prosperity for the world of poverty and work . In the world behind them were death and silence , grave and grim , almost cynical , but always decent ; here it was hideous . It clothed itself in every ghastly form of terror , struggle , hate , and suffering . It lay wreathed in crime and squalor , greed and lust . Only in its dread and awful silence was it like to death everywhere . Yet as the two , flying and alone , looked upon the horror of the world , slowly , gradually , the sense of all-enveloping death deserted them . They seemed to move in a world silent and asleepnot dead . They moved in quiet reverence , lest somehow they wake these sleeping forms who had , at last , found peace . They moved in some solemn , world-wide Friedho above which some mighty arm had waved its magic wand . All nature slept untiluntil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into each others eyeshe , ashen , and she , crimson , with unspoken thought . To both , the vision of a mighty beautyof vast , unspoken things , swelled in their souls ; but they put it away .
