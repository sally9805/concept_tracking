How to close the season : <p> Fall is not a dead time of the year ! It 's busier than any other season . Here are some things to do to close the gardening season and get ready to open a new one next year . <p> Lawncare : You can say a friendly hello to the world with a well kept lawn . Even the proverbial red carpet can not be more inviting than the green carpet provided by a neat , healthy lawn around your front door steps . It serves as a welcome mat for you , your family , and your guests . It makes for a pleasant sight for passersby . It beautifies your grounds . It adds to the appeal and to the value of your home . Caution : Do n't be a slave to it ! <p> Bare spots in lawns come about for several reasons : Perhaps the seed was planted too deeply or not deep enough . Or , it was washed or blown away . Young seedlings may have died from the lack of water or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the sprouts . Or , the soil is starved and needs plant food . The best time for reseeding bare spots is the fall . <p> Weeds do not make a lawn poor ; a poor lawn makes weeds . A well nourished soil thickly covered with healthy , vigorous , frequently sowed grass offers little hospitality to weed seeds . They can not thrive in the shade of flourishing grass which gives them more competition than they can survive . What 's more , growing weeds find it most repugnant to have a lawn mower clip them and snip off their seed heads with annoying regularity . A lawn mower is a formidable enemy of weeds . <p> Weeds flourish best in soil too impoverished to play host to healthy grass , or when grass has become sparse enough for weed seeds to gain a foothold without competition from grass . Mow the lawn closer in the fall . Do n't let tall grass go into the winter . Start with a good seed mixture . <p> The Vegetable Garden : Dig up beets and wash them off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beets in a plastic bag and keep in the refrigerator . Try baking a few beets in the oven ! Yum ! Yum ! Yum ! <p> Carrots can be stored in sawdust in a cool cellar . A little freeze enhances the flavor . You can also leave carrots in the garden to dig up during the winter if you cover them with a foot of straw held down by boards . You can also store carrots in a plastic bag kept in the refrigerator . <p> Dig up some clumps of parsley and grow in a bright window . Start some from seed and get fresh parsley all winter . <p> Fall is a good time to add manure to your garden . Yes , people still use manure . It 's more expensive than milk . Do not add fresh manure to the garden immediately before planting or when the plants are growing . The high nitrogen in the manure can burn the young plants . <p> Apply the manure in the fall and till it in or let the fall rain and winter snow " tame " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh manure . Manure has played an integral role in food growing for thousands of years and continues to be a valuable soil additive in the organic garden . <p> In recent years , however , a virulent new strain of E. coli bacteria has shown up in some animal manure . People have become seriously ill and have even died . Children are particularly susceptible . Our advice is that manure can be safely used on food gardens if it is first fully composted and/or not applied anytime sooner than 120 days before harvest . <p> Flowers and Plants . Cut peonies to three inches from the ground . Do n't bother to mulch the peony bed . If your buds failed to open ( stayed the size of a marble ) , place the cut tops in a bag and haul them to the landfill . They are peppered with botrytis blight , a fungal problem . <p> Fall is a good time to prune and transplant roses and other flowering shrubs , and that means you can give them a slight amount of pruning at these times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are apt to wilt , and next season , there 'll be more dead growth to remove , so a safe rule is to thin out about 1/3 of the top whenever a bush is transplanted . You 'll help the plant along by doing so . <p> Most gardeners hate to do any pruning at planting time . Pruning is important as many varieties of shrubs are dormant and will not make proper growth the first season , unless severely pruned . Remove about 1/4 of the top growth of the shrub at planting time . Thereafter , pruning can be done to remove old wood and keep the plant the right size . <p> Fall and bulbs also go together . Pick up a bulb catalog and study it . New varieties are good , but so are the old varieties . <p> If your bulbs have n't been divided , do it now . Plant some new ones for a greater show in the spring . Mix them or plant them in clumps . Bulbs can go every three years before dividing . <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Overcrowding is a main reason for lack of blooms . If all that comes up from a bulb is a large leaf and not bloom stalk , then your bulbs should be dug and separated . A lack of phosphorus is also a factor . Mix in some plant food . <p> If you want to " force " tulips for indoor blooms next year , put tulip bulbs in a pot in the fall . Three bulbs in a six-inch pot is OK . Water well and store them in a cold dark place for eight to 10 weeks . Dig a trench and bury them in the garden . Cover with sawdust to keep out frost . Absolute darkness in a cold temperature is needed during this period to insure root growth . After 10 weeks , bring gradually to light and heat , always avoiding overheated rooms . Put pots in partial light for a week at 60 F. Then place pots in a sunny window and water as needed . <p> The tulips you receive from the florists can be dried off after blooming and planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment as tulips . <p> Many outdoor plants can be moved indoors for a winter show . Geraniums are the most important outdoor plants for indoor growing . You can start new ones from seeds or cuttings , or you can cut them back . Pot them up and grow them as house plants . You 'll get bushels of blooms at winter . <p> For our free guide , How to Keep Geraniums Over the Winter , send a self-addressed , stamped envelope to The Green Thumb ; P.O. Box 579 ; Naples , NY 14512 . It could save you money next spring . <p> Fall 's a good time to plant or transplant perennials . Give them a good soaking after your plant time . Cut their tops back about halfway . You may want to mulch them with evergreen bough , but wait till the ground freezes then apply the mulch . <p> Before the snow flies , mix up a batch of potting soil . Some store soils are pure muck , very bad for houseplants and starting seeds . Many of them are " fluffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their fibrous structure has been broken down and that is why we recommend adding perlite , at least one third by volume . <p> Some potting mixes contain high-salt fertilizers . Furthermore , when the mixes are stored in bags , they are apt to heat up due to the activity of microorganisms , which results in salt production . Thus you get two " shots " of salts . <p> There are as many recipes for soil mixes as there are gardeners . Whatever you do , do n't use any garden soil in the mixture for starting seeds unless you sterilize it first . It 's okay to use some in a mix for growing houseplants , however . A mix of equal parts sand , peat moss , garden loam , and perlite ( or vermiculite ) makes a good houseplant potting soil . We mention this one because a good many old-timers still want to use a bit of garden soil to give " backbone " to the mix . <p> Fall is also good time to gather materials for dried arrangements . So go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cones , etc. to make dried arrangements for winter bouquets . <p> Clean up the dead plants and compost them . Start a compost pile of leaves , dead plants , and grass clippings . Compost furnishes organic matter . It is the backbone of any soil . <p> Trees . Fall is one time when you have to be a butcher and not a barber when pruning . Be brutal and give neglected trees a good corrective pruning job . It will bring the tree back into normal production . You may need a chain saw to cut the big limbs , but it will be worth the effort . ( Peach trees are the exception and should be pruned in May or April . ) <p> There is no reason to rush this corrective pruning of old trees . It may be done over a period of several years . Severe pruning may result in excessive , new , inner , upright growth from limbs forming additional " water sprouts " or " suckers . " Any such shoots , either from limbs or the base of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees require less pruning and should not have more than about one-tenth of their wood removed at one time . Plums also require fairly light annual pruning . Cherries need mainly thinning to improve light penetration . <p> Note : Heavy pruning on neglected trees may result in reduced or no fruit production for the first year or two afterward . <p> To many gardeners , pruning evergreens is a complete mystery . Evergreens must be pruned a few minutes each year or they 'll grow out of bounds and make your plantings look like a jungle . Do n't plant them and forget them if you want your landscape investment to be a thing of lasting service and beauty . <p> The best time to prune evergreens is when the new foliage is soft and furry . Actually you can prune any time the shears are sharp . Pruning back the soft growth and the ends of branches of the yews will tend to thicken the foliage growth and prevent the plants from becoming too tall or too wide . <p> Fall is a good time to plant shade trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also bring you pleasure and comfort . Do n't overplant them . A few good shade trees , well placed will give you the best effect . The living room , outdoor terrace or porch are most often used in the afternoon and are in need of shade . A shade tree can eliminate the need for that attic air-conditioner in the summer . <p> New shade trees can be planted as near as 15 feet , an absolute minimum . Twenty five feet is better , and it 's a good idea to keep them at least 40 feet from cesspools , or septic tank lines , if possible . <p> Be sure to keep your trees and shrubs watered before cold weather sets in . <p> By Doc Abraham and Katy Abraham <p> <p> George ( Doc ) and Katy Abraham are CR 's gardening editors . <p>
