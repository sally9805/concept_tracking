<p> Durango - Some places , no matter how often you visit , always offer something new to see - or at least more of the old . This town in the southwestern corner of Colorado is one of those spots . <p> A recent AAA and Travel Industry Association of America survey ranked Colorado as the fifth-most desirable place in the nation to vacation , and listed Durango and nearby Mesa Verde National Park as two of the hot spots this summer . <p> And no one means because of fire . That was two years ago , when fires - including the Missionary Ridge blaze north of Durango , which burned more than 70,000 acres - curtailed visits . <p> The issue this summer , if there is any , is the cost of fuel . But the seven-hour , 335-mile drive from Denver to Durango is considered one of the prettiest in the state , a thought that should ease trauma at the gas pump . <p> Rich in history , Durango is a work in progress , with enough of the old to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new to surprise Coloradans who think they 've seen it all . <p> Upscale shops and galleries are in place , and eateries with linen <p> tablecloths are joining the ones without . <p> While vestiges of the wild and woolly West of yesteryear are periodically evident in the dusty boots , worn jeans and wide-brimmed Stetsons of the occasional cowboy , the surest indication that a new day is dawning is the proliferation of upscale restaurants . <p> Among the newest is Cafe Sari , named for its owner , 30-something Sari ( pronounced " serry , " as in " serenade " ) Seedorf . Her menu reflects a kind of East-meets- South- in-the-West sensibility , with such options as shrimp and cheese grits , buffalo meatloaf , roasted quail , smoked trout , curried lemongrass chicken , pad Thai and Colorado rack of lamb . <p> She 's from Iowa . Her chef , Huy Tran , was born in Vietnam . They met in Charleston , S.C . <p> Make that Midwest meets East in the South and moves West . <p> " Nothing like it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson Hole , Wyo . And before that she taught English as a second language in Mexico . <p> " I fell in love with the mountains , " she says . " And I loved the sunshine . Weather affects my lifestyle . After living in the South for seven years I had a chance to choose where I wanted to live . I 'd heard about Durango , so I came here to check it out . I found this place the third day I was here . Five days later , I moved here . I decided it would be fun to do a place like this because there was nothing like it in the West . " <p> Whether or not they were waiting for grits and gravy to arrive , locals have taken to fried green tomatoes and rmoulade with an enthusiasm that has left Seedorf pleasantly surprised . <p> " I have people come in and only want our cheese grits , " she says . " People told me I was nuts to open a restaurant with cheese grits , andouille sausage and tasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , so to speak . " <p> Another popular new restaurant is Seasons Rotisserie &; Grill , also on Main Street . Lunch on the patio is delightful . The menu is varied , from curry chicken lettuce wraps , grilled halibut and risotto cakes to hoisin-glazed baby back ribs and bison kebobs . <p> The all-too-familiar chain restaurants are here , as well , but why not chow down on what the locals eat . That would include Skinny 's Grill for fajitas , soups , salad and pasta ; Olde Tymer 's Cafe for a burger and beer ; Nature 's Oasis for vegetarian dishes ; or Bread for pastries , cookies and deli sandwiches made on homemade bread . <p> On the lodging scene , old standards in town are two ever-lovely hotels , the General Palmer and the Strater , landmarks unto themselves and well worth at least one visit . Both hotels , in the heart of downtown and within blocks of one another , conjure up a bygone era . Think Victoriana ad infinitum . If you like stained glass , polished brass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The General Palmer , built in 1898 , is the less imposing of the two , but how wrong can you go with a 25-year-old AAA Four-Diamond rating , bedside handmade chocolates and fresh muffins made daily from scratch ? <p> The Palmer 's general manger , Sandy Medearis , originally is from Boulder . She moved to Durango in 1973 to ski and has been here since . She became manager of the Palmer in 1987 . <p> " It was originally called the Savoy , and , until the 1950s , it was privately owned until the Denver &; Rio Grande Railroad line bought it and two other city blocks , " she says . <p> Some in town still call it " Rio Grande Land . " <p> William Jackson Palmer , who founded Colorado Springs , is credited with bringing the narrow-gauge railway to Durango . <p> Opened up the West <p> Originally from Pennsylvania , he commanded a cavalry regiment in the Civil War , spent time in a military prison in Richmond , Va. , under an assumed name , and won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who also is said to be responsible for opening up the American West to previously unimaginable prosperity , is basically a footnote in the memory of most Coloradans , unless they 're train buffs . But remnants of his good taste are evident in the appointments of the hotel that bears his name . <p> The Palmer still has the original elevator - barely large enough to accommodate two people - but gone is the operator . <p> " Palmer 's wife never came to Durango because she refused to go over the mountains , " Medearis says . " But thanks to his passion for putting trains everywhere we have still have the railroad here . " <p> In fact , the famed Durango &; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad is only a half-block from the hotel . The train snakes along 45 miles of track , hugging its mountainside route in the San Juans and offering breathtaking views . <p> If you stay at the Palmer , Meaderis will recommend having dinner at Chez Grand-mere , prepared by its Belgian chef , Michel Poumay . A fixed-price tasting might include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat cheese and vodka , or a tartellette of salmon in a shallot buerre blanc . Striped bass with avocado and shrimp might be a dinner offering , or red snapper with mussels and saffron or medallions of deer with lingonberry sauce . <p> As for Durango 's second historic hotel , the Strater earns its place on the listing of Historic Hotels of the Rockies . Built in 1887 , it is big , imposing and has an extraordinary collection of Victorian furniture . In fact , it boasts having the largest collection of American antique walnut in the world . <p> That may or may not be , but what is extraordinary about the Strater 's woodwork is that to the untrained eye there is no difference between the original sculpted dentils , scroll tops and button rosettes and the ones craftsman Charles Schumacher did . <p> Schumacher , in his mid-70s , has been matching the old and the new for more than a quarter-century . Take a look at the mahogany in the main entrance , or the ornate front desk 's cherry or the walnut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if you can tell the difference . <p> Schumacher continues to do work for the Strater , matching with consummate skill the details of century-old pieces from around the world . Tiffany-style lamps in rooms and gold leaf on ceilings complement his work throughout the hotel . <p> Bellman Jake Hermes is part of a well-informed staff that delight in detailing the Strater 's fine points . Hermes is happy to tell you about the Victorian settee that came from a Meridian , Miss. , plantation ; the carpet from the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas ; President Gerald Ford 's stay ; or the time presidential candidate John F. Kennedy gave a campaign speech at the hotel in 1960 . <p> Train-lover 's dream <p> If you like trains , you 'll love having a second-floor room along Narrow Gauge Street , with its lovely mountain view . As an added bonus , the early morning steam engine whistle , signaling the departure of the Durango &; Silverton Narrow Gauge 's first run , can be your wake-up call . <p> " We have people who ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people as the train pulls out , " Hermes says . " If you love trains , it 's a good place to be .
