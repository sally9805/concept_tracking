Chapter 1 For twenty minutes the policeman sat with the villagers watching the golden frog . As long as the frog did not move , the Indians from the village did not move , and therefore the policeman waited , knowing that there was no need to hurry . If he broke the frog 's spell it might be seen as a bad omen , and so he rested on his haunches , as he remembered doing in his own village many years before . The frog seemed to be growing ever more powerful as it defended the little patch of sunlight that squeezed through the guayacan trees in the ravine . Its ancient wedge-shaped face pointed directly at the policeman , as if he knew that the matter now rested between them . But the frog was in no hurry , either . He was in a paradise of flies . He was sleepy from eating , and the lids bobbed on his gold-slitted black eyes , but he gripped the sides of the large canvas mailbag like a miser clutching his purse . Two human feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the policeman said in a low voice . After a pause the oldest of the men responded , " The boy . He came to fish in the river . " The policeman saw a child half-hidden behind his mother 's dress . " At what time of day ? " " It was evening . " The policeman absorbed the fact that a night and part of the morning had passed before anyone had come to El Roblito to notify him . Perhaps they wanted to own this mystery for a while , before giving it to him . Certainly the frog had not been sitting here all that time . The policeman glanced at his camera and thought about taking photographs of the scene , but then he saw the villagers shift like grass stirring in the slightest breeze , andso he relaxed again into mindlessness . He was scarcely aware of how much time passed before a cloud shadowed the mailbag and the frog leapt into the ferns , but when the villagers abruptly rose to their feet , he understood that he could now go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he tied to bushes and trees in a rough square around the crime scene . This was what the villagers expected , and they nodded approvingly , having seen such actions on television . The policeman took his time . He was alone in this outpost , and he did not feel that he had the authority to order the villagers to leave . Also , he enjoyed making a show of professionalism . He put on rubber gloves and took out a plastic bag from his kit , along with a pair of tweezers . There was a gum wrapper on the ground that he picked up and examined . " Has anyone been down here ? " he asked in general . The Indians looked at one another , and the same old man responded , " No . " The policeman took photographs of the footprints on the edge of the ravine , then walked down to the riverbank to get water for the plaster casts . He knew what the villagers were waiting for , but he also knew that their anticipation was worth savoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tire tracks that the body had been dumped out of a truck with double tires on the back , and already that worried him , because the only such trucks he knew of in the area belonged to the Panama Defense Forces . He did not want to find one of their victims . It was also obvious that the body was meant to be found . There were hundreds of square miles of jungle around them , places few humans had ever passed through , but this village was just across the border of Costa Rica , along a road everyone used . It appeared that the body had been driven across the river and dumped in the nearest ravine . Done quickly but carelessly . With arrogance . This also worried him . Finally the policeman moved through the electric curtain of flies . He looked closely at the weave of the mailbag . There was some printing on the underside that he could just see , so now he touched the bag and felt the sodden heaviness . It took real force to turn the bag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corpse inside were now pointing upward , and the bare , exposed feet were hanging in the air . U.S. MAIL , it said on the bag . The policeman lowered the bag into its original position and sat back on the ferns . Presently , he stood and began to tug roughly at the bag , but the body was stiff and ungainly and did not come loose willingly . He had to grasp one of the legs to work the knees through the opening . He did not like to touch the dead , and he could sense the villagers withdrawing a bit into their own reluctance . It was not like anything else . The hardness of the limbs felt wrong and alien . The hair on the dead man 's legs was repulsive to him , but he could not stop until he had gotten the body out of the bag . His audience was quietly insistent on this . Now that the bloody legs were out , the policeman pulled again on the corners of the mailbag , and he felt the canvas surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the women screamed , but his own thoughts had not yet focused on what he was actually seeing . The wrongness was blinding his senses . And then he understood that the corpse 's head was gone . He did not mean to vomit , it just came out of him , perfectly naturally and spontaneously . He stood gaping in surprise at the sight and at his own violent reaction . Then he came to himself and began to do the things he knew he was expected to do . He took pictures . It helped to see the corpse through the lens ; it was as if he were viewing something in another element , underwater , as it were . The body was covered with purple contusions and deep wounds that were not meant to kill . The genitals were swollen to the size of mangoes . The policeman did not want to think about what the man had endured before death spared him . He knew that he was going to become very drunk tonight . When he had taken enough photos of the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Now he saw something else that he did n't want to see : F-8 was crudely carved into the dead man 's back . The policeman stood . He reached into his evidence bag and took out the gum wrapper , which he dropped back onto the ground . There would be no further investigation . The library of the papal nunciature was a pleasantly formal room , and although the building lacked the most basic tropical appliances  --  central air-conditioning and a dehumidifier  --  the library itself remained remarkably cool and free of mildew , a sanctuary from the steam-bath climate and the unnerving , noisy vitality of Panama City . The library floors were made of Italian marble , and the walls of thick limestone bricks in the classic colonial style . Here is where Monseor Henri-Auguste Morette , the official representative of the Vatican , spent most of his working days . Morette was seventy-one years old , and although he was still hearty and erect , lately he had begun to bend and shrink with age , so that his hatchet nose and great Gallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . His skin  --  so unsuited to the tropics  --  was starkly pale and marbled with blue veins , and his thin , white hair lay close to his skull . All this pallor was in shocking contrast to his shining dark eyes and his riotous , exclamatory black eyebrows , which gave him a look of predatory ferocity . Many vanquished opponents had underestimated Morette 's cunning and resourcefulness . His native talent for intrigue had been sharpened to a fine edge by twelve years of Vatican politics . Within this intimate arena , Archbishop Morette had been a figure of speculation and controversy . His excoriating intelligence and snapping wit set him apart from the bureaucratic herd , and his linguistic skills  --  he was fluent in five languages  --  made him indispensable within the Vatican Secretariat of State . Even his most jealous colleagues had marked him as a future member of the College of Cardinals , while conspiring to limit his influence . In the end , however , it was Morette who brought himself down , through a turn of events that would otherwise have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the powerful  --  and much feared  --  Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which at that time was conducting a purge of freethinking theologians , particularly Latin American liberationists . It was a job he attacked with characteristic vigor . At his hand , many of the finest priests in the church were expelled or humiliated into submission . Morette personally took no position on the great doctrinal battle in which he played one of the leading roles . It was not his task to debate theology , only to implement policy . Gradually , however , he began to notice the change in the expressions of his colleagues when he entered a room or sat at the table with them for dinner . They were afraid of him . Some hated him . He could see them struggling to be civil . There was a penalty to be paid for serving his office so efficiently . Morette recognized the forces that were being arrayed against him , and recognized that his own position was becoming increasingly hopeless . He would be sacrificed . Like a marauding knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he would be taken . In the larger game it was a tactical necessity . The attack came in the form of a whispering campaign . His faith was called into question . This did not surprise him . He had never been pious . He quickly made a confession of his loss of faith and was sent to a kind of spiritual rehabilitation center on the southern coast of Sicily . When he returned to Rome six months later , his standing was so reduced that he was transferred back to the Secretariat of State , which banished him from the center of power to this remote , rather disgraceful posting . Much like a prisoner facing a lengthy sentence , the Nuncio had arrived in Panama with a crate of books and crossword puzzles in various languages , which he hoped would occupy his years of exile . Included in the crate were thirty-seven volumes of Aquinas . He had told himself that Aquinas was going to be his great pursuit ; he had remembered the Summa theologica as his passion in seminary ; but after forcing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books back on the shelves . In a subversive frame of mind , he then thought of writing his long-postponed , definitive treatise on the history of appearances by the Virgin , but he discovered that he somehow had lost interest in the Marian cult as well . The artifacts of belief seemed only curiosities now ; there was nothing vital there to grip his interest . For long stretches of time , the Nuncio confined himself to his study , watching Mexican soap operas and playing bridge by correspondence . By nature , however , the Nuncio was not a hermit . He was a man of the world . He enjoyed good wine and lively talk . To his surprise and immense pleasure he soon awakened to the fact that both were readily available in this amusing little country to which he had been pocketed . Panamanians rarely took themselves seriously  --  a delightful quality . They were dedicated to pleasure and business and the multilayered intimacy of society . The entire country was Rome all over again , the Nuncio thought , soft and shallow but also beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuncio had come to realize that there were really two Panamas , one of appearances and the other an underworld of secrets . There was , for instance , the nominal Catholicism that most of the country adhered to , and yet behind that mask of orthodoxy there was a primitive and highly inventive spiritualism , which was everywhere  --  the country was steeped in it . The Nuncio could stand on his balcony and see the hand-painted buses rushing past with their vivid depictions of Indian legends and tribal gods . Nearly everyone he met in the country consulted a spiritual guide of some sort  --  an astrologer , a fortune-teller , a voodoo priest . He even knew some nuns who wore amulets around their necks , a practice he tried in vain to stamp out . The Nuncio had the feeling that modernity was a transitory condition in Panama , and that the country 's magical past , like the jungle , was chewing at the margins , always threatening to break through and reclaim the vulnerable campsite of civilization . From his balcony the Nuncio could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the canal . One could follow their wakes as they wobbled shoreward , until the waves crashed against the seawall at the foot of the towering financial district . This was one economy , built on shipping , import-export , duty-free shops , tourism , bananas , and the mighty American military presence . Behind the faade of legitimacy was another , much larger economy , one of numbered bank accounts and laundered drug profits . Smugglers and arms dealers swaggered through the hotel lobbies . Pilots for the drug cartels paraded through the jewelry stores on Via Espaa buying gaudy trinkets with great green rolls of Yanqui dollars . Guerrillas who were engaged in one revolution or another sat at the same gaming tables with Middle Eastern weapons merchants and CIA officers and Colombian cocaine dealers . Like peacock tails , extraordinary fortunes opened themselves for display in the form of fantastic seaside palaces and country retreats . One took care not to inquire too closely about the sources of wealth or to comment on a sudden improvement in a person 's financial status . In such an intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or marriage or both , so it was easy to give offense even to the most decent citizens . Real political life had been smothered by two decades of military dictatorship , which hid behind a counterfeit democracy . There was a congress and a president who came to power through graft and fraud . Indeed , that was the whole point of political office . Most Panamanians accepted this with a shrug or a wink , as if the concept of government was a kind of genial farce , not to be taken seriously . The Nuncio supposed that this fatalism must be a predictable consequence of the artificiality of Panama 's creation . The country had never had the opportunity to fight for its independence ; it had simply been snatched away from Colombia by the Americans and fashioned into a surprised and awkward and wholly unprepared republic . It was no accident that General Noriega had been chief of military intelligence before he made his grab for power . Intelligence was the one commodity everyone traded in this two-faced commonwealth . The Americans had listening posts burrowed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could overhear conversations all over Latin America . Satellites and high-flying aircraft with high-speed lenses patrolled the skies . Antennae studded the mountains like the spines of a hedgehog . But the Americans were by no means the only spies in Panama . The Japanese and the Taiwanese depended on the canal as a lifeline to Europe , so they monitored every political development , spending millions each year to keep their interests alive and their paid lackeys in office . No one could even guess how many Cuban agents and informers there were in the country , not to mention the Mexicans and Colombians and Israelis and Russians and even South Africans . The entire country was like an espionage trade fair . And the Nuncio loved it . He adored the secrecy , the scheming and plotting , the intricate connivings , the hidden meanings that made life in Panama a study in human duplicity . In this , his Vatican training served him well . After ten years in Panama , he had become the most recognized and trusted diplomat in the city , gaining a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities deeply prized in a country that dines on gossip . Many of the Nuncio 's sources were reporters , dissidents , or fallen political figures who had , at various times , come knocking at the back door of the old stone mansion at the corner of Avenida Balboa and Via Italia , where they might wait out the latest government purge . At this very moment the Nuncio was harboring at Vatican expense a columnist for La Prensa as well as two former members of the cabinet who had been there for nearly seven months , draining the wine cellar of many of its finest labels . Aside from his network of political refugees and the deeply guarded but sometimes surprisingly useful information garnered from the confession box , the Nuncio had trained his staff to cultivate sources . Even the nuns brought in useful bits from time to time , rumors picked up from the schoolchildren  --  it was surprising what you could learn about a country by listening to its children  --  or complaints in the marketplace . But the Nuncio 's prize student in the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salvadoran whose talents reminded the Nuncio of himself nearly fifty years ago  --  cool , intelligent , and dispassionate . With training and encouragement , Father Jorge might attain the offices that the Nuncio himself had once aspired to . In fact , it was Father Jorge 's step that the Nuncio recognized echoing in the marble hallway , and presently the handsome priest entered the room and shut the pocket doors behind him . " It 's raining , " Father Jorge announced superfluously . He was drenched . " Just the walk from the bus stop . " Without asking , he took a seat in the silver brocatelle wing-back chair opposite the desk . The Nuncio started to protest , but thought better of it . He knew he had a reputation for being finicky ; and besides , his affection for the young man inclined him to forgiveness . He thought Father Jorge one of the most interesting , attractive , and original young men he had ever met . Father Jorge had been orphaned in El Salvador during the cruelest civil war in Central America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing his extraordinary promise and his natural piety , had arranged to send him to Madrid for schooling , where he was Europeanized and fashioned into an intellectual . A mestizo with dark Indian skin and liquid black eyes , which he hid behind round tortoiseshell glasses , Father Jorge still bore a slight trace of Castilian accent , which somehow added to his charm without making him appear at all pretentious . " You 've heard the news , of course . " The Nuncio nodded . That very morning the city had been electrified by the report that Panama 's most famous revolutionary , Dr. Hugo Spadafora , had been murdered . " He was on his way to the capital to make charges against Noriega , " said Father Jorge . " Everybody knew that he had been promising to reveal the connections between the General and the narcotraffickers . " " Yes , I heard him on the radio last week . He said he had a briefcase full of evidence . What do you know about it ? " " These remarks come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Jorge said , betraying no emotion behind the shiny , round lenses . " Let us say they are observations of one who was intimate with a certain lieutenant . " The Nuncio had given his secretary permission to spend part of each week ministering to the poor in El Chorrillo , a vast slum in the center of town that surrounded the Panamanian military headquarters . He thought it might add to his protg 's portfolio when the Holy See began looking for prospects . Happily , there was an unexpected dividend in this part-time assignment : many soldiers came to the Chorrillo parish to pray , as did their women  --  the wives and girlfriends and mistresses who were such invaluable sources of intelligence , especially for Father Jorge , whose dark good looks and scrupulous chastity made him a sought-after curiosity in female society . " As we know , Hugo left Costa Rica on Friday , the thirteenth , " Father Jorge continued . " He took a taxi across the border and had a serving of rabbit stew in a small cantina . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got as far as Concepcin . He was taken off the bus by a PDF officer and escorted to military headquarters . That is the last sighting of the living Hugo Spadafora . Three days later his headless corpse was discovered in a U.S. mailbag on the Costa Rican border . " " Unburied ? " " Exactly , dumped on a riverbank , obviously meant to be found . By the way , I have secured the coroner 's report , " said Father Jorge , trying to suppress the note of triumph in his voice as he passed the photocopied document to the Nuncio , who eagerly snatched it up . " As you can see , he was quite extensively tortured . " " And raped , I see , " the Nuncio said as he examined the report , which was slightly damp from Father Jorge 's clothing . " Yes , apparently they severed his hamstrings so he could n't resist . And when they finished they drove a stake up his ass . " The Nuncio cast an uncritical but surprised look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had ventured anything like a vulgarity . The impassiveness of the young priest 's expression assured the Nuncio that he was merely speaking clinically , with his usual harrowing exactitude . " At the end , a PDF cook cut off his head , " Father Jorge added . " Are we to make anything of that ? " asked the Nuncio . " What do you mean ? " " The entire country is in love with witchcraft . No doubt they believe that there is some juju to be gotten from such practices . " " I think it 's just a show to terrify the masses . " " Perhaps , " said the Nuncio , " but before the drug money came to Panama , Noriega would never have stooped to this . This is not his style . " He reached for one of Sister Sarita 's sugar wafers and held it in front of him , as if it contained some vital mystery . " But as long as he is out of the country , he can maintain that he knew nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " The Nuncio placed the coroner 's report in a slender drawer in the center of his desk , which he locked with a key he kept in the pocket of his cassock . " The great Hugo Spadafora , " he said meditatively . " You know , this time I think the little general has gone too far . " Three frightened men entered the driveway of a handsome villa in Fort Amador , a former American military base that had been turned over to the Panama Defense Forces . A high stone wall topped with shards of colored glass surrounded the grounds . As the car approached , the iron gate opened to receive it , then abruptly shut behind it with a clang of doom . The door chime played " Lara 's Song " from Doctor Zhivago . Presently a shirtless butler in Bermuda shorts opened the door . " Mr. Escobar is expecting you , " he said with pity in his voice . The three men  --  Csar Rodrguez , Floyd Carlton , and Kiki Pretelt  --  exchanged desperate glances , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of Pablo Escobar , the chief of security for the Medelln cartel . The office was tasteful but surprisingly modest for a man of Escobar 's wealth and resources . House-decorating magazines covered the coffee table . The shelves were bookless , lined instead with eight-track tapes and exotic Oriental vases . The centerpiece of the room , Escobar 's desk , was an elegant sheet of black slate . A paused Pac-Man game blinked on the computer screen . Behind the desk was a picture window opening on a resplendent garden . Hummingbirds dodged frantically through the blossoms . Escobar was sitting on his Exercycle with a towel around his neck , watching CNN . He did not seem to notice the men when they came in . They stood nervously aside and listened to the reporter describing Panama as a drug haven and a sanctuary for internationally known mobsters , such as the Ochoa brothers and Pablo Escobar . " Unlike many people here , Dr. Spadafora had the courage to speak out against the criminal element of Panamanian society , " the reporter continued . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noriega regime , but judging from the reaction to his death , it is only the beginning . " Escobar stopped pedaling . " What do you want to drink ? " he asked . " Strychnine or cyanide ? " Kiki collapsed , banging his head on the slate desk as he fell . " Get him off my rug , " Escobar ordered . " He 's bleeding on my fucking Karistan . " Floyd and Csar pulled Kiki to his feet . His eyes rolled slowly back into focus . " It was a joke , " said Escobar . " Ha , you should see your faces . You must have a very bad conscience to react in this manner . " Kiki tried to speak , but his lips seemed to be glued together . " Low blood sugar , Mr. Escobar , " said Floyd . " I think he missed breakfast . " Escobar gave them all a look of such disdain that Kiki began to wobble again . Floyd and Csar held him up . " The Bible says a man can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work for me and you work for Noriega . The time has come to choose . " " Mr. Escobar , there is no choice . You know our first loyalty is to you , " said Csar as the others nodded . " ' Loyalty '  --  this is an interesting word , " Escobar said as he toweled off . He was a pudgy man with a frowning mustache . " Perhaps it means something different in Panama . In Colombia , when we pay a man for his cooperation , we get his cooperation . If he does n't wish to work with us  --  okay ! He does n't take our money . But this ! I give Noriega five million dollars . I entrust it to you . You tell me he appreciates it . " " He was very grateful . I am sure of this , " Csar said . " Yes , he even sends me this vase , " said Escobar , indicating a delicate blue ceramic , which resonated in a pleasing low hum as he traced his finger around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the finest pieces in my collection . Very rare , a genuine treasure . " " It 's exquisite , " Kiki said in a hoarse whisper . " This is true . He also rents me this villa , but he charges me so much I wonder if I can afford his generosity . Now I learn that he has closed down our new processing lab  --  a world-class facility , the finest I have ever seen , a work of great genius . Twenty-three of my workers captured  --  highly skilled men , men with families  --  taken off to jail . As if they had no protection . As if they had no assurance from me of their safety . " " This is wrong , " said Csar indignantly . " Most definitely a very wrong thing . " " Yes , it is . And now I want that you deliver a message to the General , " said Escobar , his face turning black with fury . " You tell that little wart he 's going to die ! Right here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his liver to the house cat ! Do you think he can understand that ? This is business ! " With that , Pablo Escobar hurled his prized Ming vase through the picture window , sending shards of glass into the hibiscus and scattering hummingbirds into the sky . Dr. Jrgen Spracht , the world-famous Swiss dermatologist , carefully unwrapped the gauze from the face of one of his most difficult cases  --  M.N. , as he was known in the medical literature , a middle-aged Latin man badly scarred by multiple lesions of acne vulgaris that continued to erupt long after adolescence . It was a challenging case , one that Spracht had been working on for nearly a dozen years with admittedly modest success . " Ja , " he said as the gauze lifted to reveal a raw red scab covering the patient 's entire face . " It 's clearing , it 's definitely clearing . " The patient started to smile , but the scab cracked like a boiled egg . M.N. 's eyes registered a bolt of pain . " Not moving ist best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking ist nicht so gut . " The patient grunted in response . " Now the nuss will apply special ointment , and we will bandage all over again . Agweed ? No movement . " As a blond nurse in a gratifyingly tight lab coat leaned over and began to swab a stinging green unguent on the throbbing wound , ignoring the muzzled cries of pain , the door opened , and a very alarmed receptionist stuck her head in . " There 's an emergency call for General Noriega ! " she announced . " I am busy , " the patient said through clenched teeth . " It 's the president of Panama , " the receptionist exclaimed in an awed voice . " Nicky , what the fuck do you want ? " the patient asked as Dr. Spracht held the phone to his ear . On the other end of the line there was a brief transatlantic pause , then President Nicols Ardito Barletta responded , " Tony , I have serious news . Something very important has come up . Incidentally , Roberto is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Roberto Daz Herrera , the colonel who was second in command of the Panama Defense Forces . " What is the problem ? " Tony demanded . " Hugo Spadafora has been murdered , " Barletta said in a strangely neutral tone of voice . " Good , " said Tony . " This is good . " " Uh , yes , of course we agree , but the people are not taking it so well , " Barletta continued . " I do n't know if you can hear the honking outside . I 'm holding the phone out the window for you . " Tony listened to the cacophonous traffic outside the presidential palace and the distant chanting of his name . " There is great agitation , " Roberto added unhelpfully . " The people hold you responsible . " " Listen , Nicky , I ca n't talk about this now , " said Tony . " You should call me in New York next week . " " Next week ! " said Barletta . " Tony , what we 're saying is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Roberto . " Maybe it is more important for you to be here than in Paris , or Switzerland , or New York , or whatever . " " We think either you should come home right away , or else ... " Barletta 's voice trailed away significantly . " Or else ? " The threat implicit in that phrase echoed in Tony 's mind as his limo crawled through the Geneva traffic . What did they think of him  --  that he would abdicate ? Live the rest of his life in Switzerland ? Who did they think they were dealing with ? Did Nicky and Roberto imagine that they could run Panama without him ? The thought would have made Tony laugh if the consequences were n't so painful . His thoughts flew about in confusion . Hugo dead . Tony 's nemesis gone . Out of his life . Out of life itself . It should be an occasion to rejoice . It was certainly an opportunity to reflect on the nature of divine justice . Hugo had been everything Tony was not : tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nothing , his fame turned to vaporous memory . Delicious victory , especially after the noise that Hugo had made about Tony and the narcos , the threats he had made on the radio , the " proof " he had boasted about having in that little book of his . But panic was banging on the door demanding to be admitted . Hugo  --  dead ! Everyone would blame Tony for it . They already were ! Something enormous had shifted in Tony 's universe , and only God knew how it would throw the planets out of alignment . A little change was containable . Too much change made everything crazy . But in any case , he had a more pressing concern impatiently awaiting for him at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International . Tony glanced at his watch and shuddered . Twenty minutes later , the limo came to a halt in front of BCCI 's imposing Geneva headquarters , and Tony darted out , carrying a weighty valise . " Four o'clock ! " Tony periscoped his head toward the sound of that stony-hearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surrounded by shopping bags and stroking the head of the dead fox attached to the fur around her shoulders : Felicidad , his formidable wife , staring at him with the eyes of an assassin . " You said to meet you here at four o'clock and you show up at ten to five ! " Her voice echoed in the oddly rapt lobby . " Sweetness , the traffic  --  " Felicidad made a clucking , dismissive sound that caused Tony 's knees to go weak . " But I have arranged a surprise for you , " he pleaded . " This is something I am sure you will appreciate . " " I 've got a massage at six . " " Please , dearest , this is most important to our future , I swear it . " " This had better be worth it . " A few minutes later Tony and Felicidad were seated in a small but luxurious conference room in the high-security subbasement , decorated with investment-quality folk art and hand-painted Haitian furniture . " Very tasteful , " Felicidad decreed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tony . We should do this in the den . " She seemed to be mollified by the prospect of extensive redecoration . Tony nodded agreeably , although the thought of turning his den into a replica of a Swiss bank office filled him with  --  well , mixed feelings . On the one hand , how pathetic , how derivative , how frankly weird to come upon Caribbean handicrafts in this chilled subterranean Swiss vault ; on the other hand , he had to admit , it looked better here , it looked like real art . A ghoulish frieze of skeletons tangoed on the painted tabletop . Life in death : it was so primitive , so unreconstructed , so strangely powerful now that Tony saw it out of context . Perhaps something in the cold Swiss soul longed for chaotic tropical vitality . Tony considered himself an expert on the Swiss , since he had been coming here annually for a decade now , both to do his banking and for the spa where Felicidad got massages and Tony received Dr. Spracht 's savage facial treatments  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less continual erection . Of course , the Swiss claim they do n't deal in voodoo , but Tony recognized magic when he saw it . He would have to get the recipe for those injections . It occurred to him that there was a correspondence between his own radical Latin soul and the mountain-bound conservatism of these magical , cheese-eating blonds . Perhaps he should stay here after all , he reflected ; life would not be so bad . Here , in frumpy Geneva , Tony could experience his own Swissness . He , too , had a longing for neutrality . He , too , yearned to step out of the arena of conflict , to achieve the spiritual contentment that seemed so native to the curtained horizons of Europe 's dairyland . He supposed it was mere cultural difference that allowed this bank , which had been established for the sole purpose of hiding drug profits from Colombia and stashing away large portions of the Third World GNP in numbered accounts , to appear so respectable , so within the bounds , so spiritually untroubled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : money does n't smell . Presently the door opened and a nervous young teller appeared . Behind her was a bulky man in shirtsleeves and an apron who was pushing a heavy metal cart . The man in the apron took a quick glance at the General , then cast his eyes into middle space as he pushed the cart into the conference room . Tony waited until the bankers were gone , then he opened the valise and dumped $13 million on the table . Felicidad looked at him with scorn . " Tony , did you think you could buy me off ? " That , of course , was exactly what he had thought . He took a key from his pocket and opened the vault on top of the cart . There were stacks of currency inside , mounds of it  --  dollars , francs , yen , marks  --  and a dozen shining gold ingots . Tony lifted one of the gold bars and pressed it over his head like a dumbbell . " Heavy , " he said , noticing that the underside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fox close around her shoulders despite the thin bead of perspiration that had formed on her upper lip . " Tony , what is this ? " " Money . Lots and lots of money . " Tony casually began to stack the new currency into the vault . " But where did it come from ? " Felicidad asked hesitantly . Her breath was shallow and faint . " Hard work . Investments . A few gifts . It 's retirement benefits , mainly . " " They could hang you for this . " " I did n't steal it ! People give me things  --  it 's part of my job to do favors , and in return , they give me little donations . " " Tony , this is a lot of favors . " " Many favors , many donations . " " I do n't want to know the details , " Felicidad said as she cautiously fanned through a bundle of thousand-yen notes . " And what do you expect from me , with all this ? " " Understanding . Patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am not so perfect , but you must admit there are compensations . Take that into account , that is what I am saying . " " Even so , Tony , the power , all this money  --  it 's not infinite , you know . " " Not infinite , but is n't it enough ? " " Tony , you ask for the forgiveness of a saint . I am not a saint . How many times you have wronged me ! Did you expect to buy me , like one of your whores ? " " Fela , I ask you please to respect the fact that I have made you one of the richest women in the world . It is not so small a thing . " Felicidad looked at Tony and then at the mountain of cash and bullion . " You have been a good provider , this I agree . So I can tell you this much : what 's in the past is past . " " That is all I ask , " Tony said gratefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin against me or your family ! " " No , of course ... " " You can ask this only once , Tony . The slate is clean . From now on , you must behave yourself . Do not try to find the end of my patience  --  it is very near ! " Tony put his hand over his heart . " Fela , I swear to you , from this day forward , I am a new man . "
