In " The Thief with Two Deaths " ( June 2000 ) , Chris Willrich introduced us to the poet Persimmon Gaunt and the eponymous Imago Bone , as unlikely a duo as we 've seen since Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser . Their latest adventure is a dense and richly rewarding tale . Mr. Willrich says he grew up in the Puget Sound area and is fond of the rain there , which might explain some of the imagery in this tale . These days he lives in California and works in the Stanford University library . <p> A king of Swanisle delights in rue And his name 's a smirking groan . Laughgloom , Bloodgrin , Stormproud we knew Before Rain joy took the throne . - Rainjoy 's Curse IT WAS SUNSET IN Serpenttooth when Persimmon Gaunt hunted the man who put oceans in bottles . The town crouched upon an islet off Swanisle 's west coast , and scarlet light lashed it from that distant ( but not unreachable ) place where the sunset boiled the sea . The light produced a striking effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they built with what they found , and what they found were the bones of sea serpents . And at day 's end it seemed the gigantic , disassembled beasts struggled again toward life , for a pale , bloody sheen coated the town 's archways , balustrades , and rooftops . Come evening the illusion ceased , and the bones gave stark reflection to the moon . But the abductor meant to be gone before moonrise . From the main town she ascended a cliffside pathway of teeth sharp as arrowheads , large as stepping-stones . The teeth ended at a vast , collapsed skull , reinforced with earth , wood , and thatch , bedecked with potted plants . There was a door , a squarish fragment of cranium on hinges , with a jagged eyeslit testifying to some ancient trauma . Shivering in the briny sea-wind , Gaunt looked over her shoulder at the ruddy sunset rooftops . She did not see the hoped-for figure of a friend , leaping among the gables . " Your last chance to help , Imago , " she murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , dimly glowing , peered through the eyeslit . " Eh ? " wheezed a harsh voice . Gaunt imagined in it the complaints of seagulls , the slap of breakers . " Persimmon Gaunt , " she answered . " A poet . " " A bard ? " The voice snorted . " The king exiled those witch-women , ten years gone . " " I am not a bard ! My tools are stylus and wax , paper and quill , not voice and memory . I have the distinction of being banished by the bards , before the king banished them . " Gaunt could be charming , particularly in such a setting : her specialty in verse was morbidity , the frail railing of life against merciless time . Serpenttooth suited her . More , she suited Serpenttooth , her fluttering auburn hair a wild contrast to . her pale , angular face , the right cheek tattooed with a rose ensnared by a spiderweb . But these charms failed . " What do you want , poet ? " " I am looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of this . " She lifted a small , corked bottle . Within nestled an intricate , miniature sailing ship fashioned of bone . Its white sails curved in an imaginary wind ; its banners were frozen in the midst of rippling . Yet the ship was not the extraordinary thing . There was water below it , not bone or glass , and the water moved : not the twitching of droplets but the roiling of a shrunken corner of the sea . It danced and flickered , and the ship heaved to and fro , riding the tiny surge . Gaunt waved the bottle in various directions , but the ship cared nothing for gravity , forever hugging its tiny sea . " Exquisite , " Gaunt murmured , and not for the first time . " A trinket , " sniffed the other . " Trinket ? For four years these " trinkets " have been the stuff of legend along the coast ! And yet their fame does not travel further . Most who own such bottles - sailors , fishermen , pirates , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell at any price . It 's said these folk have all lost something dear to the sea . " " Nothing to do with me . " " There is more . " Gaunt unstoppered the bottle . " Listen . Hear the sound of the sea . Hear the deep loneliness , and the deep romance . To know it is to know mischievous waves , and alluring shores . To brush raw fingertips against riches and fame . To wrap scarred arms around hunger and harm . To know the warm fantasy of a home long abandoned , and the cold acceptance of a five fathom grave . " And there was a susurrant murmur from the bottle which held all these things , and more which Gaunt , too chill already , would not say . There came a long answering sigh from behind the door . It blended with the murmur , and Gaunt could not distinguish them . Weakly , the voice said , " Nothing to do with me . Go . " " I can not . When an .. associate of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner . We know who you are , Master Salt . " A pause . " You are base thieves . " Gaunt smiled . " Imago would insist he is a refined thief , I 'm sure . And our victim was a dying lord who had no further use for the bottle . " " What do you want ? " " I bring you greetings , " Gaunt said , " from your own maker . " There was silence . The door opened on creaking hinges . A figure stepped aside , and Gaunt entered . The room resembled a captain 's cabin , though it filled a sea serpent 's skull , not a vessel 's stem . Two oval , bone-framed windows overlooked the ruddy sunset sea . Underneath , shutters covered twin ventilation passages to the skull 's nostrils . Nearby , a spyglass rested atop a bookcase of nautical texts . But the other dozen bookcases cradled dozens of ships  --  in-bottles , each bearing its own churning , miniature sea . Half-constructed vessels listed upon a vast table , pieces scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ship sailing forever ceilingward . Master Salt bent over it . " The Darkfast Dreamweaver . Fitting . Named for a great philosopher-thief of Ebontide . " A smile sliced his face . He was built like a sea barrel , yet possessed delicately shimmering blue skin . His bald head resembled a robin 's egg gleaming with dew . " Her crew captured the hatchling of a Serpent of the Sunset . Quite a story . But they overfed the child , to keep it from thrashing . It outgrew its bonds , fed well indeed . " He nodded at the shelves . " Lost ships , all of them . I see their profiles in my dreams . Hear their names on the morning wind . " " They are astonishing . The king will be enthralled . " " Him , " muttered Salt . " He neglected me , my sisters . Left us eight years in our tower , because we dared remind him he had a soul . We resolved to seek our own lives . " Gaunt said , " Now your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Surely you can not abandon him , " Gaunt persisted , " being what you are . " " If you know what I am , poet , you should fear me . Inhuman myself , I read the sorrow behind human eyes . " His gaze locked hers . Gaunt shivered as though a westerly wind scoured her face , but could not look away . Salt squinted , then smirked . " You say I abandon ? I see what you 've left behind . You forsook the bards for the written word . And now you even neglect your art .. for the love of a thief . " Master Salt 's eyes changed . One moment they glowed a pale blue ; then they resembled blue-sheened , mirrored glass . Yet the person reflected in them was not Gaunt , nor was the moment this one . Instead she beheld a scene from an hour ago . A man leapt to and fro upon buildings of bone . There was a strange style to his movements . Though he chose his destinations in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though an old man carefully doled out a youth 's energy . When he paused , Gaunt could see the two scars of his lean , ferretlike face , one made by steel , one by fire . He gazed out from Master Salt 's eyes as if searching for her . Then he leapt to a new height . " The thief Imago Bone , your lover and sometimes your mentor , prancing about on bone rooftops . Suppose he could n't resist . " Salt blinked his eyes back to their former , glowing state . " But you knew he might be gone for hours . Impatient , you continued alone . " Gaunt 's breathing quickened . She found she could not evade Master Salt , nor lie . " Yes . For all Bone 's skill ... " " ... he is a boy , " Master Salt said . " Yes , I see . I can taste sorrows , poet . Imago Bone 's life is an accident , is it not ? Bizarre magics stretched his adolescence nearly a century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thief ; but he is a child in many ways . You fear for him . You are as often his guardian as his student . An unlikely pair , following foolish quests . " " They are not foolish . " Gaunt shivered , staring into the shimmering blue eyes . " Not all ..... " " Quests are excuses , poet . You must live as you wish . As I have done . You do not need bards , or Imago Bone , or King Rainjoy to justify your wanderlust . " Gaunt imagined she felt the tug of the trade winds . Or perhaps it was the clatter of a horse beneath her , the taste of bow-spray from a river canoe , the scent of a thousand fragile mountain wildflowers . " A true wanderer , " Salt said , " needs no nation , no captain , no hope of gold to answer the siren lure . " And Gaunt wondered , why had she tried to refashion Bone and herself as heroes , when they could simply travel , drink in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must resist Salt 's words . " There - will be war , " she stammered , " unless Rainjoy can learn compassion .... And he never can , without you . " " I see also , " Salt said unmoved , " why you help him . " Gaunt lowered her eyes . " Abandon that guilt , poet . Abandon all that imprisons you ! Leave this quest ; join Bone as a thief if it suits you , or shirk him as well - either way , seize your freedom , and do not abuse mine . " Salt lifted his hand to Gaunt 's mouth . " I did not ask to become a someone , any more than humans do . Yet here I am , and I will set my own course . I will hear the sea , and trap its cries . " Now Master Salt scraped a thumbnail against the tip of an index finger , and a blue droplet fell against Gaunt 's lips . As the salty tang kissed her , she imagined the rocking of a deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled the stinging brine upon the lines . Her heart skipped once and her eyelids drooped , as she slipped toward a dream of adventure in distant waters , not merely losing her existence , but casting it aside like soiled clothes . But then from somewhere came Imago Bone 's easy voice . " You should listen to him , Gaunt , " Bone said . " He makes perfect sense . " With a start , Gaunt opened her eyes . Bone crawled through the passage leading to the dragon-skull 's nostrils , face blue from the cliffside winds and sweaty from carrying his many pouches of esoteric tools : ironsilk lines , quicksap adhesive , a spectrum of camouflaging dyes . As Master Salt turned , Bone sprang to the bottle sheltering the miniature Darkfast Dreamweaver . The thief shattered it against the table 's edge . Salt cried out . So did the broken bottle . The miniature ocean within the glass spilled onto the dirt floor , foaming and dwindling like a tendril of surf dying upon shore . A chorus of drowning sailors arose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices were gone . " Curse you , " spat Master Salt , and the spittle boiled upon the table , and gave a sound like maddened seagulls as it vanished . He seized the thief , pressing pale blue thumbs against Bone 's throat , thumbs that grew foam-white even as Bone went purple . " Allow ... " the thief gurgled , " allow me to introduce .... " " No , " said Master Salt . " Rude .... " Bone 's voice trailed off , and he flailed uselessly in Salt 's grip . Bone had saved her . Bone was friend , lover , companion on the road . Nevertheless Gaunt hesitated one moment as he suffocated ; so much poetry did the the shelves of bottles hold , they might have cradled densely inked scrolls from ancient libraries . But she knew what she must do . She shut her eyes and yanked . The shelves toppled , shattering glass , breaking small ships , spilling the trapped substance of Master Salt . The room filled with the despairing cries of lost sailors . Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saltwater . Salt knelt as well , trying to clutch the tiny oceans as they misted into nothingness . His knees crunched glass and crushed ships . Gaunt trembled with the destruction she 'd caused . But soon the sailors " voices faded to dim wailing , and she regained her voice . " Dead sailors move you ? " she asked . " Expect more . War is brewing . To prevent it , King Rainjoy will need the compassion he lost . The compassion you bear . " " You speak of compassion ? You , who can do this ? " " These voices are of men already lost . But if war comes , they will seem just a drop in a surgeon 's pail . " Salt lowered his head . " I will go , " he said at last . " If only to prevent your crushing more dreams . " Imago Bone rose with a look of gratitude , put his hand upon Gaunt 's shoulder . " I regret I did not arrive sooner , " he whispered , then smiled ruefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll talk of it later , " Gaunt said . " No one can help being who they are . " She leaned against him , but could not bear to look at him , nor at Master Salt , who gathered broken ships , tenderly , bone by scattered bone . " The first is found , " sighed the man upon the ivory chair . An older man , shuffling through the chamber of mists , stopped and coughed . " Majesty ? " " Persimmon Gaunt . And her companion thief . " The voice was dim , and flat . " They have found the first . Soon , all will be well . " " The reports I bring , ah , belie such optimism . " The older man scuttled closer . His robes fluttered with no regard to the drafts . " The nobles , hm , demand war with the Eldshore , if you can not secure an alliance by marriage . I suggest you build ships , raise troops . " He raised a wrinkled hand before the king 's nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He inverted the hand , revealing an enfleshment from the king 's memory , the tiny image of a red-haired woman , proud and bejeweled . She spat in the king 's direction . Her voice rose dimly : You are cold , with no soul within you . You shall never have me . Turning on her heel , she stalked off the palm and into nonexistence . " Eldshore 's princess will marry me , " said the king , " once lam a better man . Once they make me a better man . " " Strange , mm ? - that you can sense their doings while I can not . " Mirthlessly , the king smiled . " You may have made them , sorcerer , but they belong to me . " " Do not hope for too much , my king . War is in the air . " " When you are here , Spawnsworth , the air smells of worse . Leave your reports and go . " When the older man had retreated up a staircase , the king said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " From the staircase descended the sounds of tortured things . THE JOURNEY to Lombridge took two weeks , but they felt like two years to the thief Imago Bone . Master Salt spoke only in grunts . Surely thousands of subjects were capable of grunting for their king ; why should Rainjoy need this entity in particular ? Gaunt walked as though shouldering a treasure chest of guilt ( Bone often pictured metaphorical treasure chests , feeling deprived of real ones ) and there was a distance in her eyes even as she lay nights upon his shoulder . So it was a relief , finally , to risk his neck reaching a well-guarded noblewoman noted for feathering suitors with arrows . Seen through tall grass , the battlement looked sickly and moist in the moonlight . ( Bone 's cloak , after a treatment of saps and powders , matched it . ) He slithered beside it , scrambled halfway up , paused for heavy bootfalls to pass , then scurried atop . Time for one gulp of manure-scented air , then he was over the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove . He thudded onto a haycart exactly as the pigpen filled with squealing . By the time the guards investigated , the animals would have devoured the evidence . He slipped into courtyard shadows . This was more like it : sparks of danger against the steel of brilliant planning . A shame he was n't stealing anything . My beloved 's doing , Bone thought as he climbed atop a stable . When they met he was a legend , perhaps the greatest second-story man of the Spiral Sea . ( The higher stories went of course without question . ) Though she could pay little , he 'd accepted enormous risk recovering a manuscript of hers from a pair of sorcerous bibliophiles , a task that had required another book , a tome of the coldest kind of magic . That matter concluded , he 'd undertaken an absurdly noble quest , the accursed tome 's destruction . Absurd nobility impressed Persimmon Gaunt . Bone smirked , reversed his cloak to the side stained with berry juice , then leapt from the stable roof onto Duskvale Keep itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow corkscrew toward the highest window allowed him time to review six months of inquiries along the Spiral Sea , a process garnering nothing but scars , empty pockets , and a list of enemies who would n't at all mind the damnable book for themselves . Half jesting , half desperate , Bone had proposed consulting the court wizard of Swanisle . He 'd expected scowls . Swanisle was notorious for persecuting the bards of its county Gaunt ( a society of women compared to witches , and similarly treated ) formerly by burning , today by exile . He 'd assumed Persimmon left with her teachers , would seethe at the thought of returning . But she had assented with a strange look . Bone should have worried more at that look . Distracted by such thoughts , Bone froze upon hearing a bright swish . Presently , from afar , came a dim thunk . Lady Duskvale was firing off correspondence . There was not one keep at Lornbridge but two , separated by the narrow , abysmal Groangorge . Westward stood Duskvale Keep and eastward rose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to Bone , the youth of Duskvale and Mountdawn had swooned for each other , sighing and pining across the impassable deep . Then , four years ago , the keeps " masters paupered themselves constructing a bridge . The fortresses became one small town . Not merely did a stone span connect the castle ; dozens of hundred-foot ropes , cables , and pulleys twisted overhead with messages , squirrels , nobles " drying underwear . Yet today the bridge was guarded , the ropes cut , the youth forbidden to mix Swish . Thunk . Bone smirked and climbed beside the topmost window . " Oh , why does he not write me ? " he heard a voice exclaim . Bone craned his head . " Perhaps because - " " Ay ! " An arrow shot past , a roll of paper wound upon the shaft . This time there followed no thank but a dim clatter upon the stone bridge , " Perhaps , " Bone said , heart pounding , " because he is not as good a shot as yourself . Though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? ! the voice demanded . Bone crouched upon the sill , and bowed . " Bone : acquirer of oddities . " Lady Duskvale regarded him with hawk-dark eyes framed by stern cheekbones and black rivulets of hair . " Do you plan mischief ? I warn you , I will tolerate mischief with but one man , and he I fire arrows at . For you I have a knife for stabbing , and lungs for screaming . " " I have no wish for mischief , stabs , or screams . " " Are you .. are you a messenger from Lord Mountdawn ? " " Better than that , my lady . I am Bone . I and the poet Gaunt have come to comfort Lombridge . May I enter ? " " I would be more comforted with you outside . " " Even a footpad 's foot may fall asleep . " " One moment . " She nocked an arrow , drew , and aimed . Then she backed into the room . " All right . " Bone leapt inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of your arm - but it is not thieves at your window you must fear . It is the embodiment of sorrow . " She raised her eyebrows , and Bone helped himself to a chair beside a small table serviceable as a shield . He drummed his fingers upon it . " Consider , my lady . In your father 's day , these keeps were famous for romance . Men and women pined hopelessly from across the gulf . But that has changed . " " You mock me , thief ? " Duskvale 's fingers quivered upon the bowstring , as did Bone 's upon the table . " Of course it has changed . " " Explain . " " Very well , though my arm grows weaker . Four years ago my father and old Lord Mountdawn , rest their souls , heard identical whispers in their sleep , imploring them to build the bridge . For a time all was glorious . Yet if there are whispers now , they implore weeping . Bravos duel for damsels , spurned paramours hurl themselves into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountdawn , are spared these frenzies , for we are calculating and circumspect . " A carrier pigeon fluttered through the window , alighting upon a perch near Duskvale . She regarded it and Bone , then sighed and set down her bow . ( Bone released a long breath . ) Removing a note from the pigeon 's foot , Duskvale read , " ' Soon I must fight my way across the bridge to your side . Each arrow is a caress , but I would kiss the callouses of the hand that fired it . Dear one ! Alive or dead , my bloody hide arrives in the morning ! " " She looked up in vexation . " You are interrupting a private conversation , you know . Explain your purpose . " " Are you aware , " Bone asked , " that your monarch was once called the Weeping King ? " " Rainjoy ? " she mused . " I heard Father say as much . A sensitive boy crushed by the crown 's weight , weeping at the consequences of all commands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overwrought at times . But the king has changed . Now they call him Rainjoy the Stonefaced . What does it matter ? " " Did your father speak of the Pale Council ? " " Everyone knows of them , " Duskvale said impatiently . " Rainjoy 's wise advisors . They came from far away and never went among the people . But the people loved them , for they counseled compassion , and kept the king 's cruel wizard at bay . But they departed four years ago and this is of no consequence and my beloved is about to die for me . " " Hear this : the Council did not come from a far land , nor did they return there . One member dwells nearby . " " What ? " " They are creatures of magic , my dear , born of a bargain between Rainjoy and his wizard . " " What bargain ? " " That Rainjoy , so wracked by conscience he could not function as king , should weep but three more tears in his life . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rainjoy wished he could safely seek the insights of sorrow . " Duskvale fingered her bow . " Impossible . " " No , merely quite ill-advised . I 've met one such tear . Another dwells here . We will need your help , and your paramour 's , to snare it . Tell me , do you retain builders " plans for the bridge ? " In the end it was the sincerity in Bone 's eyes , or ( more likely ) the desperation in Duskvale 's heart , that bade her send a pointed message to Mountdawn and then summon servants to make certain preparations . Bone was relieved not to relate stealing her father 's ship-in-a-bottle and rifling his memoirs . For it was Lord Duskvale who had owned the faux Darkfast Dreamweaver , its surging in harmony with the whispers of Lornbridge . Soon the moonlight found the thief whistling , strolling across that great stone arch . At midpoint he squeezed a tiny sack of quicksap , which he smeared full across his gloves , then applied to his shoes . He descended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churning murmur of the river far below , the tickle of vertigo . Presently there came a swish from the west and a thunk to the east . At this signal Bone crawled underneath the span , hairs pointing toward watery , rocky doom . Where the plans indicated it would be , he discovered a square opening . He crawled inside . Blue light surrounded him . " Who ? " called a bleak voice , like a hollow wind through a shattered house . The chamber was like a monk 's cell , a cold stone sitting room with a few books ( with such titles as Ballad of the Poisoned Paramour and The Tragickal History of Violet Swoon ) , some decoration ( withered roses ) , odd mementos ( lockets with strands of hair inside ) , and a lamp ( bearing not oil but a pale blue liquid glimmering like glacial moonlight ) . " I had gambled , " Bone said , shedding his gloves , " you would not wish to miss the romantic play of light upon the river . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and I bring greetings from the king . " The quicksap discarded , Bone gazed upon Rainjoy 's tear . She resembled a spindly , large-eyed maiden in a white shift . She shimmered gently in the blue light , reflecting and echoing it . Her long white hair fluttered and frayed , blending into the chamber 's dim mists . She regarded Bone with incomprehension . " Rainjoy abandoned us . " " He would enjoy your counsel again . " " I can not give it . I am not his anymore , a slave , nameless .. now I am Mistress Mist . This is my home . There must be love in the world , you see . Lonely were these keeps , but I whispered of this bridge , and they are lonely no longer . Still do I whisper of love . " " You whisper of more than that . Men and women have perished . " " I do not slay them , " Mist answered sadly . " In my presence they sense what purest love could be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bone . " But you - why are you here ? When your true love is elsewhere , waiting and worrying . Why while your precious moments with me ? Do you abandon her for me ? Do you betray ? " A chill enveloped him ; he could not evade those eyes . He thought of Persimmon Gaunt . Of course he would not betray her for this apparition . And yet - was he not flippant , unheedful of her ? His dallying upon the rooftops of Serpenttooth nearly caused her death . Did he not repay devotion with childish disregard ? Was he not cruel ? He did not deserve her , he realized , nor life . Better to end his existence now , than risk wounding her further . Bone yearned for the abyss at his back . But even as the impulse for annihilation took over , his old lust for living cried out . He could not prevent his leap , but he modified the angle and , falling , grasped the ironsilk strand fired by Lady Duskvale . The thread bent , rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he trembled with the urge to release it , dash himself to bits far below . Fortunately the impulse weakened away from Mist . He saw Gaunt leaning over the bridge 's side . " I am sorry .... " " What ? " she shouted . He shook his head , cried instead : " Pigeon ! " Gaunt raised her arm . From the Mountdawn side of the chasm a pigeon fluttered to alight upon Bone 's shoulder , a poem of Gaunt 's affixed to its leg . Bone shrugged the bird upward and it fluttered into the hidden chamber . Presently Bone heard a sad voice , reading . " Love floating skyward is earthly no longer Braced with selfishness , ardor is stronger On solid ground let rest love 's wonder And so your bridge we break asunder . " " Picks ! " Bone shouted , and at once there sang a chorus of metal biting stone . " No ! " A large silvery blob , like a pool of mercury ignorant of gravity , flowed from beneath the bridge and oozed upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and although Bone could not see her , he heard Mist shout , " I concede ! The bridge will be mute without me . Please do not break it . Keep it , and find love if you can . I will go . " A voice like lonely seabirds answered , " They snared me likewise , sister . For we can not destroy as they do . " " Yes , brother . They ruin themselves , and each other . We only awaken their sorrow . " " But the last tear will defeat them , sister . The last is the strongest of all . " " The second is found , " said the king in the room of mists . Framing the ivory throne , twin pillars of rainwater poured from funnels and spilled into a pool with a swan 's outline , wingtips catching the water , nose aimed at the throne 's foot , a drain where the heart should be . Just as they believed distress strengthened the spirit , the royal house of Swanisle believed chill weather quickened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waded in , his pensive expression unchanged . From beside the throne his companion said carefully , " This poet is , ah , resourceful . " " Of course . She is a bard of Gaunt . " " Mm . Never forget , majesty , her ilk caused you great pain . " The king shivered in his pool . It gave him a look that resembled passion . " Great pain . And great wonder . I remember how every spider in its shimmering , dew-splattered web was an architect of genius to be cherished , not squashed . I remember a defiant spark in the eyes , a stony strength in the limbs of every maiden men declared ugly . I remember the disbelieving child in the faces of condemned men , a child whose mind might yet encompass creation , were that infinite head still upon that foreshortened neck . I remember knowing these things , Spawnsworth , but I can no longer feel them . But they will help . Soon . " " Soon , " the wizard murmured , scratching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pained by needlepricks . NIGHTSWAN ABBEY formed the outline of a soaring bird , and although its crumbling bulk no longer suggested flight of any kind , the music pouring from its high windows did much to compensate . A crowd of the young and elderly gathered beneath the sanctuary windows every evening to hear the sweet polyphony , as the purple sunset kissed the first of the night 's stars . The sisterhood could sing only within these walls ; all else would be vanity . Even so , during the last four years their music had rekindled some of Nightswan 's fame , long dimmed in this age of grim , conquering kings . It was as if those hundred mortal throats conjured the spirit of the Swan Goddess of the Night and the Stars , she who plunged into the sun , seawater glistening upon her wings , to cool its fire and make the Earth temperate and fit for life , she whose charred body fell back into the sea , to become Swanisle . The music ceased and the listeners drifted away , murmuring to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes . Soon , two reemerged , one casting a line to a window , the second glancing backward . " They will not flee , " Gaunt whispered . " They are contemptuous , certain their sister will humble us . I am uneasy . " Bone shrugged . " We will handle her . We 've seen worse , we two . " Gaunt did not reply . They ascended to the vast sanctuary , slipping behind the winged marble altar of the Swan . In the pews a lone nun prayed . Her white cap , cut in the outline of a swan , enhanced the rich darkness of a robe embroidered with tiny stars . The intruders made hand signals : they would pause until she departed . Then the nun looked up , her face still shadowed by her hood , and sang in a voice sweet as any of the abbey 's chorus , yet with an unexpected pain , as though a delicate aperitif were served too hot . The first stanza was muted , but her voice rose with the second : King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy , Who had not learned to love distress : Soft-hearted was Rainjoy . Gaunt gave Bone a sharp look , listening . His shivering toes just touched the floor When he claimed his father 's chair . When the sad queen 's heart would beat no more He tore his silky hair . The nun rose . The intruders hid themselves behind the onyx , speckled pulpit as she approached the altar , still singing . Yet when a wizard of county Gaunt ( Spawnsworth was his name ) Tried his wicked strength to flaunt The boy king 's heart took flame . For all Gaunt 's fear , and all its horror Marched as Rainioy 's foe . Enfleshment was the wizard 's lore To fashion warriors from woe . The sister knelt where the wine was kept , the wine that symbolized the goddess 's blood , shed to make all life possible . She cast a surreptitious glance over her shoulder . Her face was a pale , dimly glowing blue , growing brighter as she sang . Rainjoy led his armies north , Felled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ride forth Till they conquered all his lands . Now the bards of Gaunt were rightly known To clasp old secrets to the breast . So the army overturned every stone Till the king beheld the best . The nun passed her hand over the wine vessel , and shining droplets fell into the dark liquid . They quickly dimmed , and the wine appeared as before . " Gaunt 's ancient thanes , " King Rainjoy spoke , " The very land would quick obey . " To free it from the wizard 's yoke " I must know Gaunt as did they . " The woman said , " What you seek takes years , " A lifetime spent in Gaunt , " A knowledge born of woe and tears , " Not a young man 's morning jaunt . " " My father died on Eldshore 's strand . " My mother died of loss . " A wizard makes to seize my land " This die I 'll gladly toss . " At last Gaunt could stand waiting no more , and stepped forward . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile Bone leapt forward , tumbled , rolled , and stood where he blocked the nun 's best retreat . He bowed low , eyes upon her . In a hot , dusky voice more evocative of tavern than tabernacle , the nun said , " You are agents of the king , I take it ? " She raised her head , showing a weary blue face and sapphire smile like a dagger-cut . " I 've sensed my siblings being gathered . " " You are correct . I am Persimmon .. of Gaunt . A poet . This is my companion , Bone . We bear Rainjoy 's plea for your help . He must marry Eldshore 's princess to stop a war , but she refuses . She senses Rainjoy feels no sorrow , knows no compassion . " " A wise woman . " The tear laughed , one sharp , jarring note . " I am Sister Scald . You are a poet of Gaunt ? Did Gaunt 's bards train you , before Rainjoy exiled them ? " " They did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes widened . " Did you learn " Rainjoy 's Curse ? " " " Yes , " Gaunt said . And she did not sing , but continued Scalds song in speech . She led him then , where doomed ships had lunged At cliffs where white foam churned ; To chasms where young suitors plunged , To pyres where bards had burned . She wooed him with rhymes of sailors drowned , And songs of lovers dead , And poems of bards long in the ground , Until she wooed him to her bed . Into a fevered dream he fell Of the web that snares all lives One soul 's joy breeds another 's hell . One suffers , and one thrives . He woke to slaps : For bedding her so , She offered jibe and taunt . He trembled chill as she did go ; For now he knew the soul of Gaunt . And when the nightmare horde returned , Raised from Gaunt 's old pain , He told it , " Sleep , for I have learned : " Let the land swallow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wizard quick was seized . Spawnsworth said , " O king of worth , " How might you be appeased ? " Rainjoy trembled . " I feel each death . " All paths shine slick with blood . " I can not bear to end your breath . " The mage swore fealty where he stood . A king of Swanisle delights in rue And his name 's a smirking groan . But in Rainjoy endless tears did brew And he longed for eyes of stone . Scalds voice bit the silence . " He has those eyes now . The bards gave him knowledge of all life 's woe , but Spawnsworth tricked him out of his tears . For a time he still consulted us , but who willingly seeks out sorrow ? At last he consulted us no more . He became the sort of king Spawnsworth could control . " " He senses what he 's lost . Serve him again . " " I serve others now . " Bone broke in . " Indeed ? Your brother served others with bottled grief , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these contrivances ; the tears surrendered . I say good riddance . " " You mock their work , thief ? " Scald seized Bone 's chin , locked eyes with his . " I see into your soul , decrepit boy . You 've begun aging at last , yet you fritter away your moments impressing this foolish girl . And you - " She released Bone , snatched Gaunt 's ear - " you forsook the glory of voice and memory for clumsy meanderings of ink . Now you neglect even that dubious craft following this great mistake of a man . " Scald stepped back , dismissing poet and thief with a wave . " What a pair you are , what a waste of wind your love ! Who are you , to lecture me ? " Shivering , Gaunt looked away , toward the tall windows and bright stars . But she replied . " I will tell you , tear of Rainjoy . I was a girl who saw the boy king rescue county Gaunt from the creatures who tore her family to bits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afar . And when my teacher boasted of how she granted his request by breaking his spirit , I knew I 'd follow her no more . " She looked at Bone , who regarded her wonderingly . " I 'd not guard secret lore in my skull , but offer my words in ink , telling of grief such that anyone could understand . I would tarry in graveyards and let tombs inspire my verse . For if the bards hoarded living song , I would peddle the dead , written word . " Gaunt returned her gaze to Scald . " When Spawnsworth made an end to Rainjoy 's weeping , the king 's first act was to exile the bards . And how I laughed that day . Come , tear . You can not shame me . I will repay my teachers " debt . " " You surprise me , " Scald said , " but I think you will not take me . I have no bottles , no bridge to harm . My substance passes into the sacramental wine , inspiring the sisters " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do not need to . " Gaunt gestured toward the door . Scald turned , saw a cluster of black , star-speckled habits underneath white swan hats . A nun with a silver swan necklace stepped forward , old hands trembling . " We have listened , Sister Scald . Gaunt and Bone sent warning by carrier pigeon that they would seek a king 's tear this night , unaware we 'd knowingly given you sanctuary . I have been tom , until this moment . I might defy even Rainjoy to honor our pledge , Scald .... But you have meddled with our sacraments . You must go . " " Oathbreaker , " Scald snarled . She looked right and left . " All of you - all humans are traitors , to yourselves , to others . Listen then , and understand . " And Scald sang . This song was wordless . It was as though the earlier music was simply the white breakers of this , the churning ocean , or the moonlit fog-wisps crossing the lip of this , the crevasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of human treachery , of weakness , of pain . Before that song the humans crumpled . " No ..... Gaunt whimpered , covering her face . " Nothing ..... whispered Bone . " I am nothing ... not man , not boy . A waste .... " Somehow , Bone 's anguish bestirred Gaunt to defy her own . " You are something . " She wrenched each word from her throat like splinters torn from her own flesh . " You are not a waste . " The sisters knelt , some mouthing broken regretful words , some clawing for something sharp , something hard , to make an end . But Gaunt raised her head to the singer . " Scald .... It should have been a defiant cry , but it emerged like a child 's plea . " Look what you do , to those who sheltered you ...... Scalds eyes were hard , lifted ceilingward in a kind of bitter ecstasy . Yet she looked , and for a time watched the nuns cringing upon the stone floor . She went silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am no better than you , " she murmured . " I sense my siblings , like me born of regret . It seems we can not escape it . " Scald removed her swan cap and lowered her head . " We will go . Gaunt helped Bone to his feet . He clutched her shoulders as though grasping some idea rare and strange . " Why did you not tell me , " he said , " of your family ? " She lowered her gaze . " When you suggested Spawnsworth might deal with that accursed tome we 've locked away , Bone , I believed his skills were not appropriate and his character untrustworthy . But I realized we two might somehow repay the debt I felt to Rainjoy . It was a deception , Bone , one that deepened with time . I feared you would be angry . " He nodded . " Perhaps later . Now I am merely glad there is still a Gaunt to perhaps be angry with . It is done . For better or worse , we 've recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are they , Bone ? Are they Rainjoy 's ? Or are they more like grown children ? I think whatever their faults , they have seized control of their existence . I think they are people . " She scowled in frustration . " I fear Scald is right ; I am never consistent . " " You can not deliver them up , now , can you ? " She shook her head . " Forgive me , Bone . We 've gained nothing . " " I disagree . " He leaned forward , kissed her . Startled , she kissed him back , then pulled away . " You are changing the subject ! You can never focus on one thing ; you are forever a boy . " " Fair enough , but I say you are the subject , and you are what I 've gained . I know you better , now . And I would rather know you better , Persimmon Gaunt , than plunder all the treasure-vaults of Brightcairn . Though I 'd cheerfully do both . " She gaped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever Scald may think of us . " She gazed at the bent figure beside the window . " To risk losing you three times this journey - it makes me care nothing for how odd is our love , our life . It is ours , and precious . " " Then my dear , " Bone said , " let 's discuss how we 'll evade the king 's assassins , when we break our pledge . " " How precious ..... Gaunt murmured , still watching Scald , and her eyebrows rose . " No , we will not break it , Bone ! We will fulfill it too well . " A STORM FROTHED against King Rainjoy 's palace , and the hall of mists felt like a ship deck at foggy dawn . Salt , Mist , and Scald stepped toward the ivory throne , knelt beside the swan pool . Behind the Pale Council stood Persimmon Gaunt and Imago Bone . Upon the throne , the king studied his prodigal tears . " So , " he said . The tears blinked back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the throne , his cloak twisting as though with suppressed annoyance . " I , ah , congratulate you . You have accomplished a great deed . " " Not so difficult , " Bone said easily . " Send us to fetch the morning star 's shyer cousin , or the last honest man 's business partner , and we might have surrendered . These three were not so well hidden . " He smiled . " Anyone might have found them . " " Whatever , " Spawnsworth said with a dismissive wave . " Your , um , modesty covers mighty deeds . Now , Majesty , I would examine these three in private . They have dwelled apart too long , and I fear they might be , ah , unbalanced . It might be years before I dare release them . " The tears said nothing , watching only Rainjoy . " Yes , " Rainjoy murmured , staring back , agreeing to something Spawnsworth had not said . " Yes , I would .. speak with them . " Before the sorcerer could object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spawnsworth 's fears are quite justified . I regret where duty leads . " With that , she drew a dagger and stabbed Sister Scald where her heart ought to have been . By then Bone had sliced the glistening throats of Master Salt and Mistress Mist . The king 's tears lost their forms , spilling at once from their robes , flowing like pale blue quicksilver into the swan pool , where they spiraled down into the drain and were lost to sight . " What ? " King Rainjoy whispered , shaking , rising to his feet . " What ? " " It was necessary , Majesty , " Gaunt said . " They had become mad . They meant you harm . " " We suspected , " Bone said , " that only in your presence could they die . " " Die , " echoed Rainjoy . He sank back onto the throne . Spawnsworth had gone pale , his cloak twitching in agitated spasms . But his voice was calm as he said , " I will wish to investigate the matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom a great , ah , service . It is not too late , I would say , to consider a reward . You sought my advice ? " Rainjoy cradled his head in his hands . " Alas , " said Gaunt , her eyes on the king , " our time with the tears has been instructive regarding your art . It is powerful , to be sure , but not suited to our problem . No offense is meant . " Spawnsworth frowned . " Then gold , perhaps ? jewels ? " Bone swallowed , but said nothing . " My king , " said the sorcerer , " what do you .... " Then he bit his lip . Rainjoy wept . " My king , " repeated Spawnsworth , looking more nonplused than when Salt , Mist , and Scald vanished down the drains . It was little more than a sparkling wetness along the left eye , a sheen that had barely begun to streak . Rainjoy wiped it with a silken sleeve . " It is nothing , " Rainjoy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the throne , ignoring Spawnsworth 's warning look . She touched Rainjoy 's shoulder . " It is something , " she said . He stared at her wide-eyed , like a boy . " It is simply .... I let them go for so long . I never imagined I would lose them forever . They did not obey . " " Oh my king , " Gaunt said , " my dear king . Tears can not obey . If they could , they would be saltwater only . " He held up the sleeve , dotted with a tiny wet stain . " I have tears again .... I do not deserve them . " " Yet here they are . Listen to them , King Rainjoy , even though these tears are mute . And never be parted from them . " The king watched as Gaunt returned to Bone 's side . The poet gave the thief one nod , and Imago Bone offered the king an unexpectedly formal bow , before the two clasped hands and walked slowly toward the door . Rainjoy thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaunt , will consist of a six-city larcenous spree which I shall now outline , and the poet 's answering laugh . Perhaps she cast a final look back , but the mists embraced her , and he would never be sure . He regretted it , that he 'd never be sure . " I am sad , Spawnsworth , " he said , wondering . " I do not sense life 's infinite sorrow . But I am sad . " But Spawnsworth did not answer , and the light in his eyes was not nascent tears but a murderous glint . He stalked up the stairs . In his tower there twitched a menagerie of personifications : howling griefs , snarling passions , a stormy nature blustering in a crystal dome , a dark night of the soul shrouding the glass of a mirror . In places there lurked experiments that twitched and mewled . Here a flower of innocence sprouted from the forehead of a gargoyle of cynicism . There a phoenix of renewal locked eyes forever with a basilisk of stasis . Spawnsworth arrived in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love 's betrayal and friendship 's gloom , the vials he would form into an instrument of revenge upon Gaunt and Bone . There came a cough behind him . He whirled and beheld three shining intruders . " We are not easily slain , as you should know , " Master Salt said . He opened a cage . " We , clearly , are more easily forgotten , " said Mistress Mist . She unstoppered a flask . " But we will see you never forget us , " said Sister Scald , pushing a glass sphere to shatter against the floor . " We believe you could use our counsel . Ah , I see there are many here who agree . " As his creations swarmed toward him , it occurred to Spawnsworth that the many grates in the floor , used to drain away blood and more exotic fluids , fed the same sewers as those in the hall of mists . " You can not do this , " he hissed . " You are Rainjoy 's , and he would never harm me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the tears said . He turned to flee , and felt his own cloak tremble with excitement and spill upward over his face . Of the many voices heard from the sorcerer 's tower that hour , the one most human , the palace servants agreed , was the one most frightening . When they found Spawnsworth 's body in the room of empty cages , all remarked how the face was contorted with sorrow , yet the eyes were dry .
