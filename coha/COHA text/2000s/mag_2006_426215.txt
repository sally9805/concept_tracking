We all have our inner demons to face , it 's just that some are more obvious than others . // How shall we improve ourselves ? Let us count the ways-or at least the New Year 's resolutions we 've made in a lifetime . Photograph // I 'm coming to the end of my creativity in this department . I 've lost weight ; adopted exercise regimes ; committed to recycling ; ended debilitating relationships ; vowed to read a book a month ; killed my TV ; stopped shopping as a form of entertainment ; and taken up in turns the breviary , the rosary , meditation , and daily Mass . I 've de-cluttered my closets , de-fragged my hard drive , and deconstructed my past from every angle . I think I 'm done now . I think I 've done it all . Which is not to say my life is now perfect , or that I am . Though I 'd like to think my life is in better shape today than , say , 20 years ago , the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuable goal . I 'm a sinner , to use the handy religious phrase . I 'm a flawed person living in a flawed world with a lot of other people who are n't doing so hot themselves . That does n't give me license to throw up my hands and " eat , drink , and be merry , " neglecting my responsibility to grow in holiness . But it does put perfection out of my reach . This is why I keep making resolutions ; I did n't say I keep them . Nothing in this world is perfect , despite first impressions . Remember the perfect apartment ? It had a great location , was delightfully antique , but there were not enough outlets for all contemporary pluggables . The perfect date ? Ah , he turned out to be a tiny bit of a psycho . The perfect haircut ? It grew out . The perfect job ? The management changed . The perfect climate ? That was until global warming .

I also accept that human expectations are going to meet with a fair amount of disappointment in this world . I even accept that I am going to prove disappointing to those in my life who expect better from me than I routinely deliver . We do n't have to be bad people to come up with some pretty inadequate behavior now and then . Simply put , we all fail to love as well as we ought . What possesses a basically decent person to fall so far short of the ideal ? I 'd like to find a reason ; I 'd settle for an excuse . Regrettably I do n't have one . I know better ! But that does n't necessarily make me live better . I read the Bible , yet still manage to think and act ill toward my fellow human beings . Sin is like a sickness I ca n't seem to shake . I harden my heart against the neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman who blocks the supermarket aisle with her shopping cart . I struggle with the desire for revenge when I read about violence perpetrated on innocent people . I feel the fear of unknown dangers spark the prejudice buried within me . I also suffer from a mild ambition to be in charge of the universe so that everything gets done the right way-my way . And that 's on a day when I 'm not misbehaving . CALL IT THE ST . PAUL BLUES , IF YOU LIKE . PAUL LAMENTS IN Romans 7 : " What I do , I do not understand . For I do not do what I want , but I do what I hate . " Ai n't it the truth , friends ? We do what we hate-no wonder we find ourselves so hard to love . Sin has a hold on our humanity in a way that seems at times like a possession . Is this what the Bible means by " having a demon " ? There are some 13 stories about demon possession involving Jesus , amounting to at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's gospel , interestingly , has no stories about demons , but Jesus is accused of being possessed by one on three separate occasions . ) It 's helpful to distinguish demons from devils here . Although we use the terms interchangeably-as does the New Testament in places-there is a clear distinction between the devil , or Satan , and the swarms of demons inhabiting folks in first-century Israel . The devil is the sinister fellow who tempts Jesus in the desert , causes Peter to reject the prediction of Jesus ' Passion , and later enters Judas to turn his heart toward betrayal . Theologically speaking , the devil is the absolute spirit of opposition to the cause of God , a diabolical weapon of mass destruction to the human soul . Falling in league with the devil is never a mistake . Only through the conscious selection of the human will over and against the divine will can such a spirit of evil " enter into " us . Literature has recruited this symbol in tales of meeting the devil at the crossroads at midnight or embracing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mortally desirable . No one hangs around the crossroads at midnight by accident . This is n't a matter of taking the wrong turn at Albuquerque . When we meet up with the devil , there 's no " oops " factor ; it 's always by design . Demonic possession , by comparison , does not seem to be a deliberate affair , or at least not entirely so . Two of the gospel stories , for example , involve the possession of children : the boy who throws himself in fire and water , and the Syrophoenician woman 's little girl . Can we say either of these children " asked " for their condition ? Some might quibble about the age of reason and wonder if they were at least 7 years old . But I 'd like to give these kids the benefit of the doubt and presume they were suffering from some form of physical or mental infirmity . Most contemporary scholarship regarding demon possession goes the route of categorizing it in terms of illness : epilepsy or schizophrenia , mania or bipolar disorder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gerasene demoniac , once bound in chains and now residing among the tombs , screaming about the legion inside of him , it 's hard not to think of mentally ill people we 've seen wandering city streets , shrieking out their madness inconsolably . The man who can not speak and the one both blind and mute obviously suffer from physical or mental trauma that doctors have been unable to repair . I knew an autistic boy very much like the one in the gospel , who was strangely attracted to fire and water and had to be restrained from hurling himself into danger regularly . None of these unfortunate individuals are persuasively wicked , though they might be capable of violence and destruction and were doubtless the cause of much unhappiness for those who loved them . All of which make them perfect candidates for an encounter with Jesus . YET HERE WE MAKE A CURIOUS OBSERVATION . IF THE DEMONpossessed are distinct from the devil-inhabited by the power of the will , then the demon sufferers might be separated from the rest of the distressed souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of all the sick and suffering multitudes that presented their need to Jesus , the demonpossessed never asked for a cure . Their malady prohibited such a request . Their parents came and begged Jesus for help ; or in the case of the speechless ones , friends brought them to Jesus and made the plea on their behalf . Those who had no friends , who hung out in cemeteries or synagogues-much like the mentally ill seek out churches today-did approach Jesus of their own volition , but only to accuse him of tormenting them or being the Son of God . The demon-afflicted seem afraid of Jesus-the boy goes into convulsions in his presence-but though they sense his power , they remain silent about their own need for healing . This is the point upon which we might distinguish our own unremarkable sinfulness or and the demon-sufferers . Most of us know we 're broken . And if we 're believers , we are both aware of Jesus ' healing authority and our own imperative to turn over our lives to it , inch by inch if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly seek that healing in the sacraments of Reconciliation , Anointing , and the premier sacrament of forgiveness , our Eucharist . We 're like the ones skittering up a tree to see Jesus as he comes into view , or grabbing at his clothes as he passes , or sitting down at table with him , sinners though we are , and sharing a meal . We know things are n't right with us and we need divine help . If you and I were demon-possessed in the biblical sense of the term , we would not seek a cure . In this sense , then , many of us do know people who fit the definition of demon possession . They are the family members locked in addiction . They are the friends who endure exhausting cycles of self-destructive choices because of early wounds that have never closed . They are the depressed ones who have neither therapist nor doctor . They are the moral drifters without spiritual moorings . They need our prayers because they need us to bring them to Jesus .
