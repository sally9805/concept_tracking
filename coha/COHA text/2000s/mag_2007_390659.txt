Hizzoner Loses to Whistle-Blowers Thirty-six-year-old Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has been bedeviled over the past five years by his share of scandals . Among them : a $25,000 bill to the city for his wife 's SUV . But nothing beats the lurid tale of affairs and coverup that led a jury last week to award two fired police officers $6.5 million in a whistle-blower suit against Kilpatrick and the city . The misdeeds began in 2003 , according to the officers ' lawyer Michael Stefani , when Officer Harold Nelthrope told the head of the force 's internal affairs unit , Gary Brown , about alleged misconduct among Kilpatrick 's bodyguards ( including helping the mayor have affairs ) and rumors of a wild bash with naked dancers at the mayor 's residence . Brown began a probe , but he and Nelthrope were let go shortly thereafter by the mayor . Kilpatrick has vowed to appeal the verdict , but every day he waits , the interest on the award grows . A Whirlwind in Record Time When Humberto stormed into Galveston , Texas , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 . But that was n't the only statistic that had experts buzzing . According to the National Hurricane Center in Miami , no recorded tropical cyclone had ever intensified so quickly near landfall . Over the course of 16 hours , the storm 's wind speed increased by an unprecedented 50 mph . To the experienced forecaster , rapid strengthening by hurricanes , especially out at sea , is nothing new . But this summer 's showing , even without Humberto 's feat , is looking downright zesty . Last month , for example , Hurricane Dean in the span of 36 hours intensified from 90 mph to 145 mph . Two weeks later , Hurricane Felix , which later slammed into Nicaragua , jumped 70 mph in a day . Scientists say they 're still grappling with the phenomenon . " We do n't understand everything with these storms , " says Dennis Feltgen of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . " We have a tremendous amount of research going on . " A Hate Crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hate crime ? When calling it something else could mean a tougher penalty for the accused . So said authorities last week when they announced that the federal government would not seek hate-crime charges against six white individuals accused of kidnapping and torturing a black woman in rural West Virginia . Twenty-year-old Megan Williams was rescued by police early this month after being held for more than a week in a dingy mobile home in Logan County , W.Va. , in what appears to have been a state of living hell . Williams told the press that her captors  --  three men and three women , all with prior criminal records  --  forced her to eat rat feces , lick blood , and drink water from a toilet . She also alleged that she was sexually abused , beaten , and stabbed repeatedly , often while being chastised with racial slurs . To establish grounds for pursuing a hate-crime charge , U.S. Attorney Charles Miller told U.S. News , officials would have needed to show that at least one of the victim 's " federally protected rights , " such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because of the possibility of a less severe penalty resulting from a hate-crime charge , federal authorities have deferred to state officials . Among other felony counts , the state has charged the suspects with kidnapping , which carries a maximum life sentence . Underage Brides Take On " Prophet " In a case that promises to shed more light on a culture that encourages multiple wives and underage brides , the trial of polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs got underway last week in St. George , Utah . Jeffs , the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , was charged with two felony counts of rape by accomplice for encouraging a 14-year-old girl  --  known simply as " Jane Doe "  --  to wed and copulate with her 19-year-old first cousin in 2001 . Doe was the first to take the stand and testified that Jeffs said her salvation was at stake if she refused to marry her cousin and to give herself over " mind , body , and soul " to her husband . Jeffs , who has dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormons . He is considered a prophet by followers . Facing state and federal charges , he was on the run for two years , ending up on the FBI 's most-wanted list with another controversial religious figure , Osama bin Laden . You Think Your Little Kid Is Bright ? He was as smart as your typical 5-year-old , able to count out loud to six and differentiate colors and shapes , rendering him quite the overachiever  --  for a parrot . Alex , an African Gray research parrot , died unexpectedly at 31 on September 6 , shocking colleagues . Researchers were so rattled that they held the details of the parrot 's demise until last week . Alex , whose name is an acronym for Avian Learning Experiment , was purchased at a Chicago pet store by scientist Irene Pepperberg , who was fascinated with studying the avian brain . Alex worked alongside Pepperberg at institutions around the country  --  most recently at Brandeis University in Waltham , Mass.  --  for 30 years . Alex , who could ask for treats and scorn researchers for overworking him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He proved that they 're not all birdbrains , after all .
