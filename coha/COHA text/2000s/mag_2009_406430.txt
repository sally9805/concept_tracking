An authentic seaman 's house is just what one young family has been waiting for . PHOTOGRAPHS BY MAURA MCEVOY STYLED BY RUBY BEETS DESIGN FOR A SMALL town on the bay side of the Hamptons , ostensibly north of where the action is , Sag Harbor has seen some pretty lively times . It 's been a staging post for the British Army in the Revolutionary War , a whaling hub in the 19th century and a 20th-century literary hangout for John Steinbeck , E.L . Doctorow and others . And yet it 's still home to those , like Rylan Jacka and his family , who relish living year-round in a community where , " if you do n't know the person , you recognize the face , " he explains . " There are artists , cabinetmakers , day traders  --  a pretty neat mix . And it 's a great place to raise kids . " Photograph : In the living room a neoclassical side chair from Bridgehampton 's Berns Fry joins a Chinese table and a steel bookshelf . " I 'm happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " adds Farrin Cary-Bay , Jacka 's wife . " But then I 'm so relieved to see the summer people because of the energy they bring ! " The couple and their daughters , Marrina , four , and Amaya , two , also look forward to the village 's specific-to-summer pleasures , from the ice-cream parlors to the Bay Street Theatre to the Dockside Bar &; Grill at the American Legion Hall , where every Tuesday night the neighborhood band performs . " We bring chairs and sit and listen , and the children run around and play , " says Cary-Bay . And almost every day , they make the most of such resources as the children 's park , dozens of locally owned shops along Main Street and the august brick library , all of which contribute to Sag Harbor life .

The family has lived in town since 2007 . As a vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with the Hamptons housing market and has bought and sold a few times himself : after starting out in East Hampton , he and his wife moved to Bridgehampton , which she found isolated in the off-season , especially after the arrival of Marrina . Photograph : The gray living room looks inviting as well as chic , thanks to white accents ( a FontanaArte lamp and an Empire-style table ) and a soft beige carpet , all from Ruby Beets Old &; New . Doubling as an office , the guest room is simply furnished with a wool carpet , a metal desk , and an tagre from Bridgehampton 's Laurin Copen Antiques . And so they began looking for a house in Sag Harbor , which has one of the East End 's largest full-time communities and a well-preserved downtown . " Farrin has always lived in old houses , and that was really important to her , " says Jacka . But the dwellings in Sag Harbor 's historic district  --  Georgians , Greek Revivals and Victorians , carefully tended to on their modest lots  --  rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're snapped up instantly . Not long after Amaya arrived , though , the couple got lucky , purchasing a pocket-sized seaman 's house that dates from 1810 , with 1991 additions that included a kitchen , sitting room and screened porch . Within stroller distance is Main Street " and the waterfront park where Marrina likes to fly her kite , " says her mother . " A carton of milk is a two-minute walk down the street . " The neighbors  --  including playwright Lanford Wilson , artist Donald Sultan and Jim Christensen , who works for Pulver Gas and lives in the house his great-grandmother owned  --  are just steps away . Located on a quiet side street , the house had settled on its lot and was listing badly . The couple discreetly inserted steel beams to reinforce the foundation . " We left the old locust posts in place just for history 's sake , " says Cary-Bay . Both she and her husband grew up in the Noe Valley section of San Francisco , in eminent Victorian houses , and the architectural decisions they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor , were always respectful . But their choices were designed to make the dwelling work for a modern family as well . Once they bought the property , Cary-Bay says she spent time weighing " all the things we needed , and what we did n't need . " Their previous Hamptons addresses were considerably larger than this compact jewel , whose interior measures just 2,000 square feet . But as a result of a clever renovation , " this is the most functional house I 've ever lived in , " she explains . " We do n't end up collecting things that migrate to the dark corners of the closets . " Photograph : Thonet-style chairs encircle a modern breakfast table in the dining area , where a photograph by Joseph Scheer sits on the mantel . The most visible change the pair made was to take down walls between the living , dining and guest rooms , allowing light to wash through the first floor from front to back . In addition , they glassed in the screened porch at the rear to create a playroom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French doors that open directly onto a garden . Where necessary , they replicated the style of the original wooden moldings and doors . " If I could n't keep something old , " says Cary-Bay , whose parents were antiques dealers , " I wanted the replacements to look handmade . " The nickel-plated bronze doorknobs from Emtek , for instance , could pass for hand forged . Even the most routine changes proved revelatory . When they broke into walls to add insulation , the couple discovered that " some had only old newspapers inside , " says Cary-Bay . " One wall had seaweed in it ; we even found old jars , like Pond 's Cold Cream .

For the interiors , Cary-Bay wanted a color palette that would evoke the past and be suitable for the house 's small scale ; she settled on shades of the ocean 's ever-shifting grays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls ( Benjamin Moore 's Iced Cube Silver , from its low-toxin Aura paint line ) in several rooms turn softly blue in the changing light and make the spaces feel larger . Original wide-planked pine floors , now stained a warm beachy silver and left for the most part uncarpeted , seem particularly old yet distinctly modern at the same time . Photograph : This space and the adjacent kitchen were both part of a 1991 addition to the house . When it came to furnishing the rooms , Sharone Einhorn , of Ruby Beets Design , and her partner , Honey Wolters , helped Cary-Bay achieve the eclecticism she felt would be true to her tastes and to Sag Harbor 's history as a port town . Einhorn 's shop , Ruby Beets Old &; New , is one of the stalwarts of the village , tucked right off Main Street . Photograph : The tiny master bedroom seems bigger with a mirrored headboard " Farrin had already chosen a beautiful palette , " the dealer says . " We talked to her about making the house look relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a young family , and using slipcovers because of the kids . " Ruby Beets provided key furnishings in most of the rooms , from 19th-century American antiques and comfortable seating to mirrors and other decorative details . The formal dining room , the serene center of the house and a natural passageway between the front door and the kitchen , remains luxuriously empty most of the time , with just an ebonized round table , a vase of flowers positioned on it and a bonnet-topped china cabinet . The adjacent living room , on the other hand , constantly lures family and friends , with its low Chinese table for drinks or games and easy-to-maintain , linen-covered sofa and chairs .

Upstairs the scale of the house becomes especially intimate , though it does n't seem to bother the family . " Originally , " says Cary-Bay , " this house had a birthing room as well as an enormous landing at the top of the stairs , where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redid the space to create a diminutive master bedroom and a cozy room for each girl , raised the ceilings where possible and laid down new floors of old wide-planked pine to match that on the first floor . In the summer , the Jackas eat outdoors on the terrace when they 're not picnicking elsewhere . They love to build a bonfire on the beach and roast marshmallows with a group of friends or go crabbing with the kids in nearby Sagaponack . " We bring a pot and a camper oven and cook dinner right by the water , " says Cary-Bay . Photograph : Amaya enjoys time with her toys on the dining room 's pine floor . The table , from Jayson Home &; Garden , complements Thonet-style chairs and a china cabinet , both local finds . Her husband , a former semipro soccer player and a four-season surfer , takes a firm view on such pleasures . " If you do n't sail or fish or surf or do something on the water , then you 're really not getting the East End life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
