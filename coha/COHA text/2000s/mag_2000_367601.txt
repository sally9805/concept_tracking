It is as if God placed upon the earth these tools  --  movie studios , television networks , telephone companies , record labels , cable companies , Internet providers  --  and then stood back and waited for silly mortals to figure out how they all fit together . Last week 's talk of a $35 billion purchase of Canada 's Seagram by France 's Vivendi represents the latest human attempt to make some of these pieces click into a seamless , revenue-generating new-economy Tinkertoy . The toy boys in this deal , Vivendi CEO Jean-Marie Messier , 43 , and Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr. , 45 , ca n't resist the urge to merge Vivendi 's telephone company , Internet provider and cable system with Seagram 's Universal Studios and Universal Music Group . <P> The idea here is similar to what compelled Viacom to buy CBS and AOL to merge with Time Warner : joining content with distribution . In some sense , it is technology  --  or fear of technological change  --  that is driving these partnerships . Who knows in the high-speed , always-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution , programming or cable , music or the means to get the tunes to the listener ? <P> The real convergence in this deal would be the alliance of Universal 's vast film and recorded music holdings with Vivendi 's sprawling Internet , pay-TV and software-publishing properties . Classics from Universal 's library of 24,000 TV episodes and more than 3,000 films , including such blockbusters as E.T . and Jurassic Park , could run on Vivendi 's majority-controlled Canal Plus subscription-TV service , the Continent 's largest . And Seagram 's Universal music group , currently the biggest on earth , could deliver Limp Bizkit and Sting to millions of European households via Vivendi 's 50%-controlled Vizzavi Internet portal . Such synergies will be enshrined forever  --  or at least until the next deal  --  in the proposed name of the merged colossus : Vivendi Universal . <P> The head of this new media power , Vivendi 's Messier , is a former civil servant who has undergone a new-economy makeover . When he took over the firm four years ago , it was primarily a water-and-waste management operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new economy ? Since then , he has been reconfiguring the company through a flurry of mergers and asset sales , shifting the product flow from water pipes to fat data pipes . After this deal goes through , he will probably spin off the remaining hydro assets to concentrate on whether or not he should green-light Erin Brockovich Deux or make Enrique Iglesias available in MPtrois format . <P> The merged Seagram , based in Montreal , would also shed some assets , bidding adieu to its wine and liquor empire , which features brands like Captain Morgan rum and Chivas Regal Scotch and could fetch anywhere from $5 billion to $10 billion . Bottled spirits are much too ancien regime  --  and besides , you ca n't download rum . The likely buyer : Britain 's Allied Domecq . <P> News of the talks follows hard on the heels of the mother of all such connections , the proposed $113 billion marriage of America Online and Time Warner , whose holdings include this magazine . And as in a Vivendi-Seagram deal , these hookups increasingly reach across borders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agreed to pay $12.5 billion for the U.S. portal Lycos ; the German media giant Bertelsmann will also be a partner .
