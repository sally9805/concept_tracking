Briana 's Gift By Lurlene McDaniel Random House Lurlene McDaniel one I 'm probably the only girl in the world who hates the month of December . I know Christmas comes in December , but so what ? Every bad , awful thing that 's ever happened in my family has happened in December . Like when I was five and Daddy died in an accident at the steel mill just two weeks before Christmas and we had to move to Tennessee and live with Grandma . And when I was eight and Mom was told in the first week of December she had rheumatoid arthritis and so she could n't work and had to set up her own at-home business . And when I was almost fourteen , my sister , Briana , ran away from home on a cold December Saturday , just after school let out for the holiday break . Mom said later , " I should have seen it coming . " But neither of us had . Our mother always said that Briana marched to the beat of a different drummer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band at school and staying in step is a must . When she was just sixteen , Bree took off with Jerry Stevens , a nineteen-year-old guy Mom called " worthless , hateful and without a lick of sense , " but that Bree swore she loved more than anything . Bree and Mom had lots of fights about Bree dating Jerry , and then on a Saturday morning when Mom had driven into town to Pruitt 's Food Mart for groceries , Bree comes down the stairs with two suitcases and a duffel bag and drops them at the front door . " Where you going ? " Iask . I 'm sprawled on the sofa watching a cartoon and eating Cheetos . I like the old cartoons ; plus , it 's a good way to spend a Saturday until Mom makes me do my chores , which was n't going to happen until she came home from the store . My fingers are covered with orange Cheetos dust and I lick them . Bree scowls . " That 's disgusting . " She looks out the high glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For where ? " " Los Angeles . " " Why ? " " Me and Jerry are going to find jobs . " " You do n't know anyone in Los Angeles , " I remind her . We live in farm country , in Duncanville , a small town in middle Tennessee , three hours from Nashville , only forty minutes from Chattanooga , which I guess Bree figures are both too close to home . " We 're going clear across country , seeing everything there is to see on the way . When we get to Hollywood , we 'll get a place of our own and be happy forever . " Her green eyes sparkle . " Mom 's not going to let you go . " Bree had taken off twice before and Mom had gotten the sheriff to fetch her home . " It 's different this time . " " How so ? " " I left a letter in my room . It explains everything . " " What about school ? " " I 'm finished with school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . " " But- " A horn honks outside and Bree throws open the door and grabs her bags . " I 'm out of here . " I follow her onto the front porch , stop when I see Jerry 's pickup in our dirt driveway . He jumps out , hugs Bree and tosses her bags into the open bed . " What did you pack , girl ? The kitchen sink ? " He never looks my way . Bree laughs and kisses him . She says to me , " Go inside , Sissy . " I 'm still wearing my sleep T-shirt and my legs and feet are bare . The cold has sliced right through me and frozen me to the porch . Bree shoots Jerry an apologetic look , runs back and puts her arms around me . " It 'll be all right , Sissy . I know what I 'm doing . " I feel all hollow , scared too . I do n't want my sister to leave . " I 'll send you postcards . " I stand still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to cry . I 'm careful not to touch her with my disgusting orange fingers . " Why do you want to leave ? " " I do n't want to be stuck in this place forever . This is my chance to go places with someone I love and who loves me . " The truck 's horn beeps and I see Jerry scowling from behind the wheel . Bree breaks away . " I ca n't keep Jerry waiting . " She bounds off the porch , runs to the truck , gets inside and rolls down the window . She calls out , " Tell Mom not to worry . I know what I want . I love you . " My voice is stuck in my throat and I ca n't say anything . I stand on the porch shivering and watch them drive away . And find another reason to hate December . When Mom comes home , I tell her what 's happened and we go up to Bree 's room together . The usually messy bedroom is neat and clean . The bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she died and the closet holds only old summer T 's and empty hangers . Mom picks up the letter propped on Bree 's pillow . As I watch her stiffened fingers rip open the envelope , I cry . " Shush , " she says , her eyes darting over the page . " Wh-what 's it say ? " " She and Jerry are getting married . " " Call the sheriff , Mom . You can stop them . " " Why ? Once they 're married , I have no say in her life . " " But school- " " She 's sixteen , Susanna . You ca n't stop a river from flowing downstream , and I ca n't stop Bree from going her own way . I should have seen it coming . " Shock waves roll over me . Briana is gone . Really and truly gone . Mom gets to her feet and her orthopedic shoes shuffle on the wood floor . " Come on now and help me bring in the groceries . " Bring in the groceries ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , has just run off to get married to a guy Mom hates ? I swipe at my eyes . Mom puts her arm around my shoulder . " She 'll be back , Sissy . " " When ? " " When he leaves her . " " But if they 're married . . . " " It 's a lot easier to break promises than to keep them , " Mom says . Her face looks sad . I still ca n't believe she is n't going to do anything to make Bree come back . " Come on now . " Mom shuts Bree 's bedroom door behind us and we go downstairs . by Lurlene McDaniel Excerpted by permission .
