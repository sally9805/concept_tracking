" People would say , " You 're never going to pull this off in that short period of time , ' ' " says Rouleau ( in Boston Harbor with Jan 's House of Hope ) . // To honor his late wife , Jerry Rouleau built house with some serious ocean views Jerry Rouleau likes to tell people he built a house on a fifth of an acre . True , but the acreage in question is a 150-ft. - by- 60- ft. barge , which at the moment is floating Rouleau 's house down the eastern seaboard from Portsmouth , N.H. , all the way to Norfolk , Va . " It will be the only house , " he also likes to say , " that is going to have eight zip codes . " Rouleau , 52 , hopes his waterborne home will claim another distinction : raising $10 million for charity in just a few months . Inspired after participating in a fund-raiser that involved the building of a log cabin inside the Mall of America near Minneapolis , Rouleau , a housing-industry marketing consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of building a fully landscaped house on a barge as a way to raise funds for charity . He chose cancer awareness as his cause in 1999 , after Jan , his wife of 27 years , died of lung cancer . Hence Jan 's House of Hope , which will benefit various cancer programs and hospitals . " I thought he was crazy , " says Jan 's sister Carol Fanara , 60 , of Rouleau and his plan . " But as he talked more about it I thought , He 's going to do it . ' And now , by God , he 's doing it . " Construction on the state-of-the-art seven-room , 3,100-sq. - ft. home-complete with cathedral ceilings , bamboo floors , $40,000 worth of stereo equipment and its own media room-wrapped up in May . Since then tugboats have towed the house 335 miles from its original dock in the waters of New Hampshire 's Piscataqua River to Boston , to Branford , Conn. , and then to New York City , three of seven planned stops .

( The rest of the $10 million will come from fund-raisers , auctions and other events held along the route . ) " It 's been fun , " says the cheerful Rouleau , who lived in an on-site motor home for more than two months during construction and worked some 18 hours a day supervising and sometimes pitching in . " I 'm not a builder , " he emphasizes . " I break into a sweat when they put a hammer in my hand . So I 'd sweep up after all the skilled people . " Though clearly a driven type , he 's not a worrier either . " He delegates that , " says his assistant Kelly Romigh . Photograph Jan Rouleau ( in 199 ) counseled others with cancer .

In 1997 Jan , a smoker until the early ' ' 90s , developed a bad cough that " lingered for months , " Rouleau recalls . She was diagnosed with lung cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes , and doctors estimated she had one month to live . Instead , Jan fought the disease for 2f years , continuing to travel with Rouleau to trade shows even while receiving chemotherapy every three weeks or so . " Jerry never left her side , " says her sister Carol . " He was wonderful to her . They were a very devoted couple . " Jan passed away just before a planned trip to Puerto Rico , and Rouleau scattered her ashes in the ocean near their former home in Westbrook , Conn . After that his pursuit of a memorial to her began in earnest . Ignoring skeptics , Rouleau sold his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in donated products and services and took a leave of absence from his work once construction kicked off in March . ( The home was assembled from six separate modules , which were trucked to the barge . ) In early June the finished home began its journey , floating only when the weather and tides are right . Rouleau himself enjoys no such breaks , driving to meet the house at each port and attending to every last detail of his realized dream . " My mother was always trying to get him to slow down , but if anything he 's working harder now , " says his son Jason , who took a semester off from college to help his father with the house . Rouleau , who next drives to Philadelphia to meet what he calls " the house that Jan built , " explains he is simply buoyed by this chance to honor his wife and help others who have cancer .
