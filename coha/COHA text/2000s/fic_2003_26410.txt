Let 's All Kill Constance Chapter One It was a dark and stormy night . Is that one way to catch your reader ? Well , then , it was a stormy night with dark rain pouring in drenches on Venice , California , the sky shattered by lightning at midnight . It had rained from sunset going headlong toward dawn . No creature stirred in that downfall . The shades in the bungalows were drawn on faint blue glimmers where night owls deathwatched bad news or worse . The only thing that moved in all that flood ten miles south and ten miles north was Death . And someone running fast ahead of Death . To bang on my paper-thin oceanfront bungalow door . Shocking me , hunched at my typewriter , digging graves , my cure for insomnia . I was trapped in a tomb when the hammering hit my door , midstorm . I flung the door wide to find : Constance Rattigan . Or , as she was widely known , The Rattigan . A series of flicker-flash lightning bolts cracked the sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen times : Rattigan . Forty years of triumphs and disasters crammed in one brown surf-seal body . Golden tan , five feet two inches tall , here she comes , there she goes , swimming far out at sunset , bodysurfing back , they said , at dawn , to be beached at all hours , barking with the sea beasts half a mile out , or idling in her oceanside pool , a martini in each hand , stark naked to the sun . Or whiplashing down into her basement projection room to watch herself run , timeless , on the pale ceiling with Eric Von Stroheim , Jack Gilbert , or Rod La Rocque 's ghosts , then abandoning her silent laughter on the cellar walls , vanishing in the surf again , a quick target that Time and Death could never catch . Constance . The Rattigan . " My God , what are you doing here ? " she cried , rain , or tears , on her wild suntanned face . " My God , " I said . " What are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east at a teachers ' conference . I 'm trying to finish my new novel . Our house , inland , is deserted . My old landlord said , your beach apartment 's empty , come write , swim . And here I am . My God , Constance , get inside . You 'll drown ! " " I already have . Stand back ! " But Constance did not move . For a long moment she stood shivering in the light of great sheets of lightning and the following sound of thunder . One moment I thought I saw the woman that I had known for years , larger than life , leaping into and jumping out of the sea , whose image I had witnessed on the ceiling and walls of her basement 's projection room , backstroking through the lives of Von Stroheim and other silent ghosts . Then , that changed . She stood in the doorway , diminished by light and sound . She shrank to a child , clutching a black bag to her chest , holding herself from the cold , eyes shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that Rattigan , the eternal film star , had come to visit in the midst of thunders . I finally said again , " Come in , come in . " She repeated her whisper , " Stand back ! " She swarmed on me , and with one vacuum-suction kiss , harassed my tongue like saltwater taffy , and fled . Halfway across the room she thought to come back and buss my cheek lightly . " Jeez , that 's some flavor , " she said . " But wait , I 'm scared ! " Hugging her elbows , she sogged down to dampen my sofa . I brought a huge towel , pulled off her dress , and wrapped her . " You do this to all your women ? " she said , teeth chattering . " Only on dark and stormy nights . " " I wo n't tell Maggie . " " Hold still , Rattigan , for God 's sake . " " Men have said that all my life . Then they drive a stake through my heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared ? " " Let 's see . " She sank back , exhausted . " I ran all the way from my place . I knew you were n't here , it 's been years since you left , but Christ , how great to find you ! Save me ! " " From what , for God 's sake ? " " Death . " " No one gets saved from that , Constance . " " Do n't say that ! I did n't come to die . I 'm here , Christ , to live forever ! " " That 's just a prayer , Constance , not reality . " " You 're going to live forever . Your books ! " " Forty years , maybe . " " Do n't knock forty years . I could use a few . " " You could use a drink . Sit still . " I brought out a half bottle of Cold Duck . " Jesus ! What 's that ? " " I hate scotch and this is el cheapo writer 's stuff . Drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grimaced . " Quick ! Something else ! " In our midget bathroom I found a small flask of vodka , kept for nights when dawn was far off . Constance seized it . " Come to Mama ! " She chugalugged . " Easy , Constance . " " You do n't have my death cramps . " She finished three more shots and handed me the flask , eyes shut . " God is good . " She fell back on the pillows . " You wan na hear about that damn thing that chased me down the shore ? " " Wait . " I put the bottle of Cold Duck to my lips and drank . " Shoot . " " Well , " she said . " Death . "
