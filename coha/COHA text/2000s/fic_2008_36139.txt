London , England , 1826 <p> The note was delivered by a scruffy child who did n't know he had the wrong house . The mistake was n't his fault . He had n't been told there were many different Malory houses in London . He 'd come to the first one he 'd been directed to , pleased that it had n't taken long to earn the few coppers in his pocket . And just as he 'd been told to do , he 'd run off before Henry could question him . <p> Henry and Artie , two crusty old sea dogs , had shared the job of butler at James Malory 's house ever since James had retired from his life at sea and they 'd both retired with him . But recently James had gone back to sea , briefly , to rescue his brother-in-law Drew Anderson , who 'd got himself into a coil when according to one of his crewmen who 'd managed to escape , pirates had stolen his ship right out of London harbor ! With him on it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sail with James for the rescue . Henry had lost . <p> Henry tossed the note without reading it onto the mountainous pile of calling cards and invitations that had come in from people who did n't know the Malorys of this particular household were n't in residence . A normal butler would never have let the tray on the hall table overflow with invitations and letters . But in the eight years since Henry and Artie had begun sharing the job , neither of them had learned how to be a proper butler . <p> That afternoon when Boyd Anderson returned to the Malory house in Berkeley Square , he found the note on his tray , along with a few other cards that had slid off the larger pile next to it . He did n't usually have a tray of his own in his sister Georgina 's house , but then he usually only visited for a week or two , never as long as several months as this visit had turned out to be . Nor was it the first time Georgina 's mail had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more thought , Boyd still had n't made up his mind yet about settling in England . But that was n't why he was still here . He had n't returned to sea yet because he was doing his sister a favor . Although Georgina had married into the large Malory family and any one of her numerous in-laws would have been delighted to take care of her children while she was gone , Georgina 's seven-year-old daughter , Jacqueline , balked at joining her young twin siblings at the country home of their cousin Lady Regina Eden , because she did n't want to be that far away from her best friend and cousin , Judith . Other Malorys in London could have taken her , but since Boyd was staying at her London house , Georgina had asked him to keep an eye on Jacqueline until he sailed again . <p> He would have preferred to go along for the rescue . That would have been a fine bit of work to tease his brother Drew about . But he had , in fact , done Georgina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband did n't get along well with any of her brothers , himself included . The man did n't even get along with his own brothers . And there was no way he and James Malory would n't come to blows if they ended up on a ship together . Besides , the look on James 's face when Boyd had suggested accompanying him , well , it had made Boyd glad he had an excuse to stay behind after all . <p> " We all know where she 'd rather stay , " Georgina had remarked . " But Roslynn mentioned in passing that she might be enceinte again , so she needs peace and quiet in her household just now , which wo n't be the case with Judy and Jack in residence . When you 're ready to sail will be soon enough to deposit her there . " <p> Roslynn Malory turned out not to be pregnant . Boyd ended up not sailing as expected . And Jack , as her father had named her at birth , was happy enough where she was , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often as she liked . <p> Boyd was n't exactly worried about Drew , anyway . Georgina did enough worrying for all of them . But Boyd knew his brother well and had no doubt that he 'd extricate himself from whatever trouble he 'd gotten into long before Georgina and her husband arrived to help . Hell , considering how long they 'd been gone , he was beginning to suspect they had n't even caught up to Drew 's ship yet ! <p> Georgina had n't expected Boyd to stay in London this long . No one had , himself included . But when his ship , The Oceanus , returned from the short run he 'd sent her on , instead of leaving with her , he sent her off again . And gave more thought to giving up the sea for good . <p> The Andersons ' family business , Skylark Shipping , also had an office in London now . While the family had avoided England for many years due to the old war and the hard feelings that had ensued from that , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , now that England was central to all of their newly acquired routes , the London office had grown considerably in the last eight years . Boyd would n't half mind taking over the running of it . <p> Become landlocked ? God , why did n't he just do it already ? Because oddly enough , he loved the sea . He just hated what it did to him . <p> Georgina had introduced him to London society more than once on his visits here . He even kept a wardrobe at her house specifically for his London stays that was more appropriate for a gentleman , since the English dressed quite a bit more fancily than sailors did ! He did n't go excessive in frilly cravats or lacy cuffs as some of them did . In fact , he took a cue from his brother-in-law , James  --  well-tailored , but subdued and even open-collared . And he had a few velvet jackets that spruced him up for evening social events . <p> On this extended visit he 'd been receiving invitations to balls and soirTes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and he 'd occasionally accepted . He was n't actively looking for a wife , but if the right woman showed up , that would be incentive to settle down . He 'd thought he 'd found her . Katey Tyler would have been the perfect woman for him  --  if she was n't already taken ! <p> God , how did he let her sneak into his mind again ? Once she did , it took days and a good bout of drinking to get her out again . But only briefly . She was somewhere in his thoughts more often than not . It seemed that knowing he could n't have her because she already had a husband made him want her even more ! He 'd never been able to figure out what exactly it was about Katey Tyler that had twisted him inside out on that voyage . She was n't even the kind of woman that usually caught his eye . <p> She was too tall for one thing , only a few inches shorter than he was . He preferred to feel tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give him that feeling when she stood eye to eye with him . But it did n't matter . One look at her lushly abundant curves and nothing else mattered . <p> She could talk a lot  --  about nothing . That was a remarkable feat . Even more remarkable , he 'd never found that annoying ! Her dimples often made her seem like she was smiling when she was n't . And she contradicted herself a lot , which could be quite confusing , but he actually found that endearing . It made her seem charmingly absentminded . Her nose was slim , almost patrician , her brows rather thin , her mouth  --  he could never think about her mouth without becoming aroused . <p> No woman had ever affected him like that before , or stayed in his thoughts this long . <p> Gabrielle Brooks had caught his interest though . What a relief that had been , assuring him that he was n't a lost cause ! She could have banished Katey from his mind  --  well , that had been his original hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did and had become Georgina and James 's houseguest because her father , an old friend of James 's , had asked James to sponsor her for the Season . <p> A pretty thing , Gabby could have turned his thoughts toward marriage if Drew had n't been taken with her , too . Not that his carefree brother ever intended to get leg-shackled , as the English put it . But Gabby seemed to be fascinated with Drew , too , so Boyd had stopped thinking about her as a possible wife . Besides , she was the daughter of a pirate , as it turned out , and Boyd would have had a hard time getting past that simple fact . Pirates were the nemesis of honest sailors . <p> He glanced at the two invitations on his tray that were actually for him and carefully put back the four that were addressed to his sister . He opened the folded note since he could n't tell whom that was for . He had to read it twice before the meaning sank in . And then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he found Jacqueline in her room , the color returned to his cheeks and his heart slowly returned to its normal beat . He read the note once more . <p> I have your daughter . Start gathering a fortune if you want her back . You 'll be told where to bring it . <p> Boyd shoved the note in his pocket , deciding it had obviously been delivered to the wrong house . He wondered if any of Georgina 's neighbors had daughters . He did n't know , but he 'd have to take that note to the authorities . <p> " What 's wrong , Uncle ? " <p> Glancing at Jack 's woebegone expression , Boyd replied , " I could ask you the same thing . " <p> She started to shrug , but then she sighed and said , " Judy 's riding her first horse today in Hyde Park . Not a pony , a real horse Uncle Tony bought her . " <p> " And you were n't invited to watch ? " he guessed . <p> " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with her . He 's so been looking forward to it . " <p> Boyd managed to stifle a grin . His niece was only seven years old , but sometimes she amazed him with her insight and consideration for others . She obviously wanted to be in the park watching her best friend ride her first real horse , but she 'd taken the girl 's father 's feelings into account instead . <p> Boyd had known about the outing and had been afraid that Jack would feel left out . He 'd actually considered buying her a horse as well , but then he realized his sister might have a fit if he did . Actually , it was James 's likely reaction that had decided him against it . If Sir Anthony had been looking forward to seeing his daughter 's excitement upon riding her first real horse , James was probably looking forward to the same . <p> " Besides , " Jacqueline added . " Judy 's coming over tonight to spend the weekend , so I 'll be hearing  --  " <p> She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he 'd run up the stairs just as Boyd had done . Without saying what had brought him upstairs in such a hurry , he glanced at the daughter of the house then motioned for Boyd to come out into the corridor . Henry knew that small children had big ears , and this was one thing he was going to make absolutely sure Jack did n't overhear . <p> " A messenger just came from Sir Anthony , " Henry whispered urgently in Boyd 's ear . " ' E 's asked for every man in the ' ouse to come and ' elp ' im search for ' is daughter . She 's gone missing in the park . " <p> " Damn , " Boyd said , and pulled Henry downstairs with him before he showed the old salt the note . <p> It made sense now . The note had n't been delivered to the wrong house on the street , just the wrong Malory house , which mistake happened frequently with eight separate Malory households in the city . <p> " A search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly . " But I need to get this note to Sir Anthony immediately . " <p> " Bleedin ' ' ell , the cap'n is going to be furious ' e ai n't ' ere to ' elp . " <p> Boyd did n't doubt that the captain Henry referred to was James Malory . The two younger Malory brothers were quite close , just as Boyd was close to Drew and Georgina , they being the three youngest in their family . <p> " Then I 'll just have to represent him , " Boyd said as he rushed out of the house . <p> Copyright 2008 by Johanna Lindsey <br> Continues ...
