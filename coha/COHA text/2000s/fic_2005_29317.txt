It gets dark early in Algonquin Bay . Take a drive up Airport Hill at four o'clock on a February afternoon and when you come back half an hour later , the streets of the city will glitter below you in the dark like so many runways . The forty-sixth parallel may not be all that far north ; you can be much further north and still be in the United States , and even London , England , is a few degrees closer to the North Pole . But this is Ontario , Canada , we 're talking about , and Algonquin Bay in February is the very definition of winter : Algonquin Bay is snowbound , Algonquin Bay is quiet , Algonquin Bay is very , very cold . John Cardinal was driving home from the airport where he had just watched his daughter , Kelly , board a plane bound for the United States by way of Toronto . The car still smelled of her-or at least of the scent that had lately become her trademark : Rhapsody or Ecstasy or some such . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled of loneliness . It was many degrees below zero outside ; winter squeezed the car in its grip . The windows of the Camry were frosted up on both sides , and Cardinal had to keep scraping them with an ineffective plastic blade . He went south down Airport Hill , made a left onto the bypass , another left onto Trout Lake Road , and then he was heading north again toward home . Home , if you could call it that with both Catherine and Kelly gone , was a tiny wooden house on Madonna Road , smallest among a crescent of cottages set like a brooch along the north shore of Trout Lake . Cardinal 's house was fully winterized , or so the real estate agent had told them , but " winterized " had turned out to be a relative term . Kelly claimed you couldstore ice cream in her bedroom . His drive was hidden by four-foot-high snowbanks , so Cardinal did n't see the car blocking his way until he almost rear-ended it . It was one of the unmarkeds from work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal reversed and parked across the road . Lise Delorme , the Algonquin Bay police department 's entire Office of Special Investigations , got out of the unmarked and waded through the exhaust toward him . The department , despite " great strides toward employment equity , " as the bureaucrats liked to phrase it , was still a bastion of male chauvinism , and the general consensus around the place was that Lise Delorme was too-well , too something-for her job . You 're at work , you 're trying to think , you do n't need the distraction . Not that Delorme looked like a movie star ; she did n't . But there was something about the way she looked at you , McLeod liked to say-and for once McLeod was right . Delorme had a disturbing tendency to hold your gaze just a little too long , just a split second too long , with those earnest brown eyes . It was as if she 'd slipped her hand inside your shirt . In short , Delorme was a terrible thing to do to a married man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was about to give up , " she said . Her French Canadian accent was unpredictable : one hardly noticed it most of the time , but then final consonants would disappear and sentences would sprout double subjects . " I tried to phone you , but there was no answer , and your machine , it 's not working . " " I switched it off , " Cardinal said . " What the hell are you doing here , anyway ? " " Dyson told me to come get you . They 've found a body . " " Got nothing to do with me . I do n't work homicides , remember ? " Cardinal was trying to be merely factual , but even he could hear the bitterness in his voice . " You mind letting me through , Sergeant ? " The " Sergeant " was just to nettle her . Two detectives of equal rank would normally address each other by name , except in the presence of the public or around junior officers . Delorme was standing between her car and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his garage door . " Well Dyson , I think he wants you back . " " I do n't care . You mind backing out now , so I can plug my car in ? I mean , if that 's okay with Dyson . Why 's he sending you , anyway ? Since when are you working homicides ? " " You must have heard I quit Special . " " No , I heard you wanted to quit Special . " " It 's official now . Dyson says you 'll show me the ropes . " " No , thanks . I 'm not interested . Who 's working Special ? " " He 's not here yet . Some guy from Toronto . " " Fine , " Cardinal said . " Does n't make the slightest difference . You gon na get lost now ? It 's cold , I 'm tired , and I 'd kind of like to eat my supper . " " They think it could be Katie Pine . " Delorme scanned his face while Cardinal took this in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , staring out into the blackness that was Trout Lake . In the distance the headlights of two snowmobiles moved in tandem across the dark . Katie Pine . Thirteen years old . Missing since September 12 ; he would never forget that date . Katie Pine , a good student , a math whiz from the Chippewa Reserve , a girl whom he had never met , whom he had wanted more than anything to find . The phone began to ring inside the house , and Delorme looked at her watch . " That 's Dyson . He only gave me one hour . " Cardinal went inside . He did n't invite Delorme . He picked up the phone on the fourth ring and heard Detective Sergeant Don Dyson going on at him in his chilly quack of a voice as if they had been separated in the middle of an argument and were only now , three months later , resuming it . In a way , that was true . " Let 's not waste time going over old ground , " Dyson said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There . Done . We got a body out on the Manitou Islands , and McLeod is tied up in court . Up to his ears in Corriveau . Case is yours . " Cardinal felt the old anger burning its way into his veins . I may be a bad cop , he told himself , but not for the reasons Dyson thinks . " You took me off homicide , remember ? I was strictly robbery and burglary material , in your book . " " I changed your case assignments , it 's what a detective sergeant does , remember ? Ancient history , Cardinal . Water under the bridge . We 'll talk about it after you see the body . " " ' She 's a runaway , ' you said . ' Katie Pine is not a homicide , she 's a runaway . Got a history of it . ' " " Cardinal , you 're back on homicide , all right ? It 's your investigation . Your whole stinking show . Not that it has to be Katie Pine , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an open mind about identifying bodies you have n't seen . But if you want to play I Told You So , Cardinal , you just come into my office tomorrow morning , eight o'clock . Best thing about my job is I do n't have to go out at night , and these calls always come at night . " " It 's my show as of this momentif I go . " " That 's not my decision , Cardinal , and you know it . Lake Nipissing falls under the jurisdiction of our esteemed brothers and sisters in the Ontario Provincial Police . But even if it 's the OPP 's catch , they 're going to want us in on it . If it is Katie Pine or Billy LaBelle , they were both snatched from the city-our city-assuming they were both snatched . It 's our case either way . ' If I go , ' he says . " " I 'd rather stick with burglaries , unless it 's my show as of this moment . " " Have the coroner toss a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal yelled to Delorme , who had stepped in out of the cold and was standing diffidently just inside the kitchen door . " Which one of the Manitous are we on ? " " Windigo . The one with the mine shaft . " " So we drive , right ? Will the ice take a truck ? " " You kidding ? This time of year , that ice would take a freight train . " Delorme jerked a mittened thumb in the direction of Lake Nipissing . " Make sure you dress warm , " she said . " That lake wind , it 's cold as hell . "
