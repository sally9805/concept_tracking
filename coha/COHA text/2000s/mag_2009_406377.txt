SLOW TO GROW My one-year-old is very small . She was average size at birth , but started dropping on her growth chart when she was four months old . She has been tested for cystic fibrosis and the paediatrician seems to think everything is fine , but I 'm still worried . * Doctors closely follow children 's height and weight , as these tell us in a general way if a child is healthy and her body is working properly . If these measurements are consistent with your family 's growth pattern , and the child generally remains on the same percentile and is active and developing normally , it 's a good sign she 's just fine . If that 's the case , we can blame her small size on genetics . On the other hand , the list of causes for slow growth is a long one , but many are treatable . Falling off these expected percentiles can be due to poor intake ; too much output ( lots of loose or fatty stools , or vomiting ) ; or her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear idea of how many calories your child takes in each day as well as her output . If your daughter is taking in sufficient amounts and is still not gaining weight , further assessment needs to be done , perhaps by a specialist . If you 've communicated your concern , to the paediatrician and he ca n't explain the situation , it may be time for a second opinion . - Diane Sacks , paediatrician EARLY RISER My 2 - year- old goes to bed every night at 8 p.m. , but he wakes up at around 5:15 a.m. and ca n't get back to sleep . We 've cut back his nap , but it seems to be making the problem worse . We 've tried a timer on a lamp that goes on at 6 a.m. , when he 's allowed to get out of bed , but most times he gets out of bed way too early , and he often wakes his brother . It seems he does n't get it or just wants the attention of getting us up . Any suggestions ? * There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds as if your son is one of them . As he gets older and can be trusted to play with toys quietly , it 's going to get easier . In the meantime , you need to accommodate his early rising and figure out ways to handle it . Could he crawl into bed with you until 6 a.m. ? That would allow him to be safe and all of you to get a bit more sleep . Is there anything you can give him to do quietly in his bed until the rest of you wake up ? Another idea is for you and your partner to take turns getting up early with him . If you can get past how outrageously early it is , you may even find this nice one-on-one time to spend with him . - Kathy Lynn , parent educator AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR From a very young age , my four-year-old son has had aggression issues . When he was a toddler , his doctor assured me that his biting was normal , but my son started school this year and I 'm afraid he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy pulling my hair and pinching me , and will usually lash out verbally when I tell him to stop . His behaviour worries me and I 'm considering having him psychologically evaluated . Do you have any advice ? * In young children , aggression is often a mask for fear , anger and other negative emotions . It may be your son 's way of trying to master his fears and feel more powerful . Try reading books about feelings with him , talk to him about his feelings , and model the behaviour you want him to use - practise describing your own feelings . This will help him develop the vocabulary he needs to be able to describe how he feels . Most children your son 's age have n't developed empathy yet , but he will learn it by feeling understood by you . Over time , he 'll become less aggressive as he learns other ways to deal with feeling angry or scared . Consider also that your son 's negative behaviour probably triggers angry responses from the adults in his life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also needs you to remain calm when he becomes aggressive . Avoid getting into power struggles with him , and be careful not to respond with overly harsh punishment . If you try these suggestions and you continue to have concerns , consider seeking help from a qualified mental health practitioner . - Ruwa Sabbagh , psychotherapist IMAGINARY FRIENDS Sprinkles , my six-year-old 's imaginary friend , has been with us for more than four years . About six months ago , my son realized Sprinkles had left him and he was distraught . Eventually he got over it , but today he whispered in my ear that Sprinkles is back . At what age do imaginary friends leave a child and should I do anything about this ? * It is quite normal to have an imaginary friend at your son 's age - so you do n't really need to do anything . These relationships usually end sometime during primary school . Imaginary friends can be important in developing a healthy imagination and are more common in first-born and only children . You might find that Sprinkles disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that your son will stop telling you about him . You are right to wonder if there could be something up with Sprinkles ' departure and recent return . Consider whether someone important in your son 's life was lost around the time Sprinkles disappeared . Sometimes fantasies about imaginary friends mirror real-life events the child is trying to manage . Perhaps Sprinkles ' revival suggests a wish for the return of someone close . Alternatively , maybe your son is trying to deal with increased stress right now and needed to bring Sprinkles back to help him cope . RS PERFORMANCE ANXIETY My nine-year-old daughter takes dancing and music lessons , and says she enjoys them . But in the week leading up to a performance or exam , she becomes anxious and withdrawn , sometimes bursting into tears when we least expect it . How can we help her deal with the stress ? I 've considered taking her out of lessons , but she says she loves it . * I suggest talking to her instructors to find out how they prepare their students for performances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . Let them know how anxious your daughter is ; maybe they can help by being more positive . If the problem continues and you believe the instructor is at the root , find another class . In the meantime , try teaching your daughter how to calm herself with deep breathing . Ensure she 's getting other good exercise , such as playing outside . While dance is exercise , it 's not free play and she may need that to reduce her stress . KL PAIN IN THE FOOT My 13-year-old son has been complaining of foot pain lately . None of his shoes seem comfortable and it 's gotten so bad , he can only wear his Crocs . What 's going on ? * Pain is the body 's signal that something is wrong ; if it 's interfering with his activities , you need to talk to his doctor . There are a few things that might be happening here . To figure out what 's going on , the doctor should ask where the pain is located , if it hurts when he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain is worse with activity . Although juvenile bunions are more common in teen girls , boys can also get them . They are usually a firm swelling that appears on the outside of the big toe ( often Mom has them too ) . Bunions are typically associated with flat feet and a youngster who is loose jointed . Shoes and shoe adaptations ( orthotics ) may help . Or the problem could be painful callouses or even inflamed swelling over the second toe , which may require shoe adaptations . Depending on the cause , these problems may need more aggressive treatment and , although rare in children , even surgery . Finally , it 's possible your son has caused some stress fractures of the foot bones with aerobic sports activity . If that 's the case , rest and sometimes walking casts are needed .
