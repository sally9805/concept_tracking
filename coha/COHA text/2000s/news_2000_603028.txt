<p> Not counting transplanted organs , an estimated one in 10 Americans are walking around with body parts they were n't born with . <p> Intraocular lenses replace those clouded by cataracts . Dental implants substitute for teeth gone bad . Artificial hips get individuals crippled by arthritis back on the dance floor . <p> " We 're all going to leave Planet Earth part synthetic , " notes Robert Baier , executive director of the industry/University Center for Biosurfaces at the State University of New York at Buffalo . <p> Despite the pervasiveness of medical implants , though , Americans are more likely to learn that their car brakes might fail than their artifical joint might give out . <p> In the USA , as in most countries , there is no systematic tracking of who gets what medical implants and how well such devices wear . Most recipients are never told the make and model of their implants . <p> At a National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) meeting this week , the chief executive of a leading maker of orthopedic implants noted that doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed product information  --  until they unwrap the device in the operating room . <p> " We sort of concluded that 's where we ought to keep our trade secrets , because nobody reads that stuff , " says Dane Miller , CEO of Biomet Inc. in Warsaw , Ind . <p> The situation is particularly worrisome when one considers that the manufacturers of many , if not most , medical implants won Food and Drug Administration approval to market their devices without first having to submit clinical data about their products ' safety and effectiveness . <p> After the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device was linked to more than a dozen deaths and dozens of miscarriages , Congress passed legislation in 1976 that for the first time gave the FDA authority to regulate implants and other medical devices . <p> But devices already on the market were grandfathered in . And most newer products have been approved under a paragraph of the legislation that allows companies to bring devices to market simply by showing that they are " substantially equivalent " to what 's already being sold . <p> " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " David Feigal , head of the FDA branch that regulates devices , said at the NIH conference , which focused on medical implants . <p> Instead , Feigal says , an implant typically gets approved if the manufacturer can show " it wo n't be any worse than anything already on the market . " <p> The FDA can call for safety and effectiveness data once an implant is on the market , but it usually does n't , Baier says . <p> " What we face is the consequence of a failure of public and professional leadership , " says Baier , a biomaterials engineer who criticizes his own profession as well as physicians , manufacturers and government agencies . " It 's just a scientific disgrace that we have not gathered data on these scientific experiments we have conducted on our population . " <p> Registry , protocols <p> For years , Baier has been in the forefront of efforts to develop an implant tracking system . It would include a registry of patients who receive implants and protocols for retrieving implants that have been removed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool to the notion of a third party studying explants . They fear it could trigger even more lawsuits by patients or their families over implant imperfections . <p> Proponents argue that systematic follow-up of implants could avert medical disasters like the Bjork-Shiley heart valve and the lawsuits that ensue . <p> The Bjork-Shiley valve had a tendency to fracture , causing death or serious injuries to hundreds of patients . <p> Medic Alert , a foundation that maintains registries of people with various health problems , had to be enlisted in the early 1990s to help track down and alert the 23,000 surviving U.S. patients who unknowingly carried that particular model in their hearts . <p> If a registry had been in place when the first Vitek device was implanted in 1983 to treat a condition called temporomandibular joint disorder ( TMJ ) , evidence of joint destruction and other problems would have been available within six months and the device 's use halted , says Terrie Cowley , president of the TMJ Association , a Milwaukee-based patient advocacy group . <p> Instead , the implant , intended to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained on the market until 1990 . A decade later , Cowley says , patients still call the TMJ Association asking how they 're supposed to find out whether they have that particular implant . <p> The Vitek disaster spurred DuPont , a major developer and supplier of raw materials used in implants , to forbid companies from using its products for medical purposes . <p> The quarter-size Vitek implant contained about a nickel 's worth of DuPont 's Teflon , says Ross Schmucki , a DuPont attorney . After Vitek went bankrupt , plaintiffs turned on DuPont , he says . Although 56 courts ruled that DuPont was not at fault and should n't be sued , the company was hit with more than 650 lawsuits , he says . <p> Schmucki spent eight years successfully defending the company  --  all over less than $ 50 worth of Teflon . " That is not a positive reinforcement for supplying raw materials , " Schmucki told participants at the NIH meeting . <p> Shortage concerns <p> Baier says he 's concerned that problems with other implants  - -  problems that could be avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of supplying raw materials , leading to a critical shortage . <p> For now , Baier says , most explants are discarded and implants buried , taking valuable information with them . Even after all the controversy about silicone breast implants , he notes , no one has systematically collected and studied those that have been removed . <p> Implant retrieval currently occurs only on a piecemeal basis . Some manufacturers collect explants for analysis , although many companies are far too small to do the job . A few academic research centers retrieve explants for study , sometimes with the financial support of manufacturers . <p> At the Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , for example , Frederick Shoen , director of cardiac pathology , serves as a consultant for several heart valve manufacturers . <p> He studies valves removed at autopsy at his institution and others , trying to determine why they failed . Although he is paid by manufacturers , Shoen says , he is free to publish whatever he finds , good or bad . <p> Schoen 's research has shown that calcium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to the development of preventive steps . <p> Recommendations <p> At this week 's NIH meeting , Schoen and Baier , along with other engineers , physicians , manufacturers , patients and government officials , presented their views to an expert panel convened by NIH to develop recommendations . The panel Wednesday concluded that a universal implant data bank " appears to be prohibitively expensive just now . " <p> Instead , the panel called for educational efforts to better inform patients about their implants . <p> " Society and patient expectations of the risks and benefits of medical implants are often unrealistic , especially as to the life span of the implant , " the panel noted in a statement . <p> " There 's a sense that if the FDA approves it , it 's perfect , " says panel co-chair Edward Brandt , director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center . <p> The NIH and the FDA should collaborate on a Web site with links to databases of devices , the panel recommended . In addition , patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as make , model and serial number . <p> The card should also serve as a kind of donor consent form , alerting medical authorities to the patient 's desire to have the implant removed for research purposes after death . <p> Panel member William Wulf , president of the National Academy of Engineering , added a cautionary note . Information gathered from retrieved implants would provide information mainly about devices introduced years earlier , Wulf says . <p> " I think we have to be very careful not to make it appear to consumers that we can give them reliable information about today 's products .

Most artificial joints last at least 10 years ; few last longer than 15.
