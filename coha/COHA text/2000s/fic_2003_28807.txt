The Gift of Cochise Tense , and white to the lips , Angie Lowe stood in the door of her cabin with a double-barreled shotgun in her hands . Beside the door was a Winchester ' 73 , and on the table inside the house were two Walker Colts . Facing the cabin were twelve Apaches on ragged calico ponies , and one of the Indians had lifted his hand , palm outward . The Apache sitting the white-splashed bay pony was Cochise . Beside Angie were her seven-year-old son Jimmy and her five-year-old daughter Jane . Cochise sat his pony in silence ; his black , unreadable eyes studied the woman , the children , the cabin , and the small garden . He looked at the two ponies in the corral and the three cows . His eyes strayed to the small stack of hay cut from the meadow , and to the few steers farther up the canyon . Three times the warriors of Cochise had attacked this solitary cabin and three times they had been turned back . In all , they had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponies had been killed . His braves reported that there was no man in the house , only a woman and two children , so Cochise had come to see for himself this woman who was so certain a shot with a rifle and who killed his fighting men . These were some of the same fighting men who had outfought , outguessed and outrun the finest American army on record , an army outnumbering the Apaches by a hundred to one . Yet a lone woman with two small children had fought them off , and the woman was scarcely more than a girl . And she was prepared to fight now . There was a glint of admiration in the old eyes that appraised her . The Apache was a fighting man , and he respected fighting blood . Whereis your man ? He has gone to El Paso . Angie 's voice was steady , but she was frightened as she had never been before . She recognized Cochise from descriptions , and she knew that if he decided to kill or capture her it would be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off had been those of casual bands of warriors who raided her in passing . He has been gone a long time . How long ? Angie hesitated , but it was not in her to lie . He has been gone four months . Cochise considered that . No one but a fool would leave such a woman , or such fine children . Only one thing could have prevented his return . Your man is dead , he said . Angie waited , her heart pounding with heavy , measured beats . She had guessed long ago that Ed had been killed but the way Cochise spoke did not imply that Apaches had killed him , only that he must be dead or he would have returned . You fight well , Cochise said . You have killed my young men . Your young men attacked me . She hesitated , then added , They stole my horses . Your man is gone . Why do you not leave ? Angie looked at him with surprise . Leave ? Why , this is my home . This land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . This was an Apache spring , Cochise reminded her reasonably . The Apache lives in the mountains , Angie replied . He does not need this spring . I have two children , and I do need it . But when the Apache comes this way , where shall he drink ? His throat is dry and you keep him from water . The very fact that Cochise was willing to talk raised her hopes . There had been a time when the Apache made no war on the white man . Cochise speaks with a forked tongue , she said . There is water yonder . She gestured toward the hills , where Ed had told her there were springs . But if the people of Cochise come in peace they may drink at this spring . The Apache leader smiled faintly . Such a woman would rear a nation of warriors . He nodded at Jimmy . The small onedoes he also shoot ? He does , Angie said proudly , and well , too ! She pointed to an upthrust leaf of prickly pear . Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred yards away , and the Winchester was long and heavy , but he lifted it eagerly and steadied it against the doorjamb as his father had taught him , held his sight an instant , then fired . The bud on top of the prickly pear disintegrated . There were grunts of appreciation from the dark-faced warriors . Cochise chuckled . The little warrior shoots well . It is well you have no man . You might raise an army of little warriors to fight my people . I have no wish to fight your people , Angie said quietly . Your people have your ways , and I have mine . I live in peace when I am left in peace . I did not think , she added with dignity , that the great Cochise made war on women ! The Apache looked at her , then turned his pony away . My people will trouble you no longer , he said . You are the mother of a strong son . What about my two ponies ? she called after him . Your young men took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and the little cavalcade of riders followed him away . Angie stepped back into the cabin and closed the door . Then she sat down abruptly , her face white , the muscles in her legs trembling . When morning came , she went cautiously to the spring for water . Her ponies were back in the corral . They had been returned during the night . Slowly , the days drew on . Angie broke a small piece of the meadow and planted it . Alone , she cut hay in the meadow and built another stack . She saw Indians several times , but they did not bother her . One morning , when she opened her door , a quarter of antelope lay on the step , but no Indian was in sight . Several times , during the weeks that followed , she saw moccasin tracks near the spring . Once , going out at daybreak , she saw an Indian girl dipping water from the spring . Angie called to her , and the girl turned quickly , facing her . Angie walked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Apache girl left . And the following morning there was another quarter of antelope on her stepbut she saw no Indian . Ed Lowe had built the cabin in West Dog Canyon in the spring of 1871 , but it was Angie who chose the spot , not Ed . In Santa Fe they would have told you that Ed Lowe was good-looking , shiftless , and agreeable . He was , also , unfortunately handy with a pistol . Angie 's father had come from County Mayo to New York and from New York to the Mississippi , where he became a tough , brawling river boatman . In New Orleans , he met a beautiful Cajun girl and married her . Together , they started west for Santa Fe , and Angie was born en route . Both parents died of cholera when Angie was fourteen . She lived with an Irish family for the following three years , then married Ed Lowe when she was seventeen . Santa Fe was not good for Ed , and Angie kept after him until they started south . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the old Spanish ruin in West Dog . Here there were grass , water , and shelter from the wind . There was fuel , and there were pions and game . And Angie , with an Irish eye for the land , saw that it would grow crops . The house itself was built on the ruins of the old Spanish building , using the thick walls and the floor . The location had been admirably chosen for defense . The house was built in a corner of the cliff , under the sheltering overhang , so that approach was possible from only two directions , both covered by an easy field of fire from the door and windows . For seven months , Ed worked hard and steadily . He put in the first crop , he built the house , and proved himself a handy man with tools . He repaired the old plow they had bought , cleaned out the spring , and paved and walled it with slabs of stone . If he was lonely for the carefree companions of Santa Fe , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he finally started off to the south , Angie watched him go with an ache in her heart . She did not know whether she loved Ed . The first flush of enthusiasm had passed , and Ed Lowe had proved something less than she had believed . But he had tried , she admitted . And it had not been easy for him . He was an amiable soul , given to whittling and idle talk , all of which he missed in the loneliness of the Apache country . And when he rode away , she had no idea whether she would ever see him again . She never did . Santa Fe was far and away to the north , but the growing village of El Paso was less than a hundred miles to the west , and it was there Ed Lowe rode for supplies and seed . He had several drinkshis first in monthsin one of the saloons . As the liquor warmed his stomach , Ed Lowe looked around agreeably . For a moment , his eyes clouded with worry as he thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not in Ed Lowe to worry for long . He had another drink and leaned on the bar , talking to the bartender . All Ed had ever asked of life was enough to eat , a horse to ride , an occasional drink , and companions to talk with . Not that he had anything important to say . He just liked to talk . Suddenly a chair grated on the floor , and Ed turned . A lean , powerful man with a shock of uncut black hair and a torn , weather-faded shirt stood at bay . Facing him across the table were three hard-faced young men , obviously brothers . Ches Lane did not notice Ed Lowe watching from the bar . He had eyes only for the men facing him . You done that deliberate ! The statement was a challenge . The broad-chested man on the left grinned through broken teeth . That 's right , Ches . I done it deliberate . You killed Dan Tolliver on the Brazos . He made the quarrel . Comprehension came to Ches . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tollivers . Do n't make no difference , the broad-chested Tolliver said . Who sheds a Tolliver 's blood , by a Tolliver 's hand must die ! ' Ed Lowe moved suddenly from the bar . Three to one is long odds , he said , his voice low and friendly . If the gent in the corner is willin ' , I 'll side him . Two Tollivers turned toward him . Ed Lowe was smiling easily , his hand hovering near his gun . You stay out of this ! one of the brothers said harshly . I 'm in , Ed replied . Why do n't you boys light a shuck ? No , by ! The man 's hand dropped for his gun , and the room thundered with sound . Ed was smiling easily , unworried as always . His gun flashed up . He felt it leap in his hand , saw the nearest Tolliver smashed back , and he shot him again as he dropped . He had only time to see Ches Lane with two guns out and another Tolliver down when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the bar , suddenly sick . The sound stopped , and the room was quiet , and there was the acrid smell of powder smoke . Three Tollivers were down and dead , and Ed Lowe was dying . Ches Lane crossed to him . We got ' em , Ed said , we sure did . But they got me . Suddenly his face changed . Oh , Lord in heaven , what 'll Angie do ? And then he crumpled over on the floor and lay still , the blood staining his shirt and mingling with the sawdust . Stiff-faced , Ches looked up . Who was Angie ? he asked . His wife , the bartender told him . She 's up northeast somewhere , in Apache country . He was tellin ' me about her . Two kids , too . Ches Lane stared down at the crumpled , used-up body of Ed Lowe . The man had saved his life . One he could have beaten , two he might have beaten ; three would have killed him . Ed Lowe , stepping in when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't say where ? No . Ches Lane shoved his hat back on his head . What 's northeast of here ? The bartender rested his hands on the bar . Cochise , he said . . . . For more than three months , whenever he could rustle the grub , Ches Lane quartered the country over and back . The trouble was , he had no lead to the location of Ed Lowe 's homestead . An examination of Ed 's horse revealed nothing . Lowe had bought seed and ammunition , and the seed indicated a good water supply , and the ammunition implied trouble . But in that country there was always trouble . A man had died to save his life , and Ches Lane had a deep sense of obligation . Somewhere that wife waited , if she was still alive , and it was up to him to find her and look out for her . He rode northeast , cutting for sign , but found none . Sandstorms had wiped out any hope of back-trailing Lowe . Actually , West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no way of knowing . North he went , skirting the rugged San Andreas Mountains . Heat baked him hot , dry winds parched his skin . His hair grew dry and stiff and alkali-whitened . He rode north , and soon the Apaches knew of him . He fought them at a lonely water hole , and he fought them on the run . They killed his horse , and he switched his saddle to the spare and rode on . They cornered him in the rocks , and he killed two of them and escaped by night . They trailed him through the White Sands , and he left two more for dead . He fought fiercely and bitterly , and would not be turned from his quest . He turned east through the lava beds and still more east to the Pecos . He saw only two white men , and neither knew of a white woman . The bearded man laughed harshly . A woman alone ? She would n't last a month ! By now the Apaches got her , or she 's dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you die here . Lean , wind-whipped , and savage , Ches Lane pushed on . The Mescaleros cornered him in Rawhide Draw and he fought them to a standstill . Grimly , the Apaches clung to his trail . The sheer determination of the man fascinated them . Bred and born in a rugged and lonely land , the Apaches knew the difficulties of survival ; they knew how a man could live , how he must live . Even as they tried to kill this man , they loved him , for he was one of their own . Lane 's jeans grew ragged . Two bullet holes were added to the old black hat . The slicker was torn ; the saddle , so carefully kept until now , was scratched by gravel and brush . At night he cleaned his guns and by day he scouted the trails . Three times he found lonely ranch houses burned to the ground , the buzzard- and coyote-stripped bones of their owners lying nearby . Once he found a covered wagon , its canvas flopping in the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near his hand . He was dead and his wife was dead , and their canteens rattled like empty skulls . Leaner every day , Ches Lane pushed on . He camped one night in a canyon near some white oaks . He heard a hoof click on stone and he backed away from his tiny fire , gun in hand . The riders were white men , and there were two of them . Joe Tompkins and Wiley Lynn were headed west , and Ches Lane could have guessed why . They were men he had known before , and he told them what he was doing . Lynn chuckled . He was a thin-faced man with lank yellow hair and dirty fingers . Seems a mighty strange way to get a woman . There 's some as comes easier . This ai n't for fun , Ches replied shortly . I got to find her .
