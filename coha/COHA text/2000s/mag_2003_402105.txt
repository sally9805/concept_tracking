1 get healthy with family activities Syracuse University researchers found that people who have family routines ( like cleaning up together after meals ) are in better physical health than those who do n't . And people who participate in rituals ( meaningful activities , like Sunday dinner ) have better emotional health than those who forgo them . So turn those big , long hugs you sometimes give your husband and kids at the end of the day into a daily habit , and talk about past family activities you 'd like to repeat . 2 SLIM DOWN BY CUTTING YOUR Think serving sizes look bigger than ever ? You 're not imagining things : Close to 20 years of research at the University of North Carolina found that portion sizes for foods at restaurants and at home have grown significantly . For instance , a cheeseburger bloated from 5.8 to 7.3 ounces , a 136-calorie increase ! To keep portions in check , learn what constitutes a normal serving size . At home , know that a three-ounce serving of meat is about the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what a cup of cereal looks like . When eating out , share an order , or set some aside to take home in a doggie bag . 3 how to live with the choices you make Second-guessing your decisions can suck the joy out of your life . Here 's proof : Swarthmore College researchers compared people 's decision-making personalities : While " maximizers " explore their options exhaustively , others are satisfied with a decision that 's " good enough . " Not surprisingly , maximizers experience less happiness and lower self-esteem than the " good enough " group . How to stop obsessing ? Limit your possible choices in low-stakes situations , says study coauthor Barry Schwartz , Ph.D . For instance , if you 've found a good deal at a reputable hotel , do n't search for more offers . 4 EAT A HANDFUL OF CHOCOLATE FOR YOUR HEART You 've probably heard that chocolate has health benefits ; it contains a substance called flavonol that may protect against stroke and heart attack .

But do n't overdo it : New research shows that people need to eat only 25 grams ( a handful ) of semisweet chocolate morsels to reap the same health benefits as those who consume four times as much .

Researchers at Baskent University in Turkey studied people with abdominal discomfort who tested positive for H. pylori ; bad breath was one of the symptoms the subjects reported most often , along with bloating and chronic pain . After treatment ( with antibiotics plus an acid inhibitor ) , most people got rid of H. pylori-and bad breath . So if your breath problem is n't due to common culprits , such as smoking and sinusitis , ask your doctor to test you for the bug . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
