The Philosopher 's Club <p> Tuesday <p> An unknown male  --  approximately fifty-five years old , with an almost full head of gray hair , a slight build , an even slighter paunch , and a weathered but friendly face , garbed in a snappy suit and a not-unpleasant tie  --  walked into the bar . He sat down at the counter and nodded a silent hello . <p> " What can I get you ? " I said . <p> " Coffee , " Unknown Male replied . <p> " Irish coffee ? " I asked . <p> " Nope . Just the regular stuff . " <p> " You know , they got coffee shops , if you 're into that sort of thing . " <p> " It 's three in the afternoon , " Unknown Male replied . <p> " It 's still a bar , " I responded , and poured a mug of the stale brew . " Cream and sugar ? " I asked . <p> " Black , " he answered . Unknown Male took a sip and grimaced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cream and sugar . " <p> " Thought so . " <p> Unknown Male put a five-dollar bill on the bar and told me to keep the change . I rang two dollars into the cash register and put the remaining three into the tip jar . <p> " You Isabel ? " Unknown Male asked . <p> " Who 's asking ? " I replied . <p> " Ernest Black , " the less-unknown male said , stretching out his hand . " My friends call me Ernie . " <p> I shook it , because that 's what you do , and then picked up a dishrag and began drying some glasses , because that 's what bartenders do . <p> " I heard you used to be a detective , " Ernie said . <p> " Where 'd you hear that ? " <p> " I was in here the other day talking to Milo . " <p> " You and Milo friends ? " I asked . <p> " We 're not enemies . Anyway , Milo said you used to be a detective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dried some more glasses . <p> There was a long pause while Ernie tried to figure out how to keep the conversation going . <p> " It looks like you 're a bartender now , " Ernie said . <p> " So it seems . " <p> " Is this like a career path or more like a rest stop on a longer journey ? " he asked . <p> " Huh ? " I said , even though I understood what Ernie was getting at . <p> " I 'm just wondering , are you planning on doing this bartender thing long-term or do you think you might go back into the PI business somewhere down the line ? " <p> I casually put down the glass and the dishrag . I reached over the bar and grabbed Ernie by the not-unpleasant tie he was wearing and leaned in close enough to smell his stale coffee breath . <p> " Tell my mother that if she wants to know my plans for the future , she should ask me herself ! " <br> <p> Wednesday <p> My dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd been expecting him . Three o'clock on Wednesday is his usual time . He likes an empty bar so he can speak freely . <p> " The usual , " Dad said , mostly because he likes feeling like a regular . Dad 's usual is a five-ounce glass of red wine . He 'd rather order a beer or whiskey or both , but his heart condition and my mother prohibit all of the above . <p> I poured the wine , slid the glass in his direction , leaned on top of the bar , and looked my dad in the eye . <p> " Mom sent some guy into the bar yesterday to pump me for information . " <p> " No , she did n't , " Dad said , looking bored . <p> " Yes , she did , " I replied . <p> " Isabel , she did that one time two months ago and she never did it again . I promise you . " <p> " You have no idea what she 's doing when you 're not watching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dad said . <p> " But I 'm talking about Mom . " <p> " I 'd like to change the subject , Isabel . " <p> I sighed , disappointed . I was not interested in the subject my dad had in mind . <p> " If you 'd like to talk about the weather , I 'd be alright with that . " <p> " Not the weather , " said Dad . <p> " Seen any good movies ? " I asked . <p> " Have n't been getting out much lately , " Dad said , " what with work and all . Oh yes . Work . That 's what I 'd like to talk about . " <p> " I do n't want to talk about work . " <p> " You do n't talk . You just listen . Can you do that ? " <p> " I distinctly recall you telling me that I was n't a good listener , " I replied . " So , apparently I can not do that . " <p> " Isabel ! " Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty bar ? " We are having this conversation whether you like it or not . " <p> In case you were thinking the definition had changed , a conversation usually involves two people exchanging words , a back-and-forth , if you will . My dad provided a brief lecture that went something like this : <p> " You are a licensed private investigator . That is your trade . And yet , for the last five months , all you have done is serve drinks and collect tips . You have refused to work at a job for which you are highly qualified , which used to give you some real purpose in life . I spent seven long , hard years training you at that job , teaching you everything I know while you talked back , nodded off , screwed up , broke equipment , slammed my hand in a car door , lost me clients , and cost me a fortune in car insurance . Seven long years , Isabel . I ca n't get those years back . They 're lost to me forever . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have hired a nice responsible college student looking for a little excitement in his or her life ? Someone who did n't insult my intelligence on a daily basis or leave cigarette butts and empty beer cans in the surveillance van , someone who said ' Yes , Mr. Spellman ' instead of rolling her eyes and grunting ? Can you imagine how my life might be different ? How my health might be improved ? Five months ago , when you took this ' temporary ' job , you promised your mother and me that you would start actively thinking about your future , which is directly connected to our future , because it 's connected to the future of this business we have built not just for us , but for you . So , tell me , Isabel , after five months of serving drinks and over two months of seeing a shrink , are you any closer to making that decision ? " <p> I 'm not usually one who follows the adage " Honesty is the best policy , " but my dad 's speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the very short truth . <p> " Nope , " I said . <p> Dad sucked the last drop of alcohol out of his wineglass . He searched the empty bar as if he were looking for assistance . He made brief eye contact , but he could n't hold it . The disappointment was evident . Even I felt some sympathy . <p> " Sounds like you could use a real drink , Dad , " I said as I poured him a shot of Maker 's Mark . " This will be our little secret . " <br> <p> Friday <p> A middle-age man walked into the bar followed by a teenage girl . The man appeared angry , the teenager defiant . Meet my sister , Rae , and her " best friend , " Henry Stone . <p> Three bar stools divided them . Henry unrolled the New Yorker magazine he was carrying under his arm and began reading . Rae dusted off the already-dusted-off counter and said , " The usual . " Her usual is a ginger ale followed by a reminder that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's only sixteen ( and a half ! ) years old . I poured Rae 's ginger ale and served Henry his usual club soda . I waited for the unusual stretch of silence to end . Rae watched Henry out of the corner of her eye . He studied his magazine with rapt attention , uninterested in  --  or at least pretending quite well to be uninterested in  --  the rest of the room . As an act of what appeared to be mimicry , Rae pulled out her geometry textbook and gave a performance of rapt attention . Hers failed where Henry 's succeeded . She checked him out of the corner of her eye , waiting for some acknowledgment of her presence . Rae downed her ginger ale and smacked the glass on the counter , making her presence impossible to ignore . <p> " I 'll have another , " she said . <p> " Does somebody want to tell me what 's going on ? " I asked as I served her second round . <p> " Nothing . Henry just needs to chillax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to that ? " I asked Henry . <p> " Isabel , " he said , " this is a bar . Not a soda shop . Adults come here to get away from children . I could have you shut down for serving minors . " <p> " Rae , go home , " I said , sensing that Henry needed some space . <p> " I do n't think so , " was Rae 's response . <p> " I tried , " I said , turning back to Henry . <p> Henry finished his club soda and asked for something stronger . I suggested 7UP , but he had bourbon in mind , which meant my sister had done something terribly wrong . I was intrigued . <p> " What did you do ? " I asked Rae after I served Henry his Bulleit . <p> " Tell Henry , " Rae said , " that what I did , I did for his own good . " <p> " Did you hear that ? " I said to Henry . <p> He looked up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Um , Rae said that what she did , she did for your own good . " <p> " Well , you can tell your sister that it was not her decision to make . " <p> " What did he say ? " Rae asked , even though Henry 's response was perfectly audible . <p> " You 're kidding me , right ? " I asked . <p> " What did he say ? " she insisted . <p> " He said it was not your decision to make . " <p> " Tell him he 'll thank me later . " <p> Henry returned to his magazine and continued pretending that Rae existed in some parallel universe where only I could see and hear her . I decided to play along for the time being , since I had to admit I wanted the scoop . <p> " She said you 'll thank her later . " <p> " Tell her I wo n't . Tell her she 's forbidden to come to my house ever again . " <p> " You ca n't be serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer required , because this was directed at Henry 's back . <p> " Oh , I 'm very serious , " he replied , finishing off the last of his bourbon . I was shocked when he pointed to his glass and asked for another , but I assumed this meant further information would be forthcoming , so I served the drink and eagerly awaited the rest of the story.Copyright 2009 by Spellman Enterprises , Inc . <br> Continues ...
