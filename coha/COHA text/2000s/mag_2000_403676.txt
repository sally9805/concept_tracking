/Jan 2000 It 's snowing hard for the third day in a row and you 've exhausted your supply of video games , board games and movies . You and the kids have a bad case of cabin fever . But do n't worry . The cure is at hand  --  as close as your own kitchen or linen cupboard . Busy babies Kitchen music : Break with tradition and encourage your baby to bang a spoon on all the metal mixing bowls and pots he can find . Make some shakers with empty tin cans or yogurt containers , rice or beans and taped-on lids . Loop elastic bands across an empty Kleenex box for a guitar . Tape or glue two paper plates together with beans inside , attach a green construction paper or cloth head , tail , arms and legs and you 've got a turtle shaker . Obstacle course : If your baby is crawling , she 'll enjoy a maze made from rolled-up towels , cardboard-box tunnels ( cut the box ends off ) and big cushions . Bowl-a-rama : Babies love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowling game with a rubber ball and yogurt containers stacked in a pyramid . Or rinse out empty milk cartons , tape them shut and use them as bowling pins . All about me : Make a book about your baby by filling a small photo album with pictures of her and her parents , siblings , cousins , pets  --  whoever . You can also insert drawings and other art done by your baby 's siblings showing her daily activities . Use one with plastic see-through pages so that you can wipe off the marks from sticky fingers after repeated readings . For the birds : Hang scooped-out orange or grapefruit halves filled with birdseed on branches close to the window . Or hang pine cones smeared with equal parts peanut butter and birdseed . Baby can watch for winter birds to appear . Think inside the box : A large cardboard appliance box will provide hours of fun if you turn it into a house with doors and windows . Totally toddler Sift and sand : Fill a large plastic bin with puffed rice cereal and hide some small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy finding the hidden treasures while scooping out the puffed rice and eating it . If your kids are past the everything-in-the-mouth stage , you can also use a big bag of rice or several bags of cornmeal as makeshift sand , with some yogurt containers or small shovels for digging . All aboard : Save cardboard boxes ( the kind that have no flaps ) from the grocery store and make train cars by stringing them together . Or upend some dining-room or kitchen chairs so that the backs are lying flat on the floor and the " engineer " can sit to drive the train with his back against the chair seat . Blow a whistle for the train to start up . You can also play train while sitting in empty laundry baskets . Which way to the beach ? Pretend it 's July by turning up the heat , resurrecting the inflatable wading pool or the baby bath and creating a beach on the kitchen floor or in the basement . Cover the floor with a plastic tablecloth or tarp . Make sandwiches and have a picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let your kids pretend they are animals at the zoo by housing them under a few armchairs . My children used to love being fed treats through the bars of their " cages " and would roar for more . Their stuffed animals can join them when it 's time for a nap . Me and my shadow : Take a piece of brown kraft paper as long as your child ( or tape paper grocery bags together ) and have her lie down on it . Trace around her arms , legs and head and then get her to stand up . Help her draw on whatever she is wearing that day with markers , attach yarn hair and button eyes and nose , and hang it up or let her play with her new " playmate . " Preschoolers " pleasure Jaws : When my kids were little , they used to play shark : They 'd make a giant " sea " by putting all the sofa cushions on the floor . One of them , the " shark , " would wriggle along the sofa cushions trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " shore " ( the sofa ) but the shark had to stay in the sea . Or simply take the couch apart and build an elaborate fort out of the cushions . On the road again : If you have an unfinished basement , get out the tricycles and set up a road rally . Attach masking tape to the floor to mark lanes and a parking lot , make a stop sign out of cardboard and let the kids take turns playing traffic cop . Or try what my friend Lesja used to do . Take the tricycles or in-line skates to the mall before the stores open . The kids can race up and down the huge expanse of floor without bothering anyone . ( Check with the malls in your area to confirm that this will work . ) Have a ball : Bring in some snow from the backyard , make it into balls and freeze them . The frozen snowballs can be painted with tempera paints and then put back into the freezer to come out again in sweltering July . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colouring and let your child paint the snow . Acting troupe : This one is great for tired moms and dads . Lie on the couch with a storybook such as The Three Little Pigs or Cinderella  --  one with lots of action . Let the kids choose their parts and act out the story as you read it . Pause between sentences to let them practise their lines and gestures . Even nursery rhymes such as Wee Willie Winkie are fun to stage . Art attack : Turn your home into a fine-art museum . Pin up your child 's signed paintings , drawings , collages , even photos , place clay sculptures on coffee-can pedestals and invite family , friends or neighbours to a vernissage ( art opening ) . Serve grape juice and cheese and let your kids talk about their work . We did this once and guests actually bought paintings ( for 50 cents or a dollar ) after our three-year-old explained their meanings . Puppet theatre : Place an expandable curtain rod in a doorway at kid level , hang a tablecloth or thread a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant puppet theatre . If you do n't have real hand puppets , you can use stuffed animals or make some puppets out of odd socks with buttons for eyes and yarn for hair . All the rage with school age Arctic village : Use sugar cubes and a mortar of 2 egg whites and a pinch of cream of tartar mixed with 3 cups icing sugar to build an Arctic village of igloos and ice buildings . Use food colouring and a small brush to tint some of the structures if you like . Ask your child to hunt out cold-weather toy animals such as polar bears , seals or penguins to complete the scene . Marshmallow geometry : The kids will be busy for ages with a bag of miniature marshmallows and a box of toothpicks . They can build spaceships and rockets , houses or skyscrapers . If you 're worried about the sugar content , use small pieces of potato or raw cranberries instead . Around the world : Spin a globe or get out an atlas and have your kids point , with their eyes shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be living in that country for a day . Parents may have to do a little research along with the kids : You can cook a meal with foods or spices from that country , take books out of the library that are set there or even learn a word or two in a foreign language . Ice candles : Fill large water balloons ( available at most toy stores ) with water , tie them and place them outside on a paper plate to freeze ( or use your freezer ) . When frozen ( it takes a few days ) , peel away the balloons . Run a stream of hot water over the top of each globe to create a hole halfway down the middle . Upend the ice lanterns over votive candles . Let them light a path or flicker away outside a window like a lantern lighting up the night . Lucky pennies . Turn some old dirty pennies into " pirate gold " by immersing them in a vinegar and salt solution : Mix 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 1 teaspoon of salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coins for 5 to 10 minutes and put on your sunglasses . The preteen scene Cut the wrap ' Make your own wrapping for presents with kraft paper and potato shapes dipped into tempera paint . Or save the lids from yogurt and coffee containers to make stencils . Cut out star or animal shapes and then hold down while painting the shape onto the paper . Flippin ' good fun : Invite your junior chefs to create their own fun pancakes . Spoon three blobs of batter for snowmen , add chocolate chips for eyes and mouth , and whipped cream " snow . " Or pour batter into an empty plastic bottle and squeeze giant initials in the pancake pan , one for every person in the family . DJ for a day : A tape recorder and a blank tape can provide hours of fun . My three used to make silly recordings during long car rides but you can do this anywhere . One kid can be the station manager , one the weatherman , one chooses the music ( if you have a double tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of the day , and so on . Pass the story : Sit everyone down together and have each " player " use Plasticine or playdough to create an animal or a character . Toothpicks and yarn can make manes , whiskers , hair or a tail . Then work together to create a story about the characters : Each person writes a few sentences of action on a piece of paper , folds over the paper so that his part of the story is n't visible and passes it to the next person . After everyone has written a chunk of story , someone is chosen to read the whole thing out loud while the other players have the characters act out their parts . The results are often hilarious . Household bingo : If your place is a mess , here 's a good way to get it cleaned in a jiff . Mark the top of pieces of cardboard ( one for each child ) with BINGO letters , then fill in the squares with chores such as " Put away five objects " or " Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun squares , like " Come to the kitchen for a snack and a drink .
