It was just a Tuesday . Steven 's key worked like it always had . His mother was lying between the living room and the front hall . He saw her feet first . They were bare , and at first he thought she was doing her yoga . She was on her side . Her bottom leg was straight . Her top one was bent . One arm was stretched above her . Her head was resting on it . Her other arm was bent across her middle . Her hand was in a fist . Her dress was up around her waist . Her panties were ripped . He could see her blue birthmark below her belly button . There were scratches on her thighs . There was a lot of blood . The green rug from the hall was bunched underneath her hip and bloody . The phone was on its side next to her . It was bloody . The windows were open . Down there on the corner of 102nd and West End , Ramon and Jimmy were sitting on their overturned crates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hear them . The fans were on . She smelled wrong . The TV was on . The sound was off . He stood there . He 'd been up high on a catwalk for the spring musical . It felt like that now . His body was shaking as if he were freezing , but sweat beaded under his bangs and between his shoulder blades . Kitty came fromsomewhere down the hall and circled his legs . He tried to pet her , but could n't stop the trembling . Manuel 's voice came up through the windows . " Not in a minute , " he was saying . " Now . Before now . Yesterday . " He walked by her , closing his eyes , to the TV . A nature show . He turned it off and watched the screen until the dot in the center disappeared . The shaking was going away . He was still cold . They 'd had this TV for a hundred years . When Starsky and Hutch walked toward him they looked like people in a dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better one . Hot air blew around him from outside . He felt like the guy on Wild Kingdom getting licked by cheetah cubs . He sat cross-legged across the room from her for a minute . Kitty leaned against his knee , making her small engine sounds deep in her throat . He could n't tell where she 'd been stabbed . He was sleepy . He 'd spent the day in the park , climbing rocks and breaking sticks with Juan . They 'd eaten peanut-butter-and-honey sandwiches and shared a Yoo-hoo . There 'd been a dead pigeon in the sandbox . " Do n't touch it , " Juan had said . " You 'll get rabbis . " His mother was Greek ; sometimes she got words wrong . They 'd poked at it with a stick , and then they 'd washed their hands anyway , proud of their good thinking . He had used the water fountain . Juan had used the puddle around the sprinklers . He was n't thinking the things he was supposed to be thinking . He 'd only been home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling . None of this was happening . Outside , it was getting darker . Inside too . He was crying . Her black hair was still in its ponytail . It was spread out like she was jumping . She was making a face that he did n't like to look at . He thought about touching her , but did n't . Down the hall , a quiet thud and two creaks . His feet and hands tingled . Get out , he thought . He stood ; his knees cracked , and he headed toward the front door . The sound of something heavy being lifted and put down again . He was still crying . He started down the hall . He could n't believe he was doing it . There was blood . Streaky patches of it . And then it stopped . His foot hit something that rolled . Glass beads . He recognized them from the necklace she liked to wear . Her bedroom door was open a little . Shadows moved behind it . He ran the last few feet . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " Hey , " he called . " Hey . " One leg was disappearing out the window onto the fire escape . Jeans . A white sock . Adidas sneaker . White with green stripes . The room was a mess , but there was no blood . " Hey , " he said again . " You , " he called , hating himself for being stupid and twelve and sounding like a girl . He stuck his head out as far as he could . His mother did n't like him to . He saw someone running . A man in a white T-shirt . It was too dark to see anything else . He could n't even tell what color hair the guy had . The bed looked like someone had made it and then run back and forth across it . Everything else looked the same . He felt like he was looking at things through a ViewMaster . His stomach was cramping . His head felt cut in half . He went and stood in her closet . When he was little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He would sit on the floor on top of her shoes and handbags and dirty clothes . He was supposed to be able to spend the whole night in his own room . His doctor had told her that . If she had to , he 'd told her , she could always put a latch on the outside of the boy 's bedroom door . " What 's the worst that could happen ? " he 'd said . " He 'll fall asleep crying by the door . " She never did . So he 'd fall asleep in her closet , and she 'd find him in the morning . One night he opened the door and there was a sleeping bag and pillow . The sleeping bag was unzipped partway and turned down . After that , he did n't go in there anymore . The closet smelled like dust and blankets and sweaters and her . Sometimes when she 'd had a long day , she 'd stay in the shower , standing under the hot water for way longer than it took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just the best place to be . Under the water , by herself . Continues ...
