<p> Tonight before a sold-out crowd of 1,000-plus at the Waverly Hotel , Larry Munson will be honored for his 40 years as voice of the Georgia Bulldogs . To set the mood , a number of Munson 's friends and fans shared their favorite memories with staff writer Tony Barnhart . <p> By VERNE LUNDQUIST <p> In 2002 , we were at Auburn when David Greene threw the pass to Michael Johnson to win the game and put Georgia in the SEC championship . As soon as I made the call , I thought : " I wonder what Larry Munson said ? " <p> Sure enough , we soon had Larry 's call of the play , and of course , it was just priceless . <p> I ca n't think of anyone else who is associated with his school more closely than Larry is with Georgia . He makes no bones about the fact that he is pulling for Georgia . He sees the game through a passionate fan 's eye . <p> When I 'm in the car on a Saturday night driving back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to Larry if Georgia is playing a night game . I just love his distinctive style . <p> Larry is a treasure who all of us can enjoy . <p> Lundquist has called the SEC Game of the Week on CBS since 2001 . <p> By KEITH JACKSON <p> It 's amazing how much energy and adrenaline Larry still spends during a broadcast . And after 40 seasons , he is ready to go with the next sun-up . But then it 's only 40 . He 's still limber and chasing those two ol ' boys from that neck of the woods  --  Jackson and Ernie Harwell . <p> Keep it going , Larry . You 'll never have more fun ! <p> Jackson , a native of Roopville , retired from ABC after January 's national championship game . He lives in Sherman Oaks , Calif . <p> By RICK FRANZMAN <p> From " Run , Lindsay , Run " to " Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! " to " Sugar Falling Out of the Sky , " Larry has been the most visible instrument connecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible 40 years . <p> There are a lot of long-term , beloved figures who have taken on institutional status . But Larry is an icon , not because of the joy , but because of the pain . Larry 's anguish in defeat pours through the microphone and connects the Bulldog Nation to an emotion we all feel at once . <p> At the Georgia-Florida game in 1974 , I sat two booths over from Larry . Glynn Harrison danced three-fourths of the length of the field for an apparent go-ahead touchdown and the ensuing celebration literally moved the Gator Bowl . <p> Then came the flag . The play was nullified . I looked to Larry and he was physically retching . I could see him cursing that horrible yellow flag with the same pain that 35,000 Dog fans in the stands felt at that very moment . <p> Every Bulldog knows that sometimes , with so much invested in the cause , there will be those moments that devastate us . And every Dawg knows that Larry , who is pure-bred Bulldog , suffers them with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the UGA student newspaper , in 1974 . He lives in Marietta . <p> By BRAD NESSLER <p> I still think Larry 's " Sugar Falling Out of the Sky " at Auburn in 1982 may be the best single line ever by a football announcer . To me , it 's the " Do You Believe in Miracles ? " of radio calls . <p> When I moved to Atlanta 26 years ago , I really did n't know what to make of Larry . I 'd never really heard someone use " us " and " them " on an every-play basis . But that 's what makes " Muns " special , and that 's why Dog fans love him so much . <p> I do n't get the chance to hear him as much as I 'd like to , because we sort of run on the same schedule . But when I have an early afternoon game and the Dogs play at night , the first thing I do when I get back home is turn on Munson . There is nothing more enjoyable on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the heck a hob-nailed boot is . <p> Nessler , the former voice of the Atlanta Falcons , now calls college football for ABC . <p> By MATT STINCHCOMB <p> I will never , ever forget the " hobnail boot " call against Tennessee in 2001 . It was the end of a brutal and oppressive drought of losses vs. our neighbors to the north . I can remember the play in my mind 's eye with his voice as the narrative sound track . <p> Larry has withstood the test of time because he is a throwback as a story teller . Somehow he can capture the emotion of the moment and articulate the sentiments of those there at the game and sometimes even those playing in the game . <p> What better way to describe that victory over Tennessee than with those words ? It is perfect to me and I do n't even know what a hob-nailed boot is ! <p> Stinchcomb was an academic and football All-American at Georgia . <p> By DIANE BLOODWORTH <p> As a naive young woman from rural Georgia , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I quickly learned some of the very important lessons about life at Georgia  --  the importance of Bulldog football and that the voice of the Dawgs was Larry Munson . <p> When I hear his voice even now , it takes me back to warm , fall afternoons and hanging " Go Dawgs " sheets out of Brumby Hall as we got ready to cheer the team . <p> When I think of Larry , it is much more than just one game . It is his lifetime of enthusiasm for the Bulldogs and his distinctive voice . He is truly the voice that everyone associates with our beloved team . <p> Diane Bloodworth ( Georgia ' 82 ) is president of PerceptivePro , which recently developed a scouting and game planning system for college and pro football . <p> By MATT ROBINSON <p> My favorite moment with Larry , believe it or not , came in 2004 when he was inducted in the Georgia-Florida Hall of Fame here in Jacksonville . I was able to sit next to him on the dais for the entire banquet . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of Georgia football history because Larry Munson spoke my name during a three-year run that resulted in the origination of the Junkyard Dawgs , shaved heads , three bowl games , an SEC championship , a national championship game and a coaching staff that ended the 1976 season minus some hair . Embedded in his voice are the accomplishments of those teams  --  and all Georgia teams since 1966  --  in the minds of Georgia fans forever . <p> Most people only get to read about history in books . I was able to talk to history and relive some very special moments . It had quite an effect on me . <p> Former UGA quarterback Matt Robinson , who went on to play 10 years of pro football , lives in Jacksonville . <p> By BUCK BELUE <p> My first recollection of Larry Munson is when I was 10 or 11 and my dad took me to the homecoming parade at Georgia . My grandmother lived in Athens and her apartment was right on Milledge Avenue , where the parade would come past . <p> Larry was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Budweiser in the other . Back then , there was a fad called " streaking " going on . Suddenly here came a streaker , a female , and Larry had the best view of anybody . That is the first time I can remember seeing Larry Munson . <p> As a youngster and as a player at Georgia , you really ca n't appreciate what the broadcaster is doing . But now that I am in the business myself , I know how much of himself Larry brings to his work . I really get offended sometimes when people outside the area call him a " homer " and criticize him . They do n't understand what Larry Munson is all about , and they never will . <p> I 'm lucky because his voice called what many believe is one of the top 10 plays in college football history ( Belue to Lindsay Scott vs . Florida , 1980 ) , and I had a chance to be a part of it . I 'm just glad Larry remembered my name and did n't say : " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it better . <p> The Georgia people love Larry because they can hear him pouring out his heart and soul on every play . That is what they appreciate most . He is fighting just like the players . <p> Belue quarterbacked Georgia 's 1980 national championship team . He hosts a daily radio show " Buck and Kincade " on 680 The Fan . <p> By WES DURHAM <p> Whether or not I had come to Georgia Tech , Larry and I would have still become friends , in part because we had both broadcast Vanderbilt football and basketball games . In Nashville , he could smoke his favorite cigars during the game or on his television sportscast . Now those are reserved for good fishing or Bulldog football . <p> His wisdom on his profession has helped me a couple of different times in my career . One was moving to Atlanta and working for the Jackets . The second was a couple of years ago when I added the Falcons to my duties . Munson will still claim I have it a lot easier than he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . He 's right of course . After all , he was traveling from Starkville to Los Angeles . <p> My respect and admiration for Larry is also for his tenure in this business and his loyalty to the University of Georgia . Men like Larry , my dad North Carolina 's Woody Durham , John Ward Tennessee , the late Cawood Ledford Kentucky and Al Ciraldo Georgia Tech are inspirational to today 's play-by-play announcer . <p> Players , coaches and administrators come and go , but we are in the final stages of some great college radio announcers in sports . <p> Cheers to Larry , and here 's to 40 more with the Dawgs . <p> Wes Durham is the voice of Georgia Tech football and the Falcons .
