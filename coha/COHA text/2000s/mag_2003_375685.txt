The gorgeous female cryptographer and the hunky college professor are fleeing the scene of a ghastly murder they did not commit . In the midst of their escape , which will eventually utilize an armored car , a private jet , electronic-surveillance devices and just enough unavoidable violence to keep things interesting , our heroes seek out the one man who holds the key not only to their exoneration but also to a mystery that could change the world . To help explain it to them , crippled , jovial , fabulously wealthy historian Sir Leigh Teabing points out a figure in a famous painting . <P> " ' Who is she ? ' Sophie asked . <P> " ' That , my dear , ' Teabing replied , ' is Mary Magdalene . ' <P> " Sophie turned . ' The prostitute ? ' <P> " Teabing drew a short breath , as if the word had injured him personally . ' Magdalene was no such thing . That unfortunate misconception is the legacy of a smear campaign launched by the early Church . ' " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6th century church history . Perhaps that is their loss . The Da Vinci Code , by Dan Brown , now in its 18th week on the New York Times hard-cover fiction best-seller list , is one of those hypercaffeinated conspiracy specials with two-page chapters and people 's hair described as " burgundy . " But Brown , who by book 's end has woven Magdalene intricately and rather outrageously into his plot , has picked his MacGuffin cannily . Not only has he enlisted one of the few New Testament personages whom a reader might arguably imagine in a bathing suit ( generations of Old Masters , after all , painted her topless ) . He has chosen a character whose actual identity is in play , both in theology and pop culture . <P> Three decades ago , the Roman Catholic Church quietly admitted what critics had been saying for centuries : Magdalene 's standard image as a reformed prostitute is not supported by the text of the Bible . Freed of this lurid , limiting premise and employing varying ratios of scholarship and whimsy , academics and enthusiasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron of Jesus , an Apostle in her own right , the mother of the Messiah 's child and even his prophetic successor . The wealth of possibilities has inspired a wave of literature , both academic and popular , including Margaret George 's 2002 best-selling historical novel Mary , Called Magdalene . And it has gained Magdalene a new following among Catholics who see in her a potent female role model and a possible argument against the all-male priesthood . The woman who three Gospels agree was the first witness to Christ 's Resurrection is having her own kind of rebirth . Says Ellen Turner , who played host to an alternative celebration for the saint on her traditional feast day on July 22 : " Mary Magdalene got worked over by the church , but she is still there for us . If we can bring her story forward , we can get back to what Jesus was really about . "
