A World of Misplaced Worry <P> We fear massive terrorism plots , killer strains of bacteria in our food and lurking predators , but we seldom think of heart disease when we order fries . Thrill-seeking readers appreciated our analysis of the threats we face every day , which  --  surprise !  --  do n't include a bungee jump or deadly snakes <P> Thanks for taking the time to point out what too often gets lost in today 's climate of paranoia : people worry about the wrong things Dec. 4 . I race motorcycles , so I often hear ill-informed proclamations about the danger I face . I contend that fast food and tobacco are much more likely to kill you than riding is . My father always said , " You can do safe things dangerously and dangerous things safely , " and when you consider that nearly half of fatalities from motorcycle accidents involve alcohol , my odds improve . Add a helmet and other protective gear , and my odds are better still . But nothing can protect you from an unhealthful lifestyle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be broadcast instantly around the planet , it 's easy to believe that we live in a particularly dangerous era . But I do n't buy it . I stopped watching television , so I am not bothered by shampoo bombs on airplanes or strange bacteria in my spinach . The information age has lengthened the list of things to worry about . It seems the biggest worriers accept the evening news as absolute truth . MICHELLE SISSON Fair Oaks , Calif . <P> Jeffrey Kluger 's piece was very interesting , telling and informative . But we should be careful to consider ratios of risk rather than absolute numbers . It may be true that airline travel is safer than car travel , but a fair comparison would be the number of deaths in relation to the number of people traveling in that mode . Obviously , the number of people riding in cars is overwhelmingly higher than the number who fly , so a straight number-of-deaths comparison is slightly misleading . KEVIN CRYDERMAN Rochester , N.Y . <P> Mad Cow Disease , bad spinach and terrorists do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased civility in U.S. culture . My car has become a target for other drivers on the road , just as my body has become a target for other people during the walk to the office . GREGORY A. RETTER Indianapolis , Ind . <P> Death by terrorism was hardly mentioned in TIME 's discussion of causes of death . Clearly we need a well-funded war on heart disease and cancer far more than a war on terrorism . RICHARD WINCHELL Aurora , Ill . <P> At 88 years old , I have learned in my long marriage and even longer life that worrying is an exercise in futility and does not change a thing . I have n't worried since the Nazis arrested me in 1938 and shipped me off to a concentration camp . I had worried the night before . Afterward I decided that worrying is a waste of time and no help whatsoever . What will be will be . CHRIS A. BLUNT Sarasota , Fla.
