Hattie Big Sky By Kirby Larson Random House Kirby Larson December 19 , 1917 Arlington , Iowa Dear Charlie , Miss Simpson starts every day with a reminder to pray for you -- and all the other boys who enlisted . Well , I say we should pray for the Kaiser -- he 's going to need those prayers once he meets you ! I ran into your mother today at Uncle Holt 's store . She said word is you are heading for England soon , France after that . I wo n't hardly be able to look at the map behind Miss Simpson 's desk now ; it will only remind me of how far you are from Arlington . Mr. Whiskers says to tell you he 's doing fine . It 's been so cold , I 've been letting him sleep in my bedroom . If Aunt Ivy knew , she 'd pitch a fit . Thank goodness she finally decided I was too big to switch or my legs would be striped for certain . You should see Aunt Ivy . She 's made herself a cunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitched on the edge . She wears it to all the Red Cross meetings . Guess she wants to make sure everybody knows she 's a paid-up member . She 's been acting odd lately ; even asked me this morning how was I feeling . First time in years she 's inquired about my health . Peculiar . Maybe this Red Cross work has softened her heart . Mildred Powell 's knitting her fifth pair of socks ; they 're not all for you , so do n't get swell-headed . She 's knitting them for the Red Cross . All thegirls at school are . But I suspect the nicest pair she knits will be for you . You must cut quite the figure in your uniform . A figure eight ! ( Ha , ha . ) Seriously , I am certain you are going to make us all proud . Aunt Ivy 's home from her meeting and calling for me . I 'll sign off now but will write again soon . Your school friend , Hattie Inez Brooks I blotted the letter and slipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about reading anything she found lying around , even if it was in my own room , on my own desk . " Hattie , " Aunt Ivy called again . " Come down here ! " To be on the safe side , I slipped the envelope under my pillow , still damp from my good cry last night . Not that I was like Mildred Powell , who had n't stopped boo-hooing since Charlie left . Only Mr. Whiskers and my pillow knew about my tears in the dark over Charlie . I did fret over his safety , but it was pure and sinful selfishness that wet my eyes at night . In all my sixteen years , Charlie Hawley was one of the nicest things to happen to me . It was him who 'd stuck up for me when I first came to live with Aunt Ivy and Uncle Holt , so shy I could n't get my own name out . He 'd walked me to school that very first day and every day after . Charlie was the one who 'd brought me Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . The one who 'd taught me how to pitch , and me a southpaw . So maybe I did spend a night now and then dreaming silly girl dreams about him , even though everyone knew he was sweet on Mildred . My bounce-around life had taught me that dreams were dangerous things -- they look solid in your mind , but you just try to reach for them . It 's like gathering clouds . The class had voted to see Charlie off at the station . Mildred clung to his arm . His father clapped him on the back so often , I was certain he 'd end up bruised . Miss Simpson made a dull speech as she presented Charlie with a gift from the school : a wool stocking cap and some stationery . " Time to get aboard , son , " the conductor called . Something shifted in my heart as Charlie swung his foot up onto the train steps . I had told myself to hang back -- did n't want to be lumped in with someone like Mildred -- but I found myself running up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck ! " I said . He glanced at the object and smiled . With a final wave , he boarded the train . " Oh , Charlie ! " Mildred leaned on Mrs. Hawley and sobbed . " There , there . " Charlie 's mother patted Mildred 's back . Mr. Hawley took a bandanna from his pocket and made a big show of wiping his forehead . I pretended not to notice that he dabbed at his eyes , too . The others made their way slowly down the platform , back to their cars . I stood watching the train a bit longer , picturing Charlie patting the pocket where he 'd placed the wishing stone I 'd given him . He was the one who 'd taught me about those , too . " Look for the black ones , " he 'd told me . " With the white ring around the middle . If you throw them over your left shoulder and make a wish , it 's sure to come true . " He threw his wishing rocks with abandon and laughed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the kind that could be granted by wishing rocks . And now two months had passed since Charlie stepped on that train . With him gone , life was like a batch of biscuits without the baking powder : flat , flat , flat . " Hattie ! " Aunt Ivy 's voice was a warning . " Yes , ma'am ! " I scurried down the stairs . She was holding court in her brown leather chair . Uncle Holt was settled into the hickory rocker , a stack of news- papers on his lap . I slipped into the parlor and picked up my project , a pathetic pair of socks I 'd started back in October when Charlie enlisted . If the war lasted five more years , they might actually get finished . I held them up , peering through a filigree of dropped stitches . Not even a good chum like Charlie could be expected to wear these . " I had a lovely visit with Iantha Wells today . " Aunt Ivy unpinned her Red Cross hat . " You remember Iantha , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Holt shook the newspaper into shape . " I told her what a fine help you were around here , Hattie . " I dropped another stitch . To hear her tell it most days , there was no end to my flaws in the domesticity department . " I myself never finished high school . Not any sense in it for some girls . " Uncle Holt lowered one corner of the paper . I dropped another stitch . Something was up . " No sense at all . Not when there 's folks like Iantha Wells needing help at her boardinghouse . " There . It was out . Now I knew why she had been so kind to me lately . She 'd found a way to get rid of me.
