Chapter One The tall , glass-fronted clock in the corner ticked slowly , endlessly , its swinging pendulum measuring off the seconds and minutes in old-fashioned mechanical bites , and Lord William Alexander , Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Manticoran government 's second ranking member , watched its mesmerizing motion . A modern chrono glowed silently and far more precisely on the desk at his elbow-the clock face was actually divided into the twelve standard hour increments of Old Earth 's day , not Manticore 's twenty-three-plus-hour day-and he wondered , not for the first time , why the man whose office this was surrounded himself with antiques . Lord knew he could afford them , but why was he so fascinated by them ? Could it be because he longed for a simpler , less complicated time ? Alexander hid a small , sad smile at the thought and glanced at the man behind the desk . Allen Summervale , Duke of Cromarty and Prime Minister of the Star Kingdom of Manticore , was a slender man whose fair hair had turned silver long since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had bleached his hair or cut those deep , weary lines in his face ; it was the crushing responsibilities of his job , and who could blame him if he hungered for a world less complex and thankless than his own ? It was a familiar thought , and a frightening one , for if anything ever happened to Cromarty , the burdens of his office would fall upon Alexander 's shoulders . He could conceive of nothing more terrifying ... nor understand what in his own character had driven him to place himself in such a position . Which was only fair , for he could n't even imagine what had compelled Cromarty to shoulder the office of prime minister for over fifteen years . " He did n't say anything about his reasons ? " Alexander asked finally , breaking the ticking silence that gnawed at his nerves . " No . " Cromarty 's voice was a deep , whiskey-smooth baritone , a potent and flexible political weapon , but it was frayed by worry now . " No , " he repeated wearily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal meeting rather than a com conference , I know it has to be something I 'm not going to like . " He smiled crookedly , and Alexander nodded . Michael Janvier , Baron High Ridge , was not high on either man 's list of favorite people . He was cold , supercilious , and filled with a bigot 's awareness of his own " lofty " birth . The fact that both Alexander and Cromarty were far more nobly born than he seemed beside the point to him , a mere bagatelle , something to be resented , perhaps , but not something a Baron of High Ridge need concern himself with . That was typical of the man , Alexander thought sourly . Alexander seldom considered his own birth-except , perhaps , to wish from time to time that he 'd been born to a less prominent and powerful family , free to ignore the tradition of public service his father and grandfather had bred into his blood and bone-but it was the core of High Ridge 's existence . It was all that really mattered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow-minded defense of privilege lay at the heart of his political philosophy , such as it was . Indeed , it was the rallying point of the entire Conservative Association , which explained why it had virtually no representation in the House of Commons , and it went far to explain the Association 's xenophobic isolationism . After all , anything that might cause stress and change in the Manticoran political system was one more dangerous force to conspire against their exalted lot ! Alexander 's mouth twisted , and he slid further down in his chair , reminding himself not to curse in the Prime Minister 's office . And , he thought , to strangle his own dislike when High Ridge finally turned up . If only they did n't need him and his reactionaries ! Their own Centrist Party held a clear sixty-vote majority in the Commons , but only a plurality in the Upper House . With the alliance of the Crown Loyalists and the Association , the Cromarty Government could poll a narrow majority in the Lords ; without the Association , that majority disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and loathsome as he might be , critically important . Especially now . The com unit on Cromarty 's desk hummed for attention , and the duke leaned forward to key it . " Yes , Geoffrey ? " " Baron High Ridge is here , Your Grace . " " Ah . Send him in , please . We 've been expecting him . " He released the key and grimaced at Alexander . " Expecting him for the past twenty minutes , in fact . Why in hell can he never be on time ? " " You know why , " Alexander replied with a sour expression . " He wants to be sure you realize how important he is . " Cromarty snorted bitterly , and then the two of them stood , banishing their honest expressions with false smiles of welcome as High Ridge was ushered through the door . The baron ignored his guide . Of course , Alexander thought . That was what peasants existed for-to bow and scrape for their betters . He shoved the thought deep and nodded as pleasantly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridge was even more slender than Cromarty , but on him it was all long , gangling arms and legs , and a neck like an emaciated soda straw . He 'd always reminded Alexander of a spider , except for the vulpine smile and cold little eyes . If central casting had sent him to an HD producer for the role of an over-bred , cretinous aristocrat , the producer would have sent him back with a blistering memo about stereotypes and typecasting . " Good evening , My Lord , " Cromarty said , extending his hand in greeting . " Good evening , Your Grace . " High Ridge shook hands with an odd , fastidious gesture-not , Alexander knew , something assumed for the occasion but simply his normal mannerism-and seated himself in the chair before the Prime Minister 's desk . He leaned back and crossed his legs , placing his seal of possession upon the chair , and Cromarty and Alexander resumed their own seats . " May I ask what brings you here , My Lord ? " the duke asked politely , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Grace . One is a rather , um , disconcerting bit of information which has reached my ears . " He paused , one eyebrow cocked , enjoying his own sense of power as he waited for the duke to ask what he meant . It was another of his more irritating little tricks , but , like all of the others , the realities of political survival required his host to swallow it . " And that bit of information is ? " Cromarty inquired as pleasantly as possible . " I 'm told , Your Grace , that the Admiralty is considering pressing charges against Lord Pavel Young before a court-martial , " High Ridge said with an affable smile . " Naturally I realized there could be no foundation to the rumors , but I thought it wisest to come directly to you for a denial . " Cromarty 's was a politician 's face , accustomed to telling people what he wanted it to tell them , but his lips tightened and his eyes smoldered as he glanced at Alexander . His political second in command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " May I ask , My Lord , just where you heard this ? " Cromarty asked in a dangerous voice , but High Ridge only shrugged . " I 'm afraid that 's privileged , Your Grace . As a peer of the realm , I must safeguard my own channels of information and respect the anonymity of those who provide me with the facts I require to discharge my duty to the Crown . " " Assuming a court-martial were being contemplated , " Cromarty said softly , " that fact would be legally restricted to the Admiralty , the Crown , and this office until the decision was made and publicly announced-a restriction designed , among other things , to protect the reputations of those against whom such actions are contemplated . The individual who provided it to you would be in violation of the Defense of the Realm Act and the Official Secrets Act , and , if a serving member of the military , of the Articles of War , not to mention the oaths he-or she-has personally sworn to the Crown . I insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And I respectfully refuse , Your Grace . " A corner of High Ridge 's lip curled in disdain at the very thought that laws applied to him , and a dangerous , fulminating silence hovered in the office . Alexander wondered if the baron even realized just how fragile was the ice upon which he stood . Allen Summervale would tolerate a great many things in the name of politics ; violation of DORA or the Official Secrets Act was n't one of them , especially not in time of war , and High Ridge 's refusal to identify his informant constituted complicity under the Star Kingdom 's law . But the moment passed . Cromarty 's jaw ridged , and his eyes glittered ominously , but he shoved himself further back in his chair and made himself inhale deeply . " Very well , My Lord . I wo n't press you-this time , " he said in a hard voice that , for once , made no effort to conceal his opinion of the other . Not that High Ridge seemed to notice ; the threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he smiled again . " Thank you , Your Grace . I 'm still waiting for you to deny the rumor , however . " Alexander 's fist clenched under the cover of the edge of Cromarty 's desk at the man 's sheer gall , and Cromarty regarded the baron with icy eyes for several long seconds of silence . Then he shook his head . " I ca n't deny it , My Lord . Nor will I confirm it . The law applies even to this office , you see . " " Indeed . " High Ridge shrugged off the pointed reminder and tugged delicately at the lobe of one ear . " If , however , there were no truth to it , I feel certain you would deny it , Your Grace . Which , of course , suggests that the Admiralty does , indeed , intend to prosecute Lord Young . Should that be the case , I wish to register the strongest protest , not simply for myself , but for the entire Conservative Association . " Alexander stiffened . Pavel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Hollow and the Conservative Association 's whip in the House of Lords . He was also , as everyone in this room knew , the most powerful single man in the Association . He was the king-maker , ruler of the Association 's back rooms , armed with a deadly nose for scandal and intrigue , which made the private files he was reputed to maintain a terrifying political weapon . " May I ask the basis for your protest ? " Cromarty asked sharply . " Of course , Your Grace . Assuming the information in my possession is accurate-and I think it is , given your refusal to deny it-this is only one more step in the Admiralty 's unwarranted persecution of Lord Young . The Navy 's persistent efforts to make him some sort of whipping boy for the tragic events on Basilisk Station have been an insult and an affront which , I believe , he has borne with remarkable equanimity . This , however , is a far more serious situation , and one that no one with a decent respect for justice can allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat at High Ridge 's sanctimonious tone . He made a strangled sound , but Cromarty shot him a quick warning glance and he clenched his jaw and made himself stay in his chair . " I strongly disagree with your characterization of the Admiralty 's attitude towards Lord Young , " the Prime Minister said sharply . " And even if I did n't , I have no power-or legal right-to intervene in the affairs of the Judge Advocate General 's Corps , particularly not over something as speculative as a court-martial which has n't even been officially announced yet ! " " Your Grace , you 're Prime Minister of Manticore , " High Ridge replied with an indulgent smile . " You may lack the power to intervene , but Her Majesty certainly does n't , and you 're her first minister . As such , I earnestly advise you to recommend to her that this entire proceeding be dropped . " " I can not and will not undertake such an action , " Cromarty said flatly , yet something inside him sounded an alarm , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange sense of triumph , not alarm or even irritation . " I see , Your Grace . Well , if you refuse , you refuse . " The baron shrugged and his smile was unpleasant . " With that out of the way , however , I suppose I should turn to my second reason for calling upon you . " " Which is ? " Cromarty asked curtly when the baron paused once more . " The Conservative Association , " High Ridge said , eyes gleaming with that same , strange triumph , " has , of course , made a very careful study of the Government 's request for a declaration of war against the People 's Republic of Haven . " Alexander stiffened once more , eyes widening in horrified disbelief , and High Ridge glanced at him , then went on with a sort of gloating exultation . " Naturally , the Havenite attacks on our territory and warships must be viewed with the gravest concern . Given recent events within the People 's Republic , however , we believe that a more ... reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires to act promptly and powerfully against the Havenites , but the Admiralty often suffers from the shortsightedness of a military institution and overlooks the importance of restraint . Interstellar political problems have a way of working themselves out over time , after all , particularly in a position such as this . And , from the Association 's viewpoint , the Admiralty 's unmerited hostility towards Lord Young is a further indication that its judgment is ... not infallible , shall we say ? " " Get to the point , My Lord ! " Cromarty snapped , all pretense of affability abandoned , and High Ridge shrugged . " Of course , Your Grace-to the point . Which is , I fear , that I must regretfully inform you that if the Government pushes for a declaration of war and unrestricted military operations against the People 's Republic at this time , the Conservative Association will have no choice but to go into opposition as a matter of principle . " ( Continues ... )               @ @ @ @ @ @
