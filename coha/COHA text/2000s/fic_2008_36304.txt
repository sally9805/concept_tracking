Monday Night <p> Lucy Newroe hated the word supererogation . It was one of those ridiculous words you 'd see in a Reader 's Digest Word Power quiz . Like quidnunc or sesquipedalian  --  words whose only purpose was to make the user look smart and the listener feel stupid . <p> Lucy had no clue what supererogation meant , and she did n't know how to spell it . Obviously , neither did the reporter who had written the story she was editing  --  he had spelled it " superaregation . " The spell check on Lucy 's computer wanted her to change it to " super are nation , " as if that made more sense . <p> Normally , she would have taken the word out , but it was in a direct quote : " ' The constant superaregation by the director bordered on the absurd , ' said audience member Jake Plumber . " <p> There was no changing of quotes in news stories . Either she took the word out and paraphrased the quote or kept the word in and figured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lucy said to her computer . No one even turned to look . It was about 11:30 p.m . Her side of the newsroom was empty except for her and a lone reporter , while the copy- desk side was full of people working quietly . The story deadline had come and gone , but the page deadline still was an hour away . The dance- company review she was editing did n't need to be done until tomorrow . As the night city editor , she had to wait until the copy desk finished its pages before she could go home . <p> Lucy got up to look for a dictionary as her phone rang . She picked it up and rambled off her phone introduction without even thinking  --  " Capital Tribune newsroom . This is Lucy Newroe . How can I help you ? "  --  as she tried to make the phone cord reach to the dictionary on the shelf . <p> " Is Harold there ? " <p> Lucy recognized the voice . It was old and female . " It 's just me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the dictionary . <p> " How about Steve ? " <p> Lucy smiled . Scanner Lady always wanted to talk to the male editors , never to her . " I 'm it . You 're stuck with me , I guess . What 's going on ? " <p> Scanner Lady hesitated . Lucy thought she was going to hang up . <p> " Well , I do n't know , " said the voice . <p> " Did you hear something on the police scanner ? " Lucy asked , as she paged through the S 's in the dictionary  --  was it " supere " or " supera " ? <p> " I think I did . " Scanner Lady hesitated again . " I think I heard two Santa Fe police officers talking about calling in the OMI and the state police . " <p> Lucy tossed down the dictionary and started taking notes . Calling in the Office of the Medical Investigator meant a dead body , and calling in the New Mexico State Police to investigate meant that what ever had happened , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over any case that concerned a law enforcement officer . <p> Lucy snapped her fingers at Tommy Martinez , the night cops reporter . He turned and looked at her as she pointed to her phone . He knew what it meant . He grabbed his note pad and ran over to Lucy 's desk . <p> " So you heard the Santa Fe cops call out the OMI and state police ? " She was repeating it for confirmation and so that Tommy could hear . He guessed who it was on the phone . <p> " Thank God for Scanner Lady , " he whispered , and started taking notes . <p> Lucy ignored him and said into the phone , " When was this ? " <p> " Just a few minutes ago , " Scanner Lady said . " I do n't want to say any more . Just listen to your scanner . " <p> But Lucy had been listening to the scanner  --  it sat on a shelf right above her desk  --  and she had n't heard anything . It was n't unusual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two scanners in the newsroom  --  one on her desk and one in the photo department , twenty feet away . The one in photo picked up more calls from the city police , while hers picked up more county calls and an occasional cell- phone call . <p> But both scanners were quiet . The last call had been something about a truck full of teenagers skidding into an icy arroyo . <p> " Are you sure ? " Lucy asked . " I have n't heard anything . Can you tell me anything more ? What exactly did they say ? " <p> " Just listen . I 'm sure you 'll hear it . " <p> Lucy heard the finality in her voice , but she still had so many questions . Were the voices male or female ? What made her think it involved the Santa Fe city police and not the Santa Fe County Sheriff 's Department ? Had they said whether the killing was in the line of duty or something else ? <p> Scanner Lady always played it like this  --  never giving out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called about once a week . It had become a sort of game for Lucy to figure out who she was . Scanner Lady 's voice was old , raspy . Maybe a smoker ? She was definitely Anglo . Once , Lucy almost got her <p> to inadvertently mention what side of town she lived on , but Scanner Lady went into a coughing fit and hung up before revealing anything . She never mentioned having children or a husband . And she never gave her reason for calling in with her tips . Did she just need someone to talk to ? <p> Most of the time , her calls amounted to nothing . But a few times , what she had heard had turned into a story . That was enough that Lucy never ignored her . <p> Lucy hung up and looked down at her notes . All she had written was : <p> OMI <p> State cops <p> Santa Fe <p> Dead body ? ? ? <p> She looked at her watch  --  11:34 p.m . This was going to be tough . Tommy was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night supervisor at the state police . He looked up at her <p> and shook his head . <p> " Just give it your best shot , Tommy . We 've gotten stories later than this , " she said . <p> And they had . Just last week they 'd had a stabbing at 11:45 p.m. and managed to get a ten- inch story in the paper by the 12:30 p.m. page deadline . But a story involving the possible investigation of a police officer and a dead body was something else . Getting that story during working hours was a chore ; this late at night , it was next to impossible . <p> Lucy was too anxious to sit . She walked over to the copy- desk side of the newsroom and watched the editors design the pages for tomorrow 's paper . Across the office , she heard Tommy unleashing his phone charm . He must have been talking to a female police dispatcher : he was laughing a lot  --  a teasing , swinging laugh . Lucy heard him say , " A la ve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " He slipped between the local Spanish and English , busting out his best Northern New Mexico accent for the English . His vowels were twice the normal length , stretching out the words into a singsong lullaby . His English had no hard consonant edges and his Spanish was not quick- step Mexican Spanish , but the slow , taffy- pulling colonial Spanish still spoken in Santa Fe . <p> Tommy was a Northern New Mexico farm boy , the second youngest of nine from a family who had lived in the mountain village of Ojo Sarco for fifteen generations . His grandmother spoke no English , only the Old New Mexico Spanish , as did all his great- uncles and - aunts still on the farm . Tommy had been the first child in his family to finish college , although a sister had done time in a vocational school for paralegals . Why Tommy had decided to become a journalist , Lucy still did n't know . But he 'd been born to it . <p> His technique for gathering news tips relied heavily on females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police dispatchers of his love for his mother 's tamales and how he missed his sisters . He would tell the young female dispatchers about his love for country- western music and how he lived for the smell of a woman after sex . And in return , they would tell him anything . <p> Lucy jumped as one of the copy editors spoke . <p> " Lucy , you 're making me nervous . Would you stop pacing ? " the editor said without looking up as he typed in a headline . <p> She went back to her desk , sat down , and stared at the wall , trying to relax . The room was windowless , like the sensory- deprivation cells used by the KGB to break American spies . The newsroom was painted sea- foam green , with matching cubicle dividers splitting the space up into play house- size streets and alleys . The ceiling was low , with the obligatory fluorescent lights that occasionally strobed . The color of the walls and the artificial light gave everything an aquarium feel , right down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . <p> The building itself was a mishmash of old and new . Part of it was from the 1800s , the rest from the 1970s . The result was sloping tiled floors where an errant step up would meet three steps down . Walls stopped and started in random patterns . According to office legend , the Capital Tribune had been built on top of the graves of Spanish colonialists killed during the Pueblo Revolt , the odd bumps and angles of the floor made when the coffins were paved over . Some of the night press workers claimed that sometimes , late at night , they heard a woman crying and praying the rosary in Spanish . One of the advertising reps had once come in to work at dawn and supposedly seen a man gliding down a hallway dressed in the brown robes of a mission priest . Lucy wondered if you could use " saw a ghostly vision " as an excuse to take a sick day . <p> Lucy glanced over at Tommy as he hung up the phone , flipped through his Rolodex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " This is Tommy Martinez , from the Capital Tribune . Who is this ? " The person on the other end said something and Tommy smiled , saying , " Beth Ann ? I do n't think we 've met . What 's your last name ? " Lucy shook her head . Poor Beth Ann , she did n't stand a chance . By the end of the conversation she would be telling Tommy everything , including when they would be getting together for drinks . <p> Tommy paused on the phone , waiting for Beth Ann 's answer . " You 're a Garcia ? Are you related to Tony Garcia who works at Pep Boys ? . . . No ? . . . How about Sarah Garcia at the state land office ? . . . No ? . . . Of course , oh yeah , I know your sister . . . . Me ? I 'm from Ojo Sarco . " Tommy started to laugh . " Yeah , the hillbilly Martinezes . . . " They continued with the expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had mutual friends . <p> The Martinezes , Garcias , Vigils , Trujillos  --  all the native Hispanic families in Santa Fe  --  were related somehow , their blood intermingling through marriage for more than four hundred years . The Spanish conquistadores came to Santa Fe in the early 1600s , and the settlers followed soon after . A Garden of Eden , with a handful of Spanish Adams and Eves . The other Spanish colonies in America did n't survive the eventual flood of immigrants . But in Santa Fe , protected by high- desert sands and a wreath of surrounding mountains , there was no flood . The colonists planted apple orchards and built adobe churches , all the while keeping the Old Ways . They were not Mexican . Not truly Spanish . They were colonial Spanish . Castilian . <p> Lucy waited until Tommy hung up the phone . She walked over to him and he told her what she had expected to hear : He had called the state cops , the Santa Fe police , the hospitals , the Santa Fe County sheriff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Tommy , you 're heading out to the police station tomorrow morning to do your cop checks , right ? Maybe we can look into it more then , " Lucy said . <p> Twice a day reporters went to the Santa Fe police station to look over the incident reports to see if anything warranted a story . In the hot sheets last week , there had been a small item about a man setting fire to his house and running around it naked while singing " Amazing Grace . " It had made an amusing story and had been picked up by the national news services . <p> " Actually , the Gomez trial gets started tomorrow , remember ? " Tommy said . <p> Lucy had n't remembered . Sam Gomez had allegedly shot into a crowd of people during the Christmastime performance of Las Posadas two years ago , wounding the woman who played the Virgin Mary . The trial was attracting statewide attention and had to be covered . <p> She thought for a second . " I 'll do it . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into work . " <p> Tommy looked surprised . According to newspaper etiquette , editors did n't do grunt work . She should have assigned it to a different reporter instead of going herself . <p> " I have to get up early anyway , " she added . <p> Tommy looked doubtful but said nothing . He wished her good night as he left . <p> Lucy looked down at her desk . The dictionary stared back up at her , still opened to S. Lucy sat down and pulled the dictionary to her . <p> She found it right after superduper . Supererogation , with one o and two e 's . " It meant " the act of doing more than what is required or expected . " <p> She smiled to herself . She really did have to get up early  --  sort of . <p> Patsy Burke sat in her easy chair , flipping channels . It was almost one a.m . She stopped when she reached Law &amp; Order , her husband 's favorite . It was a rerun , but she did n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem new to her . She smiled at her joke . <p> A detergent commercial came on , but the announcer 's voice was too high for her hearing aid , so she muted the sound . As she watched a voiceless laughing woman get stains out of her skirt , Patsy thought about the conversation she 'd had with her granddaughter three days ago . <p> " Grandma , what would you have been if you could have been something ? " Brittany had asked . Brittany was doing a school project on choosing a career . As if babies her age should be thinking about such things , Patsy thought . They should be making zoo animals out of straws or pasting oak leaves onto construction paper . <p> But in the end , Patsy had played along . <p> " An astronaut , " she said , thinking that it would please her . Brittany loved Justin Timberlake and  --  since the family had gone on vacation to Cape Canaveral last summer  --  space exploration . <p> " No , Grandma , you hate flying . Now really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She 'd been born during the Depression and had grown up practical . What was that Doris Day song ? " Que Sera , Sera " ? Patsy had never been to college . She and John had married straight out of high school . The day after their honeymoon to Kansas City was over , she moved out of her parents ' farm house and into John 's parents ' home . But she had dreamed of college , even though her mother had always said , " Do n't live beyond your means , or dream beyond your dreams . " One of the town girls Patsy went to high school with had gone to college , but the girl had dropped out after only four months to get married . Not that the girl would have had much of a choice . In their day , proper women picked from only two careers  --  nurse or teacher . <p> Now her granddaughter was asking her to make the choice she 'd never had . Patsy said the first thing that came into her head . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since then , Patsy had played the game by herself , changing her chosen profession from day to hour . So far she had been a police officer , a beekeeper , a nurse , a florist , a professional traveler , and a TV news anchor . Today it was a talk- show host for the geriatric set , an Oprah in her eighties . " Okay , audience , today our topic is dentures . " Patsy smiled , thinking she would tell her next- door neighbor Claire that one . <p> The show came back on and she turned up the sound . It was about a small boy who had been killed . As they showed the boy 's body , she realized that he looked like George . Patsy quickly turned the channel . She flipped stations until she was sure that the shot of the dead boy was over , then settled back down to watch . <p> At least the tears had n't come this time . She had n't thought of George in months . She wondered if that meant she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to remember the last time she had thought of him . But she could n't . She got up slowly , her bad hip giving her a twinge . She <p> tried to do the yoga breathing that Claire was teaching her . Something about breathing into the pain . But after a few puffs of breath in and out , she gave up and walked stiffly to her bedroom . She pulled open the drawer of her nightstand , rattling a few prescription bottles on top of the table . She opened the cover of her white- covered Bible and pulled out four photographs . The top one was in black- and- white . George smiling back at her . <p> He was only a year old in the picture . George had n't cried at all when the flashbulbs went off , making that loud pop . He 'd hammed it up , smiling even more . The photographer had called him " a natural . " John had n't wanted her to spend the money at the photo studio , saying that they should wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more family Christmas pictures . Four months after the photo was taken , George was trying to catch pollywogs in the creek by their farm , with John nearby putting up fence posts . George was blue when they found him in the water . <p> That had been more than forty years ago . They had never discussed it . She and John had packed up the farm house and moved to Wichita within a week . For two years they lived in a small apartment with only one room and rusty pipes . She was never able to scrub out the rust stains from the porcelain sink . <p> The floorboards creaked so badly that Patsy barely moved while she stayed at home all day , finding ways to silently iron , cook , and clean . As if any noise might remind her that George was dead . <p> Patsy pulled out the picture underneath the one of George . It was of her and her sons John Junior and Harold running in a sprinkler in front of a ranch- style home . On the back in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8 . Harold , 6 . " They had bought the house and moved out of the apartment as soon as she got pregnant with John Junior . The house had been built in a new subdivision . All the homes looked alike and had big grass yards . John fenced their yard in as soon as John Junior could walk . When the boys started elementary school , they wanted to take swimming lessons at the high- school pool with their friends , but John said that they could n't afford it . Patsy did n't ask him about it . Instead , she and the boys spent the summer days running and jumping in the sprinkler . <p> The next photo was of John in his long- sleeved police uniform . She turned the photo over . It said , " Wichita , Fourth of July Parade , 1963 , " in her handwriting . John had been on the force almost twelve years by then . He looked tired in his navy wool dress uniform . He had just made sergeant a few months earlier and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo had been taken just a year ago , during a family reunion at John Junior 's house in Albuquerque . Patsy sat in the middle . Her two sons on either side with their wives , her six grandchildren , and two great- grandchildren . Seven- year- old Brittany was her youngest grandchild . John Junior 's young second wife had wanted more children . Patsy took off her glasses and looked at the picture more closely , the photo almost touching her nose . She smiled . She looked pretty good for an eighty-two- year- old great- grandma . But she looked odd standing with her family without John next to her . <p> She and John had retired to New Mexico six years ago to be near John Junior . They had searched for homes in Albuquerque but finally settled in Santa Fe , where the homes were more expensive but the higher altitude was better for John 's health . Within three years , he died of a stroke . Her friend Claire said that retirement had killed John . And Patsy thought that might be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking up projects to do and then not finishing them . Out in the garage , there were still some bookshelves he had been making . <p> She heard a noise out in the living room and limped out of her bedroom , once again trying Claire 's yoga breathing . It still did n't work . The squealing was coming from the police scanner next to the easy chair , momentarily hurting Patsy 's hearing aid . She muted the volume on the TV and turned up the scanner . <p> " Medic One , 1225 San Francisco Street , elderly woman with chest pains . " Patsy wrote down the call in her journal and said a quick prayer for the woman . <p> Lucy drove around the block a few times before she found a parking space in the dim light . It was just after 11:30 p.m. , but the streets around the Cowgirl bar were still filled with cars . She sat in the front seat , prepping herself in the rearview mirror ; she reapplied her lipstick , brushed her hair , and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to poke herself in the eye . She wiped the eyeliner away , but now it looked like she had a case of pink eye . Very attractive . Oh well , at least the red made her eyes look more blue . Accentuate the positive , right ? She bent over in her seat and adjusted her breasts in her bra  --  a burlesque move she had been doing since she was fourteen . When she sat back up , she had cleavage . <p> She got out of the car and headed through a wrought- iron gate that was almost off its hinges , past a cobblestone courtyard , and into the crouching adobe building . The Cowgirl was packed . She scanned the tables for the copy editors she was supposed to meet . The adobe- brick walls were painted a sickly <p> salmon color and covered in 1950s photos of cowgirls in short fringed skirts and red lipstick . The chandeliers were made of the antlers of deer and steers . Behind the copper- tin bar was a brass wall hanging of a naked cowgirl lounging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chafing . <p> The crowd was a mix of locals taking advantage of dollar- beer night , tourists in town for the ski season , and convention-goers with their name tags still on . A woman named Lisa Smiley  --  if her name tag was to be believed  --  walked by with four beers . <p> Lucy stood on the bottom rung of an empty bar stool to get a look over the crowd . The French had made up a word for someone her size : petite . And for that she was eternally grateful . She would have hated shopping in the " lady dwarf " section at Sears . <p> Lucy spotted the copy editors at a table in the corner . She made her way through the crowd and was about to sit down when she realized that the Capital Tribune copy editors were n't alone  --  they were sitting with a group of reporters from the competing Santa Fe Times . Hell . Damn . She looked around to make sure Del was n't there . He was n't . Thank God . The table was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . She wiggled her way down toward the men . <p> In grade school , some students always sat in the front of the class and some always sat in the back ; she always sat with the boys . Not because she was interested in them romantically  --  that became an issue only after she 'd hit puberty  --  but because women made her uncomfortable . She could never figure out the social nuances . The female social system was too complex and required a set of emotional skills that she did n't understand . And she was never very good at " girl things "  --  she hated shopping for clothes  --  and she loved action movies . Whenever she met a woman for the first time , Lucy always felt like she was skipping steps two through four in a required dance . <p> Men were easier . They made sense . She was never worried whether they were smarter than she or more clever  --  when it came to competing with men , she knew she would always win . With women she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be average . She might be blah . <p> She was the middle child  --  sandwiched between two boys , a year apart on either side . She was neither the youngest nor the oldest . Stuck in limbo . To get noticed , she became the toughest , smartest , and funniest of the boys . She simply ignored the fact that she was n't a boy . <p> When Lucy was twelve , her mother took her to the Clinique counter at Macy 's to get a make over . When Lucy wore her new makeup to school the next day , the boys made fun of her and gave her the once- over , but it was the girls ' reaction that was more interesting  --  they talked to her . They asked her about shades of eye shadow and how to apply mascara . That 's when she got it  --  look like a girl , act like a boy . Last week she had spent sixty dollars on a haircut  --  not to attract men but to impress women . Two girls at work had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes about hair dye and wondered out loud if Lucy should get highlights in her dark blond hair . Still , at best , all Lucy could manage to strike up was a casual acquaintanceship with a woman . <p> As Lucy approached the table , she made one of the male copy editors scoot his chair over when she sat down . The two male reporters on either side of her moved over as well . The women eyed her from the other end of the table . Lucy hoped it was a friendly look . The waitress came over and Lucy ordered a Sprite , not wanting to fall into another Monday- night drinking bout . Last Monday , she had n't gotten home until six a.m. and had to throw up for an hour before the bathroom stopped spinning . She 'd felt like an idiot . Drinking that heavily in college was expected ; when you 're twenty- eight , it 's bordering on alcoholism . <p> She listened to the Santa Fe Times reporters debate whether cheerleading was a sport while the waitress set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach under her hair to touch the back of her neck . Del Matteucci . She turned around . He was holding a beer and giving her that crooked smile that she loved . Damn . <p> " Where 's your woman ? " she asked , her voice colder than she 'd intended . Was she still that angry ? <p> " She 's working late , " was all he said as he slipped into a chair next to her , left vacant by a copy editor heading off to the bathroom . <p> Lucy nodded and turned back to her Sprite , not able to think of anything else to say . They had n't really spoken that much since they broke up six months ago . They had seen each other . Said hi . The usual . But talk about the breakup ? Never . <p> " You are n't drinking ? " he asked . She could smell the beer on him . She looked down at her Sprite . <p> " Actually , I 'm just getting started . " She leaned over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to her , asking " What 's your favorite color ? " <p> " Green , " he said and pulled her closer . <p> " Green it is . " She motioned to the waitress as Del watched her curiously . <p> " I want a green drink , " she told the waitress . Lucy smiled brightly as she turned back to the sports reporter . She knew what she was doing . Exacting her own sort of revenge . Flirt with all the boys and make Del watch . It was petty , but it would do . She needed alcohol for courage . She asked the sports reporter if she could use his shoulder as a pillow as the waitress showed up with something called a green iguana . It smelled of tequila and sweet- and- sour mix . She took a gulp . It did n't make her throw up , so she took another . <p> An hour and three more colors later  --  red , orange , and blue  --  Lucy felt Del 's hand on her knee . It stopped her cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her thigh . She got up silently and went to the bathroom . Alone . She wished for a second that she had some version of a female friend , so that they could gab to each other about boys while they peed . She would have to manage this on her own . <p> Her boyfriend  --  she never quite remembered to put the " ex " in front of that  --  was hitting on her . Del was hitting on her . She had daydreamed of something like this . Of course , her fantasy involved him begging and crying . And beating on his chest in agony at her indifference . Make it very All My Children . <p> Two top- heavy blondes with Texas hair came tripping into the bathroom . They had tiny purses that matched their completely inappropriate sundresses . Had these women never heard of January ? They jiggled their way into the bathroom stalls , talking about someone named Tracy . <p> Lucy stared back at herself the mirror , concentrating not on her face but on the weird reflection made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fe a year ago for Del . He had wanted to come ; she had wanted to stay in Florida . But she was in love . So they moved . She became night city editor at <p> the Capital Tribune and he took a photography job at the Santa Fe Times . Six months later , they split up . <p> She washed her hands in the bathroom sink without thinking and crumpled a paper towel into the wastebasket . She crushed a few more paper towels into balls for good mea sure , resisting the urge to stomp them into the floor . She was too drunk to make sense of her feelings . And the blondes sounded <p> like they were about to leave their stalls , so she took a deep breath and walked back to the table , stumbling a bit from the alcohol . She sat back down  --  next to Del , out of habit . He said , " Hey , baby , " in the sloppy language of drunks and leaned over to massage her shoulder with one hand , his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasure but with rage . Fury . Wrath . All those good Old Testament words but with a tinge of heartbreak . How dare he ? How dare he think that she would get drunk and go back to him as if nothing had happened ? How dare he destroy her , unmake her , unmold her , and then come back for seconds ? <p> Lucy had the Wonder Twins power that most women possess : the ability to flirt outrageously with a repulsive man . Or a despised man . There are various reasons women do it : It 's a power trip for the pretty , and it can be turned into a fast- acting man- bug repellent . Lucy always used it for the latter reason . The flirt- and- destroy combination had served her well in college . A man who assumes that women must kneel in worship when faced with his magnetism can be tortured into a bloody , humble pulp with charm and the right words . The girl starts with normal flirting , whispered tones , and a soft smile . Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly begin to lick their lips and excessively toss their hair . The pros move right into an accidental brush- of- hand- against- back and a few well- placed out- of- corner- of- eye looks . If the girl is enjoying herself , she can continue ; but Lucy usually stopped it at that point , using one swift word or phrase to cut the man . Not deep , but fatally . If the girl is very good , she can do all this within a matter of minutes . Lucy liked to think she was that good . <p> She grabbed Del 's bottle of beer out of his hand and took a sip of it while he watched . She fondled the long neck of the bottle as suggestively as she could . She frowned . She was a little too drunk to be convincing . Her timing was off . She put the bottle down and almost spilled it . She started to laugh . Maybe she was n't as good at this as she 'd thought . <p> Del touched her hand on the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned her palm up and traced her lifeline with his index finger , the touch giving her a shiver . " And I 've always loved your hands , " he said . <p> " That 's not the only body part of mine that you 've loved , " she said with an out- of- the- corner- of- her- eye glance . <p> " But it 's the only part I can love in public unless you want people to stare . " <p> " There 's a lot of fun things we can do in public with our hands . We just need to get imaginative . " <p> " Like what ? " <p> Lucy switched her voice to that of a scolding schoolmarm . " Well , I ca n't believe that you spilled your drink all over yourself . " She picked up a napkin and pretended to wipe off his shirt , her fingertips tracing a slow swirl across his neck , then slipping lower down on his chest , sneaking toward the waist of his pants , all the while saying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all the while smiling . <p> He grabbed her wrist just as she was nearing his belt . " If you go any lower I 'll be spilling more than my drink . " <p> " Really ? I 'd like to be around for that . " Del 's face changed when she said that . What had been a boyish smile was replaced by the hard edge of lust . <p> " We can go back to my place , " he said in a low tone . <p> " Cockroaches are scared to go to your place , " she said back softly . They had always had this teasing tension . It was part of their sexual combat . <p> " You can come over and help me clean . Remember the time we spent all night dusting off the kitchen table ? " He squeezed her hand  --  their fingers interlaced , their legs touching under the table . Lucy put her head on Del 's chest and took a deep breath .
