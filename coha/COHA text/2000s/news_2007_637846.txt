<p> WHEN the town of Huntington granted permission in 2000 to a developer to build a golf course community with 1,255 homes for buyers 55 or older , housing advocates complained that an opportunity to provide affordably priced homes for young families and for the elderly had been wasted . <p> In response , town officials struck a deal with the developer , SBJ Associates , to include 100 units of new attached homes to be sold at $125,000 each , and to build affordable two-bedroom homes in another development elsewhere in the town . In addition , SBJ paid $2.5 million into a town trust fund to be used to build other affordable units elsewhere in the town . <p> The deal became the template for a law that the town passed soon after construction began at the golf course community , called the Greens at Half Hollow , in the hamlet of Melville . This law requires that housing developers sell 20 percent of all units below market prices or contribute to the housing trust fund that would help build future affordable units . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Half Hollow are still unfinished , and the separate affordable development , called Ruland Road , named after its location , is still an empty lot with an as-yet-unapproved plan before the planning board for mostly one-bedroom units . In addition , the trust fund still lacks a complete advisory board to decide how to spend the money to build more affordable housing . <p> What is more , a crossfire of lawsuits have been triggered , involving the town , SBJ , residents of Greens at Half Hollow and a variety of advocacy groups . <p> Huntington 's housing law , and the Greens development deal , were among the first on Long Island to address the need for less expensive homes in a high-priced market . Many other towns and villages now have such laws , called inclusionary zoning . But the failures in Huntington illustrate the difficulties that developers and communities face . <p> The town has sued the developer and the developer 's bond companies twice each ; the developer has filed two lawsuits against the town ; and the Fair Housing of Huntington Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal court last week to force the town to make good on the settlement of an earlier lawsuit . <p> " The whole thing has turned into this big quagmire , " said Susan Lagville , executive director of Housing Help , a nonprofit agency . The town allowed 1,000 homes to be built on 279 acres , she said , " but very few affordable units and no affordable rentals , which we desperately need here . " <p> Housing Help is part of a larger group called the Huntington Township Housing Coalition , which presented a report to the town board in May titled " Broken Promises at the Greens . " The report contends that the town is embroiled in costly legal action because it did not enforce its agreement with the contractor during construction of the Greens . <p> The town passed a resolution in 2000 that required the developer to build the affordable units at the Greens and 200 one-bedroom units along Ruland Road , before officials would grant certificates of occupancy for the more expensive homes . Without the certificates , buyers of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But because many early buyers had sold their previous homes to pay for their Greens units and were stuck waiting in hotels or living with adult children , the town decided to grant occupancy certificates even though the affordable homes had not been finished , said Frank Petrone , the Huntington town supervisor . <p> That turns out to have been a mistake , Mr. Petrone added . " What went wrong here was the town , in proceeding and permitting the certificates of occupancy to be given , was dealing in good faith with respect to going forward with the project , " he said . <p> The affordable homes were never finished . And now the developer wants to raise the price of the units , whose outer shells have already been built , by $40,000 , to $165,000 . <p> Among those most determined to halt construction of the Greens project all along has been the Fair Housing of Huntington Committee , which in 2002 sued the town in federal district court in Islip . The claim was that the town was violating the federal Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Rich , a lawyer with the Lawyer 's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , a group based in Washington that handled the Huntington lawsuit . The committee 's request for an injunction on the project was denied twice . <p> The organization refiled an amended lawsuit in 2004 that focused on the one-bedroom homes planned for Ruland Road . It asserted that the plan discriminated against minority families , Mr. Rich said . In a settlement that did not involve the developer , the town agreed that 28 units at Ruland Road would have two bedrooms , making it possible for a small family to live there , Mr. Rich said . <p> But the town has not yet officially approved the settlement , he added , and the group asked the court last week to force the town to do so . <p> Meanwhile , there are still problems with the rest of the Greens development . Last December , the town sued for control of $13 million in bonds posted by the developer to ensure completion of the Greens . <p> John Leo , the Huntington town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints from residents about a lack of dry wells and sumps , causing pools of water in common areas that freeze in winter and pock the roads with potholes . The drainage problems have even prompted some residents to sue the developer on their own , Mr. Leo said . Six months ago the town , too , filed suit on the issue , seeking a court order to force the developer to make repairs , add dry wells and complete the affordable units . <p> In return , the Greens at Half Hollow has sued the town twice , to reduce the numbers of dry wells and force a decision by the court on the price of the affordable units . <p> John Harras , a lawyer for the developer , said SBJ Associates had " done everything we were supposed to do " with respect to roads and drainage , and had offered to work with town engineers to regrade parts of the Greens to address complaints . The Greens affordable units will be completed once a sale price is determined by the courts , Mr. Harras added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan is approved , he said . <p> But until the lawsuits are resolved , the affordable homes at the Greens and at Ruland Road remain unbuilt . <p> " The sum total of all of this , " said Ellen Schaffer , an assistant town attorney who has worked on the latest actions , " is we have a developer granted zoning to build over 1,000 market-price units who failed to produce any of the public benefits that were to come from the Greens .
