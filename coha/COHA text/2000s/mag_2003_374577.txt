The men standing in front of the pool hall would look up and see the big black crate ghost down the street at forty , and one of them would spit on the concrete and say , " The bastard , he reckins he 's somebody , " and wish that he was in a big black car , as big as a hearse and the springs soft as mamma 's breast and the engine breathing without a rustle . <P> Robert Penn Warren wrote those words about a Cadillac , in a novel set in the 1930s . Back then Caddies were what you drove to announce that you had power , which is why people desired them even as they loathed their owners . Today another automobile is inspiring such passions . As sport-utility-vehicle owner Amy Dickie says , " The SUV is the Cadillac of the new millennium . " Dickie is 30 , brokers insurance in Atlanta and owns a Lexus RX 300 . Ads hint the thing could haul a yak carcass across Tibetan grasslands ; though it 's one of the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Dickie uses it to drive , by herself , three miles each way to and from the office . She also occasionally lugs scuba gear in it , but mostly she likes its style . Which makes her much like millions of other Americans who have bought the big vehicles  --  drivers now surprised to find themselves labeled tools of terrorists in the brawl over SUVs . <P> In the past few weeks , what started in the ' 90s as a quiet debate among car buffs and greens has become , as former Nissan design chief Jerry Hirshberg says with a sigh , " a religious war . " On one side are devout environmentalists and icky Hollywood types , as well as reputable safety experts who say SUVs can be death machines . A lefty group called the Detroit Project has produced slick ads charging that because SUVs use so much gas , and because some of the crude oil for that gas comes from the Middle East , and because some oil-rich princes have funded Islamic extremists , SUV owners are supporting terrorists . ( Got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very seriously : on New Year 's Day , three Fords were set ablaze at a dealership north of Pittsburgh , Pa . There have been at least six other such attacks since 2001 . <P> On the other side are champions of the land barge . These assorted auto lobbyists , free-market enthusiasts and moms on car-pool duty say there 's nothing wrong with roominess , four-wheel drive and a seat high enough to give you a look at the world . Owing to their Establishment orientation , SUV partisans are n't burning anything ( except gas ) ; their defense is mostly carried out in sedate op-eds . After enduring months of attacks , pro-SUV forces cheered last month when it was disclosed that the Bush Administration wants to increase a tax break allowing small businesses to deduct much of the price of the heaviest SUVs from their taxes  --  even when those SUVs wo n't be hauling anything more than the boss and his morning Starbucks . <P> At first blush , then , the SUV war looks like a fight between two groups of elites  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Outback Steakhouse crowd , New York Times people vs . Wall Street Journal people . Keith Bradsher , a Times reporter , wrote High and Mighty , a book published in September that calls SUVs " the world 's most dangerous vehicles .
