Wetlands serve an important purpose in flood control and water quality , but constructed-wetland sites also provide habitats for mosquito breeding . Communities near constructed-wetland sites often raise a " mosquito " objection when constructed wetlands are proposed . Wildlife and wetland advocates can confuse the public by making unsubstantiated claims about natural predators eliminating or controlling mosquito problems in a constructed wetland . <p> Management of constructed-wetland mosquito habitat , with adequate mosquito surveillance and data analysis , can help lead to a successful project and satisfied citizens . The cooperative project described in this paper , was conducted in the town of Simpson , North Carolina , and was designed to determine the mosquito population impact of wetland construction at Mill Branch Stream , a small tributary of the Tar River in Eastern North Carolina . <p> In the authors ' analysis of three years of mosquito surveillance data , month ( time of year standing in for temperature and day length ) was a significant factor in regression analysis for mosquito numbers , but rainfall was not . Numbers of mosquitoes were not band to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With human cases of West Nile virus ( WNV ) and Eastern Equine encephalitis ( EEE ) again appearing in many states , ( U.S. Geological Survey USGS , 2005 ) , citizens in all states and locations must be kept informed and continually educated about mosquitoborne diseases . Many citizens , however , still harbor misconceptions about mosquito life cycles , habits , and habitats , which continue to confuse , frustrate , and anger them each summer . For example , new residents from Northern states may not be familiar with the species of mosquitoes that occur in Mid-Atlantic tidal areas , or with the periodicity of freshwater floodwater mosquitoes . Other examples are confusion about which mosquito species are vectors for disease and what types of habitat are required for any of the 60 species that occur in North Carolina . In a , local small town ( Simpson , North Carolina ) , concern was publicly voiced over the possible negative consequences of constructing a wetland near a residential area because of confusion over the species of mosquito that carry West Nile virus , the habitat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . Water quality improvements and other wetland services often come into conflict with citizen comfort and approval in wetland construction plans ( City of Phoenix , 1999 ; Reid , 2003 ) . Even in well-funded mosquito control districts ( as in Florida and New Jersey ) , the negative mosquito effects of wetland construction near residential areas is a public concern . The study reported here was a coordinated effort of the North Carolina Clean Water Management Trust Fund ( NCCWMTF ) , the Greenville North Carolina Resource Conservation and Development Office ( NCRCD ) , the North Carolina Public Health Pest Management Section ( NCPHPM ) , and East Carolina University to provide data that would address the question of whether mosquito populations would significantly rise and the question of what species would be present in a community after a new wetland was introduced . <p> The town of Simpson , North Carolina , was selected as the study site ( Figure 1 ) because of an NCRCD-planned small-wetland construction project . Simpson is a small but growing town east of Greenville with a population of about 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drainage during times of significant rainfall ( Pope , Tasker , &; Robbins , 2001 ) . Following Hurricane Floyd in 1999 , the Simpson area had a relentless mosquito problem , similar to that experienced by other small towns in Eastern North Carolina ( Anderson et al. , 2000 ) . In an effort to correct and improve drainage problems and to contribute to water quality , NCRCD 's Greenville office initiated a project to construct a wetland along the Mill Branch Creek in Simpson ( Figure 1 ) . There was concern within the NCRCD organization that local citizens would object to a constructed wetland because of the perceived potential for additional mosquito breeding . Therefore , North Carolina Public Health Pest Management was contracted to do a research project to aid in addressing this concern . Recent data support the claim that constructed wetlands add to mosquito problems in a local area ( Evans , 1996 ; Sharer , Lundstrum , Pfeiffer , Lundkvist , &; Landin , 2003 ) , but many factors besides wetland construction must be considered before cause is ascribed . Since some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from breeding sites , a jurisdiction-wide survey of mosquito populations in Simpson was needed to determine the current mosquito-breeding levels in the town . This survey would provide a baseline for determination of whether mosquito populations in and near the wetland construction site changed after wetland construction . Measures of rainfall , time of year , and temperature were included in the analysis to account for natural yearly variability . Local citizens living in the areas under surveillance were involved in the process of surveying for mosquitoes through door-to-door questioning , explanations of surveillance , and distribution of literature , including information about mosquito breeding . At town meetings , the options for management of mosquito population levels , such as larvaciding and adulticiding with Permethrin , were presented . <p> One important aspect of mosquito control that is new to most small-town local citizens and necessary for conducting efficient and effective mosquito control is the need for long-term data on mosquito species and breeding locations in a local area . There are about 200 different species of mosquitoes in the United States and nearly 60 in North Carolina ( North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Of these , Culex and Aedes species appear to be the most common mosquito vectors ( Godsey et al. , 2005 ) . Culex species are the predominant vectors of WNV . Of the 60 species found in North Carolina , the Asian tiger mosquito ( Aedes Stegomyia albopictus ) is the mosquito that generates the most complaints in urban areas . It is a potential vector of dengue fever , a disease currently not found in North Carolina . This mosquito breeds readily in any container that holds water for at least a week . Populations can rise dramatically after rainy weather ( North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services , 2006 ) . In light of the current sweep of West Nile virus across the United States , one of the main public health reasons for surveying and identifying mosquito species is to determine when and where there is elevated risk from WNV- or EEE-transmitting mosquitoes , so that people can be alerted and control measures can be increased before a human case is detected ( Kilpatrick et al. , 2005 ; Shaman &; Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and EEE involves several species of mosquito vectors , including Culiseta melanura , a bird-biting mosquito . <p> The town of Simpson resembles a small suburban habitat . In suburban Minnesota , Aedes vexans and Coquillettidia perturbans , both WNV-transmitting species , are the dominant species found in surveys , according to Jim Stark from the Metropolitan Mosquito Control District in Minneapolis . In the Midwest , Aedes vexans , a floodwater variety , accounts for 80 percent of all infestations ( Kronenwetter-Koepel , Meece , &; Miller , 2005 ) . Culex pipiens , found in many other suburban locations , is known as a stagnant-water variety and in many areas is one of the most dangerous species because it is a vector for many diseases , including WNV ( Molaei , Andreadis , Armstrong , Anderson , &; Vossbrinck , 2006 ) . Other problematic Culex species that are present in North Carolina include Cx. restuans , Cx. salinarius , and Cx. quinquefasciatus . If these species or other vectors are found in a jurisdictional area survey , it is important to inform citizens of the potential disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species present in a local area is to do biological surveillance throughout each mosquito season . Unfortunately , disease risk values are not easily correlated to specific mosquito population numbers ( Shaman &; Day , 2005 ) ; therefore , most mosquito control agencies manage mosquitoes to a given nuisance tolerance level . When WNV , EEE , or other mosquitoborne diseases have been detected in a town or county through surveys of dead birds , animal infections , or testing of collected mosquitoes , mosquito control is typically increased in the entire region . Work is progressing in the modeling of habitat and mosquito populations with the object of more closely tying control procedures to disease risk ( Shaman &; Day , 2005 ) . Methods <p> The town of Simpson is located in Pitt County , North Carolina , and was one of the many small towns in Eastern North Carolina that were flooded by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 . Since weather patterns change the habitat landscape each year and construction of new homes continually changes the physical landscape , continual surveillance was needed  --  but was not affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a necessary starting place for the investigation . New flood zone maps were made available in Pitt County following flooding from Hurricane Fran in 1999 . Flood zone maps do not show where wetlands or flooded areas are , but they do map potential flood zones by soil and vegetation types . They can be helpful in locating breeding habitat , but they do not cover every site , nor are all mapped flood zones breeding sites . <p> The initial survey plan for Year 1 of the study could also be used as a model for any local jurisdiction needing to determine mosquito-breeding levels and possible elevated risk for vectorborne disease . The plan consisted of deploying a trained team to investigate every neighborhood and the surrounding fields and woodlands for possible mosquito habitat . Since the first year of the study was 2000 , after the flooding of Hurricane Fran in Eastern North Carolina , federal money was available for training and employing students from East Carolina University in mosquito surveys for the Hurricane Floyd local recovery effort . The standard method for larval surveys is to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-inch dowel ) to sample water from every water-holding location found . Five to 10 dips were taken at water-holding sites . Sites that were positive for mosquito larvae over one entire year were marked on local county maps . Larval species were not identified , and sites at which first-instar larvae were found were not recorded as positive sites since it was not known at that stage whether the larvae would survive to third instar and adulthood . <p> A second step in the areawide surveillance was to trap adult mosquitoes . Standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) traps with dry ice providing CO 2 attractant were set at six locations , with a focus on protected vegetated areas near known breeding sites . These traps were set weekly during the second half of the first season ( 2000 ) . Two locations were near the planned wetland . Mosquitoes from the traps were sorted and identified by species , frozen , and stored for species confirmation and photography . Total numbers of mosquitoes per collection date and total numbers of each species of mosquito per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conducted in a wide area each year ( Harne , 2004 ) . In this study , however , limitations in resources necessitated that the focus be on only the proposed wetland site and one adult-trapping method . During the second , third , and fourth seasons , mosquitoes were collected from the wetland site and from other sites when possible . Construction of the wetland occurred in early 2002 . For part of the construction year and for one year following construction , standard adult CDC mosquito traps with CO 2 bait were set at the north and south ends of the new wetland ( Figure 1 ) . The two primary wetland mosquito collection sites were at the furthest downstream end of the wetland ( north ) and at the furthest upstream section of the wetland ( south ) . Collections were made at these two sites each week , adult mosquitoes were sorted out , and the mosquito species were identified . General Pitt County rainfall data were also collected for the four years of the study . <p> Wetland construction consisted of excavating and expanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small portion of the Mill Creek Branch leading to the Tar River . Vegetation was installed by a volunteer group from the town and the university as part of community involvement . A floodgate was installed at the culvert under Jethro Mills Road . Water levels in the new wetland could be adjusted with risers according to water flow in the creek . The department of transportation assisted in the construction by replacing the culvert and adding riprap along the ditches near the culverts . <p> Statistical analysis of mosquito count data for the wetland trap sites was carried out by a statistician in Allied Health Sciences at East Carolina University . The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Version 12.0 was used for data management and analysis . Descriptive measures and graphs ( box plots , histograms , and scatter plots ) were used to examine the distributions of all variables and to identify outliers , or anomalous or influential values . The analysis proceeded from a crude analysis of unadjusted preconstruction and postconstruction mosquito count means to several linear regressions adjusting the counts for month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and rainfall measured in inches . The residuals from these linear regressions were examined to determine the adequacy of the modeling strategies . Results from the two periods , preconstruction and postconstruction , were calculated as the mean , or mean difference in mosquito counts standard deviation , with 95 percent confidence intervals . Results Mosquito Population Characteristics and Rainfall <p> Figure 2 shows species of mosquitoes collected in the upstream and downstream traps near in early spring 2002 . <p> Rainfall and temperature are typically the most influential environmental factors in mosquito population fluctuations ( Anderson et al. , 2000 ; Brower , 2001 ) . In Figure 2 , the rainfall columns following each monthly mosquito collection column indicate relative rainfall amounts . Two examples of rainfall influence on mosquito populations are the relatively high rainfall amounts and high mosquito counts in the last two monthly samples in 2002 , when there was hurricane activity in coastal North Carolina . Numbers like these should trigger control measures regardless of species . Recent thinking in mosquito control is that nuisance = disease threat , because of the large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the threat of new or re-emerging diseases . In North Carolina , hurricane season starts in July , and typically mosquito populations build up during the latter part of the summer to peaks in September , when many storm-driven rain events occur . By the end of October , cool weather slows the activity of mosquitoes , and mosquito reproduction slows dramatically . <p> In raw numbers , 5,426 mosquitoes were collected in 2002 and 2003 , compared with 8,631 in 2000 and 2001 , in the two wetland sites combined . Statistical Analysis of Time and Rainfall on Mosquito Counts <p> Essentially there is no difference between the preconstruction and postconstruction periods when the preconstruction period is defined as 2000-2001 and the postconstruction period as 2002-2003 . These results hold for the crude analysis based on the two-sample t-test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test ( with and without outliers , or counts over 3,000 ) . The adjusted analysis using a linear regression including rainfall , month of the year , and period also shows no significant difference between preconstruction period and the postconstruction period . <p> The mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through graphs or formal tests of normality . The natural log of the counts , however , appears to be normal , and graphs and tests do not indicate that the log count is nonnormal . In addition , no outliers are indicated in the graphs for the log-transformed counts . <p> An analysis based on the natural log of the counts essentially shows the same results as for the counts  --  no significant differences between periods . Crude Analysis <p> When mean counts of mosquitoes between periods are compared with no adjustment for rainfall or month of the year , t-tests provide the same results : The t-test value was 1.099 , based on 22 degrees of freedom ( p = .284 ) . <p> The 95 percent confidence interval for the change in mosquito count was - 388.3 , 1,263.61 . This interval can be interpreted as showing that the data support anywhere from 388 fewer mosquitoes to upward of 1,264 more on average after construction . There was no significant difference in variability between the two periods ( Levene 's test for equality of variances p-value = .588 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the t-test comparing counts of mosquitoes was significant , but the nonparametric tests were not . The t-test value for a student 's t based on equal variances was t = 2.113 , with 20 degrees of freedom , p = .047 . The 95 percent confidence interval for the change in mosquito count was 4.9 , 756.91 . This interval supports anywhere from an additional 5 mosquitoes to 757 more postconstruction . The results of Levene 's test for the equality of variances for the two periods was also significant , however ( F = 6.79 , p = .017 ) . If the t-test for unequal variances is employed , then t = 2.002 , with 13.08 degrees of freedom and p-value = .066 , not quite statistically significant at the .05 level . Given the considerations of normality required for the t-test , the nonparametric tests would be considered more valid . Additional analysis based on the natural log of mosquito counts showed that this transformation led to a variable that met the assumptions for normality . The t-test for the transformed variable was t = 1.522 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Levene 's test was also not significant , p-value = .570 . Nonparametric test results would be the same as those above for the transformed variable . Box plots for the log-transformed variable also did not indicate any outliers , as compared to the nontransformed variable ( Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) . The transformed plots show that the two distributions are quite similar for the two periods , with slightly greater counts in the post-reclamation period , but not statistically significantly so , as discussed above . Adjusted Analysis <p> In a model summary of data with outliers of over 3,000 included , the R in regression analysis was .102 . None of the variables was noted to be significant . Removing the two outliers above 3,000 resulted in the model summaries A and B ( untransformed and transformed ) ( Table 1 , Table 2 ) . <p> The influence of the two outliers can be noted in the results shown in Table 1 and Table 2 . Month of the year is significant , and period , adjusted for rainfall and month of the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the outliers removed , the untransformed mosquito counts are not normally distributed . Since the overall sample size is small ( n = 23 with outliers and n = 21 without ) , the inference drawn from the above regressions may be questioned . Running the regression on the natural log-transformed counts ( which , from a statistical perspective , can not be said to be nonnormal ) gives results indicating that there is not a statistically significant increase in mosquito counts postconstruction after rainfall and month of the year are adjusted for . <p> In summary , it appears that there was some increase in the average count of mosquitoes , as well as in variability , from preconstruction to postconstruction . The increase was not , however , statistically significant . Discussion <p> Although there were no statistically significant differences in total population numbers after wetland construction , the data on mosquito species collected did yield significant findings , including information on the presence of potential mosquito vectors of WNV in the town and surrounding area . <p> Over the past five years of WNV transmission in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of transmitting the West Nile virus . The earliest species found positive for WNV were Aedes vexans , Culex pipiens , Culex restuans , and Culex salinarius ( Godsey et al. , 2005 ) . Recent research shows that these species are also the ones most likely to be transmitting WNV in future years , because of their ubiquity . Local management groups can use similar research information to direct intervention and control . <p> In the study reported here , for example , seven genera and 24 species of mosquitoes were collected in 2000 and 2001 . In 2002 and 2003 , six genera and 28 species of mosquitoes were collected . All of the currently listed common WNV vectors ( Ae . vexans , Cx. pipiens , Cx. restuans , and Cx. salinarius ) were commonly found in these collections ( CDC , 2005 ) . In addition , of the 20 or more species of mosquitoes in North Carolina capable of WNV transmission , six were collected in Simpson . <p> Mosquito census data show five species groups as percentages of the total monthly collections in Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culex restuans were the most numerous species collected in 2003 . Both of these species are vectors of WNV . Ae . vexans was present in higher numbers in the spring and the fall ; Cx. restuans peaked in July and August . Since Ae . vexans is a floodwater species , it can be assumed that this species responded to spring and fall rainfall and consequent flooding activities in the Mill Creek tributary that flows through Simpson . <p> In 2001 and 2002 , when six sites were sampled with CDC light traps , Ae . vexans was also found in the non-wetland locations and in high percentages in all but two sites . It is therefore not only the wetland habitat in which this species is breeding . <p> In 2001 , fewer mosquitoes were collected overall , but Ae . vexans or Culex species were found in each of the five collection sites . <p> Local survey work can inform mosquito management agencies about the amounts and timing of vector mosquito species in their locales , thus providing information for potential disease risk reduction strategies . Survey information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical times and places for prevention of disease transmission , and can save funds from unnecessary weekly spraying . A data-based response to vectorborne disease health problems is as valid and important in mosquito management as it is in all other health areas . <p> Although rainfall patterns in North Carolina vary from year to year , flooding rains are most often seen in the fall during hurricane activity and often occur in the spring following storms ( Pope et al. , 2001 ) . Further investigation into the resulting flooding patterns of the tributary creek in the Millcreek subdivision would also be useful in helping to abate the mosquito population in Simpson . <p> Since each of the other light trap collection sites yielded a variety of mosquitoes similar to those found in the wetland area , it can also be concluded that mosquito breeding is widespread in this town . Many breeding sites were small and could easily be altered , especially those on private property . Drainage ditches in many places needed minor cleaning and grading to prevent ponding of water . Farmland contiguous with housing developments had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drainage for these depressions would improve crop yield and cut down on mosquito production . <p> No manmade alteration in the environment , such as a constructed wetland , can escape having both beneficial and harmful consequences , so community managers and planners need to be aware of all the costs ( including health costs ) and benefits of each project that is proposed . When decisions about wetland-construction projects are based on the analysis of data , such as the mosquito surveillance data reported in this paper , they can give more rational and predictable outcomes to community changes . In addition , a study of mosquito numbers for two years after a wetland construction project may not be adequate to assess changes in insect populations . Each wetland construction situation has different ecological parameters that can affect results ( Sarneckis , 2002 ) . Conclusion <p> The construction of a wetland in the town of Simpson , North Carolina , did not significantly increase the population of mosquitoes collected ( Figure 2 ) . In four years of comparative study , more total mosquitoes were collected after a wetland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was shown that this difference was not significant . Month of the year ( a surrogate for temperature and day length ) was a significant variable , explaining the variability of counts . The wetland was small , and mosquito breeding was widespread throughout the town and surrounding area , according to the authors ' initial survey . For this reason , the authors concluded that under this ecological regime , increased mosquito populations are not a significant side effect of a small wetland construction project such as the one discussed in this paper . <p> As seen in the data on mosquito species and abundance , the composition and numbers of mosquitoes changed over the years of the study . Total numbers of mosquitoes were quite variable during the study , but were not significantly higher in the years after wetland construction . A thorough , longer-term study of actual mosquito breeding and production in a small wetland , with data obtained through mosquito emergence traps , would provide needed further information on mosquito breeding in suburban constructed wetlands in North Carolina . <p> Further work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also aid in the development of more specific guidelines for building new wetlands . In an unpublished survey done in 1979 in Arkansas rice fields , one of the authors found that mosquitoes and aquatic insect-predator species do not follow a set sequential succession , but , as in unstable communities in many disturbed habitats , reach an assemblage of species depending on surrounding " feeder " habitats . Then succession is again disrupted by drought or reflooding . The concept of " balance " of predators and prey involves averaging population fluctuations over many years , and balance is not readily measurable or achievable in the creation of wetlands . The concept is not useful for public defense of wetlands , especially since , in an unpredictable weather situation , disease can be transmitted in a single week 's brood of mosquitoes . The timing of the natural or human introduction of predatory fish and predatory insects is a critical factor not yet included in a total systems approach to designing and managing newly constructed wetlands , although predator presence is often claimed as a natural means of mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mosquito predator life in these wetlands has still not been told , and research in this area would help in the creation of more useful , sustainable , healthy wetlands for water quality improvement and for disease prevention . <p> Acknowledgements : This work was funded in part by the North Carolina Resource Conservation and Development Organization , through a grant from the North Carolina Clean Water Management Trust Fund .
