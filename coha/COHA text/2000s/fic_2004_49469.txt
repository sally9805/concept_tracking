Whenever I remember Lin , I think of taxicabs . We spent so much of our time sitting in the back of one , somewhere in Shenzhen-speeding away from the border-crossing station , or returning to it . In my memory it was always a bright morning , sun streaming through the dusty windows , or late at night , our bodies striped with the colors of the neon lights passing overhead . We sat on opposite sides of the seat , our hands folded , like brother and sister ; she would n't let me speak , or even touch her leg . If the driver heard my terrible Mandarin , she said , he and his friends would know exactly who she was : another country girl peddling herself to a Hong Kong man for easy money . <p> I obeyed her , of course . And that 's why I was so surprised the one time she broke her own rule . We had just turned the corner at the Kuroda hotel ; we were five minutes away from Lo Wu , the border crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If I do n't call you this week , what will you do ? <p> I 'll call you , of course . Why do you ask ? <p> No . That 's not what I mean . What if I never called you again ? <p> She had put on a new shade of lipstick that morning , one I had bought for her ; against her skin it looked like fresh blood . It made me shiver . <p> Then I would come and find you . One way or another . <p> But you could n't , she said . If you never called me , I could find your number in the Hong Kong directory . I could find your family and where you worked . But what could you do ? China is too big . If I disappear , that 's it . China will swallow me up . <p> She was right about the driver : he turned his head towards us as he drove , to hear better , and when we came to a traffic light he turned and gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all the curses I know are Cantonese , and he would n't have understood . <p> Lin , what do you want me to say ? I said . You 're right , of course . If you want to disappear , you can . One way or the other , it 's in your power . <p> Her eyes widened , as if my answer had made her suddenly angry . What makes you so sure of that ? she said . What makes you so confident ? <p> I did n't know what to say . We were pulling into the long line of taxis in front of the station ; the street was filled with people hurrying towards the entrance . My legs itched . I 'll see you next week , I wanted to say , but I knew , without wanting to know , that the words did n't matter . The driver turned around in his seat and looked from my face to hers , eager to hear the last line . I took out a wad of hundred-yuan bills and gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , she said , it 's like a dream , is n't it ? As if none of this ever really happened . That 's good . You should keep it that way . Sometimes dreams happen over and over again , sometimes they do n't . <p> Lin , I said , that 's the most ridiculous <p> She opened the door and strode away quickly , pushing through the crowd , like a fish , fighting its way upstream . <p> If it were not for Little Brother , I would never have thought about China . I live in the New Territories , not far from the border , and the train to Lo Wu passes through the station I use every day , but I had never once considered taking it there . I do n't have any relatives in China-my family has lived in Hong Kong for five generations-and I do n't like to travel . I 've never had that kind of curiosity . And I suppose I still remember the stories my parents ' friends told , about the Communists and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rows of bodies and babies impaled on bayonets . You could say that for me China was a place that only existed in the past , but not my past , a memory that was n't mine to have . <p> My own life is really very simple . My parents died years ago , when I was in college ; I was an only child , and they left me a portfolio of real estate holdings , and their apartment in Tai Wo . During the day I manage the accounts at an oil trader in Kwai Hing , and in the afternoon , every afternoon , I take the bus to the Shek O Sailboard Club , at the far southeastern tip of Hong Kong Island . If you 've ever taken a ferry or a junk trip around the island , you 've probably seen me in the distance , crossing your path : a tiny , dark figure attached to a bright triangle of sail , hurtling across the waves like a pebble from a slingshot . This is Big Wave Bay , where the typhoons come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My nickname is fei yu , flying fish , and it 's true . Two days out of the water is a lifetime to me . <p> It 'll take two hours , Little Brother told us one Friday night , in the back room of the Sha Tin Bar . Cross the border , change some money , take a taxi , pick up some boxes , and go back home . What could be easier than that ? <p> We looked at him skeptically . Little Brother is the youngest of five friends I 've had since primary school-the Five Brothers , we call ourselves-and like a real little brother , he 's the wild one : he dyed his hair blond and started racing motorcycles in Form Three , when he was only fourteen . Now he owns his own repair shop in Mong Kok and takes his grandmother to play mah jongg every Sunday . <p> What 's in the boxes ? Siu Wong asked him . <p> Parts . Honda parts . <p> Are they stolen ? <p> How should 1 know ? All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pay for them to come from Japan . <p> Why do you need all five of us ? I asked . <p> You never know what 's going to happen , he said . It 's Shenzhen , is n't it ? And I thought we might explore a little bit , since we 're there . You know , Hong Kong people live like kings in China . The best of everything . He winked . <p> I hesitated : it was n't my idea of a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon in April . But if he wanted my help , how could I refuse ? It sounded so easy-all I had to do was bring my passport . <p> None of the five of us are married . I should have mentioned that . <p> When you step out of the border-crossing into Shenzhen , at first it seems that the air is full of dust , but actually it 's the pollution that gives the light a milky quality , even on the clearest of days . Everything seems oversized : wide , empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches across four city blocks , skyscrapers whose tops disappear in the haze . Even the policemen 's uniforms are baggy and loose , as if they were children playing dress-up in their parents ' clothes . All around you are things for sale-Nikes , North Face jackets , Tissot watches , new movies on VCD-and only when you move closer can you see the badly photocopied labels peeling off , the zippers hanging loose , the image blurred on the package . If you stop anywhere for too long , somebody will push you from behind and snap a few harsh syllables you recognize , but only barely . I studied Mandarin in school , and speak it quite well , but still I always remember what my mother used to say , that she could never trust anyone whose voice reminded her of a squeaking rodent , a rat caught in a trap . <p> All through that first taxi ride I kept my face close to the window , ignoring the conversation , trying to absorb everything I saw . Buildings made of white tile , the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman in a soldier 's uniform riding a bicycle , her daughter balanced precariously on the crossbar ; a man in an ill-fitting suit and loafers , shoveling coal into a wicker basket . Little Brother standing on a sidewalk , smoking cigarette after cigarette , and arguing with the shop owner in fractured Cantonese . It did no good : all the parts had already been sold . I remember looking at my watch and realizing that four hours had already gone by , and thinking that when we arrived back at the border it would feel as if no time had passed at all . <p> I tell you what , Little Brother said at some point . Let 's not make this trip a total failure . I 'll take you guys to Club Nikko . It 's in the Radisson-we can walk to the border from there . <p> There 's a Radisson here ? <p> Of course , he said impatiently . This is Shenzhen . They have everything . <p> Later I used to tease Lin about how she looked , the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knee-high boots , and a Lwenbru hat , a living commercial . She was a bargirl , who swooped down on tables before the waitress arrived , gave out free lighters and coasters , and offered Lwenbru at a " special price , " and she was terrible at it . Her voice was high-pitched and squeaked with nervousness , and she mangled the Cantonese tones ; the customers ' laughter sent her bouncing from table to table like a pinball . Little Brother was telling a long story about the first time he visited the Guangzhou racetrack , and eventually I lost the thread of it , and leaned back from the table . By that time it was late , and no new customers were coming in ; she was standing against the wall in back , by the bathroom door , and even across that darkened room I could see her cheeks burning . <p> Going to the toilet , I said , setting down my beer . Siu Wong , sitting next to me , slapped me on the back . As I passed I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mascara were beginning to run from the corners of her eyes . <p> Here , take this , I said abruptly , taking a packet of Kleenex from my jacket and thrusting it at her . She accepted it silently . I went into the bathroom , used the toilet , and washed my hands several times over . When I looked into the mirror , my own face was red . <p> Thanks , she said , as soon as I opened the door , and handed me back the packet of tissues . Where she had wiped around her eyes was now blue-black , and she looked like a panda bear . I feel better now . Everything 's okay . <p> It 's not your fault , I said , awkwardly , trying to remember the Mandarin words . It is n't your language . Maybe next time try a bar without so many Hong Kong people . <p> Hong Kong people tip . <p> I must have looked bewildered , because she laughed in my face , with a harsh sound . Ai ya , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Have n't you ever been to China before ? <p> Never . <p> Well , let me tell you something you do n't know . I have a college degree . You wo n't catch me working in some bar for lowlifes . This is good money . <p> What was your degree ? <p> Primary school education . <p> She crossed her arms and turned her head away , glancing at me sideways . She 's waiting for me to laugh , I realized , and pursed my lips and nodded , as if it were the most normal thing in the world . You could n't find a teaching job here ? I asked . <p> Are you crazy ? A country girl like me , from Anhui ? <p> Maybe I can help . I took a business card from my wallet and gave it to her , and she accepted it formally , with both hands . I have some friends who work in Shenzhen , I said . Maybe they could find you something better . Have you ever worked as a secretary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card , her lips moving silently . Hah vay , she said . That 's your name ? <p> It 's pronounced Harvey . <p> Well , listen , Harvey , she said , turning to face me , her arms still crossed . I wo n't embarrass you by giving your card back in front of your friends , but I 'm not interested in your kind of help . <p> But I was just <p> Are you deaf ? Leave me alone ! <p> When I returned to the table , Little Brother had already told them the punchline , and everyone was reeling with laughter , clinking their bottles for another round . Siu Wong leaned over to my ear . <p> You can do much better than that , he said . Why play around in the trash ? Just ask Little Brother to take you to second Wives Village sometime . <p> It was all I could do not to turn and smack him across the face . <p> I do n't think I was as nave as I must have seemed to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border on " business trips , " and how many Chinese women stay in Shenzhen for years , waiting to be allowed into Hong Kong to join men they think are their husbands . But I 'm not the kind of person to connect a face with something I saw on the TV news . And I 'd never imagined that someone could look at me that way : as a predator , a slippery eel , as Hong Kong people say . For weeks I thought about her , rewording our conversation over and over , wondering if I could have done anything differently . <p> I was out sailing the first time she called . When I returned to my locker and checked my pager there was a strange , garbled message : Club Nikko girl returning best time before 20:00 , and a Shenzhen telephone number . When I called , I could barely hear her voice over the blaring music and strange banging sounds in the background . <p> Where are you ? <p> Never mind , she said . I want to meet you again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four on Friday . <p> I thought you would throw away the card . After what you said . <p> I think I might have made a mistake , she said . Did I ? <p> Of course you did . <p> Just so you know , she said , I do n't expect anything from you . And you should n't , either . We 're starting off equal . <p> What do you mean ? <p> You 'll see , she said . see you there . And she hung up . <p> I 'd only been to the Shangri-La in Hong Kong once , for an awards ceremony , but as I remembered it , the one in Shenzhen was an exact copy : chandeliers , marble , lots of mirrors , and thick carpet that swallowed the sound of your footsteps . Fancy hotels make me nervous ; I always avoid them if I can . Being in one of those places makes me feel like someone has handed me something fragile-a glass bowl , an antique vase-and wo n't let me put it down . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby , drinking coffee . I 'd wondered if I would recognize her again , without the clothes , but even through the outside windows I picked her out immediately . Her hair was piled into a tight bun , and she was wearing a dark green jacket ; even without the makeup her skin was as white as chalk . Nothing she did suggested she was waiting for someone . Her eyes rested on the floor ; she brought the cup to her lips slowly , as if she had hours to finish it . I 'd never met anyone so beautiful in that way , so severe and composed and selfcontained . <p> When I walked up to her , she barely smiled . <p> I 'm sorry about the phone call , she said . It was a bad line . I could n't talk long . <p> It 's all right . As soon as I sat down , a waiter appeared . Coffee , I said . What she 's having . <p> Did it take you long to get here ? <p> No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Tai Wo . <p> She nodded politely . She has no idea where that is , I thought . Do n't be rude . I feel awkward about this , I said . I do n't even know your name . <p> Bai Ming is my name , she said . But everyone calls me Lin . <p> Like Lin in the book , right ? <p> She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head . <p> Lin Dai-yu , I said . From Dream of the Red Chamber ? <p> Lin was my elder sister , she whispered . She died when I was twelve . <p> I took a sip of coffee and looked around the lobby ; in various mirrors I could see ten different reflections of our two heads , together , from a distance . As if we were man and wife , or brother and sister , or a boss and his secretary ; as if there were one good reason for us to be sitting at the same table . <p> I did n't mean to embarrass you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure I understand why you asked me to come here . Did you want to find out about a job ? <p> I wanted to talk , she said . I 've never met anyone from Hong Kong before-just an ordinary person , I mean . I thought maybe that 's what you were . <p> What do you mean by ordinary ? <p> A person who does n't want something . <p> I do n't think I qualify for that , I said . Everybody wants something . It just happens that I do n't come to China looking for it . <p> She stared at me for so long I shifted in my chair . <p> What is it that you want ? <p> I shrugged . The same as everybody , I guess . Good fortune . More money . An apartment on the beach . A car . Good health . A family of my own . <p> You are n't married ? <p> Does that surprise you ? Do I seem married ? <p> No , she said . I did n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . <p> I smiled . My parents are dead , I said . So no one 's banging on my door asking for grandsons . <p> She looked down at her hands . Close-up her skin seemed thin and almost transparent , like rice paper ; there were faint bluish shadows underneath her cheekbones . Does she not eat ? I wondered . Or not go out in the sun ? <p> So now we know one another 's secrets , I said , and laughed , or tried to ; it sounded more like coughing . That 's a good way to begin , is n't it ? We ca n't make any worse fools of ourselves . <p> You can leave , she said quickly . If you want to . Do n't feel obligated to stay . <p> Not at all , I said . But I have a question for you . Why did you want to meet here ? Is n't there someplace less formal ? <p> I come here all the time , she said . It 's quiet . It 's clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in . The waiters all know me-I used to work in the bar downstairs . They do n't care if I sit here for hours . <p> It seems very lonely to me . <p> That depends on how you look at it . I think it 's peaceful . <p> I put down my cup and studied her face , as if for the first time . To me the word peace , the word ningjing , has a very specific , private meaning : it means the sound of the sea , of waves slapping against the board underneath me , and the feeling of crossing the bay on a stormy day when no other boats are out , and the water is the color of slate , and I 'm all alone underneath a ceiling of clouds . Hong Kong people do n't use this word very often , and when they do , you get the feeling they do n't know what they 're talking about . <p> I suppose you spend all of your free time in karaoke bars , she said . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about . It 's exactly the opposite . Do you know what windsurfing is ? She shook her head . I 'll show you , I said , reaching for a napkin . Do you have a pen ? <p> So I drew her a picture of a sailboard , and explained a little bit of how it 's done , the way you stand and hold the boom and tilt the sail to turn , the way you feel the wind 's changes on your shoulders and calves and the back of your head . While I was talking , her eyes began to flash a little , and she started asking questions . Why do n't you fall over ? What do you do if the wind dies ? She laughed and shook her head with exasperation , as if she could n't quite believe my answers . By that time it was almost five , and we both had to leave ; when she asked me if I wanted to meet again I said yes , automatically , and then thought , This is the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to anyone . <p> For the next month we met once every week , on Saturday afternoons , always at the Shangri-La . Once afterwards we went down the street to a Shanghai restaurant and ate lion's-head meatballs and Shaoxing pork . I always asked for the check ; outside , so as not to embarrass me , she paid me for her half , in old two-yuan bills so soft they fell through my fingers and fluttered to the sidewalk . When I protested , the crinkles of laughter disappeared from the corners of her eyes , and she gave me a cold smile . If you want to see me , she said , you 'll let me pay my share . <p> But it 's ridiculous , I said . They wo n't even take these at the exchange window , do you know that ? <p> She stooped and picked up the bills , bending her knees to one side , and stuffed them into my vest pocket . Keep them as a souvenir , she said . They 're not so little to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I would be the first to admit I 'm no expert on love . Before Lin , I 'd had other girlfriends , but really only by accident , and never for longer than a few months . A secretary in another division of my company , after we met at an office party . A friend of Siu Wong 's little sister , who asked me to help her with some accounting problems . Every one of these relationships ended with some variation of the same phrase : You 're a nice man , but I do n't think this should go any further . This is n't love . And it was true , of course : I did n't feel anything special for any of them , not even during sex , not even at the moment of orgasm . The whole performance to me was so physical , so lacking in personal feeling , that I always felt a little embarrassed afterward and wished she would simply leave . After a few encounters this embarrassment became so strong that I could n't even hold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with little protest from either of us . <p> There was a time in my mid-twenties when I wondered if I was gay , or asexual , if I would be happier as a lifelong celibate or a monk . I even considered going to a psychologist to see if there was something hidden in my past keeping me from being able to love . But I never went through with it . The sad truth is that it did n't bother me all that much . I had my friends ; I had my health and strength ; and I had the ocean , the waves and the wind-the one deep love of my life , you could say . You might say I decided to let fate choose for me . Probably , I thought , I would wind up married , and a father . But not by my own efforts , not by forcing the matter . <p> I never once considered the danger of this kind of passivity . I never thought that love would come out of the sky when I least expected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would have no choice but to bow down and face it , unprepared . <p> In all that time I never mentioned Lin to anyone . When my friends at the club asked where I was on Saturdays , I told them I was busy with an extra project at work ; if Siu Wong called , I said I was too tired to go out . It was n't simply a matter of embarrassment . Every time I imagined what I would say-She 's very nice , smart , she has a college degree , she 's really a teacher-my stomach rolled up into a tight little ball . Even so , I heard Siu Wong saying , what are you going to do next , live in Shenzhen ? She does n't have any connections-she ca n't leave . Do you think you can just become Chinese ? <p> That was the real question , of course . In Lin 's eyes I was a nice man who wore track suits all the time and made silly jokes in bad Mandarin : all the rest of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to her like shadows in a puppet show . And to me she was even more perplexing . Her parents were engineers who worked in a state-owned garment factory that made uniforms for the army . During the Cultural Revolution they were sent to the far west , to Gansu , and worked digging stones in a quarry ; she was born there , in a mud hut with no running water . What could I ever say about that ? All I knew about the Cultural Revolution was from movies . <p> In the end I did the only thing I could think of : I brought her the first volume of Dream of the Red Chamber . In the book Lin Dai-yu is the hero 's true love , a beautiful , ethereal orphan whom he is forbidden to marry , because of her poor and inauspicious background . Eventually he is convinced to marry her rival , and she falls ill and dies of grief , but that was irrelevant to me ; the first part of the novel is filled with the hero 's dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to her on a Saturday in March , and the next week it was sitting on the table by her elbow , wrinkled and dog-eared , when I came in . <p> Have you finished it already ? <p> Finished it ? Her eyes were puffy , I noticed , as if she had n't slept , and had n't bothered with makeup . I read it twice , she said . I think I do n't understand you . <p> Did n't you like it ? <p> Harvey , she said , she 's an orphan . She lives far away from her hometown and she knows she 'll probably never see the South again . All around her there are fabulously rich people , but she has no money of her own . How did you think it would make me feel ? <p> It 's a novel , I said . Not an essay on society . It 's a love story . <p> She pushed it across the table , and it fell into my lap . Keep your novels , she said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands : the lamination peeling from the cover , the spine folded and broken . Lin , I said , tell me what you want . <p> She gave me a suspicious look . You mean right now ? <p> In the future . Tell me what you want the most . <p> She stared down at her hands . <p> Or else I do n't know why I should keep coming here , I said . What good are we to each other ? You seem to think that I ca n't understand you , no matter how hard I try . <p> It 's ridiculous , she said . You 'll laugh at me . <p> The waiter brought our cups of coffee ; I took a sip immediately , and burned my tongue . Go on , I said , wincing . <p> I want to have a kindergarten . She bit down on her lower lip , scraping it with her teeth . Not work in one . I 've done that . I want to have a private kindergarten , like they do in Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have enough blankets and cots and chairs for every student . You can do painting and music and teach English . And you can get your own cook and have decent food . Only a certain number of students admitted every year . <p> There 's nothing ridiculous about that , I said . How much would it cost ? <p> She looked down at the table , a flush rising from her neck . <p> It 's impossible . They would n't let me change my residency . And I would have to buy a new teacher 's permit-if they would even sell me one . <p> Are you sure of that ? I wanted to ask , but something stopped me-the way her shoulders seemed to go limp , or the bright spots on her cheeks . Thank you , I said . I 'm glad you told me that . <p> Why ? <p> Because I do n't want to leave you . <p> She furrowed her eyebrows ; for a moment I thought she had n't understood me . <p> We ca n't talk this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think we have to , I said . I do n't think we can go on this way much longer . <p> You do n't understand , she said . There 's no other way . There are n't options . <p> Maybe we should go someplace where we can talk alone . <p> I live in a dormitory , she said . It 's a women-only building . If anyone saw me with you I would be evicted overnight . <p> Then maybe we should- <p> Go to a hotel room ? <p> I do n't want to be vulgar , I said . I just want to spend more time with you . <p> There are places , she said , pressing her lips into a line . But you have to pay by the hour . And sometimes they do n't clean the sheets in between . <p> Fine . Then I 'll spend the night in a hotel , and we 'll go out together for dim sum in the morning . <p> She shook her head . Understand this , she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in Shenzhen , if you pretend to be a whore , you are a whore . And I wo n't do that . Not even for a second . <p> You do n't have to , I said , tightening my fists under the table . It wo n't come to that . <p> It took me two weeks to find a solution . When I first told Little Brother what I wanted , he laughed so hard I took the phone away from my ear , and shouted at him to be quiet and get serious . Two days later , he faxed me a list of flats in Shenzhen that could be rented by the night , the week , or the month , no names taken , and no questions asked . <p> Do n't you have any friends in Shenzhen ? I asked him the next day . I 'm looking for a-a more personal arrangement . <p> What does that mean ? <p> I do n't want to pay , I said . Not directly . Maybe you could give him a gift , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have to give money directly . I made a promise . <p> You are a strange one , he said . What kind of girl is this ? <p> She 's very principled . <p> And you 're going behind her back ? <p> There 's no other way . I 'm not happy about it . <p> Whatever you say , flying fish , he said . All that salt water finally went to your head . I 'll find you something . <p> When I told Lin about it , at first she refused . You 're missing the point , she said . I told you already . If you pay for this , you might as well pay for everything . I wo n't belong to anyone , do n't you see ? <p> I 'm not paying anyone anything , I said . Someone 's doing me a favor . There 's no money involved . <p> But it 's yours . It 's your friend . It 's your power to say yes or no . <p> Then you decide , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come or not . <p> That was how I came to stay at the apartment on Nanhai Lu . It was in a new building , painted white , at the end of a little strip of land that jutted into Shenzhen Bay . The rest of the strip was taken up by a hotel development that had been abandoned , leaving only concrete foundations and rusted metal prongs jutting into the sky . The apartment was on the fourth floor , and the bedroom windows faced the water ; there were times when I woke up there and gazed out across the bay , forgetting where I was . <p> Sometimes Lin came on Saturday afternoons , left in the evening for work , and did n't return ; but most weekends she came briefly on Saturday and all day Sunday . I took things as slowly as I knew how : we watched movies on the VCD player , played guessfingers and Go , and listened to our favorite CDs , Chopin and Faye Wong and Kenny G. She taught me how to steam a whole fish with sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk tea . <p> It sounds ridiculous to say so-especially now-but I think of those days as some of the happiest of my life . When the door closed , Lin became a different person . She took long showers , filling the apartment with steam , and came out of the bathroom barefoot , wearing a Polo sweatsuit I had bought for her at the border . The apartment had a set of two plastic-covered couches in the living room ; she liked to lie back on one and prop her legs up on the other with her eyes closed . This reminds me of home , she said . Room to stretch out . No one watching you all the time . <p> Take off the plastic , I told her once . The landlord wo n't mind . It 's supposed to come off . <p> Plastic is fine . She slapped the cushion for emphasis . It 's dean . It does n't get wet . It does n't mildew . <p> But it 's uncomfortable . Your legs stick to it . <p> Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting off , as she often did ; some Sundays she would nap for two hours in the middle of the morning . You know , Harvey , she said , her voice wavering with sleepiness , you 're too kind . You 're too good a person for this world . You should be more sensible . <p> I 'm not so kind to everyone , I said . Only to you . <p> That 's what I mean . I 'm not such a wonderful person . I do n't deserve it . <p> I do n't believe that . <p> Do you know how I got to Shenzhen ? She sat up , wiping her mouth on her sleeve , and curled her legs under her . Have I ever told you this story ? <p> No . <p> I bribed a transit commissioner in Zhengzhou , she said . To get a residence permit . He wanted two cases of Marlboros and a bottle of Suntory whiskey . I got fake cigarettes from a guy I knew in my college . The whiskey was the hard part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one small bottle . <p> It 's an unfair system . Why should you feel bad about that ? <p> Not about that , she said . He was a huge , fat man , you know , so fat he could hardly fit behind his desk . His head looked like a balloon , it was perfectly round . And he had a mustache that only grew black on one side . When I gave him the cigarettes he opened the carton and started smoking one after another , at the same time he was filling out my form . He left these oily fingerprints all over it . And then , two weeks later , I heard he had a heart attack . Just fell over at his desk . And when I heard about it , I just started to laugh . I could see it so clearly . He was sucking those cigarettes so hard I thought he might keel over when I was there . <p> She giggled a little , and covered her mouth , but not so much that I could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do I deserve your kindness , Harvey ? A man dies and all I can do is laugh . <p> Lin , I said , I do n't blame you . If I were in your place I would have felt the same way . <p> But you were n't , she said . You 've never had to do anything like that . Why should you have to sympathize with me ? I 've never been able to understand that . I 'm not so special . Why do you have to go to all this trouble ? <p> Maybe because you do n't want me to , I said . I had meant it to be playful , but as soon as the words came out of my mouth , I realized it was the truth . You 've had so much unhappiness in your life , I said . I do n't blame you for doubting me . But I want to understand . Does n't that count for something ? <p> She shook her head . You ca n't , she said . It 's pointless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? <p> Tell me to leave , if you want , I said . I felt suddenly angry ; all the warmth had drained out of her face in an instant , as if she had willed it to . We 're not as different as you think , I said . My parents are gone . I know what it 's like to wake up and not know whether I 'd rather be dead or alive . Do n't tell me that just because I have money I 've never suffered . <p> Stay , she said . She reached up and motioned for me to come to her . I sat down on the couch , and she leaned over and rested her head carefully on my shoulder . Let 's not talk , she said . Talking just reminds me that I have to leave . <p> But otherwise we 'll just be strangers . <p> We 're strangers anyway , I expected her to say . She put her hand on my elbow , as if to keep me there . In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized she was asleep . <p> Each time she came we kissed only once , just before she left , and over the weeks the kisses became longer and longer , until she dropped her bag of work clothes and stood in the doorway with her arms around my shoulders , tears starting in her eyes . <p> You do n't have to go , I said . Tell them you were sick . <p> I 'm supposed to be saving money , she said . Instead I 'm spending it . If I do n't show up they 'll fire me then and there . In Shenzhen you do n't get second chances . <p> You can find something better , I said . You 're spending everything you make on taxis . It does n't make any sense , Lin . <p> I told you . I warned you that it would n't work . <p> Let me help you , then . <p> She pressed a finger to my lips . <p> My life is so little to you , she whispered . A snap of the fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Do you think that 's what I meant ? <p> She shook her head . You do n't have to mean it , she said . It just is . <p> It was Iune . In the evenings after she left , I went for walks along the concrete seawall that overlooked the bay , watching the sun melt through layers of haze . The water there was clotted with sewage and the shiny bellies of fish ; without wanting to , I imagined myself paddling through it on top of my sailboard , and felt a shiver of nausea and disgust . That is n't fair , I thought . There 's always garbage on the beach at Shek O. I turned to the east and looked up at the skyline , or what little of it I could see through the smog : a jumble of tall spires and cylinders and shining glass tower blocks , some of them copies of buildings in Hong Kong , others probably copied from buildings elsewhere in the world . Why is it that Shenzhen does n't look quite right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirage , as if I might come back next week and find it gone ? <p> We slept together for the first time on the night of July i , the first anniversary of the handover , of Hong Kong returning to China . From Nanhai Lu we could see the fireworks over downtown Shenzhen and over the Tsing Ma bridge in Hong Kong , and on satellite TV we watched the small crowds gathered in Statue Square , waving the new Hong Kong flag-the one with the purple flower , the bauhinnia . The joke is , I told her , that it 's a hybrid flower , and it 's sterile . Produces no offspring . But she did n't laugh . In the flickering light of the screen , her face was inert , unmoved ; nothing I did made her smile . <p> I 'm sorry , she said . I 'm just tired . <p> You need to look for another job . A day job . This work is n't right for you . <p> I do n't see what they 're celebrating , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a terrible year ? What about the stock market crash ? <p> They 're celebrating the future , then . Things will get better . <p> The future , she said . What a luxury . <p> I turned off the TV , and we sat slumped on the couch in the dark . <p> I 'm sorry . She touched my knee . I feel like I 've poisoned you . <p> We have to forget all this , I said . Ca n't we just be us , just once ? <p> She reached for my hand and squeezed it , hard . I want to , she said . Try to make me forget . <p> When it was over she folded herself against me , limp , like a body washed in by the tide . <p> I have an idea , I said , the next morning , bringing her a cup of tea in bed . I want you to hear me out . Will you listen ? <p> She nodded , brushing hair out of her eyes . <p> I 've been reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there 's no way to move you forward on the list for Hong Kong . And I ca n't legally change my residence to the mainland-even if you wanted me to . But there 's nothing to stop us from simultaneously emigrating to a third country . <p> But <p> I raised my hand . There are two options for us , I said . Canada and Australia . Both are expensive . I would have to sell my parents ' investments . And we would probably have to wait two or three years for you to get a visa . But that 's it-three years at the most . You could start a Chinese kindergarten in Toronto or Vancouver or Sydney . It would n't be so hard-I could help you . <p> You would do that ? Leave Hong Kong for good ? <p> Not necessarily for good . Once you 're naturalized in another country we can move back to Hong Kong if we want to . We 'll keep my apartment and rent it out . <p> She drank her tea in one gulp and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Have n't you . <p> It 's not so difficult . People do it all the time . <p> Of course , she said . People buy wives all the time . <p> Her eyes were bloodshot , and there was a streak of rouge smeared across her nose . And I felt I could n't tolerate her stubbornness for a moment longer . It seemed perverse , even artificial , and I felt myself getting angry , a rim of hot sweat around my lips . <p> The rest of the world is n't Shenzhen , I said . You do n't have to see it that way . We do n't have to see it that way . Once you 've left China everything will be different . <p> She gave a small cry , like a cat when you step on its paw , and reached over and slapped me across the face . Do n't tell me about the rest of the world ! she shouted . Do n't tell me what you can do for me . Is that what love is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up , winding the sheet around her . No more , she said . I 'm almost out of money . I have to move out of my room . <p> You did n't tell me that . <p> I 'm getting rid of my mobile , she said . I 'm leaving my job . <p> What will you do ? <p> Do n't ask me that question . <p> Lin , I said , do n't I deserve an answer ? <p> She turned to the window , covering her face with her hands , the sheet sagging around her ankles . You should forget about me , she said hoarsely , her voice muffled in her palms . I warned you . You should never have expected anything from me . <p> I do n't believe you , I said . I know what you want . You only have to be brave and want it enough . <p> She took a corner of the sheet and wrapped it again around her chest , and blew her nose with her fingers , the way farmers do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You still do n't understand . <p> I blinked my eyes once , twice ; the room seemed to bend around me , like a reflection in one of those funny mirrors at Ocean Park . Lin , I said , it does n't matter who has the money and who does n't . If I were in your position <p> If I lived in Hong Kong , you would never have noticed me , she said , turning from the window . You would n't have looked at me twice . Is n't that true ? <p> No , I said , but I felt a sagging weight in my chest , as if I had swallowed a stone . Of course it was true . I saw myself again in the dark back corner of the Club Nikko , handing her a packet of tissues , a business card-when would I have done that , in my normal life , with a stranger ? It is n't important , I wanted to say . How can it be so important ? But the words would n't form on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen it : my eyebrows tilted in concern , my mouth slowly forming the syllables , as if I were talking to a child . I had n't meant to sound that way , I thought . But how else could she have heard it ? <p> Pity is n't love , she said , her voice dropping to a whisper . It does n't turn into love . Maybe I thought it could , but I was wrong . I 'm sorry if I deceived you . <p> This ca n't be the end , I said weakly . I sat down on the edge of the bed , steadying myself with my hands ; the floor seemed to fall away from me , curving into the trough of a wave . For a moment I thought I would be sick . You are making a terrible mistake , I wanted to shout . You 'll always regret this . But I knew how she would respond . I made that mistake already . <p> I think you 're lying to me , I shouted at her suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I only felt my shoulders clenched together , as if I were expecting the ceiling to fall . You 're not really out of a job , are you ? You 're just sick of me and you want someone else . It 's a convenient excuse , is n't it ? <p> She turned and stared at me , and a shiver of recognition ran down her body : as if I had confirmed something she had always known . I 'm going home , she said . Back to Anhui . Maybe I 'll get a job . Probably not . I do n't care if I have to eat rice out of a hole in the ground . At least I wo n't be one of those women who sits in a villa and waits for a man , like a wind-up toy . I may go crazy , but not that way . <p> We took a taxi together from Nanhai Lu into the city , and at a street corner , just blocks away from the border , she told the driver to stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the driver shouted . Pay your fare ! <p> It 's all right , I said . I 'm paying for both of us . <p> As I walked to the border terminal , the clouds were beginning to break up , and the sidewalks glowed in the glaring sun . Twenty minutes later , when the train pulled out of the station on the Hong Kong side , I rested my forehead against the cool glass of the window and closed my eyes . I knew exactly how I wanted to remember her : sitting on the plastic couch , her feet propped up , her hair still wet from the shower , laughing at some inane romantic comedy on the TV . I strained to fix the image in my mind , but already it was difficult to recall the details : what did she do with her hands ? How did her voice sound when she spoke my name ? <p> If I disappear , that 's it , she had said . China will swallow me up . <p> Finally I gave up and opened my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border into Hong Kong , after you pass the small town of Sheung Shui , the countryside opens up into a lush valley , a lowland forest dotted with small farms that climb the sides of gently sloping hills . This is the valley of Fanling . In all my trips past this place , I had never seen what I was passing : a hundred shades of green so rich and deep that it hurt my eyes to look at them . In the colonial days , I read once , the English governors and magistrates had huge estates in Fanling , and they played a game where they released a fox and then chased after it with horses and a pack of dogs . All the animals had to be imported from England-even the fox ! But it was worth it to them , because it was the same game that they played at home in England , and they wanted to forget for a morning that they were here , instead of there . I wondered what it would feel like to ride a horse through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it , and whether one of those Englishmen might have slowed his horse for a moment , and breathed the air , and felt in that instant that he belonged here , on the other side of the world from where he was born . I raised my head from the window , and the faces of the other passengers dissolved , as if I were looking at them from underwater ; and I whispered to myself , Peace , peace , peace . <p>
