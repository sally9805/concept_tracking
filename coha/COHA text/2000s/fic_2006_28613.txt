The Echo Maker A Novel By Richard Powers Farrar , Straus and Giroux , LLC Richard Powers Cranes keep landing as night falls . Ribbons of them roll down , slack against the sky . They float in from all compass points , in kettles of a dozen , dropping with the dusk . Scores of Grus canadensis settle on the thawing river . They gather on the island flats , grazing , beating their wings , trumpeting : the advance wave of a mass evacuation . More birds land by the minute , the air red with calls . A neck stretches long ; legs drape behind . Wings curl forward , the length of a man . Spread like fingers , primaries tip the bird into the wind 's plane . The blood-red head bows and the wings sweep together , a cloaked priest giving benediction . Tail cups and belly buckles , surprised by the upsurge of ground . Legs kick out , their backward knees flapping like broken landing gear . Another bird plummets and stumbles forward , fighting for a spot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and wide enough to pass as safe . Twilight comes early , as it will for a few more weeks . The sky , ice blue through the encroaching willows and cottonwoods , flares up , a brief rose , before collapsing to indigo . Late February on the Platte , and the night 's chill haze hangs over this river , frosting the stubble from last fall that still fills the bordering fields . The nervousbirds , tall as children , crowd together wing by wing on this stretch of river , one that they 've learned to find by memory . They converge on the river at winter 's end as they have for eons , carpeting the wetlands . In this light , something saurian still clings to them : the oldest flying things on earth , one stutter-step away from pterodactyls . As darkness falls for real , it 's a beginner 's world again , the same evening as that day sixty million years ago when this migration began . Half a million birds-four-fifths of all the sandhill cranes on earth-home in on this river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the continent . They push up from New Mexico , Texas , and Mexico , hundreds of miles each day , with thousands more ahead before they reach their remembered nests . For a few weeks , this stretch of river shelters the miles-long flock . Then , by the start of spring , they 'll rise and head away , feeling their way up to Sas-katchewan , Alaska , or beyond . This year 's flight has always been . Something in the birds retraces a route laid down centuries before their parents showed it to them . And each crane recalls the route still to come . Tonight 's cranes mill again on the braided water . For another hour , their massed calls carry on the emptying air . The birds flap and fidget , edgy with migration . Some tear up frosty twigs and toss them in the air . Their jitters spill over into combat . At last the sandhills settle down into wary , stilt-legged sleep , most standing in the water , a few farther up in the stubbled fields . A squeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one broken scream and then another rouse the flock . The truck arcs through the air , corkscrewing into the field . A plume shoots through the birds . They lurch off the ground , wings beating . The panicked carpet lifts , circles , and falls again . Calls that seem to come from creatures twice their size carry miles before fading . By morning , that sound never happened . Again there is only here , now , the river 's braid , a feast of waste grain that will carry these flocks north , beyond the Arctic Circle . As first light breaks , the fossils return to life , testing their legs , tasting the frozen air , leaping free , bills skyward and throats open . And then , as if the night took nothing , forgetting everything but this moment , the dawn sandhills start to dance . Dance as they have since before this river started . Her brother needed her . The thought protected Karin through the alien night . She drove in a trance , keeping to the long dogleg , south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tracking the Platte . The back roads were impossible , in her condition . Still shattered from the telephone 's stab at two a.m. : Karin Schluter ? This is Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney . Your brother has had an accident . The aide would n't say anything over the phone . Just that Mark had flipped over on the shoulder of North Line Road and had lain pinned in his cab , almost frozen by the time the paramedics found and freed him . For a long time after hanging up , she could n't feel her fingers until she found them pressed into her cheeks . Her face was numb , as if she had been the one lying out there , in the freezing February night . Her hands , stiff and blue , clawed the wheel as she slipped through the reservations . First the Winnebago , then the rolling Omaha . The scrub trees along the patchy road bowed under tufts of snow . Winnebago Junction , the Pow Wow grounds , the tribal court and volunteer fire department , the station where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Native Arts Gift Shop , " the high school-Home of the Indians-where she 'd volunteer-tutored until despair drove her off : the scene turned away from her , hostile . On the long , empty stretch east of Rosalie , a lone male her brother 's age in a too-light coat and hat-Go Big Red-tracked through the roadside drift . He turned and snarled as she passed , repelling the intrusion . The suture of the centerline drew her downward into the snowy black . It made no sense : Mark , a near-professional driver , rolling off an arrow-straight country road that was as familiar to him as breathing . Driving off the road , in central Nebraska-like falling off a wooden horse . She toyed with the date : 02/20/02 . Did it mean anything ? Her palms butted the wheel , and the car shook . Your brother has had an accident . In fact , he 'd long ago taken every wrong turn you could take in life , and from the wrong lane . Telephone calls coming in at awful hours , as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She used the radio to keep herself awake . She tuned in to a crackpot talk-radio show about the best way to protect your pets from water-borne terrorist poisonings . All the deranged , static voices in the dark seeped into her , whispering what she was : alone on a deserted road , half a mile from her own disaster . What a loving child Mark had been , staffing his earthworm hospital , selling his toys to stave off the farm foreclosure , throwing his eight-year-old body between their parents that hideous night nineteen years ago when Cappy took a loop of power cord to Joan . That was how she pictured her brother , as she fell headlong into the dark . The root of all his accidents : too caring by half . Outside Grand Island , two hundred miles down from Sioux , as the day broke and the sky went peach , she glimpsed the Platte . First light glinted off its muddy brown , calming her . Something caught her eye , bobbing pearl waves flecked with red . Even she thought highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread as far as the distant tree line . She 'd seen them every spring for more than thirty years , and still the dancing mass made her jerk the wheel , almost following her brother . He 'd waited until the birds returned to spin out . He 'd been a mess already , back in October , when she drove this same route for their mother 's wake . Camping out with his beef-packing friends in the ninth circle of Nintendo hell , starting in on the six-packs for liquid brunch , fully loaded by the time he headed in to work on the swing shift . Traditions to protect , Rabbit ; family honor . She had n't had the will then , to talk sense to him . He would n't have heard her , if she had . But he 'd made it through the winter , even pulled himself together a little . Only for this . Kearney rose up : the scattered outskirts , the newly extruded superstore strip , the fast-food grease trough along Second , the old main drag . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Familiarity filled her with a weird , inappropriate calm . Home . She found Good Samaritan the way the birds found the Platte . She spoke to the trauma doctor , working hard to follow him . He kept saying moderate severity , stable , and lucky . He looked young enough to have been out partying with Mark earlier that night . She wanted to ask to see his med school diploma . Instead she asked what " moderate severity " meant , and nodded politely at the opaque answer . She asked about " lucky , " and the trauma doctor explained : " Lucky to be alive . " Firemen had cut him out of his cab with an acetylene torch . He might have lain there all night , coffined against the windshield , freezing and bleeding to death , just off the shoulder of the country road , except for the anonymous call from a gas station on the edge of town . They let her into the unit to see him . A nurse tried to prepare her , but Karin heard nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitors . On the bed lay a lump of white wrapping . A face cradled inside the tangle of tubes , swollen and rainbowed , coated in abrasions . His bloody lips and cheeks were flecked with embedded gravel . The matted hair gave way to a patch of bare skull sprouting wires . The forehead had been pressed to a hot grill . In a flimsy robin's-egg gown , her brother struggled to inhale . She heard herself call him , from a distance . " Mark ? " The eyes opened at the sound , like the hard plastic eyes of her girlhood dolls . Nothing moved , not even his eyelids . Nothing , until his mouth pumped , without sound . She leaned down into the equipment . Air hissed through his lips , above the hum of the monitors . Wind through a field of ready wheat . His face knew her . But nothing came out of his mouth except a trickle of saliva . His eyes pleaded , terrified . He needed something from her , life or death . " It 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance only made him worse . She was exciting him , exactly what the nurses had forbidden . She looked away , anywhere but at his animal eyes . The room burned into her memory : the drawn curtain , the two racks of threatening electronic equipment , the lime sherbet-colored wall , the rolling table alongside his bed . She tried again . " Markie , it 's Karin . You 're going to be all right . " Saying it made a kind of truth . A groan escaped his sealed mouth . His hand , stuck with an IV tube , reached up and grabbed her wrist . His aim stunned her . The grip was feeble but deadly , drawing her down into the mesh of tubes . His fingers feathered at her , frantic , as if , in this split second , she might still keep his truck from wiping out . The nurse made her leave . Karin Schluter sat in the trauma waiting room , a glass terrarium at the end of a long corridor smelling of antiseptics , dread , and ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in dark sweatshirts and overalls , sat in the squared-off , padded apricot chairs alongside her . She figured them : Father heart attack ; husband hunting accident ; child overdose . Off in the corner , a muted television beamed images of a mountain wasteland scattered with guerrillas . Afghanistan , winter , 2002 . After a while , she noticed a thread of blood wicking down her right index finger , where she 'd bitten through her cuticle . She found herself rising and drifting to the restroom , where she vomited . Later , she ate , something warm and sticky from the hospital cafeteria . At one point , she stood in one of those half-finished stairwells of poured concrete meant to be seen only when the building was on fire , calling back to Sioux City , the massive computer and home electronics company where she worked in consumer relations . She stood smoothing her rumpled boucl skirt as if her supervisor could see her over the line . She told her boss , as vaguely as she could , about the accident . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths . She asked for two days off . He offered her three . She started to protest , but switched at once to grateful acceptance . Back in the waiting room , she witnessed eight middle-aged men in flannel standing in a ring , their slow eyes scanning the floor . A murmur issued from them , wind teasing the lonely screens of a farmhouse . The sound rose and fell in waves . It took her a moment to realize : a prayer circle , for another victim who 'd come in just after Mark . A makeshift Pentecostal service , covering anything that scal-pels , drugs , and lasers could n't . The gift of tongues descended on the circle of men , like small talk at a family reunion . Home was the place you never escape , even in nightmare . Stable . Lucky . The words got Karin through to midday . But when the trauma doctor next talked to her , the words had become cerebral edema . Something had spiked the pressure inside her brother 's skull . Nurses tried cooling his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luck and stability were gone . When they let her see Mark again , she no longer knew him . The person they took her to the second time lay comatose , his face collapsed into some stranger 's . His eyes would n't open when she called his name . His arms hung still , even when she squeezed them . Hospital personnel came to talk to her . They spoke to her as if she were brain-damaged . She pumped them for information . Mark 's blood alcohol content had been just under the Nebraska limit-three or four beers in the hours before rolling his truck . Nothing else noticeable in his system . His truck was destroyed . Two policemen took her aside in the corridor and asked her questions . She answered what she knew , which was nothing . An hour later , she wondered if she 'd imagined the conversation . Late that afternoon , a man of fifty in a blue work shirt sat down next to her where she waited . She managed to turn and blink . Not possible , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting room . " You should get a lawyer , " the man said . She blinked again and shook her head . Sleep deprivation . " You 're with the fellow who rolled his truck ? Read about him in the Telegraph . You should definitely get a lawyer . " Her head would not stop shaking . " Are you one ? " The man jerked back . " Good God , no . Just neighborly advice . " She hunted down the newspaper and read the flimsy accident account until it crumbled . She sat in the glass terrarium as long as she could , then circled the ward , then sat again . Every hour , she begged to see him . Each time , they denied her . She dozed for five minutes at a shot , propped in the sculpted apricot chair . Mark rose up in her dreams , like buffalo grass after a prairie fire . A child who , out of pity , always picked the worst players for his team . An adult who called only when weepy drunk . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the mirror in the floor 's bathroom : blotchy and teetering , her fall of red hair a tangled bead-curtain . But still presentable , given everything . " There has been some reversal , " the doctor explained . He spoke in B waves and millimeters of mercury , lobes and ventricles and hematomas . Karin finally understood . Mark would need surgery . They slit his throat and put a bolt into his skull . The nurses stopped answering Karin 's questions . Hours later , in her best consumer-relations voice , she asked again to see him . They said he was too weakened by the procedures . The nurses offered to get something for her , and Karin only slowly realized they meant medication . " Oh , no thanks , " she said . " I 'm good . " " Go home for a while , " the trauma doctor advised . " Doctor 's orders . You need some rest . " " Other people are sleeping on the floor of the waiting room . I can get a sleeping bag and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do right now , " the doctor claimed . But that could n't be ; not in the world she came from . She promised to go rest if they let her see Mark , just for a moment . They did . His eyes were still closed , and he responded to nothing . Then she saw the note . It lay on the bed stand , waiting . No one could tell her when it had appeared . Some messenger had slipped into the room unseen , even while Karin was shut out . The writing was spidery , ethereal : immigrant scrawl from a century ago . I am No One but Tonight on North Line Road GOD led me to you so You could Live and bring back someone else . A flock of birds , each one burning . Stars swoop down to bullets . Hot red specks take flesh , nest there , a body part , part body . Lasts forever : no change to measure . Flock of fiery cinders . When gray pain of them thins , then always water . Flattest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end but flow . Nextless stream , lowest thing above knowing . A thing itself the cold and so ca n't feel it . Body flat water , falling an inch a mile . Torso long as the world . Frozen run all the way from open to close . Great oxbows , age bends , lazy delayed S , switch current to still as long as possible the one long drop it already finishes . Not even river , not even wet brown slow west , no now or then except in now and then rising . Face forcing up into soundless scream . White column , lit in a river of light . Then pure terror , pealing into air , flipping and falling , anything but hit target . One sound gets not a word but still says : come . Come with . Try death . At last only water . Flat water spreading to its level . Water that is nothing but into nothing falls . ( Continues ... ) by Richard Powers             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
