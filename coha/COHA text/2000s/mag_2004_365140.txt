The phrase happy hour does n't usually imply healthy behavior . But there are new cocktails on the bar scene that , while not exactly health supplements , do use natural and vitamin-packed mixers . In New York City , Stone Rose boasts martinis made with a mix of Beefeater 's Wet gin and Glaceau Power-C Vitaminwater , while Sumile features the Eric Mason 50/50 , which combines vodka , yuzu lemonade and oolong tea . Atlanta 's Inman Park Patio has an herbal-green-tea martini . Koi in Los Angeles offers a cocktail with rice liquor , green tea ( again ) and Midori . And for the soy conscious , Fly Bar in San Francisco serves the 5-0  --  a mix of sake , soy milk and pineapple juice .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
