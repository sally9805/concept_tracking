NEW YORK  --  Jimmy Fallon could n't be prouder of his new sixth-floor digs . <p> NBC 's newest late-night gabber is almost bouncing in place , so eager is he to show off his brand-new set . Fallon greets a producer : " Hey , brother , it 's looking so good . Everything 's so amazing . " He points to a platform near where house band The Roots would be jamming . " It pulls out so they can play to the audience when they warm up , " he says . <p> The studio rug is made of plastic bottles , the floors of bamboo . The audience will perch in red velvet seats that once graced Radio City Music Hall . " We 're going green , as much as we can , " he says . <p> And like most gaming and gadget-loving males , Fallon stops and gazes reverently at his point of pride , perched near his desk . " It 's a 108-inch flat-screen . It 's a huge get . We made it all work . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ballyhooed debut as a late-night talk-show host  --  he takes over Conan O'Brien 's 12:30 a.m . ET/PT time slot starting Monday  --  Fallon is a mixture of tightly wound nervousness and giddy exuberance . <p> " I 'm having a hard time sleeping , but it 's all right . I have to figure it out . I 'm thinking of a lot of stuff . The idea is to have fun , or there 's no sense in doing it . <p> " I 'm ready to go tonight . I 've grown up since Saturday Night Live , but I like talking to people . " <p> At the same time , his attitude seems somewhat Zen . Eight months ago , he was announced as the replacement for O'Brien , who is moving west to replace Jay Leno as the host of The Tonight Show . " It felt like a long time , " Fallon says in an interview last week on his set at NBC 's 30 Rockefeller Plaza studios . " I was nervous and excited and anxious . Now , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stress . I do n't have a dressing room . Who cares ? One day I 'll have a dressing room . You just have to know it will happen and trust the people you 're working with . " <p> Some stiff competition <p> The late-night field now is unquestionably more crowded than a Prada sample sale . There 's middlebrow Leno at 10 , a surprise prime-time entry on NBC starting this fall , followed by O'Brien and Fallon . ABC has Jimmy Kimmel , a genial guy best known for his Ben Affleck video lovefest , at midnight . And CBS has the formidable , sardonic David Letterman , followed by cheeky Scottish import Craig Ferguson . <p> Though O'Brien 's farewell last Friday hit a two-year high in the ratings , Ferguson has been closing the gap overall with Late Night . In total viewers , O'Brien has averaged 1.98 million this season , Ferguson 1.92 million . And CBS will heavily promote Ferguson in prime-time on Fallon 's first day , airing spots with guest Paris Hilton during breaks in their top-rated lineup . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're all good shows . I did not see ( the Leno announcement ) coming . That was shocking . But I think that at 12:30 , either you 're awake or you 're not . I do n't think the 10 p.m. will affect me at all . If we can do decent ratings , hold on to Conan 's numbers , I 'll be happy . It 's a marathon , not a race . It 's a long , long thing if it 's going to work . " <p> What makes Fallon stand out , says producer Mike Shoemaker , is Fallon . " He 's actually interested . He has a funny point of view . He 's just a comfortable person to talk to , " says Shoemaker , who worked with him on Saturday Night Live . So far , in test-show tapings , " the guests seem at ease with him . It feels real . " <p> The vibe of Late Night With Jimmy Fallon seems more audience-friendly and laid-back than that of his peers . It 's " younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more interactive than shows have been in the past . Our show wo n't hide the fact that we know people are on the Internet all day . We 've hired three full-time bloggers . We 'll have short films and videos . I 'll be showing up . " <p> During his six years on SNL , Fallon co-anchored Weekend Update with Tina Fey as well as appearing as Wade , one of the members of the boy band 7 Degrees Celsius ; guitar player Seoor Guadalupe Ramirez ; and Barry Gibb . It was also during his Weekend Update stint that Fallon learned something that would come in handy for his new talk-show career : " I did n't know how to tie a tie . I was 25 years old or something . It was ridiculous . So ( a dresser ) taught me . " <p> Plus , it helped build his comfort level in front of the camera on live TV . " Weekend Update was always scripted , " Shoemaker says , " but those skills serve him well as far as learning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were helped by Update . " <p> Like most SNL cast members , Fallon left the show for a would-be film career . But when he departed , SNL producer Lorne Michaels told Fallon to keep his mind open about a possible late-night role later on . <p> " I was leaving SNL in 2004 , and Lorne said to me to keep in mind we 'd be looking for a replacement for Conan in 2009 . It sounded interesting , " Fallon says . " Tina was there and said it could be good . I decided to try movies and see that would work . " <p> As for movies , things did n't exactly go the Will Ferrell route for Fallon , who starred in such clunkers as 2004 's Taxi and 2005 's Fever Pitch . Fallon is matter-of-fact about his lack of luck . " I tried movies . I did two movies . They did n't do that well . That stopped after Fever Pitch . I did n't get asked to do more movies . " <p> Then , everything changed <p> But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrymore and produced by her Flower Films , that Fallon began dating Barrymore 's producing partner , Nancy Juvonen . " It was awesome , " he says . They were married in 2007 ; photos of his tanned , blond bride cover the walls of Fallon 's corner office . <p> As O'Brien was packing up to move west , Michaels was back on the phone . " ' They 're looking for a replacement . What do you think ? " Fallon says , recalling their conversation . " I asked Nancy , and she said , ' Of course you should do this . NBC had other people in mind . Lorne 's like , Jimmy 's my only choice . And that 's it . I began asking Lorne what to do , who we hire . " <p> To make sure he also had the funny in hand , Fallon returned to doing stand-up . " Every weekend I was out there , working on a new act . Now I 'm up to 55 minutes . It 's pretty good , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just gotten tired of my act that I wrote in my bedroom when I was in high school . It 's a different crowd every night . I missed being in front of an audience . You get an immediate response . It 's kind of great . " <p> Spiral staircase ? Check <p> From the start , Fallon says , he had a clear vision for his show , down to what his desk should look like . " I gave the set guy a three-page Word document . I got everything . I wanted the Radio City seats . I wanted rafters in the back that the kids can dance on . I wanted a spiral staircase because I love spiral staircases , so I got one of those . " <p> Shoemaker says next week 's show will be " ( everything ) we had in mind . I ca n't think of anything we wanted that we did n't get . It 's up to us to make those things work together . " <p> Now , Fallon is all staffed up . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff pumped , he took them to Atlantic City for a night on his own dime . He 's visibly anxious , but he 's also affable and clearly excited . <p> " The only pressure is on me . Can we do a good show ? The set is amazing . The band is amazing . If it works , it goes for years . People make a big deal about the first show , but I 'm barely concerned about that . They should talk about it a year from now . " <p> Fallon also will be competing with the other shows to book A-list celebrities and the perennial favorites of the talk-show circuit . Fallon says that a year from now , people wo n't remember who his first guest was , yet he easily recalls Letterman 's first guests : Tom Brokaw and Bill Murray . <p> Calling in a few favors <p> Still , he 's starting things off with a bang : Fallon 's first guests are Robert De Niro and Justin Timberlake . Later on , he 'll have Fey , Cameron Diaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors . You call in your friends , " he says . " I purposely did not want to book my friends that much . I want to learn how to interview people . I 'd rather know about someone I do n't know about . " <p> Still , his SNL people " are going to help me out , " Fallon says . <p> But actors aside , Fallon promises that many of his guests will be out of the mainstream . He says he 'll feature gadgets on the show and plans to treat the creator of a video game the same way another show would welcome a J.J. Abrams or Judd Apatow . " It 's a big audience out there . We 're not excluding people either . I really like music , so we can get everyone from Green Day to Trace Adkins . " <p> Though he 's all business discussing his show , there 's something inherently boyish and cheerful about Fallon . He jokes that in what is obviously his wedding photo , he 's kissing " my sister . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tied the knot , with his father holding a cigarette . And nearby is a photo of Fallon teeing off . " Guess where we were playing golf ? I 'll give you two guesses , " he says . " New Jersey . Bayonne , New Jersey . Is n't that awesome ? " <p> His office overlooks Radio City Music Hall . " I 've got the best office in the world . You can see people . It 's actually fun seeing humans and what they 're doing . " <p> Let 's hope they return the favor when he 's on air . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
