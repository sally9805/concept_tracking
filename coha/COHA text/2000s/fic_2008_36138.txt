PROLOGUE OCTOBER  --  IRAQ <p> Ragheads dragged the driver out of the vehicle and took him away , " the sergeant told the lieutenant , who was sitting in a Humvee . " They shot the woman in the car . She 's still in it . Iraqi grunt says she 's alive but the assholes put a bomb in the car . They 're using her as cheese in the trap . " <p> " Shit , " said the lieutenant and rubbed the stubble on his chin . <p> The day was hot , and the chatter of automatic weapons firing bursts was the musical background . The column of vehicles had ground to a halt in a cloud of dust , and since there was no wind , the dust sifted softly down , blanketing equipment and men and making breathing difficult . <p> U.S. Navy Petty Officer Third Class Owen Winchester moved closer to the lead vehicle so that he could hear the lieutenant and sergeant better . <p> He could see the back end of an old sedan with faded , peeling paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three Marines and three Iraqi soldiers were huddled in an irrigation ditch fifty feet to the right of the road . On the left was a block of houses . <p> " Let me go take a look , " Winchester said to the lieutenant . <p> " Listen , doc , " the sergeant said , glancing at Winchester . " The ragheads would love to do you same as they would us . " <p> " I want to take a look , " Winchester insisted . " If she can be saved ... " He left it hanging there as distant small-arms fire rattled randomly . <p> The place was a sun-baked hellhole ; it made Juarez look like Paris on the Rio Bravo . The tragedy was that real humans tried to live here ... and were murdered here by rats with guns who wanted to rule the dungheap in the name of a vengeful , merciless god , one who demanded human sacrifice as a ticket to Paradise . <p> The lieutenant had been in Iraq for six months and was approaching burnout . The wanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  he accepted it , just as he did the heat and dirt and human misery he saw everywhere he looked . He forced himself to think about the situation . A woman . Shot . She would probably die unless something was done . So what ? No , no , do n't think like that , he thought . That 's the way they think , which is why the Devil lives here . After a few seconds , he said , " Okay . Take a look . And watch your ass . " <p> The sergeant did n't say another word , merely began trotting ahead in that bent-over combat trot of soldiers the world over . With his firstaid bag over his shoulder , Winchester followed . <p> They flopped into the irrigation ditch directly opposite the car , where they could see into the passenger compartment . There was a woman in there , all right , slumped over . She was n't wearing a head scarf . They could see her dark hair . <p> Fifteen feet from them was the rotting carcass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was awe-inspiring . <p> An Iraqi soldier joined them . " She has been shot , " he said in heavily accented English . " Stomach . I get close , see her and bomb . " <p> " How are they going to detonate it , you think ? " Winchester asked , looking around , trying to spot the triggerman . He saw no one but the Iraqi soldiers and Marines lying on their stomachs in the irrigation ditch , away from the dog . The mud-walled and brick buildings across the way looked empty , abandoned , their windows blank and dark . <p> " Cell phone , most likely , " the sergeant said sourly . " From somewhere over there , in one of those apartments . Or a garage door opener . " <p> " Saving lives is my job , " the corpsman said . " I want to take a look . " <p> " You 're an idiot . " <p> " Probably . " Winchester grinned . He had a good grin . <p> " Jesus ! Do n't do nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears , Winchester ditched the first-aid bag and trotted toward the car . From ten feet away he could see the woman 's head slumped over , see that the door was ajar . He closed to five feet . <p> She was n't wearing a seat belt , and a bomb was lying on the driver 's seat . Looked like four sticks of dynamite , fused , with a black box taped to the bundle . The woman moved her head slightly , and he heard a low moan . <p> Winchester ran back to the ditch , holding his helmet in place , and flopped down beside the sergeant . <p> " There 's a bomb on the driver 's seat , " he told the sergeant , whose name was Joe Martinez . " And she 's still alive . I think I can get her out of there before they blow it . Takes time to dial a phone , time for the network to make the phone you called ring . Might be enough time . " <p> " Might be just enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The door is ajar and she is n't wearing a seat belt . I can do this . Open the door and grab her and run like hell . " <p> " You 're an idiot , " Sergeant Martinez repeated . <p> " Would you try it if she was your sister ? " <p> " She ai n't my sister , " the sergeant said with feeling as he scanned the buildings across the road . " What do they say ? No good deed goes unpunished ? " <p> " I will go , " the Iraqi soldier said . He laid his weapon on the edge of the ditch , began taking off his web belt . " Two men , one on each arm . " <p> " She 's my sister , Joe , " Owen Winchester said to Martinez . He grinned again , broadly . <p> The sergeant watched as Winchester and the Iraqi soldier took off all their gear and their helmets , so they could run faster . <p> " You fuckin ' swabbie ! You got balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ? " Martinez laid down his rifle , took off his web belt and tossed his helmet beside the rifle . " I 'll get the door . You two get her . " He took a deep breath and exhaled explosively . " Okay , on three . One , two , threeeee ! " <p> They vaulted from the ditch and sprinted toward the car . The sergeant jerked the door open . The other two men reached in , Winchester grabbing one arm and the Iraqi the other , and pulled the wounded woman from the car , then hooked an arm under each armpit . Joe Martinez picked up her feet , and they began to run . <p> They were ten feet from the car when the bomb exploded . <p> Excerpted from The Assassin by Stephen Coonts <p> Copyright 2008 by Stephen Coonts <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
