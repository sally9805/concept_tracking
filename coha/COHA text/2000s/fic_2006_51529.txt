Tony Sarowitz says , " It 's been nearly 25 years since I published my last story in F &SF; ( ' Dinosaurs on Broadway , " September 1981 ) . While life has taken me in other directions since then , my heart has never been far from science fiction , my first literary love . " A Daze in the Life " represents a rekindling of that old flame . " <p> SHE SLIPS INTO MY MIND in the middle of breakfast , all mischief and dark eyes , then vanishes in a wink . I set my coffee down untasted and make an effort to remember . She 'd been leaning back against a dirty yellow brick wall , knee cocked , cigarette in her lips , the match in her hands just starting to flare . For a moment I wonder if I 'd conjured her up out of memory and desire . But the details are too settled , the colors too vivid . You get to know the difference between a trace and imagination , subtle though it may be , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds , I catch another trace of her an hour or so later . It comes out of the blue as I stretch out on the sofa , half-listening to classic Miles , drifting through Sketches of Spain in just the right state of alert abstraction , as it happens , to notice each stray ping of data as it bursts from the subliminal buzz of the WiPsi data stream . Faces , formulae , fragments of analysis : each burn an instant against the curtain of music , then darken , dismissed , unremembered . Until she reappears . There must be low-res video in the feed this time because she moves in jittery black and white , tossing back her head , her lips flattening with ... what ? Impatience ? The clip lasts no more than a second , but my heart leaps as if the spring of her short black hair and the fluency of her expression reveal intimate secrets . I wonder how other moods might shape her face . I wonder what it would take to make her smile . I wonder why I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever seen . Attractive , yes , but with a fleshy sensuality and a scruffy , Red Hook sense of style . She smolders rather than sparkles , with a look that provokes rather than enchants . Not my type at all . Except that , apparently , she is . I know better than to say anything about her when I meet William for lunch . Unfortunately , William knows me better than to miss the signs . " Let me guess . " He presses his fingers to his forehead in mock concentration . " Another date with the girl of your dreams . " I feel myself redden . " I 'm just saying , we do n't usually see so many personal files in the data stream . " He throws back his head and laughs . Other diners glance our way . " I can read your mind , pal . " The Cloister is a typical Smith Street CAptive hangout : a tiny , run-down joint with mismatched silverware , butcher paper tablecloths , and food fabulous enough to justify the stratospheric prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensioned tonsure and faded designer jeans , the uniform of our overpaid , indolent tribe . Jan , the chef and co-owner , puts between us a bowl of fat , green-lipped mussels billowing clouds of winey , ambrosial steam . " Save me , Jan , " I plead . " He 's mocking my affections . " Jan tsks and rests her hand gently on my scalp . " Play nice , boys . Boa apptit . " I notice the cool absence of her hand on my head as she disappears back into the kitchen . " Flesh and blood has its advantages , " William mumbles molluskularly . " You should try it sometime . " He winks and spears another mussel , putting him two in the lead . The meal restores my spirits . I sling my jacket over my shoulder and saunter home , intoxicated with the warmth of the midday sun and my own well-fed well-being . I notice the trees budding along Smith Street , the yawning shop doors expelling perfumed breath . I 'm grinning like a goon as I turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digs in the tiny front garden , a tray of seedlings on the bricks beside him . He looks up as I take the stoop two steps at a time . " Looks like someone 's having a good day , " he says . My smile slips self-consciously . " Not too bad , " I say , pausing at the front door . " The usual . You ? " Mike is a freelance programmer who has n't worked for months . He 's a decent guy , a neighborhood old-timer who treats CAptives like regular people . Still , I do n't know how much longer he can last before he 's priced out of the Cobble Hill LAN , if not out of Brooklyn altogether . " Same old same old . " He waves and turns back to his planting . " Do n't let the headbugs bite . " I step inside , troubled by senseless guilt on Mike 's account . It 's a relief to settle the CApp onto my tonsure and feel the flow of data displace more disturbing undercurrents of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free to kick off my shoes and relax . I even consider dusting off my keyboard and trying to noodle out a tune . Just then , my head fills with the susurration of a security interdict , eliminating the possibility . At time-and-a-half I can hardly complain , but I wonder what secret could be so deep and dark that every trace of it must be blocked . Coded military communications ? The perfect egg salad recipe ? Orders from clandestine insect overlords ? All I know for sure is that , until it 's done , there 's no point trying to wring anything useful out of my brain . I switch from jazz to rock-and-roll , the better to Nautilus a sweat to . When every sinew screams for mercy , I flop on the couch and catch up on the latest episodes otHospiCop . The relentless shush in my head does n't let up until the CApp goes off-line at five o'clock . The sudden silence feels like a rush of cool water . I let it wash over me . The f irst thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shower . And a stiff drink . The usual suspects occupy the usual table when I step into the cavernous , blue-lit bowels of the Afterlife Bar . Bennie is spouting his latest conspiracy theory , oblivious to William 's tired , tolerant glaze and Sadly 's complete disinterest . Sadly stares at me with her great empty eyes . " Did you get anything worthwhile done today ? " she asks . I shake my head as I take a seat , wishing for the thousandth time I 'd never shown her my songs . " It 's all in the lyrics , " Bennie says . " ' He grabs his hat , then makes the bus in seconds flat . " " Hat " is obviously a metaphor for CApp . " Bus " is an archaic term for data interface . " I signal for the waitress . " What are we talking about ? " " You know the Beatles ? " Bennie asks . " Bennie is explaining how a fifty-year-olrfsong predicted CAptivity , " William says dryly . " Then there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what ? " He pauses rhetorically . " ' Turn you on . " Tell me that 's coincidence . " " I need a drink . " Looking futilely around for a waitress , I notice a woman standing by herself at the bar . William pries my fingers from his arm . " Easy , pal . " " That 's her ! " She stands there with her back to the bar like she owns the place , one foot up , knee jutting arrogantly forward , elbows leaning back on the brass rail , an expression on her face I interpret as unassailable boredom . Unless she keeps a closetful of identical outfits at home , she wears the same black boots , black denim jeans , and ratty black leather jacket I remember from this morning 's trace . I approach and stand beside her at the bar , stunned by the physicality of her presence , certain there is absolutely nothing I can say to her that wo n't provoke dismissal or , worse , disdain . So I say nothing and signal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table with nothing but beer and embarrassment . Then , miraculously , she speaks . " What 's it feel like ? " She has n't turned her head , hut there does n't appear to be anyone else she might be addressing . " Huh ? " I parry . " The head thingy , the hat , the cranial , what you call it , application ? " Her voice is pure New York , but she gives those awkward diphthongs a seductive twist . " Cerebral Appliance . CApp . " . " Does it hurt or feel , I do n't know , electric ? " " It does n't really feel like anything . No , wait , that 's not true . It 's like ... , " I pause , wheels spinning , searching for an image sharp enough to lend me a bit of traction . " .. . like a mist on a lake , or a f ogbank on a road . " " That does n't sound too bad , " she says . " I have friends who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . " " Except I 'm the one getting paid . " This earns a faint smile . " And that 's okay ? Letting them pay you to use your head that way ? " " As far as I 'm concerned , I 'm just renting out space . It 's like a motel room , - what they do in there is their business . " She laughs , and in that instant is transformed from sultry to incandescent . No , no , I 'm the one who is transformed . I 'm the one she illuminates , letting me see myself as the inspiration for her radiance . " Actually , " I continue , " I 'm thinking about ditching the whole deal , getting my head clear so I can get back to writing songs . " I have no idea where this is coming from , or what the next words careening out of my mouth might be . Helplessly , I babble on . " When you think about it , there 's something tragic about the whole CAptivity dynamic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sublimation of the individual into a soulless collective whole . " I 'm not even sure what this means . I recognize it though ; it 's straight Sadly , the very riff that earned her the nickname . This , apparently , is the best I can come up with to amuse the girl of my dreams . To my amazement , she does n't laugh in my face or turn dismissively away . In fact , she seems to take my nonsense at face value . " I did n't expect to hear that kind of talk from a data monk , " she says . " Paul . " I offer my hand . She squeezes it lightly . " Hello , Paul . Oona . " " Oona , " I say , testing it out . I like the sound . " Listen , would you like to come over to our table , join my friends for a drink ? " She hesitates . " It 's okay . I mean , there 's no ironclad rule against you sitting there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay over there while everybody else .... " She shakes her head . I brace myself for a brushoff . Instead , she peers at me as if reading something written against the lenses of my eyes . " Why do n't you come over to my table , " she says finally , and glides off through the crowd without looking to see if I follow . I do . I 've never seen a CAptive cross to this side of the room . The crowd parts awkwardly for me , some people moving too quickly out of my way , others slyly shifting their weight to make it harder for me to pass . Every small interaction seems subtly wrong . I lose track of her as she moves effortlessly through the throng . When I catch sight of her again , she 's leaning over to talk into the ear of an East Village Jesus with brown , shoulder-length hair , intense brown eyes , and a modest assortment of nostril rings and lip studs . I take a step back , feeling caught up in a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and smiles , which is all I need to overlook intimations of disaster . Jesus hooks his foot around the leg of a nearby chair and drags it over to his table . " I 'm told you 're an unusual man , " he says , gravelly voice complementing his aura of punked-out divinity . " I hope I 'm not intruding . " Their mutual body language hints at intimacy , but the evidence is inconclusive . Or is that just wishful thinking ? Oona pats the seat of the chair . I sit . " May I ? " she asks , reaching tentatively for my scalp . I tilt my head toward her . She strokes my tonsure lightly with her fingertips . I understand why cats purr . " Paul 's a songwriter , " she says . " Is n't that cool ? " " What kind of music are you into ? " I ask her . " What 's really cool , " Jesus intones , " Is a CAptive willing to question CAptivity . In fact , that 's more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a hard look . It 's one thing for members of the tribe to call each other CAptives , but another coming from outside . It scrapes a nerve . He returns my stare , unfazed , as if the absence of intent to offend excuses the offense . I do n't want to appear uncivil , not in her presence , so I shrug it off . " I was just talking off the top of my head , " I say . " So to speak . " " Did n't you mean it ? " Oona asks , withdrawing her touch , " about how tragic and ugly the whole business is ? " " No , I meant it . Certainly I meant it . Tragic . Yes . " The disappointment in her voice makes me desperate . I struggle to remember what exactly I 'm supposed to mean . Something from Sadly 's usual spiel . " But , after all , there 's nothing we can do about it . That 's the real world , right ? " Jesus nods . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was ? " she asks , " Was what ? " " Something you could do ? " " Maybe there is , " I say , grasping at a thread of inspiration , " Maybe just by being part of the system , some tiny bit of myself - a smidgen of my humanness - infects CAptivity , changes it from within . I like to think so , anyway . " " It 's a nice thought , " she says . " What about more direct action ? " Jesus asks . They watch me expectantly . I ca n't imagine where they 're headed , but I 'm willing to go along . " Direct action , " I echo , as if intrigued . " I have a good feeling about him , " Oona declares . I return Jesus 's stare with fresh confidence . He looks unconvinced , but eventually he reaches into a duffle bag under his chair and puts an object in the center of the table . I turn it in my hands . It 's a crude , convex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips and circuitry hand-wired to the surface ... an ugly bit of business , nothing like the sleek , custom molded shell I 'm used to , but a CApp of sorts , nonetheless . .. " How about that , " I say . The beer is n't sitting well . I ignore a tremor of nausea . " It 's a reader , Paul , " Oona says . " It ca n't be detected or traced . It does n't alter the data stream . " " Why not ? " To my deep satisfaction , Jesus looks surprised . " ' Direct action . " That 's what you said . Why not randomize a few digits , distort a few images , substitute one face for another ? " I feel distorted myself , as if squeezed arotind the middle by a great hand , though my voice remains composed . " We do n't - We ca n't - " Jesus pauses to gather himself . " We 're not in a position to confront the political/industrial complex yet . For the moment we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the data stream is really devoted to scientific research and technical analysis , and how much to the covert war against the people . Who are they watching ? How detailed are their files ? " Oona puts a hand on my shoulder . I look into her hazelnut eyes and catch a whiff of her pungent spice , a tang that borders between the tantalizing and distasteful . " Paul , " she asks as softly as the ambient noise will allow , " Would you be willing to wear a reader over your CApp when you go online ? " " Why not ? " I ask . She smiles , taking this as casual agreement , missing the urgency in the question , the ache for a real answer . The churning in my stomach wo n't wait any longer . " I 'll be right back , " I say , pushing up from the table . I worm my way back through the crowd . The bathroom door muffles the din of voices and noise . Standing over the sink , I wonder whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut and making my heart work overtime . All three , I decide . Or maybe I 'm coming down with something . I call William 's cell . " I knew it was just a matter of time , " he says when I describe the situation . " You 've completely lost your mind . " " I did n't say I 'd actually do it . " " Can you hear yourself ? Do you have any idea how quickly you 'll lose your CApp ? That 's if Homeland security does n't just put you away . You 're talking about messing with the data stream . " " She told me it does n't alter anything ... just monitors what 's going on . " The explanation sounds weak even as I offer it . " You poor , love-struck doofus. " he says . " Do n't you get it ? Your dream girl is right ; people are being watched , and she 's one of them . Why else would you keep catching traces of her ? " " I know that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's obvious the moment he says it . What did I think they were , all those personal files floating through the data stream ? Phone listings ? Census data ? There 's no point in wasting valuable CApp time on simple record keeping . Real-time recognition and conspiracy vectoring , on the other hand , involve just the kinds of multidimensional analyses that make CAptives such valuable commodities . Faintly through the phone I hear Sadly ask what 's going on . William shushes her . " So what do I do ? " My stomach has calmed down , but now my head is throbbing . " Get back out there , " he says . " Keep them talking . I 'll call Homeland security . " I CATCH A GLIMPSE of them through the crowd before they see me . Jesus looks jumpy . He holds the ersatz CApp inside his jacket , out of sight . Oona flattens her lips in the same expression I saw in the trace - was it just this morning ? Then she notices me approaching and smiles as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help myself ; I melt . " So - " Jesus says . " I ca n't , " I tell Oona in a rush , half expecting a squad of government agents to burst into the Afterlife at any second . " It 's not that I 'm afraid of losing the work , though I am . And it 's not the toys I would n't be able to afford , the meals I 'd have to give up or the rent I would n't be able to pay . It 's not even that I believe the data stream is sacrosanct , or anything like that . Or maybe it is all of that . I do n't know . I just know the thought of putting that god-awful thing on my head makes me sick to my stomach . I wish I could . I wish I could do it for you . I 've dreamed about you for months . Well , not exactly dreamed . What do you know about traces ? " I see hints of alarm in Oona 's eyes . Jesus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " Yeah , you 'd better go . They 're keeping an eye you . They 'll probably be here any minute . I 'm sorry I could n't - I 'm just sorry . " They 've already moved away through the crowd . I sit , watching after them . Suddenly Oona reappears . She bends over and kisses me softly on the cheek . Then she 's gone . I 'm still sitting there a half hour later when the Homeland security agent finally shows up . William leads him to my table . I expect to see a grizzled military type ; Agent Herfel , short and stoop-shouldered , looks more like an accountant . He asks a few questions , takes a few desultory notes . " Hack into the data stream undetected - " He snorts derisively , stands . " I would n't worry about these people too much . " William walks outside with me . It 's early by our usual standards , but I 'm in no mood to booze it up with the gang . " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your guess is as good as mine . " He laughs , lightly punches my shoulder . I head down Smith Street for home . Upstairs , I turn on the lights , then turn them off again . I 'm too wired to sleep , too punchy to listen to music or watch video . The evening 's events churn through my head . William was right ; I could have lost everything . It was a close call . So this must be relief I 'm feeling . Strange it should seem so wretched . I find myself reaching for the CApp on its cradle . The circuit is off Une , of course , but simply the gesture of settling it upon its perfect circle of bare scalp conjures up the familiar sensation of blurred tranquillity . For a moment the dissonant voices of doubt and dismay fall silent . Cone is the bedlam of self that clamors beneath sensible being . Gone are the inner cackles of discontent , the wails of loss and despair , the laments for the person I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until morning for a more lasting deliverance , but for these few seconds , at least , I create my own blessed CAptivity .
