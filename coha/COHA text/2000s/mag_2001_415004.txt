HOW FACTORY FISHING DECIMATED NEWFOUNDLAND COD // FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO , THE EXPLORER JOHN CABOT RETURNED FROM THE WATERS AROUND WHAT IS NOW NEWFOUNDLAND AND REPORTED THAT CODFISH RAN SO THICK YOU COULD CATCH THEM BY HANGING WICKER BASKETS OVER A SHIP 'S SIDE . CABOT HAD DISCOVERED A RESOURCE THAT WOULD CHANGE ENGLAND FOREVER , THE BASIS OF A MARITIME TRADE THAT WOULD GIVE THAT TINY ISLAND KINGDOM THE WEALTH , SKILLS AND SHIPBUILDING CAPACITY WHICH WOULD TRANSFORM IT INTO A GLOBAL EMPIRE . HE HAD DISCOVERED THE MOST FANTASTIC FISHING GROUNDS THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN , WATERS SO TEEMING WITH LIFE THAT A VAST SWATH OF THE NEW WORLD WAS COLONIZED JUST TO HARVEST ITS SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS BOUNTY . A century after Cabot , English fishing skippers still reported cod shoals " so thick by the shore that we hardly have been able to row a boat through them . " There were sixand seven-foot-long codfish weighing as much as 200 pounds . There were great banks of oysters as large as shoes . At low tide , children were sent to the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use as bait or pig feed . Eight- to 12-foot sturgeon choked New England rivers , and salmon packed streams from the Hudson River to Hudson 's Bay . Herring , squid and capelin ( a small open-water fish seven inches long ) spawning runs were so gigantic they astonished observers for more than four centuries . Today , Newfoundland 's fish are gone and the seas , streams and rivers lie quiet and empty . AN ISOLATED TREASURE HOUSE If Canada 's 10 provinces , the combined territory of Newfoundland and Labrador is the least accessible . Most of its half million people live on the great , barren island of Newfoundland-a landmass of 39,500 square miles , about the size of Virginia , consisting of rocky shores , barren heaths and rolling hills of stunted pine . In winter the island is buffeted by arctic winds , and in early summer the north coast is battered by icebergs floating down from Greenland . ( Labrador , the province 's mainland component , is three times the size of the island but has only a few thousand residents ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far north , too cold , barren and remote to support a large population . ) Even in summer , a trip from Boston to St. John 's , the capital city , entails 16 hours of driving and 14 hours on the ferry . Like so much of Newfoundland , the Burin peninsula was founded on fishing . There 's evidence that Basque fishermen used the peninsula as a summer fishing base during the early 1500s . French fishermen may have been living there as early as the 1640s , though most left in the early 18th century when the area was ceded to England . During the heyday of the Grand Banks schooner fishery , Burin towns were thriving and enormous Victorian mansions were erected in the town of Grand Bank . In the mechanized , industrial-scale , deep-sea trawler era , the peninsula was at the heart of the fish-processing business , with year-round seafood plants in Fortune , Marystown , St. Lawrence , Grand Bank and Burin proper , and seasonal ones in three smaller hamlets . Most of the 29,000 people on the peninsula either fished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants , or for the shipyard that built the offshore trawlers that fed the hungry assembly lines with massive quantities of ocean fish . The Burin plant provided a great many of the fish patties used in McDonald 's fillet-o-fish ' sandwiches . It still does , but the fish it uses is imported from Europe . That 's because the impossible has happened . The last great schools of northern cod were scooped up in colossal trawler nets and the government has closed the world 's greatest fishery for lack of fish-a ridiculous example of closing the barn door after the horse has escaped . In 1996 , the Burin Peninsula recorded the highest unemployment rate in Canada for several months in a row . An estimated 30 percent of the workforce was jobless . " Fishin 's all there was , " said an area fisherman . " Everybody got too greedy for them fish , en then there was n't anything a'tall THE PURSUIT OF COD Until 1949 , Newfoundland was a British colony and to this day it feels like a far-flung outpost of Northern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and Ireland through family ties , commerce , political life and trade . With the development of freezer technology on the eve of World War II , the United States became a major market for Newfoundland cod , but there was little contact-commercial or otherwise-with Canada . It 's no accident that St. John 's is located on the island 's easternmost extreme , nestled between mountains on a harbor opening toward Britain , somewhere out beyond the perpetual wall of fog . From St. John 's , London is closer than Calgary , and Ireland nearer than Winnipeg . The settlement of Newfoundland , indeed of much of North America , was a byproduct of the pursuit of cod . Properly dried and salted codfish would keep for long periods , an important consideration before refrigeration . It was relatively light and easy to transport . From the advent of the New World fisheries in the early 14th century , there was an insatiable , ready market for saltcod in Europe . It was a far cheaper protein source than beef , pork , or lamb , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every year . Profitable , transportable and easily marketable , cod would rival South American gold and Caribbean sugar in the New World resource-extraction free-for-all . The story of the cod 's destruction , however , begins when Newfoundland 's colonial era ends . For the first four centuries after Cabot , Newfoundlanders had little trouble actually finding and catching cod . There were seemingly endless numbers of them . These large , hardy , generic-looking fish are built to last : Adaptable , omnivorous and incredibly fecund ( a large female will produce nine million eggs in a single spawning ) . Atlantic cod survived in their current form for 10 million years , through ice ages and warming spells that changed world sea levels by some 300 feet . They live 20 years or more , ensuring a diverse breeding stock . Particularly cold spawning seasons would select cold-resistant eggs , warm seasons would bring the opposite , and with so many generations present at any one time , the cod has been able to adapt to almost everything . Everything , that is , except industrialized fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " groundfish , " so called because they generally live on or near the ocean bottom along the continental shelf . The Northwest Atlantic 's other groundfish include haddock , halibut , pollock , flounder and plaice . All these species have been intensively fished and many have shared the sad fate of their cousin , the cod . But the Atlantic cod was by far the most numerous , valuable and important . Atlantic cod not only school , they live in distinct breeding stocks or populations . Each moves as a vast herd from spawning to feeding grounds and rarely associates with other camps . The " northern " cod dwell off the icy coasts of Labrador and northeastern Newfoundland . Another population spawns on the nutrient-rich Grand Banks , a vast series of underwater hills sunk in shallow water off the Newfoundland coast . There are distinct stocks in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , which separates the island from Quebec and Labrador , and on the smaller St. Pierre Banks near Burin ; another masses along Nova Scotia 's Atlantic coast , and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in somewhat warmer water and are markedly larger and faster growing than their compatriots in ice-choked Labrador . Other Atlantic Cod stocks populate the European and Icelandic coasts . Fishermen benefited from the cod 's tendency to congregate in great numbers . When spawning , cod gather in dense clumps of hundreds of millions of fish . Northern and Grand Banks fish spawned on respective portions of the offshore banks , sowing the ocean currents with trillions of eggs . This made it possible for men to catch them in vast numbers with handlines and , in recent decades , to scoop up entire stocks with enormous nets hauled by trawlers the size of a small ocean liner . For many centuries , though , it was the cod 's next move that put food on the table . After spawning , the vast schools would spread into sheets and head inshore , beating the ocean for prey . They would eventually find it : even vaster schools of capelin . For reasons still unknown , some of these capelin schools spawn on the offshore banks like the cod , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cod are greedy , however , and will eat almost anything they can fit into their gaping mouths . In nature this made them versatile , willing to eat whatever is available : whole mussels , crabs , lobsters , squid , even juvenile cod . It also made baiting them very easy . They can reportedly be landed with an unadorned lump of lead , pieces of hot dog , even Styrofoam cups . Once hooked they put up no fight at all they just hang there as they 're pulled into the boat . STRIP MINING THE SEAS In 1951 , a strange ship flying the British flag arrived on the Grand Banks . It was enormous : 280 feet long and 2,600 gross tons , four times the size of a large trawler . It 's superstructure , tall funnels and numerous portholes suggested an ocean-going passenger liner , but its aft deck confirmed it to be a fishing vessel . Gantry masts supported cables , winches , and gear the scale of which nobody had seen before . Its stern was marred by a gigantic chute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships use to drag aboard the 190-ton carcasses of blue whales . But the ramp was meant not for whales but for equally large nets filled with cod and whatever else happened to be in the water . The Fairtry 's arrival marked the beginning of the end for the Atlantic cod fishery , indeed for many of the world 's fisheries . She was the world 's first factory-freezer trawler , a multi-million-dollar vessel equipped with all the technological breakthroughs of the war . Below deck was an on-board processing plant with automated filleting machines , a fish meal rendering factory and an enormous bank of freezers . She could fish around the clock , seven days a week , for weeks on end , hauling up nets during fierce winter gales that could easily swallow the Statue of Liberty . With radar , sonar , fish-finders and echograms she could pinpoint and capture whole schools of fish with chilling effectiveness . The ships grew bigger . They eventually reached 8,000 tons , towing nets with openings 3,500 feet in circumference . In an hour they can haul up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a typical 16th century ship would have caught in an entire season . Re-crewed and supplied by ocean-going tenders , the ships could pursue fish anywhere in the world for months on end without ever visiting a port or even sighting land . Plying international waters , they were outside the jurisdiction of the nations off which they fished . By the 1970s the Soviet Union had 400 factory trawlers on the high seas . Japan had 125 , Spain , 75 , West Germany , 50 , France and Britain , 40 , and dozens more were operated by East Bloc nations . They plied the Georges Banks of New England , the hake stocks of South Africa , Alaskan and Baring Sea Pollock , Antarctic krill and , most of all , the northern cod off Newfoundland and Labrador . They were strip-mining the sea . Photograph The once hugely abundant stocks of Atlantic cod ( above ) have been devastated , not by the livelihoods of single fishermen ( right ) but by gigantic trawlers that " strip mine " the sea . // END GAME In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost three times more than had been caught in any year prior to the Fairtry 's arrival . Then , despite increased effort , larger nets , more accurate fish finders and larger on-board processing plants , total cod landings fell . Two Canadian fisheries scientists , Jeffrey Hutchings and Ransom Myers , have calculated that about eight million tons of northern cod were caught between Cabot 's arrival in 1647 and 1750 , a period encompassing 25 to 40 cod generations . The factory trawlers matched that take in only 15 years-well within a single cod lifetime . The trawlers were scooping up fish many times faster than the ecosystem could replenish them . Not just cod but other groundfish , including flounder , halibut and haddock , were decimated . In 1977 Canada followed Iceland in unilaterally extending its territorial waters from 12 to 200 miles offshore . Foreign factory trawlers were kicked off the Banks except for a small portion called " the Tail " that lies beyond 200 miles . But by this time the groundfish stocks were so depleted that many factory trawlers had already moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted with euphoria in Atlantic Canada . Finally the Banks would be used for the benefit of Canadians . But in a remarkable display of shortsightedness , Canada proceeded to build a deep-sea trawler fleet of its own . Foreign fishing had shattered the ecology of the Northwest Atlantic fisheries . The Canadian government proceeded to finish off the survivors . The expansion of the domestic industry created an economic imperative that more fish be caught . " Under-utilized " fish stocks had to be captured to keep processing plants busy . So while the new fleet was under construction , joint ventures were set up with foreign factory trawlers to capture fish on the banks ; the trawlers would land part of their catch at Newfoundland fish plants and keep the rest to land at home . The collapse of the Banks was right around the corner . THEN THEY WERE GONE Donald Paul is a self-employed inshore fisherman who 's been working the waters off Burin since 1974 . He owns his own small boat and works the near-coastal waters around Placentia Bay , landing fish ashore at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fishing . " Back when I started there were plenty of fish , " Paul says . " I 'd say the first year I noticed something was 1978 . In normal years we 'd get 200,000 pounds of cod , but that year it was more like 70,000 pounds . Then all of a sudden they just crashed . " The shock came in 1988 . New modeling techniques and the latest stock survey revealed that many groundfish stocks were on the edge of collapse . The northern cod stock-by far the largest and most important-was in the worst shape of all . Fisheries scientists concluded that quotas had to be more than halved in order to prevent this stock 's collapse . Politicians were appalled ; the proposed quotas would have caused economic chaos throughout Eastern Canada . So the politicians compromised what could not be compromised . Quotas were cut by only 10 percent . More frightening data poured in confirming the stock was in serious trouble , that fishermen had been capturing as much as 60 percent of the adult cod every year for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Canada released $584 million in emergency assistance . Fishermen tried as hard as they could , but could only catch 122,000 of the 190,000-ton cod quota for 1991 . The stock was in free fall . When the 1992 fish surveys were released , politicians finally realized that regardless of what quotas they set , nature had spoken : there would be no fish to feed the plants and working families of Atlantic Canada . The estimated combined weight of the adult cod population was a mere 1.1 percent of its historic levels of the early 1960s . In 1992 , the government finally closed the Banks altogether to allow the stock to recover . But by then it was far too late . TOO LITTLE . TOO LATE Even if left alone , the northern cod may never recover . Industrial technology and human greed may have so decimated these hardy fish that they can no longer hold onto their ecological niche . The crash could be irreversible . " They might never come back , at least not in their former abundance , " says Richard Haedrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " Once you start changing the whole ecosystem , the community structures and sizes , you 've got a whole new ball game . " Photograph The collapse of the cod fishery had devastating ripple effects through the economy of Eastern Canada . Thousands of fish processors lost their jobs along with the fishermen . // There is growing evidence that the trawlers may not only have scooped up all the fish but also laid to waste the entire seafloor environment those fish required to survive . In the late 1990s , marine scientists began assembling evidence that modern fishing gear causes massive physical and ecological disturbances . The continental shelf-where most ecological and , thus , fishing activity takes place-is not a featureless plain of mud . Rocky outcroppings , boulders , cobbles and pebbles provide " structure " on and around which living communities can thrive . Here , juvenile cod and other fish can hide from predators and find small crustaceans , crabs and other creatures to eat . Modern bottom trawls destroy these structures like gigantic plows . Dragging the bottom for cod or flounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " doors " or " boards " weighing tens to thousands of pounds . The bottom of the trawl mouth is a thick cable bearing the weight of 50- to 700-pound steel weights that keep the trawl on the seabed . Many drag tickler chains to scare shrimp or fish off the bottom and into the net . Scallop , oyster and crab dredges consist of steel frames and chain-mesh bags that plow through the seabed to sift out target species . With each pass , trawls and dredges overturn , scrape or sweep away boulders and cobbles , crush or ensnare bottom plants and structure-building animals , and kill or disrupt worms and other animals in the sediment . Most species take months or years to reestablish themselves , some take decades or centuries . None are given that much time . In a 1998 paper , Les Wading of the University of Maine and Elliot Norse of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute likened trawling 's effect on the seabed to that of forest clear-cutting , except that it occurs over an area of the Earth 's surface that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much juvenile cod habitat that the Banks are no longer capable of nursing large numbers of the fish . Recovery would require decades without trawling . These disruptions have allowed opportunistic creatures to move in . In some areas small skates and dogfish ( a small shark species ) appear to have taken over the cod 's niche in the ecosystem . Scavengers like the snow crab and American lobster underwent incredible population explosions as the cod stocks collapsed . Large cod once ate these crustaceans , but now there are n't any cod large enough . There 's some evidence that the current crab and lobster fishing booms were also fueled by huge quantities of dead animals falling to the seafloor after being dumped as by-catch from trawlers . It 's not certain that Canada has learned from its mistakes with the cod . The fishery has simply turned to alternative species further down the food chain and , in at least some instances , may be pushing their populations towards collapse . After several years of intensive fishing , total landings of " under-utilized " fish like herring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Canada as a whole . Thousands of tons of lumpfish are harvested for their roe and urchins for their gonads-both products prized on the Asian market . Meanwhile the keystone species of the entire ecosystem-the humble capelin-has again become the target of a sizeable fishery . Throughout the last decade , Newfoundland fishermen were unable to catch enough of the tiny fish to fill their quotas . Canada 's Department of Fisheries and Oceans maintains that the stocks are healthy ; rural residents across the province think the government 's models will once again be proven wrong . Jack May , the keeper of Twillingate Lighthouse a few miles west of Newfoundland 's Fogo Island , and a poet who regularly reads his historical work on the Canadian Broadcasting Company 's provincial morning show , is n't optimistic about the cod returning . " We do n't seem to be able to see the big picture , " he says . " We see a few extra shrimp in the system and we go like hell after them and grab them all up and say , Hey , we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishery worth billions ! ' But it 's only going to stay that way if we look at it 10 years down the road . We do n't set the rules , we can only try to work within them . " <p>
