Gary Pilgrim and Harold Baxter got rich running their mutual fund business , and their investors did not . That 's because they turned it from a fiduciary into a virtual casino . And in a casino , // Back in 1997 , the new headquarters of Pilgrim Baxter &; Associates was like a raucous boomtown within the otherwise sedate Main Line suburb of Wayne , Pa . The firm tripled its office space because it had quintupled its business with the roaring success of its PBHG Growth fund . Manager Gary Pilgrim 's bold " momentum " investing style captured not just assets but the very Zeitgeist of the ' ' 90s bull market . Who cared what companies actually did ? The question was , How fast would they grow ? People ditched horse-and-buggy " value " investing for the rocket ride of momentum . They flooded PBHG 's toll-free lines with 80,000 calls a month , looking to plunk their money into its funds . Reporters paraded in to interview Pilgrim . Staffers constantly broke out the bubbly to celebrate milestones : $5 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no danger of being struck by flying champagne corks today . You could shoot a cannonball through Pilgrim Baxter headquarters and hit only cleaned-out desks . It 's so still you can almost feel the reverberations from last Nov. 20 , when the SEC and New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer turned their cannons on Pilgrim and his partner , Harold Baxter . The two men are accused of defrauding their long-term investors by letting favored short-term investors hop in and out of the funds at will . These so-called market-timers took advantage of a lag between the daily changes in the actual market value of a fund 's stocks and the fund 's publicly reported value . Pilgrim Baxter is just one of seven mutual funds regulators have sued , or settled with , over market-timing violations-and more will follow . Spitzer 's chief mutual fund buster , assistant attorney general David Brown , predicted in a recent speech that another ten to 20 firms will be cited . We 're not talking about a few bad apples here . The market-timing scandals represent the culmination of a 20-year drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small investors to shark-infested waters . Mutual funds ' assets grew 20-fold , to $7 trillion , in that period , but it was the funds ' owners , not customers , who got wealthy . The hucksters who flocked to this business preferred slickly gathering assets to prudently managing them . They offered more kinds of funds than Baskin-Robbins does ice cream and relentlessly hustled their flavor of the month . They promoted hot fund managers as stars and advertised their funds much as Paramount does blockbuster movies . The promise of riches was illusory to investors , who often jumped into sizzling funds just as their returns crested and declined . For proprietors , on the other hand , mutual funds were virtually ATM machines . You could get 40% profit margins while you ran them and real money when you sold them . In 1998 alone , mutual fund operators reaped a $20 billion windfall by selling out to insurers , banks , and others clamoring to get into the business . And the more wealth these operators accrued , the more mutual funds diverged from their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pilgrim Baxter is n't the biggest firm charged with market-timing , but it may be the starkest example of how the profit motive swamped fiduciary duty . Gary Pilgrim and Harold Baxter were the guys with their name on the door , not factotums at a giant like Putnam . Yet they allegedly threw the door wide open and welcomed in a shady new breed of trader . They shored up Pilgrim Baxter 's eroding asset base-and thus the fees they earned-by allowing market-timers to bend the rules and reap profits . At the same time , PBHG 's legitimate customers suffered losses . Investors who got into the firm 's hottest funds as of year-end 1996 cumulatively lost $3 billion , according to the Bogle Financial Markets Research Center . Fully a quarter of that sum may have stemmed from market-timing activities , legal investigators estimate , for the timers ' profits translated to other investors ' losses . Meanwhile , Pilgrim and Baxter personally cleared an estimated $1 billion between them over the years from operating and selling the firm . The attorney for Gary Pilgrim and Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Spitzer suits . Both Pilgrim and Baxter declined to comment on the allegations . They also declined to comment on estimates of the market-timers ' toll on customers and of their earnings from the firm . " No firm has been a bigger beneficiary of the trends that propelled this industry , " says Don Phillips , managing director of mutual fund tracker Morningstar . " Pilgrim Baxter caught wave after wave : momentum investing , investors chasing performance , instant mass distribution from Schwab OneSource . They got phenomenally lucky , but instead of being grateful , they kept pushing the envelope . " " Not Gary Pilgrim . " That 's the first thing everyone said when they heard the news . He was an Eagle Scout , a straight arrow ; even his name sounded like something from an Ayn Rand novel . Pilgrim came from Oklahoma , actually . His personality was dry as a dust bowl , making him seem a natural for his position in investments at Philadelphia National Bank 's trust department . Yet it turned out that beneath that laconic surface lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional accounts into the usual blue chips , Pilgrim discovered and plunged into small-cap stocks that were growing fast-until they stopped doing so . His portfolio was either sizzling or fizzling . He told investors they could expect great long-term returns , but they 'd better ignore both the dips and the spikes . He stayed on message , even when in January of 1993 he got his first-ever call from the Wall Street Journal , which had ranked tiny PBHG Growth as the top mutual fund of the prior quarter . " That 's ridiculous , " Pilgrim told the reporter . " That does n't mean a thing . " But Pilgrim did n't need an ounce of self-promotion when he had Harold Baxter , one of those classic salesmen who , in the words of a Philadelphia money manager , " could sell refrigerators to Eskimos . " The large , gabby native of Queens , N. Y , was selling the Philadelphia bank 's trust service when he came across Gary Pilgrim and found what every salesman loves-a point of differentiation . Sure , you should mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but give Gary just a little slice of your assets and give yourself some upside . Live a little ! Baxter left the bank in 1982 to go independent with Pilgrim and two other trust colleagues . Then Pilgrim started to really hit his stride , refining his stock-picking abilities with a computer stock-screening system , called QRS , developed by an early partner , George Greig . If reciting Pilgrim 's returns did n't win over prospective clients , Harold Baxter just golfed them into submission . His client outings to Pebble Beach were n't to be missed , and his wit was always on . Jackie Charnley , a Dana Point , Calif. , consultant , shares her log of one Baxter call : " As usual , Harold had me laughing from the moment I picked up the phone . " When she asked after Pilgrim , Baxter cracked , " Gary 's as exciting as ever-like watching paint dry . " He was n't just the Willy Loman of growth stocks , however ; he also had a sense for the next wave and how to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he figured out that institutional investors were getting adventuresome enough for Gary Pilgrim 's white-knuckled ride , in the early ' ' 90s he saw that average Americans were shedding their inhibitions about investing in mutual funds . It just so happened he had one . PBHG Growth was n't much back then-it had been started as a favor to an institutional client and possessed only $8 million of assets in 1992 . But Baxter was ready to answer when opportunity knocked . Pilgrim was on one of his periodic tears when Money magazine ( FORTUNE 'S sister publication ) discovered him . It calculated that PBHG Growth was the nation 's top-performing mutual fund from mid-1992 to mid-1993 , with a 69% return . The spikes of an $8 million fund are n't all that meaningful , but this time Gary Pilgrim did n't snort , " Ridiculous . " He gave an interview to Money , which ran a story lionizing " this little-known hotshot " in its August 1993 issue . Pilgrim Baxter had recently switched PBHG Growth from a " load " fund , requiring up-front fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also just set up an 800 number . Before the Money story ran , it had received six calls . After the story appeared-with the phone number-3,000 calls a day poured in from people clamoring to put their money into PBHG . Baxter had applied precisely the right formula for building the modern-day mutual fund : Create a track record , create a star manager , create a media buzz , and welcome the pigeons-er , customers . By year-end , PBHG Growth had $120 million and had only just begun . In 1994 , Baxter the salesman geared up for his biggest sale yet . He called Norton Reamer , CEO of a company called United Asset Management , and started talks to sell Pilgrim Baxter . Boston-based UAM was an acquirer of , and a holding company for , asset-management firms . UAM would buy out the partners , retain their services , and split revenues with them , roughly fifty-fifty . All of its 41 " affiliates " then were old-school " value " managers for institutional accounts . Reamer liked the idea of getting a growth shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1995 , UAM bought Pilgrim Baxter for $135 million . The kid from Queens was rich . He had a big stone house in the Main Line suburb of Berwyn , where he installed a first-class wine cellar and , with his wife , Christine , entertained lavishly . He bused legions of buddies to the Army-Navy game . He drove a top-of-the-line Mercedes , joined the elite Pine Valley Country Club , and played golf galore . Gary Pilgrim never mingled socially with Baxter-or with just about anyone else , as far as colleagues could tell . When Pilgrim was n't in his office he disappeared into his home on an isolated road in the less fashionable suburb of Malvern . At a party UAM threw after acquiring Pilgrim Baxter , Norton Reamer made a little speech to assure the firm 's employees that nothing would change . Then Pilgrim was pushed to his feet to say a few words . " Well , that 's not really true , Mr. Reamer , " he said , as later recounted in SmartMoney magazine . " One thing has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " As a matter of fact , a big change was in the works . Pilgrim Baxter was still mainly an institutional firm when the UAM deal closed in April 1995-PBHG Growth made up only a quarter of the firm 's $4 billion of assets . But Pilgrim Baxter was about to morph into a very different , very retail beast . Momentum investing , a niche in the 1980s , was the essence of the 1990s bull market . The old preoccupation with fundamentals and P/E ratios went the way of the ticker tape ; young , high-tech companies were thought to have potential that overshadowed profits . Mutual fund families gave birth to growth funds by the gross during the bubble . Just as casinos offer something for every gambler 's taste-blackjack , slots , roulette-mutual funds offered something for every investor 's fancy : micro cap , small cap , everything but baseball cap . And as with the gaming industry , the house won . Mutual funds typically took 1% off the top in management fees . Since their costs grew far less rapidly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business model you could n't beat . Things were n't so great for mutual fund investors , whose returns typically lagged the market . The average fund delivered just 76% of the market 's annual return from 1982 to 2002 , according to the Bogle research center . Much of the discrepancy was due to costs-not just management fees but the funds ' transactions charges and taxes . The increasingly speculative nature of mutual funds was dispiriting to some who remembered a time when they were supposed to reduce risk by pooling small investors ' money and spreading investments over many stocks . " There was a missionary zeal to it then , " says Burt Greenwald , a Philadelphia mutual fund consultant who entered the business in 1958 . " We were doing God 's work for the modest investor . From 1980 on , there was a slow disintegration of that culture and an entry of people who realized it was a hot business . " Among the momentum funds , PBHG Growth was the hottest of the hot . Lipper , in January 1996 , ranked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1990s but also for the prior decade . The October 1996 Kiplinger 's investment newsletter declared : " Forget Peter Lynch : Gary Pilgrim is the best stock picker of the past five years and the past ten . " Harold Baxter had always been able to sense that next wave , but he never expected a tsunami . The mutual fund grew from $2 billion by the end of 1995 to $5 billion by mid-1996 . He created new specialty funds-PBHG Emerging Growth ( small cap ) , PBHG Limited ( micro cap ) , PBHG Large Cap . As the money washed in , it quickly became clear that he had sold his firm too soon and too cheaply . By mid-1996 , Pilgrim Baxter was at $15 billion in total assets , with a bullet . People familiar with UAM 's revenue-sharing formula estimate Baxter and Pilgrim were splitting $20 million a year . But in the latter half of the ' ' 90s , the serious money was made by selling mutual funds , not by operating them . Michael Price , for instance , sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Baxter had sold out for a lousy $135 million . It was enough to make a man want to crawl into his wine cellar and never emerge . Baxter became fixated on how much money he had left on the table , former associates say , and on how much he could yet make to set that right . That imperative manifested itself in any number of ways : * THE HOARDING . UAM encouraged the principals of firms it acquired to share the wealth with nonpartners . Norton Reamer wanted sale proceeds to be spread around to keep key managers motivated . Harold Baxter would n't do that , but he promised the staff something else . After deducting UAM 's share of revenues and firm expenses , he would put Pilgrim Baxter 's annual take into two pots . A large majority would go into the " A " pool , to be divided by him and Pilgrim . The rest went to a " B " pool , to be divvied by the rest . Later , Baxter made another seeming act of largesse , giving fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so and collect anywhere from $250,000 upwards . Only later did they learn Baxter had paid the bonuses out of that " B " pool-in other words , with their own money . * THE DAUGHTERS . Baxter was genuinely devoted to his wife , Christine , and their four children . " I love my family more than you love the air you breathe , " he once said to me . " The amount of golf I give up for them ... " That devotion extended to the Baxter family business , where he made one daughter , Patty , a $100,000-a-year office manager , and put another , Chrissie , in charge of the PBHG Emerging Growth fund , fresh from her graduation as a University of Pennsylvania philosophy major . After a strong first three years , when she averaged 42% returns ( aided , as with the early PBHG Growth , by hefty IPO allocations ) , Chrissie faltered , wearied of mutual funds , and moved on to a PBHG private equities fund . She was succeeded by a young woman named Erin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Analyst ) credentials but was Patty Baxter 's best friend . The Baxter girls had Dad wrapped around their fingers . Chrissie became friends with a trader named Margaret Mace , who chafed under head trader Scott Shellhammer . Mace decided to leave , but Chrissie would n't hear of it . She insisted that her friend become the trading-desk boss . Though Shellhammer was very good at his job and a Gary Pilgrim protege , he was gone . * THE HEDGE FUND . The PBHG growth funds were a management challenge , yet on the side Harold Baxter was quietly developing another business . In 1995 he brought into the firm a California-based hedge fund , Palomar Capital Management , whose mastermind was a former Montgomery Securities partner named Ben Simon . Baxter delivered to Palomar some of its investors and most of its market edge . Simon was privy to the holdings of the PBHG funds and their trading plans , according to people then working at the firm . That was very good dope , since Gary Pilgrim had the clout to move stocks . Pilgrim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge fund 's asset totals . Through a spokesperson , Pilgrim and Baxter deny that they shared portfolio knowledge or earned management fees . Thomas Krouse , then Palomar 's chief executive , says , " We utilized the same research group ( as the PBHG funds ) and sometimes traded in the same stocks on the same days . But explicit compliance features were in place to assure fairness . " He declines to discuss fees but acknowledges that there were " financial incentives " for Pilgrim and Baxter . People at the firm who had admired Pilgrim were increasingly vexed and perplexed . Pilgrim was not just an investing talent but a doer of good deeds-active in a Presbyterian church , sponsor of a Vietnamese family 's U.S. immigration . He never seemed a grasper like his partner . ( I once asked him , after PBHG Growth 's $3 billion hemorrhage in 1997-98 , if he felt bad about all the money lost . " That would assume , " Pilgrim replied , " that money is important . " ) So colleagues hoped he would counterbalance Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . He was like the piano player at the bordello who did n't want to know what was going on upstairs ; he just wanted to keep the music going and pocket the checks . Like his partner , Pilgrim developed pricey tastes . Baxter bought a $4 million house on Nantucket ; Pilgrim bought a $5.5 million house there . Baxter bought a $3.5 million place in Palm Beach ; Pilgrim bought a $4.8 million place in Naples , Fla . Baxter bought a corporate jet ; Pilgrim bought a share of one too . The poor boy from Oklahoma got as distant from his roots-and his customers-as the kid from Queens . Every time Harold Baxter had a choice between building his net worth and building an institution , he opted for the former . The PBHG funds were far too dependent for business on the Schwab and Fidelity " supermarkets " - so called because people can one-stop-shop for a wide variety of funds . PBHG Growth owed much of its mid- ' ' 90s growth spurt to Schwab OneSource , but those assets were known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the latest chart-topping funds . Once they cooled off , those fickle sorts moved on to another aisle . Pilgrim Baxter would have had a stabler foundation had it sold funds through networks of stockbrokers or financial planners . Several times Baxter made tentative runs at doing so , only to conclude it would take too much trouble and money . In 1997 he even hired former Fidelity executive Paul Hondros , a marketing and distribution whiz . Hondros rapidly set about building up Pilgrim Baxter 's business side , which had advanced woefully little from when marketing and distribution consisted of Harold Baxter regaling clients at the 19th hole . Three problems quickly developed . Baxter had made Hondros the firm 's president , but he did n't really want to share power . Baxter found it was costly to hire " wholesalers " who mass-marketed funds and to make deals to enter stockbrokers ' networks . The third problem was PBHG Growth . After its long , steep climb , the fund reached the top of the roller coaster-and careened down . In one 12-month stretch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.1 billion . Part of the reason was that momentum investing lost momentum . Investors looking for the next big killing became more enamored of big-cap stocks . But the fund 's customers were also paying a steep price for its operators ' greed . The momentum game requires agility , and PBHG Growth had become far too big to continue reaping large returns . With so much money , Gary Pilgrim could n't get into or out of stocks as quickly as he once did . Many firms close popular funds when they reach a point at which their size will diminish returns . Not Pilgrim Baxter . It did temporarily close PBHG Growth in 1995 , at $5 billion in assets . But it reopened the fund in early 1996 , just in time to take advantage of the No. 1 ranking by Lipper . At $6 billion , the fund bore no resemblance to the sloop in which Gary Pilgrim made his name . It was more like a destroyer-a wealth destroyer . After the long run of grand years for Pilgrim Baxter , 1998 was a perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Russian currency crisis . The short but menacing entry of the bear was particularly hard on the firm . Investors ' flight to quality did not take them in the direction of PBHG Growth . After declining 50% in the 12 months ended in August 1998 , it fell another 23% in just one week in September . Then a tentative deal for the firm to be sold-and for Baxter to get the " liquidity event " he craved-fell apart . With Baxter 's and UAM 's blessing , Hondros had found an interested acquirer in Nationwide Insurance . The Columbus , Ohio , company offered $600 million for Pilgrim Baxter , but there was a sticking point : Harold Baxter wanted $100 million of that sum . Even though he and Pilgrim no longer owned the firm , that was the price he set for voiding their UAM revenue-sharing arrangement . In October 1998 , amid the market carnage , Nationwide called off the engagement and walked away . A few days later Paul Hondros got his walking papers . That 's when , the suits say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate customers streamed out , Harold Baxter proved willing to let illegitimate ones in . He wanted to start looking for other buyers , and he had to shore up PBHG 's assets by whatever means necessary . Having dispatched the one executive who could have challenged him , Hondros , and being challenged by no one on his board-the three outside directors had never been in mutual funds-Baxter could pretty much do as he pleased . Baxter 's best friend , Alan Lederfeind , ran a brokerage firm called Wall Street Discount Corp . He had a hedge-fund client called Canary Capital , whose general partner Edward Stern was intrigued with this growing phenomenon of market-timing . It involved using the pedestrian mutual funds of John Q. Public for a slick little arbitrage opportunity . The trick was in taking advantage of how the funds were priced . At the end of each market day the cumulative worth of a fund 's stocks-expressed as " net asset value , " or NAV-was adjusted and publicly posted . But those NAV listings were " stale " ; they did n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a fund had stocks listed on a foreign exchange , for instance , there could be a lag in its latest close 's being reflected in the NAV . But the smart money knew what had happened on the Nikkei . Market-timers could profit from from the spread between a fund 's posted NAV and where they knew the NAV was headed . Harold Baxter met Eddie Stern at the Oak Room in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan , according to investigators , and over dinner gave him carte blanche to market-time the PBHG funds . Pilgrim Baxter would essentially be the training wheels for the firm that became the most notorious mutual fund timer of all . Baxter asked , in return , that Canary put some " sticky assets , " money that was n't jerked in and out of PBHG , into his daughter Chrissie 's private equities fund . Stern came across with $4 million for it , investigators say . Through a spokesperson , Baxter denies that he gave Stern a green light to market-time PBGH funds , and that his daughter 's fund received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughters , but oh , how other PBHG fund managers hated those market-timers- " financial terrorists , " one called them . The hyperactive traders forced managers to buy and sell stock when they did n't want to and to keep more cash on hand than they wished , to cover possible redemptions . Beyond that , market-timers ' transaction costs and arbitrage profits came out of the pockets of the people PBHG was supposed to serve-the buy-and-hold investors . When it reached the point where PBHG funds were being swarmed by an estimated 100 market-timers , some managers complained bitterly to Gary Pilgrim . He approved a new policy , limiting PBHG customers to four trades in and out of funds per year . There was one exception : Alan Lederfeind , whose Wall Street Discount clients , Canary and others , accounted for two-thirds of PBHG 's market-timing activity . And those favored timers did n't just play the game ; they also got big advantages . Investigators say they knew at all times what stocks were owned by the PBHG funds , information the funds had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special relationship that , for the timers , was like shooting fish in a barrel . Pilgrim would later nurture his own special relationship , with a hedge fund called Appalachian Trails L.P. It was run by a former institutional trader he 'd befriended , Michael Christiani , and based on a dense mathematical model that involved shuttling money between equity funds and fixed-income funds . Pilgrim helped Christiani get started with a $1 million investment in 1995 . Then he really helped him starting in 2000 , by allowing Christiani to do his shuttle thing between PBHG Growth and PBHG Cash Reserves , a money-market fund . That year , according to the SEC suit , Pilgrim also increased his investment in Appalachian Trails to $28 million , or a 45% stake . In 2000 and 2001 , Appalachian made $13 million from market-timing the PBHG funds ( of which Pilgrim 's share was $3.9 million ) , while the value of PBHG Growth was sharply declining . What on earth were the motives here ? Harold Baxter and Gary Pilgrim were rich beyond their wildest dreams . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual fund acquisition frenzy . Yes , they had lost billions in assets out of PBHG Growth . But they risked losing something far greater by casting their lot with market-timers : their reputations . Even when the firm 's fortunes spiked back up in 1999 and 2000-the crazed last days of the bubble , when small-cap momentum funds rode tall again-the partners could n't just live off the cornucopia of fees that came when its assets levitated back north of $20 billion . Nope , they had to get the biggest piece of the action in PBHG 's hottest fund . A new micro-cap fund , PBHG New Opportunities , soared 533% that year . Its three biggest shareholders were Mrs. Gary Pilgrim ( 11.6% ) , Harold and Christine Baxter ( 6.7% ) , and the PBHG 401(k) plan ( 5.2% ) . The partners ' stake was buried in an SEC filing but open knowledge around the firm . So was knowledge of PBHG 's usual trick for propelling performance : New Opportunities ' outsized share of IPO allocations . PBHG fund managers began streaming out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other opportunities and so few reasons for loyalty ( see the " B " pool incident mentioned above ) . But it was also because some managers were creeped out by the corruption of the place . " I knew some of what was going on , " says one who left , " and I was terrified by what I did n't know . " UAM executives were pretty terrified too . They maintain today that they never knew about the market-timing . But they did know that Pilgrim Baxter could all but evaporate if the bubble were to burst . UAM engaged Goldman Sachs to scour the world for a buyer . Goldman found one : a British financial services company called Old Mutual . Harold Baxter delivered perhaps his greatest sales job yet for Old Mutual 's brass . He took PBHG 's blowout performance in 1999 and projected from it the most robust growth imaginable . It was what Old Mutual wanted to hear . By then many other insurers had obtained a U.S. " retail platform , " and Old Mutual had come to want one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Mutual actually agreed to buy all of UAM for $2 billion . Then , to secure maximum value from the firm it really coveted , Old Mutual made a separate deal with Pilgrim Baxter . It wanted to end UAM 's revenue-sharing arrangement with the firm , gaining access to every penny produced by the " crown jewel . " In return they would pay Harold Baxter and Gary Pilgrim $400 million . Sold , said the partners . Old Mutual got its U.S. retail platform in the worst way , all right . Pilgrim Baxter promptly went in the tank . The bear market mauled growth stocks particularly badly . When it did , Pilgrim Baxter was exposed for what it was-more a triumph of opportunism than a place of business . Its fortuitous success had arrested its institutional development . Burt Greenwald , the Philadelphia mutual funds veteran , was stunned when he did some consulting there for Old Mutual . " For an organization that was so successful in attracting assets , they had little , if any , business infrastructure , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paper clips . " Even more stark was the consequence of the firm 's failure to build up its fund-management capabilities . Gary Pilgrim 's QRS system , once his secret weapon , was n't updated and had become less sophisticated than rivals ' stock-screening systems . That is one reason why over the past three years PBHG Growth has fallen 28% , and its peers only 8% , according to Morningstar . Harold Baxter 's nepotism hurt , too , particularly as the pros left . The 8% annual loss average of Erin Finer , the now-departed PBHG Emerging Growth manager and Patty Baxter 's roommate , put her in the bottom 2% of such funds . Her fund had withered to $500,000 in assets from its $1.8 billion peak in 1997 . Can Pilgrim Baxter be put together again ? David Bullock , the new CEO , is trying to signal a new day . He has adopted a tough code of ethics for employees , tightly restricting their ability to trade any stocks in their PBHG portfolios . He has drawn up no-exceptions anti-timing rules , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Without a doubt , our priority is taking care of our shareholders , " he says . " The best way to respond to all this is to provide them quality investments and world-class service . " Funny how such cliches actually sound like radical manifestoes when uttered by the man who succeeded Harold Baxter . Baxter and Pilgrim resigned last November , just before the Spitzer and SEC suits . Life has not been good for them since , and not just because of their legal troubles . Baxter 's wife died of cancer in December . Pilgrim is in a state of shock , according to people who have been in touch with him . He never believed he was hurting PBHG 's investors . But that 's what happens when you become so distant from your customers , and that 's what mutual-fund firms everywhere had better learn from this sorry era . The money is the customer 's , and the profit motive is n't all . Sidebar " I love my family more than you love the air you breathe .
