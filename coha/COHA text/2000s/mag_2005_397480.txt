Section : 2006 Investment Guide Real Estate Thinking of picking up a photovoltaic panel ? Install it before the lavish tax subsidies expire . <p> A Front Porch With hanging flower baskets and stone-based columns softens the modern look of Bronwen and Jeffrey Martin 's 4,600-square-foot home in Mooresville , N.C. But in back there 's no confusing this $1.2 million structure with its more traditional neighbors : The rear south-facing glassy roof has two top rows of solar thermal panels that heat the house and its water and three bottom rows of solar photovoltaic panels that generate its electricity . " We have essentially locked in our future energy costs . And we can take hot showers forever , " boasts Jeff Martin , a 38-year-old senior program manager at Microsoft . Adding to his solar bliss : $17,500 in state tax credits . <p> Solar power is hotter than it has been since the 1970s . Only now the technology is better and the tax incentives fatter . Many states dish out money for these toys . Congress recently adopted the first federal tax breaks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed in 2006 or 2007 . You can claim one federal credit of up to $2,000 to cover 30% of a photovoltaic system 's cost and another 30% credit of up to $2,000 for a thermal system . These are credits  --  not deductions  --  so they reduce your tax bill dollar for dollar . <p> Catches ? The federal credit applies only to your net system cost after state incentives . Thermal systems used for heating hot tubs and pools are n't eligible . And there 's a chance you could lose your credit , or part of it , to the alternative minimum tax . So consult your accountant as well as a solar contractor before you decide whether to go solar . <p> Even with the federal break , the financial ( as opposed to the feel-good ) case for solar varies with latitude , utility rates and state subsidies . Over the course of a year the Southwest receives double the amount of solar energy that the Northeast does , but that usually translates into somewhat less than double the solar system output because the material converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures . Utility costs are widely skewed and can easily offset differences in climate . A photovoltaic system installed in Boston produces 25% less electricity than it would in Albuquerque , N.M . but yields the same savings on utility bills , since electricity costs more in Boston . ( The tips on page 194 will help you figure your own likely payoff . ) <p> Fifteen states , including Iowa , North Carolina and Oregon , offer tax breaks for solar energy . New York allows you to claim a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of solar thermal and photovoltaic systems , with a maximum credit of $3,750 . ( That increases to $5,000 on Sept. 1 , 2006 ) . The state exempts solar systems from sales tax and gives homeowners a 15-year real property tax exemption on the improvement . <p> In two dozen states , state or local governments offer direct solar rebates . Connecticut pays homeowners $5 per watt to install solar electricity  --  up to $25,000 for a 5-kilowatt photovoltaic system . ( As is customary , power is figured with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the sun goes down frequently . A 5kw system in Hartford will produce only 6,000 kilowatt-hours a year . ) That system would cost $37,800 . The state rebate reduces the cost to $12,800 . The federal break , assuming you can claim it , knocks the cost down to $10,800 . If the local utility charges 14 cents a kilowatt-hour and raises rates 5% a year , a family using 10,000 kilowatt-hours a year should recover its $10,800 investment in 11 years , calculates Thomas Leyden , a vice president of PowerLight , a photovoltaic project developer in Berkeley , Calif . ( The panels should last for at least 25 years . ) <p> In New Jersey you could recoup your investment in five years . In addition to a state $5.10-per-watt rebate and an exemption from the 6% sales tax , a New Jersey utility ( or a middleman broker ) will pay you 15 cents a kilowatt-hour for the " renewable energy credits " you earn as a solar energy producer  --  a subsidy worth $887 a year for our hypothetical family . This boondoggle comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities either draw a certain amount of their power from green sources or buy credits to meet their quotas . As more systems are put in , the market rate for credits could fall . <p> Even after all the breaks , upfront costs can be substantial , particularly if you 're set on being energy self-sufficient . The Martins in North Carolina spent $100,000 for a 10-kilowatt photovoltaic system and another $20,000 for the thermal system . ( A thermal system uses the sun 's rays to warm water , either for use at the tap or in a heating system . ) They also shelled out $10,000 for a geothermal heat pump system that provides cooling ( and back-up heating ) by using a deepwater well . Of course , they did n't make cost-saving a priority . Instead , working with noted Massachusetts architect/engineer Steven Strong ( who designed the solar energy systems at the White House ) , Jeff Martin wanted , he says , " a demonstration of what 's possible . " <p> If you 've got Martin 's green impulses but ca n't cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest system and rely more on conventional power as a backup . The most economic solar investment for an existing home is a system that heats water for your tap and costs $3,500 to $5,000 . Fluid runs through pipes that circle up to the solar roof panels . The hot fluid then transports heat back down to an 80-gallon water storage tank . ( The Martins , who use solar-heated water for central heating , too , have a 1,000-gallon tank in their cavernous basement . ) <p> A typical family of four uses 64 gallons of hot tap water a day . If you buy a $4,500 solar water heating system in North Carolina , the net cost after state and federal credits is $2,170 . If gas averages $20 per million Btu and the solar system cuts your gas use by 15 million Btu a year , the system pays for itself in seven years . You 'll want to keep your old electric or gas system in place as a backup . <p> The federal $2,000 credit by itself does n't make a big dent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll need a generous state incentive to make that investment pay off . How much do you care about aesthetics ? Those old-fashioned , clunky panels that sit in your yard or on your roof are cheaper than the sleek , roof-integrated panels the Martins chose or new ones that double as windows . <p> The Martins set up their system so that it fulfills most of their electricity demands over the course of the year . A bank of batteries in their basement stores power for when the sun does n't shine and the power grid is n't available . The excess that they ca n't use or store is sold to the local power grid . Under a statewide program they get 18 cents a kilowatt-hour for the power they put on the grid , which is then resold to other consumers who are willing to pay 12 cents a kilowatt-hour ( 4 cents more than the normal rate there ) to buy a mix of green power that includes pricey solar and cheaper wind and methane energy . The Martins could even engineer their system to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents and then buy back fossil-fuel power at 8 cents , pocketing the difference . Of course , it would be cynical to play arbitrage games like that , but then legislators were inviting such mischief when they decided to subsidize something that does n't quite make economic sense .
