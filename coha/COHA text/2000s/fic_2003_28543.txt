Chapter One Sara Crawford entered her office at precisely eight-thirty on Monday morning , walked halfway across the plum-colored carpet and stopped dead . " Whatever that is , it ca n't be good , " she muttered . " Especially this close to tax deadline . " The red-and-white Federal Express envelope on top of her desk had all the appeal of a hurricane warning flag on a Fort Lauderdale beach . Tossing her purse and briefcase on a chair , she headed for the chrome credenza lining one wall . Before she could even think about tackling the contents of the package , she needed to deal with the coffee machine . A crusty brown stain in the bottom of the glass pot did more to irritate her than her assistant being late again . Sara carried the pot into her bathroom , dribbled a few drops of detergent over the burned-on mess and filled the pot with steaming hot water . Then she sat at her desk and picked up the cardboard envelope addressed to Sara Crawford , CPA . It was n't particularly thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tax records . Nor was the return address familiar : Herbert Adams , Attorney , Cleveland , Ohio . Puzzled but relieved , she reached for her letter opener . " Oh , hell ! Look at the time . " Candy Applebaum 's oath came from the reception room just before the administrative assistant stuck her head in Sara 's office . Her red hair was piled on top of her head , secured by a bright orange elastic band that did nothing to prevent over-moussed strands from sticking out in all directions . " I 'm so sorry I 'm late , Sara , " Candy said . " I almost made it on time , except I had one catastrophe after another this morning . My cat climbed on the table and swatted at the birdcage . The feed tray fell out of the rungs and all the bird seed went everywhere , and I had to ... " Sara smiled . " It 's all right , Candy . I just got here myself . " Candy glanced at the credenza and grimaced . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn off the coffeepot . Was it really gross ? " " Well , it - " " No problem . I 'll take care of it . " Candy headed for the bathroom , but stopped at Sara 's desk and dropped a crumpled sack onto the cluttered surface . " Before I forget , this just came for you . Mr. Papalardo delivered it personally . " She sighed as she went into the bathroom . " He 's the sweetest man . " Sara set down the FedEx envelope and stared in horror at the brown paper bag . He 'd done it again . After she 'd warned him repeatedly , he pulled the same trick every year . She could just picture the world 's " sweetest man " waiting on the sidewalk until she 'd entered the building and then slinking inside . The security guard would greet him cheerfully . The janitor would wave hello . After all , everyone loved Tony Papalardo . A dull ache centered itself behind Sara 's eyes . She picked up the bag and turned it over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't . Bundles of paper loosely bound with rubber bands and paper clips scattered onto her desktop . Some scraps were actually identified with official Pappy 's Pizzeria stationery . Most of them were barely legible receipts smudged with tomato sauce or memos scratched on chianti-stained napkins . Sara put her head between her hands . " Something wrong , Sara ? " A rhetorical question . " Candy , do you think Mr. Papalardo has any idea that he 's not my only client and today is April twelfth ? Only three days to the deadline . " Glancing over her shoulder at the mess on Sara 's desk , Candy said , " Oh , not again . Do n't worry . I 'll help you . " " Thanks . " Sara glanced toward a pewter mirror across the room . She could almost visualize herself tugging every pin from her French twist and pulling out each strand of blond hair by the root . But she did n't have time . Instead , she picked up Tony Papalardo 's paper bag and crushed it in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in five days , Candy , " she said . " Nothing is going to stop me from getting on that plane to Aruba . I 'm really leaving . " Candy grinned with delight . " Well , of course you are , Sara . And you 'll have a wonderful time . Is n't that new guy you 've been dating part of the group ? " Sara answered with caution , knowing where the question was leading . Candy was always trying to secure a happily-ever-after for her boss . " Yes , Donald is going , but do n't jump to conclusions . We 've only had four dates . " " Okay , but when you two stroll along those moonlit beaches , who knows what will happen ? " Sara shook her head and laughed . " You 're incorrigible . " The phone rang in the outer office , and Candy scurried to answer it while Sara picked through the pile of pizzeria flotsam . She was interrupted when her intercom buzzed . " Yes , Candy . " " It 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said you 'd be expecting his call . " Cleveland ? Of course . the envelope . Sara reached for the FedEx package with one hand and grabbed the phone with the other . " Hello , Mr. Adams ? This is Sara Crawford . I 'm sorry . I have n't had a chance to open what you sent . I have it right here , though . " The voice on the other end was crisp and competent . " Miss Crawford , I was Millicent Thorne 's attorney . " It took a moment for the name to register , but when it did , Sara smiled . She had n't seen her mother 's Aunt Millie for fifteen years , since the summer she 'd turned fourteen - the summer her mother died . But she remembered the disciplined woman with her sensible shoes and pearl-buttoned cardigan sweaters . " Of course , " she said . " How is Aunt Millie ? " There was a pause . " You do n't know ? " " Know what ? " " Miss Thorne passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millicent Thorne a half-dozen times in her life . Millie traveled a great deal , and Sara had been busy with school activities . Still , the news of her death sent a wave of sadness through her . Mr. Adams , a stranger , called to tell her that a member of her family had died , a woman she barely knew . There ought to be a sin covering this kind of situation . The sin of missed opportunities because at this moment Sara did indeed feel as if she 'd let some part of her life slip away , and there was no way to get it back . " I 'm sorry . I did n't know . " " I 'm aware that you and Miss Thorne were never close . " " How did she die , Mr. Adams ? " " Peacefully in her sleep , and she wanted for nothing . Your aunt lived comfortably , thanks to a lawsuit she won a few years ago . Her last years were spent in relative luxury . " " I 'm glad of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate , " Mr. Adams said , " and a will that clearly stipulated her wishes . She had a good many friends and helpful neighbors , whom she remembered in her will . And she remembered you , Miss Crawford . " " Me ? Why me ? I hardly knew her . " Sara 's headache intensified . " I ca n't accept an inheritance , Mr. Adams . If it 's money , perhaps you could arrange for one of Miss Thorne 's charities - " " It 's not money , Miss Crawford . It 's Thorne-family property , and Miss Thorne very definitely wanted you to have it . She said she remembered you as a levelheaded girl . She thought you could manage it quite well .
