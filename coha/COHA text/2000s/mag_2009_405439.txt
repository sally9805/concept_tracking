Judge and Jury Re TIME 's cover package on Sonia Sotomayor June 8 : I fully agree with Sotomayor 's 2001 statement that she " would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life . " It is entirely possible for two jurists to arrive at an identical conclusion in a case , yet if one of them has considered more options and deliberated more over the issues , that jurist will have made the " wiser , more informed " decision . Sotomayor 's background will automatically strengthen her consideration of legal issues -- something that will escape some other jurist who has not had the experience of being a minority . Kerman Bharucha , WEBSTER , N.Y . I 'm amazed by the double standard being used for Sotomayor . George W. Bush suspends constitutional rights to catch terrorists and is labeled evil and un-American . Sotomayor suspends constitutional rights to catch sex offenders and is said to be " empathetic " to the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore constitutional rights ? Bryan Smith , TUCSON , ARIZ . Re Christopher Caldwell 's " The Limits of Empathy " : Claiming that Sotomayor " ignored a host of pressing constitutional issues " when deciding against the plaintiffs in the New Haven , Conn. , case is a gross misrepresentation of reality . In fact , the judges went along with current , established constitutional law intended to prevent discriminatory criteria . An appeals court should not overturn Supreme Court rulings lightly . It would have been judicial activism to ignore precedent and decide in the plaintiffs ' favor . Cinny Wong , AUSTIN , TEXAS Chasing the European Model In " New Lessons from the Old World , " one critical lesson on health care was omitted June 8 . Europe does not have for-profit health insurance . The U.S. will never truly reform health care as long as we treat it as a commodity . Here , as they do in the European Union , we should recognize health care as a basic human right . Warren Swanson , REDDING , CALIF . Thank Heaven for Gates Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Robert Gates June 8 . Finally , someone who is putting the troops first . Jack Quartaroli , SACRAMENTO , CALIF . Gates is a pragmatic professional . Al-Qaeda had already committed four separate acts of war against the U.S. before George W. Bush was sworn in . The ideology-based policy of that incoming Administration downgraded the project to " get bin Laden , " so FBI information about suspicious flying lessons stayed in the field until after 9/11 . If counterterrorism adviser Richard Clarke had had such intel when it was fresh , there might have been time to figure out the plot and forestall the attacks . Novelist Tom Clancy , after all , published the idea in 1994 Unlike the rest of the Bush Administration , Gates -- the best Secretary of Defense since George C. Marshall , if not ever -- has kept us safe since being sworn in . David P. Vernon , TUCSON , ARIZ . Mr. Hilton Should Regret TIME could have found someone more deserving of magazine space than Perez Hilton June 8 . Hilton makes his living humiliating people for entertainment . On top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a beauty contest to sabotage a contestant 's shot at the crown because she had the nerve to have her own opinion and , even worse , share it . Dave Avanzino , FULLERTON , CALIF . Please recycle this magazine and remove inserts or samples before recycling PULLQUOTE ' Apparently Perez Hilton loses sight of the very tolerance he advocates when it does n't suit his agenda . ' Michael Kissel HUNTINGTON BEACH , CALIF . BOX CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW ? LETTER FROM A LATINA Christopher Caldwell 's " Viewpoint " on Judge Sonia Sotomayor and affirmative action reflected a lack of insight June 8 . I was the only Latina in my medical-school class and had no other college graduate in my family . My feeling of being alien , that others had upbringings that better prepared them for their future , helped create a special sort of empathy in me . Having graduated a few weeks ago , I understand , in a way Caldwell will never be able to , that the stories of President Obama , Sotomayor and myself are possible only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such policies ensure that any American , regardless of social status or race , is able to achieve the American Dream .
