// Dear Dr. Cory : I am worried about my eyesight . It is very poor , and I do n't know what to do . It may be because I read too many books . What should I do ? Jessica Arkansas Dear Jessica : Reading a lot of books will not cause poor eyesight . However , if reading books tires your eyes easily , then you need to visit your eye doctor . Trouble seeing , blurry vision , and headaches may be signs that you are having vision problems . Glasses can often help correct vision problems . Prevent Blindness America recommends that all children have their eyes examined by an eyecare professional shortly after birth , at six months of age , before entering school ( age four or five ) , and at least every other year during primary school years . // If you notice that you have any of the following eye problems , please visit your eye doctor as soon as possible : * squinting * needing to shut or cover one eye in order to see clearly * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W or computer * having to hold a book close to your face * holding your head at an angle when looking at something * frequent headaches , nausea , tiredness , or burning eyes , especially after reading or doing close work * using a finger to help guide your reading * losing your place while reading // Dear Dr. Cory : My grandma wears a copper bracelet . She says it helps the pain in her thumb joint . How can a copper bracelet help her pain ? Wendy Pennsylvania Dear Wendy : Research on the effects of these bracelets has not proven that they are helpful , but neither have we found research proving that they are not . Copper bracelets have been said to help relieve the pain by neutralizing free radicals ( toxic molecules that damage cells ) as the copper is absorbed through the skin . However , studies have noted that the skin can not begin to absorb the amount of copper needed to have such an effect , especially when many of the bracelets have lacquered surfaces that prevent the skin from absorbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon wearing the bracelets has more to do with the natural coming and going of the pain associated with this disease . The Arthritis Foundation suggests instead that people get their antioxidants , such as vitamin C , from foods or vitamins . Dear Dr. Cory : What is the definition of a tetnes shot , and how do you spell it ? Aharon Pennsylvania Dear Dr. Cory : How often do you need a tetanus shot ?
