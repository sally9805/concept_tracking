David Moles says be was bom on the anniversary of the RlOl disaster , which means this issue will come off the presses shortly after bis birthday . He has lived on three continents , with Europe ( specifically , Switzerland ) serving as home these days . His short stories and verse have appeared in Asimov 's , Polyphony , Rabid Transit , and Strange Horizons , among others . He also co-edited ( with different coeditors ) both Twenty Epics and All-Star Zeppelin Adventure Stories , and he says the inspiration for " Finisterra " was an illustration by the cover artist for those two anthologies , Lara Wells . Her Vermeer-influenced piece depicting a woman surrounded by airship design drawings and models of ornithopters immediately conjured up this story 's protagonist . <p> 1 . ENCANTADA BIANCA NAZARIO STANDS at the end of the world . The firmament above is as blue as the summer skies of her childhood , mirrored in the waters of la caldera- , but where the skies she remembers were bounded by mountains , here on Sky there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The white line shades into a diffuse grayish fog that , as Bianca looks down , grows progressively murkier , until the sky directly below is thoroughly dark and opaque . She remembers what Dinh told her about the ways Sky could kill her . With a large enough parachute , Bianca imagines , she could fall for hours , drifting through the layered clouds , before finding her end in heat or pressure or the jaws of some monstrous denizen of the deep air . If this should go wrong , Bianca can not imagine a better way to die . Bianca works her way out a few hundred meters along the base of one of Encantada 's ventral fins , stopping when the dry red dirt beneath her feet begins to give way to scarred gray flesh . She takes a last look around : at the pall of smoke obscuring the zaiatan 's tree-lined dorsal ridge , at the fin she stands on , curving out and down to its delicate-looking tip , kilometers away . Then she knots her scarf around her skirted ankles and shrugs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabricators . As the harness tightens itself around her , she takes a deep breath , filling her lungs . The wind from the burning camp smells of wood smoke and pine resin , enough to overwhelm the taint of blood from the killing ground . Blessed Virgin , she prays , be my witness : this is no suicide . This is a prayer for a miracle . She leans forward . She falls . 2 . THE FLYING ARCHIPELAGO The boat-like anemopter that Valadez had sent for them had a cruising speed of just less than the speed of sound , which in this part of Sky 's atmosphere meant about nine hundred kilometers per hour . The speed , Bianca thought , might have been calculated to bring home the true size of Sky , the impossible immensity of it . It had taken the better part of their first day 's travel for the anemopter 's point of departure , the tenkilometer , billion-ton vacuum balloon Transient Meridian , to drop from sight - the dwindling golden droplet disappearing , not over the horizon , but into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clouds visible through the subtle blurring of the anemopter 's static fields covered an area about the size of North America . She heard a plastic clattering on the deck behind her and turned to see one of the anemopter 's crew , a globular , brown-furred alien with a collection of arms like furry snakes , each arm tipped with a mouth or a round and curious eye . The ftzija were low-gravity creatures ; the ones Bianca had seen on her passage from Earth had tumbled joyously through the Caliph of Baghdad 's inner ring spaces like so many radially symmetrical monkeys . The three aboard the anemopter , in Sky 's heavier gravity , had to make do with spindly-legged walking machines . There was a droop in their arms that was both comical and melancholy . " Come forward , " this one told Bianca in fractured Arabic , its voice like an ensemble of reed pipes . She thought it was the one that called itself Ismail . " Make see archipelago . " She followed it forward to the anernopter 's rounded prow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting his elbows on the rail , looking down . " Pictures do n't do them justice , do they ? " he said . Bianca went to the rail and followed the naturalist 's gaze . She did her best to maintain a certain stiff formality around Fry ; from their fust meeting aboard Transient Meridian she 'd had the idea that it might not be good to let him get too familiar . But when she saw what Fry was looking at , the mask slipped for a moment ; she could n't help a sharp , quick intake of breath . Fry chuckled . " To stand on the back of one , " he said , " to stand in a valley and look up at the hills and know that the ground under your feet is supported by the bones of a living creature - there 's nothing else like it . " He shook his head . At this altitude they were above all but the highest-flying of the thousands of beasts that made up Septentrionalis Archipelago . Bianca 's eyes tried to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into other things : a chain of islands , yes , if she concentrated on the colors , the greens and browns of forests and plains , the grays and whites of the snowy highlands , a fleet of ships , perhaps , if she instead focused on the individual shapes , the keel ridges , the long , translucent fins , ribbed like Chinese sails . The zaratanes of the archipelago were more different from one another than the members of a flock of birds or a pod of whales , but still there was a symmetry , a regularity of form , the basic anatomical plan equal parts fish and mountain - repeated throughout , in fractal detail from the great old shape of Zaratn Finisterra , a hundred kilometers along the dorsal ridge , down to the merely hill-sized bodies of the nameless younger beasts . When she took in the archipelago as a whole , it was impossible for Bianca not to see the zaiatanes as living things . " Nothing else like it , " Fry repeated . Bianca turned reluctantly from the view to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami accent , courtesy , he 'd said , of a Consilium language module . Bianca was finding it hard to judge the ages of extraados , particularly the men , but in Fry 's case she thought he might be ten years older than Bianca 's own forty , and unwilling to admit it - or ten years younger , and in the habit of treating himself very badly . On her journey here she 'd met cyborgs and foreigners and artificial intelligences and several sorts of alien - some familiar , at least from media coverage of the hajj , and some strange-but the extranados bothered her the most . It was hard to come to terms with the idea of humans born off Earth , humans who had never been to Earth or even seen it ; humans who often had no interest in it . " Why did you leave here , Mr. Fry ? " she asked . Fry laughed . " Because I did n't want to spend the rest of my life out here . " With a hand , he swept the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on end , with no one but researchers and feral refugees to talk to , nowhere to go for fun but some slum of a balloon station , nothing but a thousand kilometers of air between you and Hell ? " He laughed again . " You 'd leave , too , Nazario , believe me . " " Maybe I would , " Bianca said . " But you 're back . " " I 'm here for the money , " Fry said . " Just like you . " Bianca smiled and said nothing . " You know , " Fry said after a little while , " they have to kill the zaiatanes to take them out of here . " He looked at Bianca and smiled , in a way that was probably meant to be ghoulish . " There 's no atmosphere ship big enough to lift a zaiatan in one piece - even a small one . The poachers deflate them - gut them - flatten them out and roll them up . And even then , they throw out almost everything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mused . Her mask was back in place . " There was a packet of material on the zaiatanes with my contract ; I watched most of it on the voyage . According to the packet , the Consilium considers the zaiatanes a protected species . " Fry looked uneasy . Now it was Bianca 's turn to chuckle . " Do n't worry , Mr. Fry , " she said . " I may not know exactly what it is Mr. Valadez is paying me to do , but I 've never had any illusion that it was legal . " Behind her , the firija made a fluting noise that might have been laughter . 3 . THE STEEL BIRD When Bianca was a girl , the mosque of Punta Aguila was the most prominent feature in the view from her fourth-floor window , a sixteenth-century structure of tensegrity cables and soaring catenary curves , its spreading white wings vaguely - but only vaguely - recalling the bird that gave the city its name . The automation that controlled the tension of the cables and adjusted the mosque 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables themselves , and was very old . Once , after the hurricane in the time of Bianca 's grandfather , it had needed adjusting , and the old men of the ayuntamiento had been forced to send for extrafiado technicians , at an expense so great that the jizyah of Bianca 's time was still paying for it . But Bianca rarely thought of that . Instead she would spend long hours surreptitiously sketching those white wings , calculating the weight of the structure and the tension of the cables , wondering what it would take to make the steel bird fly . Bianca 's father could probably have told her , but she never dared to ask . Raul Nazario de Arenas was an aeronautical engineer , like the seven generations before him , and flight was the Nazarios " fortune ; fully a third of the aircraft that plied the skies over the Rio Picaro were types designed by Raul or bis father or his wife 's father , on contract to the great moro trading and manufacturing families that were Punta Aguila 's truly wealthy . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian , Raul Nazario would never be as wealthy as the men who employed him , but his profession was an ancient and honorable one , providing his family with a more than comfortable living . If Raul Nazario de Arenas thought of the mosque at all , it was only to mutter about the jizyah from time to time - but never loudly , because the Nazarios , like the other Christians of Punta Aguila , however valued , however ancient their roots , knew that they lived there only on sufferance . But Bianca would sketch the aircraft , too , the swift gliders and lumbering flying boats and stately dirigibles , and these drawings she did not have to hide ; in fact for many years her father would encourage her , explaining this and that aspect of their construction , gently correcting errors of proportion and balance in Bianca 's drawings ; would let her listen in while he taught the family profession to her brothers , Jesus the older , Pablo the younger . This lasted until shortly before Bianca 's quinceanera , when Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , and Bianca 's mother delivered a lecture concerning the difference between what was proper for a child and what was proper for a young Christian woman with hopes of one day making a good marriage . It was only a handful of years later that Bianca 's father died , leaving a teenaged Pablo at the helm of his engineering business ; and only Bianca 's invisible assistance and the pity of a few old clients had kept contracts and money coming into the Nazario household . By the time Pablo was old enough to think he could run the business himself , old enough to marry the daughter of a musical instrument maker from Tierra Ceniza , their mother was dead , Bianca was thirty , and even if her dowry had been half her father 's business , there was not a Christian man in Rio Picaro who wanted it , or her . And then one day Pablo told her about the extianado contract that had been brought to the ayuntamiento , a contract that the ayuntamiento and the Guild had together forbidden the Christian engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeronautical engineer to travel a very long way from Rio Picaro and be paid a very large sum of money indeed . Three months later Bianca was in Quito , boarding an elevator car . In her valise was a bootleg copy of her father 's engineering system , and a contract with the factor of a starship called the Caliph of Baghdad , for passage to Sky . 4 . THE KILLING GROUND The anemopter 's destination was a zaiatan called Encantada , smaller than the giant Finisterra but still nearly forty kilometers from nose to tail , and eight thousand meters from gray-white keel to forested crest . From a distance of a hundred kilometers , Encantada was like a forested mountain rising from a desert plain , the clear air under its keel as dreamlike as a mirage . On her pocket system , Bianca called up pictures from Sky 's network of the alpine ecology that covered the hills and valleys of Encantada 's flanks : hardy grasses and small warm-blooded creatures and tall evergreens with spreading branches , reminding her of the pines and redwoods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century or so Encantada had been keeping company with Zaratn Finisterra , holding its position above the larger beast 's eastern flank . No one , apparently , knew the reason . Fry being the expert , Bianca had expected him to at least have a theory . He did n't even seem interested in the question . " They 're beasts , Nazario , " he said . " They do n't do things for reasons . We only call them animals and not plants because they bleed when we cut them . " They were passing over Finisterra 's southern slopes . Looking down , Bianca saw brighter , warmer greens , more shades than she could count , more than she had known existed , the green threaded through with bright ribbons of silver water . She saw the anemopter 's shadow , a dark oblong that rode the slopes and ridges , ringed by brightness - the faint reflection of Sky 's sun behind them . And just before the shadow entered the larger darkness that was the shadow of Encantada , Bianca watched it ride over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungle , a suspiciously geometric collection of shapes that could only be buildings , the smudge of chimney smoke . " Fry - " she started to say . Then the village , if that 's what it was , was gone , hidden behind the next ridge . " What ? " said Fry . " I saw - I thought I saw - " " People ? " asked Fry . " You probably did . " " But I thought Sky did n't have any native sentients . Who are they ? " " Humans , mostly , " Fry said . " Savages . Refugees . Drug farmers . Five generations of escaped criminals , and their kids , and their kids . " The naturalist shrugged . " Once in a while , if the Consilium 's looking for somebody in particular , the wardens might stage a raid , just for show . The rest of the time , the wardens fly their dope , screw their women ... and otherwise leave them alone . " " But where do they come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another shrug . " Humans have been in this part of space for a long , long time . This is one of those places people end up , you know ? People with nowhere else to go . People who ca n't fall any farther . " Bianca shook her head and said nothing . The poacher camp on Encantada 's eastern slope was invisible until they were almost upon it , hidden from the wardens " satellite eyes by layers of projected camouflage . Close up , the illusion seemed flat , its artificiality obvious , but it was still not until the anemopter passed through the projection that the camp itself could be seen : a clear-cut swath a kilometer wide and three times as long , stretching from the lower slopes of Encantada 's dorsal ridge down to the edge of the zaratan 's cliff-like flank . Near the edge , at one corner , there was a small cluster of prefabricated bungalows ; but at first it seemed to Bianca that most of the space was wasted . Then she saw the red churned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the shape of the terrain suggested the imprint of a gigantic , elongated body . The open space was for killing . " Sky is very poor , Miss Nazario , " said Valadez , over his shoulder . The poacher boss looked to be about fifty , stocky , his hair still black and his olive skin well-tanned but pocked with tiny scars . His Spanish was a dialect Bianca had never heard before , strange and lush , its vowels rich , its lis breathy as Bianca 's /s , its /s warm and liquid as the ys of an Argentine . When he said fuck your mother - and already , in the hour or so Bianca had been in the camp , she had heard him say it several times , though never yet to her - the madie came out madri . About half of the poachers were human , but Valadez seemed to be the only one who spoke Spanish natively ; the rest used Sky 's dialect of bazaar Arabic . Valadez spoke that as well , better than Bianca did , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life . If he had a first name , he was keeping it to himself . " There are things on Sky that people want , " Valadez went on . " But the people of Sky have nothing of interest to anybody . The companies that mine the deep air pay some royalties . But mostly what people live on here is Consilium handouts . " The four of them - Bianca , Fry , and the firija , Ismal , who as well as being an anemopter pilot seemed to be Valadez 's servant or business partner or bodyguard , or perhaps all three-were climbing the ridge above the poachers " camp . Below them workers , some human , some firija , a handful of other species , were setting up equipment : mobile machines that looked like they belonged on a construction site , pipes and cylindrical tanks reminiscent of a brewery or a refinery . " I 'm changing that , Miss Nazario . " Valadez glanced over his shoulder at Bianca . " Off-world , there are people - like Ismal 's people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the idea of living on a floating island , and have the money to pay for one . " He swept an arm , taking in the camp , the busy teams of workers . " With that money , I take boys out of the shantytowns of Sky 's balloon stations and elevator gondolas . I give them tools , and teach them to kill beasts . " To stop me-since they ca n't be bothered to do it themselves-the Consilium takes the same boys , gives them guns , and teaches them to kill men . " The poacher stopped and turned to face Bianca , jamming his hands into the pockets of his coat . " Tell me , Miss Nazario - is one worse than the other ? " " I 'm not here to judge you , Mr. Valadez , " said Bianca . " I 'm here to do a job . " Valadez smiled . " So you are . " He turned and continued up the slope . Bianca and the firija followed , Fry trailing behind . The path switchbacked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way to taller varieties , including some that Bianca would have sworn were ordinary pines and firs . She breathed deeply , enjoying the alpine breeze after the crowds-and-machines reek of Transient Meridian 's teeming slums , the canned air of ships and anemopters . " It smells just like home , " she remarked . " Why is that ? " No one answered . The ridge leveled off . They came out into a cleared space , overlooking the camp . Spread out below them Bianca saw the airfield , the globular tanks and pipes of the poachers " little industrial plant , the bungalows in the distance-and , in between , the red-brown earth of the killing ground , stretching out to the cliff-edge and the bases of the nearest translucent fins . " This is a good spot , " Valadez declared . " Should be a good view from up here . " " A view of what ? " said Fry . The poacher did n't answer . He waved to Ismal , and the firija took a small folding stool out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinuous arms and setting it down behind him . Valadez sat . After a moment , the answer to Fry 's question came up over the edge . Bianca had not thought much at all about the killing of a zaiatan , and when she had thought of it she had imagined something like the harpooning of a whale in ancient times , the great beast fleeing , pursued by the tiny harassing shapes of boats , gored by harpoons , sounding again and again , all the strength bleeding out of the beast until there was nothing left for it to do but wallow gasping on the surface and expire , noble and tragic . Now Bianca realized that for all their great size , the zaiatanes were far weaker than any whale , far less able to fight or to escape or even - she sincerely hoped - to understand what was happening to them . There was nothing noble about the way the nameless zaiatan died . Anemopters landed men and aliens with drilling tools at the base of each hundred-meter fin , to bore through soil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled them . This took about fifteen minutes ; and to Bianca there seemed to be something obscene in the way the paralyzed fins hung there afterward , lifeless and limp . Thus crippled , the beast was pushed and pulled by aerial tugs - awkward machines , stubby and cylindrical , converted from the stationkeeping engines of vacuum balloons like Transient Meridian-into position over Encantada 's killing ground . Then the drilling teams moved in again , to the places marked for them ahead of time by seismic sensors and ultrasound , cutting this time through bone as well as flesh , to find the zaratan 's brain . When the charges the drilling teams had planted went off , a ripple went through the zaratan 's body , a slow-motion convulsion that took nearly a minute to travel down the body 's long axis , as the news of death passed from synapse to synapse ; and Bianca saw flocks of birds started from the trees along the zaratan 's back as if by an earthquake , which in a way she supposed this was . The carcass immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bianca realized , of sphincters relaxing one by one , all along the zaiatan 's length , venting hydrogen from the ballonets . Then the forward edge of the keel fin hit the ground and crumpled , and the whole length of the dead beast , a hundred thousand tons of it , crashed down into the field ; and even at that distance Bianca could hear the cracking of gargantuan bones . She shivered , and glanced at her pocket system . The whole process , she was amazed to see , had taken less than half an hour . " That 's this trip paid for , whatever else happens , " said Valadez . He turned to Bianca . " Mostly , though , I thought you should see this . Have you guessed yet what it is I 'm paying you to do , Miss Nazario ? " Bianca shook her head . " Clearly you do n't need an aeronautical engineer to do what you 've just done . " She looked down at the killing ground , where men and aliens and machines were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeling back skin and soil in great strips like bleeding boulevards . A wind had come up , blowing from the killing ground across the camp , bringing with it a smell that Bianca associated with butcher shops . An engineering problem , she reminded herself , as she turned her back on the scene and faced Valadez . That 's all this is . " How are you going to get it out of here ? " she asked . " Cargo-lifter , " said Valadez . " The Lupita Jerz . A supply ship , diverted from one of the balloon stations . " The alien , Ismal , said : " Like fly anemopter make transatmospheric . " The same fluting voice and broken Arabic . " Lifter plenty payload mass limit , but fly got make have packaging . Packaging for got make platform have stable . " On the word packaging thefiiija 's arms made an expressive gesture , like rolling something up into a bundle and tying it . Bianca nodded hesitantly , hoping she understood . " And so you can only take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because there 's only one place on Sky you 'll find a stable platform that size : on the back of another zaratn . " " You have the problem in a nutshell , Miss Nazario , " said Valadez . " Now , how would you solve it ? How would you bag , say , Encantada here ? How would you bag Finisterra ? " Fry said : " You want to take one alive ? " His face was even more pale than usual . Bianca noticed that he , too , had turned his back to the killing ground . Valadez was still looking at Bianca , expectantly . " He does n't want it alive , Mr. Fry , " she said , watching the poacher . " He wants it dead - but intact . You could take even Finisterra apart , and lift it piece by piece , but you 'd need a thousand cargo-lifters to do it . " Valadez smiled . " I 've got another ship , " he said . " Built for deep mining , outfitted as a mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated for atmosphere , but if you can get one of the big ones to the edge of space , we 'll lower the skyhook , catch the beast , and catapult it into orbit . The buyer 's arranged an FTL tug to take it from there . " Bianca made herself look back at the killing ground . The workers were freeing the bones , lifting them with aerial cranes and feeding them into the plant ; for cleaning and preservation , she supposed . She turned back to Valadez . " We should be able to do that , if the zaratn 's body will stand up to the low pressure , " she said . " But why go to all this trouble ? I 've seen the balloon stations . I 've seen what you people can do with materials . How hard can it be to make an imitation zaiatn ? " Valadez glanced at Ismail . The walker was facing the killing ground , but two of the alien 's many eyes were watching the sky - and two more were watching Valadez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one thing , Miss Nazario ; the real thing is something else . And worth a lot more , to the right buyer . " He looked away again ; not at Ismail this time , but up the slope , through the trees . " Besides , " he added , " in this case I 've got my own reasons . " " Ship come , " Ismal announced . Bianca looked and saw more of the firija 's eyes turning upward . She followed their gaze . At first she saw only empty sky . Then the air around the descending Lupita Jerz boiled into contrails , outlining the invisible ovoid shape of the ship 's lifting fields . " Time to get to work , " said Valadez . Bianca glanced toward the killing ground . A pink fog was rising to cover the work of the flensing crews . The air was full of blood . 5 . THE AERONAUTS Valadez 's workers cleaned the nameless zaratn 's bones one by one ; they tanned the hide , and rolled it into bundles for loading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , was the cleanest part of the work . What occupied most of the workers was the disposal of the unwanted parts , a much dirtier and more arduous job . Exotic internal organs the size of houses ; tendons like braided , knotted bridge cables ; ballonets large enough , each of them , to lift an ordinary dirigible ; and hectares and hectares of pale , dead flesh . The poachers piled up the mess with earth-moving machines and shoveled it off the edge of the killing ground , a rain of offal falling into the clouds in a mist of blood , manna for the ecology of the deep air . They sprayed the killing ground with antiseptics , and the cool air helped to slow decay a little , but by the fourth day the butcher-shop smell had nonetheless given way to something worse . Bianca 's bungalow was one of the farthest out , only a few dozen meters from Encantada 's edge , where the wind blew in from the open eastern sky , and she could turn her back on the slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , distant shapes of younger zaratanes . Even here , though , a kilometer and more upwind of the killing ground , the air carried a taint of spoiled meat . The sky was full of insects and scavenger birds , and there were always vermin underfoot . Bianca spent most of her time indoors , where the air was filtered and the wet industrial sounds of the work muted . The bungalow was outfitted with all the mechanisms the extranados used to make themselves comfortable , but while in the course of her journey Bianca had learned to operate these , she made little use of them . Besides her traveling chest - a gift from her older brother 's wife , which served as armoire , desk , dresser , and drafting table - the only furnishings were a woven carpet in the Lagos Grandes style , a hard little bed , and a single wooden chair , not very different from the ones in her room in Punta Aguila . Of course those had been handmade , and these were simulations provided by the bungalow 's machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projected spaces of Bianca 's engineering work . The tools Valadez had given her were slick and fast and factory-fresh , the state of somebody 's art , somewhere ; but what Bianca mostly found herself using was her pocket system 's crippled copy of the Nazario family automation . The system Bianca 's father used to use , to calculate stresses in fabric and metal and wood , to model the flow of air over wings and the variation of pressure and temperature through gasbags , was six centuries old , a slow , patient , reliable thing that dated from before the founding of the London Caliphate . It had aged along with the family , grown used to their quirks and to the strange demands of aviation in Rio Pcaro . Bianca 's version of it , limited though it was , at least did n't balk at control surfaces supported by muscle and bone , at curves not aerodynamically smooth but fractally complex with grasses and trees and hanging vines . If the zaratanes had been machines , they would have been marvels of engineering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservoir-sized ballast bladders full of collected rainwater , their great delicate fins . The zaratanes were beyond the poachers " systems " stubborn , narrow-minded comprehension ; for all their speed and flash , the systems sulked like spoiled children whenever Bianca tried to use them to do something their designers had not expected her to do . Which she was doing , all the time . She was working out how to draw up Leviathan with a hook . " Miss Nazario . " Bianca started . She had yet to grow used to these extranado telephones that never rang , but only spoke to her out of the air , or perhaps out of her own head . " Mr. Valadez , " she said , after a moment . " Whatever you 're doing , drop it , " said Valadez 's voice . " You and Fry . I 'm sending a " mopter for you . " " I 'm working , " said Bianca . " I do n't know what Fry 's doing . " " This is work , " said Valadez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the silence told Bianca that Valadez had hung up . She sighed ; then stood , stretched , and started to braid her hair . The anemopter brought them up over the dorsal ridge , passing between two of the great translucent fins . At this altitude , Encantada 's body was clear of vegetation ; Bianca looked down on hectares of wind-blasted gray hide , dusted lightly with snow . They passed within a few hundred meters of one of the huge spars that anchored the after fin 's leading edge : a kilometers-high pillar of flesh , teardrop in cross-section and at least a hundred meters thick . The trailing edge of the next fin , by contrast , flashed by in an instant . Bianca had only a brief impression of a silk-supple membrane , veined with red , clear as dirty glass . " What do you think he wants ? " Fry asked . " I do n't know . " She nodded her head toward the firija behind them at the steering console . " Did you ask the pilot ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic . " Bianca shrugged . " I suppose we 'll find out soon enough . " Then they were coming down again , down the western slope . In front of Bianca was the dorsal ridge of Zaratn Finisterra . Twenty kilometers away and blue with haze , it nonetheless rose until it seemed to cover a third of the sky . Bianca looked out at it , wondering again what kept Encantada and Finisterra so close ; but then the view was taken away and they were coming down between the trees , into a shady , ivy-filled creekbed somewhere not far from Encantada 's western edge . There was another anemopter already there , and a pair of aerial tugs - and a whitish mass that dwarfed all of these , sheets and ribbons of pale material hanging from the branches and draped over the ivy , folds of it damming the little stream . With an audible splash , the anemopter set down , the ramps lowered , and Bianca stepped off into cold ankle-deep water that made her glad of her knee-high boots . Fry followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing at Fry from the deck of the other anemopter . " Come here . Miss Nazario-I 'd like you to have a look at that balloon . " " Balloon ? " Valadez gestured impatiently downstream . Suddenly Bianca saw the white material for the shredded , deflated gasbag it was ; and saw , too , that there was a basket attached to it , lying on its side , partially submerged in the middle of the stream . Ismail was standing over it , waving . Bianca splashed over to the basket . It actually was a basket , two meters across and a meter and a half high , woven from strips of something like bamboo or rattan . The gasbag - this was obvious , once Bianca saw it up close-had been made from one of the ballonets of a zaiatn , a zaiatn younger and smaller even than the one Bianca had seen killed ; it had been tanned , but inexpertly , and by someone without access to the sort of industrial equipment the poachers used . Bianca wondered about the way the gasbag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew , were very strong . A hydrogen explosion ? " Make want fly got very bad , " Ismail commented , as Bianca came around to the open side of the basket . " They certainly did , " she said . In the basket there were only some wool blankets and some empty leather waterbags , probably used both for drinking water and for ballast . The lines used to control the vent flaps were all tangled together , and tangled , too , with the lines that secured the gasbag to the basket , but Bianca could guess how they had worked . No stove . It seemed to have been a pure hydrogen balloon ; and why not , she thought , with all the hydrogen anyone could want free from the nearest zaratn 's vent valves ? " Where did it come from ? " she asked . Ismal rippled his arms in a way that Bianca guessed was meant to be an imitation of a human shrug . One of his eyes glanced downstream . Bianca fingered the material of the basket : tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Encantada 's . She followed Ismal 's glance . The trees hid the western horizon , but she knew , if she could see beyond them , what would be there . Aloud , she said : " Finisterra . " She splashed back to the anemopters . Valadez 's hatch was open . " I 'm telling you , " Fry was saying , " I do n't know her ! " " Fuck off , Fry , " Valadez said as Bianca stepped into the cabin . " Look at her ID . " The her in question was a young woman with short black hair and sallow skin , wearing tan off-world cottons like Fry 's under a colorful homespun serape , and at first Bianca was not sure the woman was alive , because the man next to her on Valadez 's floor , also in homespun , was clearly dead , his eyes half-lidded , his olive skin gone muddy gray . The contents of their pockets were spread out on a low table . As Bianca was taking in the scene , Fry bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edith Dinh , ' " he read . He tossed the tag back and looked at Valadez . " So ? " " " Edith Dinh , Consilium Ethnological Service , ' " Valadez growled . " Issued Shawwal " 43 . You were here with the Ecological Service from Rajab " 42 to Muharram " 46 . Look again ! " Fry turned away . " All right ! " he said . " Maybe - maybe I met her once or twice . " " So , " said Valadez . " Now we 're getting somewhere . Who the hell is she ? And what 's she doing here ? " " She 's .... " Fry glanced at the woman and then quickly looked away . " I do n't know . I think she was a population biologist or something . There was a group working with the , you know , the natives - " " There are n't any natives on Sky , " said Valadez . He prodded the dead man with the toe of his boot . " You mean these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sustainable development " program going-farming , forestry . Teaching them how to live on Finisterra without killing it . " Valadez looked skeptical . " If the Consilium wanted to stop them from killing Finisterra , why did n't they just send in the wardens ? " " Interdepartmental politics . The zaratanes were EcoServ 's responsibility ; the n- - I mean , the inhabitants were EthServ 's . " Fry shrugged . " You know the wardens . They 'd have taken bribes from anyone who could afford it and shot the rest . " " Damn right I know the wardens . " Valadez scowled . " So instead EthServ sent in these do-gooders to teach them to make balloons ? " Fry shook his head . " I do n't know anything about that . " " Miss Nazario ? Tell me about that balloon . " " It 's a hydrogen balloon , I think . Probably filled from some zaratn 's external vents . " She shrugged . " It looks like the sort of thing I 'd expect someone living out here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valadez nodded . " But , " Bianca added , " I ca n't tell you why it crashed . " Valadez snorted . " I do n't need you to tell me that , " he said . " It crashed because we shot it down . " Pitching his voice for the anemopter 's communication system , he called out : " Ismal ! " Bianca tried to keep the shock from showing on her face , and after a moment she had regained her composure . You knew they were criminals when you took their money , she told herself . The firija 's eyes came around the edge of the doorway . " Yes ? " " Tell the tug crews to pack that thing up , " said Valadez . " Every piece , every scrap . Pack it up and drop it into clear air . " The alien 's walking machine clambered into the cabin . Its legs bent briefly , making a little bob like a curtsey . " Yes . " Ismal gestured at the bodies of the dead man and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valadez 's . " These two what do ? " he asked . " Them , too , " said Valadez . " Lash them into the basket . " The firija made another bob and started to bend down to pick them up . Bianca looked down at the two bodies , both of them , the dead man and the unconscious woman , looking small and thin and vulnerable . She glanced at Fry , whose eyes were fixed on the floor , his lips pressed together in a thin line . Then she looked over at Valadez , who was methodically sweeping the balloonists " effects into a pile , as if neither Bianca nor Fry was present . " No , " she said . Ismal stopped and straightened up . " What ? " said Valadez . " No , " Bianca repeated . " You want her bringing the wardens down on us ? " Valadez demanded . " That 's murder , Mr. Valadez , " Bianca said . " I wo n't be a party to it . " The poacher 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're already an accessory , " he said . " After the fact , " Bianca replied evenly . She kept her eyes on Valadez . The poacher looked at the ceiling . " Fuck your mother , " he muttered . He looked down at the two bodies , and at Ismal , and then over at Bianca . He sighed heavily . " All right , " he said to the firija . " Take the live one back to the camp . Secure a bungalow , one of the ones out by the edge " - he glanced at Bianca - " and lock her in it . Okay ? " " Okay , " said Ismal . " Dead one what do ? " Valadez looked at Bianca again . " The dead one , " he said , " goes in the basket . " Bianca looked at the dead man again , wondering what bravery or madness had brought him aboard that fragile balloon , and wondering what he would have thought if he had known that the voyage would end this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She supposed he must have known there was a chance of it . After a moment , she nodded , once . " Right , " said Valadez . " Now get back to work , damn it . " 6 . THE CITY OF THE DEAD The anemopter that brought Bianca and Fry over the ridge took them back . Fry was silent , hunched , his elbows on his knees , staring at nothing . What fear or guilt was going through his mind , Bianca could n't guess . After a little while she stopped watching him . She thought about the Finisterran balloon , so simple , so fragile , making her father 's wood-and-silk craft look as sophisticated as the Lupita Jerz . She took out her pocket system , sketched a simple globe and basket , then erased them . Make want fly very bad , Ismal the firija had said . Why ? Bianca undid the erasure , bringing her sketch back . She drew the spherical balloon out into a blunt torpedo , round at the nose , tapering to a point behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing them to be controlled from the basket . A propeller , powered by - she had to think for a little while - by an alcohol-fueled engine , carved from zaratn bones .... The anemopter was landing . Bianca sighed and again erased the design . The firija guard outside Edith Dinh 's bungalow did n't seem to speak Arabic or Spanish , or for that matter any human language at all . Bianca wondered if the choice was deliberate , the guard chosen by Valadez as a way of keeping a kind of solitary confinement . Or was the guard Valadez 's choice at all ? she wondered suddenly . Looking at the meter-long weapon cradled in the alien 's furred arms , she shivered . Then she squared her shoulders and approached the bungalow . Wordlessly , she waved the valise she was carrying , as if by it her reason for being there were made customary and obvious . The alien said something in its own fluting language - whether a reply to her , or a request for instructions from some unseen listener , Bianca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pass , apparently , or by being seen in Valadez 's company she had acquired some sort of reflected authority ; because the firija lifted its weapon and , as the bungalow 's outer door slid open , motioned for her to enter . The inner door was already open . " Hla ? " Bianca called out , tentatively . Immediately she felt like an idiot . But the answer came : " Aqui . " The interior layout of the bungalow was the same as Bianca 's . The voice came from the sitting room . Bianca found Dinh there , still wearing the clothes she 'd had on when they found her , sitting with her knees drawn up , staring out the east window into the sky . The east was dark with rain clouds , and far below , Bianca could see flashes of lightning . " Salaam aleikum , " said Bianca , taking refuge in the formality of the Arabic . " Aleikum as-salaam , " Dinh replied . She glanced briefly at Bianca and looked away ; then looked back again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent and the mechanical fluency of Fry 's language module , she said : " You 're not from Finisterra . " " No , " said Bianca , giving up on the Arabic . " I 'm from Rio Pcaro - from Earth . My name is Nazario , Bianca Nazario y Arenas . " " Edith Dinh . " Dinh stood up . There was an awkward moment , where Bianca was not sure whether to bow or curtsey or give Dinh her hand . She settled for proffering the valise . " I brought you some things , " she said . " Clothes , toiletries . " Dinh looked surprised . " Thanks , " she said , taking the valise and looking inside . " Are they feeding you ? I could bring you some food . " " The kitchen still works , " said Dinh . She held up a white packet . " And these ? " " Sanitary napkins , " said Bianca . " Sanitary ... ? " Color rose to Dinh 's face . " Oh . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packet back in the valise and closed it . Bianca looked away , feeling her own cheeks blush in turn . Damned extraados , she thought . " I 'd better - " be going , she started to say . " Please - " said Dinh . The older woman and the younger stood there for a moment , looking at each other . Bianca suddenly wondered what impulse had brought her here , whether curiosity or Christian charity or simply a moment of loneliness , weakness . Of course she 'd had to stop Valadez from killing the girl , but this was clearly a mistake . " Sit , " Dinh said . " Let me get you something . Tea . Coffee . " " I - All right . " Bianca sat , slowly , perching on the edge of one of the too-soft extraado couches . " Coffee , " she said . The coffee was very dark , sweeter than Bianca liked it , flavored with something like condensed milk . She was glad to have it , regardless , glad to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't look like a poacher , " Dinh said . " I 'm an aeronautical engineer , " Bianca said . " I 'm doing some work for them . " She looked down at her coffee , took a sip , and looked up . " What about you ? Fry said you 're a biologist of some kind . What were you doing in that balloon ? " She could n't tell whether the mention of Fry 's name had registered , but Dinh 's mouth went thin . She glanced out the west window . Bianca followed her glance and saw the guard , slumped in its walker , watching the two women with one eye each . She wondered again whether Valadez was really running things , and then whether the firija 's ignorance of human language was real or feigned - and whether , even if it was real , someone less ignorant might be watching and listening , unseen . Then she shook her head and looked back at Dinh , waiting . " Finisterra 's falling , " Dinh said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big ; it 's losing lift . It 's fallen more than fifty meters in the last year alone . " " That does n't make sense , " Bianca said . " The lift-to-weight ratio of an aerostat depends on the ratio of volume to surface area . A larger zaratn should be more efficient , not less . And even if it does lose lift , it should only fall until it reaches a new equilibrium . " " It 's not a machine , " Dinh said . " It 's a living creature . " Bianca shrugged . " Maybe it 's old age , then , " she said . " Everything has to die sometime . " " Not like this , " Dinh said . She set down her coffee and turned to face Bianca fully . " Look . We do n't know who built Sky , or how long ago , but it 's obviously artificial . A gas giant with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere ? That does n't happen . And the Earthlike biology - the zaratnes are DNA-based , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Phenomenological Service had its way , they 'd just quarantine the entire system , and damn Sky and everybody on it . " The archipelago ecology is as artificial as everything else . Whoever designed it must have been very good ; post-human , probably , maybe even post-singularity . It 's a robust equilibrium , full of feedback mechanisms , ways to correct itself . But we , us ordinary humans and human-equivalents , we 've " - she made a helpless gesture - " fucked it up . You know why Encantada 's stayed here so long ? Breeding , that 's why ... or maybe " pollination " would be a better way to put it .... " She looked over at Bianca . " The death of an old zaratn like Finisterra should be balanced by the birth of dozens , hundreds . But you , those bastards you work for , you 've killed them all . " Bianca let the implication of complicity slide . " All right , then , " she said . " Let 's hear your plan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " For Finisterra . How are you going to save it ? " Dinh stared at her for a moment , then shook her head . " I ca n't , " she said . She stood up and went to the east window . Beyond the sheet of rain that now poured down the window , the sky was deep mauve shading to indigo , relieved only by the lightning that sparked in the deep and played across the fins of the distant zaratanes of the archipelago 's outer reaches . Dinh put her palm flat against the diamond pane . " I ca n't save Finisterra , " she said quietly . " I just want to stop you hijos de puta from doing this again . " Now Bianca was stung . " Hija de puta , yourself , " she said . " You 're killing them , too . Killing them and making balloons out of them , how is that better ? " Dinh turned back . " One zaratn the size of the one they 're slaughtering out there right now would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " The only way to save the archipelago is to make the zaratanes more valuable alive than dead - and the only value a live zaratn has , on Sky , is as living space . " " You 're trying to get the Finisterrans to colonize the other zaratanes ? " Bianca asked . " But why should they ? What 's in it for them ? " " I told you , " Dinh said . " Finisterra 's dying . " She looked out the window , down into the depths of the storm , both hands pressed against the glass . " Do you know how falling into Sky kills you , Bianca ? First , there 's the pressure . On the slopes of Finisterra , where the people live , it 's a little more than a thousand millibars . Five kilometers down , under Finisterra 's keel , it 's double that . At two thousand millibars you can still breathe the air . At three thousand , nitrogen narcosis sets in - " rapture of the deep/ they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of oxygen alone is enough to make your lungs bleed . " She stepped away from the window and looked at Bianca . " But you 'll never live to suffer that , " she said . " Because of the heat . Every thousand meters the average temperature rises six or seven degrees . Here it 's about fifteen . Under Finisterra 's keel it 's closer to fifty . Twenty kilometers down , the air is hot enough to boil water . " Bianca met her gaze steadily . " I can think of worse ways to die , " she said . " There are seventeen thousand people on Finisterra , " said Dinh . " Men , women , children , old people . There 's a town - they call it the Lost City , la ciudad perdida . Some of the families on Finisterra can trace their roots back six generations . " She gave a little laugh , with no humor in it . " They should call it la ciudad muerta . They 're the walking dead , all seventeen thousand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will live to see it die . Already the crops are starting to fail . Already more old men and old women die every summer , as the summers get hotter and drier . The children of the children who are born today will have to move up into the hills as it gets too hot to grow crops on the lower slopes ; but the soil is n't as rich up there , so many of those crops will fail , too . And their children 's children ... wo n't live to be old enough to have children of their own . " " Surely someone will rescue them before then , " Bianca said . " Who ? " Dinh asked . " The Consilium ? Where would they put them ? The vacuum balloon stations and the elevator gondolas are already overcrowded . As far as the rest of Sky is concerned , the Finisterrans are " malcontents " and " criminal elements . " Who 's going to take them in ? " " Then Valadez is doing them a favor , " Bianca said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's not my operation , " Bianca said , trying to keep her voice level . " And I did n't ask his first name . " Dinh fell into the window seat . " Of course it would be , " she said . " Who else would they .... " She trailed off , looking out the west window , toward the killing ground . Then , suddenly , she turned back to Bianca . " What do you mean , doing them a favor ? " she said . " Finisterra , " Bianca said . " He 's poaching Finisterra . " Dinh stared at her . " My God , Bianca ! What about the people ? " " What about them ? " asked Bianca . " They 'd be better off somewhere else - you said that yourself . " " And what makes you think Valadez will evacuate them ? " " He 's a thief , not a mass murderer . " Dinh gave her a withering look . " He is a murderer , Bianca . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the alcalde of Ciudad Perdida . He killed his own stepfather , two uncles , and three brothers . They were going to execute him - throw him over the edge - but a warden airboat picked him up . He spent two years with them , then killed his sergeant and three other wardens , stole their ship and sold it for a ticket off-world . He 's probably the most wanted man on Sky . " She shook her head and , unexpectedly , gave Bianca a small smile . " You did n't know any of that when you took the job , did you ? " Her voice was full of pity . It showed on her face as well , and suddenly Bianca could n't stand to look at it . She got up and went to the east window . The rain was lighter now , the lightning less frequent . She thought back to her simulations , her plans for lifting Finisterra up into the waiting embrace of the skyhook : the gasbags swelling , the zaratn lifting , first slowly and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's atmosphere . But now her inner vision was not the ghost-shape of a projection but a living image-trees cracking in the cold , water freezing , blood boiling from the ground in a million , million tiny hemorrhages . She saw her mother 's house in Punta Aguila - her sister-in-law 's house , now : saw its windows rimed with frost , the trees in the courtyard gone brown and sere . She saw the Mercado de los Maculados beneath a blackening sky , the awnings whipped away by a thin wind , ice-cold , bone-dry . He killed that Finisterran balloonist , she thought . He was ready to kill Dinh . He 's capable of murder . Then she shook her head . Killing one person , or two , to cover up a crime , was murder , she thought . Killing seventeen thousand people by deliberate asphyxiation-men , women , and children - was n't murder , it was genocide . She took her cup of coffee from the table , took a sip and put it down again . " Thank you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can you just let him do this ? " Dinh demanded . " How can you help him do this ? " Bianca turned on her . Dinh was on her feet ; her fists were clenched , and she was shaking . Bianca stared her down , her face as cold and blank as she could make it . She waited until Dinh turned away , throwing herself into a chair , staring out the window . " I saved your life , " Bianca told her . " That was more than I needed to do . Even if I did believe that Valadez meant to kill every person on Finisterra , which I do n't , that would n't make it my problem . " Dinh turned farther away . " Listen to me , " Bianca said , " because I 'm only going to explain this once . " She waited until Dinh , involuntarily , turned back to face her . " This job is my one chance , " Bianca said . " This job is what I 'm here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Saving the world is a luxury for spoiled extraado children like you and Fry . It 's a luxury I do n't have . " She went to the door , and knocked on the window to signal the fizija guard . " I 'll get you out of here if I can , " she added , over her shoulder . " But that 's all I can do . I 'm sorry . " Dinh had n't moved . As the firija opened the door , Bianca heard Dinh stir . " Erasmus Fry ? " she asked . " The naturalist ? " " That 's right . " Bianca glanced back , and saw Dinh looking out the window again . " I 'd like to see him , " Dinh said . " I 'll let him know , " said Bianca . The guard closed the door behind her . 7 . THE FACE IN THE MIRROR Lightning still played along Encantada 's dorsal ridge , but here on the eastern edge the storm had passed . A clean , electric smell was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Bianca returned to her own bungalow through rain that had died to a drizzle . She called Fry . " What is it ? " he asked . " Miss Dinh , " Bianca said . " She wants to see you . " There was silence on the other end . Then : " You told her I was here ? " " Sorry , " Bianca said insincerely . " It just slipped out . " More silence . " You knew her better than you told Valadez , did n't you , " she said . She heard Fry sigh . " Yes . " " She seemed upset , " Bianca said . " You should go see her . " Fry sighed again , but said nothing . " I 've got work to do , " Bianca said . " I 'll talk to you later . " She ended the call . She was supposed to make a presentation tomorrow , to Valadez and some of the poachers " crew bosses , talking about what they would be doing to Finisterra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the visuals could be auto-generated from the design files . She opened the projection file and poked at it for a little while , but found it hard to concentrate . Suddenly to Bianca her clothes smelled of death , of Dinh 's dead companion and the slaughtered zaratn and the death she 'd spared Dinh from and the eventual deaths of all the marooned Finisterrans . She stripped them off and threw them in the recycler ; bathed , washed her hair , changed into a nightgown . They should call it la ciudad muerta . Even though no one who 's alive on Finisterra today will live to see it die . She turned off the light , Dinh 's words echoing in her head , and tried to sleep . But she could n't ; she could n't stop thinking . Thinking about what it felt like to be forced to live on , when all you had to look forward to was death . She knew that feeling very well . What Bianca had on Pablo 's wife Mlia , the instrument-maker 's daughter , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Mlia had on Bianca was a keen sense of territory and the experience of growing up in a house full of sisters . Bianca continued to live in the house after Mlia moved in , even though it was Mlia 's house now , and continued , without credit , to help her brother with the work that came in . But she retreated over the years , step by step , until the line was drawn at the door of the fourth-floor room that had been hers ever since she was a girl ; and she buried herself in her blueprints and her calculations , and tried to pretend she did n't know what was happening . And then there was the day she met her other sister-in-law . Her moro sister-in-law . In the Mercado de los Maculados , where the aliens and the extraados came to sell their trinkets and their medicines . A dispensation from the ayuntamiento had recently opened it to Christians . Zahra al-Halim , a successful architect , took Bianca to her home , where Bianca ate caramels and drank blackberry tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty years , and tried very hard to call him Wald and not Jess . Here was a world that could be hers , too , she sensed , if she wanted it . But like Jess/Wald , she would have to give up her old world to have it . Even if she remained a Christian she would never see the inside of a church again . And she would still never be accepted by the engineers " guild . She went back to the Nazario house that evening , ignoring the barbed questions from Mlia about how she had spent her day ; she went back to her room , with its blueprints and its models , and the furnishings she 'd had all her life . She tried for a little while to work , but was unable to muster the concentration she needed to interface with the system . Instead she found herself looking into the mirror . And looking into the mirror Bianca focused not on the fragile trapped shapes of the flying machines tacked to the wall behind her , spread out and pinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tired face , the stray wisps of dry , brittle hair , the lines that years of captivity had made across her forehead and around her eyes . And , meeting those eyes , it seemed to Bianca that she was looking not into the mirror but down through the years of her future , a long , straight , narrow corridor without doors or branches , and that the eyes she was meeting at the end of it were the eyes of Death , her own , su propria Muerte , personal , personified . Bianca got out of bed , turned on the lights . She picked up her pocket system . She wondered if she should call the wardens . Instead she unerased , yet again , the sketch she 'd made earlier of the simple alcohol-powered dirigible . She used the Nazario family automation to fill it out with diagrams and renderings , lists of materials , building instructions , maintenance and pre-flight checklists . It was n't much , but it was better than Dinh 's balloon . Now she needed a way for Dinh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking as she did so that there was some justice in it - she turned back to the system Valadez had given her . This was the sort of work the extraado automation was made for , no constraints other than those imposed by function , every trick of exotic technology available to be used . It was a matter of minutes for Bianca to sketch out her design ; an hour or so to refine it , to trim away the unnecessary pieces until what remained was small enough to fit in the valise she 'd left with Dinh . The only difficult part was getting the design automation to talk to the bungalow 's fabricator , which was meant for clothes and furniture and domestic utensils . Eventually she had to use her pocket system to go out on Sky 's local net - hoping as she did so that Valadez did n't have anyone monitoring her-and spend her own funds to contract the conversion out to a consulting service , somewhere out on one of the elevator gondolas . Eventually she got it done , though . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the bed . Tomorrow she could get the valise back and smuggle the package to Dinh , along with the dirigible designs . But first she had a presentation to make to Valadez . She wondered what motivated him . Nothing so simple as money - she was sure of that , even if she had trouble believing he was the monster Dinh had painted him to be . Was it revenge he was after ? Revenge on his family , revenge on his homeland ? That struck Bianca a little too close to home . She sighed and turned out the lights . 8 . THE PROFESSIONALS By morning the storm had passed and the sky was blue again , but the inside of Valadez 's bungalow was dark , to display the presenters " projections to better advantage . Chairs for Valadez and the human crew bosses were arranged in a rough semicircle ; with them were the aliens whose anatomy permitted them to sit down . Ismail and the other firija stood in the back , their curled arms and the spindly legs of their machines making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potted plants . Then the fronds stirred , suddenly menacing . Bianca shivered . Who was really in charge ? No time to worry about that now . She straightened up and took out her pocket system . " " In a moment , " she began , pitching her voice to carry to the back of the room , " Mr. Fry will be going over the zaratan 's metabolic processes and our plans to stimulate the internal production of hydrogen . What I 'm going to be talking about is the engineering work required to make that extra hydrogen do what we need it to do . " Bianca 's pocket system projected the shape of a hundred-kilometer zaratan , not Finisterra or any other particular individual but rather an archetype , a sort of Platonic ideal . Points of pink light brightened all across the projected zaratan 's back , each indicating the position of a sphincter that would have to be cut out and replaced with a mechanical valve . " Our primary concern during the preparation phase has to be these external vents . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast valves .... " As she went on , outlining the implants and grafts , surgeries and mutilations needed to turn a living zaratan into an animatronic corpse , a part of her was amazed at her own presumption , amazed at the strong , confident , professional tone she was taking . It was almost as if she were a real engineer . The presentation came to a close . Bianca drew in a deep breath , trying to maintain her veneer of professionalism . This part was n't in her outline . " And then , finally , there is the matter of evacuation , " she said . In the back of the room , Ismail stirred . " Evacuation ? " he asked - the first word anyone had uttered through the whole presentation . Bianca cleared her throat . Red stars appeared along the imaginary zaratn 's southeastern edge , approximating the locations of Ciudad Perdida and the smaller Finisterran villages . " Finisterra has a population of between fifteen and twenty thousand , most of them concentrated in these settlements here , " she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferez , it should take roughly - " " Not your problem , Miss Nazario . " Valadez waved a hand . " In any case , there wo n't be any evacuations . " Bianca looked at him , appalled ; and it must have shown on her face because Valadez laughed . " Do n't look at me like that , Miss Nazario . We 'll set up field domes over Ciudad Perdida and the central pueblos , to tide them over till we get them where they 're going . If they keep their heads they should be fine . " He laughed again . " Fucking hell , " he said , shaking his head . " What did you think this was about ? You did n't think we were going to kill twenty thousand people , did you ? " Bianca did n't answer . She shut the projection off and sat down , putting her pocket system away . Her heart was racing . " Right , " said Valadez . " Nice presentation , Miss Nazario . Mr. Fry ? " Fry stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me - " He patted his pockets . " I , ah , I think I must have left my system in my bungalow . " Valadez sighed . " We 'll wait , " he said . The dark room was silent . Bianca tried to take slow , deep breaths . Mother of God , she thought , thank you for not letting me do anything stupid . In the next moment she doubted herself . Dinh had been so sure . How could Bianca know whether Valadez was telling the truth ? There was no way to know , she decided . She 'd just have to wait and see . Fry came back in , breathless . " Ah , it was n't - " The voice that interrupted him was loud enough that at first it was hardly recognizable as a voice ; it was only a wall of sound , seeming to come from the air itself , bazaar-Arabic words echoing and reechoing endlessly across the camp . " THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENT , " it said . " ALL PERSONNEL IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARK WARDENS IN AN ORDERLY FASHION . ANY PERSONS CARRYING WEAPONS WILL BE PRESUMED TO BE RESISTING ARREST AND WILL BE DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY . ANY VEHICLE ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE THE ENCAMPMENT WILL BE DESTROYED . YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO COMPLY . " The announcement repeated itself : first in the fluting language of the firija , then in Miami Spanish , then as a series of projected alien glyphs , logograms and semagrams . Then the Arabic started again . " Fuck your mother , " said Valadez grimly . All around Bianca , poachers were gathering weapons . In the back of the room , the firija were having what looked like an argument , arms waving , voices raised in a hooting , atonal cacophony . " What do we do ? " Fry shouted , over the wardens " announcement . " Get out of here , " said Valadez . " Make fight ! " said Ismail , turning several eyes from the firija discussion . " Is n't that resisting arrest ? " asked Bianca . Valadez laughed harshly . " Not shooting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The wardens are n't the Phenomenological Service . They 're not civilized Caliphate cops . Killed while resisting arrest is what they 're all about . Believe me - I used to be one . " Taking a surprisingly small gun from inside his jacket , he kicked open the door and was gone . Around the Lupita Jerez was a milling knot of people , human and otherwise , some hurrying to finish the loading , others simply fighting to get aboard . Something large and dark - and fast - passed over the camp , and there was a white flash from the cargo-lifter , and screams . In the wake of the dark thing came a sudden sensation of heaviness , as if the flank of Encantada were the deck of a ship riding a rogue wave , leaping up beneath Bianca 's feet . Her knees buckled and she was thrown to the ground , pressed into the grass by twice , three times her normal weight . The feeling passed as quickly as the wardens " dark vehicle . Ismail , whose walker had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that ? " Bianca demanded , bruises making her wince as she tried to brush the dirt and grass from her skirts . " Antigravity ship , " Ismail said . " Same principle like starship wave propagation drive . " " Antigravity ? " Bianca stared after the ship , but it was already gone , over Encantada 's dorsal ridge . " If you conos have antigravity , then why in God 's name have we been sitting here playing with catapults and balloons ? " " Make very expensive , " said Ismail . " Minus two suns exotic mass , same like starship . " The firija waved two of its free eyes . " Why do ? Plenty got cheap way to fly . " Bianca realized that despite the remarks Valadez had made on the poverty of Sky , she had been thinking of all extraados and aliens - with their ships and machines , their familiar way with sciences that in Rio Picaro were barely more than a whisper of forbidden things hidden behind the walls of the rich moms " palaces - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling like a fool for not having understood sooner , she realized that between the power of the Consilium and people like Valadez there was a gap as wide as , if not wider than , the gap between those rich moros and the most petty AIi Baba in the back streets of Punta Aguila . She glanced toward the airfield . Aerial tugs were lifting off ; anemopters were blurring into motion . But as she watched , one of the tugs opened up into a ball of green fire . An anemopter made it as far as the killing ground before being hit by something that made its static fields crawl briefly with purple lightnings and then collapse , as the craft 's material body crashed down in an explosion of earth . And all the while the wardens " recorded voice was everywhere and nowhere , repeating its list of instructions and demands . " Not any more , we do n't , " Bianca said to Ismail . " We 'd better run . " The firija raised its gun . " First got kill prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving , the mechanical legs of the walker sure-footed on the broken ground , taking long , swift strides , no longer comical but frighteningly full of purpose . Bianca struggled after the fiiija but quickly fell behind . The surface of the killing ground was rutted and scarred , torn by the earth-moving equipment used to push the offal of the gutted zaiatanes over the edge . Bianca supposed grasses had covered it once , but now there was just mud and old blood . Only the certainty that going back would be as bad as going forward kept Bianca moving , slipping and stumbling in reeking muck that was sometimes ankle-deep . By the time she got to Dinh 's bungalow , Ismail was already gone . The door was ajar . Maybe the wardens rescued her , Bianca thought ; but she could n't make herself believe it . She went inside , moving slowly . " Edith ? " No answer ; not that Bianca had really expected any . She found her in the kitchen , face down , feet toward the door as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From three meters away Bianca could see the neat , black , fist-sized hole in the small of Dinh 's back . She felt no need to get closer . Fry 's pocket system was on the floor in the living room , as Bianca had known it would be . " You should have waited , " Bianca said to the empty room . " You should have trusted me . " She found her valise in Dinh 's bedroom and emptied the contents onto the bed . Dinh did not seem to have touched any of them . Bianca 's eyes stung with tears . She glanced again at Fry 's system . He 'd left it on purpose , Bianca realized ; she 'd underestimated him . Perhaps he had been a better person than she herself , all along . She looked one more time at the body lying on the kitchen floor . " No , you should n't , " she said then . " You should n't have trusted me at all . " Then she went back to her own bungalow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FINISTERRA A hundred meters , two hundred , five hundred - Bianca falls , the wind whipping at her clothes , and the hanging vegetation that covers Encantada 's flanks is a green-brown blur , going gray as it thins , as the zaratan 's body curves away from her . She blinks away the tears brought on by the rushing wind and tries to focus on the monitor panel of the harness . She took it from an off-the-shelf emergency parachute design ; surely , she thinks , it must be set to open automatically at some point ? But the wind speed indicator is the only one that makes sense ; the others altitude , attitude , rate of descent - are cycling through nonsense in three languages , baffled by the instruments " inability to find solid ground anywhere below . Then Bianca falls out of Encantada 's shadow into the sun , and before she can consciously form the thought her hand has grasped the emergency handle of the harness and pulled , convulsively ; and the glassy fabric of the paraballoon is billowing out above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugging at her , gently but firmly , smart threads reeling themselves quickly out and then slowly in again on their tiny spinnerets . After a moment , she catches her breath . She is no longer falling , but flying . She wipes the tears from her eyes . To the west , the slopes of Finisterra are bright and impossibly detailed in the low-angle sunlight , a million trees casting a million tiny shadows through the morning 's rapidly dissipating mist . She looks up , out through the nearly invisible curve of the paraballoon , and sees that Encantada is burning . She watches it for a long time . The air grows warmer , and more damp , too . With a start , Bianca realizes she is falling below Finisterra 's edge . When she designed the paraballoon , Bianca intended for Dinh to fall as far as she safely could , dropping deep into Sky 's atmosphere before firing up the reverse Maxwell pumps , to heat the air in the balloon and lift her back to Finisterra ; but it does not look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the poachers or the wardens . Bianca starts the pumps and the paraballoon slows , then begins to ascend . As the prevailing wind carries her inland , over a riot of tropical green , and in the distance Bianca sees the smoke rising from the chimneys of Ciudad Perdida , Bianca glances up again at the burning shape of Encantada . She wonders whether she 'll ever know if Valadez was telling the truth . Abruptly the jungle below her opens up , and Bianca is flying over cultivated fields , and people are looking up at her in wonder . Without thinking , she has cut the power to the pumps and opened the parachute valve at the top of the balloon . She lands hard , hobbled by the scarf still tied around her ankles , and rolls , the paraballoon harness freeing itself automatically in obedience to its original programming . She pulls the scarf loose and stands up , shaking out her torn , stained skirt . Children are already running toward her across the field . Savages , Fry said . Refugees . Bianca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tries to gather her scraps of Arabic , but is suddenly unable to remember anything beyond Salaam alaikum . The children - six , eight , ten of them - falter as they approach , stopping five or ten meters away . Salaam alaikum , Bianca rehearses silently . Alaikum as-salaam . She takes a deep breath . The boldest of the children , a stick-legged boy of eight or ten , takes a few steps closer . He has curly black hair and sun-browned skin , and the brightly colored shirt and shorts he is wearing were probably made by an autofactory on one of the elevator gondolas or vacuum balloon stations , six or seven owners ago . He looks like her brother Pablo , in the old days , before Jess left . Trying not to look too threatening , Bianca meets his dark eyes . " Hla , " she says . " Hla , " the boy answers . " Cmo te llamas ? Es este su global " Bianca straightens her back . " Yes , it 's my balloon , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If the balloon 's yours , " the boy asks , undaunted , " will you let me fly ink ? " Bianca looks out into the eastern sky , dotted with distant zaiatanes . There is a vision in her mind , a vision that she thinks maybe Edith Dinh saw : the skies of Sky more crowded than the skies over Rio Pcaro , Septentrionalis Archipelago alive with the bright shapes of dirigibles and gliders , those nameless zaiatanes out there no longer uncharted shoals but comforting and familiar landmarks . She turns to look at the rapidly collapsing paraballoon , and wonders how much work it would take to inflate it again . She takes out her pocket system and checks it : the design for the hand-built dirigible is still there , and the family automation too . This is n't what she wanted , when she set out from home ; but she is still a Nazario , and still an engineer . She puts the system away and turns back to the boy . " I have a better idea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your very own ? " The boy breaks into a smile .
