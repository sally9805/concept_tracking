One How would you kill him ? I do n't know . Think about it . He hurt you . He made you touch him . He humiliated you . You must want him to pay . Yeah , but . . . You would never really kill him . I know that . But you need to get over your anger , release the rage . The only way to be free of him is to picture him without any power over you . Visualize the one person you hate the most in the world dead . Can you ? Yes . What does he look like ? He 's sitting at his desk . And you walk in . . . what does he say to you ? " Come here . Kneel . Now . " What do you do ? I go . I have no choice . They 'll send me away . . . I 've lived on the streets . I 've been to juvie . It 's worse than sucking his dick . Picture yourself walking toward the desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time , you 're going to pay him back for touching you . For making you touch him . How ? I want him to know exactly what it feels like . And ? I want to cut his dick off and shove it down his throat . Let him suck on it . Good . Very good . Picture him choking on his penis whenever you get angry or upset . That 's the first step to getting rid of the rage , the anger . To heal and become normal . I 'll never be normal . Emily Chandler Montgomery would never be normal . She sat in her idling Volkswagen Bug and stared at thelooming house in front of her . She did n't even want to pull into the garage , as if it would swallow her and she 'd never escape . She hated coming home . Home . What a joke . She had no home . It had disappeared when her father died . All she had was a house of many rooms , none of which welcomed her , except for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She 'd run away , and that had n't worked . Living on the streets was impossible , especially for a pampered , spoiled rich kid like her . At least that 's what her shrink had told her . And in many ways -- most ways -- it was true . She did n't want to live on the street and sell her body . Because out there these were her choices : whore or gutter rat . Emily liked her bedroom , her spa , the Olympic-size swimming pool where she could swim laps until her arms ached and her lungs gasped for air . The clothes , the food , the roof . If only Victor was gone , she could live in the castle without fear . Why had her mother married Judge Victor Montgomery ? He was a creep back when they were dating , and he was worse now . A fake . A hypocrite . I hate you I hate you I hate you ! She pounded her fists on the steering wheel until her hands ached . The rage circulating in her blood made her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , but the words of her shrink battled against the anger . Take a deep breath . Again . Let it out slowly . Focus on your calm place . Picture a blank canvas . Now paint your oasis , the place you feel safe . Paint that in the canvas of your mind . Put yourself there , in the picture . Emily released the car 's clutch and slowly drove into the garage . She pretended she floated in the middle of the sea , nothing around her . The ocean was calm , peaceful , the water a brilliant blue , the sky orange , red , violet in the setting sun . Her oasis . As Emily parked her car next to Victor 's Jaguar , her safe place disappeared . She held her keys in her hand and considered running them along the side of his precious sports car . But they 'd know she did it and find a way to punish her . Make her spend another weekend in juvie . She could hear her mother 's cold , disapproving tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antics have embarrassed the family yet again . " When you get angry , you let your enemies have control . Take a deep breath . Picture those who torment you getting what 's coming to them . Justice for you and everyone like you . Write about it . Talk about it . Get it out of your system . When you keep your feelings inside , anger wins . Your enemy wins . Do n't let him win . Emily took a deep breath , then another . Through the windows on the far side of the garage , the quality of light seemed to have changed . How long had she been sitting in her car ? She looked at the time on the dashboard . Five-thirty ? A full hour ? That could n't be right . She picked up her cell phone to check the time . Five-thirty . This was n't the first time she 'd worked on controlling the rage only to discover that she 'd blanked out on the passage of time . She grabbed her backpack and reluctantly left the safe haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother would be home late . Wednesday , Wednesday . . . right , planning for her annual charity auction . This year it was puppies and kitties . Last year it was children . Every year a new cause , a cause that came first . A cause more important than her daughter . The one year Emily thought her mother had actually cared was the year she raised money for runaway children . Spent time with her , but it was all for show . She had been the poster child . The tears and forgiveness were all an act . It was for the cameras and society page , and to help Judge Victor Montgomery win reelection . Crystal Montgomery did n't care about her daughter , and Emily had almost given up caring about that sad fact . But she could n't . She sometimes wondered if she 'd ever really had a mom . Maybe the memories of them walking on the beach , playing with Barbies , making cookies was all a dream . Those good times seemed so far in the past that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the details to get herself through the nights when her mother was n't home . To get through the days when Victor was . Thirteen months and she would legally be able to walk out the door and live on her own . Her trust fund would be hers . She would no longer be dependent on her mother and Victor . Thirteen months . She prayed she survived that long . It was n't that she was worried about Victor killing her . She feared her own hand . She closed the large , overhead garage door with the remote and walked to the side door that led to a covered walk . Their house was huge , far bigger than the three of them needed , but Crystal and Victor entertained , and that meant they needed a big house with huge rooms to fill with people as phony as they . It struck her as sad that when her dad had been alive the house had n't seemed as big and scary , even though she 'd been smaller . And there 'd only been the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything was a game . They raced Matchbox cars down the long marble halls , played hide-and-seek in the maze of rooms , slid down the banister of the great center staircase . The fun died with her dad . Emily entered the house through the secondary entrance , the one Victor ordered the hired help to use . None of the outside doors used a key . That would be common . Emily typed in the security code on the keypad next to the door and the lock sprung . The atmo- sphere was cool , in both temperature and aesthetics . Her mother had the downstairs professionally redecorated every two years . Last year , she wanted the feeling of the ocean , everything in blues and greens . The sound system piped in canned ocean waves whenever her mother was home . No music , no mother . She waited for the intercom 's grating buzz , every cell in her body on alert . Victor was home , his Jaguar was in the garage . Of course he was home , it was Wednesday . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and Emily had to be home . Every day by six p.m. by order of the court . Damn curfew . Damn the police . Damn the whole fucking system . And damn her for being so stupid . Vandalizing the courthouse . What had she been thinking ? Of course , she had n't been . Just like when she 'd run away . All emotions , no plan . Emily could n't see anything beyond her anger . And she was paying for it now . Maybe she deserved it . The intercom did n't beep , her stepdad did n't summon her to his office . She slipped off her sandals to tread soundlessly across the marble floors . Slowly , she walked down the long , wide hall to the center foyer , waiting for the telltale click of the intercom and Judge Montgomery 's deep and disgusting voice . Emily , please come to my office . Nothing . Silence . Maybe he was on the phone . Maybe he had n't been watching the security system and was unaware she 'd come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . She started up the grand staircase , her heart racing . As Emily ascended , she began to run . Free . She was free . She 'd lock herself in her room , because he did n't dare come after her in there . It was always his office , his desk . His domain . She closed and locked the door behind her , grinning . She leaped onto her bed and jumped up and down like a little kid . Then she went into her bathroom and started the water in her bathtub . Hot , with bubbles . She was n't supposed to drink . In addition to being underage , it was a term of her plea bargain last year since she 'd been intoxicated when she 'd vandalized the courthouse . But she had a flask of dark rum hidden in her dresser , which she refilled periodically from Victor 's bar . She had to have something to wash the foul taste of him out of her mouth and mind . Now she drank in celebration . Locked in her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his desk chair , dead , his bloody body horribly mutilated .
