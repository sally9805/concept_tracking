She lifts the lid off the pot . Steam pours out , smelling unpleasant . Her son enters the kitchen . She claps the lid back down and looks at him . He 's got something under his arm . He looks at her too , and immediately they assume a kind of mental en guard . She foists her invisible foil . He twirls his pistols , whistles for his horse . This is a lawless kitchen . He is n't home yet , the father . But it would n't matter if he were . At his desk overlooking the lake of the corporate park , the father snoozes with the family 's prison cell keys hanging from his waistband . <p> If her son would not look at her like that , she swears she would love him better . The boy has everything - his own room , a truckload of electronics , a mother who delayed her own education to be there for him after school - and yet he looks at her with dark-circled Gulag eyes , as if at night his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just because he has to accompany her tonight - to a poetry reading . Her family history is full of suffering , and sometimes , when she thinks about it , her own life offends her . Her grandfather , for example , gave his life in Korea , orphaning four young children . She 's got a sister with lupus and a cousin with breast cancer , and sometimes the whole anonymous world itself comes pouring through the mail slot with its crimes and its moaning . But her son just stands there , skepticism incarnate , protecting his Game Boy under his arm . Surprisingly , he 's already got his jacket on . This , after two hours of whining and bargaining . What 's he up to ? She steps back from the stove . <p> He does not want whatever it is she 's cooking , whatever the heck is in that pot . He might be a child of American suburbs but he still has instincts and he knows danger by smell .

But if he 's forced to go with her tonight , like a baby , he 's not leaving without Final Fantasy V. He considers a smile , or some other pleasantry , just to get her to stop eyeing the Game Boy . If he says something quick , he decides , she will forget her misgiving . Or - he thinks - maybe he should offer to eat what she 's cooked for dinner after all , the gunk in the pot . He 's already got his jacket on , which he considers a big fat white flag . But if , in addition to this , he were to volunteer to eat the gunk in the pot . Triumphant , he sees himself sitting astride a pyramid of gold bricks at the US Mint , with his Game Boy . <p> But while he is lost in this age-old male trap of congratulating oneself in advance of victory , his mother completely changes the game . She yanks the strings of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns away , saying nothing . She overlooks the Game Boy for now , but he knows he has not secured any lasting amnesty . She has already plated two dishes with the steaming brown dookie , and she has moved to the nook where they sit , the two of them , every night , like chess partners , the ghost of the weekend hanging there , the sort-of fun they had together - Mother , Father , Son . <p> After she sits down , she gets up again , fetches the manila folder from the butcher 's block , and lays it next to her plate . She brushes her hair back over her shoulders . <p> " So I do n't forget to bring it , " she says aloud . <p> She looks down at her plate as if praying , but she is not praying . In fact , she is thinking that although she has no desire to kill herself , she misses the time when she had wanted to . She misses the time when she had threatened to - twenty years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanted her to get married so young , her parents . They had no problem with him per se . Thusly it lasted rather a short period of time - the screaming , the enforced separation , the blizzard of goosefeathers from the pummeled pillow - before the marriage went forward . Now they all adore him , her husband . And he adores her , and them , very much . Life has turned out to be sweet - it 's not that . It 's just . She lifts the fork , getting no further . She has no appetite . She is gaggingly nervous . She would give her right arm for someone to ask her how she is . Just , How you doing , Maura ? The possibility of her son asking her this is so remote it almost makes her laugh out loud . She talks herself back from such expectations . But she has , all of a sudden , become undisciplined . Her mind just-lurches . <p> Perhaps she has revealed too much of herself to the class . It 's a poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dissect them together . A little late to the game , back to school after forty , most of her fellow students in the class are far younger than she . Only one other lady is her age . This other lady - a lady with short red hair and pockmarked skin - is quite smart , but is so incapacitated by an unrelenting sense of doing and saying the wrong thing in class that , out on breaks together , the two of them never get beyond this , they never become friends . They should be friends , but they embarrass each other somehow . They merely wait for some scathing thing to be said about them both . That 's how she ended up getting close with the teacher . That 's why Maura ended up talking to the teacher instead , after class , about what she has realized , suddenly , thoroughly : She wants a divorce . She wants a divorce . She has - perhaps - for years . <p> The knowledge of this was so total that it became difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some insight about it . And so she lingered , after class , smoothing her hair . The teacher listened . The teacher was wise and moderate , but suddenly only total access was enough . She wanted to talk all the time . She would walk the teacher out to the parking lot , bantering ( they too , were exactly the same age ) . Only later , in a fix , did she also confide to one of the smarter students , the girl who writes odes to food , so that by the end of the course , she was talking about it all the time - not sentimentally , not melodramatically , just talking , to anyone who would listen , until she realized that she was becoming inured to the word " divorce " and to the idea of divorcing a man to whom she had been married for twenty years , a man who , by her own admission , she loves . <p> By now , she knows she 's not a great poet . The better she gets , the worse she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet in the class by far . No one holds a candle to her . It so happens that this lady has recently had a divorce of her own . The two of them discussed it passionately after the first class , and then not at all . It stopped being interesting to talk to someone so wracked with insecurity . That the divorcee was wracked with insecurity was starting to make things uncomfortable for others . Because the students were starting to see the space of radiant shame from which great poets write . They saw there was a difference between themselves and her . They did n't have enough shame or radiance . Maybe , Maura would say to herself , you just signed up for the class because you wanted to make some friends . Maybe you wanted to see what other people thought of you . Or what you yourself thought of you . And maybe those were all decent reasons . But then , at the end of the semester , the class meets at a bookstore caf and each student has to read one poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . At that point , it would only seem like cowardice not to show . <p> But she did write one decent poem . And that 's what 's in the manila folder . <p> Ah yes , the boy thinks , looking down at his plate - baked beans . His mother has cut up hot dogs and put them in the beans , so that if he tried to pick out the hot dogs , he would have to eat some beans collaterally . With a shudder , he remembers , several years back , the War of the Vitamin . Vitamins crushed secretly into his applesauce , stuck in a dinner roll . Liquid zinc in his juice . It was such a hard time for the two of them , he almost forgives her . If he could have swallowed them normally , he would have . But unfortunately , he can no longer persuade her that sometimes he 's not lying . He is definitely old enough to stay home alone tonight . Why wo n't she let him ? Besides , sometimes he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer bends to reason - his or anyone 's , including her own . She does n't seem to have the patience anymore . She has lumped everyone together - what does it matter who said what ? She sure looks pretty though , he thinks . Her lipstick has sparkles in it . He is looking at her , pushing at a rubbery log when , out of nowhere , she sets down her fork and napkin . <p> She looks up . <p> " Screw this , " she says . " I ca n't eat it either . " <p> They 're in the car now . He furtively turns on the Game Boy . He knows enough not to play it . He 's just more comfortable looking at one bright unchanging thing . The smear of the neighborhood goes by - the lights , his friends ' houses . He 's taken his traditional Most Wanted position in the passenger seat , butt scooted half off the cushion , head peaking just over the window , his parka shrugged up around his ears . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school day by a load-bearing hand . The one good thing about going with his mother tonight is that it counts as Reading homework . <p> A huge eighteen-wheeler comes up next to them at the stoplight . For some reason , he looks over at his mother . She is staring up at the rig . He suddenly wants her to say something . To speak . He clears his throat . The truck pulls out ahead of them as the light changes , HAZMATS written large on the side . <p> " Liquid nitrogen freezes metal , " says his mother softly . <p> They drive along for a moment . <p> The boy nods . Unable to think of anything else , he notes , " I remember that from Terminator 2 . " <p> She can not stop talking about it . It 's just , once the idea took hold , she somehow did n't want to let it drop . She was starting to think that staying married implied a lack of commitment - the commitment to getting divorced . And being around those young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem urgent : Was it right for either of she or her husband , two vital people , to own the other any longer ? To expect the other to go on unchangingly through life 's syncopation - those metrical , true rhymes of the rest of your life ? ( Sunday , donut hole / Special K , casserole . ) She was almost thinking of it as a favor to him . He was good , true , excitable - much like herself . She loved him ; it would be a favor . For her heart was pinging all over the place , without reason . It was like back then , with the goosefeathers and screaming - she felt passionate like that . But at forty years old , what do they let you do with a pillow except sleep on it ? Even her feelings for the teacher have been heaped upon the jury . Her nervous feelings , her glancing toward doorways , her lingering after class . <p> The teacher is a woman . Before now , before this time , her excitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sisterly fondness , not any sort of Sapphic quest . Women love other women . She has always had close , supportive friendships . But now her feelings for the teacher serve to demonstrate that her marriage is so unsatisfying that it has flipped her . She suspects that she only wants to impress the teacher . But she does n't want to be sure about it . The teacher has a broad nose and long , coarse hair . She looks like a black woman trapped in a white woman 's skin . She has a tired , amused manner , and you feel you could write down anything and give it to her and she would not judge you . Not that the teacher is without judgment . In fact , she is given to sudden fits of ranting - passionate , wacky speeches about her dislikes . For example , they all know that she hates euphemisms and intellectual laziness and all inventions that " invite us to plan for disaster . " The teacher has a living mind . And that is what Maura wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem in the folder . It is on her lap now . She and her son arc early to the reading . They sit side by side on folding chairs in the somehow disgusting sconce light of the franchise bookstore caf . Who knew that she would ever write a villanelle , at her age . She was surprised to be attracted to the order of it . Aba . aba .. nineteen echoey lines . The poems she had written in her journal before this class were in free verse or were rhyming . She has since come to see that the poems she wrote in her journal were without form and therefore were n't really " poetry . " " Poetry is born out of a tension between passion and the formal line , " the teacher has often said , her black/white face flushed with enthusiasm . " If we are to write poetry without even the most private structure or design , why write in lines ? Why break the lines at all ? " <p> But poetry is feeling ! someone invariably protests . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces of your feelings once they 've been thrown against the world . <p> The door to the bookstore caf opens . Maura 's heart skips a beat . She stands to see if it 's the teacher . But it 's only the ode girl . They wave at each other over the remaindered book tables . The girl comes over and says hello to her but not to her son . In fact , as the rest of the class gathers , nobody really pays any attention to her son because he does not look up from his Game Boy . Glancing down at him , she has a flash of urgent feeling : She must tell him something . But what ? <p> Bartz is from the secluded town of Lix . He 's an orphan , and has few friends . In Final Fantasy V , his true mission starts when he is mysteriously drawn to a meteoric crash site near the Castle Tycoon . There - not to give it all away - he meets Lena , and the true quest begins . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " jobs " as possible ( there are 26 ) . You ca n't " win " ( even he knows this ) . But you can survive for longer and longer periods of time , which is winning . And even though you know you ca n't " win " ( survive forever ) , you can get close , and so you keep trying , and - with the help of the mages ( black , red , and white ) , you elude Exdcath , and live on , and then die , and live again . <p> Life , too , observes the boy , pushing at the keypad of his small device , life too appears to be made of nearlies and start-overs . Is n't this the long series of drills he 's supposed to be at ? Or is there some mistake , he wonders remotely , and actually each day is progress but he just ca n't see it ? Like the word " enough : " he just ca n't ever spell it right no matter what context it 's in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busted up by being mad or by love . Love . Staring at her and wanting to pull the corners of her mouth . <p> Enuf ! <p> What he likes about her : <p> She 's his mother . <p> She 's pretty . <p> She swears a lot . <p> She does n't pretend to understand things she does n't understand . <p> But she stalks the hilltops of their weekends . The father 's face tilted upward , stupider looking than he is . Men never ask for directions , his mother often says , and that - it seems to the boy - is the truth . They all " want " to be together , but after a whole week of waiting for his presence , maybe they 've peaked . His friends all love his dad . They do n't like his mother much . But it does n't matter . He does . He loves her . And he sympathizes with her not understanding her , and he collects her little barbs in a bucket and takes them outside to be ignored , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting into his ear at some friend across the room . Tell you guys what , he says to them in his mind , his dad and his mom , You 're allowed to own one pair of casual pants and You 're allowed to shout into my ear and I 'm allowed to play my Game Boy until my face falls off . And you tell me - he thinks , smashing the buttons , busted up almost by tears - you tell me when we 're done . Not done for the night , but done . Do n't think I do n't remember ! I 'm the Black Mage ! And you-you were the White Mage , and you , the Red . <p> The teacher is half an hour late . Nobody knows what to do . The teacher is never late . What 's happened ? The students wonder aloud . It 's so unlike her . An emergency ? A death ? A lesson in self-reliance ? Whatever it is , they agree , if she 's not here by now , it means she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst themselves to start the reading . A couple of old people and one large man with a tattoo - audience members they never expected - have seated themselves down among the folding chairs and are waiting expectantly . After a little more time passes , the ode writer shrugs , gets up , and grabs the microphone on the podium . She makes a joke about how the people in the audience must be fulfilling a community service court order . <p> The ode writer reads her poem . It 's very funny , a good opener . Immediately everyone is relaxed . Even the Game Boy boy has glanced up . Looking over at him , his mother puts her arm around the back of his chair . She sees how his lips curl up a little , pretending to be too cool to laugh . In a flash , she loves him completely . She remembers his wet pure face gazing up from the bath - fourteen months old , rubbery-shouldered - giddy just from looking at her . She remembers musing aloud , I wish there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( And she remembers her husband , calling from another room , There is . It 's called your heart . ) In a flash she also remembers what she has to tell her son : He 's in the poem . She worked on it so hard that she forgot he was in it . You could call it autobiographical . The poem is called " At the End of My Love . " It is a villanelle . She would like to explain the form of a villanelle to him , so he can get more out of it . She licks her lips , leans over . <p> " My poem is a villanelle , " she whispers . " The first and third lines repeat the whole way through . You should listen to it . You can hear the pattern . " She licks her lips . " The pattern is repeated emotion , emotion that is moving and not moving . " <p> She is looking down at him . The boy has not stopped thumbing the keypad on his Game Boy . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sticky keys clicking . Up at the podium , another student is reading a long rambling list poem about different kinds of cars . The student , still wearing his ice hockey jacket , reads clearly and methodically . Every time the door opens , a handful of them look up hopefully for the teacher . Staring at the doorway , Maura notices again what she has been reluctant to admit : the divorcee is also missing . She thinks , But she will come . She must come . <p> When the teacher had announced the public reading to the class weeks ago , everyone groaned , but the red-headed divorcee had a particularly violent reaction . Out on break , she bent over , moaning softly . They stood , the two of them , trying to be friends , in the dark archway of the building . In sympathy , she put her hand on the divorcee 's back and patted it . She explained that she was nervous about the reading too . She told the divorcee about her own anxiety dream in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lack of talent . The divorcee stood upright and wiped the tears of pain from her eyes . Really ? she said , smiling a little . <p> And yet , in the end , this embarrassing admission had not helped , because the divorcee had not come . How could you be that good , Maura thinks , and not come ? How could you be that good and just let everyone think you were only what you appeared to be - a housewife , a woman who 'd tossed away her best years ? The boy in the ice hockey jacket smiles and goes back to his chair . And then , sitting there small and normal in her sweater , she realizes that she never actually took the divorcee seriously , that she never once imagined that her pain was not an exaggeration . Now she wonders , Is that what it feels like ? Is the loss that keen ? <p> Meanwhile , beside her , her son is electronically outdone . He swears softly . <p> She removes her arm from the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with it . She wants to rise up out of the audience . Holding her manila folder , she scoots her way through the people in folding chairs . <p> " I guess I 'll go next , " she says aloud . <p> " ' Atta way to swing the bat , " calls the ode writer . <p> She approaches the podium . Everyone is looking at her . Gazing out at the low-ceilinged room and the crowd , she experiences a brief dizziness . She puts her hand out for something familiar before regaining her balance against the podium . She swallows and taps the microphone . <p> " I guess I 'll go next , " she says again , into the mike . She pushes back her hair . " My poem is a villanelle . For those of you who did n't take the class , that means the first and third lines repeat through six stanzas , and then they form the last two . no - yes , " she laughs , " the last two lines of the poem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " OK , " she says , laughing . " My poem is called ' At the End of My Love . ' But first I 'd like to say that I never would have written it if not for this class . This class - " and here the microphone squeaks , as she has leaned in too closely , " has really put me in touch with new feelings about my life , new realizations , and I know that it has for a lot of you . It 's made me take a good hard look at my life . Where I need to , you know , come alive . Watching you all do that , I wanted to do that . So . " <p> She is n't sure why she has said all this . She planned to say it in front of the teacher , as a gift for the teacher . But saying it anyway she understands that it was never for the teacher , but for the class . She glances at her son - not to see if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure he is n't misbehaving . Then she takes one last glance at the door . <p> " Here goes , " she says . <p> And she reads : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Reading , aware of the collective listening , gradually , she feels without ego . Either that or she is all ego , she is everything , and the cafe and the tables and the clerks moving quiet as fish in the background are all part of her . She speaks in a loud , clear voice : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The next stanza , in this engorged moment , fills her with fresh disappointment . She looks up through her bangs and searches out the boy , but finding only the top of his bent head , she offers the stanza instead to the old people in the back row : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> She pauses , closes her mouth , and feels , briefly but overwhelmingly , sad . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> And now , facing the last stanza , she just wishes it could go on a little longer . It was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem . abab . This was the stanza in which , writing it , she 'd first given voice to the yearning . Something distant calling her away , calling her elsewhere , she was sure of it . Something distant that she can not really justify , and maybe it does not make sense to anyone else , but . A cool breeze washes over her , but she is too absorbed now to look towards the door . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> She only has to read the final lines , in which the speaker decides , declares , turns away from the union , alone . Once we two fit like a glove . But today , husband , I am at the end of my love . She becomes aware of a new presence in the room . Even the boy looks up from his gadget . As she pauses to give effect to the ellipsis , the boy looks over his shoulder . When he turns back to her , he wears an expression of such unadulterated entreaty that she does not recognize him as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mouth pinched . What does he want ? She lifts her gaze up , up , she flies with it over the fear-exaggerated crowd , to the back row , and there , standing in his beige suit , thumbs hooked in his back pockets , is her husband . Twenty years I have loved you since . He looks flattered to see her gawking at him , clearly having lost her place . He smiles , waves , nods her on . Go ' head . Go ' head , you can do it . The many pairs of eyes blink back at her sympathetically , becoming more interested in her pause than they were in her words . She finds her place with a damp finger and reads again : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Faltering , again she looks up . Her gaze wanders once more over the crowd , to the gap in shoulders where a small boy sits , so incongruously . Who brought him ? Who is watching over him ? And who is the man further on - standing in the back - his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did she never imagine that he might come tonight ? And is love merely gratitude towards someone who could destroy you but chooses not to ? Meaning that you can not love a person once he no longer can destroy you ?

Or is there some other way , some fusion , some other form ? <p> Her gaze lingers on her husband , his face damp and clean , for he has just shaved in the men 's room at work , as he sometimes does when a thing is important to him . Go ahead , he nods again , as he has a million times , when she 's caught in a word , in a thought , in a doorway , in a jam . She looks around the room again - one last confirmation . <p> The teacher is not there . The teacher is not coming . But still , she can hear her : <p> You must feel a tug towards the linel Your passion must be broken across the formal line .
