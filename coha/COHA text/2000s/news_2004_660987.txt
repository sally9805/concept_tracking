<p> My wife 's village in the Philippines consists mostly of bamboo houses perched on hills that rise gently from the rice fields . The hills are lush , the fields neat and well-tended ; one almost forgets how poor these people are , in Western terms at least . My wife 's father gets about $ 750 a year for his crop - a lot compared with sharecroppers who have little besides the rice they eat and clothes they wear . <p> Life is not easy . Yet there is a sense of sufficiency and contentment that is not much found in the US . There is time ; daily life is not a grim march to the metronome of clocks . There is also the abundance of nature - coconut , banana , and mango trees , sweet potatoes and swamp cabbage , the chickens and goats that fill the yards . None of these appear in the stern accountings of Western economists who pronounce upon the poverty of such people . <p> Most of all , there is the rice , which is both livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have rice under the house , " my father-in-law says , " you do not have worries . " <p> The rice fields are productive in another way , too . By unspoken agreement , villagers can walk across the narrow dikes that define each farmer 's land , to get where they need to go . Private property becomes to this extent a commons ; boundaries that divide tend also to tie people together . The fields help produce community as well as rice , and this is both a reflection and reinforcement of a social cohesion that pervades daily life there . <p> No , it 's not idyllic . People being people , feuds and animosities are not unknown . But bonds of mutual supportare strong . Studies have shown that Filipinos consider themselves happy to a greater degree than their statistical poverty might suggest . I could not help thinking that those paths through the rice fields point to one reason why . <p> America was once a lot like this . The concept of property early settlers had was n't a walled fortress ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts and the whole . Early New Englanders built their towns around a commons , a shared pasture for livestock . Private woodlands were open to others for hunting or cutting wood , unless owners fenced them . <p> Water law , so important in the new land , reflected this desire for balance . You could use the water that ran through your land , but not in a way that diminished your neighbor 's use . The water belongs to all of us , the law said , and ownership has responsibilities as well as rights . <p> The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , which laid out a plan of government for what is now much of the upper Midwest , declared that the main waterways there " shall be common highways and forever free . " <p> Such thinking is n't a quaint relic of a simpler time . It 's rooted in a fundamental economic truth - namely , the symbiosis between the private and the common . <p> Private property could n't exist without a society that honors and protects it . The value of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature . Take a Park Avenue apartment , or a Cape Cod cottage , put it in a cornfield or urban slum , and you 'd better reduce the asking price . The structure is the same ; the difference is what 's around it . The real estate mantra " location , location , location " really means " gifts , gifts , gifts " - of society and nature . This is true of financial assets as well as real estate . In fact , it 's true to a degree of all human production and creation . Every invention , business technique , story , and song draws on what has come before . I could n't write this , nor you read it , without the English language - a gift to both of us . We all stand on many shoulders ; and earlier concepts of property acknowledged this . <p> Nowhere was this thinking more evident than in the realm of invention and ideas . America itself is an idea , the first nation so conceived ; so the views of the Founders on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind to be the mother lode of freedom , and they wanted no restrictions - private or public - on its fruits . The copyright and patent clause of the Constitution generally restricts these private monopolies to limited times ; and this provision is of a piece with the First Amendment protections of freedom of speech . <p> Benjamin Franklin was no slouch when it came to a dollar - yet he did n't seek patents for his numerous inventions . " As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others , we should be glad to serve others by any invention of ours , " he said . <p> There were contrary views , of course , and these soon gained the upper hand , being more congenial to moneyed interest . But the sense of affiliation with a whole persisted , in folkways as well as public policy . There were the frontier barn raisings and harvest bees in which work and time became a commons neighbors could draw from . There was the Main Street culture that combined the commercial with the social and civic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county fairgrounds and town squares throughout Illinois . <p> Democracy was n't separate from the setting in which it occurred ; and farmers and townspeople , many with little formal schooling , sat in the baking sun for hours to listen . <p> The next hundred years brought unprecedented change . Yet even as the new commercial culture wove webs of self- obsession , residues of the older thinking remained . People shopped on Main Streets . They visited with neighbors on stoops and porches . Entertainment was a social experience , at bowling alleys , movie theaters , and ball parks . Such remnants were a resource on which the nation could draw in times of need , such as World War II . When FDR declared that sacrifice in the cause of freedom was a " privilege , " and that he stood for " equality of privilege , " his words touched something Americans already believed . The top income tax bracket went up to over 90 percent , and ordinary workers paid the tax for the first time . Young men were subject to a universal draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used cooking oil and old pots and pans to supply war materiel . <p> There was grumbling and cheating to be sure . But the residents of one Kansas town probably echoed the prevailing view when they observed in a newsletter to their sons on the front : " We do not have everything we want . We do have everything we need . " <p> Today , that sentiment seems to come from another galaxy . When brave , young Americans went off to fight in Iraq , there was skittish concern in Washington that the rest of us actually might have to sacrifice something to support them . Political leaders cut taxes and urged us to go shopping . Not only is there no draft , but an increasing share of the burden is shunted to mercenaries . <p> Whatever one thought of the invasion of Iraq , when patriotism becomes a market transaction , purchased by most on the cheap , that 's cause for concern . Some will blame the ' 60s , Eastern intellectuals , and the rest . But the true source of this shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , after all , in suburbs conceived as staging areas for personal consumption rather than for social interaction . We move about in the hermetic enclosures of cars , shop in malls designed to exclude anything that might interfere with the buying mood . <p> We barricade our attention in electronic cocoons of iPods and cellphones . Family car trips once were occasions for storytelling that built a narrative bond between generations . Now kids sit in back and watch DVD 's . Then we wonder why parents have trouble communicating with kids - why we feel lonely , isolated , and depressed . <p> Step by step , the paths through our " rice fields " have become walled corridors of one . <p> A reason for today 's bitter , polarized politics is that people do n't have to talk with those they do n't agree with anymore . They just retreat into their cocoons of the like-minded where all they hear is echoes of themselves . They lose the capacity to tolerate - let alone listen to - anyone who thinks differently . <p> Common space itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial importuning . Giant Coke bottles that now stand atop the storied left field wall in Boston 's Fenway Park are more than an advertisement . They 're a symbol of dominance - a kind that extends to virtually every corner of our society . From patent claims to body parts and the gene pool , to proposals to auction off the sea , there is a pervasive grabbiness that causes the private to devolve into its linguistic root " privation . " <p> Not surprisingly , there are increasing efforts to restore balance . The environmental movement is evidence of this , as is the resistance to ads on bases at baseball games , to cellphone noise in public places , to privatizing water , and to the patenting of life . Linux , the computer operating system developed entirely through a commons on the World Wide Web , bespeaks a desire to reclaim the free open spaces of the mind , without either governmental restriction or private claim . <p> Politicians have n't paid much heed . They still talk as though life were a contest between government programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between . But that will change . <p> The quest to reclaim the commons is America 's new freedom movement , and increasingly its pursuit of happiness as well . <p> * Jonathan Rowe , a former Monitor writer , is director of the Tomales Bay Institute . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
