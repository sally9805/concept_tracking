Now You See Me ... By Rochelle Krich Random House Rochelle Krich On a Sunday morning in November , a day before the Monday Hadassah Bailor never came home , her alarm rang at five-fifty . She shut off the alarm within seconds , but her older sister , Aliza , who had returned late from a date , groaned , " C'm on , Dass , " even before she saw the clock radio 's green liquid crystal numbers , eerily bright in the dark room . Like cat 's eyes , Aliza would say , though that was probably an afterthought inspired by the Harry Potter novel lying on the nightstand between the two beds . Aliza jammed a pillow over her head . Later , with some prodding , when insignificant details assumed urgency , she remembered hearing the splash of water as Hadassah , using the white plastic tub and two-handled laver that she 'd kept at her bedside for most of her eighteen years , rinsed her hands and eyes before she murmured her waking prayers . Also with some prodding , Aliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staccato clicking of Hadassah 's fingernails on the keyboard , and the muffled drone behind the closed door of the bathroom , where Hadassah dried her long curly strawberry-blond hair , which she liked to wear loose but had secured with a black velvet scrunchy . At seven-forty Hadassah roused her three younger brothers . She helped Yonatan , the seven-year-old , find a tennis shoe and a yarmulke , both wedged between the bunk bed and the wall . While they dressed , she put snacks into brown paper bags ( she almost forgot to decorate Yonatan 's with a smiley face ) and handed the bags to the boys as they tore out the side door to their waiting carpool . Hadassah put on a buttery yellow , cable-knit hooded sweater and a gray wool skirt that revealed a few inches of slim legs encased in gray tights too warm for what promised to be an unseasonably balmy day . After prayers and breakfast ( two rice cakes , sliced red pepper , a glass of nonfat milk ) , she returned to her computer , muting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two hours later she shut the computer and went downstairs . She had slipped her black backpack , heavy with books , over her black quilted jacket and was hoisting the strap of her overnight bag , which , if anyone had checked , was packed with more than her school uniform and a change of underwear , when her mother , one hand stifling a yawn , padded into the kitchen . Nechama Bailor did n't think her daughter had seemed different that morning . " In a rush , maybe , " she said on reflection , " but teenage girls are always like that , are n't they ? " Nechama was almost certain Hadassah had kissed her good-bye . " Dassie always kisses me before she leaves , " the mother said , using the present tense from habit and hope and touching her cheek gingerly , as though she did n't want to disturb the airy brush of her daughter 's lips .

" before producing a syringe with a long needle . He then fled the scene . " The face , " my grandmother likes to say , " tells a secret . " It 's an old Yiddish proverb that I have found to be true more often than not . But you have to really see a face to read its secrets . And some faces are like masks , hardened by misery or guile to reveal nothing , or like mirrors , reflecting what you expect or want to see . If you had looked at my face that Wednesday , you might have detected loneliness . I was on an overnight book tour , and a tour , even one that 's only a two-hour drive from home , can have lonesome moments . Not during the reading , when you 're caught up in the thrill of sharing your words with people who know your name even if you do n't know theirs . And not immediately afterwards , when you may cherish the solitude and anonymity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who came to hear you are in their homes , chatting with family or friends about the day 's happenings , and you 're in your hotel or in a restaurant and everyone around you seems to be part of a couple or a group , sharing drinks or laughter-at some point you 're filled with melancholy , with a sense of being disconnected , invisible . I was in San Diego that night , in a hotel room that , though not the Del Coronado , was more than adequate , but I missed Los Angeles and the comforts and contours of my house and my bed . Mostly , I missed my husband of eight months , especially since this was the first night we 'd been apart since our wedding . So when I saw a familiar face in the lobby of my hotel , my spirits lifted . He was sitting on a sofa opposite the elevator I 'd just exited . I smiled , ready to greet him , unable to place him . His eyes were lowered toward the magazine on his lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap that obscured his forehead . I knew him . Where did I . . . ? It took a moment for his identity to register ( the other times , I realized , he 'd worn a yarmulke and no glasses ) , another for surprise to twist into shock , then alarm . He was following me . I had first noticed him Monday at my publication party for Sins of the Father , a true account of a man who had injected his son with the AIDS virus . More than half of the people at the Dutton 's Brentwood event were friends and family and , like me , Orthodox Jews , so his black suede yarmulke had been one of many . He was in his midforties , I 'd guessed , judging from the dusting of gray in his thinning light brown hair . He had kept his distance while I greeted guests and steered them to the chocolates and wine I 'd set out in the courtyard . Inside the store , he listened intently while I read from the first chapter of Sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods punctuating my sentences and making me flush with pleasure at his approval-or maybe it was the wine . Later , he joined the advancing queue of people holding books for me to sign . I was certain he would comment on the book or my reading , but he set a copy of Sins in front of me , said , " Signature only " in a low voice , and slipped away before I could ask his name . Tuesday afternoon he was in the back row of chairs in a Thousand Oaks mystery bookstore . He listened with that same flattering concentration while I spoke about the research I 'd done for the book , about the people I 'd interviewed , the conclusions I 'd reached . After my talk he was the first to approach me , a copy of Sins in his hand . Maybe he was a collector , I 'd thought . Collectors often buy two copies of a hardcover-one for their collection , another to read-though they generally buy both at the same time . Or maybe he was picking up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again , " I said , smiling warmly as he handed me the book . " Do you live in the city or the Valley ? " I continued when he did n't reply . His was the only yarmulke in the room , and I admit I felt a kinship . " City . " His curt tone did n't invite conversation . So much for " kinship . " Uncapping my pen , I turned to the title page . " What 's your name ? " " Signature only , please . " With someone else I might have quipped that it was an odd name , but I did n't think he 'd appreciate the humor . He sounded somber . Nervous , too , now that I look back . " Would you like me to write the date ? " I asked . " Please . " I wrote " Morgan Blake " ( my pseudonym for my true crime books ) , " November 16 , " and the year . In my byline-I 'm a freelance reporter and pen a weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my real name , Molly Blume . ( Molly Blume Abrams since I married Zack , my former high school sweetheart , who is now a pulpit rabbi . ) He showed up that night at the Mystery Bookstore in Westwood . From my stool behind the tall black desk at the rear of the store , I saw him hovering near a front table , leafing through books and darting glances in my direction . On some level I was flattered , but I kept my eye on him while I chatted with people and signed copies of Sins . Minutes later he was standing in front of me . " Signature and date only , right ? " I opened the book he handed me . " I take it you 're a collector ? " He seemed surprised by my question . " No . " " Then you really are a fan . I wish I had dozens like you . " I wondered if he was giving the copies as gifts for Chanukah , which was only weeks away , or for Christmas . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination , your integrity . It all comes through in the book . " " Thank you . " It was the most he 'd said since we 'd met-practically a speech-and I was struck again by the gravity of his tone . " What 's your name , by the way ? " " Reuben . " He stepped closer and leaned over the desk . " Can I buy you a cup of coffee when you 're done ? " I assumed he wanted advice about getting published , or a critique of his work , or both . I try to repay the kindness others have shown me on my road to publication , but the man 's intensity made me cautious . " I wish I could , but my husband is waiting for me , " I said , grateful for the excuse and the man who provided it . " What about tomorrow morning ? " he said with an urgency that confirmed my wariness . " I need to discuss something with you . It 's important . " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I smiled to soften the rejection . " I know , but- " He stopped , then scribbled a phone number on a slip of paper that he pushed towards me . " In case you change your mind , " he said , and turned to leave . " You forgot your book . " I held it out to him . His third copy . I love devoted fans , but I read Misery and saw the movie . So in spite of the yarmulke-no guarantee of character , and for all I knew it was camouflage ; anyone could buy one-I asked the store manager to accompany me to my car , and I did n't fully relax until I was home . " Three signings in two days , and two on the same day ? " Zack said after I 'd told him about my new fan . " He probably wanted writing advice , or a referral to my agent . Or a blurb . " My caution seemed silly now that I was nestled in the crook of Zack 's arm , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not its appeal . " Did you keep the phone number he gave you ? " I found the scrap of paper in my purse and handed it to Zack . He dialed the number , listened , and hung up a moment later . " No name , just a recorded message . Three books , huh ? " The expression in his gray-blue eyes had turned pensive . " I think he was trying to butter me up . " " Maybe . So are you going to call the guy ? " " No . " Zack was trying to sound casual , but I could hear his concern . My ex-husband , Ron , would have told me what to do-or , in this case , not do . " Now if he 'd bought four books , " I said , and we both laughed . I did n't feel like laughing now . Less than a minute had passed since I 'd stepped out of the elevator , and the man still was n't aware of my presence . Common sense told me to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety net of potential rescuers propelled me across the marble floor . The clacking of my heels echoed loudly in the high-ceilinged lobby . His head whipped up from the magazine , and he jumped to his feet , smoothing his startled expression and his navy sports coat . He was about four inches taller than my five-six , but my Jimmy Choos erased the difference . My heart was thumping . " You 're stalking me , " I said , raising my voice to attract the attention of the guests in the next bay of sofas . " I want to know why . " Color worked up his neck like a spider 's web . " I 'm really sorry . I did n't mean to frighten you , Miss Blume . As I told you last night , I need to talk to you . It 's urgent . " " Well , you did frighten me . " I was n't surprised that he knew my real name-practically everyone at the Dutton 's signing had called me Molly . But I was n't thrilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Reuben Jastrow . " " Show me some ID , Reuben Jastrow . " Tucking the magazine under his arm , he removed a wallet from the pocket of his gray wool slacks and handed it to me . I examined his driver 's license . Same name , same face , a little less gray in the hair . He was forty-eight , several years older than I 'd guessed . I fished a pen and pad out of my purse and made a show of writing down his name , driver 's license number , and an address in Beverlywood , an upscale neighborhood near Beverly Hills . " Why are you stalking me ? " I repeated after I returned his wallet . " I wasn't- " He glanced around . " Can we talk somewhere private ? " My heart was still racing . My stomach muscles were knotted . " I do n't think so . Right now I find crowds really appealing . Why the disguise , Reuben ? " He looked confused . " The disguise ? " I pointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glasses . You were n't wearing them the other times . " He lifted his cap and revealed a black suede yarmulke . " My contact lenses are monovision . One is for reading , the other for distance , " he said , replacing the cap . " They 're okay , but not perfect , especially at night , when I 'd be on my way back to L.A. " His explanation rang true-my mother wears monovision contacts and complains about their limitations . But that did n't mean it was true . " What shul do you go to , Reuben ? " He named an Orthodox synagogue in Beverlywood . " Who 's the rabbi ? " I asked , testing him . He told me that , too . " You can ask around about me , although I 'd prefer you did n't . We do n't want talk . " " We ? " The word had a vaguely conspiratorial sound . " My family . This is a delicate matter . " I raised a brow . " Stalking me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching us . Now he approached and folded his arms . " Is this guy bothering you ? " he asked me , glowering at Jastrow and the magazine , which Jastrow had twisted into a tight roll . Hardly a lethal weapon , even if words can kill . " No , I 'm fine , " I told my defender . " Thanks , though . " " Okay , then . " He seemed disappointed and gave Jastrow a long warning look before he walked away .
