Further adventures of Rick Renard . A short story // It had been one of those weeks . Monday I got the news that I would not be landing the juicy new account repping the Emirate of Matar . Matar was trying to improve its image in the United States , which needed some buffing because six of its citizens had been apprehended trying to set off that radioactive device in the New York subway . That was Monday . Wednesday I arrived in the office to the marvelous news that a pilot for an airline I represent had tried to fly a jumbo jet from Chicago to Paris while drunk . The air-traffic controllers ordered him back to the gate after he started singing " Somewhere Over the Rainbow " as the plane taxied for takeoff . I issued a statement highlighting the fact that the co-pilot was a Mormon and would have been able to land the plane safely . In public relations you live with the reality that not every disaster can be made to look like a misunderstood triumph . So I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was someone with a pronounced English accent on the phone who would n't give his name but was " most insistent " that he speak with me . Frankly , I almost did n't take the call . I do n't want to give the impression that I 'm one of those snooty types who stand on ceremony . On the contrary . Ask around and they 'll tell you that Renard Strategic Communications is a " people " firm . To us , a client is not just a source of endless billable hours ( though he is also that ) but a soul in need , whether it 's a soul who has just been charged with insider trading or one whose product has poisoned some watershed and made an entire species extinct ( usually some type of frog that really no one aside from biologists with too much time on their hands is going to miss ) . Anyway , I took the call . The accent identified itself as a Lord Sir Knatchbull Fogg-Smythers . Hard not to feel a bit inadequate after that . Still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has passed down through the generations from the first Rick Renard , Richard le Renard , who performed an incredibly valiant deed during some twelfth-century battle . We 're not clear on the details , but apparently he was quite a guy . " I 'm calling on rather a delicate matter , " he said . " Mr. Figg-Smothers , " I said , " Smogg-Fithers ... " Those hyphenated British names can be murder if you 're a bit dyslexic . " Fogg-Smythers , " he said , frosting my phone with a coat of ice . " How may I be of assistance , Sir Lord ? " I said . " Your name has come up . I 'm calling by way of preliminary enquiry to see if you might come over to London . I believe you will find it quite worth your while . " " May I ask , Lord Sir , what this concerns ? " " The survival of the British monarchy . " You ca n't just say " I guess I could squeeze you in next Wednesday between three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . He then asked if I would be flying " privately or commercially . ' ' " Before I knew it , I was telling him that- " of course " -I would be flying in " my own plane , " though the closest I 've ever come to that was a balsa-wood glider when I was eleven . Sir Lord did n't sound the least bit impressed . He just sniffed , " Much easier all round , " as though I 'd spared him the indignity of having someone meet me at the baggage claim . He said to have my pilot land at Brightfarthing UAF Base , in Wallopshire . " I 'll arrange it so they do n't shoot you down . " I hung up thinking , Well done , Renard-you 've just spent $25,000 of your own money trying to impress someone named Knatchbull . I summoned LaMoyne . LaMoyne is my executive assistant . I gloomily instructed him to arrange for the cheapest fractional-ownership jet he could find that stood a sporting chance of making it from here to England . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugged out of their sockets and his bow tie twirled like a pinwheel . " The Lord Sir Knatchbull Fogg-Smythers ? " he gasped . // " No , the other Lord Sir Knatchbull Fogg-Smythers . Who the hell is he , anyway ? He sounds like he sat on his sword at some coronation ceremony and never had it removed . " His voice dropped to a whisper . " He 's the private secretary to the Prince of Wales " " Well , whoop-de-do , " I said , still fuming over the plane . LaMoyne reads that British magazine Hello ! , the one that chronicles royal happenings like they were second Comings . One issue I saw open on his desk had a twelve-page color spread under the headline " THE COUNTESS OF PUDDINCTON SPENDS AN EXHILARATING AFTERNOON JUDGING HENS AT AN AGRICULTURAL FAIR AND AFTERWARD ENJOYS TEA WITH HER COUSIN THE MARCHIONESS OF WOOLHAMPTON AT HER 152-ROOM ANCESTRAL HOME , GLAND MANOR . " I could hardly put it down . LaMoyne ca n't get enough of this sort of stuff . He memorizes royal-family trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uncle was related to Queen Victoria 's aunt and what kind of hemophilia he had . LaMoyne grew up in Indiana . His father managed a cement factory ; his mother taught high school English . People like LaMoyne tend to leave Indiana as soon as they attain legal age , and head west or east until they reach the continental shelf . I suppose you ca n't blame them . I told him what the subject of the meeting with Lord Sir was . He sniffed , " The monarchy could use some saving . " I was n't really up on the latest royal catastrophe . There seemed to be at least one a week . Something was always going wrong with that dynasty . I read somewhere that a Hungarian monk two centuries ago put a curse on it . You 're not off to a good start as a dynasty when you have monks putting curses on you unto the tenth generation . While not a royal-watcher myself , I was aware that the Prince of Wales had recently shot a beater accidentally during a driven-pheasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could walk , or limp , out of the emergency room , he made a beeline for the nearest tabloid newspaper , where he sold a Homeric account of the peppering of his hindquarters for 200,000 . ( Headline : " DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BLOODY PHEASANT , SIR ? " ) If I 'd been handling His Royal Highness 's affairs at the time , I 'd have put out the word that the man practically hurled himself in front of the Prince so that he could cash in . Sometimes , in PR , you have to take off the old gloves . I told LaMoyne he could brief me on royalty on the way over . Needless to say , he was beside himself with excitement to be coming along . When , that evening , we boarded the jet , a hideously expensive six-seater that would have to put down in Iceland to refuel , he had three suitcases with him . " Those are going to cost me an extra thousand dollars in fuel . " " They 're not for me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd apparently gone out and bought me a trousseau . " What 's that ? " I pointed to a white box with a seethrough lid . " It 's a boutonniere , " he said . " LaMoyne , I 'm not going to a prom , for God 's sake . " " They notice these things . Trust me . " LaMoyne briefed me on royal matters as we flew over Newfoundland . I was getting to know as much about the House of Windsor as your average Hello ! reader . I even felt some sympathy for the Prince of Wales . It ca n't be that bad a life . He 's richer than most Arab sheikhs . He has someone on his palace staff who irons the five-pound notes he puts in the Sunday collection plate-this being the only money he spends , since London head-waiters apparently know not to present him with the check . He also has someone on staff to hold the specimen cup for him while he 's providing royal urine samples . By most standards this would qualify as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in some ways an aimless existence . His only job , really , is to become King when his mother dies . But the women in his family live longer than Galapagos tortoises . At this rate he wo n't be King until he 's so old he 'll be getting up five times in the middle of the night to provide royal specimens . Not much fun for the guy who has to hold the cup . Maybe he gets hardship pay . HRH 's track record is , frankly , mixed . There was the disastrous marriage , the taped telephone conversation with his mistress in which he told her he wanted to be reincarnated as her-well , I 'm sure you heard all about it . Must have been fun to read that in his morning newspaper . These moments of glory were followed by an endless series of serve-and-tell memoirs by palace butlers , footmen , grooms , garbage men . You wonder why everyone in England does n't apply to work in the palace . The latest memoir included the news that the dead Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , draining the brake fluid . One third of the British people believed it , apparently . No wonder HRH 's approval rating was in the single digits . Most British people did n't even want him to become King ; they could n't wait for the crown to go to his twenty-one-year-old son . You can be 100 percent American-as I certainly am-and still feel a bit sorry for a constipated monarch who 's losing a popularity contest to his kid and whose mother is the Energizer Bunny of queens . By the time we landed at Brightfarthing , LaMoyne had got me up to speed . I could tell you how many kids George V had and which of them stuttered . His son George VI had such a problem that they had a doctor standing by at his coronation with a hypodermic needle full of amphetamines , ready to stick him if he stalled at " I , G-g-g-g-g . " Poor guy . Apparently he never even wanted to be King , but his brother-that would be Edward VIII-fell in love with Mrs. Simpson , who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought my family was odd . " Do n't shake hands , " LaMoyne said . " They hate touching . They think it 's vulgar and American . And do n't introduce yourself by name . Just nod slightly and act as though you 'd rather be somewhere else . If they offer you something to drink , ask for a medium sherry and take teensy sips . " " Can I blow my nose on the drapes ? I 'm not some barbarian from the steppes , damnit . " LaMoyne 's briefing stood me in good stead during the interview with Lord Sir Knatchbull Fogg-Smythers . He received me-one is received-in his study at Wheaters , the Prince 's estate near Least Cudding . I do n't know where they get the names . He extended his hand . Naturally , I withheld mine and just smiled thinly . He seemed relieved not to have to touch me . " His Royal Highness has concluded that the time has come to take a more aggressive stance with respect to press relations , " he said . " Um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Prince 's employ that you can get through most conversations in England by just saying " Um . " They prefer to do all the talking anyway , and really do n't care what you think . Every so often you throw in a frown to show that you have n't had so many Botox injections that you can no longer register facial expressions . " Of course , " he said , " we do n't think it would be judicious to be seen to be employing a foreign firm for this sort of thing . So you would be functioning from rather behind the arras , as it were . " He chuckled dryly . " Arras " is not a word that comes up every day at Renard Strategic Communications , but I caught Sir Lord 's drift . I later learned from LaMoyne that it 's some kind of curtain that Shakespeare 's characters are always running their swords through-an Elizabethan pinata . As it were . At this point the door opened , and in walked HRH in the flesh , looking like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaters . He could n't have been more gracious . He thanked me for coming all this way , hoped they were taking good care of me-must be jolly jet-lagged , and what about this rotten English weather ? LaMoyne had told me , " If you meet him , do n't say anything to him . You 're not supposed to initiate conversation . " He was adamant about it . So I stood there while the Prince went on about nothing in particular . Finally he stopped and stared at me . I wondered if he was waiting for me to unzip the royal fly and hold out a cup . Then he murmured something to Lord Sir , who frowned , and HRH suggested that the two of us " go for a tromp . " I blurted , " As long as you do n't bring a shotgun . " Lord Sir looked like he was going to shoot me himself , but HRH just laughed politely and said they had some medieval armor that I could wear if that would make me feel safer . Awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . This is n't always the case with my clients , who have included some pretty fruity characters , as they say in England . While we tromped , HRH told me that it had been his idea to hire me . He 'd read about my effort to get an American cardinal elected Pope and the celebrity pro-am golf tournament I 'd staged in North Korea . He said I was " rum . " He was painfully aware of his own bad press . " I just ca n't seem to put a foot right , " he said . " And now they all want me to abdicate-before I 've even sat on the throne . " My heart went out to the man . He said , " Do you know why I wanted to talk to you out here , alone ? They listen in . The gray men . With tape recorders . It 's a nightmare ? A look of pain came over his face . " That ghastly business with the cell phones . " Suddenly I saw him not as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being who felt not particularly great at having had his wish to be reincarnated as his mistress 's Tampax broadcast to the world . I myself have not entertained that particular fantasy , but if I had , I 'm pretty sure I would n't want to read about it in USA Today . " I 've come to wonder if they do n't have it in for me , " he said . He stood there on the moor , looking like Heathcliff only not as handsome and with bigger ears . " It 's almost as if they want me to fail . " " Sir ' ' " I said , the time having come to say something more than " Um , " " with all due respect , we need to take the bull by the horns . You 've been playing defense . It 's time to kick ass . " You 're probably not supposed to use words like that with royals . But when I looked over at him , he was chewing his lower lip thoughtfully , and I detected a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Um , " he said . Historically , you have to be careful interpreting royal gestures , or before you know it you 're slicing up archbishops in the cathedral . But it sounded like he was giving me the green light . As we tromped back to Wheaters through the fog , he brought up the fact that his grandmother had lived to the age of 101 , and his great-grandmother Queen Mary to the age of eighty-five , and his **29;2118;TOOLONG Queen Victoria to the age of eighty-two . He did n't sound thrilled by this longevity . " Long live the Queen and all that , " he sighed , " but the people might be a bit more excited by the idea of Charles III if he did n't look like an Egyptian mummy when he assumed the throne . Do n't you think ? " I said to myself , Tread carefully , Renard . We were being trailed at a distance by two of his Special Branch bodyguards . What with all the taping going on , who knew if they had long-range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIT MAX TO " MURDER " QUEEN . " " Have you discussed with your dear mother . " I said , sounding like some brown-nosing courtier , " her thoughts with respect to , um , abdication ? " " Her Majesty has made her views on that subject abundantly clear , he said with a grunt . " Au meme temps , " he went on , " were she to become a ligure of ridicule , as I have been , then her views might moderate . He gave me a sly look , like Henry II asking the staff , " Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest ? " " We have the same situation with my mother , " I said , laughing . " We 've been trying to get her to move into an assisted-living home , but she wo n't budge . " HRH looked at me . " Well , hardly . " As his **29;2149;TOOLONG would have said , " We are not amused . " Before we got bark to Wheaters , he said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust , with very good connections . She 's rather a bit of all right . " You need a glossary witli Brits . LaMoyne was standing in the gravel driveway , clearly hoping to catch a glimpse of HRH . He swooned when we walked up . T know I saw LaMoyne curtsy , though he denies it . " What the hell was it . then ? " I said to him in the plane as we ( lew back across the Atlantic at a cost of $18 per mile . " My knee . Sometimes it locks . I 'd been standing there for hours . " Whatever ! " I said . " Well , your idol His Royal Highness wants me to take down his mother ! " " Oh , dear , " LaMoyne said . We were back in England ten days later-by commercial carrier-and set up shop in a suite of offices a discreet distance from Pituitary House , HRH 's London residence . Lord Sir sent over a couple of Oxbridge-type dons to educate me on the history of Princes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was which PoWs were successes and which ones had tanked . The dons kept bleating , " But Mr. Renard , they did n't take polls in the eighteenth century . " I said , " Well , maybe if they had , you would n't have lost America and India . " The second day a very attractive woman in her mid-thirties showed up with skin like porcelain and a figure like one of those Creek statues in the British Museum . Long eyelashes , too . which I have personally always been a sticker for . " Serena Tompkins , " she said . " I believe you re expecting me . Mr. Fitzwater sent me ? " " Fitzwater " was our code name for HRH . She 'd been one of his Special Branch bodyguards , and had done a lot of the advance work for his foreign trips . She was plugged in to MI5 and M16 ( their version of our FBI and CIA ) . She was now a private security consultant . She seemed loyal to HRH and " livid " -a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleet Street " hacks and parasites . " She seemed so loyal to and admiring of him , in fact , that the thought did cross my mind that it might be more than your standard monarch-subject relationship . " I 'm a bit nervous about all this . Your being American . Rather awkward if it got out . " " You know , ma'am , " I said a little wearily , " it 's impressive how one British person can make the word " American " sound more damning than a crowd of Middle Easterners screaming " Great Satan . " What is it about us that bugs you so ? Aside from the fact that we re overweight , vulgar , arrogant , and ignorant ? " " Sorry . Did n't mean to start off on the wrong foot . " " No big deal . I 'll be the crass American , you be the tight-assed Brit . So who s been taping our Mr. Fitzwater and leaking stuff to the tabs ? I do n't get it . He 's the Prince of Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his squeeze ? Is this normal in a monarchy ? Do they do this in Belgium and Denmark ? " We do n't know for sure who did the taping , " she said . " It is possible the security services were involved . " " Well , you work on that . I 'll concentrate on relaunching the product . " " He 's not some new brand of cereal . " she said . " Assuming it was MI5 or 6 , what is it about him they do n't like ? I know he 's got old-fashioned ideas about city planning . Was it that speech he gave in Paris , where he came out against the British position on GATT , in favor of French farmers ? That was n't very popular , as I recall . ' " It caused a huge stir . But I ca n't imagine the government would have retaliated with such vehemence . " " He could have started a trade war and screwed up the entire world economy . What was he thinking ? " " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively . From the heart . " " Well , no more speeches for our boy in favor of French farmers . I 'll tell Lord Sir Knatchbull . Speaking of which-is he on the level ? " " On the level ? Do you mean a Mason ? " " No . Is he on our side ? " " Of course . He was at Gordonstoun with the Prince . " " Does that mean they had sex ? I know how it is in English schools . " Really . Mr. Renard . I-have n't the slightest idea . I should very much doubt it . " " Well , let 's check his phone records for the past , say , ten years . See if he 's been yakking it up with Fleet Street or MI5 or 6 . " " That 's rather a tall order . Mr. Renard . To say nothing of being highly illegal . " " Well , then , you 'd rather better get going . Ought n't you , Ms. Tompkins ? " She huffed out of my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , practically knocking over LaMoyne , who 'd been pouring sherry into the dons and grilling them on fourteenth-century attitudes toward Princes of Wales . The next two weeks-fortnight , as the British would say-were a period of intense activity . We did focus groups up and down the sceptered isle , from way up in York , where you can barely understand what the hell they 're saying , down to Kent , where they are slightly more intelligible . I wanted a broad cross-section of the population , but the idea of rustling me up some nobles gave Lord Sir a case of shingles . He was convinced that it would leak to the press . But I held firm , and in the end I got a couple of old duchesses and something called a viscount ( you do n't pronounce the s , which I learned by putting my foot in my mouth ) behind the one-way mirror . LaMoyne wired them up for galvanic skin responses and breathing . " Will it hurt ? " " Not at all , Your Grace , " LaMoyne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should have been a butler . " It 's simply to measure your response to the questions . " " How very exciting . " We focused more than 2,000 people , from every walk of British life : mine workers , gamekeepers , curry chefs , soccer hooligans , shoe bombers , a couple of cross-dressing members of Parliament , a retired army colonel , punk rockers , poachers , an IRA kneecapper , a bobby ( policeman ) , a fishmonger , a gaol guard , a Gurkha , junkies , footmen , a lot of transplanted Arabs-one of whom claimed to own Harrods , the big store , and kept insisting that my client had ordered MI6 to kill his ex-wife . Good thing he did n't know what I was up to . Anyway , very interesting , the Brits . I have to say , a bit more varied than your average Iowa or Florida focus group . I came away with quite an appreciation for the country , though I do n't think I 'd want to get seriously sick there , to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder it 's free of charge . You have to schedule - or , as they would say . shed-yule-your serious illnesses months in advance , and when you get there , the CAT-scan machine has an OUT OF SERVICE sign on it . At any rate , by the end we had a very good statistical sample . I do n't like shooting from the hip when I 'm promoting monarchy . LaMoyne and I pulled consecutive all-nighters getting it together for our PowerPoint presentation to HRH . Lord Sir wanted us to rehearse it with him first , but I nixed that . I did n't want him telling me . " You ca n't tell His Royal Highness that . " In fact , I did n't even want him to hear what I had to tell HRH . If you 've got tough news for the client , there 's no point sugarcoating . One of my previous clients was the manufacturer of the guidance system on that geosynchronous ( in the end , not so geosynchronous ) three-ton satellite that landed on Kansas City . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company , a decent enough guy , that the latest Gallup poll showed he was now the most hated person in America . But he needed to hear that . HRH was n't going to like a lot of what was in my presentation . But I had a plan . If you have to tell a client that his approval ratings are in the basement , it 's always better if you can hand him a flashlight and point him toward the stairs . I called Lord Sir and told him that I was ready to go . And that I wanted to give it to HRH straight up and alone , just the two of us . He did n't like that idea at all . He insisted that he be present-said it was a point of " protocol . " They get very nervous , courtiers , if you want to spend some quality time alone with the fromage . I called Ms. Tompkins , who said she was in the bowels of some government building looking up phone records . I told her to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask to speak to me alone after the presentation , if possible out of earshot of any " gray men . " " It all sounds rather conspiratorial , " she said . " But I 'll pass it along . " Lord Sir and HRH did n't say a word while I walked them through my presentation . It was not easy telling the heir to the throne that after thirty-five years of hard work-604 public appearances in the previous year alone-most of his subjects thought that he had murdered his wife and wanted to be reincarnated as a tampon . I told him we were going to have to confront the tampon business . One maker of tampons in Singapore was using his face on its billboards next to the slogan " In my next life , I want to be one of these ! " The British Foreign Office was making an official stink about it , but all that did was keep it in the newspapers . And the brand was now the No. 1 seller in the Far East . Go figure . I went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes . The good news was that he was doing pretty well in Wiltshire and Stiltonshire among **31;2180;TOOLONG . I wrapped it up by saying I was working on a media plan . Lord Sir said , " Is that all ? " with the air of a disappointed headmaster . " Well , " I said , catching HRH 's eye , " for now . " " I must say , Mr. Renard , you have n't told us anything we did n't already know . " I sort of hemmed and hawed , at which point HRH said he wanted to talk to me alone . Lord Sir did n't seem at all pleased by that , but there was n't much he could do about it . It 's one of the advantages of being a Prince : you get to dismiss people . In the old days , in fact , they had to walk backward . When we were alone , I hit him with my big idea . HRH may talk to his rosebushes and have some fruity ideas about international trade , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift right away . He told me to get right to work . I urged him to keep it to himself , and for God 's sake-sir-not to discuss it on the cell phone with the mistress . He said not to worry , he 'd learned that lesson . Then he asked me if I had any ideas about how to get the Queen to step down . I said let 's start with this first and then start planting stories in the press about how his mother was having orgies with the postilions . I called the director Reg Gibbins , reaching him in his home town of Sydney , Australia . I had to do some fancy talking to get past his guard dogs , but when you say you 're calling on behalf of HRH , the doors tend to swing open . Reg Gibbins , I do n't need to explain , is the award-winning Australian director who was adapting Alistair Squinch novels about the British navy during the Napoleonic wars . The second movie in the series , Rum , Sodomy , and the Lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titled Topgallants and Trysails . ) I had had LaMoyne speed-read the novels , all twenty-one of them . He said there was more than enough room in the basic story line to add the part I had in mind . It would n't have to be a huge speaking part , so long as HRH got to skewer French sailors with a saber . The bottom line of my extensive research with the Oxbridge dons and the focus groups was that the English people value one quality above all else in their monarchs : killing the French . One of the most successful early Princes of Wales was Edward , the Black Prince ( great title ) , who in the year 1356 , at the Battle of Poitiers , cut the army of the French King John II to ribbons , and into the bargain took a bunch of Parisian aristos back to England as hostages . Man , those were the days ! All that remained of that era in England was the quality of health care . I was convinced that when British audiences saw HRH up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and running the Frogs through like cocktail olives , they 'd leap to their feet and start singing " God Save the King . " ( And , who knows , maybe even demand that the Queen abdicate , so that Charles III could get started waging war against France . ) When I presented the idea to HRH , he went for it . He said he 'd " crept the boards a bit " at Cambridge . I had to look that up afterward . I gather his younger brother has done a little creeping himself . Reg Gibbins was , shall we say , surprised by my call-indeed , blown away . In fact , he hung up , figuring I was a crank . I called him back and starchily said , " Look here , my good man , I can take this to Spielberg or Disney if you 're not interested in having a live Prince of England in your next movie . " He said to jump on a plane and come on down and discuss it . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up here and discuss it . Will you be flying privately or commercially ? " I was getting the hang of this royal-summons thing . Needless to say , he did have his own plane . I told him HRH and I would meet him at Brightfarthing , and we 'd do lunch at Wheaters . He was thrilled-and why should n't he be ? This was a pretty inspired bit of casting , if I do say so myself . I woke up the next morning full of puissance and vinegar , as the Brits would say . Not to thump my chest , but here I was , a humble PR flack from the Colonies , about to engineer just the greatest comeback in British royal history since Prince Hal became Henry V. I was feeling pretty good . At which point my phone rang . It was LaMoyne . " Look out your window at the newsstand across the street , " he said . I looked out . A poster next to a stack of papers announced in large letters , PRINCE HIRES YANK SPIN DOCTOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rang again . I picked it up , slightly dazed . I had n't even had my coffee . It was the manager , saying that there was " rather " - the Brits ca n't seem to get through a sentence without that word " a large group of reporters and photographers " in the lobby , " clamoring . " As a professional media wrangler , I 'm accustomed to swarms of these locusts . But this was far from the norm and even further from ideal . I called Ms. Tompkins . " Perfide Albion ! " I said . ( You do n't get to say this very often . ) I explained the situation . " Oh , dear . Stay where you are ; I 'll manage something . " " Better manage a helicopter . And call Mr. Fitzwater . Who the hell leaked this ? " " I was able to insinuate myself electronically into the palace phone system . No easy feat , let me tell you . There was rather a flurry of phone chatter yesterday right after your meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Numerous phone calls . From Fogg-Smythers 's office . To various newspaper offices , I 'm afraid . " " The swine ! I told you . " " I 'm afraid that 's not the half of it . He made another call first . I ca n't say any more over this phone . I 'll explain in person . " Just then there was a knock on my door , and it did n't sound like a maid . I looked through the peephole and counted three photographers . They must have seen my dilating pupil through the other end , because they started shouting , " Rick ! " " Mr. Renard ! " " Come on out , mate ! " and " Be a sport ! " " Stay in your room , " Serena said . " Get dressed and be ready to move . Leave your luggage . The signal will be four knocks on the door followed by two . By the way , I did tell you , did n't I ? " " What ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An hour later I heard a scuffle outside my door-the pleasing sound of paparazzi being beaten about the head and shoulders . I opened the door to find a half dozen plainclothes beefeaters . Collectively they must have weighed nearly a ton . " Mr. Renard , is it ? Care to accompany us , sir ? " They hustled me down the fire stairs . Photographers kept popping out of doors , like skeletons on an amusement-park ride , and being shoved back by my scrum of protectors . We got to a basement garage . The next thing I knew , I was lying on the floor of an SUY having a blanket thrown over me to the sound of screeching tires . I 've made more dignified exits in my day . " Where are we going ? " I said from underneath my blanket . " RAF base , sir . Not too far . Can you breathe under there ? " After an hour or so of violent swerving so as to lose our press pursuers , we arrived at an air base . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A female voice said , " You look like you 've been through it . " Serena . " You could probably use some coffee , " she said . " Your plane 's just finishing up being fueled . " She nodded toward a C-130 cargo plane , and smiled apologetically . " Rather easier all round , we thought . Under the circumstances . " " We ? " " His Royal Highness . He said to tell you that he is most appreciative of everything you 've done . This rather confirms what we 've suspected . The origin of the leaks , that is . " " Which we ? " I said . " I 'm confused . " " We are speaking confidentially ? " " Yes . " I was carsick from all the swerving and lying on the floor . " I 'm not actually in the private sector , " she said . " I 'm with MI7 . " " MI7 ? " " We were set up to oversee MI5 and MI6 . All rather sub rosa . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't have the security services broadcasting pillow talk between the future sovereign and his lady friends . At first we thought it might be the work of a rogue anti-monarchist element within MIS . Au contraire , as it turned out . " " Could you stick to English ? " I said . " I 've had a rough morning . " " I need your assurance that this will remain private . It 's terribly sensitive information . " " Yeah , yeah , yeah . " " Sir Knatch made a call to Buckingham Palace before he loosed the dogs of Fleet Street on you . Look , this is delicate . " " If one more person tells me it 's delicate , I 'm going to start breaking things , " I said . " He called Her Majesty . " " HRH 's mother ? " " Um . It rather confirms what we 'd come to suspect . She 's the one behind the leaks . " " But why ? " " She thinks he 's made rather a mess of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the divorce , the romantic carryings-on , nearly starting a global trade war over a few smelly French farmers . She and he have never been what you 'd call close . Point is , she thinks he 's a disaster and that the Windsor dynasty will collapse if he ever becomes King . She can read polls too . She wants the crown to skip a gento her grandson Prince William . He 's enormously popular . She thinks he 's just the thing to put the " Great " back in " Great Britain . ' ' " " Well , that 's just swell . His own mother . What is this , the Middle Ages ? " " As monarch , one does have to make the hard decisions . Goes with all the gold leaf . But maybe your clever film notion will do the trick . Have them all clamoring for him to take the throne . Jolly exciting . " " How did you know about the movie ? " I said . " The only person I told was HRH . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me . Said how very thrilled he was and how absolutely brilliant you are . " " Ready , Ms. Tompkins . " " Thank you , sergeant . Well , bon voyage , Mr. Renard . Splendid working with you . Hope we will again soon . " She gave me a kiss-a peck , really-and that was that . It 's loud inside a C-130 , and cold . I was not in a particularly good mood when I was deposited at an air base in Newfoundland , eight hours later . But never let it be said that Rick Renard does not go the distance for a client . You 've probably seen the movie . It 's grossed over $200 million . That being the case , you are probably also aware that the role I originally proposed to the director-that double-dealing swine-ended up being played by my client 's son , for whom there is now a huge " clamor , " as Serena would put it to become King of England . I admit it 's a dramatic moment , when Prince William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indubitable onto the French ship , looking drop-dead gorgeous in his nineteenth-century Royal British Navy uniform , swinging his saber , firing his pistol into a mob of Frogs , and crying " Death to Bony ! " They had to carry fainting teenage girls out of the movie theaters on stretchers . There has n't been screaming like that since the Beatles . Here is what I have been able to piece together . First , Serena was not working for MI7 . There is no MI7 . If this does not reflect well on Rick Renard , okay . Better you appear a chump than your client , I 've always said . I still do n't know exactly who Serena was working for , but I strongly suspect that she was reporting all along to Her Majesty Queen Cruella . What I do know is that when Reg Gibbins 's plane put down at Brightfarthing , a car was waiting for him , all right-but not HRH 's . He was driven to Balmoral instead , where he was ushered into a room hung with a hundred antlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And who should be with her but Prince Good-Looking . William , that is . Reg took one look and said , " I do n't suppose you 'd be available for the part , sir ? " And the Queen , she just smiled . Now the kid 's bigger than Brad Pitt , and the latest rumor , according to Hello ! , is that the Queen is going to step down in his favor as soon as he 's got his Screen Actors Guild card . What a disaster . So let me be the first to admit that this did not work out as I had planned . LaMoyne is on Zoloft for depression . As for my former client I 'm guessing that he is not thrilled , to gather from this invitation that has just arrived from St. James 's Palace , inviting me to a driven-pheasant shoot . Under the circumstances I think I 'm going to pass . Sidebar It 's in some ways an aimless existence . The Prince 's only job , really , is to become King when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live longer than Galapagos tortoises . Sidebar " I 've come to wonder if they do n't have it in for me , " HRH said . He stood there on the moor , looking like Heathcliff only not as handsome and with bigger ears . Sidebar HRH was n't going to like my presentation . But I had a plan . If a client 's ratings are in the basement , it 's always better if you can hand him a flashlight and point him toward the stairs .
