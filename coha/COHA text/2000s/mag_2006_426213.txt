The editors interview Paula D'Arcy // In 1975 the unthinkable happened : Paula D'Arcy lost her husband , Roy , and 21month-old daughter , Sarah , after a drunk driver hit their car . Pregnant at the time , Paula survived-only to be plunged into excruciating grief over her loss . As painful as it was , D'Arcy now recognizes that grieving was the best thing that has ever happened to her . Learning to let go and recognizing that all of life is fragile led to a radical spiritual transformation that enabled her to see her Catholic faith in a new light . Now she dedicates her life to helping others with their grief . She writes , gives retreats , and has created the Red Bird Foundation to help those in prison , shelters , and poor countries . Her books include Song for Sarah : A Mother 's Journey through Grief and Beyond ( Harold Shaw , 1979 ) , Gift of the Red Bird ( Crossroad , 1996 ) , and her latest , When People Grieve ( Crossroad , 2005 ) . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just returned from Louisiana , where she had led grief groups for survivors of Hurricane Katrina . Photograph Photograph // After the death of your husband and daughter , what did you learn in your grieving ? I feel in many ways like I did n't even begin to have faith until after the accident . Before that , faith was a heady , intellectual collection of beliefs . The questions I asked in my grief-What is the meaning of life ? Is there really a God who 's greater than this tragedy ? those questions were asked from such a deep place because I was n't going to make it unless the answers were real . It was n't an intellectual quest at all . Of course , there was a lot of heartache and incredible sadness and anger . Suddenly all of my illusions and assumptions were exposed for what they were . Everything that pretends to be a matter of life and death but is n't revealed itself . As I made my way through the grief , I realized that there are two levels of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other is this movement of the spirit of God trying to help our souls awaken to a power greater than anything that will ever happen to us . Grief was the opening through which I found that power . In many ways it was a great gift to be broken open at so young an age because it gave me the rest of my life to benefit from what I 'd learned . At 27,1 had begun to believe that my roles-wife , motherwere who I was . I did n't have a single anchor that was deeply rooted within me . That also was a great gift of the grief . No matter what else might happen , I 'd found a place inside that is greater than the darkness . Did your image of God change ? I did n't really know what my image of God was until the accident . I thought that people who were basically good and not harming anybody should not themselves be harmed . I used to have an image of a God who would stop a speeding car or bullet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aftermath of my loss , I prayed what I think was the first honest prayer of my life , which was " God if you are really out there and if you are real , then help me , let me find you , show me who you are . " That 's when there was a major shift from a God out there to a God within . What about people who say that in order for God to bless us , sometimes God has to take us through a lot of pain ? I do n't agree with that . I do n't have an image of a God saying , " OK , so let 's discard Roy and Sarah so that Paula can go through this experience and gain something . " But I think in that experience I became teachable because I stopped feeling a sense of my own control . I was powerless . So why is that idea of God causing pain so persistent ? I think humans have a desperate need to have things make sense , to have answers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . Everyone says , " When I die I have these questions for God . " But I realized I had no questions . The only point of life is letting go of our own ego 's needs and desires and coming to know God 's love . A favorite scripture passage of mine is when Jesus is walking along the Sea of Galilee and tells certain men to put down their nets and follow him . It sounds like a very romantic story , but in fact that moment turned their lives completely upside down . Into every life comes opportunities and times when something is saying to you , " Put down your nets and follow me . " Your nets are your conclusions , your images of the way you wanted your life to go . How were you able to make that spiritual shift ? I looked at what strengthened me and what weakened me . I realized every choice has a ripple . IfI wanted to get to a deeper place within , I had to support that with the decisions I made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and which did not . The late spiritual writer Father Henri Nouwen had a great phrase : " Control your own drawbridge . " Pay attention to who is walking in and out of your life . With most people , the drawbridge is down and they allow anybody to come in and out . You have to think about what you 're feeding yourself and your soul . After the accident I had many friends who were in their 80s . People used to laugh at that , but these older friends were already at that point in life where they knew what really matters . They got it . What can people do to help someone in their grief ? The single most important thing that people can do is just to be willing to be with you in your pain and not try to fix it-not give their own conclusions such as , " It was really a blessing ; she 's in heaven now with God . " That hurts if you 're not ready to hear it . Nobody can say to you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come to that yourself , but it has to come from within . I eventually did realize that life is precious , and you should n't waste a minute of it . That drastically changed the way I raised my second child because I realized I do n't own her , she does n't belong to me . She is pure gift , and you absolutely treat a gift and a possession differently . I had an antenna for people who were comfortable with their own pain and those who were n't . Those who were n't wanted to make small talk . I hated it when people would say , " By now you should be taking off your wedding band or packing away their clothes or getting back to work . " That was their need for me to get this fixed because it made them uncomfortable . They did n't want to realize it might happen to them . Once someone said her husband was away for a weekend so now she knew what it felt like to be a widow . Such comments were hurtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk at the ocean . It was a real chance to talk , and I needed people to hear the story . I had to keep telling it because I was still believing it as I was telling it . Then there was the secondary team , the people who could do practical things like grocery shop and babysit . God bless them , because not everybody is wired to be the confidante . Sometimes your best friends are not able to do the grief journey with you . That was really hurtful at first , but years later I understood that people are in our lives for different reasons and have different gifts . Do you think the church 's rituals around death are helpful to people who are grieving ? I think some ritual is necessary . Some other cultures do it better than we do in mainstream America . But the wake , where you have a chance to see the person and say goodbye , is important . So is having people surround you in your grief . I felt lost to myself , but other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Their presence said : The community is still here . But many people who do n't have that kind of community are walking around with so much repressed grief and pain . When I work with prisoners and people in shelters , I see so much unacknowledged grief and pain . Those people do n't even have a chance at their lives until the pain is dislodged . Repressed grief is like a beach ball that you try to hold underwater but that wants to keep popping up to the surface . You 're allocating a certain amount of your energy to keeping that ball under water . You fear that if you allow the pain to become conscious , you 'll start crying and never stop . That speaks to the amount of pain that 's underneath . Catholic author Father Richard Rohr said it well : " Pain that is not transformed will be transmitted . " What about the stages of grief ? I do believe the stages of grief are accurate , but I do n't think they 're that neat . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anger and could move on to acceptance , then all of a sudden I was angry again . It 's disheartening if you do n't undertand grief . It does n't mean the healing work that you did last week does n't count . Only that you 've gotten a little stronger and are now able to feel the force of the pain more . Does grief have to include a crisis of faith ? I have a very close friend in her 40s who had already been on a very strong faith journey when her 22-year-old son was killed by a drunk driver . I was able to watch how somebody with a mature faith experienced the pain and the loss-but not the suffering of having it rip apart all your theories about life and God . I realized that the largest part of my suffering came because all those images were shattered with nothing to replace them . None of my theories were strong enough to hold that kind of pain . This friend was extraordinary in her grief . There was an amazing moment with her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son after he died . She asked me to join her , so I walked in and she was standing over the gurney looking at her son . She said to me , " He never was really mine , was he ? " I said , " None of them are ours . " And she said , " Then it 's not true that God has taken him from me . He was a gift , and I 'm going to give him back . " She asked me to take her son 's hand , she took his other hand , and we formed a circle . Then she looked up and said , " God , this was without question the most treasured gift you have ever given me and I thank you profoundly for that , and in this moment , I give him back to you . " That was real faith . How does grief affect a marriage ? Studies show that 87 percent of marriages do not survive the death of a child . You have two separate people simultaneously going through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has always been your shoulder to cry on is in the same place . I had good friends who tried to navigate it by going to other people for support , but ultimately they divorced because they lost the intimacy of those years . Couples who navigate grief well are able to intermittently be there for one another but do not expect too much from each other . Grief is like a searchlight that illuminates the hidden inner things of your life . If there are weak links in your relationship , it puts tremendous pressure on them . If the weak links are significant , the chain breaks . It takes tremendous courage and maybe luck to escape that . People grieve in such different ways . One woman complained after the death of her two teenage sons in a car accident that her husband was n't grieving because he was n't crying . But he and those sons used to rebuild cars , and after their deaths he was in the garage rebuilding the last car . That was his grief work . Does n't it seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand it , but I think it 's absolutely true . People sometimes get more than they 're able to bear . There is n't a quota system . I did think after Sarah died that surely Roy would n't die . But he did . But then you start to open your eyes and see people all over this world losing multiple people all the time . So then the question becomes , " How am I going to live ? Am I going to live with my heart closed because this happened to me ? " What an awful outcome , refusing to love again . I wanted the direct result of those lives touching mine to be greater love in me . How did you do that ? I think the only way to grow in compassion is to get the cover ripped off . The ego does not surrender easily . As that shell is ripped open , it feels like death , but the only way to understand it is that on a deeper level the divine is trying to break through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how I understand Incarnation . In some ways , other traditions put this in more usable terms , like " awakening . " But in our tradition the mystics are an example of people who " got it . " And Jesus came to embody it , to show what it 's like when the divine breaks through the human . This level of love teaches us which things really matter in life and which do n't . What can parishes do to help those who are grieving ? First , they can recognize that it is difficult for many people to immediately return to their home churches . Sometimes people need a neutral place without memories . I encourage churches and ministers of care to keep a grief calendar and write down the day of the loss . Then flip ahead , say , four or six months and remember to check in . By then the shock has begun to wear off and the full impact of grief is felt . Too many people think you should be OK by then and have stopped calling . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you like to go with me to 8 a.m . Mass ? " The biggest throw-away line is " Call me if you need me . " For people in the shock of grief , the distance to the telephone may as well be across the Sahara . What about people who seem to get over their grief really quickly . What 's the danger in that ? That you have n't done the inner work , or that you 're trying to hold up appearances . Healing ca n't be rushed . Some people say , " Well , we 're Christians , so we just accept this , " as if there were no grief . I do n't trust that . Each person has a unique journey . Each bereaved hearts finds his or her own way . Whenever any community gets rigid and says , " Here are the ways to feel , here are the answers , " I 'm suspicious . Will this always be a part of you ? I was 27 years old when the accident happened , and 27 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Now the loss was behind me . On that day , I was in Houston at a red light and a man ran the light and hit my car . The same day . I could n't believe this could happen to me again . I fell apart . But then a friend said that perhaps you ca n't ever put something like that away . It was part of my deepest pain but also the opening for my most brilliant light , so if I was " done with it , " I would also be done with the brilliance . I dreamed of having lots of children , but I ended up having only one daughter . That 's not what I would have chosen . But my life has taken me deeply into the lives of children I would have never known . I wanted to be married to Roy D'Arcy for the rest of my life . Yet so much love has still come into my life . If I had clung to only one form of love , I would have suffered all my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had an amazing life . People ask me if I could have back the past but had to sacrifice what I know now , would I do it ? I would n't , because the learning has been too great . That life was wonderful , but it was always fragile . Now I see much greater meaning in this life , and I would n't trade that . Sidebar The largest part of my suffering came because all my images were shattered with nothing to replace them . None of my theories were strong enough to hold that pain . // <p>
