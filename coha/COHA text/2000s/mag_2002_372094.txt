The word from Bode Miller 's coach this year is that Miller has finally matured as a ski racer . Found the brake pedal . The guy was always as fast as an avalanche , but just as wild . He would occasionally show up on the winners ' podium , but that seemed purely accidental . The rest of the time Bullet Bode ( it 's pronounced Bo-dee ) would be so far off the course you would need a GPS to find him . This season , though , Miller has been a fixture on the winners ' stand of the World Cup tour , Europe 's glamorous winter circuit . He has won four races outright , something an American has n't done in almost two decades . At Salt Lake City he will be a medal contender in the slalom , giant slalom and combined ( downhill and slalom ) events , " the variety pack , " as he calls it . <P> But maturity ? No way , says Miller , 24 , who proved it a couple of months ago by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't in it . Uh-oh , no one was  --  Miller started the car , in gear , without getting in . Besides , he says , " I 'm skiing really similar to the way I 've been skiing for the past five years . I still crash out of races . " <P> The difference this year is that Miller knows he 's faster than anyone else running slalom gates ; it 's just a question of how fast he needs to be to win . So he has learned how to better manage that tiny margin of error that separates world beaters from snow eaters . " He does n't have to go all out every run , " explains Tommy Moe , who won the downhill in 1994 . " When you get that confident , it 's really easy to ski fast . " <P> Miller is the triple-threat leader of a U.S. ski team that is crucial to the U.S. Olympic Committee 's goal of winning a record 20 medals in these Games . ( The tally from Nagano in 1998 : 13 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumps and jumps  --  wild man Jonny Moseley and the meticulous Eric Bergoust will be defending their respective titles . The mogul team is impressively deep . The women 's bumpers , led by Hannah Hardaway and Shannon Bahrke , could sweep , or be swept , in an amazingly talented field led by Norway 's Kari Traa . Overall , nothing less than a perfect run will win . That means big " airs , " such as helicopters and other spectacular jumps . Moseley is working on one he calls the " dinner roll . " Says moguls head coach Don St. Pierre : " It looks pretty hairy . The fact that he skis away is going to impress the crowd . " <P> In the " technical " events  --  slalom and giant slalom  --  Kristina Koznick , the prodigal child of the women 's team , is returning home in great form . And Picabo Street has once again been surgically reassembled to contest the downhill . One more sensational crash , though , and she will have to be sold for parts . <P> Bergoust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aerial skiing , sees these Games as a huge opportunity for his sport to " transcend skiing . " Says he : " An aerials event in sunny blue sky is the most beautiful thing . " Aerials tickets sold out before the downhill tickets , and competition will take place in front of some 13,000 fans in a festive atmosphere at Deer Valley .
