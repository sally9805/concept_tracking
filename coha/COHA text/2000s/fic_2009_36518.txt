1 <p> As the van turned off Laurel Canyon and up onto Wonderland , Potts said to Squiers , " How many dead bodies have you seen ? " <p> Squiers thought for a minute , his face squinted as if thought were painful to him . Potts figured it probably was . Finally Squiers said , " You mean , like , in a funeral home or just laying around ? " <p> This sort of thing never failed to drive Potts crazy . You ask him a simple question and he takes three fucking days and then gives you a stupid answer . This is why he hated working with him . <p> " Jesus , yeah , okay , just fucking laying around . Not your fucking grannie in her coffin . " <p> This sent Squiers into another round of thought and facial manipulation . I could go out for a freaking cup of coffee while he 's thinking , Potts said to himself . Potts wanted to hit him with something . Instead he bit his lip and turned his head to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the steep , winding street that seemed to go on forever . Squiers drove , as always , because Squiers liked driving and Potts did n't . In Potts 's opinion , you had to be an idiot or a maniac to enjoy driving in Los Angeles . Squiers qualified as both . Potts read somewhere that there were more than ten million people in L.A. , people who spent literally half their lives on the roads . In some places twelve lanes of traffic going eighty miles an hour , bumper to bumper , within inches of one another . Careening along in several tons of glass and metal , your knuckles white on the wheel . You go too slow they run over your ass . You go too fast you ca n't stop in time when some old fart brakes at a senile hallucination , standing a lane of a hundred cars on its nose . You got no choice but to do whatever everybody else is doing , no matter how stupid . Mainly you just do it and try not to think about the mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any of this could function for longer than fifteen seconds without getting you killed or mangled . On the other hand , every fifteen seconds somebody actually was getting killed or mangled on an L.A. freeway , so it was perfectly sane to stress about it . You had to have a fucking death wish to drive in L.A. <p> What Potts hated mainly , though , was that you were forced to pretend people knew what they were doing when they clearly did n't . You look out the window at the faces hurtling past and they give you no reason for hope . Whizzing past goes a collection of drunks , hormonal teenagers , housewives fighting with their kids , hypertense execs screaming into cell phones , the ancient , the half blind , the losers with no reason to keep living , the sleep-deprived but amphetamine-amped truck drivers swinging a gazillion-tonned rig of toilet supplies . Faces out of some <p> goddamned horror movie . One false move and everybody dies . You had to lie to yourself in order to function . This is what got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years in a Texas prison and it changes your view of what people are like . Jesus , so many fucking psychos loose in the world it 's a wonder we manage to wake in our beds alive , much less navigate a fucking superhighway . Then you were forced to shove all this aside , cram it into some little cupboard in your brain and shut it away , whenever you walked out the fucking door in the morning . You had to make yourself forget everything you knew about life , everything you knew to be true , and pretend that people were somehow Good and not the collection of thieves and madmen and basic shits you knew them to be . This is what drove Potts crazy . It was exhausting , this burden of self-deception . The goddamn weight of it made him tired all the time . <p> Potts looked over at Squiers , who stared straight ahead over the wheel , brow creased , mimicking the act of human thought . Squiers was huge , pale , and dumb , Potts 's exact opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , of course , and felt the world would clearly be a much safer place if Squiers happened to get run over by a train . Squiers was slow and plodding and whatever happened in his head bore no resemblance to what happened in Potts 's . Squiers never worried , never got nervous or frightened , could fall asleep standing up like a goddamn Holstein . Never questioned anything , never contributed an answer , never argued . He 'd either do something or he would n't , and you could never be sure which way it would go , since there appeared to be no thought process behind it . Squiers was maybe the happiest person Potts had ever met . There were no conflicts in his life . You give Squiers a nice blood-soaked chainsaw movie or a pile of cheap porno mags and Squiers was as content as a child . Meanwhile Potts had a bad stomach and could n't remember a time when the sky was n't fixing to collapse on him . Potts had to envy him a little , while still hating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made jokes about their each being one half of the perfect employee , though utter fuckups individually . Potts did n't like Richie very much either , though Richie paid well and ex-cons could n't be too choosy . <p> The van climbed up and up , out of this world and into the next , past fancy-ass places costing millions of bucks but still had their asses on stilts hanging a hundred feet over a goddamn canyon . For that kind of money you 'd think you could get a backyard . Potts could n't imagine life without a backyard , you had to have a backyard . Someplace you could go out and drink a beer and barbecue a goddamn hamburger . Even the little shitpile he rented out in Redlands had a fucking backyard . The truth was , though , the whole Hollywood Hills scene was bullshit . For a couple of million bucks you got a dinky house with no yard at all and its ass hanging over a goddamn abyss . Well yeah , that was fucking Hollywood all over , was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars my ass . A bunch of suckers . Give me a house with a backyard anytime . <p> " A hundred and twenty-three , " said Squiers . <p> Potts looked at him . " What ? " <p> " Dead bodies I seen . " <p> " You lying sack of shit . A hundred and twenty-three ? What kind of number is that ? You a fucking guard at Auschwitz or something ? Jesus . " <p> " No , no kidding . I saw a plane crash once . A hundred and fucking twenty-three people perished . " <p> Squiers saying that word , perished , really irritated the hell out of Potts . He was lying , he 'd heard it somewhere on the news , and the newscaster had said perished . Squiers did n't even know what it meant , where the hell would he get off using a word like that . Potts decided to nail him on it . <p> " You saw a plane crash . " <p> " Yeah , that 's right . " <p> " You actually saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't actually see it , like , hit the ground . But I come along right after it did , when all the fire trucks were there and shit . " <p> " And you saw the bodies ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " You saw the bodies , right ? A hundred and twenty-three fucking bodies , thrown all over the ground . And you counted them , right ? One , two , three , a hundred and twenty-three ? " <p> " Well , no , shit , I did n't actually see the bodies , but they were there . A hundred and twenty three-people on that plane and they all perished . " <p> Potts took a deep breath and sighed . " What did I ask you ? " <p> " When ? " <p> " When I asked you how many bodies you 've seen . I said seen . That 's the word I used . I did n't say how many bodies have you heard about , how many the fucking bozo on the news said there were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , man . I did n't have to see them . It was a fucking planeload of people . " <p> " But the point is , you did n't actually see them , did you ? You heard about them , but you did n't actually see them with your own little eyes . Am I correct ? " <p> " Yeah but  --  " <p> " No , no fucking but . Did you actually , personally , with your own eyes , see a hundred and twenty-three bodies ? Just yes or no . Yes or no . " <p> Squiers steamed for a minute , he wriggled his ass a little in the driver 's seat , then he said curtly : " No . " <p> " Aha ! " said Potts . " I rest my case . " <p> The van climbed slowly up the steep winding road . It was three o'clock in the morning and a goddamn fog coming in did n't help matters . They had to stop several times to check the streets . It was like a rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb was endless . He did n't like heights . He liked nice flat ground , that 's why he lived in the desert . <p> " This is it , " Potts said . <p> They stopped at a large metal gate . Squiers edged the van up next to the keypad . Squiers looked at Potts , who was shuffling around the various pockets of the combat gear he liked to wear . <p> " You got the code ? " <p> " Yeah , of course I 've got the code . " Truth was , Richie had written the code on a little Post-it note and given it to him and now Potts could n't find it . He 'd taken it from Richie back at the club and had n't thought about it and now he could n't find the goddamn thing . He fought back a rising panic attack . Squiers , the bastard , was watching him with a barely hidden smirk on his face . He was hoping Potts could n't find it so they 'd have to call Richie and Richie would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airplane thing and was too dumb to figure out how to get revenge on his own . <p> At last Potts found the Post-it note , stuck in one of the chest pockets on his camouflage jacket . He felt his bowels relax and Squiers looked disappointed . Potts tried to look cool , as if it had n't been any sweat , and read the code to Squiers , who reached through the window and punched it in . The gate shuddered a little then opened and they drove through . <p> The house was perched on a knoll right up at the very end of Wonderland Avenue . As the gate shut behind them , they climbed up the narrow drive to a level paved area where the garage was . There was a sharp right and the drive continued up at a steep angle to the house itself . Squiers parked the van in front of the garage . They got out and stared at the steep rise . <p> " Shit , " said Potts . " How are the parking brakes on this fucker ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ai n't my van . " <p> " We have to back it up and park the bastard there , " Potts said , motioning up the drive . " And you better hope the son of a bitch do n't roll downhill and go shooting off into outer space . " <p> " Shit , " said Squiers . He looked at the spot where they 'd have to park , then followed the possible trajectory of the vehicle downhill and off the edge of the knoll and down onto a valley full of houses . <p> " Well , let 's do it , " said Potts . " Let 's go have a look first . " <p> They trudged up the hill . Potts was small and wiry but he smoked . Squiers was a huge fucking buffoon . By the time they got to the top they were both out of breath . They sat for a moment , then Squiers tried the door . It was unlocked . He looked at Potts , waiting . <p> They entered the darkened house , stepping into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sides by floor-to-ceiling walls of glass . Beyond was a patio that wrapped around most of the house and a panorama of the lights of Los Angeles far below . <p> Squiers reached over to flip on a light but Potts stopped him . <p> " What the hell are you doing ? It 's like a goddamn fishbowl in here . They could fucking see us from fucking Compton . " <p> Potts went over and pulled closed the heavy curtains . " Now you can turn on the fucking light . " <p> They looked around the room . <p> " It 's a fucking dump , " declared Potts . " The fucker 's got about a billion fucking dollars and not a lick of taste . Not a goddamn thing worth stealing . " <p> " Richie 'll get pissed if we stole anything , " said Squiers . " He said not to touch anything . " <p> " Fuck Richie , " said Potts . " Anyway there 's nothing to steal . Look at this shit . Jesus . " <p> Potts started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? " <p> " Upstairs , I think . " <p> They trudged up the steps . Potts opened a door . An office . He opened another one . A large messy bedroom . He pushed open another one . <p> The girl sat slumped on the toilet . She looked maybe sixteen or seventeen , very pretty , with long brown hair and a good figure . She was wearing a short , plaid skirt and a pair of colored tights were down around her ankles . A needle and a syringe stuck out of her left thigh , and the works for cooking up heroin sat on the sink next to her . <p> Potts and Squiers stared at her for a while . <p> " She 's cute , " Squiers said after a while . " You sure she 's dead ? " <p> " She fucking better be , " said Potts . <p> " Cute tits . " <p> " You 're a fucking pervert , " said Potts distastefully , " you know that ? " <p> " All I 'm saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " <p> Potts made a disgusted face . " Where 's the fucking camera ? " <p> Squiers dug out a small , cheap 35mm tourist 's camera . <p> " How come he did n't give us a digital ? " asked Squiers , examining the camera . " This is shit . " <p> " Because he wants the fucking film , that 's why . " <p> " Yeah , but why 's it got to be film ? " <p> " Because he does n't fucking trust us , okay ? We could make copies before we got back . He wants the fucking roll of film . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Can I have the fucking camera now , please ? " <p> Potts took pictures of the girl from all angles , pausing only to let the flash recharge . <p> " Okay , go and get the van , " he told Squiers , " and back it up as close as you can . I do n't want to have to drag this bitch all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go and get the van ? " <p> " Mainly because you 're a fucking sick motherfucker and there 's no way in hell I 'm going to leave you alone with this bitch . Does that answer your fucking question ? " <p> Squiers looked at him . He did n't move . For a moment Potts thought he was going to turn on him . But you could never tell what Squiers was thinking , if what he did could be called thinking . There was always just that sort of glassy look , as if he 'd managed to focus through your eyes and onto the back of your head . Potts waited for a move , the flicker of a muscle before he struck , because you 'd never see it in his eyes first . Squiers might be a fucking moron but you could n't read him and you could n't assume he 'd even do what was in his own interest . <p> Finally Squiers just shrugged and turned and went downstairs . Potts took a deep breath and went into the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " establishing shots , " photos that clearly identified the place . Richie thought of everything . Potts did n't like the miserable goombah shit any more than he liked Squiers , but you had to hand it to him , he did n't miss a trick . <p> Squiers meanwhile was having a hell of a time getting the van backed up the hill . He 'd borrowed the van from his brother-in-law , who 'd told him it was reliable . Squiers imagined the weasely little son of a bitch laughing at him and made up his mind to beat the shit out of him when he got back , sister or no sister . The gears were shit , first was n't enough and second was too much . After a lot of grinding and rocking , Squiers finally just pulled all the way up to the garage , then backed up quick enough that the bumper scraped the pavement before it rose up the hill . When he got to the top , Squiers left the van in first and locked the emergency brake . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited and the thing did n't go anywhere , so he got out of the van and went back into the house . <p> " You think you made enough fucking noise ? " Potts said to him when he walked in the door . <p> " I think we ought to hurry . I do n't trust the brakes on that thing . " <p> " Shit . " <p> Potts went into the upstairs bedroom and pulled a duvet off the bed . He dragged it into the hallway outside the bathroom and spread it on the floor . Squiers started into the bathroom to pick the girl up but Potts pushed him aside . Squiers stood back and let Potts tend to her . Potts pulled out the syringe and laid it on the sink next to the works . He lifted her off the toilet and dragged her into the hallway and onto the blanket . The dress had ridden up and she was naked underneath . Potts wrestled the panty hose back up over her hips . <p> " Why bother to do that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I do n't want anybody thinking we interfered with her . " <p> " What difference does it make ? " <p> Potts did n't bother with a reply . It made Potts sick to think of somebody finding the body and believing it had been interfered with . It was just the sort of filthy thing that the newspapers and TV loved , and it made Potts sick to imagine that somebody might think it was him , even if they had no idea who he actually was . When he 'd made the girl decent he rolled her up in the blanket , like a Tootsie Roll . <p> " What about the works ? " Squiers asked him . <p> " Richie said leave it , it 'll give this fucker something to remind him when he comes home . " <p> They held opposite ends of the rolled blanket and awkwardly carried the body down the stairs , out of the house , and to the van . Squiers reached with one hand to open the back door of the van when the vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panicked , Squiers let go his end of the blanket . The end with the girl 's head struck the ground with a dull thud . Squiers was dancing alongside the van , struggling with the door , as it began rolling downhill . The van was picking up speed as Squiers jumped inside . He pushed the brake and nothing much happened . The garage was looming up fast . Squiers stood up on the goddamn brake , trying to push it through the floor , pushing his back against the seat and pulling hard at the wheel with his hands . There was an ugly grinding noise and Squiers thought the brakes had given way completely but the van slowed with a sound like a freight train stopping and came to rest a couple of feet from the bumper of the Porsche sitting in the garage . <p> Squiers slumped over the steering wheel . He got out and looked up the hill at Potts , who had sat down next to the girl , his mouth open . <p> Squiers came trudging up the hill . " Fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd just stepped off some ride at Magic Mountain . <p> There was nothing Potts could possibly say . They half carried , half dragged the girl down the hill and stuck her into the van . They were nearly to Ontario and Potts was still shaking inside and smoking another cigarette to calm himself down when Squiers said , out of the blue : <p> " At least her ass was clean .
