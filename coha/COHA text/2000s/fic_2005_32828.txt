From Hazing Meri Sugarman April 15 Dear Diary : I had a nightmare last night . It was after midnight in Marietta , Ohio , my hometown , and it felt like I was much younger than I really am  --  maybe twelve or thirteen . Walking through the town square , I noticed there was a long line of women waiting to get inside The Big Bang , a local male strip joint ( you know , the type of place where women go for birthday celebrations or bachelorette parties and things ) , and I really wanted to go in , but not for any dirty reason . I mean , I 've never had a boyfriend before , even though I 'm close to graduating high school , and yet I felt strangely compelled to go inside . So I snuck in . I scurried through the back alley , found an open window , pushed myself through , and landed with a painful thud on the ladies ' room floor . It was strange . None of the women there seemed to notice me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head low , and when I stepped into the club , I was assaulted with loud music and a crush of jostling women ( and a lot of really handsome cocktail waiters , too ) and still no one noticed me . What was I doing here ? All the women were beautiful . All the men were beautiful . And me ? Okay , I 'll be honest . I 'm fully aware of the mirror and its cruel reflection of my pudgy face , my bulbous nose , and my upper lip , for which there is only one word : wax . In elementary school I was cast as Nana , the dog in Peter Pan . And Miss Tucci , the drama teacher , did n't think I needed all that much makeup when she cast me as the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz . Hardy har . I know , poor me . Play the tiny violin . I try not to get down about things like that . I try to be optimistic . I try to believe in the goodness of virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . It does n't make the teasing any easier , or make me feel less ugly , or any less of a loser , but it gets me through the day . But back to my dream . Suddenly the music seemed louder , much louder , the lights brighter , and ponying onto the stage was a stripper in a modified cowboy outfit with a ten-gallon hat that cast a long shadow over his face . Well , I may not be the prettiest girl around , but I have a pulse . This guy was really cute . He started dancing and gyrating and taking off practically all of his clothes , until he was wearing nothing but a jock strap , cowboy boots , and that big ten-gallon hat . By this time I was getting nervous , not because of the guy dancing , but because everyone in the club started melting away , literally , till there was no one left but me and the stripper . Then the music stopped cold . The stripper lit a big , fat cigar , pointed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My jaw dropped . I could n't believe it . The stripper was my dad ! Then I woke up and there was Dad coming right at me , along with Mom and my sister , Lisa , all of them singing " Happy Birthday . " I gasped and yanked the covers up , and tumbling to the floor was my dog-eared copy of Come Slowly , My Darling , with a really handsome matador embracing a peasant girl on the cover . " Eeeow , " chuckled Lisa . " Cindy 's reading dirty books again . " Mom shushed her , but you could tell she was holding back a laugh too . See , Lisa may be three years younger than me , but she 's very pretty ( just like Mom ) . I 'll be blunt about Mom . I 'm a disappointment to her . I was her firstborn  --  and look how I turned out . In a way , I 'm glad Lisa 's around . The less attention I get , the better . My dad 's another story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me shopping for my sixteenth birthday in Parkersburg , West Virginia ( that 's the closest big town nearby ) , and bought me a genuine gold necklace . It sparkles . And , yes , he 's handsome , I admit it . He treats me like a real person , too . Not that he should n't  --  he is my dad , after all  --  but in my life , that 's kind of a novelty . He also gave me the sweetest gift for my birthday this year : this diary . " For all your happy thoughts , " he said , and I could see Lisa making a gagging motion behind him . I 'm not sure how many happy thoughts I have , but I do have a potentially good academic future . I was recently accepted to Rumson River University in North Carolina , just like Dad . That 's where Mom and Dad met , in fact . He was the star quarterback , she was head cheerleader . I know , I know , but it 's true . Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a high kick on the football field . It hangs right above her scale in the bathroom . Even I have to admit she looks pretty similar ; she has n't changed at all . Lisa 's a cheerleader too , but I kind of doubt she 'll get into Rumson U. Her grades suck . But enough about Lisa and my mom . This diary is supposed to be about me . Only I do n't know what to say . I 'm sitting up in my bed right now writing this  --  my seventeenth birthday is coming to an end . I should be happy , but I 'm not . Sometimes I ca n't stand myself or anything around me , including my bedroom . A few months ago Lisa and Mom discovered decoupage . They decoupaged all my walls : pink pussycats and rainbows . Yuck . They even decoupaged my phone . Maybe I 'll have a nice dream tonight . I wish you could will yourself to dream about nice things . Maybe I 'll dream about Rumson U. I have a feeling things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher learning , after all , and I 'm majoring in literature . People will be serious there , and I 'll meet all kinds of like-minded friends  --  people who are happy to learn and who do n't care about what I look like . Maybe I 'll even have a boyfriend . Okay , that 's probably stretching it , or tempting the gods , or something like that . I 'm such a loser . I think I 'd like to dream about nothing tonight . Absolutely nothing . That sounds safe . April 16 Dear Diary : I do n't think I can do this diary thing anymore . Why should I ? What am I supposed to write about ? All the terrible things that happen to me every day ? Take today , for example . Bud Finger , this really immature , jerky guy , snuck up behind me at my locker after third period and whispered , " Bud Finger , at your cervix . " I pushed him away and he laughed  --  with that sputtering , snot-filled laugh he has . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he darted down the hall . Well , that was n't so bad , I guess , but I had no idea he had stuck a piece of paper on my back that said in big , black Sharpie letters : IF YOU WANT MY ATTENTION , MOO . It took me almost two whole periods to realize why everyone was going , " M-o-o-o-o-o-o , " when they saw me . My chemistry teacher , Mrs. Felton , was the one who told me about it . It did n't help that she was stifling a laugh . At the end of the day I went to my locker , minding my own business ( I swear ) , and I heard soft moaning . I looked over , and two lockers down Julie Murmelstone was making out with Jeff Leigh . " Jeff . God . You 're standing at attention , " she cooed . He grinned . " You know what they say . To fully inflate , blow into the tube . " She coyly squealed and blew a little puff of air at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was gaping . I could n't move . I was frozen to the spot . " Aw , lookit . It 's little Cindy Bixby . You like to watch ? Is that it ? Is that what gets you off ? Little Miss Priss likes to watch ? " They laughed at me . I do n't care what anyone says to me  --  really , no matter how awful or nasty it is . But being laughed at hurts . Is that what this diary is going to be ? A list of how people make fun of me every day ? No , thank you , ma'am . I do n't need to look back at this thing years later and relive all the misery . Living it 's enough . I 'm a good person and I want a good future for myself . If I remain positive , positive things will happen , and people like Bud Finger and Julie Murmelstone wo n't bug me anymore . I mean , maybe they will , but it wo n't faze me . I saw Carrie on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that girl . I do n't want to hurt anyone . Maybe the trick is to stop thinking about it . And stop writing about it too . I 'm sorry , Diary , but I think it 's time to put you away . For good . My life is depressing enough . August 14 Dear Diary : I 'm so glad I found you ! My room is a complete wreck . I 'm packing up for college . There you were under my bed next to my rumpled culottes and my old recorder from third grade . So much has changed . So many good things . I glanced over what I wrote before , and boy , I sure was " down in the dumpity-doo " ( Mom always uses that phrase ) ( in reference to me ) ( of course ) . But things turned around as my senior year drew to a close . Good-bye , Chesterfield High . And guess what ? I even went to the prom . Okay , so I went with Bud Finger , but do n't draw quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked practically every girl in school , even a couple of the mentally challenged girls from the Special Education program . " Some of them bitches are tasty , " he said , but I guess even mentally challenged girls know better . Anyway , I was riding the bus home one day and he hit me in the back of the head with a paperback copy of Forced Heretic 2 : Star Wars , The New Jedi Order , Book 16 . ( Now you know who reads that junk . ) He said it was an accident , and he did n't laugh , so I knew he wanted something . Then he just flat out asked me : " Wan na go to the prom ? " It took me a moment , but actually not that long . In what seemed like half a second , I went over all the pros and cons . On the pro side , I had n't even thought of going to the prom ( I did n't even think it was a possibility ) , so the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing with all my other classmates was pretty tempting . On the con side , there was the issue of Bud . I said , " Yes . " He grinned stupidly . " Uh-huh . I figured you 'd say that . " Why did I say yes ? Well , because even if I 'd be going with Bud , I 'd still be going . And now I wo n't be some bitter old lady in a rocking chair in my eighties too embarrassed to tell my grandchildren that I never went to my prom . That 's too sad . I 'm trying so hard not to be sad these days . Usually , I look at every new situation in my life as if disaster is inevitable . It makes me very tense . I guess I lack the confidence of someone like Lisa , for instance . In fact , I do n't have any confidence at all . But I 'm trying a new trick these days : I 'm pretending that I do . The prom was fun . Bud forgot to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a plan . Once we arrived at the school gym , I ditched him . Completely . I spent time with a few girls when they were n't dancing with their boyfriends , and I had a nice chat about my future with Mr. Sherman , my Honors English teacher . Bud kept asking me to dance , and I kept saying no . This was going to be my prom on my terms , and those terms did not include dancing and being groped by Bud . I did dance , though , once . Mr. Sherman very nicely took me to the dance floor when the band played a slightly off-key rendition of " Top of the World " by the Dixie Chicks . In my head , I was mentally crossing items off a list : I went to the prom , I talked with friends , I danced . These are all good things . And even though Bud tried to stick his tongue down my throat when he dropped me off ( I bit it really hard ) , I felt triumphant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cindy Bixby , would have gone to her high school prom ? Things only got better once I graduated . Dad paid for LASIK surgery for my eyes . Wow ! I ca n't tell you how nice it is not to wear glasses ( my eyes could n't take contacts ) . I feel so much happier . Even prettier . " You 're plain now , " observed Lisa . " That 's better than before . " Even Mom is treating me nicer , though Lisa thinks it 's because I 'm leaving , which means she 'll have one less " thing " to worry about . But I do n't think that 's it . Mom made jasmine tea for me the other night and told me all about her days at Rumson U. And get this : Mom was a sorority girl . She was even president of her sorority , Alpha Beta Delta . " If you want to be popular and meet nice boys , it 's important to join a good sorority . " " Then I 'll join one ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause after I said that , and Mom cupped her mug and stared down at it and seemed to smile a bit . " Do n't you think I should ? " I asked . " My tea is cold , " she intoned , then she stepped away to freshen her cup . If I join a sorority and I become popular , then who knows , maybe I 'll meet a handsome football player just like Mom did . I have to laugh . If I 'd written down things like this a few months ago ( or even thought about them ) , I 'd probably have started to feel sad and imagine all the terrible things that would happen to me if I even tried . But not anymore . This " pretending " thing is working out well . I 'm still scared , I still feel ugly ( not scary-ugly , but plain , I guess , like Lisa says ) , and to tell you the truth , I do n't know why my attitude has changed . Maybe it 's because high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm leaving Marietta . I 'm also looking forward to all the hard work at Rumson U. And , yes , I 'm looking forward to dating . I think I 'm a late bloomer . I think that fits me . Everything good and happy and wonderful that 's going to happen to me will happen in college . How 's that sound , Diary ? See ? I can be positive . And if that 's stretching it , or tempting the gods , so be it . Cindy Bixby 's raring to go ! Continues ...
