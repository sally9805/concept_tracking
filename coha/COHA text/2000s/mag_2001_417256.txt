Sanxingdui Museum . // Surrounded by a barrier of high mountains and plateaus , the Sichuan Basin of southwestern China was long considered a cultural backwater that developed only after travel to and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more exciting and confounding when , in 1986 , brickyard workers digging for clay in Sanxingdui , in western Sichuan , discovered several ancient jade objects . Archaeologists working nearby rushed to the scene and eventually exposed a rectangular pit thirteen feet long containing more than four hundred artifacts dating to the end of the thirteenth century B.C. They included elephant tusks , bronze heads and masks , large rings , rools , stone and jade objects , pottery vessels , and a few gold objects . A second pit , a few decades later in date , was excavated thirty yards away a month later . It yielded a cache of 1,300 objects far richer than those in the first pit . In the years since these remarkable discoveries , cultural historians have struggled to make sense of the objects unearthed in Sanxingdui . The techniques for producing the enormous bronze objects and the ritualistic way in which they were broken and burned before burial indicate a highly developed Bronze Age civilization previously unknown and unrecorded in texts . The realization that in 1200 B.C. artisans in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dictated a version of Chinese history.1 Historians have long been aware that intricately cast bronzes were created in central China as early as the sixteenth century B.C. Robert W. Bagley , a professor of art and archaeology at Princeton University , has written : Partly due to the huge quantity of bronze objects previously excavated in the central plains region near the Yellow and Wei Rivers , historians have always considered that area to be the cradle of China 's venerable civilization , with farflung regions only flourishing under the Shang dynasty ( c. 1500-1050 B.C. ) centered there . Sichuan was thought to be a late bloomer , primarily because of its forbidding geography In fact , in the eighth century A.D. the famous Tang dynasty poet Li Bo ( also known as Li Bai and Li Po ; 701  --  762 ) wrote of the region ( referred to as Shu ) : Terrifying road , inaccessible mountain peaks lie ahead , /Where one sees only dismal birds howling in ancient woods .... /The road to Shu is hard , harder than climbing to the heavens.3 Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures dating to Neolithic times , some five thousand years ago . According to a popular Chinese saying , the Chengdu Plain is " the land of heaven , " a phrase that describes both the regions fertility and its inaccessibility within its ring of mountains . A network of rivers laces the rich alluvial land , including the Yangzi River , which was the most likely early trade route to the world beyond Sichuan . Gold found in the Sanxingdui pits indicates access to a gold-bearing region very likely to the south . Recently unearthed ritual vessels demonstrate the influence of other areas . Yet even though travel to and from Sichuan certainly took place in or before the thirteenth century B.C. , the region developed in relative isolation , as is documented by the Bronze Age works found in the Sanxingdui pits , which have a distinctive sculptural style not seen elsewhere in China during the period . The artifacts in the two pits that brickyard workers discovered in Sanxingdui contain evidence of rituals vastly different from those practiced elsewhere in China at the time . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bronze artifacts clearly show that they were burned and broken before being placed , or thrown into the pits . The curator and organizer of the exhibition noted at the end of this article , Jay Xu , suggests that burning and breaking these man-made objects prior to burial served to " kill " them to facilitate their passage from this world to a supernatural realm . While Shang dynasty kings in central China specified sets of elaborate bronze vessels for their rituals to the ancestors and sacrificed animals and humans as part of the burial practices , human bones have not been found in the Sanxingdui pits , indicating that tombs or burial sites have yet to be located for the Sanxingdui civilization . Photograph To a far greater extent than in other ancient civilizations , the metal industry in China is a revealing index of cultural development ... In fact , large-scale metallurgy supplies a workable criterion for identifying the earliest civilized societies in China.2 Photograph Facing page : Pl . V.

Several of the heads are embellished with gold masks . No other sculptural replicas of humans from this period have been found in China . While the bronze heads have a dull green-blue patina now , they were shiny when they were created , making the gold attachments almost redundant at first . This suggests that the heads were used ceremonially from the beginning and were brightened up with gold when the bronze had dulled . The scholars in China and Seattle who recently inspected the heads noted that the method of applying the gold was quite advanced : a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer of lacquer-based adhesive . All the masks found in the pits are basically U-shaped shells of bronze , with no tops , bottoms , or backs . The most weirdly supernatural is the mask with protruding pupils and enormous ears shown in Plate III.4 The raised pointed ears may mean that this creatures hearing is as sharp as its sight . The mask has a beak-like nose and seems to be smiling , unlike most of the other heads and masks . An opening in the forehead may have held an ornamental appendage like others found in the pits.5 The heads and masks found in the pits , lifelike or not , share distinctive shapes and blocky forms , such as disproportionately large ears with perforated earlobes that were probably ornamented ; stylized facial features , including massive eyebrows above bulging eyes ; straight noses with curled nostrils ; and severe mouths that are no more than a series of horizontal grooves , which were originally tinted red . There is speculation the heads were once attached to wooden " bodies " clothed in real silk , since many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XI ) . One of the most astonishing bronzes found in the Sanxingdui pits is a larger than life-sized statue of a lean , carefully adorned , six-foot-tall man ( Pl . IV ) . His hands are over-sized and probably held an object that he offered in sacrifice , perhaps an elephant tusk , since sixtyseven tusks were found in the pit with him . His head has the same blocky shape and sharp features as the other heads in the pits . The figure is sumptuously dressed , yet his feet are conspicuously bare . He could be a god , but with his arms in an offering pose , he is more likely to be a man of high status making an offering to a god . This is the only full-sized human figure found in the pits , and indeed the only lifesized Chinese statue known before Emperor Qin Shihuangdi 's ( r. 221-210 B.C. ) famous terracotta army a thousand years later Unlike the terracotta soldiers protecting the emperor 's tumulus , the identity and purpose of the standing figure is still a mystery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less remarkable , are the blades with forked ends found in the pits ( see Pl . VIII ) . Hewn from jade , nephrite , marble , and hardstone , the oddly shaped blades lack an obvious prototype in any functional tool or weapon . Clues to their use came from the incised decoration of figures on one of the stone blades and a tiny bronze figure , which reveal that the forked blade was a ceremonial implement held with the forked end pointing upward . Although forked blades with elaborately notched edges at the junction of the blade and the handle have possible Neolithic origins in the Shaanxi region north of Sichuan early in the second millennium B.C. , new evidence from Sanxingdui suggests a surprisingly different possibility It seems that forked blades might have first originated in Sanxingdui and were exported eastward to the central heartland . Furthermore , there is clear evidence that these blades were sent abroad to what are now Hong Kong , North Vietnam , and the Malay Peninsula.6 The bronze vessels found at Sanxing dui have counterparts elsewhere in China . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be excavated , for instance , were imported to Sanxingdui from the middle Yangzi region ( today southern Hubei and northern Hunan provinces ) where they were made . They represent only two of more than twenty vessel types originating in the heartland of the Shang dynasty where they held ceremonial offers of food and wine . At Sanxingdui , however , they held jades , cowrie shells , ivory beads , and tiny bronzes-most valued possessions that were buried with the Shang elite . Altogether twenty-five vessels were found in the pits , further indicating contact between Sichuan and other regions via the Yangzi River . In other words , the Sanxingdui lei and zun versions imitate Shang amphorashaped vessels . Their decoration ranges from simple to flamboyant , and some have ornate appendages in animal shapes rising in all directions from the surface . Another feature unique to these Sichuan vessels are the small holes drilled in the foot rims , sometimes through the cast decoration . This modification from the intended use indicates adaptation to a local purpose that is also very different from their original use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade , twelth century B.c .

For example , there is no evidence to suggest that the rituals of burning and breaking objects and sacrificing bronze heads continued after 1100 B.c . Scholars speculate that some catastrophic event caused Sanxingdui to be abandoned at about that time for the already flourishing city of Chingdu to the south . Even so , recently excavated works from the Eastern Zhou ( 770-221 B.C. ) and Han ( 206 B.C.-D. 220 ) dynasties have a clearly Sichuan feel to them . Many bronze works dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sanxingdui in large ceramic jars . They may have been placed there for safekeeping in a time of unrest , or their interment could have been part of a religious rite . Since they are not burned or broken , it is conceivable that they were hidden by people planning to dig them up later . Excavations some twenty kilometers south of Sanxingdui have unearthed a number of decorated bronze blades that are evidence of centuries of war that characterize the Zhou period from about 770 to 475 B.C. A particularly intriguing object is a ten-inch-long bronze blade , which was part of a ge , an ax with a dagger-shaped blade mounted perpendicular to the shaft ( PI . VI ) . This ge , dating to the Eastern Zhou period , has the same shape as many blades of that era in use throughout China . However , it is the tiger and the accompanying emblems on the blade that make it a classic example of a purely Sichuan weapon . No doubt the decoration , with the tigers gaping jaws and prominent fangs , was meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the blade is written in a script that survives on just a few weapons found only in Sichuan . To some scholars , it looks like Chinese characters , while others think it looks more like alphabetical writing . So far no one has deciphered the inscription-or even in which direction to read it . The exhibition noted at end of this article also includes artifacts dating to the Han dynasty long after Sichuan was invaded in 316 B.C. by the Qin and finally included in the vast Han empire . Despite sinification , the Chengdu Plain was a thriving center of cultural innovation during the Eastern Han dynasty ( 25-220 ) . The tomb furnishings and funerary practices reflect a fusion of previous traditions with newer beliefs in immortality After all , it is claimed that Taoism began in the mountains of Sichuan . Far fewer bronze ritual vessels are found in elite tombs . Instead of evidence of human and animal sacrifice there were amazingly dynamic images of deities and daily life , including figures of servants and models of great houses . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to third century A.D. , shows three entertainers caught in midperformance . At the left , a slender female acrobat stands on her hands on a tower of twelve wooden tables . In the center a female dancer with fluttering scarves plays a pair of drums by leaping from one to the other . On the right a male juggler is intent on keeping three balls in the air . Entertainment , called " the hundred amusements " in Han times , may well have been a feature not only of banquets but also of ceremonial occasions , perhaps even funerals . The most elaborate forms were of course found at court . The founding Qin emperor and the emperor Han Wudi ( r. 141  --  87 B.C. ) are said to have employed entertainers by the thousands . Money trees were a Sichuan specialty ; many were found in tombs in central Sichuan dating to the Eastern Han dynasty . The dramatic bronze and ceramic example shown in Plate X stands about six feet , six inches high . A winged cat crouches on the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bronze tree . The branches are decorated with coins , disks , birds , and miraculous creatures . Clearly one reason these trees were so popular is that they promised unending prosperity and wealth . A twelve-foot-high bronze tree and fragments of others from a time fourteen hundred years before the example in Plate X were found in the second pit excavated at Sanxingdui , giving us pause to consider whether or not the Han elite were aware of the pre-dynastic civilization at Sanxingdui . A traveling exhibition entitled Treasures from a Lost Civilization : Ancient Chinese Art from Sichuan is on view at the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth , Texas , from September 30 until January 13 , 2002 . Future showings will be listed in Calendar It was organized by the Seattle Art Museum in collaboration with the Bureau of Cultural Affairs , Sichuan province of the People 's Republic of China . The exhibition includes many of the objects discovered at Sanxingdui in 1986 as well as other finds in the Sichuan region . The accompanying catalogue is edited by Robert W. Bagley .

As recently as July 1998 , a group of twenty-eight small graves was found , yielding a number of stone and jade artifacts . The plan of the city at Sanxingdui has been mapped out Approximately 22 square miles in area , it was comparable in size to the largest city from this era ever discovered in China . The layout was relatively complex and the city was divided into quarters by walls . More than fifty building foundations have been found , as well as five more pits containing stone and jade . However , nothing rivals the discoveries of 1986 . Footnote 2 Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M Sackler Collections ( Arthur M. Sackler Foundation , Washington , D.C. , and the Arthur M.
