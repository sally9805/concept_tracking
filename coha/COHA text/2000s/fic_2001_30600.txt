It was hotter than hell inside the confessional . A thick black curtain , dusty with age and neglect , covered the narrow opening from the ceiling of the box to the scarred hardwood floor , blocking out both the daylight and the air . It was like being inside a coffin someone had absentmindedly left propped up against the wall , and Father Thomas Madden thanked God he was n't claustrophobic . He was rapidly becoming miserable though . The air was heavy and ripe with mildew , making his breathing as labored as when he was back at Penn State running that last yard to the goalposts with the football tucked neatly in his arm . He had n't minded the pain in his lungs then , and he certainly did n't mind it now . It was all simply part of the job . The old priests would tell him to offer his discomfort up to God for the poor souls in purgatory . Tom did n't see any harm in doing that , even though he wondered how his own misery was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard oak chair , fidgeting like a choirboy at Sunday practice . He could feel the sweat dripping down the sides of his face and neck into his cassock . The long black robe was soaked through with perspiration , and he sincerely doubted he smelled at all like the hint of Irish Spring soap he 'd used in the shower this morning . The temperature outside hovered between ninety-four and ninety-five in the shade of the rectory porch where the thermostat was nailed to the whitewashed stone wall . The humidity made the heat so oppressive , those unfortunate souls who were forced to leave their air-conditioned homes and venture outside did so with a slow shuffle and a quick temper . It was a lousy day for the compressor to bite the dust . There were windows in the church , of course , but the ones that could have been opened had been sealed shut long ago in a futile attempt to keep vandals out . The two others were high up in the gold , domed ceiling . They were stained glass depictions of the archangels Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking up toward heaven , a beatified expression on his face , while Michael scowled at the snakes he held pinned down at his bare feet . The colored windows were considered priceless , prayer-inspiring works of art by the congregation , but they were useless in combating the heat . They had been added for decoration , not ventilation . Tom was a big , strapping man with a **25;784;TOOLONG neck left over from his glory days , but he was cursed with baby sensitive skin . The heat was giving him a prickly rash . He hiked the cassock up to his thighs , revealing the yellow and black happy-face boxer shorts his sister , Laurant , had given him , kicked off his paint-splattered Wal-Mart rubber thongs , and popped a piece of Dubble Bubble into his mouth . An act of kindness had landed him in the sweatbox . While waiting for the test results that would determine if he needed another round of chemotherapy at Kansas University Medical Center , he was a guest of Monsignor McKindry , pastor of Our Lady of Mercy Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City , several hundred miles south of Holy Oaks , Iowa , where Tom was stationed . The neighborhood had been officially designated by a former mayor 's task force as the gang zone . Monsignor always took Saturday afternoon confession , but because of the blistering heat , his advanced age , the broken air conditioner , and a conflict in his schedule the pastor was busy preparing for his reunion with two friends from his seminary days at Assumption Abbey Tom had volunteered for the duty . He had assumed he 'd sit face-to-face with his penitent in a room with a couple of windows open for fresh air . McKindry , however , bowed to the preferences of his faithful parishioners , who stubbornly clung to the old-fashioned way of hearing confessions , a fact Tom learned only after he 'd offered his services , and Lewis , the parish handyman , had directed him to the oven he would sit in for the next ninety minutes . In appreciation Monsignor had loaned him a thoroughly inadequate , battery-operated fan that one of his flock had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the size of a man 's hand . Tom adjusted the angle of the fan so that the air would blow directly on his face , leaned back against the wall , and began to read the Holy Oaks Gazette he 'd brought along to Kansas City with him . He turned to the society page on the back first , because he got such a kick out of it . He glanced over the usual club news and the smattering of announcements two births , three engagements , and a wedding and then he found his favorite column , called " About Town . " The headline was always the same : the bingo game . The number of people who attended the community center bingo night was reported along with the names of the winners of the twenty-five-dollar jackpots . Interviews with the lucky recipients followed , telling what each of them planned to do with his or her windfall . And there was always a comment from Rabbi David Spears , who organized the weekly event , about what a good time everyone had . Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a crush on Rabbi Dave , a widower , and that was why the bingo game was so prominently featured in the paper . The rabbi said the same thing every week , and Tom invariably ribbed him about that when they played golf together on Wednesday afternoons . Since Dave usually beat the socks off him , he did n't mind the teasing , but he did accuse Tom of trying to divert attention from his appalling game . The rest of the column was dedicated to letting everyone in town know who was entertaining company and what they were feeding them . If the news that week was hard to come by , Lorna filled in the space with popular recipes . There were n't any secrets in Holy Oaks . The front page was full of news about the proposed town square development and the upcoming one-hundred-year celebration at Assumption Abbey . And there was a nice mention about his sister helping out at the abbey . The reporter called her a tireless and cheerful volunteer and went into some detail describing all the projects she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the clutter in the attic for a garage sale , but she was also going to transfer all the information from the old dusty files onto the newly donated computer , and when she had a few minutes to spare , she would be translating the French journals of Father Henri VanKirk , a priest who had died recently . Tom chuckled to himself as he finished reading the glowing testimonial to his sister . Laurant had n't actually volunteered for any of the jobs . She just happened to be walking past the abbot at the moment he came up with the ideas , and gracious to a fault , she had n't refused . By the time Tom finished reading the rest of the Gazette , his soaked collar was sticking to his neck . He put the paper on the seat next to him , mopped his brow again , and contemplated closing shop fifteen minutes early . He gave up the idea almost as soon as it entered his mind . He knew that if he left the confessional early , he 'd catch hell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd put in , he simply was n't up to a lecture . On the first Wednesday of every third month Ash Wednesday he silently called it Tom moved in with Monsignor McKindry , an old , broken-nosed , crackled-skinned Irishman who never missed an opportunity to get as much physical labor as he could possibly squeeze out of his houseguest in seven days . McKindry was crusty and gruff , but he had a heart of gold and a compassionate nature that was n't compromised by sentimentality . He firmly believed that idle hands were the devil 's workshop , especially when the rectory was in dire need of a fresh coat of paint . Hard work , he pontificated , would cure anything , even cancer . Some days Tom had a hard time remembering why he liked the monsignor so much or felt a kinship with him . Maybe it was because they both had a bit of Irish in them . Or maybe it was because the old man 's philosophy , that only a fool cried over spilled milk , had sustained him through more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play compared to McKindry 's life . He would do whatever he could to help lighten McKindry 's burdens . Monsignor was looking forward to visiting with his old friends again . One of them was Abbot James Rockhill , Tom 's superior at Assumption Abbey , and the other , Vincent Moreno , was a priest Tom had never met . Neither Rockhill nor Moreno would be staying at Mercy house with McKindry and Tom , for they much preferred the luxuries provided by the staff at Holy Trinity parish , luxuries like hot water that lasted longer than five minutes and central air-conditioning . Trinity was located in the heart of a bedroom community on the other side of the state line separating Missouri from Kansas . McKindry jokingly referred to it as " Our Lady of the Lexus , " and from the number of designer cars parked in the church 's lot on Sunday mornings , the label was right on the mark . Most of the parishioners at Mercy did n't own cars . They walked to church . Tom 's stomach began to rumble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another shower , and he wanted a cold Bud Light . There had n't been a single taker in all the while he 'd been sitting there roasting like a turkey . He did n't think anyone else was even inside the church now , except maybe Lewis , who liked to hide in the cloakroom behind the vestibule and sneak sips of rot whiskey from the bottle in his toolbox . Tom checked his watch , saw he only had a couple of minutes left , and decided he 'd had enough . He switched off the light above the confessional and was reaching for the curtain when he heard the swoosh of air the leather kneeler expelled when weight was placed upon it . The sound was followed by a discreet cough from the confessor 's cell next to him . Tom immediately straightened in his chair , took the gum out of his mouth and put it back in the wrapper , then bowed his head in prayer and slid the wooden panel up . " In the name of the Father and of the Son ... , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign of the cross . Several seconds passed in silence . The penitent was either gathering his thoughts or his courage before he confessed his transgressions . Tom adjusted the stole around his neck and patiently continued to wait . The scent of Calvin Klein 's Obsession came floating through the grille that separated them . It was a distinct , heavy , sweet fragrance Tom recognized because his housekeeper in Rome had given him a bottle of the cologne on his last birthday . A little of the stuff went a long way , and the penitent had gone overboard . The confessional reeked . The scent , combined with the smell of mildew and sweat , made Tom feel as though he were trying to breathe through a plastic bag . His stomach lurched and he forced himself not to gag . " Are you there , Father ? " " I 'm here , " Tom whispered . " When you 're ready to confess your sins , you may begin . " " This is ... difficult for me . My last confession was a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you absolve me now ? " There was an odd , singsong quality to the voice and a mocking tone that put Tom on his guard . Was the stranger simply nervous because it had been such a long time since his last confession , or was he being deliberately irreverent ? " You were n't given absolution ? " " No , I was n't , Father . I angered the priest . I 'll make you angry too . What I have to confess will ... shock you . Then you 'll become angry like the other priest . " " Nothing you say will shock or anger me , " Tom assured him . " You 've heard it all before ? Is that it , Father ? " Before Tom could answer , the penitent whispered , " Hate the sin , not the sinner . " The mocking had intensified . Tom stiffened . " Would you like to begin ? " " Yes , " the stranger replied . " Bless me , Father , for I will sin . " Confused by what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the man to start over . " Bless me , Father , for I will sin . " " You want to confess a sin you 're going to commit ? " " I do . " " Is this some sort of a game or a " " No , no , not a game , " the man said . " I 'm deadly serious . Are you getting angry yet ? " A burst of laughter , as jarring as the sound of gunfire in the middle of the night , shot through the grille . Tom was careful to keep his voice neutral when he answered . " No , I 'm not angry , but I am confused . Surely you realize you ca n't be given absolution for sins you 're contemplating . Forgiveness is for those who have realized their mistakes and are truly contrite . They 're willing to make restitution for their sins . " " Ah , but Father , you do n't know what the sins are yet . How can you deny me absolution ? " " Naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does . A year ago I told another priest exactly what I was going to do , but he did n't believe me until it was too late . Do n't make the same mistake . " " How do you know the priest did n't believe you ? " " He did n't try to stop me . That 's how I know . " " How long have you been a Catholic ? " " All my life . " " Then you know that a priest can not acknowledge the sin or the sinner outside of the confessional . The seal of silence is sacred . Exactly how could this other priest have stopped you ? " " He could have found a way . I was ... practicing then , and I was cautious . It would have been very easy for him to stop me , so it 's his fault , not mine . It wo n't be easy now . " Tom was desperately trying to make sense out of what the man was saying . Practice ? Practice what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I thought I could control it , " the man said . " Control what ? " " The craving . " " What was the sin you confessed ? " " Her name was Millicent . A nice , old-fashioned name , do n't you think ? Her friends called her Millie , but I did n't . I much preferred Millicent . Of course , I was n't what you would call a friend . " Another burst of laughter pierced the dead air . Tom 's forehead was beaded with perspiration , but he suddenly felt cold . This was n't a prankster . He dreaded what he was going to hear , yet he was compelled to ask . " What happened to Millicent ? " " I broke her heart . " " I do n't understand ... " " What do you think happened to her ? " the man demanded , his impatience clear now . " I killed her . It was messy ; there was blood everywhere , all over me . I was terribly inexperienced back then . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession , I had n't killed her yet . I was still in the planning stage and the priest could have stopped me , but he did n't . I told him what I was going to do . " " Tell me , how could he have stopped you ? " " Prayer , " he answered , a shrug in his voice . " I told him to pray for me , but he did n't pray hard enough , now did he ? I still killed her . It 's a pity , really . She was such a pretty little thing ... much prettier than the others . " Dear God , there were other women ? How many others ? " How many crimes have you " The stranger interrupted him . " Sins , Father , " he said . " I committed sins , but I might have been able to resist if the priest had helped me . He would n't give me what I needed . " " What did you need ? " " Absolution and acceptance . I was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grille . Rage that must have been simmering just below the surface erupted full force as he spewed out in grotesque detail exactly what he had done to the poor innocent Millicent . Tom was overwhelmed and sickened by the horror of it all . Dear God , what should he do ? He had boasted he would n't be shocked or angered , but nothing could have prepared him for the atrocities the stranger took such delight in describing . Hate the sin , not the sinner . " I 've gotten a real taste for it , " the madman whispered . " How many other women have you killed ? " " Millicent was the first . There were other infatuations , and when they disappointed me , I had to hurt them , but I did n't kill any of them . After I met Millicent , everything changed . I watched her for a long time and everything about her was ... perfect . " His voice turned into a snarl as he continued . " But she betrayed me , just like the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men and I would n't notice . I could n't let her torment me that way . I would n't , " he corrected . " I had to punish her . " He let out a loud , exaggerated sigh and then chuckled . " I killed the little bitch twelve months ago and I buried her deep , real deep . No one 's ever going to find her . There 's no going back now . No , sirree . I had no idea how thrilling the kill was going to be . I made Millicent beg me for mercy , and she did . By God , she did . " He laughed . " She screamed like a pig , and oh , how I loved the sound . I got so excited , more excited than I could ever have imagined was possible , and so I had to make her scream more , did n't I ? When I was finished with her , I was bursting with joy . Well , Father , are n't you going to ask me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you are n't contrite . " A suffocating silence filled the confessional . And then , in a serpent 's hiss , the voice returned . " The craving 's come back . " Goose bumps covered Tom 's arms . " There are people who can " " Do you think I should be locked away ? I only punish those who hurt me . So you see , I 'm not culpable . But you think I 'm sick , do n't you ? We 're in confession , Father . You have to tell the truth . " " Yes , I think you 're ill . " " Oh , I do n't think so . I 'm just dedicated . " " There are people who can help you . " " I 'm brilliant , you know . It wo n't be easy to stop me . I study my clients before I take them on . I know everything about their families and their friends . Everything . Yes , it 's going to be much harder to stop me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult for me . Do you see ? I do n't want to sin . I really do n't . " The singsong voice was back . " Listen to me , " Tom pleaded . " Step outside the confessional with me and we 'll sit down together and talk this through . I want to help you , if you 'll only let me . " " No , I needed help before and I was denied , remember ? Give me absolution . " " I will not . " The sigh was long and drawn out . " Very well , " he said . " I 'm changing the rules this time . You have my permission to tell anyone you want to tell . Do you see how accommodating I can be ? " " It does n't matter if you give me permission to tell or not , this conversation will remain confidential . The seal of silence must be maintained to protect the integrity of the confessional . " " No matter what I confess ? " " No matter what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demand all you want , but it wo n't make any difference . I can not tell anyone what you have said to me . I wo n't . " A moment of silence passed and then the stranger began to chuckle . " A priest with scruples . How extraordinary . Hmmm . What a quandary . But do n't you fret , Father . I 'm ten steps ahead of you . Yes , sirree . " " What are you saying ? " " I 've taken on a new client . " " You 've already chosen your next " The madman cut him off . " I 've already notified the authorities . They 'll get my letter soon . Of course that was before I knew you were going to be such a stickler for the rules . Still , it was considerate of me , was n't it ? I sent them a polite little note explaining my intentions . Pity I forgot to sign it . " " Did you give them the name of the person you intend to harm ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . Yes , I named her . " " Another woman , then ? " Tom 's voice broke on the question . " I only take women on as clients . " " Did you explain in the note your reason for wanting to kill this woman ? " " No . " " Do you have a reason ? " " Yes . " " Would you explain it to me ? " " Practice , Father . " " I do n't understand . " " Practice makes perfect , " he said . " This one 's even more special than Millicent . I wrap myself in her fragrance , and I love to watch her sleep . She 's so beautiful . Ask me , and after I 've given you her name , you can forgive me . " " I will not give you absolution . " " How 's the chemotherapy going ? Are you feeling sick ? Did you get a good report ? " Tom 's head snapped up . " What ? " he demanded in a near shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study my clients before I take them on . You could say I stalk them , " he whispered . " How did you know " " Oh , Tommy , you 've been such a sport . Have n't you wondered why I followed you all this way just to confess my sins to you ? Think about it on your way back to the abbey . I 've done my homework , have n't I ? " " Who are you ? " " Why , I 'm a heartbreaker . And I do so love a challenge . Make this one difficult for me . The police will come here soon to talk to you , and then you 'll be able to tell anyone you want , " he mocked . " I know who you 'll call first . Your hotshot friend with the FBI . You 'll call Nick , wo n't you ? I sure hope you will . And he 'll come running to help . You 'd better tell him to take her away and hide her from me . I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . At least I 'll try . " " How do you know " " Ask me . " " Ask you what ? " Her name , " the madman whispered . " Ask me who my client is . " " I urge you to get help , " Tom began again . " What you 're doing " " Ask me . Ask me . Ask me . " Tom closed his eyes . " Yes . Who is she ? " " She 's lovely , " he answered . " Such beautiful full breasts and long , dark hair . There is n't a mark on her perfect body , and her face is like an angel 's , so exquisite in every way . She 's ... breathtaking ... but I plan to take her breath away . " " Tell me her name , " Tom demanded , praying to God there was time to get to the poor woman to protect her . " Laurant , " the serpent whispered . " Her name is Laurant . " Panic hit Tom like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . Now you 're getting it , Father . I 'm going to kill your sister . "
