<p> GERMANTOWN , Md.  --  Frank Warren is knee-deep in secrets : They 're overflowing boxes , piled on tables , leaning against walls  --  closing in on 30,000 at last estimate , and hundreds of new ones are arriving every week . <p> Warren is unperturbed ; secrets have become his life . Not his secrets , mind you  --  America 's secrets . And they 're beginning to make him famous . He has become an award-winning blogger , a first-time author , an artist with a traveling exhibit , a possible documentary subject , the inspiration for a music video and the all-around media " it " boy of the moment . <p> It could n't happen to a more unlikely guy . In a culture that rewards hip-and-mocking , Warren , 41 , has to be the most unsnarky man in America . Lanky , soft-spoken and earnest , he is the antithesis of the Jon Stewart crowd , but he 's becoming a cultural force almost as popular as Mr. Snarky himself . Warren is , as his publisher puts it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " <p> " I 've been surprised every step of the way , " Warren says . " I 'm just a typical suburban husband . I 'm an accidental artist . It 's been quite a journey , quite an adventure . " <p> And all because of his blog , PostSecret . com . It started out as Warren 's temporary community art project . Now it 's where thousands of Americans go to anonymously post their deepest secrets , and where millions of Americans go to read them . Secret-tellers  --  call them " confessors "  --  send their secrets to his home here in suburban Washington , D.C. , on postcards they decorate themselves . Warren reads every one and picks 10 to 20 to post on his blog every Sunday . <p> They are mini works of art . Some are heartbreaking , some are hilarious , some are touching or thought-provoking or shocking or silly or repulsive . All of them are riveting , especially the ones about the big stuff : sex and death . <p> For many readers , PostSecret is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and new tech ( the Internet ) that produces something never seen before . <p> " People are drawn to this because it 's something powerful and raw and real that speaks to them , " Warren says . " I try to keep it ideologically neutral and juxtapose the cards in a way that 's balanced and non-judgmental . " <p> This week , PostSecret featured these : a card bearing an image of a baby wrapped in a pink blanket with a note reading , " Please take care of my baby . " And these words pasted over it : " i have always wanted to find a baby on my doorstep . ( and keep it . ) " Another showed a sand trap on a golf course with the words " I have never played a round without cheating . " A picture of a colorfully wrapped present reads , " I hate opening a gift in front of the person that gave it to me . " <p> And that 's it . There 's no bloggy pontificating . There are no ads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postcards plus a few instructions on how to submit , a legal notice , a picture of his home mailbox and a link to a suicide hotline ( hopeline.com ) for which Warren has been a longtime volunteer . <p> Yet just a year after its launch , PostSecret is a smash hit . It 's the third-most-popular blog in the blogosphere of nearly 30 million blogs , based on the number of other blogs that link to it , according to Technorati , the leading blog-tracking service . Nielsen BuzzMetrics says PostSecret always is in the top 20 at blog-watching BlogPulse.com every Monday morning . It also gets 2.3 million unique visitors a month and 3 million page loads a month , according to another Web-measuring service , StatCounter.com . <p> This week it won a record five Bloggies in the sixth annual weblog awards , including the top prize , Weblog of the Year . Warren 's book , PostSecret : Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives , a compilation of 400 postcards , is selling well enough after three months that he 's planning four more . <p> Publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment for her talk show on Sirius Satellite Radio , says she embraced PostSecret because it 's about " the human heart exposed . " <p> " The reader and viewer can feel the conflict , pain and pathos of the authors , " she says . " I thought that ( readers ) would respond because the secrets are authentic and moving . " <p> His blog is the worst-kept secret <p> Meanwhile , an exhibit of 2,000 PostSecret postcards in Washington earlier in the year attracted thousands of viewers ; some waited in line for hours , even on a Sunday when the Redskins were fighting to stay in the playoffs . The exhibit is scheduled to open in Philadelphia in June . <p> Several filmmakers are courting Warren for potential TV documentaries about PostSecret , and he says the National Postal Museum is talking to him about doing an exhibit . PostSecret postcards were even featured last year in the All-American Rejects ' music video for their hit Dirty Little Secret . <p> Warren has been featured on the Today show , National Public Radio and in dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blog one of the world 's 50 " coolest " websites . The New York Times called it " consistently engaging " and " original . " It made the Chicago Tribune 's list of top 50 best websites . <p> There was talk of doing Letterman , although Warren nixed that . " The last thing I want to do is go on national TV and laugh at people 's secrets , " he says . <p> Art , therapy , voyeurism <p> " It went from obscurity to being in the top five for the last six months , " says Technorati spokesman Derek " DJ " Gordon . Blogs with " a unique voice or point of view almost always get recognized , " he says . " This one was absolutely fresh and engaging , and now it has a huge following . " <p> Sue MacDonald , a marketing official at Nielsen BuzzMetrics and chief blogger at BlogPulse.com , says people love PostSecret for different reasons . " Some love the art , some love the therapy , some love its voyeuristic nature , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a simple idea . ... Frank has combined several different media  --  postcards , the mailbox , blogging , artwork , e-mail conversations  --  to create a breakthrough idea . " <p> Now Warren is so busy that he barely has time for his small business supplying medical documents . His wife , Jan , and an assistant have taken over much of the work as PostSecret has taken over Warren . <p> Jan Warren is feeling a little shell-shocked by all the attention , especially after the cover of the book featured their actual address . " We 're talking about looking for a new house , " she laughs , a little grimly . <p> So far , nothing bad has come from PostSecret , although she worries about its effect on their privacy and their daughter Hailey , 11 . <p> " It all happened so quickly . It just snowballed on us , " she says . " The biggest thing for me is the mess . I do n't like clutter . " <p> Too late for that . Thousands of postcards passing through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in an " undisclosed secure location "  --  can make for a lot of clutter . And some people at the local post office hate him , Warren says sheepishly . <p> A repository for secrets untold <p> It all started a few years ago when Warren went through a difficult period in his life that he does n't detail . He turned to art projects , figuring that art is n't just for trained elites . <p> In his third project , he began handing out blank postcards to strangers in Metro stations , inviting them to decorate the card and share a long-hidden secret , something never shared before . <p> Soon hundreds of cards were pouring into his mailbox . He put them up in his exhibit space at Artomatic , the annual Washington art show open to anyone who is willing to pay a small fee . " In four weeks the show was over , and I thought it would end , but the secrets kept coming and from all across the country . " <p> So he created the blog . He long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail anyway , and now many are coming via e-mail . <p> " It 's the best source of free therapy I could ever ask for , " says Nicole Clayton , 31 , of Frederick , Md. , whose postcard was on the blog last year . It featured a photo of a beautiful couple frolicking on a beach , the kind that 's a place holder for a photo in an empty frame . The card read , " I wish my life was more like this picture frame insert . " <p> Making the card offered a " moment of self-clarification , " Clayton says . " It 's hard to admit that sometimes you wish your life had taken a different path . It 's hard to admit you 're not where you expected you would be . " <p> PostSecret seems to prove three ( at least ) things : Lots of ordinary Americans are artistic , lots of them are poetic , and lots of them have something to hide . <p> " Everybody has secrets ; it 's part of being a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and author of the forthcoming Anatomy of a Secret Life , about how secrets are formed and how they can cross into dangerous territory . She says the worst secrets are the kind people keep from themselves , so PostSecret can be a boon to both confessors and readers . <p> " He has provided a forum that enables people to feel like they 're sharing or getting a secret off their chests but without any risk . They have the catharsis without being exposed , " Saltz says . <p> People love to read this stuff , because " human beings are normally voyeuristic and curious , and it allows you to really identify with the posters , " she says . <p> She worries that someone who is suicidal might feel worse by sharing a secret and getting no response , but she says Warren ca n't do much about that except what he already has done with his link to the hotline . " He 's done everything he can do to be responsible , " she says . <p> But Evan Imber-Black , a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says telling secrets has no meaning except in the context of family relationships . <p> " We live in a time where people have the mistaken idea that you tell a secret to the multitudes on TV  --  and move on , " she says . " But opening a secret is just the first step . ( Posting on PostSecret ) might offer some measure of relief , but I 'm not sure how long it lasts . When a secret opens , it usually takes time and relational work to get a new equilibrium . " <p> Maybe so , but Warren is no therapist , and he 's beginning to wonder : Where does this all end ? It already has reached the point that readers out there in blogland go into a panic  --  scores of e-mails fill up his mailbox  --  when he 's even a little late posting new cards . <p> " My wife 's big fear is that 40 years from now when we 've retired to Boca Raton , secrets will still track us down .
