Clutter is an unloved side effect of modern life . Here 's how to find more room and make peace with your stuff . It 's hidden inside the walls , beneath the stairs , in places you 'd never think to look . The solution to the great American storage crunch is all around us in the form of unused space  --  cavities and nooks ready to absorb clutter and help bring order to domestic chaos . As a longtime carpenter and builder , and now the host of Wasted Spaces , a new show on the DIY Network , I 've specialized in finding quick and efficient ways to make use of these little-used storage resources .

Here , a seating nook and storage bin replace an almost unusable understair closet . &lt;hln&gt;&lt;/hln&gt; Illustrations by Agustin Chung One of my favorite tricks  --  building drawers and shelves beneath a staircase  --  came into play in the home of Sarah and Rob Eddins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddins 's foyer was jammed with book bags , shoes , toys and coats  --  all reminiscent of my own home , where my wife and I work to contain the disorder left in the wake of our toddler son . The result of the Eddins project can be seen at right , with details on the following pages . Plenty more storage solutions can be found throughout the typical house . With a little creativity and basic carpentry skills , any homeowner can win the space race . Here 's how to start  --  without getting into trouble . Photograph : The author ( left ) and homeowner Bruce Meek 's son Christopher build a knee-wall cabinet , using a sheet of oriented strand board and some lumber as a work surface . Assembling a cabinet on a flat surface keeps parts square to each other as they are fastened . BE RUTHLESS First , move everything that 's cluttering a room into another area . Organize it into three piles : everyday must-haves , items for long-term storage and stuff you can give away . Pile the long-term storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and place the day-to-day necessities back where you got them . GET CREATIVE Now , take a fresh look around . In a typical house , there 's space waiting to be tapped behind knee walls where a roof cuts through a room , above appliances and underneath cathedral ceilings . Even a standard stud cavity inside a wall is 31/2 in. deep  --  enough space for toiletries , canned goods and some office supplies . AVOID WIRING AND PIPES Before opening any walls , inspect the house from the attic to the basement to see where electrical wiring , phone and data cables , air-conditioning ducts , and water and waste piping may be hiding . Everything seem clear ? Use a drywall saw to cut a neat inspection hatch . If you find mechanical systems in the wall , it 's no big deal to reinstall the drywall patch and seal it with joint compound . WATCH YOUR BEARINGS The typical roof rests on a house 's outside walls and the inside walls that run perpendicular to the rafters and joists . Do n't touch these load-bearing walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a different story . The load rests on the outside walls ; in most cases the interior walls underneath can be altered  --  just be careful not to damage the truss by ripping out any hardware attaching the truss to the wall . BE NEAT Prepare your work area by removing furniture , taping dropcloths to baseboards , and using plastic sheets over passageways to prevent dust from migrating throughout the house . GET CLEARANCE During planning , make sure that doors and drawers will be able to open fully in the newly reconfigured area . And leave enough room to walk around comfortably . KEEP THE MESS OUTSIDE Build cabinets in the yard to keep the indoors neater . Just make sure that anything you build is n't too big to fit through the door . Do n't laugh : I 've seen it happen . BEHIND WALLS A LOW CABINET YIELDS NEW STORAGE FOR TOYS AND BOOKS &gt;&gt; One of my favorite construction tricks is to build boxes out of birch plywood as a way to avoid complicated framing jobs in tight spaces . I use the boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making use of the generous cavity behind a knee wall , the partial-height structure built where a roof slopes down through a room . Since a knee wall usually does n't carry any structural load , it 's easy to cut a large opening in it . Once that 's done , I build a box to fit , spreading a bead of yellow glue on each joint and then firing in a few finishing nails with a pneumatic nailer . I continue fastening the pieces with coarse-thread drywall screws . The result : a self-supporting structure that I slide into place on runners I 've nailed to the plywood subfloor . Adding simple shelving and drawers can yield plenty of storage space . However , in the project shown here , for the seven-member Meek household , I went further , adding two swing-out box shelves that provide access to the wedge-shaped space at the cabinet 's back . A small gap on the side of each box shelf allows for free movement ; I concealed the openings with a small vertical panel . Each hinge is nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph : There 's no need to accept a poorly designed front foyer , where guests sit on the stairs to tie their shoes , and backpacks litter the floor . Here , the space beneath the staircase was divided into two areas , providing seating and plenty of short-term storage . UNDER STAIRS A PULLOUT BIN AND NEW SEAT CLEAR ENTRYWAY CLUTTER &gt;&gt; When I hunt through a home for wasted space , I usually head right for the stairs . The area beneath them is often completely unused , or else squandered on a narrow , poorly designed closet . A single large drawer or several smaller ones stacked on top of each other can provide lots of storage in the low space at the foot of the stairs . A seating alcove makes excellent use of the taller area underneath the top of the staircase . I built both types of structure for the Eddins family . Before doing any demolition , I checked to see if any mechanical systems ran through the walls  --  and found an air-conditioning return to watch out for . Then , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked out the wall and carefully cut through the drywall with a reciprocating saw . A modern stair with a straight run is nearly always self-supporting  --  the walls on either side of it rarely carry a structural load . That was true in the Eddins 's foyer , and I was able to remove essentially one entire wall . Once I got inside , I framed around the air-conditioning return . Then , I built a series of birch plywood boxes that became the seating alcove , a pullout bin and a shoe shelf . For the drawers , I used heavy-duty slides that extend fully , to provide easy access to the contents . After I installed all those elements , I was ready to reframe the wall and put up drywall to finish the job . <p>
