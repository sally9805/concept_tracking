CORRECTION : Published July , 2004 page 8 CORRECTIONAn article about the core77 Design Challenge in the May " What 's New " section incorrectly stated that the Cetusdiving suit could cause decompression sickness if a diverheld his breath and ascended quickly to the surface . Infact , the suit is only intended for surface breathing ; the risk of decompression sickness is marginal . Your dashboard speedometer shows more than velocity . That little dial also measures optimism . Speed is all about getting where we want to go , certainly , but it 's also about enjoying the ride . Our hardwired impulse to pull ahead at every turn inspired the question : How can we find fresh ways to incorporate speed into our everyday lives ? To field answers , we issued a challenge via Core77 ( an online design community that receives 250,000 visits a day ) . Following are the four designs we 'd like to see built  --  tomorrow . Of course , moving from high-concept to working model is no easy task . So we also asked experts to help our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Visit popsci.com to see the other fine entries . Future design challenges will be posted at core77.com . GRAND PRIZE WINNER DRIVE ON YOUR CARRY-ON TRANSPORTER Yen-Hung Lin , Taoyuan , Taiwan Your luggage already has wheels and a handle  --  why not an engine ? Along with your clothes , the Transporter packs a fuel cell and an electric motor . Push a button and out pop handgrips and a footboard . In scooter mode the Transporter 's short wheelbase and hardened ABS shell make it ideal for cutting through crowded terminals or navigating a busy sidewalk . Just twist the throttle to accelerate , or step on the fender-like splash guard to brake . Once you 've dusted the Louis Vuitton Luddites , fold in the spring-loaded footboard and take your place at the front of the line . REALITY CHECKER J. Douglas Field , CTO , Segway " I applaud this idea : A new concept hidden in a product very familiar to everyday consumers . By making it look and work like a suitcase , the designer is improving its chances of acceptance . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a reasonably priced , mass-produced Transporter is likely to need batteries . The designer will need to make tradeoffs between the performance desired and the size and weight of the batteries . " SINGLE-DIGIT TEXT MESSAGING QUICKEY Yoshikazu Hoshino , San Francisco Text messaging on handhelds is about as efficient as chatting in Morse code . The QuicKey frees you from the tyranny of tiny keypads , keyboards and styluses with a design you can operate with a single thumb . The alphabet is laid out along four touch-sensitive bars . For S , run your thumb along the O-through-U bar , and push down when the letter pops up on the screen . Punctuation marks are tucked in after Z ; the input bars double as a numeric keypad for the cellphone . The display slides into the handset like a switchblade when you 're ready to stop messaging and start gabbing . REALITY CHECKER Scott Henderson , Industrial Design Director , Smart Design " Overall , the design is great . It reminds me of some sort of ice pop . Problems ? I could n't figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown in upper- and lowercase , so you 're scrolling through 52 characters overall , rather than just 26 . That would work . The tendency is for people thinking about alternative data entry to take quantum leaps , and then they produce something that nobody 's familiar with . People will try to learn something only for five or 10 seconds , and this breaks down the technology to make it real friendly . This says , ' OK , you 're used to scrolling and selecting  --  let 's make scrolling and selecting much easier . ' " THE CHILL MACHINE WORKPLACE PACEMAKER Ryan Jordan , Toronto It 's 7 p.m. , your project 's overdue , the phone 's ringing , and you still have n't eaten lunch . Lucky for you , the Workplace Pacemaker knows how to handle the situation . It knows that when you get stressed , you 're more susceptible to being distracted by unimportant interruptions , which compounds the problem . The solution ? As you work , an array of biometric sensors on a wristwatch transmitter keeps track of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you move into the red zone , the system will shunt low-priority e-mails into read-later folders and send calls to voicemail . Yet it 's smart enough to patch the boss right through . REALITY CHECKER Scott Geisler , Human Factors Engineer , General Motors " What 's fascinating about this design is the idea that speed may not be what you 're after . But if my heart rate elevates because I had too much caffeine , is my system going to hold me back because I 'm jazzed ? The real challenge here would be to determine the right threshold to start filtering things . Where you monitor biometrics may be a factor  --  the wrist may or may not be optimal . Inside of a year , you could probably get a system that would have this wristwatch and a wireless connection to the biofeed display . But to complete the design after that could take anywhere from a week to infinity . " POWER DIVING CETUS DIVING SUIT Emre Ergene , Istanbul Named after the Latin word for " large sea creature , " the Cetus diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the surface . Three eco-friendly jet engines ( they 're battery-powered ) propel you under the water for as long as you can hold your breath . Should you need to juke some toothy leviathan , use your legs : Sensors at your hips and knees detect movement and redirect the neoprene suit 's jet nozzles accordingly . The helmet is sealed to keep water out , but does n't maintain air pressure  --  it 's ported with a snorkel at the back for cruising on the surface . It 's also made of hard plastic to protect your neck from whiplash . Seriously . REALITY CHECKER Dan Paterson , Training Director , Professional Scuba Association " Primarily , my concern would be safety , especially with not having the use of your legs in the event you 'd need to swim . Say the diver were entangled in kelp , and the engine stalled . I imagine the guy is supposed to hit a button and the airbag will carry him to the surface . Physiologically , a diver has to maintain a steady ascent rate , no faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough without a jet pack . If you were to descend to 99 feet , hold your breath and ascend directly to the surface , your lungs would explode . " POPSCI/CORE77 Table <p>
