ONE THE VICTIM <br> I <br> A rthur Deco Junior was behaving like Euro-trash . <p> He was spending his trust fund on drugs and drink , cavorting with weird , freaky friends , and wearing bizarre clothes . Art Deco had let his hair grow down to his shoulders . He wore an earring in one ear . Strange objects dangled from his neck . He had put on weight . He looked nothing like his original self . Friends of his family had no idea who Arthur Deco Junior was when they passed him on the street in New York , and therefore did n't report his bizarre behavior to his father in Bowling Green , Kentucky . <p> Art roamed all over the East Village with half-wit friends until the wee hours of the morning , zonked out of his mind on alcohol , assorted narcotics , and hallucinogens inhaled , injected , taken down the throat , and up the ass . When the evening had finally gone belly-up , the drugged heir to a monstrous Kentucky fortune would hitch a ride back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck going his way . The workers of the New York Sanitation Department 's midnight-to-eight shift knew Arthur Deco Junior well . They referred to him as Young Artie . <p> Junior was living an existential life . Or trying to . He was attempting to exist in the moment and to the max . It was the popular thing to do among the Village crowd at the time . Art Deco had never lived life to the max . Not even in school . He was never popular . He was always terribly introverted , with tons of complexes . The problem , as Arthur Deco Junior saw it , was Arthur Deco Senior , his father . Always pressuring him to do better ; to be a better student than he was , to be a better athlete than he was , and eventually to be a better Chairman of the Board than Senior could 've ever hoped to be . The pressure had a reverse effect . Junior did n't want to be any of those things . <p> Arthur Deco Junior was sent to Andover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the university Arthur Deco Senior had attended ; and to Harvard Law School , the law school Arthur Deco Senior had attended . Junior was to become a lawyer and then Chairman of the Board of Deco Industries . It was all written in stone . <p> Arthur Deco Junior could n't remember having a smidgen of fun during his entire education . That included grammar school . Having fun was not part of the Deco vocabulary . All the Deco family ever did was work . Not me , Junior swore to himself  --  he was going to have fun before being incarcerated for the rest of his natural life behind the walls of Deco Industries ' home office in Bowling Green , Kentucky . <p> The first thing Arthur Deco Junior did was quit the law firm that employed him . Then young Deco went off to do some serious hellraising . One example of Junior 's idea of fun was hanging out with his two friends , Basil Sweeney and Ray Barno , two bozos of subnormal intelligence . The threesome generally trolled the Village whacked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Junior hang out with garbage ? Simply because Barno and Sweeney let Art tag along . No one else would . Arthur Deco Junior was a dork . <p> Art 's friends , Barno and Sweeney , were always broke . They either scrounged dinners from Salvation Army cafeterias or washed dishes in the kitchens of scuzzy little restaurants for meals . The two usually slept in shelters for the homeless . <p> Junior did n't eat in Salvation Army cafeterias or sleep in homeless shelters . When he was uptown and not slumming with his Neanderthal friends , wealthy Art Deco chose to eat in expensive East Side restaurants and sleep in his impressive apartment in a building on the corner of Eighty-third and Park Avenue , about as prestigious an address as you could find in Manhattan . <p> Art 's apartment was a six-thousand-square-foot duplex , decorated with expensive furniture , paintings , and sculpture . It was here Art Deco brought New York 's flotsam and jetsam , bums like Barno and Sweeney , other assorted ne'er-do-wells , scuzzy bimbos , and of course his buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Junior 's father , Arthur Deco Senior , had no idea what his son was up to and the life he was leading . God knows the size of the fit he would have had if he found out . <p> Senior 's father , a hugely successful farmer named Ballard Deco , had been known as the Tobacco King of the South . Son Arthur returned from Korea , borrowed money from Ballard , and founded a small hardware store in the family 's hometown of Bowling Green , Kentucky . The hardware store , driven by the son 's ambition and ingenuity , evolved into Deco Industries : a conglomerate that included Deco Petroleum , Deco Pharmaceuticals , Deco Home-Owners Insurance Corporation of America , several radio and television stations , two newspapers , Deco Computer , Inc. ( the backbone of the conglomerate ) , and the original hardware store . <p> Deco Industries employed nineteen thousand employees worldwide , with plants and offices in Bowling Green , Houston , Chicago , New York , London , Hamburg , Rome , and Hong Kong . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Chief Executive Officer of the empire . Both Old Man Ballard and his son Arthur were rich and testy sons-of-bitches . <p> Upon his father 's death , Arthur Deco assumed the title Senior . <p> Arthur Deco Senior married beautiful Margaret Hollingford when the two attended Western Kentucky University thirty-four years ago . The couple produced son Arthur ( now age twenty-eight ) , the oldest of the Deco children , called Junior and heir to the throne ; two married daughters , Harriet Deco Strange ( twenty-six ) , called Hattie , Elizabeth Deco Brown ( twenty-four ) , called Lizzie ; and one unmarried daughter , Seena Deco ( twenty-two ) . Arthur Deco Senior 's family were Methodist and Republican . <p> Arthur Deco Senior and his daughter Mrs. Hattie Deco Strange were also extremely anti-Semitic , racist , and major homophobes . <p> It was a Saturday in late October when Arthur Deco Senior decided to have his son flown to his favorite mountain in Myles Standish State Park in Massachusetts , to see how the boy was getting on . <br> 2 <br> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low as he could in his twin-engine Cessna Mustang . He had been on one of his solo trips from their home in Bowling Green , Kentucky , to the family compound in Camden , Maine . It was during these solo trips that Senior liked to " explore " the countryside just above the tree line . The flat-topped mountain was almost in the center of the Myles Standish State Forest . The good thing about the mountaintop was that two helicopters could land comfortably on its crown . <p> On this particular Saturday , Senior piloted his Bell 429 helicopter from Bowling Green to Massachusetts , with several stops along the way for fuel . The founder of Deco Industries owned two Bell helicopters . He kept one in New York , the one he sent to pick up his son . Junior was waiting at the helicopter pad on Thirty-fourth Street adjacent to the East River Drive in Manhattan . He was flown from there to the mountain . <p> Art Deco was sick and tired of thinking about seeing his father . It always meant trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather only added to Junior 's unhappiness and discomfort . Meeting his father usually augured a lecture , an argument , or both . <p> Junior was the first to arrive on the mountaintop . His father landed next . Arthur Deco Senior climbed out of his helicopter wearing his grandfather 's hand-me-down World War I leather flying helmet that snapped on under his chin , a yellow scarf , and his Navy Air Force leather jacket with all his old squadron emblems sewn on it . Ballard Deco 's father had used the leather flying helmet in World War I. Ballard had used it in World War II . His son , Arthur , had worn the flying helmet in Korea . <p> Arthur Deco Senior was furious when he saw his son . " My God , Junior , your hair looks like a girl 's . " <p> " Thank you , Father . " <p> " I want you to cut it . " <p> " It 's the style , Father . " <p> " It may be the style in Jew York , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style in Bowling Green , Kentucky . " <p> The two men glared at each other . Both could hear the October wind blowing through the trees . Gray-black clouds skittered across the sky . The air was heavy with rain . Junior was freezing . He was only wearing a leather jacket and a black T-shirt that said UP YOURS in white letters on the front . The T-shirt was hidden by his buttoned-up jacket . <p> " From now on , Junior , when you come to meet me you dress accordingly . Understand ? " <p> " Yes sir . " <p> Junior wondered why he had never dressed " accordingly " when coming to see his father . Probably to get the automatic rise out of the old man he always got . He hoped one day the shock of seeing him not dressed accordingly would kill him . Cause the old goat to have a fatal heart attack , or a stroke , or something . Nothing would please Junior more than surprising his father in such a way as to cause his death . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had dropped dead on the street in Bowling Green . Fat chance . The old man was healthy as a horse . Junior was convinced Senior would outlive him by twenty years . <p> Tough as nails , was how most people described Arthur Deco Senior . And he was , thought Art . The mean bastard will die in bed over a hundred years old . No pain , no strain ; just one minute his eyes are open , and the next they 're shut . His family will be standing around his bed kissing his ass , or trying to , until the bitter end . <p> Art would n't be at his father 's funeral . Seena would go grudgingly . His mother and sisters , mean Hattie and wishy-washy Elizabeth and their boot-licking husbands , would be standing around Senior 's bed , along with the family 's kowtowing butler , Donald . They all would be hoping for handouts . Hattie wishing her father would say , Hattie , I want you to run the company . Lizzie hoping he 'd say , Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And always have been . And Donald , the suck-up butler , praying the old bastard would say , And Donald , I bequeath you one million dollars . Fat chance of any of that happening . <p> " Do something about your goddamned hair , you hear ? " barked Arthur Deco Senior , snapping Junior out of his daydream . " I want your hair looking normal , not like some kind of fairy , next time I see you . " <p> " Yes sir . " <p> " Are you a fairy , son ? Do n't lie to me . " <p> " No , Father , I am not a fairy . " <p> " What are you , then , with your damned long hair , and little diamond earring in the lobe of your ear , and all those ... those ... trinkets around your neck ? " <p> " I 'm me , Father . " <p> " And what the hell kind of answer is that ? ' I 'm me . ' " <p> " What do you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ashamed of walking around the law firm with that pansy hairdo ? " <p> " No , I 'm not . " <p> " And those clothes . Even though it 's a weekend , how can a decent , churchgoing , American Christian wear clothes like that ? Tell me , Junior , why ... why do you wear such ... such ... " <p> " Clothing ? " offered Junior . <p> " Yes . " Senior sounded relieved . He was referring to Junior 's black leather jacket with all the silver studs , and the thin , tightfitting black leather pants that outlined his son 's ass and balls . <p> " You wear watermelon slacks and sherbert-colored sweaters , " said Junior , " and nobody yells at you . If that outfit does n't look gay , I do n't know what does . " <p> " Be careful how you talk to me , son , " said Senior , smiling an evil smile . As if a snake had tried to grin . <p> " Yes sir . " <p> " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " tell me this . Are you dating a Jew ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Are you dating a colored ? " <p> " No . " <p> " So what is it ? You 're guilty about something , so get it the hell off your chest . " <p> " I quit my job , " confessed Junior . " I 'm not working at Schatzberg , Downey , and Pels anymore . " <p> " You did what ? You quit working for  --  Do you know how many strings I pulled to get you that job ? How hard I came down on that firm ? I had to work like a dog to get you into Schatzberg , Downey , and Pels . " <p> " I know how hard you pressured them to take me , " said Junior . " Everyone in the law firm reminded me of that every single day . That 's part of why I quit the damn job . " <p> " What 's the other part ? Too many Jews in the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me tha  --  " <p> " I do n't want to be a lawyer , Father . I do n't want to work in a law firm , because all that means is I 'll be a lawyer for Deco Industries sooner or later . " <p> " What 's so bad about that ? And it would only be for a short time . You 'll be chairman of the board when I retire . " <p> " Oh , come off it , Father , you 're not going to retire . Not in my lifetime . Besides , I do n't want to be Chairman of the Board of Deco Industries . That 's no fun . I want to do something better with my life . " <p> " Deco Industries is n't good enough for you ? The business I built with my two hands , slaved over , worked in good times and bad , none of that 's good enough for my only son ? Well , that 's interesting . So what is the ' something better ' you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " A what ? A veterinarian ? You want to spend your life sticking your hand up a mare 's doohickey feeling around for her foal ? " <p> " Yes sir . That 's what I want to do . " <p> " Well , you ca n't be a veterinarian . It would be a disgrace if you did n't carry on the Deco name in the family business ; the business I spent my entire working life building is not the business I 'm going to give to a total stranger . " <p> " Let Hattie run Deco Industries . She 's always wanted to do that . " <p> " I 'm going to hand Deco Industries over to my son , and that 's final . " <br> 3 <br> <p> T here was something Junior did n't tell his father that windy afternoon on the mountaintop . Art did n't mention anything about the girl he intended to marry . Not yet . Art wanted to surprise Senior . ut first he wanted to make sure he had her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did n't want to jinx getting the judge 's approval . <p> The young lady Art Deco wanted to marry was Carrie Vandeveer . <p> They 'd met on a blind date . Carrie was the youngest of four beautiful sisters in a prominent South Carolina family . Carrie Vandeveer was a friend of Art 's sister Seena . The two girls went to the Mannerly Methodist Girls School , an exclusive  --  and expensive  --  girls ' prep school outside of Columbia , South Carolina . Carrie was in her first year when Seena was in her last . <p> Seena Deco , who happened to be Junior 's favorite sister , had arranged the blind date . <p> Carrie Vandeveer was nineteen years old and about to start her studies at Columbia University in Manhattan . She was going to be a doctor . Carrie visited New York on weekends looking for an apartment . She came on Friday afternoon and went home on Sunday . When in Manhattan , Miss Vandeveer stayed at the Plaza Hotel . After Art 's sister Seena had made the arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet Carrie at seven-thirty that evening on what turned out to be a beautiful and unseasonably warm Friday night in November . <p> Miss Vandeveer seemed happy to hear that Mr. Deco was in the lobby and told him to come to her room immediately . When he arrived at Room 710 and finally saw Carrie Vandeveer in person , and heard her familiar thick Southern accent , Art Deco was transformed into a hapless bowl of Jell-O . <p> Carrie Vandeveer was five-foot-two with big blue eyes and strawberry blond hair . Her haircut made her hair curve around her head . Junior thought it was the cutest haircut he had ever seen in his entire life . Carrie Vandeveer instantly became the love of Art Deco 's life . His sister Seena was thrilled . <p> " I am so happy to meet you , Arthur , " said Carrie Vandeveer , standing in the open doorway of her room . <p> " Please call me Art . " <p> " Fine . I 'll call you just plain Art , " said Carrie . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you it 's taken me forever to get ready . How do I look , Arthur ? Could you please zip me up ? " Carrie turned her back and Art Deco zipped up her dress . <p> Art hated to be called Arthur . Everyone called his father Arthur . But when Carrie Vandeveer called Art Arthur , it sounded wonderful . <p> During dinner at Lusardi 's on Second Avenue , Art had an idea . <p> " Would you mind coming to my apartment ? " he asked . " I promise you on my word of honor , on my mother 's life , and I love my mother , that I wo n't do anything bad . I mean , ungentlemanly . It 's just such a nice clear night and the view of the city from my terrace , especially the George Washington Bridge , is beautiful . What do you think ? " <p> Art talked very fast . He was almost out of breath when he finished . <p> Carrie Vandeveer laughed and said , " But Arthur , what if we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in danger ? " <p> Junior was confused until Carrie said , " I 'm teasing you . Let 's go . " <p> The pair stood on Art 's terrace and looked at the George Washington Bridge off in the distance . <p> Carrie said , " It really is beautiful , Arthur . " <p> " It is , is n't it ? " <p> And then Carrie Vandeveer put her arms around Art Deco 's neck and kissed him on his lips . For a long time . <p> Art pulled the young girl off the terrace and into his bedroom , where they made love for three days and nights , with breaks for meals , naps , and sleep . Once a day they 'd go to the Plaza Hotel to grab a change of clothes for Carrie and gather up any messages from home she might have had . <p> Art Deco could n't remember ever being so happy . <p> Carrie Vandeveer and Art Deco never missed a weekend . They seldom went out with friends . They ordered in most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Sunday afternoon , except to look for an apartment for Carrie . After a month Art Deco proposed marriage to Carrie Vandeveer . <p> " Unfortunately , " she said , " you 'll have to speak to Daddy . " <p> " Unfortunately ? " <p> " Yes , " said Carrie . " I 've been told Daddy 's one tough cookie . " <br> 4 <br> <p> T he New York Athletic Club was where Junior invited Judge Taylor Vandeveer to lunch to ask permission to marry the judge 's youngest daughter . The father of the four pretty Vandeveer daughters was one of the justices of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina . <p> Judge Vandeveer had been a former All-American lineman for the University of South Carolina 's football team , a former Rhodes Scholar , and a Special Forces Green Beret . Judge Vandeveer was a highly decorated Army major who returned from the Vietnam War with a permanent limp . He was often mentioned for the South Carolina Senate seat , and lately was a possibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a conservative , a constitutional constructionist , severe at times , but reported to be a fair man . <p> Judge Vandeveer entered the main lobby of the NYAC , his cane firmly planted on the marble floor , his gaze covering the huge lobby like a searchlight . Not knowing what an Arthur Deco Junior looked like , the searchlight continued to swivel back and forth . Junior approached and introduced himself . The judge said nothing . Just smiled . Smiling was something the judge rarely did . It looked it . <p> Art led Judge Vandeveer to the elevators , then to the dining room , then to the table that was reserved in his name . Junior cleared his throat and said , " Thank you for coming . I appreciate your taking the time from your busy schedule to have lunch with me . " <p> The judge did n't reply . <p> That bothered Junior and made him stumble over his next sentence . " I ... uh ... I ... I want ... I would like to  --  " <p> " I presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that correct ? " <p> " Yes sir . " <p> " How old are you ? " <p> " Twenty-eight . " <p> " Carrie just turned nineteen . " <p> " Yes sir . I know , sir . " <p> " She 's very young . " <p> " Yes sir . She is , sir . " <p> There was a pause in the conversation while the two told the waiter what they wanted to eat . Art Deco did n't like either the tenor of the short conversation so far or the judge 's tone of voice . He quickly concluded Judge Vandeveer would not give him permission to marry his daughter Carrie and immediately lost his appetite . But he ordered anyway . <p> When the waiter had gone , Judge Vandeveer continued . " What do you do , Deco ? " <p> " Right now ? I 'm looking for a  --  " <p> " What have you done before now ? " <p> " I graduated Harvard Law School . " <p> " Then what ? " <p> " I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schatzberg , Downey , and Pels , " said the judge . <p> " That 's right , sir . " <p> " But you left the firm , did you not ? " <p> " Yes sir , I did . " <p> " What do you intend to do with yourself now ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , sir . " <p> " Not a good enough answer . What makes you think you cansupport my daughter , unemployed as you are and without any definiteplans for the future ? " <p> " I have a substantial trust fund . " <p> " A trust fund that is at the whim of your father . Is that correct ? " <p> " Yes sir . How do you know , sir ? " <p> " I have my sources . Actually , Deco , your trust funds and your future are of little concern to me . What is of great concern to me is my daughter 's education . Carrie is very young , Deco . I want her to complete her medical education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . I would have preferred if my daughter had matriculated at my alma mater , the University of South Carolina , where I went to school , but my daughter has a mind of her own . " <p> Junior thought of how Carrie persisted in calling him Arthur , not Art . <p> " I am not entirely unhappy that Carrie has chosen Columbia , " said the judge . " They do have an excellent medical school , and many excellent hospitals to choose from here in the city . In any case , I will see to it that Carrie finishes her four years at Columbia , her four years of medical school and one year of internship in general surgery , and then at least six years of neurosurgical training . If Carrie wants to specialize in , say , endoscopic removal of brain tumors , she may opt to take a few more years within the specialty . " <p> " That 's ... that could be sixteen years from now ... sir . " <p> " Correct . " <p> " But could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Out of the question . I do not want my daughter to be distracted by marital problems . I want her mind clear so that she can learn how to be a good surgeon . " <p> Art Deco was devastated . He practically whispered , " Does she want  --  " <p> " It does n't matter what she wants , Mr. Deco . It only matters what I want . I want my daughter to be a doctor . That is something she has always wanted to be , and I have always wanted her to be . I will not have Carrie distracted from her objective . I want her to finish her residency before she even thinks about a man in her life . I have a suggestion , Deco . " <p> " Sir ? " <p> " Forget about marrying my daughter . In fact , I will inform my daughter that you are off limits as far as she 's concerned , until Carrie 's finished her training . " <p> Suddenly Art was angry . He gathered up his courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can do whatever she wants , Judge Vandeveer . " <p> " She most certainly can , Mr. Deco , " said the judge , cold as ice , " but I very much doubt if she will defy her father . " <p> Junior 's short , happy life was over and lunch had n't even been served . <p> Copyright 2009 by Chuck Barris <br> Library of Congress subject headings for this publication : <br> Adult children  --  Crimes against  --  Fiction . <br> Rich people  --  Fiction . <br> Kentucky  --  Fiction . <br>
