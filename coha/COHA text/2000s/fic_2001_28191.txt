HE STANDS UP NEXT TO THE girl 's body . He looks down at it for a moment , then carefully steps over the narrow boards lying around it . He walks across the grass and joins the three men , waiting like mourners . No one speaks . The body is poised like a still life waiting for a painter . Now they watch the photographer edge his way over the boards , his equipment balanced on one shoulder . He stops and gently lowers the legs of the tripod into place , then steadies the bulky camera directly above the girl . Without looking up , he snaps his fingers . The men silently move aside , shifting their lanterns as a boy passes between them , moving with a sleepwalker 's strangely certain gait , eyes fixed on the frail pyramid of white powder he carries on a tray . The boy stands by the photographer , nervously waiting while he adjusts the dials on the camera . The photographer ignores him . He hunches behind the camera and pulls a black cloth over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightens around the dead girl 's mouth . The photographer mutters something unintelligible , then his hand blindly works its way out from under the cloth . The instant his fingers snap , the boy strikes a match and holds it to the powder on the tray . A blinding flash lays transparent white light over the girl 's body , her stiff arms and legs , the folds of her dress , transforming her into something eerily poised , a statue fallen on the grass . There 's shadow , a black space carved under her neck , in the angle where her head is bent toward her shoulder , and below one outstretched arm . Her other arm hides her face . The light vanishes , leaving a cloud ofodor . Burned sulphur . The Inspector keeps this harsh image of the girl 's sprawled figure in mind even later , after her body is cut open , becoming curiously tender and liquid . She lies in the Volksgarten , near a seated stone figure of the Kaiserin Elizabeth . The statue faces a fountain pool in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a curved wall of bushes nearly twelve feet high . The park is a short distance from Spittelberg , Vienna 's notorious district where the Beiseln offer music , drink , and women . The Inspector points at a crumpled piece of white paper or cloth near the girl 's body . Two of the policemen nod and begin to pick up the boards . There 's no haste in their movements , even though it 's getting late . They set a board on top of two rocks to make a walkway over to the cloth . If there are footprints on the ground , the boards will protect them . During another investigation last year , the spring of 1910 , the Inspector temporarily preserved footprints in the snow at a crime scene by placing a flowerpot over each one . There are other ways to keep prints in sand , soft dirt , or dust . While the photographer 's boy patiently holds a lantern over his head , the Inspector squats on the boards , close enough to see that the cloth has been roughly smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flies around it and a sweet , foul odor . He takes tweezers from a leather pouch and pinches a corner of the fabric . It sticks slightly . When he pulls it off , the fabric has a dark smear on the underside , and he has a shock of recognition as he drops it inside an envelope . Someone has murdered a young woman and defecated next to her body . When the Inspector stands up , he realizes he is sweating . His shirt is damp ; his suspenders are wet stripes over his shoulders . The humid night air has also weighed the girl 's clothes down over her body . It is hot , unusually hot for the end of August . They prepare to take another picture . Egon , the photographer , drags the tripod over to the dead girl . He sets it up and cranks the camera down and down , stopping it two feet above the soft excrement . One of the men raises a lantern over it so he can see to focus . The Inspector steps back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lightning powder as it ignites . In a minute , the lantern 's light is eclipsed by the explosion . Days later , when he looks at the photograph , the grass around the body appears as stiff as if it had been frozen , not burned into the glass plate in the camera by the explosion of light . When the boards are removed , the girl looks frailer alone on the ground . They find no objects , no other obvious clues around her . The thick grass masks any footprints . They 'll search the area again tomorrow during the day , when there 's better light . Invisible in the dark , the Inspector stands on the marble platform next to the Kaiserin Elizabeth 's statue . He 's a tall man and can reach nearly as high as her head . He gently touches the statue 's shoulder . He never would have permitted himself this trespass at any other time , but he 's unsettled by the extraordinary discovery of the girl 's body near the memorial . Wife of Franz Josef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a madman with a blade so wickedly thin it left only a speck of blood on her chemise . It is said her dying words were " At last . " He wonders if there is some connection between the statue and the location of the girl 's body . In front of him , the men move quietly in the circle of light made by the lanterns , and between their dark figures , he can glimpse the whiter shape of the girl . Just beyond the park , the wing of the Imperial Palace is faintly visible . From behind the trees , there 's occasional , isolated sound of an unseen carriage proceeding around the Ringstrasse . According to police routine , a sketch is always made before a description of the crime scene is written . Closely trailed by the boy holding the lantern , Egon paces out a rough square around the girl 's body , three hundred and sixty paces , and transfers this measurement onto a graph , drawing the kaiserin 's monument as a dash , the sign used on survey maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushes the end of a tape measure into the ground at the crown of her head and measures one and a half meters to the base of the monument . Her right arm is bent over her dark face , so he unspools the tape from her shoulder at the same point . A distance of almost two meters . Finally , he pulls the tape from the left heel of her white canvas boot over to the path , just over one meter . When the sketch is finished , he signs and dates the paper . Now her body has been remade as the center point on a graph . Lines radiate from her head , arms , and legs as if she were a starfish or a sundial , pinning her exactly in this place at this hour . Before the dead girl is moved , the Inspector gently removed her pearl earrings . He cuts through the strap of her watch , uncoils it from her wrist , and seals the objects in an isinglass envelope . He asks for more light , and now with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weight , balancing himself on one hand . Careful no to touch her , he uses the point of the scissors to delicately manipulate her thin cotton dress . Occasionally he asks for a magnifying glass . His eyes filled with the harsh white of her dressa dazzling fieldhe forgets the body under the fabric until he accidentally sets his hand on her bare arm . Although he instantly jerks it away , the impression of her cool skin stays on the palm of his hand , as if he 'd touched a liquid . He rubs his hand against his trousers . He knows the other men noticed his spontaneous reaction . He forces himself to touch her again , to break the spell , pushing her thumb down hard against the ground . It 's slightly stiff , and he estimates she 'd been dead at least four hours . The heat makes it hard to calculate , although rigor mortis affects the small muscles first . He discovers a pale hair under the collar of her dress , and his assistant , Franz , wordlessly holds out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found on her clothing . However , the back of her white dress is stained when they lift her off the ground . When they flop her onto a stretcher , Egon vomits . The other men look away . The Inspector also ignores him , but he understands his distress . It 's the movement of the body that sickened him , its parody of motion . He orders one of the policemen to stay at the site for the few hours remaining until daybreak . As soon as it is light , Franz goes over the kaiserin 's monument , checking for fingerprints . First he dusts the statue with powdered carmine applied with a fine camel-hair brush . The second time he uses charcoal dust . The same fingerprint powder is also applied to the ornamental urns and the marble gate posts at the entrance of the Volksgarten . Franz reports that all the stone is to rough to hold any impressions . The afternoon of the same day , the girl 's body is in the morgue at the police station on the Schottenring . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of decay and formalin . The ceiling fan cools the room , but it also sucks up the odor of the cigarettes they exhale over the metal table where she lies . They work in the body 's stink as if it were a shadow . Franz takes scissors in slow strokes down the sides of her dress and across her shoulders , then lifts it off . He cuts the thick canvas corset from her waist with a heavy knife after slashing through the laces . It probably took her longer to get into the corset , he jokes to the man leaning across the table , a doctor in a white jacket . The older man is as blond as Franz , but his hair is thinning . His pink head hovers over the girl 's discolored face . The doctor nods without looking up . I think she 's about eighteen years old , he says . The bare room does n't hold conversation well . Her clothing is dissected , the labels removed . Everything was purchased at good Brger shops , Farnhammer , Maison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unidentified girl is now naked , her head propped up on a wooden block . Her eyes are flat and bloodshot , and her tongue partially protrudes between her lips . The upper part of her chest is the same livid color as her face , and darker blotches stripe the sides of her red neck . The underside of her body is a blurry-edged patchwork of stains . Uncirculated blood has seeped from the veins and settled here , sagging under its own weight , ripening into a deep violet and green of decaying flesh . Over her body , a mirror-lined lamp shade reflects these colors in its distorted curve , an obscene chandelier . " She 's been strangled ? " Franz asks . The doctor nods . The Inspector walks in and stands at the opposite end of the table . He imagines the girl 's body is carved from stone and he looks down on it from a great height . This exercise helps him think about her without emotion . He watches the doctor wrap a cloth around her head and under her jaw to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you fix her skin ? " he asks . " I can bleach it . Remove her hair , make cuts on the back and sides of the skull and leave it in running water for twelve hours . That will lighten the greenish color . " The Inspector tells him to wait . There must be a less drastic way to make her body presentable . He anticipates a mother or fatheror perhaps a close relative , since the dead girl wears no wedding ringwill come to identify her . Later , the Inspector and Franz smoke cigarettes in the hallway . " Thirty years ago , when I was an assistant policeman , I had to take care of the head of a corpse on my own , " the Inspector says . " There was a murder in a remote village , and no refrigeration or ice was available . I put the head in a perforated box and set it in a stream . But first I covered the head with a net to protect it from fish . " Alone in the morgue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dead girl 's stomach , fiercely slopping liquid into a metal basin . A few rooms away , Egon dips his sketches of the Volksgarten and the girl 's body into a pan filled with a solution of stearine and collodion . The paper will dry in fifteen minutes without changing color . The solution protects it from moisture and the dirty hands of the witnesses and jurymen who will handle the papers in court . Later that day , Egon returns to the Volksgarten . The area he paced off is surrounded by stakes linked with string . The excrement next to the body has been scraped up and replaced by a rock with a number painted on it . The policeman on duty nods at Egon and idly watches him unpack his equipment . The young man works quickly , with the skilled sleight of hand that comes with long practice . He takes out a small wooden box , a device called a Dikatopter . He does n't trust technical devices , although he sometimes straps a pedometer on his boot to measure the distances he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to the stakes , looking into a black mirror inside the open lid of the Dikacopter . Fine threads are pulled through holes in the mirror , dividing it into fifteen squares . Holding the box in front of him , he moves forward a half step at a time , watching until the path and the Kaiserin 's monument are visible in the web of threads , so he can calculate the position of the girl 's body against these landmarks . He 's pleased with his work , the fugitive images captured in the box like butterflies . In the bottom of the box , there is a paper divided into a graph identical to the one on the mirror . He draws an outline of the girl 's body on the paper from memory , and the monument and the path exactly as they are reflected in the mirror above his hand in the lid . Light shines through the holes in the dark , and the pencilled outline of the body is suspended below these bright dots , as if it had been connected into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night the girl 's body was discovered . He stayed at the police station , and went home the following evening . The first time he describes the girl 's body , his wife , Erszbet , creates her own image of it . She imagines the men standing around the body as if it were a bonfire , a radiant white pyre , its light shining through their legs as if they were alabaster columns in a temple . The dead girl fallen inside their circle . Erszbet asks the girl 's name and age . " She 's unidentified . The doctor guesses she 's about eighteen . " " Why was she is the Volksgarten ? " " That is the mystery . " " She must have been from Spittelberg . Why else would girl be in the park at night ? " " She may have been killed earlier in the evening . Judging by her clothing . I believe she 's from a good family . Her murder would seem to be a misadventure of a crime passionnel . " " Have you discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods and does n't question him further . She 's satisfied with his limited information since it allows her to create her own theories . The girl 's body punched a hole in the safe space that was the park . Two days after the body is discovered , the Inspector talks about the girl during dinner , although it is n't his custom to mention the dead at the table . He asks Erszbet to come to his office tomorrow and bring her paints . This is the first time he 's asked her to help him in this way . That night , when Erszbet ca n't sleep , she thinks of the nameless girl , who has died , whose face she will paint tomorrow . In Hungary , there 's a custom of dressing unmarried young women and girls in white for their funerals , as death tranforms them into brides of heaven . The deceased girl is given away by her parents with the same words as a wedding ceremony . Tomorrow , she 'll silently recite an old verse over the dead girl 's unclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black . When I 'm dead , I 'll walk in white . Franz walks in front of Erszbet down the hallway in the police building . He lets her enter the morgue ahead of him . The girl 's body is on the table , a cloth covering everything except her head . Her face is still blotchy , the skin as dull and opaque as beeswax , and her eyes have sunk into their sockets . The cloth around her chin has been removed , and her mouth is slightly open . Her long pale hair is tied back with a piece of string . It seems that all the cold in the room presses down against the still face , bitterly sculpting her profile , making it sharper than it had been in life . For a moment , the total passivity of the body seems peculiar to Erszbet , until she remembers the girl is dead . That 's all Erszbet notices before she turns and presses a handkerchief to her nose . Later , the odor in the room will sometimes return to her , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she prepared for painting by heavily dousing herself with perfume , touching the bottle 's glass stopper to her wrists and the fleshy nape of her neck . Her hair is secured in its upswept coil with extra pins . Now she strokes red , yellow , and brown pigments into a thick smear of white lead paint on her palette until it turns a pale flesh color . Venetian pink . She adds linseed oil and soap so it will adhere better to the cold surface of the girl 's skin . She asks Franz to loosen the cloth from around the girl 's neck . First she paints the darkest part of her face , around the mouth and nostrils , stopping her hand just before she blends the paint into the dead face with her finger . She 's been working on the body for nearly an hour when a man walks in carrying a bowl filled with a white paste . He casually sets the bowl down on the girl 's stomach . Remembering Erszbet is in the room , he courteously moves it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished ? " She nods and steps aside . He begins to vigorously knead the thick mixture in the bowl . " This is my own modeling formula . Ten parts white wax and two parts Venetian turpentine melted together . I add potato starch to make it sticky . " " What are you going to do with it ? " " You could say I re-create the crime in a positive fashion . I can make what 's absent . Someone shoots a gun into a wall , my modeling wax goes in the hole . Then I pull out an impression of the bullet 's passage . " She asks if the same technique works for bodies . " Yes , but I use cigarette papers . When they 're wet , they 're so fine they pick up the smallest impression , even a knife scratch on the skin . To fill deeper holes , like stab wounds , I glue something slightly heavier on top of the cigarette papers . Toilet paper works best . " He digs around under the cloth and pulls out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tightly clenched , a small incision had been made at the base of each finger to loosen it for fingerprinting . Now he easily bends back a damaged finger , sticks a little ball of wax over the cold fingertip , and begins to work it down . " I 've made waxes of ear wounds , missing teeth . Even the stump of a tongue that had been bitten off . Mice love this mixture . I keep my wax models inside a glass cabinet to keep them from being eaten . " He curls his hand around the girl 's finger to warm it , then continues to pinch the soft wax up to her second joint . Erszbet is unable to move away or even avert her eyes . She stares at his hands , engaged in their task as routinely as if he were writing a letter . " Why are you copying her fingers ? " " I 'm not making a copy . First I cleaned under her nails with a bit of paper . The wax just picks up anything left under there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing but their own skin . Dried blood , if the victim fought their attacker . I suspect that 's what I 'll find here , since she probably struggled to pry the murderer 's hands off . See , she has scratches down both sides of her neck . " His fingers press the wax too firmly and it bulges over the girl 's knuckle . Finished with her hands , he sticks a finger into her mouth , careful not to disturb the paint on her lips . With his other hand , he delicately presses a wad of wax over her teeth . Erszbet did n't realize she 'd made any gesture , but suddenly Franz is next to her , guiding her into the next room . The light wavers , and there 's a round buzzing pressure in her head just before she abruptly sits down . Egon quickly moves his equipment into the morgue to photograph the girl . Someone draped fabric over the block and the metal table to disguise it , and he calculates how the lens of his camera can disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's cabinet , objects as mysterious and dumb as fossils , reverse images of damage done to a body . There 's a delicate X shape , molded from a double knife wound in a man 's chest . A whitish tube , thick as a finger , cast from the passage made by a bullet into someone 's back . A rough , V-shaped wedge documents a stick 's impact in the muscles of an arm . These are the soft interiors of bodies turned inside out , turned solid . She 's familiar with the wax charms and effigies that work magic at a distance . Gypsies twist wax or unfermented , uncooked dough into tiny fingers and stamp them with incomprehensible markings , aids made to win love or wreak revenge , for good or ill . To make the spell more powerful , nail parings , pubic hair , menstrual blood , urine , and perspiration are kneaded into soft wax . At one time , the lives of the French kings had been endangered by these vols models . In Germany , Atzmann figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a child , she remembers a girl burned a scrap of her own dress , which was saturated with her sweat . The ashes were secretly fed to a boy whose love she had hoped to win . Erszbet knew the boy . When he unknowingly ate the ashes , she watched his face convulse with astonishment and disgust as he realized what had been done to him , what was the bitter taste in his mouth .
