<p> Dr. Panyiotis Zavos likes to tell people how he honed his English by watching television commercials . When he was looking for a motto for his human cloning group , the Cyprus native borrowed a motto from an old restaurant ad : " We 'll do it right , or we wo n't do it . " <p> But on his corporate Web site , where the background depicts robot-like hands grasping sperm cells by their tails , bright red letters spell out a different slogan : " Being first is what it 's all about ! " <p> The Kentucky-based animal reproduction specialist and human infertility guru is the most visible member of an international team seeking to become the first to clone a human being . <p> But some scientists - noting Zavos ' firing from a hospital for alleged unethical behavior and accusations that he flouts the rules when it suits him - question whether he should be leading mankind into this brave new world . <p> " I consider him to be a heretic from my field , " says Dr. Erica Behnke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those who favor human cloning question Zavos ' involvement . <p> Dr. Michael Vernon , a fertility expert and former colleague of Zavos ' , foresees human babies born with " a permanent deformity or a lethal problem , where they 'll just live for a couple of days and die . " He says cloning humans at this time would be " unethical and immoral . <p> " I 'm very pro-cloning , when the time is right . It 's not now - and definitely not him . " <p> In animal experiments , many clones have died before birth and others have been born with abnormalities . Even Ian Wilmut , the Scottish scientist who introduced Dolly the cloned sheep to the world , has said cloning humans today " would be extremely irresponsible . " <p> Zavos clearly relishes the challenge of proving his critics wrong . He appears convinced that this is the time , and that he is the man . <p> " It happens to be just me against the world , " he said . <p> The 57-year-old Zavos burst onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend , Dr. Severino Antinori , an Italian reproductive specialist , in an effort to clone a human by 2003 . <p> Zavos sees cloning as a means of allowing infertile men to have children . The self-styled clinical " cowboy " has said he would be the cloning team 's " referee , " reviewing research data and recommending when it is safe to move from animal to human cloning . <p> But what qualifies this medical researcher , who spent much of his early career in livestock sex selection , to make such decisions ? Who is Panyiotis Zavos ? <p> The handsome doctor with his jet-black hair and ubiquitous white lab coat presents himself as sort of a Mediterranean Horatio Alger , who as a young boy sold oranges on the streets of Tricomo , Cyprus , to help support his poor family . His illiterate mother , Theodora , was pregnant 26 times , but only eight of those children reached adulthood . <p> Zavos , the first person in his family to earn a college degree , emigrated to the United States in 1966 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kansas because his mentor and future father-in-law , Charles Simkins , formerly of the U.S. Agency for International Development , had family in the area to provide a safety net . <p> It is in Emporia that he is most fondly remembered . <p> To help pay his way , Zavos got a job working at a dairy . Jim Harter , his roommate for two years , says Zavos would get up at 3 a.m. , ride his bicycle 5 miles to the dairy , do the milking , mucking and feeding , then be back in time for 7 a.m. classes . <p> Friends at Emporia State affectionately called Zavos " Panic " - a nickname that was both easier to say than Panyiotis and descriptive of his frenetic pace . <p> Ed Rowe , one of his professors at Emporia State , remembers Zavos correcting him on the Greek roots of scientific terms . When Zavos needed equipment to study cooling effects on young mammals , he modified a refrigerator with Plexiglas and tubes . <p> " He just did n't let things stand in his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1969 , Zavos married Simkins ' daughter , Mary Susan . ( They divorced in 1991 ) He stayed on at Emporia State for another seven years , receiving bachelor 's and master 's degrees in biology-chemistry and biology-physiology . <p> In 1978 , he received a Ph.D . from the University of Minnesota . His dissertation : " The effects of supercooling by the use of emulsions on the fertility of turkey spermatozoa . " <p> Dr. Alan G. Hunter , a member of the graduate committee that reviewed Zavos ' work , remembers Zavos as having " an entrepreneur spirit . <p> " He looked beyond the pure science to some of the applications , more than some of the other graduate students . " <p> That entrepreneurial spirit has brought Zavos both fame and trouble . <p> In 1979 , Zavos landed a professorship in animal science at the University of Kentucky . Five years later , he became a contract employee at Lexington 's Central Baptist Hospital performing andrology services , preparing sperm samples for analysis in infertility cases . <p> Zavos ' problems began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working with couples using surrogate mothers , which was against the hospital 's policies . <p> Vernon , who had taken over the hospital 's fertility services the year before and now runs a fertility lab in Baton Rouge , La. , says an employee came to him with allegations that Zavos was billing certain patients exorbitant fees for work performed at Central Baptist , but keeping the money himself . <p> A February 1994 hospital memorandum informed workers that Zavos had been fired " for unethical and illegal behavior " and told them to call security if he appeared at the office . <p> Zavos has said the hospital saw his outside business ventures as competition and seized the first excuse to fire him . <p> In June 1994 , Zavos ' Andrology Institute of Lexington was cited by the state for failing to properly label regulated waste , sperm . Zavos had the employee who made the complaint arrested for harassment , then sued her . <p> A judge threw out the criminal charge , calling Zavos ' actions " vindictive . " A countersuit filed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That same year , Zavos was brought before the university 's institutional review board on allegations that he had supplied semen samples for a federally funded HIV study without seeking approval and proper patient consent . Zavos said he was unaware that he needed the approval , and the board warned him that his research would be subject to " unlimited , unannounced inspections . " <p> Dr. Tim Smith , a former UK colleague , says Zavos had gained a reputation as someone who " enjoys the smell of gunpowder and the fray of battle . " Smith says he was " recruited " by Zavos for some commercial and scientific projects but politely turned them down . <p> " You know , if you lay down with dogs , you wake up with fleas , " says Smith , currently director of an in vitro fertilization lab in New Jersey . <p> Besides another mild admonishment in 1996 for failing to submit a paper for review , Zavos remained in good standing at UK until earlier this year . Shortly after his involvement in the cloning effort became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining the title of professor emeritus . <p> According to a settlement agreement dated Feb. 13 , Zavos retired in exchange for a $60,000 lump sum payment and nearly $6,000 in vacation pay . The reasons behind the retirement were not directly addressed . <p> " My life is too colorful for the university to handle , " he said at the time , " so we have severed our relationship . " <p> However , in a letter obtained under the Kentucky Open Records Act , Dean C. Oran Little of the College of Agriculture told Zavos he had been accused of " neglect of or refusal to perform duties as a faculty member " - one of three grounds for firing a tenured professor . <p> Among people listed on Zavos ' Web site as co-authors with him on scientific papers is Dr. Grace Centola , a past president of the Society for Male Reproduction and Urology . But she says Zavos made her list him as a co-author simply because she used some of his equipment in her research . <p> " There was one time he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing any research that we could do together ? " ' says Centola , who now runs an andrology lab in New York . " And I wanted to say , ' Whoa ! What ? Am I doing any research that he can have his name on the paper ? ' People do n't do that , you know ? " <p> That practice is apparently more common abroad , Centola says . <p> Dr. Ronald Ericsson , who sued Zavos in 1993 for patent infringement but eventually dropped the action , says cloning is inevitable . But he 'd like to see it done by someone he respects . <p> " He did n't get my respect , because I do n't think his motives are pure , " says Ericsson , the man credited with the first separation of X and Y sperm cells . " I think he 's doing it strictly for the dollars . " <p> Zavos told the Dayton ( Ohio ) Daily News recently that he was " not forcing this on society . Society has asked me to do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark compared to what we do . " He says his team will use a " grading system like the USDA inspects beef steak , " and that only the most viable embryos will be brought to term . <p> " Even if they look normal , we transfer only the U.S. Marines and Navy Seals , " he said . " That 's the best embryo we can transfer . " <p> Regardless of his motives , Zavos has done well for himself . <p> He lives in a 10,000-square-foot house and has several luxury cars . He recently boasted that he gets more for a single speaking engagement than he made in a month at UK . <p> When The Associated Press first approached Zavos about doing a profile , he quickly agreed , blocking out an hour of time . <p> In the meantime , he suggested a look at his Web site , which catalogs his many published articles , his numerous commercial endeavors ( such as SpermRus , an " online " semen analysis service ) and his varied titles , including associate director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm in this world to inspire , help people and then leave , " he says over the telephone . " And so I 'm a very positive guy . <p> " My cup is always half full , if not all full . But it 's never half empty . " <p> But when Zavos learns from a former professor that one of the people interviewed for this story had referred to Zavos as a " cow doctor , " he abruptly cancels the interview . He says he can tell the article is " twisting " in a way he does n't like . <p> " This cow doctor , " he says , " is not going to talk to you , OK ?
