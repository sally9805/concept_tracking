<p> The Semai people of Malaysia never fight . <p> Whenever two tribe members have a conflict , it is resolved with words - lots of them . <p> The village leader calls a meeting to discuss the dispute . Anyone with an opinion can speak up . <p> And they do . The meetings can go on for days . Redundancy is a given . <p> When the talking finally stops , the village leader makes a ruling . Then he orders everyone present never to speak of the dispute again , and that is the end of it . <p> It is no secret that the vast majority of the world 's societies are nothing like the peaceful Semai . But why ? <p> Why do people split into groups with deadly intent ? Why does it happen at particular moments in history ? And what are the roots of the concept of warfare ? In the past few years , researchers in several fields have been exploring these questions with growing vigor . <p> " It 's a contribution that archaeology has to make to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Croatia , in Ireland and in all the rest of those places , " said archaeologist Jonathan Haas of Chicago 's Field Museum of Natural History . <p> Haas spoke at a recent meeting of the Society for American Archaeology , where some members argued that war is about 10,000 years old . If that is true , then war is probably a social invention analogous to agriculture , cities and political states . <p> But others contend that war is much older , maybe even millions of years old . If war goes so far back , it must be a much more basic element of human nature , like language or tool-making - a trait that everyone naturally acquires even with minimal encouragement . <p> Until about a decade ago , many scholars dismissed primitive warfare as nonexistent or , at the most , inconsequential . Warfare was thought to be primarily a tool of political states bent on territorial control and expansion . <p> Any evidence for war that did appear in the absence of centralized government was compared to the head-butting contests of rutting elk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ritual competition that almost never escalated to lethal combat . <p> Some archaeologists were so convinced by this explanation that for years they ignored obvious signs of warfare at ancient sites . <p> Recently , archaeologists interested in war have excavated hilltop forts in the Andes that were built centuries before the Inca empire swept out of a small valley to conquer the region . On the South Pacific island of Palau , they have mapped fortified hilltops and villages built 1,000 years before Europeans arrived . In the U.S. Southwest , they have found numerous Anasazi skeletons with bashed skulls , broken bones and other obvious evidence pointing to a violent end . <p> But determining that war occurred among people untouched by modern civilization does not settle the question of when , where and how it began . <p> Nearly every primitive society ever studied fought wars . To those who believe war is a fundamental part of human experience , that means the concept must have developed more than 10,000 years ago . If war is common among people who live as humans did before 10,000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common practice back then . <p> Yet anthropologists have found a handful of cultures , such as the Semai , that never fight wars . That does n't mean they are n't violent - in fact , some have strikingly high homicide rates . But these cultures never organize themselves into groups to violently settle disputes . <p> In his 2000 book " Warless Societies and the Origin of War , " University of Michigan anthropologist Raymond Kelly argues that these cultures have one thing in common : They do not consider belonging to a group an essential part of individual identity . <p> They have no clans , no classes , no chiefs . People from these cultures would have a hard time understanding school spirit , party loyalty or national pride . <p> Kelly believes that before about 20,000 years ago , all cultures lacked the concept of group identity . In such a world , he argues , war would be impossible . It was only after people started settling down between 20,000 years ago and 10,000 years ago that their societies grew stable enough to develop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every scholar of ancient war agrees that the earliest archaeological evidence for organized violence lies in the Nile valley of southern Egypt . The site , known as Jebel Sahaba , is one of the oldest cemeteries known . <p> The people buried at Jebel Sahaba were laid to rest between 12,000 and 14,000 years ago , after stressful lives wracked by periodic famine . The Ice Age was jerking to a close then , causing periodic droughts that created the Sahara Desert and dried up the Nile . <p> Nearly half of the 59 skeletons archaeologists uncovered at Jebel Sahaba had stone points either lying amid the bones or embedded in them . Some of them contained many more stone points than it would take to kill a person , as if the attackers had brutally " pincushioned " the bodies of their victims . Many of the children had points embedded at the same place in the backs of their necks , as if they had been executed . <p> But it appears to be an isolated case , because the next oldest evidence of war does n't appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites in Iraq dating back 10,000 years have found defensive walls , projectile points and mace heads . Many experts consider maces - spiked clubs - a dead giveaway for war , because arrowheads , spear points and axes could always have had non-combat uses . Walls could have been for flood control or corralling animals . But maces are n't good for much besides bashing heads . <p> Other early signs of war include the 9,500-year-old walls of Jericho , the famous walled city whose conquest is described in the Old Testament . <p> Some archaeologists have argued that Jericho 's walls were really for flood control , not defense . But there is little doubt about Catal Huyuk , an early agricultural settlement in Turkey occupied about 8,000 years ago . The houses are packed together like New York City apartment buildings , with entrances on their roofs that would have made Catal Huyuk a tough town to ransack . <p> By 6,000 years ago , there were indisputable signs of war across Europe and in many other regions as well . In Spain , dramatic cave paintings depict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that once prehistoric war began in a region , it came and went with natural cycles of feast and famine . Recent research shows that before Europeans arrived in North America , repeated and prolonged droughts sparked hostilities in a number of regions . <p> But during times of plenty , war could disappear for decades or centuries . Eastern North America experienced a prolonged peace beginning about A.D. 1 , when the regional food supply increased due to the widespread adoption of maize and bean cultivation . <p> Brian Ferguson , an anthropologist at the Newark , N.J. , campus of Rutgers University , interprets this record as an indication that war was invented independently in many areas - but nowhere much more than 10,000 years ago . He believes that during prolonged periods of drought or other ecological catastrophes , a previously peaceful species turned to war as a means of wresting precious resources from their neighbors . <p> But Lawrence Keeley , an archaeologist at the University of Illinois in Chicago , takes a different view of the same evidence . He has argued that war occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it because of what he calls " a problem of archaeological visibility . " <p> Before 10,000 years ago , Keeley pointed out , people were nomadic and did not live in permanent settlements . They had no reason to build fortifications around villages that they were just going to abandon in a few weeks . <p> Being constantly on the move meant they did n't have cemeteries either - so archaeologists have few examples of human remains to examine for signs of violent death . <p> Without such evidence , there is little means of proving the existence of war . But when the evidence does appear at places such as Jebel Sahaba and Catal Huyuk , Keeley argues , war looks like it has been going on for a long time . <p> Keeley 's account fits well with recent observations of warfare among chimpanzees . <p> It is possible that man and ape came to war independently . But because chimpanzees are by far the closest living relatives to humans , some researchers believe a common ancestor of the two species invented war more than 5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior that grows out of hunting , " Keeley said . <p> But the antiquity of war does n't make it genetic , said Steven LeBlanc , an anthropologist at Harvard University . It just means that the evolutionary pressures human ancestors experienced millions of years ago were already pushing them toward war . <p> " There 's nothing built-in , " LeBlanc said . " It 's situational . And we 've been in that situation for most of human history . "
