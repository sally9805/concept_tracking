In a place of worship , four people are caught in separate shafts of light . The light comes on as each one begins to speak , then stays on as the others speak . Each one speaks to the light as if it were God . A WOMAN SofinallyI 'm in love . A MAN SoI 'll always love him . ANOTHER WOMAN So ? I 'm still in love with the son-of-a-bitch . ANOTHER MAN So , of course I still love him . A WOMAN He has blondish hair  --  what 's left of it . And a bald spot suitable for kissing . A MAN He has brownish hair  --  what 's left of it . And a bald spot suitable for licking . ANOTHER WOMAN He has black hair and a hardass heart let me tell you . ANOTHER MAN He has my same mouth and nose and looks just like me when he smiles . ( As A WOMAN continues , the others are lost in thought and prayer . ) A WOMAN There 's too much hair on his back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too much and too little of something or other . His eyes are blue  --  not scary shark blue , but azure like the sky  --  like the sky on a good day . His fingers are long and good for giving people the finger  --  not that he does  --  he would n't , I mean , not so they could see him do it anyway . He 's what we used to call a pushover  --  now we 'd say a wuss or a pussy . And what 's that about ? ! Pussies are good things  --  as far as I 'm concerned anyway . I know I like and admire my own . But it 's no good without the proper stroking . The cajoling of my inner thighs is simple for the loved one to master . The object of my desire has a really goofy laugh . I think it must be genetic . A midwestern " I find really stupid things funny " kind of laugh . A laugh that 's not afraid to be laughed at . A laugh that registers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have walked through cemetaries together , admiring the flowers which grow wild over the most forgotten graves . I will write him a beautiful eulogy  --  because girls always live longer than boys . So I 'm told . p. 3 A MAN He has so much hair on his legs and inner things . I have a made a porridge of his fluids on that nest of his hair . And boy do I have a thirst for his breakfast cereal . It is composed of tears and pain . But I 'm strong for him . He knows this so he tortures me . He sends me away from him when he needs me the most . " Get used it " , he whispers . " Get used to life without me . " But I do n't want to . I still smell him on me wherever I go . I have n't washed my pillowcases in six months because he lingers there like a new scent by Nina Ricci  --  too many flowers and not enough herbs . In its faintness , it grows sweeter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of how soon he will leave me . I ask for just one thing . He wants to leave me his collection of North African pop on vinyl . He thinks I crave the exotic . I just crave him . A hand in mine , a head on my shoulder , a walk to the toilet in the middle of the night because he ca n't hold it in anymore . " You do n't have to hold it in around me , baby . I love every bit you . " This he will not believe . He is embarrassed by his own weakness as I could never be . This he can not believe . So he sends me away . ANOTHER WOMAN He 's killed eighteen people . He said he kilt them because they were white and whites do n't have no feelings  --  not like the rest of us . I think he had to kill the thing he most wanned to be . And anyway , he was killing himself the whole time same as them . I do n't shoot up anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it for him and with him . And now he 's alone in there . I know he 's dying in prison because I 'm dying out here and that 's how it works . I tried to see him , got as far as the bus . Turned around . I 'm too ugly anymore for anybody to love me . My daughter , Lizzie , says I got number eleven legs because they so skinny , like sticks . I used to be fine . We loved to go out dancing  --  all dressed and looking sharp . But then the killing started and I could n't go there with him . I had Lizzie to keep those bad things out of my mind . I could still see the good in people with Lizzie to show me how . He never liked her  --  from the day she was born all he wanted was for her to be quiet . I think it 's because she reminded him of good things too . Things he thought he did n't deserve to feel . That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does . I hope I do n't go before him . I do n't got nobody to care for Lizzie . But I 'm looking . So maybe I 'll find somebody soon . p. 4 ANOTHER MAN What 's that stupid social worker think ? That a man do n't love his brother just because he 's dying . I ca n't help it that I ca n't see him . I do n't want to remember a crazy faggot in a bed hooked up to a machine . Do n't get me wrong  --  I mean he 's not a real faggot , that 's just a figure of speech . Sure he used drugs , but that 's all . He got hooked in the army when he was in Germany . They give you drugs to stay in the army . That 's what he told me anyway . People assume you 're a faggot because you got it but that 's not the truth  --  not in this case . I just wanted to be clear on that with you . Anyway , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls with . The guy I took trick or treating . He always wanted to be a ghost . I made him all his costumes . One Halloween we got a real good onewhen our sister Wandi got her period and we used her sheet  --  boy , we grossed a lot of people out that year . It was a good year . And I hate to say it but I guess he got his wish now , huh ? That 's like a joke but it 's not a joke because I bet he looks dead already  --  and why would I need to see that ? I know he does n't want me to see him like that . She said he 's been asking for me , but I say she 's lying . How can somebody who 's already dead ask for anything ? She just thinks a family member or some shit needs to be there to see him die . I do n't got ta see that because I see it already in my head . So what would you do ? p. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to declare myself to him . He 's stopped drinking so I know he can hear me now . I heard him all those times he declared himself to me in his drunkeness . He 'd grab for a body part and say he could hold me so good like nobody else ever could . But I did n't believe it coming out of those vodka scented lips that have kissed more mouths than I could count  --  more moustaches too . That 's the sad part . ANOTHER WOMAN I 'm gon na go see him next week . It 's my birthday present to myself . Might be a good time  --  might be the only time . But I do n't know , he 's jus'gonna look at me and scream . I 've never looked so bad that a little make-up did n't help . But make-up just ai n't working no more . I keep smearing my lipstick when I cough and then I look like a clown . Lizzie tells me that too . " Ma , you 're looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as good as Bozo these days A MAN I 'm going to go and buy myself some new pillowcases . The ones with his smell on them , I 'll sew them up at the end like a secret and put them inside my new cases and I 'll sleep there on them and only I will know what 's on the inside . ANOTHER MAN I 'm just not going to go . That 's why I came here . I wanned to explain myself to someone who 'd listen . ( The lights begin to fade slowly. ) p. 6 ALL FOUR Hey , do n't go . ( The lights stay on at their lower level . ) ANOTHER MAN Are you mad at me now ? I 'm just being honest . Men should n't see other men looking weak . Brings the strong ones down . Let the girsl go see that  --  they like to cry . I got no use for that . He 'd feel the same about me . I would n't want him anywhere near me . A MAN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to give him a kiss but he turned away from me and started coughing . I think it was on purpose . He thought I 'd get all grossed out by his mucus and blood , but I just wished I could suck it all out of him and make him better . I would do anything to kiss him . I kept trying but he kept coughing and motioned me out the door . I rested my lips on the other side of that door and left a kiss for him anyway . In my head I see him kissing me back . ANOTHER WOMAN You think they let people on death row get kissed by other people ? I 'd have to kiss him if I got in to see him but I bet I 'd have to kiss him through plastic or somefin . Oh , it 's okay to kiss . My doctor tole me it 's okay with Lizzie and everyfin . I would die if I could n't kiss her . Right now , right here , I would jus'die . A WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's all . Then I could die happy . I know it 's four minutes because I practiced with his picture and that 's how long I could keep his face in my head without opening my eyes . Four minutes in heaven . The only thing is he wo n't let me kiss him , because he thinks he 's diseased  --  but that 's not how you get it , right ? By kissing ? I know you do n't get it like that . But still he wo n't let me. p. 7 ANOTHER MAN I think about his hands sometimes . They were so delicate . I would tease him about those hands all the time . Sweet , faggoty hands . And then I 'd chase him and kiss those hands if I caught him . I 'd kiss them now if I could . He knows I would if I could . But I ca n't ALL FOUR Sowhat 's a kiss ? ( The lights fade slowly out. )              @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
