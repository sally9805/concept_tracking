When Pemberton returned to the North Carolina mountains after three months in Boston settling his father 's estate , among those waiting on the train platform was a young woman pregnant with Pemberton 's child . She was accompanied by her father , who carried beneath his shabby frock coat a bowie knife sharpened with great attentiveness earlier that morning so it would plunge as deep as possible into Pemberton 's heart . <p> The conductor shouted " Waynesville " as the train shuddered to a halt . Pemberton looked out the window and saw his partners on the platform , both dressed in suits to meet his bride of two days , an unexpected bonus from his time in Boston . Buchanan , ever the dandy , had waxed his mustache and oiled his hair . His polished bluchers gleamed , the white cotton dress shirt fresh-pressed . Wilkie wore a gray fedora , as he often did to protect his bald pate from the sun . A Princeton Phi Beta Kappa key glinted on the older man 's watch fob , a blue silk handkerchief tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell of his watch and found the train on time to the exact minute . He turned to his bride , who 'd been napping . Serena 's dreams had been especially troubling last night . Twice he 'd been waked by her thrashing , her fierce latching onto him until she 'd fallen back asleep . He kissed her lightly on the lips and she awoke . <p> " Not the best place for a honeymoon . " <p> " It suits us well enough , " Serena said , leaning into his shoulder . " We 're here together , which is all that matters . " <p> Pemberton inhaled the bright aroma of Tre Jur talcum and remembered how he 'd not just smelled but tasted its vividness on her skin earlier that morning . A porter strolled up the aisle , whistling a song Pemberton did n't recognize . His gaze returned to the window . <p> Next to the ticket booth Harmon and his daughter waited , Harmon slouching against the chestnut board wall . It struck Pemberton that males in these mountains rarely stood upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever possible . If none was available they squatted , buttocks against the backs of their heels . Harmon held a pint jar in his hand , what remained of its contents barely covering the bottom . The daughter sat on the bench , her posture upright to better reveal her condition . Pemberton could not recall her first name . He was n't surprised to see them or that the girl was with child . His child , Pemberton had learned the night before Pemberton and Serena left Boston . Abe Harmon is down here saying he has business to settle with you , business about his daughter , Buchanan had said when he called . It could be just drunken bluster , but I thought you ought to know . <p> " Our welcoming party includes some of the locals , " Pemberton said to his bride . <p> " As we were led to expect , " Serena said . <p> She placed her right hand on his wrist for a moment , and Pemberton felt the calluses on her upper palm , the plain gold wedding band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like his in every detail except width . Pemberton stood and retrieved two grips from the overhead compartment . He handed them to the porter , who stepped back and followed as Pemberton led his bride down the aisle and the steps to the platform . There was a gap of two feet between the steel and wood . Serena did not reach for his hand as she stepped onto the planks . <p> Buchanan caught Pemberton 's eye first , gave him a warning nod toward Harmon and his daughter before acknowledging Serena with a stiff formal bow . Wilkie took off his fedora . At five-nine , Serena stood taller than either man , but Pemberton knew other aspects of Serena 's appearance helped foster Buchanan and Wilkie 's obvious surprise  --  pants and boots instead of a dress and cloche hat , sun-bronzed skin that belied Serena 's social class , lips and cheeks untinted by rouge , hair blonde and thick but cut short in a bob , distinctly feminine yet also austere . <p> Serena went up to the older man and held out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice her age , Wilkie stared at Serena like a smitten schoolboy , the fedora pressed against his sternum as if to conceal a heart already captured . <p> " Wilkie , I assume . " <p> " Yes , yes , I am , " Wilkie stammered . <p> " Serena Pemberton , " she said , her hand still extended . <p> Wilkie fumbled with his hat a moment before freeing his right hand and shaking Serena 's . <p> " And Buchanan , " Serena said , turning to the other partner . " Correct ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> Buchanan took her proffered hand and cupped it awkwardly in his . <p> Serena smiled . " Do n't you know how to properly shake hands , Mr. Buchanan ? " <p> Pemberton watched with amusement as Buchanan corrected his grip , quickly withdrew his hand . In the year that Boston Lumber Company had operated in these mountains , Buchanan 's wife had come only once , arriving in a pink taffeta gown that was soiled before she 'd crossed Waynesville 's one street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night and left on the morning train . Now Buchanan and his wife met once a month for a weekend in Richmond , as far south as Mrs. Buchanan would travel . Wilkie 's wife had never left Boston . <p> Pemberton 's partners appeared incapable of further speech . Their eyes shifted to the leather chaps Serena wore , the beige oxford shirt and black jodhpurs . Serena 's proper diction and erect carriage confirmed that she 'd attended finishing school in New En-gland , as had their wives . But Serena had been born in Colorado and lived there until sixteen , child of a timber man who 'd taught his daughter to shake hands firmly and look men in the eye as well as ride and shoot . She 'd come east only after her parents ' deaths . <p> The porter laid the grips on the platform and walked back toward the baggage car that held Serena 's Saratoga trunk and Pemberton 's smaller steamer trunk . <p> " I assume Campbell got the Arabian to camp , " Pemberton said . <p> " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughn . That horse is n't just big but quite spirited , ' cut proud ' as they say . " <p> <br> Continues ...
