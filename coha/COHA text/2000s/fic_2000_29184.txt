Feast or famine . My plate is suddenly full . One day my Bliss is in Iowa , studying dentistry , gazing at the gums and decay of hog farmers and their kin . She claims she can eyeball a patient 's teeth and see through to what 's rotten . And now she 's coming home for a quick visit , a thousand miles , without even the excuse of a national holiday or school calendar break . " Do n't you have teeth to clean ? " I asked hopefully when she called with the news . At my insistence we use long-distance sparingly , only when something truly important comes up . Since I 'm still up in the air about our future as a couple , why throw away good money until I 'm sure about what I 'm doing : it 's the difference between carnations for her birthday and a cashmere sweater . I have us writing postcards back and forth . Short and sweet , public enough so things can never get too involved or serious . A picture 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture : I am twenty-six years old , and was recently anointed the new resident chef at the Richfield Ladies ' Club in Richfield , Connecticut . I make lunch and tea , and in the evenings I 'm on my own . A few weeks back , an old classmate at the CIA ( that 's the Culinary Institute of America ) , Jim King , now pastry chef for one of the Kennedy widows , and hating it , told an acquaintance of his who had just started her course work at the Yale Graduate School of Design to call me if she ever wanted a great home-cooked meal . Her name is Lisa Lee , and as she put it when she phoned andinvited herself to dinner , " Sterling Lung , King says you 're fabulous . He said I 'd like you even if you could n't cook . " I was flattered , of course , but as soon as we hung up , I felt crowded by her presumptions , as I do whenever some know-it-all enters my kitchen and counsels me on ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , more pepper , or once even more cardamom . To my credit , I did try to discourage her with the warning that New Haven is clear across the state , a solid two-and-a-half-hour drive away . " How can that be ? " she said . " We 're in the same area code . " I could n't imagine what Jim King might have told her ; Lisa Lee was undaunted . " I 'm sure you 'll make the drive worthwhile . " In bed that night I puzzled over the phone call . Why had Lisa Lee been put up to this ? I tried to contact Jim King , but was unsuccessful ; the alumni office at the CIA would n't divulge his exact whereabouts , a condition of his employment . I mulled over the facts , scarce as they were . Finally I decided : Jim King must have a stake in this , he must be in pursuit of this Lisa Lee and is simply using me as bait . My role is that of a culinary Cupid . Fair enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have King set me up with a Kennedy . I was so pleased with my revelation that I bounced out of bed and wrote to Bliss . On the back of a John and Yoko postcard ( it 's their wedding day ) , I should 've known better , but I spilled the beans . I put it all down , except the bit about King and the debt he 'll repay with a Kennedy . I 'm innocent ; totally up-front , right ? But honesty is n't enough for Bliss . She 'll never admit it , but some corn-yellow tooth is going to go unpulled because she 's jealous , in love , and coming east to protect what she believes is hers . So it goes , the laden table , the overflowing cup . I 'm talking to Fuchs , the butcher I buy from . " How about a nice capon ? " Fuchs says . He has muttonchop sideburns and a nose with hairs like alfalfa sprouts . I grimace ; with his talk of capons , Fuchs suddenly assumes a sinister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serving castrated rooster is n't my bag . All I want is a four- , four-and-a-half-pounder , a biggish bird so Lisa Lee wo n't think I 'm going cheap on her . Fuchs tears off a square of orange butcher paper , which he lays on the scale , then plops the bird on top . " Fresh , " he says . " Be my guest , take a whiff . Fuchs wo n't steer you wrong . Pound for pound , you ca n't buy better than this . " Cool refrigerated air rises off the dank yellow skin . " I 'm surprised at you , Fuchs . I would think you 'd be more sympathetic to his plight , " I say , fingering the ex-rooster . " Why ? Because I 'm a member of the tribe ? Because I was circumcised ? " " No . Because you have one to circumcise . " I poke the bird . " Us guys have got to stick together , Fuchs . Think about it : Snip ! And as if that 's not bad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump , big and fat , and he struts around like cocks do , big man in barnyard , only the hens are snickering behind his back . Think how he must 've felt . " " Sterling , what gives ? Since when did you become psychologist to the poultry world ? " He wraps the capon , ties the bundle with brown twine . " Hey , speaking of snip , how about what's-her-name , the one they let play against the ladies at the U.S. Open last year . Whatever happened to heror should I say him ' ? " Renee Richards , tennis pro , who in a recent former life was Richard Raskind , medical doctor . I remember the first time I saw her in the newspaper , she was in her tennis whites , in one of those ridiculously skimpy skirts female players wear in order to show off their panties . I was immediately drawn to her looks , found her rather sexy even , that is , until I read the accompanying article detailing her surgical transformation . " Ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What kind of man are you ? " A woman enters the store . A young housewife dressed in an outfit ; her shoes , belt , and lipstick match . Fuchs snaps back to his business mode : " So how many of these capons would you like , sir ? I guarantee you , the ladies at the club will adore this flesh . " The new customer is browsing the beef-pork-lamb end of the refrigerated case . I look at her , then at Fuchs , who rolls his eyes and whispers , " That one was never a doctor . " I nod ; he 's got that right ! " That 's it for today , " I say . " Hey , these birds are meaty , " Fuchs says , " but just one wo n't feed that crowd at the club . " " It 's not for the ladies . " I laugh nervously . " I have this art student from Yale , a total stranger , coming for dinner . A friend of a friend , that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you say . At least she 's smart . " " How do you know she 's a she ? " " Because a guy gets hamburger . She , " he indicates the housewife , with a tip of his head , " gets the bird . " " You 're right , she 's a she . Lisa Lee . " " Chinese too , Sterling ! Better than good . " I stare at Fuchs as though he were a freak , natural or manmade , himself a capon . " Why 're you looking at me like Madame Chiang Kai-shek just burst from my forehead ? " I shake the shock from my eyes . " I never imagined she might be Chinese . " " Madame Chiang ? " " No , Lisa Lee . " The other customer sets her purse on top of the meat case . To her Fuchs says , " I 'm almost through here , miss . " To me he says , " Lee 's a Chinese name . Am I right ? " " Sure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sara Lee . " " And do n't forget Richard Day-lee and F. Lee Bay-lee . " " Be serious . " " And there 's that jujitsu guyBruce Lee . " Fuchs scratches his bald spot . " Geez , when you think of it , hardly anyone 's Chinese . " I hand over some money . Fuchs offers to charge the purchase to the Ladies ' Club account . " Personal use . " " Boy , you Chinese are honest , " Fuchs says . " Well , I wish I was in your shoes , having a blind date like that . " He winks , and at that moment , as half his face collapses , I see him as a man from an earlier time in human history , someone who could effortlessly tilt back the chin of a lamb and slash its throat . Leaving the store , I hear Fuchs say to his customer , " So , I see you like looking at meat " I walk to the Ladies ' Club with the capon bundle under my arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he does all day , he sees things . Lisa Lee is Chinese , which explains why Jim King has put her up to our meeting ; he thinks we 'll make a cute couple together , a pair of matching bookends . I try to imagine Lisa Lee and immediately conjure up my sisters . I see them , one after the other , their faces like post office mug shots , and under their chins , instead of a serial number , is a plaque that reads " Lisa Lee . " I know it 's wrongheaded , even a bit spooky , and entirely indicative of bad wiring inside me , but in my heart every Chinese woman registers as an aunt , my mother , my sisters , or the Hong Kong girl whose picture my mother keeps taped to the kitchen mirror . They hold no romantic interest for me . I pass Kim the greengrocer . People in town think he is Chinese . I backtrack , enter the store . Lisa Lee : bean sprouts , snow peas . I rarely do business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cut me a break , ripping me off , his Asian brother , along with everyone else . Six bucks a pound for snow peas ! Kim 's making a mint and getting fat , even his wire-rims look fat . And he speaks only enough English to kiss up to the housewives with his " America is good place , " " You look nice , " " Cheap , cheap " stuff . With me , he does n't botherwhat is another Oriental going to get him ? I pay , and feel pickpocketed . My own money , and what 's it going to get me ? " Not so cheap , " I say to Kim , with a smile , angling for a discount . But he just eyes me , a stray that 's wandered in off the street . " You not have to buy , " he says , and shrugs . Normally I have no use for bean sprouts and snow peas , even at half the price . They are not part of who I am as a chef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milkshake a drinking straw , a dinner guest named Lisa Lee requires the appropriate vegetable matter . " Blind date , " I say , holding my purchases up by my ear . I can see from Kim 's blank expression that he has failed to grasp my meaning : he ca n't see that my hands are tied , that I must go against the grain , that under routine circumstances I would n't tolerate this economic exploitation . Kim says , " America is land of plenty . Why you want a blind girl for ? " When I get homethat is , the small apartment that comes with the job , four hundred square feet , the top floor of the carriage house in the rear of the Ladies ' Club propertyI find a postcard from Bliss in the mail . A giant ear of corn that takes up the entire length of a flatbed truck . She alternates between sending the mutant-corn postcard and sending the one of the colossal hog with antelope horns . She writes : " A guy comes in complaining about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The X rays do n't know any better , and neither do my professors . But then I had a hunch , this feeling ; I borrowed a light and checked his eyes and his ears . And bingo ! There was a moth in there and a foot of yarn ! When it was all over , Moth Ears asked me out for a beer . He said , Are you spoken for ? ' I had never heard it put that way . Sterling , have you spoken for me ? I love you . See you Friday , the 16th . " I check the calendar . Today is Friday , the fifteenth . Is she coming today , or tomorrow , the sixteenth ? Friday , as she says , or Saturday ? Something 's wrong . As much as I hate having to do so , I have to phone her , paying premium daytime rates , no less . When she does n't answer , I 'm relieved , spared the toll chargesthough I know that 's an inappropriate response . She 's probably already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I try Lisa Lee 's number ; she is n't at home either . Perhaps both are speeding , in opposite directionsLisa Lee from the east , Bliss from the westto the same trembling destination . I rinse the bird , salt its body cavity , and curse Fuchs . Before Fuchs , Lisa Lee was just a hungry student coming for a home-cooked meal ; a stranger shows up uninvited at your door , you feed him . Or her . There 's a right and a wrong , and I was prepared to do the right thing . In the end even Bliss would n't have objected to that . But talking to Fuchs has put me in a fix . Now my innocent little dinner , my mission of mercy , has transformed into a date . With a Chinese girl , of all things ! Bliss and I had been seeing each other on a regular basis for only a few months when she asked me to move with her to Iowa and set up house . I told her no , I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of her second year of dental school and stay with me . Fearing the escalation in the level of our commitment to each other such a sacrifice would signify , I had to tell her no again . I was flattered , but was even more bewildered by her eagerness to alter her plans . In my eyes we were , at best , a fringe couple . Yes , we were going out . Sleeping together . I was happy to have her in my life . I was new in town , knocking myself out trying to impress my employers , and if I 'd been living close to friends , in familiar surroundings , I might not have indulged the relationship as I did . We were pals , we hung out , we ate lots of food , we drank good wine , we had sex occasionally . But moving in together , in the Midwest ? Was she kidding ? That was far beyond where I was . The trouble then , as now , was that I never meant for things to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior high schooler : I liked her but I did n't love her . I towel off the capon , massage mustard onto its skin . It feels no different from any of the hundreds of chickens I 've cooked , but I ca n't get used to touching this thing . Bliss would have no qualms ; after all , she wants to drill teeth for a living . Nothing seems to bother her . When she wedged her way into my life , arriving unannounced like an angel with a pot of soup , I was sick , a vibrating mass of germs , but she laid on her hands and helped me undress and made my bed and massaged my back and sat nearby , singing French folk songs and Joni Mitchell . I could n't sleep because of the singing but was too polite , indeed , too beholden , indeed , too afraid to ask her to cut short her concertthat was what it was , for she seemed to pause between songs for imaginary applause . The moment came when I dislodged my arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my hip , cutting wide arcs that I hoped would alert her to the fact I was still awake and miserable , bored , and ready for surrender . On one of these sweeps she grabbed my handlater she would argue I had offered it to herand when my arm pendulumed up toward my head , she leapt out of her chair like a fish from the sea . Without the slightest break in her song she was lured into my bedso goes her version of how we ended up making love that first time . As we lay naked between the sheets , chills from the fever stiffening my body , she held me to her enormous heat and asked if she might come again , another day , with more soup , and unsteadily , I said , " Yes . " I admit I was the one who had made first contact . Soon after I arrived in Richfield , I saw her name in our college alumni magazine and called her . We had been marginal friends at Swarthmore , both art history majors , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we traveled in different social circles ( her group was acid and orgies ; mine was wine and one-night stands ) . After running hard with the " in crowd " her first four semesters , she turned serious as a junior , finding peace in the study of Gothic cathedrals . At the art history majors ' costume party during her Senior Week , we spoke for the first time . She went as Notre Dame , a dishwasher box , with splendidly painted details of the original and posterboard flying buttresses hanging off at her sides like spider legs ; her face was that of a gargoyle . Guys joked about coming to worship , going on a pilgrimage . I went as Warhol 's Brillo box . Our costumes were huge hits but left us on the sidelines , victims of our own geniuswhat a drag trying to boogie with your body in a cardboard box . When I tracked her down at her parents ' place in New Canaan , she was completely surprised . We met for lunch on one of my first off-days from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippie she 'd been in school . While her long , frizzy brown hair was still her most distinguishing attribute , in the four years since I had last seen her she had lost the roundness in her face and had traded in her T-shirts and Indian print skirts for tailored clothing . Between graduation and dental school , she had worked for her father , who owned and managed properties and acquired things . Even though she slept under his roof and received a salary from him , she seemed to harbor boundless hostility toward her father . In her lingo , he was " capitalist pig scum , " who apparently felt morally justified in his own brand of bigotry because his parents were Holocaust survivors . After the initial weekend lunches at local restaurants , I invited her to my apartment for dinner . Then came the day she showed up at my door with the soup . I rub the mustard onto the capon 's skin , with its largish pores and nipple-like bumps ; the mustard 's whole seeds , tiny orbs rolling between my palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The telephone rings and I jump , embarrassed by the pleasure I 'm taking . My mind leaps from the capon to Lisa Lee . She must be calling to cancel our date ; perhaps she has a project due and ca n't come to dinner . But the instant I lift the receiver I realize I do n't want to hear that message at all . " I 'm here ! I 'm here , I 'm here , I 'm here ! " It 's Bliss . Originally , she explains , she planned to fly in tomorrow , but a classmate , Ray , has a wedding to attend in Greenwich , and she caught a ride , saving money , his drive-buddy . At this moment they are outside Syracuse , still hours shy of Connecticut . " I 'm skipping my parents , " she says . She sounds all juiced up , still speedy from the road . " It 's a hit-and-run visit . I 'm not even stopping in , they 'll want to feed me , take me shopping , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with you . " Love is a lot like cooking . When either is successful , there 's a delicate chemistry in operation , a fine balance between the constituent parts . If you have the perfect recipe for vichyssoise , you do n't monkey with it . We 've had a workable arrangement . The U.S. Postal Service has kept us connected ; we have a standing agreement to take holidays together . That 's plenty . Why spoil a good thing ? " We 're going to stop by Randazzo 's , " Bliss says . " Come join us . I 'm letting Ray buy me drinks . " She informs me that Ray is a third-year dental student ; he has been " a good help " to her , and twice has taken her hunting for ring-necked pheasant in the harvested cornfields . " I 'm stuck here , " I tell her . " I 'm experimenting with a new recipe . " Which is the truth . " Always other women , " she says . I hear the sarcasm in her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed , but suspect she also means Lisa Lee . For a moment I consider putting an end to the intrigue , inviting her and that guy Ray to join us for dinner . A foursome around the table . Me and Bliss . Ray and Lisa Lee . At the mere thought of such a pairing I experience a biting pang of jealousy . " Silvy , what 's the matter ? " she says , into the silent line . " It 's me , Bliss . Are you upset with me ? Cominto our vision of perfection . This discounts our children 's own natures and passions , decisions and wisdom . It leaves little room for them to become the artists of their own soulsa right they are inherently born to . The creative work of our own souls must not be confused with creatively raising children , or raising creative children . For if we are led to believe that our children must become our creative work , then we must also believe that when our children grow up and leave us , our creativity leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forsaken to even imagine . In order to sustain ourselves on the Big Purple Mommy journey , we must hold our children in one hand and our creative gifts in the other , palms open and uplifted , recognizing that each hand holds something of immense , indescribable value , knowing that each hand tends the other , and that the weight in each hand will shift and change every day of our lives . Most importantly , both hands , while separate , extend from our two arms , which are connected to our body , which house our heart and soul . To Contemplate Do you have any visual reminders of yourself doing your creative work or expressing your creative self ? A photograph , or a drawing , perhaps ? If not , think about asking your partner , friend , or child to take/ make one of you . Display it in a prominent space and make a point of looking at it several times a dayespecially when you 're most feeling like " just a mom . " Close your eyes and think about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your creative work . Is the weight in one hand different from the other ? How long has it felt like that ? What possibilities exist for lightening the weight in that heavier ( To be continued )
