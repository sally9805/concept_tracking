Chapter One Candice Alone , Candice sat in Jada 's guest bedroom by the large bay window , enjoying the second-floor view . Inside the cozy space , a plush queen-size bed with a red satin button-hole headboard rested catty-corner facing the door . The sparkling fuchsia duvet adorned a dozen tasseled pillows . A pink leather bench perched adjacent to the footboard . The glass-top computer desk faced outside , snug beneath the redwood window frame . Candice 's fingers skated along the keyboard , sixty , seventy words a minute : I had a dilemma many married women shared : Should I divorce my impotent husband or not ? I 'd instantly trade in a broken car I could n't fix or sell a run-down house that cost more to maintain than its value . My husband was n't a thing ; he was a human being . A cheating man , who 'd fucked around for over twenty years , with the same woman . Candice paused , gazing at the rolling green hillside resembling the peaks and valleys of their friendship . Jada was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . They 'd partied together , laughed , cried , double-dated . Met their husbands the same night at Cityscape in San Francisco at a Will Downing , Rachelle Farrell concert . That was BM , before marriage , those were the good old days . Jada met Wellington . Candice met Terrell.Wellington fucked up , Jada married Lawrence . Terrell fucked up , Candice married Terrell . They both relocated from Oakland to L.A but not together . Jada moved to get away from Wellington . Candice would 've moved anywhere in the world to be with Terrell , who lived in Los Angeles . Terrell was five years younger , an international model , and , so she 'd thought , wealthy until she married him , realizing Terrell lived well above his means . He owned a huge house with a waterfall , bought her an expensive wedding ring . The first sign of financial trouble was when Terrell purchased matching his-and-hers Mercedes Benzes , with her money . Accepting Terrell 's ring , Candice felt obligated to get married . What if she did n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candice had remained single , and Jada had gotten married , they would n't have stayed friends . Not close friends . Assuming their wives were n't intelligent enough to think , insecure married men objected to their spouses kickin ' it with single girlfriends . A selfish man could ruin a good friendship . Hoping she and her girl would stay close , Candice said , " I do , " shortly after Jada called off her engagement to Wellington . The main thing Candice tried to avoid happened . Thanks to Terrell 's controlling ways , Candice lost touch with her best friend . For years . Without a friend and time on her hands , Candice wrote and sold a screenplay about Jada 's life . Putting Jada 's business on the big screen got Candice a not so warming house visit . After Jada got over being pissed , they were friends again . How long would their friendship last this time , considering Candice was temporarily living in Jada 's house , secretly writing part two of Jada 's life ? Tapping the keys , Candice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid in his office drawer were n't used for my womanly pleasure . He 'd found the sexual stamina to stick his dick in another woman , but he could n't , or would n't , make love to me . He was eager to sign the divorce papers until the doctor told him his prostate cancer had spread and they had to operate immediately . What 's my obligation to stay with a two-timer ? I 'm clear . I have none . But I do have a conscience . I wo n't leave him while he 's down , but after the surgery , she can have him . Candice sighed . " This is too boring . I'ma have to throw in some cussing to sell this one . Let 's see , " she said , backspacing , then revising : That muthafucka emptied a twenty-you hear me ? -a twenty-count of Viagra on that stank-ass bitch . If his sorry ass was n't dying I swear I 'd kill that dead-dick bastard ! Twice ! Anger was better , Candice thought , mesmerized by the fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another on her charm bracelet dangling from her wrist . The ten years she was married to Lawrence , Wellington was in the background . Once Jada married Wellington , Lawrence disappeared and Darryl bopped side to side , doo-wopping as backup , waiting to sing lead in her chorus . One man at a time was Candice 's style . Terrell was n't that bad in the beginning . They 'd still be married if she 'd been woman enough not to let him change her . Candice never found peace with wanting but not having a child . Terrell did n't want kids . Too late now , premenopause and a baby who 'd stare at her for crying , yelling , snapping , swearing , and forgetting things would drive Candice crazy . Not so long ago , Candice remembered her husband was her life . In many ways , having Terrell was like having a child and an overprotective father . At first marriage was kinda cute , him telling her what to do . That chauvinistic shit got real old , really quick , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another with misery . Candice thought when , he left her , she 'd fall apart . Wrong . She did n't lift him up to put herself down . Surprisingly the second his shadow walked out the door , the sun seemed brighter . So was her spirit . Like before she 'd gotten married , Candice felt stress-free . The days of him telling her how to dress , " Cover your breasts . Take off that skirt . You 're not leaving this house looking like that , " were gone . Like what ? A sexy male magnet ? The way she used to dress when he met her , wearing a peach minidress . But he could bare his masculine chest or muscular thighs whenever he desired , saying , " You know , baby , it 's different for a man . " And he had no problem being admired by women . Because of her , he 'd made a great career move after their divorce that guaranteed him access to more pussy than he could eat . Terrell went from modeling to acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a supporting role in Soul Mates Dissipate . Candice was happy for her ex , happier for herself . Thankful that over the years she 'd respected her body by exercising , eating healthy foods , sleeping six to eight hours a day . She 'd aged gracefully . Single , available , with no intentions of remarrying , she knew she was sexy and thanks to her girlfriend 's never-a-boring-moment life , she had an eight-figure bank account and the waterfall house to cushion her divorce . Nice landing . Tap , tap . The finger mouse centered on the dash . Click . The screen faded to black . Candice minimized her document , closed the laptop , picked up The Guide to Becoming a Sensuous Black Woman by Miss T , then answered , " Come , in . " Peeping her head through the door , Jada asked , " What are you doing ? " " Just reading this book on how to seduce a man . Nothing you 'd be interested in , " Candice said , parting the pages . Smiling , Jada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptop . Glancing at the book , Jada said , " You right . I need one on how to unseduce your husband . Do you mind going to the store ? Wellington wants some more snacks . " Candice stood . " Sit down for a while . " Massaging Jada 's neck and shoulders , Candice said , " You are tense . " Jada rotated her head , neck , and shoulders . " Um , that feels so good . Thanks , girl . " " How 's he doing ? " Candice asked , not giving a damn because Wellington 's sorry ass did n't want Jada to leave his side for more than five minutes at a time . Candice gave up on investing her energy into finding a faithful man who was honest , considerate , loving , good-looking , and wealthy . If a man had three good qualities , she 'd take him for what he was worth . How long he stayed with her depended upon when or if he became useless . Candice pressed her thumbs into Jada 's muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lot of pain . I 'm glad he 's checking into the hospital soon , because he 's wearing me out and not the way I 'd like . All he wants to do is watch television , kiss me to death , and rub on my titties like he 's doing something . " " Like this , " Candice said , groping her hands on Jada 's shoulders . Laughing , Jada said , " Exactly . He works me all up for nothing because he does n't want to lick my pussy , and I 'm tired of playing with her to entertain him . Girlfriend , I 'm too young for this sexual frustration . There 's nothing wrong with my pussy . " Candice thought , First it was beer , now snacks . Could n't he make a list ? replying , " You know how I feel . Get some dick lined up on the side . You 'll be well within your right , and ai n't shit he can do from a hospital bed . " Standing , Jada said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't cheat on my husband for the sake of having sex . I have to love the man I 'm with . " " You 're delirious . That 's why I 'm here . For you . " To write all this shit down so next time Jada got a man , probably Darryl , she would n't forget . Jada lived a fairy-tale kind of life , suppressing reality to suit her beliefs . Jada could watch her screwed-up life on the big screen and think it was somebody else 's , claiming , " I could never do ... " Candice continued , " Whatever you need me to do , just tell me . And I want you to know , being here has helped me get over Terrell , " she lied , then told the truth , " and I am going to help you get over Wellington . " Candice had emotionally divorced Terrell years before he 'd left . Shaking her head , Jada said , " I should n't complain . I 'm not trying to get over Wellington . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candice tried to get Jada to leave Wellington , Jada defended Wellington every single time . " I should stop off at Darius 's house and see if any wedding gifts arrived . They may be sitting outside . " " Huh , what ? Oh yeah . Good idea . The keys are on the key rack in the kitchen . " " If Wellington thinks of anything else , call me , girl . " Candice supported Jada , not Wellington , and no matter how many errands Wellington sent her on , she 'd go , and she 'd return . At least he could n't accuse her of cock-blocking . Waiting for Jada to leave , then watching her walk away in Betty Boop pj 's with red eyes that were half closed , Candice wondered , why had her girlfriend stayed with Wellington after his affair ? Closing the bedroom door , Candice input the information Jada had given her . " Oh , " Jada said , reentering the room , " I almost forgot . Darius is on his way home so you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't knock . Next time Candice had to lock the door . The hell I do n't , Candice thought . Darius 's life was ten times more exciting than Jada 's , and this might be her only opportunity to have access to his dirt . Quickly saving the new chapter before removing her memory stick , Candice powered off her laptop , slipped into a pink sweatsuit , laced her tennis shoes , then skipped out the front door jiggling Darius 's keys . One press of a button on her remote and the engine of her red-hot convertible Benz roared . Candice sped to the neighborhood grocery store , tossed chips , pretzels , peanuts , cashews , beef jerky , Snickers bars , and red vines in the handbasket . " That 'll do . " Waiting in the " ten items or less " checkout line , Candice tapped her foot , sighed ; as she shifted the basket to the opposite hip her toes froze in midair . A KEYS MADE sign was near the entrance . Leaving the junk food on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darius 's keys to the tall , bald-headed man , and said , " One set please . Make that two . " Spiraling her copies on her chain , Candice said , " Keep the change . " Speeding to a nearby shopping center , she stood outside the electronics store and dialed Jada 's number . Jada answered , " You still at the store ? " " What does he want now ? " " Ice cream . Strawberry . " Along with the junk food she 'd forgotten to pay for . " Girl , if I did n't love you ... I 'll pick it up later . " " I 'm sorry , you called me , " Jada said , yawning . " I have to make a stop , but I 'll get back ASAP , " Candice said , hanging up . Entering the crowded store , she approached the first blue-vested khaki-pants-wearing employee she saw . " Yes , I need ten , make that twenty , of those hidden clock cameras . And twenty one-gig memory cards . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned . " Is that part of your duties ? To get personal with me , young man ? " " Sorry , ma'am . I 'll bring ' em to the register for you . " " Now we 're communicating . And bring me two sets of binoculars . " Standing in line , Candice tapped her foot . Placing her items at the register , the employee said , " Have a nice day . " The cashier said , " I know you 'd like to protect your devices . I recommend purchasing our additional warranty- " " Stop wasting my time , " Candice replied , signing , then handing the white paper to the cashier . Candice snatched the bags , running like a linebacker to her car , then broke every residential speed limit for a five block radius to Darius 's house . Retrieving her keys , Candice entered Darius 's home , then secured the inside latch . Quickly she raced upstairs , hiding a camera in Darius 's closet , aiming the motion detector toward his bed . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Candice said , pressing the black dot . " Oh , shit ! " Three hidden doors opened at once . A black leather sex swing rocked , bright red lights beamed on a stage with a dance pole , white stars and a crescent moon danced on the ceiling as R. Kelly played in the background . Squinting and walking over to a cavelike opening in the headboard , Candice stared in disbelief . Adult toys : vibrators , butt plugs , pearls , lingerie , pasties . " Edible what ! Pia colada dickalicious , " she exhaled . " Let me get out of here . I see why women go crazy over his sexy ass . Hell , if he were n't my girlfriend 's son , I 'd wait right here to do him . Who would think of all this ? " R. Kelly switched to Luther right before a projector screen lowered from the ceiling , playing an X-rated video entitled Bootylicious . " No , he is not putting his big dick in her ... " Candice said , pressing the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sure of one thing , the best was yet to cum . Squinting , Candice moved closer , then stepped back , staring up at a red dot . " Oh , shit ! I 'm on his camera . " Now she 'd have to come back sooner than expected to find his recorder . Happy she had more material than she 'd originally imagined , she was worried Darius might expose her first . Swiftly planting cameras throughout the house , Candice noticed tiny red dots on every ceiling : the kitchen , living room , bathroom , garage , and five other rooms . The ten cameras she 'd left in her car she 'd place in Jada 's bedroom , living room , kitchen , bathroom , Wellington 's office , and a few other places . Soon , Candice Jordan-screenwriter , novelist , producer , and director-would become a household name . Like before , in time , Jada 's initial anger would subside . But if Darius found out , he 'd kill her . Chapter Two Darius " Los Angeles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flopped against the backseat , loosening his onyx wing-tip collar . Why had he fucked Ashlee ? Kimberly ? Crystal ? Desire ? Maxine ? Ciara ? The others were pissed at him , probably for life , but that was their problem ' cause each of them had moved on . Ashlee was the only dumb one who 'd gotten sprung on cum . Sure , he was thirty percent , give or take five , at fault , but he 'd grown tired of Ashlee . Holding her dangling curls away from her face , Fancy laid her cheek in his lap . Her lips kissed Slugger . " Ow , Ladycat , oh my goodness . " Darius 's dick expanded four times its size . " Heeyyy , this is a pleasant surprise , " Fancy said , nibbling his head . " I thought you were too upset to get excited . " " Shid , never that upset , " Darius said , nudging Fancy 's head closer to his dick . " Let me take your mind off your troubles . We can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacks . Translation , she 'd talk . He 'd listen ' cause whatever conclusion Fancy conjured would n't matter . She was a woman . He was the man . His castle . Her home . Maybe . If she 'd act right . Fancy unzipped his pants . Wrapping her hand around the shaft , she freed Slugger , letting him go . The tip of her tongue chased , steadied , then licked the underside protruding main vein right in the triangular groove below his pee-hole . Fancy licked his second hottest spot-next to the span from his asshole up to his balls-again . " Yes , indeed , there is a God . Ooouuu . " Darius shivered . Fancy cuddled his dick next to her cheek , closed her eyes , and sniffed . " Ahhhhh . " That 's my girl . Worship your master . (
