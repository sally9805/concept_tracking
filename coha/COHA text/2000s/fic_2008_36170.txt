The Italians called him the Greek . The Greeks called him the Sicilian . He was from Nicosia . It was a funny coincidence that the largest city in his native Cyprus shared a name with a city in Sicily  --  the birthplace of his bride . <p> " Sofia , " he whispered in the darkness . <p> His wife of eleven months lay sleeping beneath a clingy cotton sheet , the gentle curve of her hip a silhouette in the shadows of night . A late-summer heat wave had sent them to bed naked , and like true newlyweds , they 'd made the best of it . Cyprus was the mythological birthplace of Aphrodite , the goddess of love , who could n't have held a candle to Sofia . She was a classic Italian beauty , a strong and passionate woman with dark hair , captivating eyes , and flawless olive skin . The Greek felt lucky to have her , and he marveled that she loved him enough to leave her family and run all the way to Cyprus with him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sofia , did you hear that ? " <p> Her head did n't move from the pillow . <p> The Greek slowly slid out of bed , crossed the room in silence , and went to the open window . The lace curtains were motionless in the warm night air . He crooked his finger and parted the panels just enough to check the quiet street from his second-story apartment . <p> The cloak of night could hide centuries of decay , and Nicosia was beautiful in the moonlight . Flanked by the Pentadaktylos , the five-finger mountain , Nicosia was one of the oldest cities in the world , the geographic heart of an island paradise in the eastern Mediterranean . Behind thick sandstone walls , Cypriots had defended themselves from a host of invaders and occupiers dating back at least to the Byzantine Empire . The mid-twentieth century had proved to be another violent chapter , with five years of armed struggle finally bringing an end to more than eighty years of British rule . The Greek had taken no stake in that fight  --  which was why real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 'd grown accustomed to noisy nights , even gunshots . <p> It was purely instinct , but tonight the Greek felt another type of raid coming  --  one that had absolutely nothing to do with Greeks , Turks , or any of the country 's traditional ethnic divisions . He stood quietly at the lone window in their one-room apartment and listened . He was certain that he had heard something , and it took more than a cat on the roof to wake him from sleep after sex . <p> He walked around to the other side of the bed and sat on the edge of the lumpy mattress . <p> " Sofia , wake up . " <p> She grumbled and propped herself up on one elbow . Even at 3:00 A.M. she was beautiful , but she immediately sensed his concern . <p> " What is it ? " she said . <p> He did n't answer . He sat and listened for that noise again . There it was  --  a thumping that came from the first floor of their building . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sprang from the bed and quickly pulled on his underwear . <p> " Who 's coming ? " said Sofia . <p> He pulled on his pants . The thumping noise was louder , like a herd of stallions charging up the stairs . <p> " It 's me they want , not you . " <p> " Who ? Who ? " <p> " Listen to me . Do n't tell them I was here . Just say  --  tell them I left you . " <p> He kissed her before she could protest . <p> The loud bang on the door was definitely not a knock . Someone had put a shoulder into it . They were busting their way in . The Greek could n't find his shoes or his shirt , and there was no time to grab anything  --  except his gun in the top dresser drawer . He dived through the open window and out onto the balcony as the chain lock ripped from the frame and the apartment door crashed open . <p> He heard his wife scream . <p> " Sofia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give himself away . <p> " Out the window ! " a man yelled from inside the apartment . <p> The Greek could only run for it . He grabbed the rain gutter and pulled himself up to the second-story roof . His first step loosened an old barrel tile , and it crashed onto the street below . As he regained his footing , the Greek glanced back to see the lead man climbing up onto the roof behind him . <p> He was wearing a police uniform . <p> The Greek did n't hesitate to shoot , the sound of Sofia 's scream replaying in his mind . The return gunfire told him that he 'd missed  --  and the bullet ripped through his hand . He cried out in pain and dismay as his revolver flew from his grasp , slid down the roof , and landed in the gutter . Another shot shattered the clay roofing tiles at his feet . <p> The Greek kept running . <p> The slope of the roof changed from pitched to flat . He gained speed and jumped across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbor 's roof . A quick glance over his shoulder did n't slow him down a bit . Two  --  no , three  --  men in uniform were in pursuit . The Greek ran faster , his heart pounding in his chest . Beat after beat , the blood pumped from his wounded hand , leaving a crimson trail across the rooftops . He could n't stop running . At any moment , he expected a bullet in the back . They were close enough to take him out . <p> He leaped across another alley , and this time it took his breath away . The ground had gone from two stories to four stories below him . The buildings on his street had the same roofline , but they were built on the slope of a hill , each one of increasing height . <p> Too high to jump . <p> He raced across the rooftop , but the footfalls behind him grew louder . His hand did n't hurt  --  too much adrenaline to feel pain  --  but the loss of blood was making him dizzy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a safe place to jump down and hide . The roof pitched upward , however , and the only way down from here was through the men with the guns . He climbed even higher , all the way to the crest , where the roof flattened into a wide expanse . It was a big building , like a warehouse . No , a hotel . The Mykonos Hotel  --  the last building on the block . No rooftop beyond it . No more alleys to jump . <p> <br> Continues ...
