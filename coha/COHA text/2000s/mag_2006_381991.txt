At 5:15 on election night , Karl Rove sounded jovial , assuring Sean Hannity 's radio audience that Republicans would defy the polls and hang on to both the House and Senate . Less than three hours later , President George W. Bush was watching returns on TV in his private study with the First Lady and a few friends and aides . He leaned over as a blue riptide swamped Republican after Republican . " Looks like a rout ! " he said . <P> The architect  --  as Bush famously called Rove  --  of the 2000 , 2002 and 2004 G.O.P. wins now downplays his forecast . " My job is not to be a prognosticator , " he told TIME in an interview in his West Wing office . " I told the President , ' I do n't know where this is going to end up . But I see our way clear to Republican control . ' My job is not to go out there and wring my hands and say , ' We 're going to lose . ' " <P> Rove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative dissatisfaction with spending . He does not read the outcome as exclusively a judgment on either Iraq or Bush . " Iraq mattered , " Rove says . " But it was more frustration than it was an explicit call for withdrawal . " Which is not to say the White House did n't see trouble coming . To keep the Republican National Committee from having to take out a loan , according to Republican officials , Bush chipped in $12 million of his campaign funds that otherwise would have gone to his presidential library . Looking ahead , friends say Rove has already identified four voter groups to watch in 2008 : Catholics , Hispanics , suburban moderates and people with less than a college education . All four groups swung away from Republicans in this election . <P> Rove has not given up on his dream of a durable Republican majority , calling last week 's loss a " transient , passing thing . " <P> " The Republican Party remains at its core a small-government , low-tax , limit-spending , traditional-values , strong-defense party , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in a tough year . " Friends say Rove plans to lie low in the ' 08 race until a nominee is clear . Then , whether in or out of government , he will be the connection between the White House and the campaign , refereeing the candidate 's needs and Bush 's own .
