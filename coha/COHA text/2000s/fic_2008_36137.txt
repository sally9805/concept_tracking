AUGUST 4 , 1196 <br> MONTDHU , SCOTLAND <br> " SHE 'S BEING VERY FOOLISH . " Thea frowned as she watched Selene across the great hall . " I do n't like this , Ware . " <br> " Neither does Kadar , " Ware said cheerfully as he took a sip of his wine . " I 'm rather enjoying it . It 's interesting to see our cool Kadar disconcerted . " <br> " Will it also be interesting if Kadar decides to slaughter that poor man at whom she 's smiling ? " Thea asked tartly . " Or Lord Kenneth , who she partnered in the last country dance ? " <br> " Yes . " He smiled teasingly at her . " It 's been far too peaceful here for the last few years . I could use a little diversion . " <br> " Blood and war are not diversions except to warriors like you . " Her frown deepened . " And I thought you very happy here at Montdhu . You did not complain . " <br> He lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare with such a termagant of a wife . " <br> " Do n't tease . Have you been unhappy ? " <br> " Only when you robbed me of craftsmen for my castle so that you could have them build a ship for your silk trade . " <br> " I needed that ship . What good is it to produce fine silks if you ca n't sell them ? It was n't sensible to  --  " She shook her head . " You know I was right , and you have your castle now . It 's as fine and strong as you could want . Everyone at the feast tonight has told you they have never seen a more secure fortress . " <br> His smile faded . " And we might well have need of our fortress soon . " <br> She frowned . " Have you heard news from the Holy Land ? " <br> He shook his head . " But we walk a fine line , Thea . We 've been lucky to have these years to prepare . " <br> Ware was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , who could blame him ? They had fled the wrath of the Knights Templar to come to this land , and if the Knights found out that Ware was not dead , as they thought , they would be unrelenting in their persecution . Ware and Thea had almost been captured before their journey started . It had been Kadar who had bargained with Sinan , the head of the assassins , to lend them a ship to take them to Scotland . But that was the past , and Thea would not have Ware moody tonight when he had so much to celebrate . <br> " We 're not lucky , we 're intelligent . And the Knights Templar are foolish beyond belief if they think you would betray them . It makes me angry every time I think of it . Now drink your wine and enjoy this evening . We 've made a new life and everything is fine . " <br> He lifted his cup . " Then why are you letting the fact that your sister is smiling prettily at Lord Douglas upset you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes off her all evening . " Her gaze returned to her sister . Selene 's pale-gold silk gown made her dark-red hair glow with hidden fires , and her green eyes shone with vitality  --  and recklessness . The little devil knew exactly what she was doing , Thea thought crossly . Selene was impulsive at times , but this was not such an occasion . Her every action tonight was meant to provoke Kadar . " And I did n't invite the entire countryside to see your splendid new castle so that she could expose them to mayhem . " <br> " Tell her . Selene loves you . She wo n't want you unhappy . " <br> " I will . " She rose to her feet and strode down the hall toward the great hearth , before which Selene was holding court . Ware was right : Selene might be willful , but she had a tender heart . She would never intentionally hurt anyone she loved . All Thea had to do was confront her sister , express her distress , and the problem would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Thea . " <br> She glanced over her shoulder to see Kadar behind her . He had been leaning against the far pillar only seconds ago , but she was accustomed to the swift silence of his movements . <br> " Stop her ? " She smiled . " I do n't know what you mean . " <br> " And do n't lie to me either . " Kadar 's lips tightened . " I 'm a little too bad-tempered tonight to deal in pretense . " He took her arm and led her toward the nearest corner of the hall . " And you 've never done it well . You 're burdened with a pure and honest soul . " <br> " And I suppose you 're the devil himself . " <br> He smiled . " Only a disciple . " <br> " Nonsense . " <br> " Well , perhaps only half devil . I 've never been able to convince you of my sinful character . You never wanted to see that side of me . " <br> " You 're kind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , which proves what good judgment you have . " <br> " And arrogant , stubborn , and with no sense of humility . " <br> He inclined his head . " But I 've the virtue of patience , my lady , which should outweigh all my other vices . " <br> " Stop mocking . " She turned to face him . " You 're angry with Selene . " <br> " Am I ? " <br> " You know you are . You 've been watching her all evening . " <br> " And you 've been watching me . " One side of his lips lifted in a half smile . " I was wondering whether you 'd decide to attack me or Selene . " <br> " I have no intention of attacking anyone . " She stared directly into his eyes . " Do you ? " <br> " Not at the moment . I 've just told you how patient I am . " <br> Relief surged through her . " She does n't mean anything . She 's just amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced back toward the hearth . " She means to torment and hurt me and drive me to the edge . " His tone was without expression . " She does it very well , does n't she ? " <br> " It 's your fault . Why do n't you offer for her ? You know Ware and I have wanted the two of you to wed for this past year . Selene is ten and seven . It 's past time she had a husband . " <br> " I 'm flattered you 'd consider a humble bastard like myself worthy of her . " <br> " You are not flattered . You know your own worth . " <br> " Of course , but the world would say it was a poor match . Selene is a lady of a fine house now . " <br> " Only because you helped us escape from the Holy Land and start again . Selene was a slave in the House of Nicholas and only a child when you bought her freedom as a favor to me . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being given to his customers for their pleasure . You saved her , Kadar . Do you think she would ever look at another man if you let her come close to you ? " <br> " Do n't interfere , Thea . " <br> " I will interfere . You know better . She 's worshipped you since she was a child of eleven . " <br> " Worship ? She 's never worshipped me . She knows me too well . " He smiled . " You may not believe in my devilish qualities , but she does . She 's always known what I am . Just as I 've always known what she is . " <br> " She 's a hardworking , honest , loving woman who needs a husband . " <br> " She 's more than that . She 's extraordinary , the light in my darkness . And she 's still not ready for me . " <br> " Ready ? Most women her age have children already . " <br> " Most women have n't suffered as she suffered . It scarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " But can she ? " Thea glanced toward the hearth again . Oh , God , Selene was no longer there . <br> " It 's all right . She and Lord Douglas just left the hall and went out into the courtyard . " <br> How had he known that ? Sometimes it seemed Kadar had eyes in the back of his head . <br> " Kadar , do n't  --  " <br> He bowed . " If you 'll excuse me , I 'll go and bring her back . " <br> " Kadar , I wo n't have violence this night . " <br> " Do n't worry , I wo n't shed blood on the fine new rushes you put down on the floor . " He moved toward the courtyard . " But the stones of the courtyard wash up quite nicely . " <br> " Kadar ! " <br> " Do n't follow me , Thea . " His voice was soft but inflexible . " Stay out of it . This is what she wants , what she 's tried to goad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <br> Where was Kadar ? Selene wondered impatiently . She had been out here a good five minutes and he still had n't appeared . She did n't know how long she could keep Lord Douglas from taking her back to the hall . He was a boring , stodgy young man and had been shocked when she 'd suggested going out to the courtyard . " It 's a fine night . I do feel much better now that I 've had a breath of air . " <br> Lord Douglas looked uneasy . " Then perhaps we should go back inside . Lord Ware would not like us being out here alone . It 's not fitting . " <br> " In a moment . " Where was he ? She had felt his gaze on her all evening . He would have seen  --  <br> " The Saracen was watching us , " Lord Douglas said . " I 'm sure he will tell Lord Ware . " <br> " Saracen ? " Her gaze flew to his face . " What Saracen ? " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's what they call him . " <br> " Who are ' they ' ? " <br> He shrugged . " Everyone . " <br> " Kadar 's mother was Armenian , his father a Frank . " <br> He nodded . " A Saracen . " <br> She should be amused that he had put Kadar , who could never be labeled , in a tight little niche . She was not amused . She fiercely resented the faint patronizing note in his voice . " Why not call him a Frank like his father ? Why a Saracen ? " <br> " He just seems . . . He 's not like us . " <br> No more than a panther was like a sheep or a glittering diamond like a moss-covered rock , she thought furiously . " Kadar belongs here . My sister and her husband regard him as a brother . " <br> " Surely not . " He looked faintly shocked . " Though I 'm sure he 's good at what he does . These Saracens are supposed to be fine seamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " <br> She wanted to slap him . " Kadar does more than captain our ship . He 's a part of Montdhu . We 're proud and fortunate to have him here . " <br> " I did n't mean to make you  --  " <br> She lost track of what he was saying . <br> Kadar was coming . <br> She had known he would follow her , but Selene still smothered a leap of excitement as she caught sight of him in the doorway . He was moving slowly , deliberately , almost leisurely down the stairs . This was not good . That was n't the response she wanted from him . She took a step closer to Lord Douglas and swayed . " I believe I still feel a little faint . " <br> He instinctively put a hand on her shoulder to steady her . " Perhaps I should call the lady Thea . " <br> " No , just stay  --  " <br> " Good evening , Lord Douglas . " Kadar was coming toward them . " I believe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you go fetch her cloak ? " <br> " We were just going in , " Lord Douglas said quickly . " Lady Selene felt a little faint and we  --  " <br> " Faint ? " Kadar 's brows lifted as he paused beside them . " She appears quite robust to me . " <br> He 's not like us , Douglas had said . <br> No , he was n't like any of these men who had come to honor Ware tonight . He was like no one Selene had ever met . Now , standing next to heavyset , red-faced Lord Douglas , the differences were glaringly apparent . Kadar 's dark eyes dominated a bronze , comely face that could reflect both humor and intelligence . He was tall , his powerful body deceptively lean , with a grace and confidence the other man lacked . But the differences were not only on the surface . Kadar was as deep and unfathomable as the night sky , and it was no wonder these simple fools could not understand how exceptional he was . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I 'm sure she feels better now . " Kadar paused . " So you may remove your hand from her shoulder . " <br> Selene felt a surge of fierce satisfaction . This was better . Kadar 's tone was soft , but so was the growl of a tiger before it pounced . <br> Evidently Lord Douglas did n't miss the threat . He snatched his hand away as if burned . " She was afraid she would  --  " <br> " Selene is afraid of nothing . " He smiled at Selene . " Though she should be . " <br> Oh , yes , this was the Kadar she wanted to rouse . But he was wrong : She was afraid of him in this moment . She hid it as she smiled back at him . " I see nothing to fear . Lord Douglas can protect me . " <br> " Oh , I do n't think so . Because he 's going to go and fetch your cloak , are n't you , Lord Douglas ? " <br> Lord Douglas was nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should all return  --  " <br> " I need a word with the lady Selene . I 'm sure you 'll understand . " <br> Douglas drew a deep breath and then straightened his shoulders . " I feel it my duty to stay until she feels well enough to go back to the hall . " <br> She had n't counted on this . She had thought he would scurry away when Kadar showed his claws . Was he a fool that he could n't see the danger Kadar represented ? She shivered . " I do feel chilled . Would you please fetch my cloak , Douglas ? " <br> He hesitated and then , to her immense relief , took the out she 'd given him . He bowed . " As you wish . " <br> She watched him hurry across the courtyard . <br> " You 're usually better at reading people . " Kadar 's gaze was also on Lord Douglas . " He was braver than you thought . " <br> " Yes . " She did n't try subterfuge . It never worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brave or blind . He may be the one lacking in judgment . " She turned to face him , the excitement building . " What would you have done if I had n't sent him away ? " <br> " What do you think ? " <br> " I 'm asking you . " <br> " Killed him , " he said casually . " I was very irritated with our young lord . I was considering a knife to the belly . He would have died slowly and painfully . " <br> " Why were you irritated ? " <br> He smiled . " You know why . " <br> " Tell me . " <br> " He touched you . I 'm sure it was by your design , but he still touched you . How did it feel to have his hand on you ? " <br> She had barely been aware of that touch . She had been too focused on its effect on Kadar . " Exciting . " <br> He chuckled . " You lie . " <br> " Well , it could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living life like one of the nuns at the abbey . You have no right to complain . Do you think I do n't hear of the women you bed ? You 've not left a willing wench in the Highlands untouched , and heaven knows what you do on your journeys to Spain and Italy . " <br> " Heaven knows . " <br> " It 's not funny . And it 's not fair . " <br> " Life is unfair . " <br> " Well , I wo n't have it . I 'm weary of being the only woman in Scotland you wo n't bed . " <br> " So you tried to stir me to action with the sword of jealousy . As I remember , you threatened some such ploy before . Very clever . " He tilted his head . " But dangerous . " <br> " That was years ago . I was still a child . " <br> " You 're still a child in some ways . " <br> " I 'm not . Though you treat me as one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to wed me . " <br> His smile faded . " I know you do . " <br> " I . . . care about you . " <br> " I know . " <br> " And you feel something for me . I also know that , Kadar . " <br> " Oh , yes . " <br> " Then wed me . " She tried to smile . " You could hardly do better . Thea and I share the profits from the silk trade we started here at Montdhu . I 'm a fine match . " <br> " For any man . " He shook his head . " Not now , Selene . " <br> " Why not ? I told you , I 'm not a child any longer . I do n't remember ever feeling like a child . " <br> " That 's part of our problem . " <br> Continues ...
