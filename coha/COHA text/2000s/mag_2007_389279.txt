Geoff Ogilvy caught some breaks at last year 's U.S. Open , but he was also the only player who did n't backpedal under pressure . IF THE 1974 U.S. OPEN at Winged Foot was a massacre from the start , the 2006 edition was an ambush with the end in sight . When play ceased Sunday evening , Open dreams littered the 18th hole like broken glass . Harrington . Furyk . Montgomerie . Mickelson . One by one they cracked , making way for an easygoing Aussie named Geoff Ogilvy . The 29-year-old acknowledges the series of 12th-hour blunders that opened the door for him , but offers no apologies . " My name 's on the trophy forever , " he says . " It does n't really matter how it got there . " How it got there , of course , was not just dumb luck , but courtesy of some of the most clutch shotmaking you 'll ever see . Ogilvy 's road to glory was n't always this smooth . By his own admission he was a lousy student growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper . The recent birth of his daughter has helped soothe his inner beast , he says , and the perks that come to major champions  --  including a trip to Kauai , Hawaii , for the PGA Grand Slam of Golf , where we caught up with Ogilvy  --  have n't hurt either . Wearing shorts and flip-flops and sporting tousled hair that hinted he 'd just rolled out of bed , Ogilvy dished about Winged Foot , Tiger Woods and making small talk with George W. Bush . There 's a perception that you won the U.S. Open solely because of other players ' mistakes . How do you see it ? I finished how I needed to finish . There 's always going to be that question mark , or rather not question mark , but I mean , my name 's on the trophy . But , yes , I got a bit fortunate . I 've never seen a replay of Monty 's chunked 7-iron approach at 18 that led to a double bogey , but that evidently was a bit out of character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years ago . But my name 's on the trophy forever . It does n't really matter how it got there . You and Mickelson are friends . What was it like having a television camera in your face as you were watching him collapse on the 72nd hole ? By the time I got to the scorer 's hut , I 'm looking in at the TV and Phil is attempting his second shot . I just wanted to make sure I got my card right , so I did n't really have a sense for what was going on until his next one went in the bunker . Then they zoomed in on the lie and it started becoming apparent to me that something was n't going quite well for him . It 's hard , you know , to watch someone do that , but at the same time you do watch . It was weird , a very strange way to win a tournament . Have you spoken to Mickelson about how things played out ? Not really . I know Bones Jim Mackay , Mickelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small mentions about it , but it 's a hard thing to talk about . I 'm sure in a few years time when Phil 's won another five majors it 'll be a bit easier for him to swallow . We can talk about it then , but I 'm not going to bring it up because I feel kind of badly about it . Has it put a strain on your relationship ? We 're fine . We 're no less friendly than we were before . READER QUESTION* Do you feel like you still need to prove to yourself and others that you can execute at a major when it 's all on the line ?  --  Charles Seil , Sykeston , N.D. When you 're playing in the last few groups on the weekend at a U.S. Open , you 're thinking you have a chance to win . It 's in the back of your mind at least . The only point where I thought maybe I 'm not going to do this is when I was walking down the 15th fairway and Phil hit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I hit my second shot on 15 , I heard the cheer . So he goes two up ... but then at 17 we hear Phil bogeyed 16 and all of a sudden I 'm only one back . So at that point you thought you had a chance ? Yeah , I refreshed my thoughts about having a chance . I do n't know how different it would have been if I knew I was one shot in front , if I knew I had to make par . But I played those last four holes thinking about winning the U.S. Open . It would be nice to win another one day and come down the stretch five shots in front , so I 'd get more credit . In retrospect , of your chip-in at 17 , your pitch shot to six feet at 18 and the ensuing par putt , which shot was most clutch ? Each one was big at the time ; all three of them had to happen . The chip-in is what really put me back in the tournament . I was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just holed a 50-footer in front of me to go one in front and if I make bogey I 'm two behind . But I still thought if I can just get this up and down and birdie the last I have a chance . But then came the chip-in , and I thought , " If I can birdie the last I might win this . " How did you remain so poised when everybody around you was self-combusting ? Playing a golf course that difficult helps to distract you from the reality that you 're actually contending in the U.S. Open . You say to yourself , " This is a pretty tough hole . I 've got to just play this hole . It could end right here . " That helps  --  though it did n't feel as smooth as it looked probably . Laughs It always looks better than it feels . Does Oakmont sound like a good setup for you ? I do n't know . I would n't have thought any U.S. Open would set up well for me . I thought Winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they get so narrow with the fairways sometimes that it almost gives the advantage to guys like me who do n't hit it straight . Ogilvy finished 119th in driving accuracy in 2006 That sounds ridiculous , but the guy who hits 80 percent of his fairways hits only 50 percent in the U.S. Open , so he 's in the same position as me . In other words , the stronger , not-so-accurate hitters are almost at an advantage at the Open because everybody misses a lot of fairways . That hardly sounds fair . They 've probably gone overboard a couple of times , but I thought Winged Foot was perfect . With the graduated rough , at least there was a relationship between the quality of the tee shot and the ease of the second shot , which I think sometimes is a bit too black and white  --  it 's perfect or completely dead . Rough 's always more exciting to watch if guys can get out of it and move it up the near green . I do n't agree with having to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win as redemption for all the misfortune Greg Norman suffered in the majors ? I do n't know if my win was any redemption for Norman , but I think Australia has been hungry for majors , and hopefully I 've recaptured the Australian public 's imagination . They got used to seeing Norman up there every year . Whether he was winning or losing , they still had something to watch at the majors . Now there 's a whole bunch of Australians who can do a lot . Can you fill Norman 's shoes ? No chance . Norman 's larger that life . That would be like trying to fill Tiger 's shoes or Arnold 's shoes . Norman 's Norman  --  there 's never going to be another . Scotty Adam Scott could come close . He 's got the whole package , and it 's only a matter of time before he wins a big one see sidebar , p. 142. 2006 was a brilliant season for Australians in general . Much of that is attributable to Australia 's state-funded golf institutes , like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than America 's ? The system I went through is the only one I know , so I do n't know if it 's better . But Australia seems to be maximizing its potential at the moment  --  maybe not maximizing it , but at least more so than the U.S. We should only have about four people on Tour because we 've only got 20 million people in Australia . Twenty-one Australians have PGA Tour cards in 2007 The U.S. has 300 million people . So we must be getting more out of our players than the U.S. How do the institutes work ? No stone is left unturned . You 're not pushed into anything , but you 're given the opportunity to learn about nutrition , fitness , psychology . You 've got great coaches for your technique . There are seminars on every single aspect of life  --  financial planning , travel , relaxation , everything to do with golf . It 's unbelievable . They say , " This is here . If you want to take it , you have the opportunity to do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at the White House honoring John Howard , the prime minister of Australia . How 'd you score an invite ? I was playing the Byron Nelson and I got a phone call from my office , and they said , " We 've got an invitation from the White House here . " It was for Tuesday night or something and at this point it 's like Friday . So I 'd have to fly home , have one night in Scottsdale , then fly all the way back across the country . I was like , " Aww , really ? " I did n't know what the invitation was . Then I was told it was a state dinner with only about 100 people going , including the President and the Prime Minister of Australia . So I said , " Oh , I think we better go to this one . " Laughs . It was just ridiculous . I sat at a table with the President , John Howard 's wife , Rupert Murdoch , Condoleezza Rice . Why I was there was just bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had even won the Open . My best guess is that the president likes to have someone nonpolitical at his table who he can talk with about the basketball , or something else . Someone who 's not going to start asking questions about the economy and stuff . And so they must have said let 's pick an Australian because of John Howard . Let 's see  --  a golfer ! Here we go ! How do you make small talk with the president ? Yeah , I do n't know . The president was great . He has dinners like that every night so he 's good at getting the ball rolling with people he has n't met before . But I guess you speak second to the president ; you wait for him to ask you a question . Obviously , he wanted to talk about anything but what was going on in the world . In an interview last year you called Bush " a bit dangerous . " Did you tell him that at dinner ? I said that before I met him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guy you want to have a few beers with  --  a really cool guy . So you did n't tell him ? No , I did n't tell him I did n't agree with his foreign policy . I stayed away from that one . Laughs . What do I know , anyway ? I just go by what I read in the newspapers . PGA Tour pros are generally a conservative lot . Did your anti-Bush comments cause you any grief ? No , the article was printed in Ireland . Every pro has his opinions , and they 're all different . Our opinions really do n't mean anything because all we do is hit a golf ball around . But you 're a U.S. Open champion now . Your opinions mean more than they used to . That 's just ridiculous , because what do I know ? It 's silly , really . If you wanted to ask me what it feels like to hit a five-foot putt on the last hole of the U.S. Open I 've probably got a valid opinion , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbed as a good quote , an insightful thinker . I do n't think I have any good insights . I think I can just b.s. better than most . Do your sponsors ever try to rein you in ? No , not really . You have to stay away from political comments , but apart from that you can say whatever you want . Were you a good student growing up ? Not really . I did n't like school . I do n't think they taught us the right stuff . I just never agreed with trigonometry or physics or any of that stuff . It 's all bollocks . They should teach you financial planning or nutrition  --  stuff that 's actually going to affect your life . My goal was just to pass , and I did . When did you realize that golf was your calling ? Golf was always the sport that was going to win out . The appeal was that I could go out after school and play on my own ; I did n't need anybody else . I played on Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when one of my teammates would mess it up for the rest of the team  --  or if I messed it up . That just really annoyed me . In golf , it 's your fault and your fault only . Which brings us to your temper , and your struggle to control it . Where did that rage come from ? It comes from my mum 's side . From the genetics side , I can blame her . I always had high expectations for myself and still probably do . And you get frustrated when you do n't meet your expectations instantly . I 'm no different than Tiger . Tiger 's the angriest guy on Tour , but he never lets it affect the next shot . He 's angry for five seconds and then it 's gone . He 'd admit that , too  --  it 's not a detriment . But there was a time when you 'd go back to your hotel room after a bad round and berate yourself in the bathroom mirror . Yeah , all day I 'd be telling myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else talked to you like that you would n't be friends with them . So I just started being more positive . Instead of saying , " You 're a bad putter , " I 'd say , " You 're a good putter . " It might have been a lie at that particular time , but if you can choose to say one or the other , you might as well say the one that going 's to make you feel better . What was the low point ? Did you snap any putters ? A couple of times . I 've never actually broken a putter over my knee , but I 've thrown it against my bag and bent it a little bit , so I could n't use it anymore . When you have to putt with your driver for that last six holes that 's just embarrassing . Everyone gasps when you walk on to the green and pull your driver out . It 's not a very cool thing ; it 's a bad look . It 's just not enjoyable to keep riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . I 'd be fishing or hunting or something . You never sought professional help . Why not ? I 've talked to a couple of guys , but none of these golf-specific psychologists . They 're only telling you something that you already know . They do n't know how you feel when you 're playing your best . They can just sort of point you in the right direction . Deep down , everybody knows what is the right way to think . It 's quite obvious : the right way to think is " I 'm going to hole this putt " as opposed to " What chance have I got to hole this putt ? " You just have to have the discipline to notice that you 're thinking badly . A couple years ago you started spending less time on the practice range and actually got better . What 's your secret ? Every now and then I 'll spend time on the range if I need to , but I used to start picking at my game too much . If I started hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd start picking my swing apart , and by the end of a few hours on the range , I was a complete mess . If I took a week off , the first day I hit balls would feel the best . So I started by just not hitting balls after my round , and I did n't feel like I lost anything . And then when I 'd go home and practice during a week off , I 'd experiment and just play without any practice on the range . So I started to realize maybe you do n't need to hit 500 balls a day to be any good . Try telling that to Vijay . For every Vijay or Tiger , there are the same number of guys who maybe do n't practice at all  --  Ernie Els , Fred Couples . These guys would probably be annoyed that I said that , but they 're not Vijay or Tiger . I mean , they practice , but they 're much more chilled out . It 's just a matter of finding out where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For me , a small amount is good . You 've said you like facing Tiger at his best . That true ? When he 's dominating a golf course , it 's golf the way it 's meant to be played . It 's fun to watch , do n't you think ? Sure , but not if you 're competing against him . Well , he 's harder to beat . But how good is it if I win when he 's playing his best ? I can say , " I beat the best golfer of all time when he was playing his best . " It must be fun to watch him up close . Even if he 's playing badly he 's fun to watch , because he 's in the trees and then hitting amazing shots out of the trees . Phil 's the same way . He 's hit some shots out of the junk that just are n't normal . There are some golfers you play with who you just sit back and watch them play . Phil and Tiger are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop it up there in the middle of the fairway , hit 80 percent of their greens and hole a few putts here and there , but it 's not as fun to watch guys like that . Could you ever ascend to Tiger 's level ? He 's always going to be a better player than me by a long way . If we played 100 times , he 'd probably beat me 80 times . But if I can beat him 20 times , that would be nice . You and your wife , Juli , had a baby girl in October . Could fatherhood distract you from golf ? It could , but there are good and bad distractions . I used to go back and mope around the hotel room . I 'm not going to do that anymore . It 's another outlet that 's not golf that I can think about . She 's not going to care if I three-putted the last three holes . But she might care if you win another major . Do you feel like you need to win another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win another one because it would give more credibility to the first one . But if I do n't , at least I get to sit down when I 'm older and say , " I won the U.S. Open . " GEOFF IN A JIFFY Age : 29 Height : 6 ' ' 2 " Weight : 180 lbs .

AS : No , because I 'm still pretty confident that I 'm going to win a major , or two , or three , in my career . It was important for an Australian to win a major . We were getting a lot of pressure from back home , like , " Who 's gon na win one ? " Deep down , does Geoff feel like he hit the lottery ? AS : He probably does feel a little fortunate for what happened there with Phil , but it 's all part of the game . I think there 's definitely winner 's luck involved in any tournament . He took advantage of it . Other guys did n't . So Geoff 's win has lifted the weight of Australia 's major hopes off your shoulders ? AS : Absolutely , but I want to win one , too , obviously .
