The president 's most heartfelt values initiative <p> At the first White House tee-ball game , played on the South Lawn in May , a seven-year-old batter stepped to the tee , took a big cut , missed the ball , stepped back , took another swing , and sent a hard line drive to right field . It looked like a sure hit , until a young outfielder snagged it with a quick jab of his glove . With that , George W. Bush , sitting in the bleachers along the first-base line , jumped to his feet . " What a catch ! " the president yelled , laughing and applauding and appearing more excited than some of the parents around him , many of whom remained in their seats . <p> It was a spontaneous burst of enthusiasm from a man who seemed delighted to be watching baseball in his backyard-even tee ball , played by kids eight and under with no pitchers and no keeping score . But tee-ball games ( three so far , with another scheduled for September ) are more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was clear before the first game even began , when the president delivered a brief , off-the-cuff homily to the players and parents . <p> " I also want to thank coaches all across America , " Bush said as he paced around the infield , " who help young men and women understand the importance of teamwork and playin ' by the rules , and help young men and women understand that baseball is a fabulous sport . " Bush thanked the parents " who love their children every single day and love ' em so much that they 're willin ' to go out and watch ' em play Little League baseball . " Dropping every g in sight , Bush continued : " There 's nothin ' better than knowin ' that America is full of lovin ' moms and dads who are at the ballparks every day as the summer unfolds . " Finally , Bush turned to the teams and led the players in reciting the Little League pledge : " I trust in God . I love my country and will respect its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But win or lose , I will always do my best . " <p> It was simple and heartfelt and corny , in a way not often heard in official Washington . And Bush seemed to love it ; during the game he appeared as engaged and happy as at any time during his six months in the White House . For Bush , tee ball is not only a way to nurture a game he loves-he often frets that not enough kids are playing Little League ball-but a way to do precisely what some of his liberal critics feared he would do : promote a return to 1950s values in America . Much more than his upcoming values initiative called " Communities of Character " -a grab bag of politically popular mini-programs devoted to topics like good citizenship and teenage sexual abstinence-Bush 's South Lawn gatherings are the real thing . If you want to see the real Bush values agenda at work , watch him at the tee-ball games . LITTLE LEAGUE IN MIDLAND <p> Bush is the first president to have played Little League baseball . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , when Oprah Winfrey asked him to name his fondest childhood memory , Bush answered simply , " Little League baseball in Midland . " His mother and father were both boosters ; in the 1980s , Little League named its parents-of-the-year prize the George and Barbara Bush Award . During the 2000 presidential campaign , sensing that they might soon have an alumnus in the White House , Little League officials did some research and found the four original rosters for George W. Bush 's teams from 1955 through 1958 . They 're now on display on the league 's website . <p> After the election was decided , league officials sent Bush adviser Karen Hughes a package of information about Little League . The material stressed the old-fashioned values of the league pledge and suggested that there might be projects that Little League and the White House could do together . " We said if there 's anything Little League can do for the White House , just let us know , " says league official Lance Van Auken . <p> As it turned out , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the White House saying the president wanted to hold games on the lawn . White House officials asked Van Auken and Little League to handle most of the details : picking the teams , rounding up volunteers to provide equipment , and designing uniforms-both teams are called the South Lawn Sluggers . Tee ball was chosen not only because of the appeal of young kids but because it would not be possible to play real baseball on the White House lawn ; nobody wanted to worry about hot foul balls flying all over the place . <p> Bush announced the games on March 30 , when he hosted a White House reception for members of baseball 's Hall of Fame . The gathering was an occasion for Bush to wax lyrical , at least for him , about the game . " Everyone who loves baseball can remember the first time he saw the inside of a real major-league park with real big-league players , " Bush said , describing the first game he ever saw , at the Polo Grounds in the 1950s . " It stays with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major leaguers in uniform , the sound of a big-league swing meeting a big-league pitch . <p> " In a small way , maybe we can help to preserve the best of baseball right here in the house that Washington built , " Bush continued . " After we moved in , I pointed out to a great baseball fan , the First Lady , that we 've got a pretty good-sized backyard here . And maybe with the help of some of the groundskeepers , we could play ball on the South Lawn . So for the next four seasons , we 're going to invite kids here from the area to play tee ball on the South Lawn of the White House . " <p> In May , two days before the first game , Bush discussed his hopes for tee ball when he hosted a White House reception for the World Series champion New York Yankees . Telling the players that the games would be " a chance to celebrate the great sport of baseball , " Bush then gave the world a hint about the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hallowed grounds , " Bush told the team . " So is the White House . " A FIFTIES GUY <p> When Bush first announced the tee-ball games , he met with a certain amount of derision from the talking-head corps . " It 's obviously a public-relations stunt , " political scientist and pundit Larry Sabato told the Los Angeles Times . " Bush used to say that he will restore honor and integrity to the White House . Now he should amend that and say he 's restoring honor , integrity , and the 1950s to the White House . " <p> Sabato was echoing a common liberal critique of Bush as a man determined to return America to the 1950s . Maureen Dowd has called him " Eisenhower with hair . " Molly Ivins has called him " President **26;1635;TOOLONG . " And dozens of other critics have suggested Bush wants to " turn back the clock " to an earlier era . <p> As silly as that commentary seems , the critics have a point-although it 's one they might not want to acknowledge . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically correct nightmare of racial injustice , sexual repression , and gender inequality . But Bush 's 1950s is something else entirely . It 's the Little League pledge ( which was , indeed , written in the ' 50s by then-Little League president Peter McGovern ) . It 's God , country , and fair play-things George W. Bush learned about in the first decade of his life . For Bush , Midland Little League was in the ' 50s . That first , magical visit to the Polo Grounds was in the ' 50s . And his most treasured baseball heroes played during that time . " I 'm just a little biased toward those of you who played back in the ' 50s , " Bush told the Hall of Famers in March . " It was my prime as a baseball-card collector " <p> The invocation of ' 50s values also has a political usefulness for Bush . It 's no accident that the tee-ball games are produced by the White House Office of Communications , which is responsible for helping shape Bush 's message on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of a president with **27;1663;TOOLONG values is a powerful part of Bush 's campaign to differentiate himself from his predecessor . While Bush 's supporters believe he returned honor and dignity to the Oval Office simply by moving in , the tee-ball program illustrates the extent to which , after more than six months in office , the Bush White House still wants to make sure everyone knows that George W. Bush is the opposite of Bill Clinton . <p> " It 's clear that America thinks this is a president who 's honest , who has dignity and character , " explains an administration official . " They 've had enough of the last eight years . Because of all the foolishness that was happening in the White House back then , tee ball is almost like a wave of fresh air . The picture was on the front page of every major paper-Los Angeles Times , New York Times , Washington Post . The point is , tee ball is n't the reason people like him , but it 's initiatives like this that show the wholesomeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful presidents . " COMMUNITIES OF CHARACTER <p> Eddie Garretson hit it off with George W. Bush right away . A northern Virginia construction manager , Garretson is a coach in what is called the " Challenger Little League , " a special Little League program for disabled kids , and his team took part in a White House tee-ball game in July . " A more sincere person , I do n't think I 've ever met , " says Garretson , who , like Bush , was a catcher in Little League years ago . " We talked about the past , about what it was like catching back then , about our flannel uniforms , which were hot as the dickens . " <p> Other parents and coaches report the same sort of reception at the White House ; so far , tee ball has been a very big hit . And it 's still going on . In addition to having Bush visit the Little League World Series in August-a first for a sitting president-the White House plans one more South Lawn game for September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These games will go on for four years , and hopefully eight , " says an administration official . " It 's a natural fit for the president . " <p> It 's a natural fit because everybody knows Bush loves baseball . What is likely to be a less natural fit is the upcoming " Communities of Character " campaign-which , in its political aspect , will be an attempt to increase Bush 's popular support at a time when he will be engaged in knock-down , drag-out fights with Congress over the budget , patients ' rights , and other contentious issues . The irony of a White House beginning a series of quintessentially Clintonian initiatives-even as it tries to stress the contrast between George W. Bush and Bill Clinton-has not been lost on Bush 's critics in both political parties . Beyond that , there are worries about whether Bush can pull it off . While Clinton-who used small-bore initiatives to help distract the public from the scandals that engulfed his presidency-had the salesmanship to push programs that meant little to him , Bush does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It means a lot to George W. Bush . When he 's using baseball to preach about values , Bush has a genuine passion that can not be readily transferred to other topics . Sure , encouraging grandparents to use e-mail to correspond with their grandchildren-one of the Communities of Character initiatives-is a worthwhile idea . But if Bush wants to make a genuine statement about values-straight from his heart , as he might say-perhaps he should stick to tee ball . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Bush and tee ball : a natural fit <p> By Byron York <p>
