We 're looking for the Keyhole , and Aryeh Copa is lost . He has lived in Steamboat for 13 years . He has probably skied here a thousand days . He was in the Keyhole just yesterday . But 21 inches of new snow makes everything look different : Pines sag wearily . Rocks become pillows . Tracks and postholes blur and fade away . The Keyhole is the only entrance to the Boulderfields , one of the few wide-open bowls in Fish Creek Canyon , the resort 's out-of-bounds area some call the Ten Adventures . The word " bowl " does n't really describe the terrain . It 's more like a quarry : On one rim , the cliff walls are 30 feet high . On the other , they push 100 . If you know where you 're going , there 's just enough room to sneak in between . If not , you 'll likely end up trapped atop a massive rock yelling for help . Copa , in a red secondhand Marlboro windbreaker  --  the kind you get by collecting cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the side hill for a minute or two , then makes a few turns . " Yeah , this is definitely the right way to go , " he calls back . We traverse , then sidestep up , then sweep around a rock . " Wait ... this looks totally different with all the stuff on the branches . " He pauses . " There are maybe a hundred people who know how to get here , and about 30 who ski it regularly , " he says . " But sometimes you grope your way to the Keyhole only to find it 's been had . " Finally , Copa recognizes something  --  or maybe just feels something , the negative space between trunks and limbs , the cant of the hill . " We got it ! " he yells . " Just do what I do . " The entrance is a short five-foot drop over a cliff band into the basin below . It 's already close to 3 P.M. , but the Boulderfields are still untouched  --  Jeep-sized marshmallow lumps await . Copa makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The snow curls from his tips and smokes to his waist . Mention Steamboat to most skiers and they have visions of aspens as evenly spaced as apple trees in an orchard . They think of cowboys and barns . They think of Champagne Powder light enough for trademark status . What does n't come to mind is anything remotely steep : The place is more rolling hill than sharp peak , an undulating splay that fans out from a single base area and gently bumps the sky with a few rounded summits . Understandably , it is sometimes called Flatboat . That 's inbounds . But locals like Copa , who is a freeskier and photographer and designs downhill mountain-bike parks in the off-season , do n't ski inbounds . People like Copa grab people like Dan Gilchrist  --  who tele skis for filmmakers Steve Winter and Warren Miller when he 's not working as a general contractor  --  and dip just outside the backcountry gates , where lines like Styx and Nostrils and Snarl are closer to 50 degrees than 35 . They carry titanium pipes next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a handful of lemon-crme cookies . And they can telemark down chutes and off boulders most people would n't even attempt on alpine gear . With mountain-town job rsums reflecting years of carpentry , photography , and ski modeling work , the Copas and Gilchrists of Steamboat could live at any resort . Instead , they 've stuck around for more than a decade . The Keyhole is the reason . Most of the backcountry spills off the north side of the resort from the top of Mount Werner , what some call Telephone Peak , where a jumble of satellite dishes mark the summit . Before the new Morningside triple was installed for the 1996-97 season , skiers used to hike along the ridge and up just 200 feet from Storm Peak to Mount Werner . It was enough of a hike that the backcountry remained fairly secretive ; most skiers just headed for the inbounds bumps and the low-angle groomers . Among locals , the hike-to area was called Toots  --  some claim it came from the French toute neige , or " all snow . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toot 's Routes . " With a comfy lift ride bringing skiers within a three-minute walk of this formerly hidden area , however , the secret is now out . " When I first started working here 28 years ago , only a handful of people went out-of-bounds , " says John Kohnke , head of Steamboat 's ski patrol . " You had to sign in on a clipboard and then call us when you got back . " But as the number of tracks increased , the number of followers  --  and rope duckers  --  increased . The resort tried to manage the trail-breaking by designating a few official outlets . For liability reasons , Steamboat does n't refer to its exits as " gates "  --  something that can be opened and closed  --  they 're simply " access points " to public Forest Service land . But the patrol , since its staffers know the lay of the land better than the local sheriff does , is usually called in for help when something goes wrong . Which does n't happen often ; the trees and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long , high-alpine avy flumes in Colorado 's San Juans and Utah 's Wasatch . " There has n't been an accident in forever , " says Kohnke . " The biggest problem is getting lost out there . It 's a maze of confused tracks . " The terrain is convoluted , furrowed with drainages and false eyelets that close up  --  or turn into cliffs . " But people love poking around here . They spend all day exploring . Every shot , nook , and cranny is named , and a lot of them are only three turns long . " The next morning , I head to the bronze Billy Kidd statue near the gondola building to meet Copa for another tour . Kids sip cocoa and parents wipe noses while a virtual Billy in aviator glasses , bolo tie , and cowboy hat introduces guests to Ski Town USA from a few TV screens . Copa shows up late , but he brings breakfast : a king-size Snickers and a V-8 . We ride to the top of Storm Peak chair , where Copa skates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Werner . The statue is buffed shiny from countless gloved hands . " We always touch him before we head into the backcountry , " Copa says , tweaking Buddy 's ear . " He brings us luck , and he brings us snow . In a really good year , you can sit on his head  --  and this year we 're close . In the summer , he 's 20 feet off the ground . " Copa and I step out to the " weather stick , " a meadow junction where tracks split in five directions . But the stick , once jammed into the ground to gauge snow depth , is long gone . Take a right and you get stuck with the mandatory air of Bowling Alley . Go left and you might find the most wide-open line in the canyon , Granola Bowl . We go straight , snaking our way through dense trees , one turn at a time , before Copa hops off 20-foot Airport Rock and floats away on 190-cm Hart Fatbacks . I arc around Airport Rock . The snow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it , crossing Copa 's landing hole , staying close enough to his tracks to follow but far enough away to feel freewheeling . The slope tips down for a few turns , then levels out into the bottom of the canyon . Unfortunately , the bottom of the canyon , a drainage called Endless Gully , is nowhere near the end of the road . The exit requires at least 20 minutes of left-hand traversing along the north side of Mount Werner , something that frustrates most alpine skiers and all snowboarders but is n't a problem on freeheel gear . As we 're gliding  --  and clomping  --  out of the canyon , Copa limps . Three years ago , heli-skiing in Alaska , he cartwheeled his way to a fractured femur and torn ACL , PCL , MCL , LCL , and both menisci . " My kneecap was twisted around my knee . My doctor said I was screwed , " he says , while sidestepping left and taking a breath . " I got a few cadaver grafts . There are a lot of personalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep ramp called Thousand Steps that winds through the forest just outside the ski area boundary . By the time we gain BC Ski Way , a cat track that wraps around the north side of the resort back down to the base , Copa 's soaked through his windbreaker . He turns it inside out , puts it back on to dry , and ski-ballets between knock-kneed tots and wedge-turning seniors down to the base area . Skiing the Steamboat backcountry is largely a solitary affair . You might hear a few distant voices , the scrape of edge to rock ; you might ski through the hanging mist leftover from another skier 's line . To find the backcountry fraternity that I 've heard about from Copa and Gilchrist , I return to the Boat on closing weekend and tag along with Copa to an out-of-bounds gathering spot known as Area 51 . To get there , Copa and I veer under the ropes bordering Tomahawk , the southernmost run on the mountain , while a few skiers rush down to catch the Sunshine lift before last chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovel-carved benches , eating blackberry cheesecake with cold fingers while holding Buds between their knees . " Anyone want some mahi ? " asks a guy tromping around in Scarpas and an apron and carrying a foil packet full of grilled fish . Gilchrist is already here . He grabs a grilled wonton from a frizzy redhead making the rounds in a neon Alpina jacket . She grins . Someone is trying to toss plastic rings over a tequila bottle buried in the snowbank . Three skiers warm their hands over the fire . Another makes bruschetta . Gilchrist leans in to me . " There 's a great tele vibe here . Just look around , " he says . And then , as if to not overstate the Boat 's appeal , he adds , " but there are bigger and radder mountains out there . " Copa , in Hawaiian shirt , grabs the rings . " You 're right on about that , " he declares as he sends the first ring far wide . The second one clinks off the glass . But the third ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Copa pulls the bottle from the snow , takes a few gulps of tequila , and stomps over to us . " But here you can get over-the-head face shots every single day of the winter , " Gilchrist whispers . You just need to know where you 're going . Set me loose to find Nosebleed and I 'd end up on Hangin ' Tree Gully . Ask me to show you Rockchopper and I 'd get stuck above 90-foot Hell 's Wall . Still , rummaging around for the Boulderfields might be worth the risk . When Copa and I collected at the runout that early-February afternoon , he looked back at his furrows and grinned . " This is why we stay here , " he said . " Some people do n't like hiking to get powder , but look at what we just did ! " OB OPTIONS Want to rack up vertical ? Skip Endless Gully and head for the Boat 's other backcountry stashes . Grab a pair of skins and a local with a sled , or sign up with an outfitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling knolls , and gullies that get pounded by 600 inches of snow a year ( the resort averages 335 ) . Try Soda Mountain , Pepsi Ridge , and Bitch Creek for steeps . SCENE : Bustling . It 's the most popular place in the area for sleds carrying skiers  --  or just high-marking . Get there early for a parking spot . DIRECTIONS : Two miles north of Steamboat on CR 323 , then 12 miles northeast on 60 . Trip duration : 15 minutes from town . SAND MOUNTAIN BETA : A blunt peak with a cat-scratch of chutes running its face . Once you snowmobile in , boot-pack laps on lower , wide-open Race Face . SCENE : Graybeards with straight skis tool around in the woods while huckers launch off Sand 's Mavericks-like cornices . DIRECTIONS : West on Highway 40 to CR 129 ; turn left on CR 62 to Forest Road 42 , then left on FR 480 . Trip duration : 40 minutes from town . HAHN 'S PEAK BETA : The place to don your skins if you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have to hike to the bald summit . Take the northeast side , a 34-degree , 1,800-vertical-foot line . SCENE : Quiet . Some people do n't bother trying to climb the whole hill and just poke for stashes in the trees . Snowmobiles can only get so far before it 's too steep . DIRECTIONS : West on High-way 40 to CR 129 until you get to Columbine . Trip duration : 45 minutes from town . STEAMBOAT POWDERCATS BETA : The best option if you do n't have a smowmobile . For $320 , you get 15,000 vertical feet , a three-course meal , and a cushy snowcat ride at Buff Pass . SCENE : While the cats trundle up and down the roads , snowmobiles buzz them like flies , but the Powdercats guides take you to untracked shots every single run . DIRECTIONS The meeting place is 100 yards from the gondola building . ( 800-288-0543 ; **26;2002;TOOLONG ) Illustration COLOR PHOTO : PHOTOGRAPH BY ARYEH COPA Flatboat ? Hardly .
