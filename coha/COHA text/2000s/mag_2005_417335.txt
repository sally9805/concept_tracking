In the fall of 2003 , in the biggest wildfire in California history , 22 people lost their lives , thousands more lost their homes , and hundreds of thousands of acres burned . It was a terrible fire year for the entire country-almost 5 million acres went up in flames . Yet , by recent standards , 2003 was n't off the charts . In 2002 , 7 million acres burned . Today 's fires burn more intensely than did those of past decades , scientists say . But as we all know from the nightly news , these fires , no longer confined to wilderness areas , also tear into residential neighborhoods with horrifying results . When 137,000 acres caught fire in Florida in 1998 , 25,000 people near Daytona Beach fled their homes . Three years earlier , eastern Long Island faced 40-foot waves of flame . Why have wildfires-a threat that once seemed to have disappeared-returned with such fury ? To find out , VT interviewed Stephen J. Pyne , author of the new book Tending Fire : Coping with America 's Wildland Fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona State University in Tempe , Pyne is no ivory tower intellectual : He spent 15 years as a fire fighter at the Grand Canyon and at Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks . Q : You write that fire had once " receded from everyday life " but is now " more virulent than ever . " Why ? What 's going on ? A : We 've made public lands-supposedly protected places-habitats for fire because of the way we manage them . In our determination to keep them from burning , we 've allowed the very things that catch fire-pine needles , twigs , brush-to accumulate . So when lightning strikes or a campfire gets out of control , fire spreads more quickly than it otherwise might . At the same time , we 've begun building housing developments next to woodlands . This complicates matters . We know how to fight fires in woodlands . We know how to fight fires in towns . But these are two different challenges . So when a wildfire in the woods spreads to the suburbs , fire fighters who are trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond . So a fire can roar through one of those housing developments , causing devastation . Q : Have we always viewed fire this way-with these results ? A : No . Years ago , we used fire routinely in farming . We understood fire better then , so we were n't as terrified by it . We knew it could be used responsibly . Native Americans also once used fire regularly . They burned their fields , which helped limit the accumulation of brush and branches that fuel wildfires . But Native Americans were driven out . Then settlers in the 187Os and 188Os overgrazed the lands , stripping them of the grasses that tend to burn slowly , and replacing them-again-with materials that burn quickly . By the time protected lands were created , our impulse was to suppress all fires that would naturally occur otherwise . That meant pine needles , twigs , etc. , were allowed to build up . Insects , with all the damage they do , were allowed to thrive . In times of drought and high wind , these " protected " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it burns more intensely and spreads more rapidly . Photograph // Q : You 're suggesting that some amount of fire is good . A : It is . Fire functions ecologically in a way that nothing else does . Fire performs biological work that only it can do . It sets into motion a natural recycling of plants and animals . Old trees and bushes are cleared away , so the wind and sun can reach the soil . New species can replenish an area . We almost never think of the good things fire does ; we have been conditioned to think only of the damage . We think that fire destroys a log , for instance , which it does . But by destroying the log , it releases everything in the log for other important biological purposes . When a log is turned to ash , phosphorous , calcium and magnesium are released . These chemicals are put into circulation again-in the air , soil or water . Different environmental conditions favor different species of plants . Some plants need lots of light ; others do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned-over areas , while others go to seed , waiting for new conditions in which they will do well . The best ecological system is one in which there is continual change , and new species come and go . Periodic fires help make that possible . Q : So fire can be a good thing . But what 's the worst that can happen if we continue in our present course of trying to suppress it ? A : You ca n't suppress fire . Fire will come-through lightning , if nothing else-and when it does , it will spread more rapidly and burn even more intensely in areas that no fire has claimed recently . As a result , it will do more damage than a " normal " fire would have done . You 're destroying the same wilderness you 've set out to protect . Also , unless the brush and pine needles I keep talking about are burned off regularly or otherwise removed , they form a " pavement " of pine needles and twigs that covers up flowers and grasses , which is terrible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they change the chemical composition of the soil , making it more acidic . Most flowers and grasses need soil that is more alkaline , so they wo n't grow where pine needles build up . Q : Surely the people who set fire policy understand this , right ? A : It has been a long-standing debate . Back in 1910 , when what became known as the Great Fires swept across the West , the government adopted a policy of suppressing fire . The Great Fires were never to happen again . For about 50 years after that , fire was something to be fought . But , starting in the 196Os , when so much conventional wisdom was questioned , there was a shift . Certain policymakers came to understand that some fire was good , and that fires could even be started- " prescribed fires , " they 're called-to do vital cleanup work within our protected areas . However , not everyone agreed . This has been an area of controversy ever since , leading to standoffs . Timber industry people say you can safeguard public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which can be a pretext for logging on protected public forests . Thinning is when you clear out some of the smaller trees , which burn just like dry shrubs . Unfortunately , extreme environmentalists oppose all thinning , even when appropriate , because they equate it with logging . They also oppose fighting any fires . Because they believe fire is natural and that natural is good , they say , " Let it burn . " So we 're not making nearly as much progress as we should . And things are just getting worse . Q : In what way ? A : We 're inviting worse fires . And because we do n't think clearly about these issues , we use resources irresponsibly . Here 's an example : Instead of controlled burning in wilderness areas , we could go in with chain saws and clear out the brush and chop up the smaller trees . But chain saws still do n't work as effectively as fire does . And chain saws also create a lot of " slash " - branches and twigs and debris-which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get trucks in there to haul off the slash . The trucks burn fossil fuel . So do chain saws . By not letting fire do its job , we 're creating all kinds of environmental problems . We 're trading one set of problems for another , and often for worse problems . Think of it this way : Centuries ago , when we used fire in our daily lives-for burning our farmlands , for heating our homes-we used open fire . But as we found alternatives to open fire , we confined fire to combustion chambers . It 's still there ; we 're still using it . But instead of burning logs , we now burn fossil fuels-at great environmental cost . Global warming is mainly a consequence of burning fossil fuels in combustion chambers . Q : But open burning carries environmental costs , too , right ? A : Burning imposes some costs , certainly . Burning brush releases greenhouse gases , though not to the degree that burning fossil fuels does . So , in many cases , open burning is still the most efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we said , we ca n't really get away from . We need to recognize the reality that fire is ever-present and then make responsible , informed decisions about how and under what circumstances to use fire . Q : Can you offer an example ? A : I remember a time when , every spring , people burned their lawns as a matter of course . I have Bermuda grass , and burning it is the only really effective way to clean up the yard for the next season . But because you ca n't legally do that anymore , you have to rent a de-thatching machine , a kind of vertical rake that-like a chain saw-uses a small combustion engine . This tears up the Bermuda grass . Then you rake it up and put it in plastic bags . Then the bags are hauled away in gasoline-powered trucks to a landfill . There , it decomposes , producing methane gas , which is a far worse greenhouse gas than the carbon dioxide you 'd get from burning the lawn . We refuse to use fire intelligently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , we end up creating worse problems than we 're trying to solve . Fire can do great things for a lawn and its soil , releasing nutrients from the ash and clearing away dead matter . But because we no longer use fire for those purposes , we find substitutes . We use chemical fertilizers and herbicides , but where do we get those chemicals ? Mainly from fossil fuels . It would make more sense if , one day every spring , people just burned their lawns and got it over with . It 'd be done with a lot less environmental damage . Q : How about when we fight fires ? A : We make similar blunders there . We drop retardants on wildfires-retardants that are agricultural fertilizers . Proponents say that the retardants will help restore vegetation after the fire is out . Maybe so , but fertilizers cause the same problems in forests that they do on farms : They wash into streams and ponds where they stimulate the growth of algae . The algae sucks up oxygen , so fish and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What hope is there that we 'll come to a more responsible approach before the burning gets any worse ? A : It 's complicated because it is n't only a matter of science . It 's also a matter of politics , attitudes , values-the whole maddening moral universe we inhabit . It 's also highly emotional because it involves our fears . So we make mistakes . But Nature gave us this task of managing fire . Burning things causes problems ; so does not burning things . Fire is complex . There 's no single , simple solution to the challenges it presents . We need to understand how fire works in our lives . That 's the only way we can make informed choices that are based on its potential for harm but also its potential for good . Sidebar Burning things causes problems . Sidebar So does not burning things . Sidebar Landscaping to Protect Your Home from Wildfires " Where homeowners see landscaping , fire fighters see fuel , " writes Maureen Gilmer in California Wildfire Landscaping . How you plan your lawn-the plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage them . Responsible landscaping is especially important as more of us make our homes near woods , beside golf courses and in outlying developments . Stephen J. Pyne , author of Tending Fire , says the same things that keep your home safe from wildfires will also help safeguard it from ice storms , hurricanes and tornadoes . " These steps are applicable no matter what threats you face in your geographical area , " Pyne says . * Make " lean , clean and green " your motto . Use plants sparingly , and keep them well trimmed and watered . Replace highly flammable vegetation-old evergreens , for example-with ones that are more fire-resistant . ( A local garden center can recommend alternatives. ) * Keep an 18-24-inch " safety zone , " an area in which nothing grows , around your house . * Use decorative gravel rather than wood mulch as a trim around gardens and next to your house . * Keep tree limbs trimmed 10 feet from the house . Fire can jump from a branch to the roof . Remove " ladder fuels " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treetops. * Mow grass frequently . Remove leaves , fallen branches and other debris . Remove dead leaves and needles from bushes . Clear gutters . Strip climbing plants from walls and fences . * Stack firewood 1OO feet from your house . * Keep gas grills and propane tanks at least 130 feet from your home , and clear a 10-foot area around them . * Use concrete , brick or gravel walkways , driveways , patios and other manmade features to stop fires from spreading . // <p>
