A Before and After Vision , creativity , and a lot of hard work transformed this Arlington , Virginia , bungalow . Photograph // It all started when a friend called to tell us about this great little dump of a house for sale on his street , " recalls Thornton Burnet . " He was right . The house was a pit , yet it did have a certain charm and wonderful natural light . " Immediately after visiting the site , the property was purchased . As co-owners of Contours &; Concepts , Inc. , Bruce K. Deutsch and Thornton make it their business to visualize the potential of a house and garden . They also know the power of those three little words-location , location , location  --  hat can turn realized potential into real profits . Bruce and Thornton had recently renovated another nearby fixer-upper into the finest house on the block and were looking for their next challenge . This modest cottage with its desirable location is in an older neighborhood in Arlington , Virginia . It also offered an easy commute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the transformation is complete . Literally , no stone in the garden was left unturned , and no wall , floor , or ceiling surface inside or out was left untouched . Because their firm specializes in both landscape and architectural services , they conceived the design of house and the garden in unison . Thornton , the landscape designer , was intent on maintaining as much of the garden as possible , while Bruce , the architect , focused on creating the optimum floor plan for the house . The lot was an average size for the neighborhood , measuring approximately 80 x 100 feet , so building up was the logical way to go . Their collaborative scheme provides three new bedrooms , two baths , and a turreted media room on the second floor and carves out a welcoming new foyer and stairway . To reinforce the integration of house and garden , a balcony off the master bedroom provides year-round views of the yard . Photograph Before , this tired little cottage was begging for a new owner .

Photograph ABOVE AND TOP : Amid the jumbled arrangement of the original structure , the kitchen had a cheerful little mudroom that provided the inspiration for a new sunroom , which extends at an angle off this service space . The room 's peaked ceiling creates the feel of a garden pavilion . Clustered windows line three walls . // Setbacks prohibited expansion along the front of the house , but the lines of the original front porch allowed for an octagonal tower to cantilever above . This whimsical element provides space for an upstairs sitting area and introduces a personality addressing the street . The original cottage was only 1,200 square feet , so even a full second floor would n't provide all the space they wanted . Enamored with the former mudroom , Bruce insisted on replicating this space off the kitchen as a sunroom . Thornton had ideas about how the room would interact with the garden . " The house faces east with the garden positioned to the south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This new wing is set at a 45-degree angle to maximize light and views . With a peaked ceiling and three walls of glass , the sunroom is a favorite seating area throughout the year . " In summer it 's green and shady , " says Thornton . " In winter , when the trees lose their leaves , it 's bright and sunny and the perfect spot for indoor plants . " When it came to renovating the original structure , Bruce knew instinctively which walls to remove in order to transform a jumble of boxy little rooms into a series of generous connected spaces . " The foyer is actually large for the modest size of this house , " explains Bruce . " But it 's designed to function as a real room , not just as a transitional space between the outdoors and indoors . During parties , guests often sit on the stairway . " STILL CHARMING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS Over the past seven decades , layers of junky siding and unsympathetic modifications had compromised the original structure . " We pulled down all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim , " says Bruce . " And then I discovered that what appeared to be a diamond in the rough had more character than we imagined . " Photograph The reconfigured first floor now features a welcoming foyer with such luxuries as a coat closet and a new powder room-and , of course , a stairway to the second floor . A Victorian umbrella stand offers a splendid introduction to the owners ' diverse collection of art and antiques . // These hidden assets provided inspiration throughout the remodeling . The fireplace was the obvious focal point in the living room . " I wanted the entire wall to read as a single element , which also helped to visually separate the living room and music area , " explains Bruce . To create that effect , wooden veneer panels are attached to the drywall to form a grid pattern with strips of stock lumber . Bruce designed the simple mantel and brackets in scale with the room . An existing brick fireplace was replaced with a refined Virginia soapstone hearth and surround . " The goal was to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Bruce . Photograph LEFT : An arched opening connected the original living and dining rooms . BELOW : Rather than creating a completely open floor plan , the renovated home has a series of adjoining rooms that work together . In place of a wall , graceful turn-of the-century mahogany columns provide a subtle sense of definition between the living room and a new music area . // In keeping with the style , new windows all feature true divided lights and traditional pane configurations . In the sunroom , new doublehung windows with a six-over-one arrangement , reminiscent of the old ones , are clustered in groups of three . Such traditional windows make for a more contemporary room that 's in keeping with the original house , while providing unobstructed views . " In the midst of the construction chaos , dust , and unexpected bills , we had to keep reminding ourselves that we were doing the right thing , " say Bruce and Thornton . When they learned the chimney was not structurally sound and was going to cost some ridiculous amount to rebuild , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bruce and Thornton wondered if their neighbor actually had ulterior motives when he suggested the two buy this property . They thought that maybe he wanted to increase the value of his property by having them redo this house . Granted , the friend may have viewed this project as a way to protect his investment , but Bruce and Thornton admit that the before and after property values in the neighborhood are almost as dramatic as the photographs .
