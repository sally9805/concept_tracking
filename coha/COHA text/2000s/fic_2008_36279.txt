The student of hatha yoga should practice in a solitary place , in a temple or a hermitage , an arrow-shot away from rocks , water , and fire . The hermitage should have a small door and no windows . It should be level with the ground and have no holes in the walls . It should be neither too high nor too long , and clean and free from insects . It should be laid daily with cow dung . <br>  --  H a t h a Yo g a P r a d i p i k a , c a . A D 1 4 0 0 <br> CHAP T E R 1 <br> My cell phone rang at 6:27 a.m. , ripping me out of a nightmare in which I was teaching a yoga class wearing only a bra and panties . <br> " Amanda ? Maxine here , " snapped a voice that was not the one I was hoping for . Strange how the fantasy  --  maybe it 's Matt  --  could hijack my mind before I was even awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . Oh , damn . I must have slept through my alarm . In exactly thirty-three minutes I was supposed to be at The Blissful Body Yoga Studio , substitute teaching the Monday Rise and Shine class . The regular teacher had called me late last night , croaking with laryngitis ; I knew that I was probably seventh or eighth on her list , but still , for an aspiring yoga teacher , not even certified yet , subbing for this class was a rare honor . And here I had almost slept right through it . <br> " Oh , hello , Maxine . " I tried to sound as professional as possible as I scrambled out of the tangled sheets and began groping around on the floor for my yoga pants . Of course it was n't Matt ; I 'd told Matt I never wanted to speak to him again . Maxine was my editor at Bigday Books , the publishers of the For Idiots : Guides to No-Risk Adventure series , which Maxine hoped would put her mark on the publishing industry . Her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through my yoga teacher training , which I was counting on to launch me into a Right Livelihood career in which I never again had to dodge calls from credit card collection agencies . I switched on the overhead , scrunching my eyes against the light . " What can I do for you ? " <br> " I have a very important question for you . " That was n't surprising ; all Maxine 's questions were very important . And almost all of them came extremely early in the morning . Bigday was based in Manhattan , and Maxine believed that " Pacific standard time " was just another excuse used by California writers to justify their chronic lack of work ethic . <br> " Lay it on me . " I picked up a turquoise camisole and sniffed the underarms . <br> " Amanda , what do you know about enlightenment ? " <br> " About what ? " I was pulling the shirt over my head as she spoke ; the phone must have slipped . Maxine could n't have just asked me about enlightenment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen months . The first one , RV Camping for Idiots , had forced me to spend my entire August traveling in a rented Winnebego from state park to state park , sandwiched each night between families with screaming toddlers watching Dora the Explorer on portable televisions . The second one  --  The California Winecountry for Idiots  --  had been particularly problematic given that I was in the middle of a yoga teacher training program in which the instructor had advocated drinking nothing but lemon water with cayenne and maple syrup . " I 'm sorry , I did n't quite catch that . " <br> " En-light-en-ment . " Her voice radiated impatience . " I know you 're into this whole yoga craze . So tell me : What is enlightenment ? " <br> " Well . . . " 6:31 . Would anyone notice if my socks did n't match ? " As I understand it , enlightenment is a state of blissful awareness that 's not dependent on any external circumstances . " I tucked the phone in the crook of my neck and tugged a comb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the understanding that you 're not separate from anything else in the universe : the trees , the sun , the  --  " <br> " Okay , I get it . My question is , is this something that people are looking for ? " <br> " Well , sure , I guess so . Some people , anyway . " I grabbed my rolled-up yoga mat and held the phone to my ear as I went down the creaking stairs , speaking softly so as not to wake up my housemate . Ishtar was annoyed enough about living with a writer ; she claimed that when I worked my mental vibrations seeped through the wall into her bedroom , disrupting her meditations on global harmony . In retaliation , whenever I sat down at my iBook she had begun playing her tablas and singing hymns to the Earth Goddess with great hostility and volume . " I mean , it 's really the whole point of the yoga practice . It 's  --  " <br> " So where would people go to get it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go anywhere . " Even I knew that . The books filled two whole rows in my bedside bookshelf , all with the same optimistic message : Be Here Now ; Wherever You Go , There You Are ; Present Moment , Wonderful Moment . " You can find it anywhere , like in the sound of a bell ringing , or a butterfly flapping its  --  " <br> " A-man-da ? ? " It was her ominous voice , the one that told me that if I was n't careful , I 'd be working at Starbucks again . " I 'm talking about travel that involves No-Risk Adventure . " <br> " Well , if you had to go somewhere  --  India , I guess . I mean , that 's where yoga came from . " I grabbed my battered mountain bike from the front hall and wheeled it out the door into a swirl of morning fog mixed with the salty wind off the San Francisco Bay . I groped for a metaphor she would relate to . " It 's like going to Paris to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " So if we wanted to do a book about this yoga thing that really set us apart from the competitors  --  something a cut above all this Yoga for This and Yoga for That  --  we should send our writer to India to get enlightened . Am I correct ? " <br> I slung my legs over my bike . My ancient Honda had died a few months ago  --  the engine finally seized up at 185,000 miles  --  and I had n't been able to afford a new one . And with my credit cards run up the way they were  --  charging yoga workshops , teacher trainings , an occasional dose of Xanax  --  no one would give me a loan . " Yes . I 'd say that 's correct . " If I pedaled hard , I could still be there on time . <br> " Ah . " She sounded supremely satisfied . " So , Amanda . This is my concept . We send you to India . You track down this enlightenment thing , tell our readers all the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . When you find it , you come back , and as soon as you write the book , you 'll get the rest of the advance . " <br> " Um . . . " I was feeling a bit slow on the uptake . I coasted down the hill , past the rows of Victorians with their windows still shuttered . I 'd been dreaming for years of going to India . Was Maxine actually offering to send me there to write . . . to write . . . " What is the book I 'm supposed to write , exactly ? " <br> Maxine let out a sigh . " Amanda . Have you not been listening to me ? The book is ' Enlightenment for Idiots . ' Are you on board with this ? Or do I need to find someone else ? " <br> Continues ...
