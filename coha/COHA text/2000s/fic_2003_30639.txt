The United States Steam Sloop Owanee Introduced to Lieutenant Ker Claiborne Within a Damaged Boiler The Silver-Filmed Eye of Uncle Ahasuerus Disagreement Relating to the Newly Elected President Contents of a Carpetbag Captain Trezevant Boards His Ship The black ship 's wedge of bow split hammered-iron river from a galvanized sky . Her topmasts tilted above a spiky undergrowth of spars and shears . Smoke streamed from her single funnel off over the gray-green flatness of the East River , merging at last with the sooty pall from the thousands of other ships and homes and factories of Manhattan . As Elisha Eaker dropped his boots into trampled mud , the smells of horse dung and coal ashes bloomed in his nostrils . He paid the hack off with a red-dog note , then stood coughing , holding a handkerchief to his lips as its wheels ground away . Was it wise , to venture this ? Was it really a way out ? Or was all pride and folly , the disordered imaginings of a feverish brain ? Eli was tall and young , with pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . He 'd put on the regulation full dress for the first time that morning . Epaulettes from Warnock and lace from Tiffany 's ; a cocked hat and silk stock and gold-striped pantaloons . Marine sentries in pomponed shakos and white gloves snapped to present arms as he reached the gate . He expected them to ask for a password , given the unrest in the city and , indeed , throughout the Republic this apprehensive spring . But they neither questioned nor hindered him , and after a moment he walked on , into the Brooklyn Navy Yard . The sloop 's masts loomed against the smoldering sky as he headed downhill past foundries and shops echoing with the clang of iron and the shouts of workmen . Her black sides towered from the murky bay . Even immobile , she looked somber and intimidating . But did he belong here ? Or was he only fooling himself ? He hesitated again , then pushed doubt away and marched up the gangway . His boot caught , and only the manrope saved him from flinging himself into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead rats and waterlogged dunnage . At the top he drew in a deep first breath of her , of the curious , deep , peculiar ship-redolence mingled and amalgamated of tar and brass polish , coal dust and slowly mortifying oak , of old food and the damp reek of packed-in men ; and beneath it all the sweet , smoky cured-tobacco aroma of the hempen rigging that lifted above him like a frozen whirlwind up into the murky sky . A stocky , bullet-headed petty officer aimed him a questioning scowl . Eli saluted him and said ,  --  Good day . My name is Elisha Eaker , and I am here to join your ship . Lieutenant Ker Claiborne , U.S. Navy , first lieutenant and acting executive officer of U.S.S. Owanee , had slept for three hours out of the last forty-eight . Two days before , the yard commander had ordered her coaled and provisioned to sail at short order , and her just-dismissed crew remustered from the concert saloons , cider stubes , and panel houses of Five Points and the Bowery . Captain Trezevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lips  --  a sardonic humor Ker would have shared , if he had not been so disquieted of late . He was in the teak-paneled wardroom , going over a bill of lading by the light of a gimbaled lamp , when one of the ship 's boys , looking , as usual , as if he expected to be caned , rapped at the jamb.  --  What is it , Jerrett ? Another of our lads back aboard drunk ?  --  No sir . Gunner Babcock 's compliments , and there 's a gen'lman on the quarterdeck to see you . A caulking hammer tapped somewhere . Ker dipped the pen ; held the back of his wrist against his pointed beard , pondering ; then etched a line in firm Spencerian . He glanced at the card the boy laid on his desk .  --  Tell the gunner I will be up directly . Then carry this to Mr. Glass , if you please . The boy vanished , and Claiborne rose , head brushing the varnished beams . He buttoned his coat and took his service cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bulkhead . Then turned the lamp down , and went up the companionway . The air on deck felt bracing after twenty-four months off West Africa . He 'd contracted the fever of the country off the Guinea coast , and it came calling with chills and ague when he drove himself too hard . As he most likely was just now . He touched his beard again , looking across the water not at the tropic continent but at his own country ; but instead of comfort , memory and apprehension chilled his heart . When Owanee had deployed , two years before , the nation had been quiet . But since she 'd returned , it seemed men had gone mad , lost their senses or been mastered by demons . Like the Gadarene swine , he thought , we stampede blindly toward an infinite and fatal abyss . Forward on the main deck , the gunners were scraping an amber paste of grease and varnish off the Dahlgren , flinging each bladeful into a tin bucket . A few yards aft , the boatswain was supervising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his silver whistle the hoistlines tautened . The mast stood upright , then lifted its heel just clear of the deck , searching in the wind like an old man 's uplifted and uncertain cane . Ker ran a critical eye over the rigging . He 'd apprenticed to the art at Annapolis . The old school ship Preble had been just seaworthy enough to jog about the Chesapeake , but her sail plan and fitting out had been classic sailing Navy . Summer cruises to the Caribbean and Mediterranean on the Plymouth added experience of levanters and hurricanes , but it was off the coast of Africa that he 'd become a master . Coal was scarce and dear , and Owanee had sailed through most of her service there . A curious tableau awaited him on the quarterdeck . A fair-haired young fellow , not badly made , but whose pale face and slack posture gave the impression of a life spent at ease , stood beside the ship 's gunner . He was in full dress , but wore no insignia of rank . Ker made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is uncertain .  --  Lieutenant Ker Claiborne , at your service .  --  My name is Elisha Eaker . Late of the firm of Eaker and Callo-well , of Manhattan .  --  Did you wish to see the purser , sir ? If it is a matter of business . Eaker hesitated , then drew a document from his sleeve . Ker was pondering it when a hoarse snort bellowed from the smokestack . A black cloud shot up , then hovered between mainmast and mizzen like a cloud of summer midges . Greasy flakes fluttered down like black snow .  --  That turd Hubbard 's doing , no doubt , and without the least concern for us topside , said the gunner angrily . Eaker glanced around , at the morose-looking seamen , the rows of heavy guns that lined the waist . He flicked a flake of soot from his sleeve .  --  Could we perhaps ... ? And Ker said ,  --  Certainly , sir . If you 'll accompany me below ? Eighty feet aft , a scraping clang sounded from within a well of darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cap with a broken bill emerged headfirst from beneath an iron casting that extended from the shadowy bilges to thick glass skylights thirty feet up . Their pearly glow illuminated a firm chin , determined lips , and deep-set eyes that peered from a face so sooted he resembled a blackface minstrel . Theodorus Hubbard , Owanee 's engineer , wiped his hands on a twist of cotton and pitched it overhand into a bucket . He braced his diminutive frame against a massive door . It slowly gathered momentum , then slammed shut with an iron boom that traveled the length of the space , dying away along catwalks , pumps , copper-shining piping , gutta-percha hose , glass tube-gauges of foaming water the color of melted opals . He said in a Connecticut twang ,  --  Pappy , what I want to know is , how you let everything go to hell in just two weeks . The burly man above him growled ,  --  Well , last I heard was they was going to jerk this heap o ' junk out of her and install one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' her back to sea .  --  Get them stokers on the rails . Watch the gauge when you cut in the crossover . Let 's fire her up , see if she holds . MacNail 's shout echoed above the inhaling roar of fans and the slap of leather blower belts . Two huge men with Irish faces ran toward them , boots hammering the limber boards laid over bilges black with a slurry of coal dust , ash , and seawater . They seized fascines of kindling , heaved them into the furnace , and tossed bucketfuls of kerosene after . MacNail hastily seated twelve huge iron nuts on the man-cover from which Hubbard had emerged , then began torquing them down with a wrench as the stokers snatched shovels off iron clips and threw coal like men possessed , raising a fine choking dust of black anthracite . Eli followed Claiborne down a shoulder-wide ladder into a low cabin that smelled of segar smoke , spar varnish , and the rotten-egg stench of sulphur fumigant . The lieutenant pointed to a chair . Eli aligned his cap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master of this vessel ?  --  The captain , you mean ? No . I am the first lieutenant and executive officer . Just appointed as Captain Trezevant 's second in command .  --  Might I see the captain ?  --  He is not aboard at present . Nor would it be proper for me to intrude your presence upon him without ascertaining your business here , and that in considerable detail . The lieutenant looked tired . Eli noticed he wore no sword , and began to doubt whether his own was not out of place . He nudged it around out of sight behind him as Claiborne said ,  --  Well , sir , let 's have another look at those papers . As he leafed through them , Eli found his glance arrested by two small gleaming eyes that stared back at him from a fiddle-boarded bookcase . In the dimness he gradually made out that they were set in a tiny wizened face . He stood to examine what he took for a stuffed curio , then put out a hand . And staggered back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  His name 's Auguste , said Claiborne as the monkey hopped out , drawing a minuscule paw across its mouth and chattering angrily at the New Yorker.  --  Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin , to give him his complete honors . We took him and a few of his compatriots aboard at Porto Praya . As the days passed they gradually grew fewer , but we were hard put to tell where they 'd gone . Finally we discovered this fellow here was pitching the smaller ones overboard at night to watch them swim . The animal leapt to the floor and scrabbled up the companionway . Claiborne turned the documents over , scanning each with every appearance of interest . Finally he cleared his throat .  --  I hope you will not take it amiss if I observe I have never heard of the New York Naval Militia .  --  Not at all . Eli wrenched his mind away from the ape , how disturbingly its shadowy leer had parodied a human smile .  --  It 's a volunteer body , recently organized among the better sort of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slavocratic conspiracy put our temper to the test .  --  Should the what ?  --  The renegade Carolinians who feel disposed to insult our flag . Claiborne said gravely ,  --  You must pardon me ; I have been absent the country , and am unfamiliar with the political cant of the moment .  --  You must know that the Deep South states have rejected all compromise , and set up a rump legislature at Montgomery .  --  I read the journals , sir ; and as far as I know , no offer of concession has been tendered them as yet . But let us lay that difficult topic aside . Your purpose in visiting Owanee ? Eli felt steadily less comfortable . The gravely courteous officer before him was plainly from south of the Mason-Dixon . The fellow 's eyes , too , were unsettling , the same pale bleached blue as the noon sky in August .  --  I 'm here to help in any way you may find convenient . I wo n't require pay .  --  No pay , eh ? It 's true we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  These reflect attendance at Harvard University . What degree did you take ?  --  I was permitted to withdraw after two years , for reasons of health .  --  You appear robust enough to me . Eli said carefully ,  --  Just now I feel well .  --  Do you have anything resembling experience at sea ?  --  My family 's been in shipping for three generations . I 've also spent some considerable time aboard Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt 's private yacht . Claiborne 's eyebrows rose .  --  I see . Aboard his private yacht . You know Mr. Vanderbilt intimately , I take it ?  --  Not intimately , but well enough to speak to . The exec mused over this for a moment more , then reached for a bell .  --  Ask the bo's'n to step in , he said to Jerrett 's apprehensive countenance .  --  Your qualifications would not go so far as a mate 's ticket , would they , Mr. Eaker ?  --  I 'm afraid not . I 'm willing to learn , though . And as I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap at the doorjamb , and the exec motioned in a spare , spry old warrant with a furrowed brow , bright black eyes , and a preposterous forked gray-and-tobacco beard that hung below his waist . Claiborne introduced him as Josiah Girnsolver , Owanee 's boatswain . He told Girnsolver their visitor had alluded to experience in yachts , and that his qualifications as a sailing officer were under discussion . The old man turned his head slowly to the left , then to the right , as if easing a stiff neck . He pulled up a trowser-leg , revealing the top of a prickly-looking red wool sock . Then said in a Down East accent , scratching his ankle thoughtfully ,  --  Wal , let 's say the cap'n tells ya to furl sails . What d' ya say to carry that out , now , sor ? Eli cleared his throat , calling on Mnemosyne to assist him .  --  To furl sails . Well , first I should call away the men . Um , then , command them to go aloft .  --  " Aloft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite so . When they have gained the rigging , get the topmen aloft ; then man my clew jiggers  - -   - -   Buntlines and clew jiggers ?  --  I was about to say , buntlines as well . When all men are in position , I tell them to furl away . Then when all is complete , to lay down from aloft , I suppose . Claiborne prompted ,  --  And the downbooms ?  --  I should tell them to lay in the downbooms . They regarded him noncommittally . The warrant fingered his whistle , which hung from his neck on a lanyard of ornately embroidered marline . He said ,  --  Say ye 're under way by the wind on a starboard tack , under all sail . What d' ya do if the wind hauls aft , as the officer of the deck ? Eli coughed into his fist , fighting both nervousness and the familiar rising tickle in his throat .  --  Maintaining the same course ? I should first ease off sheets . Get a pull of the braces . Man the halyards on deck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ah , make sure the boom , I forget the name of it , but make sure it 's ready for coming back in . Claiborne asked him ,  --  How many pieces of gear does a fully rigged ship need ? He sat struck dumb . There would be hundreds , no , thousands of fittings and parts from truck to keel . Then he smiled .  --  Why , none , of course . If she needed any , she would not be fully rigged . The first officer favored him with a lifted eyebrow .  --  He 's got that right , at least . Well , Boats ?  --  ' E do n't know the commands , sor.  --  Granting that , his unfamiliarity with service phraseology.  --  Well , he 's sort of got the idear . We maught could train him up , if he was willing to work . But a verbal examination ai n't no proof of his effectiveness on deck . And a yacht ai n't no warship . The exec turned to Eli and cleared his throat .  --  Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ?  --  Thank you , no . Feel free , if you like .  --  Bo's'n ?  --  Thanks , sor , b'lieve I will indulge . The two navy men lifted the globe of the lamp to light their cheroots . The lieutenant settled back on the settee , puffing out a cloud of rum-cured Cuban as the clank and drag of a massive chain reverberated through the overhead .  --  Are you certain you wish to subject yourself to sea-discipline , Mr. Eaker ? The rigors and subordination of a man-of-war are quite a comedown from the leisure of civilian existence .  --  I shall endeavor to do so to the best of my ability .  --  So you present yourself as a gentleman volunteer , is that what we are to understand ? Serving on a pro bono basis , with no allowances of any sort ?  --  That is correct , sir . The exec cleared his throat .  --  An irregular mode of proceeding ; but these seem to be irregular times . The final decision must be the captain 's . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose this : you take over the Forecastle Division ; and since our gunnery officer has left for Mississippi , assume that position as well , at least temporarily . I 'll ask Mr. Duycker to be your bear-leader . That is , to break you in on deck , and give you such guidance as you may need to find your footing . Eli recalled the black weapons couched on the deck above , the half-naked men slaving over them like acolytes of a heathen temple . He had not anticipated quite so responsible a task so soon . But this did not seem to be the time to offer demurrals . Claiborne waited , then went on ,  --  Bo's'n , have him put into Mr. Minter 's stateroom , if you please . Then bring him back for luncheon , and we 'll take his measure in the mess . His cabin was soberingly small , dark , and dank , so much so he suspected he was being shown a punishment cell by way of further test ; but he said nothing , simply nodded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passageway when a smear-faced little fellow in dirty clothes shoved past . Eli started to protest , then closed his mouth again . He brushed smut off his coat and continued after Girnsolver , who was rambling to the end of what was obviously a well-worn tale about Captain Porter and the old Essex 's battle with the Cherub and Phoebe off Valparaiso in March of ' 14.  --  Y 're joinin ' a good ship here , sor . Not tae much Andrew Miller and sichlike pimpiness , and the prog 's first-rate . We 're supposed to go inta ordinary , after this long trick in Africky , but scuttlebutt is they 're sending us down to deal with these here se-cessionists . Since we 're about the only steamer left around .  --  The rest of the fleet 's overseas , I understand .  --  Yes sor , in the Med or off Brazil . If something goes to pop , we 're the ones t'will have to pull the chestnuts . Girnsolver opened another door , gestured him through .  --  Mind you use the right fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply as a Manhattan gentleman , interested in joining the sea service . Mindful that his stay was uncertain , Eli merely bowed as , one after the other , the exec introduced the men around the dining table . The paymaster and purser was a supercilious-looking Israelite named Judah Glass . The smutty boy who 'd jostled Eli in the corridor had become a small-framed but fully grown man , face scrubbed , re-attired in a civilian sack coat and tie . He was introduced as Mr. Theodorus Hubbard . A magnificently mustachioed officer in a blue army-style uniform and gold shoulder knots was presented as Lieutenant Robert Schuyler , commanding Owanee 's detachment of marines . Nicholas Duycker was a lean , graying master ; he favored Eli with a Voltairean smirk as they shook hands . Eli recognized the man Claiborne had appointed to " bear-lead " him . A corpulent , brandy-breathed fellow well past youth rose grudgingly to the name of Doctor Alphaeus Steele . There remained two very young midshipmen , Eddowes and Thurston , and three empty places . When the proprieties were satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short grace .  --  Well , and what is the mood of the city today ? Dr. Steele asked Eli as an aged , bent Negro in a rusty frock coat slowly passed from one to the next , pouring out a tablespoon of claret to each glass . He noted the others awaiting his lead as guest . He raised the glass to his lips , though he did not actually drink . Instead of answering he said ,  --  And this man ? Has he a name ? Claiborne looked puzzled .  --  I believe I have introduced everyone .  --  Not our sable friend here , said Eli , turning in his seat to face the Negro . The table quieted . The old man had stopped short , on his way out with the carafe , but did not speak . Looking up , Elisha saw the far orb turned on him now . A silver-filmed sphere , immobile , obviously blind , it yet gave the impression of prternatural observation . An elderberry mark was tattooed on each temple in the shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to points , but successively , long yellow teeth alternating with mere pegs . A chill hackled Eli 's spine .  --  We call him Uncle Ahasuerus , said Claiborne quietly .  --  He does not answer you because he can not speak . He was mutilated some years ago by the Kroomen , his own tribe . Why , we do not know . When we took him off a Brazil-bound slaver he indicated his desire to stay with us , in the capacity wherein you see him . He is Commander Trezevant 's  --  is the phrase fidus Achates ? Eli nodded . The reference was to Vergil ; Achates had been the faithful companion who accompanied Aeneas on his wanderings . The steward left , vanishing into some back pantry . Dr. Steele rumbled his throat free and said again ,  --  What news from the city ? Is the mayor still offering to secede , along with his friend Jeff Davis ? A chuckle ran around the table . Eli flushed , reminded of the corrupt Fernando Wood 's proposal that New York should leave what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain its hundreds of millions in Southern business .  --  The city 's overwhelmingly loyal . My father says the price of gold has found its level  - -  An etheric current seemed to run around the table , as at the sances popular in some circles . Duycker drawled ,  --  Your father would n't be  - -   - -   He is Micah Eaker.  --  Who is ... ? said Claiborne , looking from one to the other .  --  A Manhattan financier , Hubbard said darkly , helping himself to a tureen of Lynnhaven oysters . Eli caught his glance ; the envy in it was unmistakable . Steele hoisted his eyebrows .  --  Not merely a " financier , " my dear Hubbard . Micah Eaker sitteth at the right hand of Vanderbilt and Astor.  --  One fellow who wo n't cavil at the mess bill , at least , Glass muttered .  --  Moreover , he is one of the leading lights of Republicanism in the Empire State . And you , sir ? Do I sense you too worship at that dusky shrine ? Eli helped himself to the stewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warm , and the hot food did n't help ; he felt sweat break under the heavy wool uniform .  --  I am a Republican . Not from any sense of righteousness , I am afraid . My grandfather traded to Africa and , I regret to say , trafficked in helpless men and women , stolen from their homes .  --  A trade which has not yet ended , Glass put in.  --  We have just returned from a long patrol on the Gulf of Guinea , and had several encounters with illegal blackbirders . Most of whose masters , interestingly enough , hail from New England . Steele pressed .  --  You are a Lincolnian , sir ?  --  Since hearing him , yes , I number myself among those friendly to him .  --  You 've met the president ? Schuyler said . The marine had a scratchy , damaged-sounding voice , and touched his collar as he spoke .  --  I heard him speak at Cooper Union , when he began his quest for the nomination . Duycker said contemptuously ,  --  You support the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mr. Darwin would style  --  how would you put it , Hubbard  --  our " anthropoid cousins " ? Claiborne cleared his throat in warning . But Eli replied , as coolly as he could ,  --  Not at all . It 's true he 's taller than the average , but he 's not the outlandish character such pandering rags as the Herald make him out to be . Duycker smiled loftily , started to respond , but the exec said sharply ,  --  Politics are out of order in the mess , gentlemen . Find some other topic .  --  Such as the impossibility of putting to sea with these wretched boilers , the engineer said . The others sighed . Eli essayed a chuckle .  --  We can still sail , ca n't we ? Hubbard glared .  --  Useless top-hamper , and a lot of useless hands to pull it about . Throw it all overboard , and fill the hull with coal .  --  Mr. Hubbard is a mechanical enthusiast , Claiborne explained .  --  But sails do not break down , Theo . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spar . But when her engine breaks down , a steamer is helpless .  --  A ship should have two , then .  --  That really is going beyond the bounds of good taste , said Glass silkily.  --  We should be manned with nothing but grease monkeys and Paddy stokers , and sleep with lumps of bituminous stuffed into our ticking . They chortled as the ancient Negro , glaring out from his unclouded eye , took off the soup plates and brought baked cod in thin , flaky crust , asparagus , hot scones and sweet butter , and sliced burgaloos for dessert . By the time they sipped hot coffee ground from beans purchased in the Bay of Benin , Dr. Steele was dilating on a remarkable flower that he had observed in Martinique .  --  The mere scent of which can induce vomiting . If inhaled in a closed room , I was told , it would induce death in persons of weakened constitution ; by reason of which , it has been implicated in numerous mercy murders of the aged and infirm . And the unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not the thoughts , of all . After luncheon Claiborne put him together with the gunner , one Thomas Babcock , a heavyset , saturnine , bald-headed warrant , or senior petty officer , old enough to be his father , if not his grandfather ; in fact the same man Eli had first saluted on stepping aboard . Babcock , who seemed to be in a bad humor , carried a colt , a short length of braided manila that he continually slapped against his thigh . He led Eli on a tour of their demesne . Owanee carried five guns . To port and starboard midships crouched four old-style thirty-two-pounders , grim Jaganaths on oaken carriages with lignum vitae trucks . The largest , though , was the single huge nine-inch Dahlgren . It was mounted forward , but iron racers on deck made it trainable to either broadside . The gunners were working on it , scraping off the last of a greasy coating . Babcock explained that they were preparing the metal for varnishing . Gradually Eli noted that their apparent leader was a huge man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Is he a member of the crew ?  --  Hanks ! Stand to attention . The sailor froze , half turned at the warrant 's peremptory summons . For the merest fraction of a second Eli caught a red-eyed gaze , direct and full of what looked very much like hatred . Then , quick as the snap of a caplock , a blank mask took its place . The sailor laid aside an iron handspike , straightened from his work , and came to attention in front of them .  --  Calpurnius Hanks , sir .  --  Mr. Eaker did n't address you , boy , said Babcock threateningly.  --  You keep that mouth shut till you hear an order , or you and me are going to have a falling-out . The sailor blinked ; his mouth compressed , then sank back into a quiescent line . Eli did not count himself as a small man , but Hanks looked twice as wide . He examined the rounded head , the small , protruding ears , curled as if they 'd been given a hard twist in infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the skin . His lips were fleshier than a white man 's and , with the heavy , outthrust jaw , projected the lower half of his face forward . Deep brown irises deepened to a black pool , the whites like old ivory . Eli 's glance dropped to large , curled hands , then to big , blacked , square-toed boots .  --  He calls himself a freedman , said Babcock , slapping the colt into his palm . Eli noted a tattooed American flag on the back of his hand .  --  But I think he 's an escaped slave . He tried to imagine the black in rags , fleeing , the way Liza jumped across the ice floes in Mrs. Stowe 's play . He could not catch the man 's gaze . It floated beyond him , fast to the distant line of river and bay .  --  Your position aboard , Hanks ? Eli asked him . The wide lips hesitated .  --  Second gun cap'n on numbah one , sir .  --  Are you truly an escaped slave ?  --  Fugitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He nodded . A good answer to a question he realized now he should not have asked .  --  Very well , Hanks . You can go back to your work . They descended from there to inspect the magazines , arms lockers , and departmental records . Eli insisted on an inventory . Two hours later , he realized it was well he had . Eight of the ship 's revolvers were missing .  --  Mr. Minter did leave with a heavy carpetbag , Babcock said darkly .  --  I had best report this loss to Mr. Claiborne.  --  You think he 'll mind ? Eli frowned .  --  What do you mean by that ? Babcock met his eye , glowering.  --  Sir , we enlisted men ca n't resign . That 'd be desertion . But the officers are let to walk off whenever they like . If I might speak frankly , there 's others still aboard more secesh than otherwise .  --  I will not countenance criticism of the officers , Eli said stiffly.  --  Excuse me . Neither gun room nor wardroom held Claiborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now cooler beneath the threat of a squall , did he see him by the gangway , peering through a telescope . When he came up the first lieutenant clapped it shut .  --  A word , sir .  --  Your servant , Mr. Eaker . He explained about the revolvers , and Babcock 's suspicion as to their fate . Claiborne 's lips tightened , but he said only ,  --  I will enter that information in the log . Now , if you please , stand away from the quarterdeck . Two men were walking toward them down the pier . One was in undress uniform , a lean aristocrat with a raptorial nose and weather-beaten complexion . The other was stouter , black bearded , in a steel-pen coat and top hat . He gestured expansively with both arms as they paused at the brow . The boatswain 's pipe shrilled.  --  Owanee , arriving , Midshipman Thurston shouted to the quartermaster . A pendant snapped down from the leaden sky , leaving the Stars and Stripes to rustle and flap alone in a sudden cold breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a keen glance aloft , then down the main deck . As he returned Claiborne 's salute his gaze marked Eaker , then returned to his companion as the latter resumed speaking .  --  That 's the captain ? Elisha asked , when the new arrivals had vanished below .  --  Commander Parker Bucyrus Trezevant , Owanee 's commanding officer .  --  And the other ?  --  A Mr. Fox , a former naval man who I understand now runs a woolen mill . He is connected with the Blairs . Something of a politician , I suspect . Eli said ,  --  I 'd like to step ashore now , if no one minds . Is that all right ?  --  That is generally phrased in the service , " Request permission to go ashore , sir . " Claiborne smiled , making a jest of it rather than a rebuke , and Elisha found himself liking the Southerner .  --  You will not stay the evening ? Theodorus is not a bad hand at the harmonium , and the captain carries a baritone . We also play various and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a rendezvous with one of the softer sex . Eli flushed , recalling who actually waited for him , and what he had to tell him . The thought made his palms sweat . For a moment he was tempted to confide in Claiborne , perhaps ask his advice . But at last all he said was ,  --  I 'm expected home . Facing the old flag , he contemplated its bloody scarlet and empyrean blue , the scatter of stars , each separate , yet conveying in their massed ranks power and unanimity . Could it be possible that the " mystic chords of memory , " as the new president had styled them in his inaugural address , could be sundered ? He could not believe it . The erring sisters would return , once a firm hand was shown . But by then he 'd be free . One way or another , surely he would be free . Descending the gangway , he vanished into the blue evening .                @ @ @ @ @
