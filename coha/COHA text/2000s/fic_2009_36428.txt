prologue <p> The cast-iron railing wobbled in his hand as he climbed the porch steps . He nearly fell over . After three tries , he decided the doorbell did n't work . The screen door would n't give , so he stripped off a glove and rapped on the aluminum frame . Paint the color of pea soup was peeling off the face of the inside door . <p> A cold drop of rain leaked through the awning over his head and splatted on the back of his neck . He put a hand to his neck and looked up as another drop splashed on his cheek . " Shit , " he said , taking a step back and pulling his camouflage jacket tight around the package tucked within . <p> He looked down the street . Not a person in sight . Two Fords , a Chrysler , and his Chevy pickup truck waited at the curb . A single porch light flickered wanly in the dusk . Two doors down , charring from a fire blackened one side of the house , and wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked down . Brown stains pocked the concrete porch , down the three steps , and along the walk to the street . The stains seemed to grow bigger as they neared the curb . He hoped they were n't blood . <p> He rapped again . Dammit , he thought , I knew I should have just sent it the usual way . Four hours down to this shithole city and now I got ta wait around ? How the hell does the guy work in this dump ? There 's a darkroom in there ? He looked at his watch . If he could get this done in the next hour he would still have time to visit one of the Windsor clubs before heading home . <p> He heard something moving inside , then footsteps on the other side of the door . He swallowed hard and took another step back . Just a delivery , he thought . Just leave the thing and go . <p> The door eased open a crack . He smelled cabbage and cigarettes . A woman 's pale round face appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wearing nothing but a flannel shirt that drooped to her knees . <p> " What ? " she said . <p> " Riddle . Got something for Charley . " <p> He slipped the manila envelope out from under his coat . <p> " Riddle ? You a joker ? " <p> She had an accent he did n't recognize . Jesus Christ , he thought , is she going to understand a word I say ? <p> " It 's my name . Is Charley here ? " <p> The envelope was wrapped in tape and rubber bands . She looked at it with contempt . <p> " No Charley . We do n't want no delivery . " <p> " This is the address he gave me . " He glanced at the address plate nailed to the brick . " Cecil Avenue , right ? " <p> A man 's voice called out from inside . " Magda ! " <p> She yelled at him in her language . He barked something else , sounding closer now , and she stormed away , leaving the inside door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood barefoot in a pair of paint-stained sweatpants and a gray T-shirt that said Property of Detroit Lions . A single brow overhung his dark , sunken eyes . He held the door with one hand and kept the other behind his back . <p> " What you want ? " <p> " I was supposed to bring this for Charley . " <p> " Charley ? " The man almost smiled , then decided against it . " Jarek . " <p> " Jarek ? " Riddle chuckled nervously . " Jarek , Charley . Got it . Can I leave this for him ? " <p> The man shifted his weight from his left foot to his right , keeping his one hand hidden . Riddle tried not to look at it . <p> " You are from up north ? " the man said . <p> " Yes , sir . About four hours . " <p> The man stared at Riddle for a moment . " Why do you wear army jacket ? " he said . " Are you in military ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no sir . This is for hunting . Deer , rabbits , you know . " <p> " Aha . You are a killer then . Did you bring gun ? " <p> " My gun ? Oh , no sir . That 's locked up at home , yes sir . " <p> The man tilted his head slightly . " Would you like to come in ? " <p> " Thank you , but no , I really have to be going . Got a long haul back . Got other deliveries to make , you know . Sorry . " <p> " Other deliveries ? " The man leaned forward . " What other deliveries ? " <p> Riddle glanced down the street again . Still not a soul . The last light of afternoon was nearly gone . " Nothing , " he said . " I just have to get back . " <p> " Jarek is not here . " <p> " No ? " <p> " No . Not here anymore . " <p> " I see . Well . " Riddle tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you know where I can find him ? " He wished he had n't asked the question the second it left his lips . <p> " Jarek will not be back . You can leave it with me . " <p> The man pushed open the screen door with his hidden hand . The hand held an unlit cigarette . Riddle gave the man the envelope . <p> " OK , then , " Riddle said . " You 'll send it back to the usual place ? " <p> The man slammed the door without another word.Copyright 2009 by Bryan Gruley <p> one <p> You can never look into their eyes . Not once . Not for a second . Not if you 're a goaltender , like me . Because the guy shooting the puck wants you to look there . Then he 'll glance one way and shoot the other , or he 'll draw your eyes up just as he snaps the puck between your legs . Or he 'll lock on you just long enough to remind you that he knows exactly what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're just wishing and hoping that you 'll guess right . That you 're not at all in control . <p> Then you 're dead . <p> It was nearly midnight . I was tending the hockey goal at the south end of the John D. Blackburn Memorial Ice Arena . And I was yelling for help . Soupy backpedaled across the rink to give me some . It looked like he 'd make it just in time to cut off the other team 's winger when his skate blade caught a gash in the ice and he went flying . His helmet , an old three-piece Cooper held together by skate laces and friction tape , bounced off of his head and went skittering into the boards . <p> " Fuck me ! " he shouted . <p> Boynton sidestepped Soupy and the helmet and veered to the center of the ice , heading my way , alone . He was tall and lean , dressed all in black , and he kept his head up as he crossed the blue line , looking for my eyes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , from the back of his stick to the front . My team was up , 2-1 . Less than a minute remained in the game . My left hand , steamy inside my catching glove , whacked once against my belly , involuntarily , and shot out to my side , open and ready . My right arm pressed the bottom edge of my goalie stick against the sandpaper ice . I dropped my squat an inch , dug the inner toe of my right skate into the ice , and glided back six inches , a foot . I tucked my head into my neck . The thin slick of sweat beneath my mask stung my cheeks . I blinked , hard . <p> I did n't want to be there . In a drafty hockey rink reeking of refrigerant . Late . In a two-stoplight town clinging to the southeastern tip of a frozen lake in northern lower Michigan . I 'd left the place years before , a failure , intending never to return . Now I was back , against my weak will , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the associate editor of the Pine County Pilot , circulation 4,733 , published every day but Sunday . By night I tended goal in the Midnight Hour Men 's League , surrounded by men I 'd known as boys . In between I waited for something to change my life , to get me out of Starvation Lake again . That 's what goalies do . They wait . <p> When Boynton had closed to fifteen feet , I felt him drop his right shoulder as if to shoot . Just then , the puck bounced on something  --  a shaving of ice , a sliver of wood  --  and tottered on an edge . I glimpsed the chipped scarlet paint of a logo on the underside . I dropped to one knee and flung my stick forward , catching just enough of the wobbling puck to flop it back over Boynton 's stick blade . It trickled behind him , and Soupy , bareheaded , swooped in and golfed it clear . <p> Boynton kept coming , though . I was trying to get to my feet when his stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mask . A shock of pain tore through my jawbone and rippled down my neck . Boynton 's knee speared my chest and I toppled over backward , my head bouncing on the ice as he fell on me . The smells of snuff and hops and sweat and tape filled my nostrils . I could hear a whistle shrieking , again and again . I opened my eyes . Boynton 's face was two inches away , a grin beneath dark eyes . " Lucky fuck , " he spat before I blacked out . <p> My wait was over . <br> <p> The needle punctured the skin along my jawbone and I dug my fingernails into the soft wood of Leo 's workbench as he stitched me . I had tried to numb the left side of my face with a fistful of snow , but the pinpricks stung anyway . The cut took six stitches to close . <p> " Thanks , Leo , " I said . The air in the big steel shed behind Blackburn Arena was sweet with gasoline . I sipped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging from the high ceiling . Leo moved out of the light to toss his stitching needle into a wastebasket . It pinged on one of his empty 7-Up bottles . <p> " Try to be more careful , " Leo said , emerging into the light again . " You boys are n't boys anymore . " <p> For something like thirty years , Leo Redpath had maintained the rink 's compressors and ice scrapers and Zamboni machine . He performed the odd carpentry and plumbing chores that kept the dressing rooms , snack bar , and restrooms in working order . Mostly he kept to himself , content to tinker in his shed and tend to the Zamboni he affectionately called Ethel . And although Leo was no doctor , his workbench sometimes doubled as an operating table for players who did n't want to bother with the local clinic . Leo had been doing it so long that he barely left scars anymore . <p> " See the game tonight ? " I said . <p> " I never watch , " Leo said . <p> I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could make out his wide , hunched-over shape shuffling around in the shadows surrounding Ethel . " You do n't see hockey like that too often in Starvation Lake . " <p> " I 'm sure no truer words were ever spoken , " he said . <p> " It 's that deceptive speed , eh , Trap ? " The voice came from the other end of the shed . Soupy walked in with a beer in one hand and two more dangling from a plastic six-pack holder . " We 're even slower than we look . " <p> It was one of his favorite lines , and he laughed at it , by himself . <p> Leo stepped out from behind Ethel . " Well , if it is n't Sonja Henie , " he said . " Was that a triple salchow that landed you on your derriere ? " <p> " Derriere ? " Soupy said . " Derri-fucking-aire ? Have n't we told you like eight million times to speak English around here ? I think the word you 're looking for is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell is Sonja Henie ? " <p> " Leo did n't watch , " I said . Talking hurt . <p> " True , " Leo said . " But I did catch a glimpse while carrying a box of Junior Mints to the snack bar . " <p> I jumped down from the workbench . My teeth rattled when I landed . " Well , then , maybe you noticed whether Soupy punched Boynton 's ticket on his way past ? " <p> " Blow me , Trap , " Soupy said . He stood a head taller than me , long and lanky in a blue denim overcoat with the words " Starvation Lake Marina " encircling an anchor embroidered over the left breast . Thick blond curls furled out from under his red woolen cap . " Gave you a chance to shine . You ought to thank me . " <p> " I would have but I was unconscious . " <p> I finished my beer , tossed the can at the wastebasket , missed , and motioned for one of Soupy 's beers . Leo picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and battery , " Soupy said . " You poke-check him , he runs you over . " While I was out cold , as Soupy explained , Boynton threatened to punch a referee , who threw him out of the game . " The bastard probably did n't mean to knock you out . Or who knows , maybe he did . " Soupy took a long pull on his beer . " He probably did n't like your editorial . " <p> I had no idea Soupy read editorials . " Probably not . " I looked around the shed . Leo had disappeared behind Ethel again . " We have a meeting tomorrow . " <p> " With Teddy boy ? " Soupy asked . <p> " And his lawyer . " <p> " His asshole lawyer , Trap . " <p> " Of course . " <p> Soupy touched his beer to the side of his head . " Try to keep your head up this time , huh ? " <p> " Quiet , please . " Leo was trying to listen to the police scanner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping him company on slow nights . We heard some crackling and some beeps , then the voice of the dispatcher , Darlene Esper . She was talking with a deputy on his way to Walleye Lake . A snowmobile had washed up onshore . <p> " Christ , " I said . It was probably nothing . But every local over the age of fifty had a police scanner next to the bed , on the garage workbench , or on the shelf over the washing machine , and they 'd all be talking about that snowmobile on Walleye Lake at Audrey 's Diner the next morning . I grabbed Leo 's rotary phone and dialed the sheriff ' s department . One of the perks of being associate editor of the Pilot was knowing that number by heart . Darlene answered . <p> " Deputy Esper , " I said . " Gus Carpenter . " I hoped for a chuckle . Darlene and I had grown up next door to each other . Our mothers had finally given up trying to marry us . So had Darlene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about the sled ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " You better get out there . Sheriff 's out there . " <p> " Dingus ? Why , is there an all-you-can-eat buffet ? " <p> " Just go , Gus . " <p> I lingered on the phone  --  her voice always got me that way  --  but she 'd already hung up . I zipped up my parka , fished out my truck keys . " Leo , thanks for the embroidery , " I said . He did n't answer . <p> " Ca n't keep away from her , can you ? " Soupy said . <p> " Good skate , Soup , " was all I said . <p> As I stepped into the night , I heard him call out : " Mrs. Darlene Esper  --  sweetest ta-tas in Starvation Lake .
