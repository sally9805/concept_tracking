Chapter One It had been ten years since Princess Teresa of Corsaria had driven a car . Looking out the window of her suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington , D.C. , this evening , she felt a pang of envy for the people on Pennsylvania Avenue below . Walking , driving , even just standing on street corners ... none of them realized how lucky they were to be able to go outside without anyone calling it a security risk . Princess Teresa , who had spent the first twenty-one years of her life as Tess McDougall , of Liberty , Ohio , remembered what that was like . Until she was nineteen years old and went to school in England on an exchange program , no one had taken particular notice of anything she did . Until her classmate Philippe Carfagni had asked her out on a date , that is . Then , suddenly , everyone was interested . Because Philippe Carfagni also happened to be the crown prince of Corsaria , a tiny but fashionable principality off the coast of Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads from all over Europe , and seemed every inch the fairy-tale-come-to-life , with the handsome prince whisking the princess off to his five-hundred-year-old castle by the sea . She should have known that the rocky coast - beautiful but treacherous - was a harbinger of things to come . Tess had thought she was in love with Philippe , she really did , but it had n't taken her long to realize that she had been more in love with the idea of being in love with a prince . And her idea of a prince had clashed terribly with the spoiled , womanizing , reckless reality . That recklessness had led to Philippe 's demise a year and a half ago . On a ski trip in Switzerland , he had challenged his bodyguard to a race down a dangerous mountainside . Almost immediately , a small avalanche had swept them both away , leaving Tess the beloved widowed princess of a country in mourning . Had it not been for Philippe 's younger sister , Maria , Tess would have returned home to the United States as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't , so magazines and tabloids still found her newsworthy when there was n't a more significant royal to write about . Even more difficult was the fact that she was always surrounded by security advisors telling her that it was n't safe to go to that neighborhood , or that shop was n't secure , or that restaurant was too open , and so on . Their intentions were good , she knew . That was what made it so hard for her to disregard their advice or tell them all to just leave her alone . " Ma'am ? " the crisp voice of Tess 's private secretary , Clara , cut into her thoughts . " I 'm sorry . " Tess took one last , longing look at the street below , sighed and turned back to Clara . " What were you saying ? " " That the Boden Foundation just phoned and said that tonight 's function raised approximately one point three million dollars for breast cancer research . " " Wonderful ! " Tess clapped her hands together . " So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closet and took off the **35;328;TOOLONG designer dress . It was gorgeous and impractical - like so many things in her life these days . " You still have other engagements , " Clara pointed out . " A meeting with the ambassador - " Tess stiffened , remembering her last meeting with the ambassador . He 'd spent two hours propositioning her . " - the opening of the Corsarian designer Luigi 's new store ... " Luigi had tried to attach her name to his for years , and had earned a lot of money with his less-than-honest business practices . She did n't want to endorse him in any way . " Let 's cancel . " She stopped in the middle of hanging her dress . " And the ambassador , too . Just tell them I 'm ill . " She slipped into a pair of soft silk pajamas . " Very well , ma'am . If you 're certain . " " I am . " She finished hanging the dress and strode across the room to her bed , throwing the sheets back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile on the calendar this week ? " " Just a fund-raiser for the Cats in Need charitable foundation - an association that brings attention and respect to lesser known breeds of cats . " Tess could see the headlines already : Pampered Princess Pampers Pets . Or worse . " I definitely feel a cold coming on . Let 's cancel everything for the next week . " " Yes , ma'am , right away . " With one last dubious look , Clara gathered her pad and pen and left the room . Tess watched her go , then turned off the light and lay down in bed , her heart pounding . She could n't keep living this life anymore . Cats in Need , spoiled clothing designers , lecherous diplomats ... this was n't how she 'd envisioned her life . She wanted to be useful to people , to genuinely help and contribute to society . Once , she had aspired to be an elementary school teacher . That , she realized now , would probably have been a more fulfilling life . She tossed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out of bed and going back to the window . Cars still rumbled along the avenue and a surprising number of people were still wandering about on their pleasant , late-June evening . She wanted to be one of them , to start over with a clean slate . And why not ? Maria was poised to take over Tess 's charity patronages in Corsaria soon . Then there would be no need for Tess to remain . She could start a new life . The idea excited her so much that her heart began pounding . A new start . And what better time than now ? After all , Clara had just cleared her schedule for a week . For the first time in years , Tess 's time was her own , and she wanted to enjoy it in complete peace and quiet . Alone . Within minutes , she had decided what she was going to do . She was going to go to Sapphire Beach on the North Carolina coast , where she 'd spent her summers as a child . Without security , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy , Tess was going to take a holiday . ( Continues ... )
