After the noon meal Leah helped Sadie wash and dry each one of the kerosene lamp chimneys in the house . The glass tubes had been rather cloudy last evening during Bible reading and evening prayers , and Leah and Mamma had both noticed the light was too soft and misty because of it . Dat had n't complained at all , though he did have to adjust his reading glasses repeatedly , scooting close to the lamp in the kitchen , where they 'd all gathered just before twilight , the back door flung wide , along with all the windows , coaxing the slightest breeze into the warm house . We really ought a clean these every day , Leah said , handing one to Sadie for drying . No sense Dat struggling to see the Good Book , jah ? Sadie nodded halfheartedly . Are you going out again tonight ? Leah whispered . Sadie 's eyes gave a sharp warning . Ach , not now ... Glancing over her shoulder , Leah saw that Mamma was dusting the furniture in the sunroom . Cleanliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hannah and Mary Ruth had run outside to hose off the back porch and sidewalk . You 'll break Mamma 's heart if you 're sneaking out with English boys , ya know , she said softly . How do you know what I 'm doin ' ? I saw you come home last nightsaw what you were wearing , too . But before she could ask where on earth Sadie had gotten such a getup , Mamma returned , and that brought a quick end to their conversation . Leah washed the rest of the chimneys , turning her thoughts to the Preaching service tomorrow . Will Gid single me out again before the common meal ? she wondered . He had been more thanforthright with his intentions toward her before , though discreetly enough . Yet she knew he was counting the weeks till she was old enough to attend Sunday singings . And so was she , but for a far different reason . I 'll be first in line to ask you to ride home with me , he 'd said to her out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turn to have house church . Speechless at the time , she wished the Lord might give her something both wise and kind to say . To put him off gently . But not one word had come to mind and she just stood there , fidgeting while the smithy 's only son grinned down at her . What she was really looking forward to was next Sundaythe off-Sunday between church meetingswhen the People spent the day visiting relatives . Mamma was awful eager to go to Grasshopper Level and see the Mast cousins again . It had been several months . Leah remembered precisely where she was standing in the barn when Dat had given her the news of the visit . Looking down , in the haymow , she 'd stopped short , holding her pitchfork just so in front of her , half leaning on it while she willed her heart to slow its pace . She smiled , fondly recalling the first time she 'd ever talked with Jonas . The two of them had nearly missed out on supper , standing out in the milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on Aunt Lizzie 's side of the woods , near where the wild flowers grew . She had told him her favorite was the bluebird . Jonas had wholeheartedly agreed , his blue eyes searching hers . And for a moment , she nearly forgot he was three years older . He was Sadie 's age . Yet , unlike any other boy , he seemed to know and understand her heartwho Leah truly was . Not a tomboy , but a real girl . In all truth , she had n't experienced such a thing with anyone ever in her life . Not with Sadie , for sure . And not so much with Mamma , though on rare occasions her mother had opened up a bit . Hannah and Mary Ruth had each other and were constantly whispering private conversations . Only with Aunt Lizzie and Adah Peachey , Gid 's younger sister , could Leah share confidentially . So she and Jonas had a special something between them , which was too bad . At least Mamma would think so if she knew , because young women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless , of course , they were being courted or were married . Just now , Sadie glanced nervously toward the sunroom , where Mamma was still busy dusting . Walk me to the outhouse , Sadie whispered to Leah . What for ? Never mind , just come . Sadie led the way , through the utility room and enclosed porch , then down the back steps , past the twins , who laughed as they worked . Silently they walked , till Sadie said , turning quickly , Listen , if ya must know , I think I 'm falling in love . In love ? Ach , Sadie , who with ? Shh ! He lives down the road a ways . His name is Derry . So , I 'm right then , a fancy boy . Leah wanted to turn around right now and head back to the house . She did n't want to hear another filthy word . What 's happened to you ? English boys are big trouble . You ought a know from going to high school and all . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to talk sense to you ! Having a wild rumschpringe 's one thing , Sadie , but whatever ya do , do n't go outside the boundaries of the Ordnung . Sadie 's eyes were ablaze . Say whatcha want , but zip your lip . Maybe I should tell . Their eyes locked . Sadie leaned closer . You have a secret , too , Leah . Are you threatening me ? Call it what you will , but if Mamma finds out about me , I 'll know it came from you . And if you go and tell Mamma on me , I 'll tell Dat on you . And if Dat finds out you hope to marry Jonas ' stead of Smithy Gid , he 'll put a stop to it . Leah 's heart sank . Sadie had her , for sure . Glaring at her , Sadie opened the door to the outhouse and hurried inside . The second Leah heard the door latch shut , she turned and fled for home .
