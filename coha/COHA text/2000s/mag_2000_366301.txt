HIGH ON TECH ? Fidelity Magellan 's closely watched portfolio manager , Bob Stansky , seems to keep changing his mind about tech stocks . Last week newspapers reported that he upped his position in techs from 21% to 27% after just recently trimming it . But did he ? The shift may say more about the tech sector 's appreciation than it does about Stansky 's strategy . The lesson : look before you leap after the headlines . <P> PROTECTION PLAN Putnam Investments is offering insurance on its mutual funds against a stock slump and your untimely death . If you should expire when the market is down , your beneficiaries will still receive a decent payout . Let 's say that at 67 you have a $100,000 investment , and in a year it grows to $150,000 . For a 0.3% fee , you can each year lock in at the current account value so that if the stock drops , say to $120,000 the following year  --  and you drop  --  your heirs will still get $150,000 .

Supply constraints , increased demand and a chip shortage tied to last year 's earthquakes in Taiwan have kept prices up . But do n't run out to buy that PC to beat the next hike . With Y2K problems no longer a threat and production back on track , prices should head down in a few months . <P>  --  By Anamaria Wilson
