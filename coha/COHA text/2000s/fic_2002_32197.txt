Ealstan was still shaky on his feet . The young Forthwegian gauged how sick he 'd been by how long he was taking to get better . He also gauged how sick he 'd been by the medicine with which Vanai had helped him break his fever . When his wits came back , he scolded her : " You went out . You should n't have done that . You should n't have taken the chance . The Algarvians might have grabbed you and ... " He did n't want to go on . Vanai glared at him . Her gray-blue eyes flashed . People said Kaunians did n't get so excited as Forthwegians . Living with Vanai had proved to Ealstan that people did n't know what they were talking about . " What should I have done ? " she demanded . " Stayed here and watched you die and then tried to go out ? " " I was n't going to die . " But Ealstan 's comeback was n't so persuasive as he would have wanted , even to himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . When he looked at himself in the mirror , he saw how the flesh had melted from his swarthy , hook-nosed face . Circles almost as dark as his eyes lay under them . " Anyhow , it worked out all right , " Vanai said . " I went out , I found an apothecary , I got what you needed , and I came back . Nothing else happened . " " No ? " Ealstan said , and now she had trouble meeting his gaze . He pointed at her . " What was it ? How bad was it ? " " Nothing else happened , " she repeated , and slamming doors and falling bars were in her voice . A long time before , whenthey 'd first got to know each other , he 'd decided he would be wise not to ask her what she 'd gone through in Oyngestun . This was liable to be another time when trying to force truth from her would do more harm than good . " Let it go , then , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . He was so weary , a couple of days could go by without his having any interest in making love . Before he got sick , he would n't have believed such a thing possible . But , weary or not , he had to go out to buy food , for the cupboards in the flat were nearly empty . If he did n't go out , Vanai would have to . She 'd done it once . He did n't want her to have to do it twice , not when the redheaded occupiers of Forthweg had made her kind fair game . Moving like a man four times his age , he walked to the market square to buy beans and dried peas and barley and lentils . As long as he and Vanai had enough of those , they would n't starve . The trouble was , he could n't carry so much as he had before , either . That meant he had to make two trips to bring back the food he should have been able to take in one . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the knacker 's yard . Vanai fixed him a cup of mint tea . After he 'd drunk it , she half dragged him to the bedroom , peeled his shoes off him , and made him lie down . He hoped she would lie down beside him , or on top of him , or however she chose . Instead , she said , " Go to sleep . " He did . When he woke , he felt much more like himself . By then , Vanai did lie curled beside him . Her mouth had fallen open ; she was snoring a little . He looked over at her and smiled . She did n't just know what he wanted . She knew what he needed , too , and that was liable to be more important . A couple of days later , he started going out and about through Eoforwic , seeing the people for whom he cast accounts . He discovered he 'd lost a couple of them to other bookkeepers : inevitable , he supposed , when he had n't been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That he 'd kept as many clients as he had pleased him very much . Ethelhelm the singer and drummer was n't in his flat when Ealstan came to call . The doorman for the building said , " The gentleman has taken his band on tour , sir . He did give me an envelope to give you if you returned while he and his colleagues were away . " " Thanks , " Ealstan said , and then had to hand the fellow a coin for doing what he should have done for nothing . Ealstan took the envelope and went off before opening it ; whatever it held , he did n't want the doorman knowing it . Hello , the note read . I 'm hoping you 've come down with something . If you have n't , the Algarvians have probably come down on you and your lady . You can get over the one easier than the other , I think , the way things are these days . If you 're reading this , everything is probably all right . If you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . The band leader had scrawled his name below the last sentence . Ealstan smiled as he refolded the note and put it in his belt pouch . Ethelhelm enjoyed speaking in riddles and paradoxes . And Ealstan could hardly find fault with this one . Better to have any natural sickness than to let the Algarvians know he was harboring Vanai . That point got driven home when he came back to his own sorry little street . A couple of overage , overweight Algarvian constables were standing in front of the block of flats next to his . One of them turned to him and asked , " You knowing any Kaunian bitch living in this street here ? " " No , sir , " Ealstan answered . " I do n't think any of the stinking blonds are left in this part of town . " He did his best to sound like an ordinary Forthwegian , a Forthwegian who hated Kaunians as much as King Mezentio 's men did . The other Algarvian spoke in his own language : " Oh , leave it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to have her . The world wo n't end . She paid us off . " " Bah , " the first constable said . " Even if all these buggers say they never saw her , we both know she 's around here somewhere . " After King Mezentio 's men took Gromheort , Ealstan 's home town in eastern Forthweg , they 'd made academy students start learning Algarvian instead of classical Kaunian . That no doubt helped make the students better subjects . It also sometimes had other uses . Ealstan made a point of looking as dull and uninterested as he could . " Digging her out is more trouble than it 's worth , " the second constable insisted . " And if we try digging her out and do n't come up with her , we 'll be walking the beat around the city dump till the end of time . Come on , let 's go . " Though he kept grumbling , the constable who 'd spoken Forthwegian let himself be persuaded . Off he went with his pal . Ealstan stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanai , he would have been amazed . But they were n't going to call in their pals and try to unearth her . Ealstan clung to that . As he walked upstairs , he wondered if he ought to mention what he 'd overheard . He decided that was a bad idea . When Vanai let him in after his coded knock , she clicked her tongue between her teeth in dismay . " Sit down , " she said in tones that brooked no argument . " You 're worn to a nub . Let me get you some wine . You should n't have gone out . " " I have to keep my business going , or else we wo n't be able to buy food , " he said , but he was glad to sit down on the shabby sofa and stretch his feet out in front of him . Vanai fetched him the wine , clucking all the while , and sat down beside him . He cocked his head to one side . " You do n't need to make such a fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eyebrow . " If I do n't , who will ? " Ealstan opened his mouth , then closed it again . He had no good answer , and was smart enough to realize as much . If they did n't take care of each other here in Eoforwic , no one else would . Things were n't as they had been back in Gromheort for him , with his mother and father and sister to worry about him and his big brother to flatten any nuisances he could n't handle himself . And having Vanai fuss over him was n't like having his mother fuss . He had trouble defining how and why it was n't , but the difference remained . After another sip of wine , he decided that Vanai , even though she fussed , did n't treat him as if he were two years old while she was doing it . As far as his mother was concerned , he would never be anything but a child . He took one more sip of wine , then nodded to Vanai . " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's what I needed . " " You 're welcome , " she said , and laughed , though not as if she were merry and carefree . " I sound silly , do n't I ? But I hardly know what to do when somebody tells me that . My grandfather did n't , or not very often , and the things I had to do for him .... " She laughed again , even more grimly than before . " Maybe Brivibas had trouble figuring out you were n't a baby any more , " Ealstan said ; if that was true for his parentsespecially his motherwhy not for Vanai 's grandfather , too ? But she shook her head . " No . He had an easier time with me when I was small . He could count on me to do as I was told then . Later on ... " Now her eyes twinkled . " Later on , he never could be sure I would n't do something outrageous and disgracefulsay , falling in love with a Forthwegian . " " Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad you picked that , " Ealstan said . " So am I , " Vanai answered . " A lot of my other choices were worse . " She looked bleak again , but , with what seemed a distinct effort of will , put aside the expression . Her voice thoughtful , she went on , " You know , I did n't fall in love with you , not really , till we 'd been in this flat for a while . " " No ? " Ealstan said in no small surprise . He 'd fallen head over heels in love with her from the moment she 'd given him her body . That was how he thought of it , anyway . She shook her head again . " No . I always liked you , from the first time we met hunting mushrooms . I would n't have done what I did there in the woods last fall if I had n't . But you were ... a way out for me , when I did n't think I could have one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much more you were . " For a moment , his feelings were hurt . Then he realized she 'd paid him no small compliment . " I wo n't let you down , " he said . Vanai leaned over and gave him a quick kiss . " I know you wo n't , " she answered . " Do n't you see ? That 's one of the reasons I love you . No one else has ever been like that for me . I suppose my mother and father would have been , but I can hardly even remember them . " Ealstan had always known he could count on his family . He 'd taken that as much for granted as the shape of his hand . He said , " I 'm sorry . That must have been hard . It must have been even harder because you 're a Kaunian in a mostly Forthwegian kingdom . " " You might say so . Aye , you just might say so . " Vanai 's voice went harsh and ragged . " And do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ealstan shook his head . He was n't sure she noticed ; she was staring at nothing in particular as she went on , " The worst part of it is , we did n't know when we were well off . In Forthweg , we Kaunians were well off . Would you have believed that ? I would n't have believed it , but it was true . All we needed was the Algarvians to prove it , and they did . " Ealstan put his arm around her . He thought of those two chubby constables in kilts and hoped the powers above would keep them away . Even if he had n't been feeling so feeble , he feared that encircling arm would n't be so much protection as Vanai was liable to need . But it was what he could give . It was what she had . She seemed to sense as much , for she moved closer to him . " We 'll get through it , " he said . " Somehow or other , we 'll get through it . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stay hidden forever , and there 's nowhere I can go , either , not if they win . " But the Algarvians could win , as Ealstan knew all too well . " Maybe not in Forthweg , " he admitted , " but Forthweg is n't the only kingdom in the world , either . " Vanai looked at him as if he 'd taken leave of his senses . Maybe I have , he thought . But then again , maybe I have n't . Hajjaj stared down at the papers his secretary handed him . " Well , well , " he said . " This is a pretty pickle , is n't it ? " " Aye , your Excellency , " Qutuz answered . " How do you propose to handle it ? " " Carefully , " the Zuwayzi foreign minister said , which won a smile from Qutuz . Hajjaj went on , " And by that I mean , not least , not letting the Algarvians know I 'm doing anything at all . They 're our allies , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep this business secret ? " Qutuz asked . " A while , " Hajjaj replied . " Not indefinitely . And , before it is secret no more , I had better get King Shazli 's views on the matter . " I had better see if I can bring King Shazli 's views around to my own , if they happen to differ now . " I do n't think that will wait . Please let his Majesty 's servitors know that I seek audience with him at his earliest convenience . " His secretary bowed . " I shall attend to it directly , your Excellency , " he said , and hurried away . Hajjaj nodded at his bare brown departing backside : like all Zuwayzin , Qutuz wore clothes only when dealing with important foreigners . Hajjaj 's secretary was diligent , no doubt about it . When he said directly , he meant it . And , only a couple of hours later that afternoon , Hajjaj bowed low before the king . " I gather this is a matter of some urgency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or so Hajjaj thought of himthe late sixties looking back at the early thirties . " Shall we dispense with the rituals of hospitality , then ? " " If your Majesty would be so kind , " Hajjaj replied , and the king inclined his head . Thus encouraged , Hajjaj continued , " You need to declare your policy on a matter of both some delicacy and some importance to the kingdom . " " Say on , " Shazli told him . " I shall . " Hajjaj brandished the papers Qutuz had given him . " In the past couple of weeks , we have had no fewer than three small boats reach our eastern coastline from Forthweg . All three were packed almost to the sinking point with Kaunians , and all the Kaunians alive when they came ashore have begged asylum of us . " Sometimes , to flavor a dish , Zuwayzi chefs would fill a little cheesecloth bag with spices and put it in the pot . They were supposed to take it out when the meal was cooked , but every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who had just bitten down on one of those bags thinking it a lump of meat . " They beg asylum from us because of what our allies are doing to their folk back in Forthweg . " " Even so , your Majesty , " Hajjaj agreed . " If we send them back , we send them to certain death . If we grant them asylum , we offend the Algarvians as soon as they learn of it , and we run the risk that everything in Forthweg that floats will put to sea and head straight for Zuwayza . " " What Algarve is doing to the Kaunians in Forthweg offends me , " Shazli said ; he needed only the royal we to sound as imperious as King Swemmel of Unkerlant . Hajjaj had never felt prouder of him . The king went on , " And any Kaunians who escape will be a cut above the common crowdis it not so ? " " It 's likely , at any rate , your Majesty , " the foreign minister answered . " Asylum they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed as deeply as his age-stiffened body would let him . " I am honored to serve you . But what shall we say to Marquis Balastro when he learns of it , as he surely will before long ? " King Shazli smiled a warm , confident smile . Hajjaj knew what that sort of smile had to mean even before the king said , " That I leave to you , your Excellency . I am sure you will find a way to let us do what is right while at the same time not enraging our ally 's minister . " " I wish I were so sure , your Majesty , " Hajjaj said . " I do remind you , I am only a man , not one of the powers above . I can do one of those things or the other . I have no idea how to do both at once . " " You 've been managing the impossible now for as long as Zuwayza has had her freedom back from Unkerlant , " Shazli said . " Do you wonder when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Your Majesty , may I have your leave to go ? " Hajjaj asked . That was as close as he 'd ever come to being rude to his sovereign . He softened it at once by adding , " If I am to do thisif I am to try to do thisI shall need to lay a groundwork for it , if I possibly can . " " You may go , of course , " Shazli said , " and good fortune attend your groundlaying . " But he 'd heard the edge in his foreign minister 's voice . By his sour expression , he did n't care for it . Bowing his way out , Hajjaj did n't care for being put in a position where he had to snap at the king . When the foreign minister got back to his office , Qutuz raised an inquiring eyebrow . " They will stay , " Hajjaj said . " All I have to do now is devise a convincing explanation for Marquis Balastro as to why they may stay . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone can do it , though , you are the man . " Again , Hajjaj was bemused that others had so much more faith in him than he had in himself . Since Shazli had given him the task , though , he had to try to do it . " Bring me a city directory for Bishah , if you would be so kind , " he said . Qutuz 's eyebrows climbed again . " A city directory ? " he echoed . Hajjaj nodded and offered not a word of explanation . His secretary mumbled something under his breath . Now Hajjaj 's eyebrow rose , in challenge . Qutuz had no choice but to go fetch a directory . But he was still mumbling as he went . Even though Hajjaj donned his spectacles , reading the small print in the directory was a trial . Fortunately , he had a good notion of the kinds of names he was looking for . Whenever he came across one , he underlined it in red ink and dog-eared the page so he could find it again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names : they belonged to men he 'd known for years . When he was done , he put the directory in his desk and hoped he would n't have to pull it out again . That that was a forlorn hope , he knew perfectly well . And , sure enough , less than a week later Qutuz came in and told him , " Marquis Balastro is waiting in the outer office . He came without seeking an appointment first , and he says he could n't care less whether you bother putting on clothes or not . " Balastro no doubt meant it ; he came closer to conforming to Zuwayzi usages than any other minister . Nevertheless , Hajjaj said , " Tell him that , for the sake of my kingdom 's dignity , I prefer to dress before receiving him . Getting into those ridiculous wrappings will also give me time to think , but you need not tell him that . Be sure to bring in tea and wine and cakes as quick as you can . " " Just as you say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , the Algarvian . " Balastro usually had the hail-fellow-well-met air so many of his countrymen could don with ease . Not today . Today he was furious , and making no effort to hide it . Or , perhaps , today he donned a mask of fury with as much skill as he usually used while wearing a mask of affability . Before Balastro could do much in the way in the way of blustering , Hajjaj 's secretary came in with the customary dainties on a silver tray . The Algarvian minister fumed to see them , but his manners were too good to let him talk business for a while . Hajjaj carefully hid his smile ; he enjoyed turning the Algarvian 's respect for Zuwayzi customs against him . But the small talk over refreshments could go on only so long . At last , Hajjaj had to ask , " And to what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected visit ? " " Unexpected ? I doubt it , " Balastro said , but some of the harsh edge was gone from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent wine . Still , he did not sound accommodating as he went on , " Unless you can speak the truth when you tell me your kingdom is n't taking in Kaunian fugitives . " " No , I can not do that , and I do not intend to try , " Hajjaj replied . " Zuwayza is indeed taking in Kaunian refugees , and will continue to do so . " " King Mezentio has charged me to say to you that your giving haven to these fugitives " Marquis Balastro clung to his own word " can not be construed as anything but an unfriendly act on the part of your kingdom . " He glared at Hajjaj ; the wine had n't softened him so much after all . " Algarve knows full well how to punish unfriendly acts . " " I am sure of it . " Hajjaj glared back . " Is Mezentio thinking of using us as fodder for his mages to kill to power their sorceries , along with however many Kaunians you have left ? " The sheer insolence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balastro lean forward in surprise . " By no means , your Excellency , " he replied after a pause for thought . " But you are an ally , or so Algarve has believed . Do you wonder that we mislike it when you clasp our enemies to your bosom ? " " Zuwayza is a small kingdom of free men , " Hajjaj replied . " Do you wonder that we welcome others who come to us looking for freedom they can not find in their own lands ? " " I wonder that you welcome Kaunians , " Balastro growled . " And you know cursed well why I wonder that you welcome them , too . " " Indeed I do . " Hajjaj pulled the city directory out of the drawer where he had put it a few days before and opened it to one of the dog-eared pages . " I see here the name of Uderzo the florist , who has been here for thirty years nowsince he got out of Algarve at the end of the Six Years ' War . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long , and got here the same way . Do you think Forthweg and Jelgava and Valmiera and Lagoas were n't screaming at us for taking in Algarvian refugees ? If you do , sir , you 're daft . " He opened the directory to yet another marked page . " I can show you a great many more , if you like . " " Never mind . I take your point . " But Balastro did n't look or sound happy about taking it . " I remind you , though , your Excellency , that you were not allied to any of those kingdoms at the time . " " As I have told you before , we are your allies , we are your cobelligerents against Unkerlant , but we are not your servants or your slaves , " Hajjaj replied . " If you try to treat us as if we were , we shall have to see how long we can remain your allies . " " If you bring in spies and enemies , we shall have to see whether we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many dragons you have from us , and how many behemoths ; remember how our dragonfliers help ward your skies . If you want to face Unkerlant on your own ... " He shrugged . Would Mezentio make good on such a threat ? He might , and Hajjaj knew it ; the Zuwayzi foreign minister dared not underestimate the hatred the King of Algarve had for Kaunians . " How long ago were you begging us for more help here in the north ? " Hajjaj asked . " Not very , as I recall . " " We did n't get much of it , as I recall . " Balastro leaned forward again , this time with keen interest . " Might we get more , in exchange for looking the other way at certain things you do ? " Algarvians were good at looking the other way when there were things they did n't want to see . Hajjaj usually found that trait dismaying . Now he might be able to use it to Zuwayza 's advantage . " That could be a bargain , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape this dilemma with honor after all . Skarnu 's world had shrunk to the farm where he lived with Merkela and Raunu , the hamlet of Pavilosta , and the roads between those places . He 'd had little reason and less chance to go far astray since washing up on the farm , one more piece of flotsam tossed adrift as Valmiera foundered . By now , though , he 'd made a name for himself as one of the leaders of the fight against Algarve in his country . He was n't sure how he felt about that . On the one hand , he was flattered that other Valmierans knew he was one of those who had n't despaired of the kingdom . On the other , their knowing he remained a rebel against the occupiers made it more likely the redheads would find out , too . And so , when he strode into the town of Tytuvenai , he looked around to make sure no Algarvians were paying him any undue attention . To his surprise , he saw hardly any of King Mezentio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Skarnu patrolled them instead . In smart uniforms that reminded him of the one he 'd worn in the army , they eyed his homespun tunic and baggy trousers with almost as much scorn as nobles in Priekule would have aimed at him . " Come to see the bright lights , farmboy ? " one of them called to Skarnu . The fellow 's partner laughed . " Aye , " Skarnu answered with a wide , foolish grin . The role he played amused him : a city man pretending to be a country yokel to fool a couple of other city men . But if the new audience criticized his performance , he would n't get a bad notice in the local news sheet . He 'd get killed . He 'd never been in Tytuvenai before , and so some of his curiosity was genuine . The town , he 'd heard , had some monuments that dated back to the days of the Kaunian Empire . He saw none . He did see some plots of ground that looked as if they 'd recently held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Algarvian wreckers had got rid of monuments they did n't fancy , as he knew they 'd done elsewhere in Valmiera . After some searching , he found the tavern called the Drunken Dragon . The dragon on the signboard above the door certainly looked as if it had had several too many . Skarnu smiled up at it . Before he went inside , he checked to make sure no one had picked his pockets : the Drunken Dragon lay in that kind of neighborhood . Valmieran constables did n't come hereabouts . Inside , the place was dark and smoky and crowded . People gave Skarnu , a stranger , a once-over as he made his way to the bar . " What 'll it be ? " asked the taverner , a man missing a couple of fingers from his right handprobably from a wound in the Six Years ' War , for he was old enough . " Ale and roasted chestnuts , " Skarnu answered , as he 'd been told to do . The taverner eyed him , then slowly nodded . After giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why do n't you take ' em over to that table by the fireplace ? Looks like it 's got room for a couple more . " " All right , I 'll do that , " Skarnu said . The men sitting at that table did n't look much different from the rest of the crowd . Some were old . Some were young . None looked rich . One or two looked a good deal shabbier than Skarnu did . A couple , but only a couple , looked as if they 'd be nasty customers in a fight . " Where you from ? " one of the tough-looking fellows asked . That was the question he 'd been waiting for . " Pavilosta , " he answered . " Ah , " the tough said . Several of the men nodded . One of them lifted a glass of wine in salute . " Simanu . That was a nice piece of work . " Skarnu had never heard an assassination praised in such matter-of-fact terms . This was the crowd he 'd come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonds at the table was an Algarvian spy . By coming to Tytuvenai , he 'd bet his life none of them was . A balding fellow with silver-rimmed spectacles said , " We 're just about all here now . I do n't know if Zarasai will be able to come . " That was not the name of a man but the name of a town : a sensible precaution , Skarnu judged . The bespectacled man went on , " Those people talk all the way across Valmiera . They can act all over the kingdom at the same time , too . We have to be able to do the same if we 're going to make their lives interesting . " " It sounds good , " the ruffian said , " but how do we go about it ? The post is slow , and the whoresons read it . Where are we going to get enough crystals ? And how do we keep their mages from listening in on them ? Emanations will leak , and we ca n't afford it , not if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those are good questions , " the man with the silver spectacles said , nodding . " But we ca n't go on as we have been , either . A good blow like the one at Count Simanu went half wasted because we did n't make those people sweat all over the place at the same time . And we could have . But we did n't , because we did n't know it would happen till after it did . " Nobody talked about Algarvians or redheads , or named King Mezentio . That , Skarnu judged , was also wise : no telling who might be trying to listen at some of the nearby tables . Skarnu said , " Only trouble is , if you 'd known ahead of time , they might have known ahead of time , too . " " Aye . " That was the tough again , his voice gone savage . " We 've spawned enough traitors and to spare , that 's certain . And it 's not just the nobles who go riding with ... those people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , either . " Skarnu thought of his sister , the Marchioness Krastaan Algarvian colonel 's lover these daysbut not for long , for the fellow was continuing , " There 's traitors all the way down . When our time comes round again , we 'll have some fancy killing to do . " He sounded as if he looked forward to every bit of it . " We must be ruthless , but we must be fair , " the bespectaded man said . " This is n't Unkerlant , after all . " The tough tossed his head . " No , it sure is n't , is it ? Unkerlant is still in the fight . Do n't you wish we could say the same ? " Skarnu winced . That hit home , painfully hard . He said , " We 're still in the fight . " " A whole table 's worth of us , " the tough said . " Speaks well for the kingdom , that it does . But you 're right , Pavilosta . We 're what Valmiera 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set her to rights when the day is ours . " One of the other irregulars was about to say something when the tavern door opened . The fellow with the silver-rimmed spectacles nodded to himself . " Maybe that will be Zarasai after all . " But it was n't yet another Valmieran who had n't given up on the fight against Algarve . Instead , it was a kilted Algarvian officer , backed by a handful of his own countrymen and quite a few more Valmieran constables . He spoke in a loud voice : " I am hearing there is an unlawful assembling here . You are all under arresting for questioning . " Somebody threw a mug at himnot somebody from the table at which Skarnu sat . It caught the redhead in the face . He went down with a yowl , clutching at his smashed face . A moment later , all the mugs in the Drunken Dragon seemed to be flying . Skarnu was n't sure the Valmieran army had tossed so many eggs at the redheads while it was still a going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these Algarvians and their Valmieran stooges surged into the tavern . Some of them had bludgeons , and started beating on anyone they could reach . Some of them had sticks . To Skarnu 's shame , the redheads trusted the Valmieran constables with such weapons , sure they would use them against their own countrymen . Except for the fire , all the lights in the tavern went out . That just made the brawl more confusing . Skarnu sprang off his chair and laid about him . The chair slammed into somebody 's ribs . Whoever it was went down with a groan . Skarnu hoped he 'd flattened a foe , not a friend . " Back here ! " That was the bespectacled man 's voice . It came from the direction of the bar . Skarnu fought his way toward it . Someone close by him took a beam in the chest and toppled . When Skarnu smelled burnt flesh , he went down , too , and crawled the rest of the way . The Valmieran army had failed against Algarve , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , he almost crawled over the tough . The fellow grinned at him and said , " Come on , pal . I know the back way . " " Good , " Skarnu said . " I hoped there was one . " He also hoped the Algarvians and the constables who did their bidding were n't watching it and scooping up fleeing foes one by one . The tough scrambled into the little room in back of the bar . Skarnu followed him . The little room had a door that opened on the alleyway behind the Drunken Dragon . The tough hurried through it . Skarnu would have peered out first . But when the tough did n't get blazed , he followed again . Nobody looked to be watching the alley . Maybe the Algarvians did n't know it was there , and maybe the Valmieran constables had n't bothered telling them about it . Skarnu hoped the constables were n't cooperating so enthusiastically as they seemed to be , anyhow . After looking this way and that , he said , " Now we split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you the same thing , Pavilosta , " the other Valmieran answered . " You 've got a pretty good notion of what you 're doing , looks like . Powers above keep you safe . " " And you , " Skarnu said . The tough had n't waited for his reply , but was already strolling down the alley as if he did n't have a care in the world . Skarnu strolled up it , trying to act similarly nonchalant . He felt easier when he ducked into another alleyway that ran into the one behind the tavern . That second alley led him to a third , and the third to a fourth . Tytuvenai seemed to have a web of little lanes going nowhere in particular . By the time Skarnu emerged onto a real street , he was several blocks away from the Drunken Dragon . He hoped more of the men who kept on resisting the Algarvians had got out after the tough and him . " You , there ! " The call was sharp and peremptory . Skarnu turned . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bumpkin . What are you doing here ? " If he was trying to panic Skarnu , he failed . For all the world as if he were nothing but a bumpkin , the marquis jingled coins in his pocket . " Sold some eggs , " he answered . " Now I 'm heading home . " ( Continues ... )
