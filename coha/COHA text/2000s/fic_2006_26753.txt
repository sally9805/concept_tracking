The body was bloated , glistening with lake water , and had a grotesque , waxy appearance , blotched gray and white . I 'd never seen anything like it and hoped I never would again . It lay naked on the landward edge of the dock and stank to high heaven  --  an awful combination of the sick smell of dead flesh and the sodden perfume of fish , algae , and lake water . I had parked about fifty yards away and was glad I 'd had the foresight to buy a pack of menthols before making the drive up 104 . I opened the cellophane wrapper with trembling hands  --  praying this monstrosity was n't Jen  --  took out one of the cigarettes , broke it apart , then wedged the pieces , with the factory-cut ends first , into my nostrils . There were six State Police divers in black wetsuits , having a mug-up ( Maine-speak for a coffee break ) by the boat ramp , off-wind from the corpse . Why six divers , I wondered . And , God me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up or not , though I assumed she had n't or she would have turned to greet me . Five crime scene analysts were hard at work , including a photographer I knew by her first name , Gretchen . She was a pretty , statuesque black woman about Jamie 's height(Jamie 's 5 ' 11 " ) , who once had a crush on me . Four uniformed troopers and two detectives were also on hand . They were standing around not doing much except trying to ignore the smell . A trooper came over to stop me but a detective said , " That 's okay , Congressman Schiff . He 's official . " I wondered at the trooper 's odd title , then recognized the other man . " Hey , Sinclair . How 's it going ? " Jamie turned and looked up at me , shielding her eyes . " Well , other than the smell , " said Sinclair , " I guess I 'm okay . How about you ? " Jamie interrupted our reunion with a loud , happy laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack ? " I shrugged , feeling silly . " It 's an old cop trick . " She stood up , casually dusted off one knee , and laughed some more . She was wearing chinos and a maroon turtleneck sweater under a barn jacket the color of brown mustard . Her dark chestnut hair , which she usually wore long , had been cut recently to shoulder length . She said it would look better with her wedding dress . I did n't see the need and was still having trouble getting used to the change . " Can you breathe like that ? " she asked , smiling . " A little , though I can still smell the body . " She sighed , and tilted her head toward the corpse . " Yeah , it 's pretty bad . It could be a lot worse , though . " I wondered how . And hoped it was n't Jen . I said , " Any idea yet on how long she 's been in the water ? " She shook her head . " Not pinpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I breathed a sigh of relief . Good , it was n't Jen . " Could be even longer , " she said . " Some of the fatty tissue has converted to adipocere , and it takes at least five months for that to happen . It also keeps the smell down . " I nodded as if I knew what she was talking about . Or as if I agreed about the smell . " Any ID ? " " Nope . She 's a Jane Doe for now . " " Tough break , " I said , then looked at the uniformed cop  --  who was staring at me . " So , you 're a congressman and a cop ? " He gave me a sour look and started to say something but Sinclair interrupted him with a snort . " Nah , his parents played a mean trick on him . Congressman 's his first name . " He stuck out his hand . " Glad to meet you , Detective Field . I 've heard a lot about you . And call me Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not really a detective anymore , no matter what my fiancee thinks . So , you never thought of going down to the courthouse to have it changed ? " He gave a resigned shrug . " Would n't make much difference now . People 'd still razz me about what it used to be . " " Yeah , " I said , backing upwind of the body , toward the far end of the dock , " but you could at least upgrade yourself . You could be Senator Schiff . Or Governor . " " Good idea , Jack , " said Sinclair , elbowing Schiff . " I think I 'll start calling myself Pope Sinclair . " " See what I mean ? " muttered Schiff . Jamie said , " Jack , now what are you doing ? " " The breeze . . . " I said , walking a few more steps away . " I want to get upwind of the body . " I looked out at the water , which was lit by the late afternoon sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ densely wooded area across the lake , thinking at first it was an autumn leaf fluttering in the breeze , but then it moved deliberately , like someone adjusting a car mirror , and I knew it was sunlight reflecting off glass . Jamie sighed . " You really are a wimp about this . " " What ? " I turned . " You mean the smell ? It is n't that . Well , it is n't just that . The thing is , I do n't want it getting into my clothes , not to mention my hair and beard . It 's going to drive the dogs nuts if they pick it up on me when I get back to the kennel . Have n't you ever worked on a floater before ? " She gave me a pointed look , then gave the slightest tilt of her head toward the rest of the law enforcement personnel . I guess she did n't want them thinking she was a novice . " Sorry , " I said . " Any idea yet on the cause of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some marks on her chest . They could be knife wounds , they could be postmortem bites from the fish in the lake . " The breeze kicked up and she crinkled her nose . " Got any more cigarettes ? And is your stress level about the wedding so bad that you 've taken up smoking ? " Continues ...
