So , were you doing any buying ? If you were , you were pretty much alone as the stock market crumbled on Friday , breaking records on the down side with the same vigor it had displayed for so long while smashing standards going the other way . The question is n't just rhetorical . If you were n't buying this dip , what makes you think anyone else should be willing to step up to the plate ? <P> For most of the past 10 years , stepping up has n't been an issue . The masses in mutual funds have tripped over one another to buy stocks on every decline  --  including some doozies such as the aftermath of the Asia crisis two years ago . Hypnotized by a near perfect economy with plenty of jobs , soaring corporate profits and low inflation , investors always saw falling prices as a second chance to get stocks that had run away from them . The declines never lasted . <P> Maybe this one wo n't last either . Maybe the buyers will ride in on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's simply too early to tell . What we know for sure , though , is that they did n't ride in last week , when the only tracks in evidence were left by the bears who trampled the NASDAQ , which fell a record 25.3% for the week , and the Dow , which on Friday suffered its worst one-day point loss  --  a , ahem , dip of 618 points . <P> We also know that those who tried to save the day two weeks ago on Terrible Tuesday  --  the day the NASDAQ fell 13.6% but got almost all of it back in a matter of hours  --  are now worse off for their efforts . The index finished on Friday at 3321 , well below the week-earlier bottom of 3649 . Investors who had smugly picked up Cisco at $64 and watched it rebound to $76 were by late last week the proud owners of a $57 stock . That will probably work out for them longer term . But raise your hand if you think such chastened buyers are going to bottom feed hungrily again real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reserves buying during the earlier rout . <P> That 's how bear markets go . Instead of every dip being a buying opportunity , every rally becomes a chance to unload . " For the first time in a while , people have got really scared , " notes longtime bear Barton Biggs , chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . He was expecting more selling this week , fueled by margin calls , margin-related liquidations and fidgety institutions . Mutual-fund investors , generally , have been holding on , Biggs says , though they have n't been aggressive buyers , and some fund companies got hit with redemptions . What should you do ? For advice on riding out volatile markets , see my column on page 92 . <P> Is this a bear market ? It may be , and it may be all but over already . With information so quickly and extensively disseminated via the Internet , and with the low cost of trading , rapid market moves have become common . The time it takes to correct market excesses has condensed . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon stock prices are on firm footing again . In fact , Wall Street has n't witnessed a drawn-out bloodletting since 1983-84.
