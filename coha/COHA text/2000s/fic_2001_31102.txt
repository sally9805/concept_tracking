Chapter Three My family lived in Buffalo , sooty and robust in the days of my serene childhood in the late forties and early fifties . My father was a successful insurance man and my mother was rarely happy , except while tending to her garden , which surrounded our comfortable little house on Cleveland Avenue . My father held strong , favorable opinions about the Democratic Party , and his plump face would redden when I questioned his judgments about such men as Averell Harriman and Herbert Lehman , as well as figures like Joseph Crangle , who helped to run Buffalo ; and sometimes our arguments at dinner became so fevered that he would leave the table . Still , I respected my father as the sort of white-collar personage who forms the spine of America . ( He lived , as Max Weber once said , in the belief that " a man does not ' by nature ' wish to earn more and more money , but simply to live as he is accustomed to live . " ) My parents were people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , if one listens carefully . I can not say that I agreed with most of what I heard from my father ; nor , in any case , do I remember very much . But growing up as his son undoubtedly helped me to become the person I am . I graduated from Darleigh in the spring of 1961 ( my senior year clouded in a haze of sensuality ; often , Carol Ann Margolies and I sat side by side , and found ourselves caught in nature 's urgent grip , shedding garments even as final sentences were composed ) , and as soon as I got my diploma , a magna , my father asked what I intended to do with myself . We 'd held similar conversations over the years , and I had always tried , while being tactful , to make clear that I had no intention of following his example . When I mentioned a career in journalism , I saw despair distort his features , so I quickly went on to explain . " I do n't intend to be the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I intend to write about the fabric of our time . " My father shook his head . " Someday you 'll want to marry , to have a family , " he said . " I know one newspaperman , Fred something-or-other , who bought a whole-life policy from me . I believe that Fred earns ninety dollars a week . " I suppressed a chuckle . " I believe that Mr. Walter Lippmann earns many times that amount , " I replied , and went on to mention several others who did , too . My father had no good answer at the ready , and said , " You 've got big ideas , Brandon . " My father , as I 've tried to suggest , had a good heart , but he was not quite able to comprehend what mattered to someone like me and frequently repeated his small-minded belief that I had " big ideas . " That was certainly true , but I also understood , as Napoleon said , that ability is of little account without opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening at a Buffalo newspaper from a high school acquaintance ( someone who had not gone to college , and worked in the sports department ) . It was not a prestigious venue , but I believed that I would have a chance to learn the " ropes , " in a way that might not have been possible elsewhere . The Buffalo Vindicator was on Main Street . Carved above the doorway in Gothic type was the newspaper 's name and in the lobby was a mural forty feet long and fifteen feet high . It contained , among its many elements , a rendering of Thomas Jefferson reading a newspaper , alongside Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln , doing likewise . In the background was the great dome of City Hall , and Lake Erie , and if one looked closely , it was possible to see countless skillfully painted windows and through them more people reading more newspapers . It was a sight listed in guidebooks of the time , and the image has undoubtedly influenced my thinking about the profession . My city editor , Julius Portino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had sleepy brown eyes and soft , drooping bags beneath them ; and he told me that starting reporters got paid seventy-two dollars a week and were expected to write about fires and crime . Portino clearly was content to spend a lifetime with the Vindicator , and to respond to news without trying to understand its deeper import . I was struck by his utter lack of curiosity . I had been on the job for two or three months when it occurred to me that an inordinate number of fires were breaking out and that a larger story might be lurking behind the many smaller ones . Portino , however , merely shrugged when I went into his office and told him this with the fervor of a young reporter . " There are a lot of frame houses in Buffalo , Brandon , " he said , and lighted another of his many cigarettes . " Some of them burn . " Julius Portino had been drafted after high school and had gone to Korea , an experience that certainly shaped his view that the unexamined life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doubt , from two different worlds , and I believe that if we had not disagreed about the fires that kept breaking out around the Queen City , something else would have led to a clash . What precipitated the break between us was my decision to speak directly to his superior . Even now , I can visualize Wriston ( Chet ) Budge , who had been the newspaper 's editor in chief since 1935 : with his shredding unlit cigar , the ashes that made their powdery way down his unbuttoned vest , and his reddened , gray cheeks , it was as if he had shaped himself into his idea of a small-town newspaperman . Mr. Budge had won a Pulitzer Prize for deadline reporting in 1928 , when he was , like myself , a recent Darleigh graduate . I think that this shared background helped us to forge a bond , although Mr. Budge by the time we met was in his middle fifties . I had also heard that he was disappointed at his lot in life , and he often complained that writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I proposed to Mr. Budge that I pen a series of commentaries on the outbreak of possible arson . There would be no reckless claims ( I stressed the word " possible " ) , but we would ask for increased vigilance from the fire department , the police , and the mayor 's office . As I went on , Mr. Budge seemed barely to pay attention , yet he also seemed overjoyed at the prospect that I would be willing to jot down my thoughts ; and before I 'd finished laying out my thesis , he clapped his hands with enthusiasm . Moments later , he summoned the city editor to join us . I was horrified at Julius 's display of uncontrolled anger , particularly when he turned to me , in front of Mr. Budge , and said , " You went over my head , you fuckface sneak . " I could not meet his eyes , nor could I watch the spittle at the corner of his mouth , and my gaze drifted over to Mr. Budge 's Pulitzer citation , which hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , " Portino said to Mr. Budge , his teeth quivering , " that he ought to do a few months of reporting before jumping to ridiculous conclusions . " I noticed that his face had become darker . " But our young friend appears to prefer going behind my back . " I understood how he could have reached that conclusion , but I was nevertheless stunned . My ambition , after all , was modest : to examine a puzzling situation , and to put authorities on notice  --  trying , in short , to do my job . I did not know what Julius Portino 's private agenda was , or even if he had one ( as far as I knew , his Italian family , although it imported olive oil , was upright ) , but his words made me suspect his motives . " That 's a curious statement , " I said , looking directly at Mr. Budge , who looked at his watch . " Look , " Mr. Budge said , " I have n't the time for this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you calm down ? " Portino seemed unable to speak . Nor did he say much more to me during the time that I remained at the Vindicator , although now and then I thought I heard him mumble curses , and it was clear that he would always regard me with irrational anger . There was another reason that I chose to begin my career in Buffalo : the chance to lodge in my childhood home , which allowed me to become better acquainted with my parents while setting aside money that would otherwise have gone for rent . But after six months , it came to a stop ; my mother wept , and it 's probably true that , in my zeal , I might have taken too little heed of others . ( In some ways , my own son has mirrored my conduct of that time ; I 've not been able to avoid thinking that a certain portion of just deserts has been served up . ) In my case , there were the usual small things that widen a family 's gulf : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not always convenient to let my father know in advance . The telephone sometimes rang at hours that neither my father nor mother , who kept to a regular schedule , could become accustomed to . I most regret making use of my father 's confidential insurance records , which contained invaluable data that supported my thesis on the arson epidemic . To this day , I believe that we had an implicit understanding , but I can also see that I might have misread him and might have misjudged the reaction of his former clients . Those who have wished me ill have ferreted out this episode and made much of it , as if it revealed something fundamentally bad about my character . Those who know the facts will see that it was a terrible misunderstanding , although for my father , who was dismissed from his job for cause , the consequences were severe . I did not make many new friends during this time in Buffalo . I had nothing in common with my former classmate  --  the one who worked in the sports department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while mine was baseball : an expanse of greensward excited my senses , for it promised not only a game , but a representation of life . At night , I often thought about Carol Ann Margolies , with whom I 'd promised to stay in touch . I remember sending her a Hanukkah card , and thinking how grateful I was to have learned about her ancient faith . But life , I have found , is a series of partings , and regrets ; and when one is young , one quickly meets new people who seem to replace the old ones .
