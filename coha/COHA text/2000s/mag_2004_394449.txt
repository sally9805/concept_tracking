1946 to 1974 <p> In his kaleidoscopic novel U.S.A. , a trilogy published between 1930 and 1936 , John Dos Passos offered a descriptive line that has always stayed with me . America , he wrote , is " a public library full of ... dog-eared history books with protests scrawled on the margins . " Historical writing at its best is composed not only of facts but of thoughts and directions . And in this fast-paced country , where currents are very much subject to abrupt change , it is often hard for a history book to take root . As every published historian knows , no book is the last word . Some books , however , do stand the test of time to become pillars that ca n't be toppled by revisionist trends . That is the case with the texts I 've chosen to represent the years 1945 to 1974 . No amount of fashionable deconstruction can pale their relevance . The excellence of the research and the elegance of the prose in these classics reflect the highest standard of enduring scholarship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fresh . Protests there may be , but derailments ? Not likely . <p> The books I 've chosen are works of history - not memoirs , novels , or contemporary accounts . That criterion forced me to leave out some superb books about the Cold War era , from Dean Acheson 's Present at the Creation : My Years in the State Department and Arthur M. Schlesinger 's A Thousand Days : John E Kennedy in the White House to James Baldwin 's Go Tell It on the Mountain and Joyce Carol Oates 's Them . Also absent from this list are essayists ' works that changed the way we live : Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson , for example , and The Feminine Mystique , by Betty Friedan . The list of excellent books written in and about postwar America would be long and certainly varied . It was not an era for the weak-willed or apathetic , starting as it did with the first use of atomic weapons and continuing through McCarthyism , the Korean War , agitation and violence over civil rights , feminism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rise of environmentalism . <p> In the decades following World War II , Dos Passos turned to American history to make sense of modern times , writing , for example , The Head and Heart of Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Wilson 's War . Although he considered himself a " second-class historian , " he called the discipline " the greatest of the literary arts . " The titles I 've chosen , written by professional literary artists , deal with the years when Truman , Eisenhower , Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon were in the White House . In various ways , each captures the Cold War era , a time of unholy strengths and barely restrained fears . " Writing , " Dos Passes once said , " is like setting up milk bottles at fairs for people to throw baseballs at . " In choosing these books , I 've abandoned hardball analysis . Instead I 'm dusting off the milk bottles , standing them up straight and urging everybody to look at them . <p> Truman , by David McCullough ( 1992 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography of Harry S. Truman hit the top of the bestseller list in 1992 , the late President was suddenly thrust back into politics again . Filled with stories of both ordinary days and monumental ones in the life of the thirty-third President , the book vividly reminded America of the unique leader it had once had in Mr. Truman , a man complicated in his ambitions but never in his integrity . Thanks to the book , sparks flew in the 1992 presidential campaign , as George H. W. Bush , the Republican incumbent , and Bill Clinton , the Democratic contender , each compared himself to " Give ' Em Hell " Harry and vied strenuously to inherit his mantle . Thanks to McCullough 's Truman , it is very much a living legacy . <p> When it comes to sheer elegance of historical prose , David McCullough is practically unmatched . With Truman , for which he won a Pulitzer Prize , he presents a historically balanced and vigorously researched biography of the man who came from nowhere , so it seemed , to become President on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly did n't act like a neophyte as he faced Cold War crises in Korea and Berlin and recognized the new state of Israel . One must be awed by his implementation of a new construct for national security , as he created the CIA , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the National Security Council , and the Department of Defense . He also made the Marshall Plan a reality and was a leader in the creation of the United Nations . When Truman was preparing to leave office in 1952 , Winston Churchill told him , " You , more than any other man , have saved Western civilization . " <p> Strategies of Containment : A Critical Appraisal of Postwar American National Security Policy , by John Lewis Gaddis ( 1982 ; Oxford ) . The theme of Strategies of Containment , John Lewis Gaddis 's seminal book on the American response to the Cold War , is found in the title itself . During the span of U.S.-U.S.S.R. hostility from 1945 to 1982 ( when the book was published ) , America did n't have just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Presidents . Strategies of Containment , a follow-up to Gaddis 's influential first book , The United States and the Origins of the Cold War , 1941-1947 , remains the most respected work on the political aspects , domestic and international , of the struggle at its height . <p> The book is neatly organized , with at least one chapter covering the doctrine of each presidential administration . Gaddis 's prose is clear , and his analysis is remarkably impartial . His chapters on the Eisenhower " New Look " initiatives are especially intriguing , showing the former general planning for peace , without backing down an inch . As Gaddis said recently , writing about the Cold War when it was still going on was something like writing a history of World War II before the D-day invasion . That does n't mean that Strategies of Containment is outdated , though . A better history of U.S. motivations in the Cold War is not likely to be written any time soon . Gaddis , now a professor at Yale University , is currently working on a much-anticipated biography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having granted the dean of diplomatic historians full access to his personal papers . <p> An Unfinished Life : John F. Kennedy , 1917-1963 , by Robert Dallek ( 2003 ; Back Bay ) . In the late 1990s , after years of discussion , the family of John F. Kennedy accorded the biographer Robert Dallek , a professor at Boston University , special access to papers never before opened to any historian , documents related to the health of the late President . The material , which Dallek reviewed with a physician , revealed that when President , Kennedy was racked with serious illnesses and ailments . The public was aware that he had had back problems but never knew the extent to which he was being held together by constant medical attention and a bagful of pharmaceutical drugs . Although the medical revelations form only one section of the finely drawn An Unfinished Life , they color Dallek 's portrait of Kennedy throughout , his depiction of a President who was decidedly not all that the public perceived . Sometimes he was an even greater man , sometimes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend of JFK . Dallek does a particularly responsible job in tracing Kennedy 's foreign policy , ultimately the single most influential aspect of the unfinished Presidency . The sections on the construction of the Berlin Wall , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the relationship between President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev , and Vietnam are all beautifully told . <p> Crabgrass Frontier : The Suburbanization of the United States , by Kenneth T. Jackson ( 1985 ; Oxford ) . Brooklyn was once a suburb . And so was Harlem , for that matter . As Crabgrass Frontier , Kenneth Jackson 's rich urban history , shows , suburbs reflect not merely how cities look but how they grow and , more compelling , how individuals improve their lot in life . Although planned residential expansion is nothing new , Jackson demonstrates through original research that it became a social phenomenon in the mid-twentieth century after the federal government developed massive programs to make mortgage money easily available , and so encourage individual home ownership . In a narrative filled with sprightly detail , he shows the reader how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is built . This is a book not of statistics but of practicalities . Jackson mourns the decline of the center city in America , but he understands why it happened . A professor at Columbia , he himself has a house in Westchester County , as well as an apartment in the heart of the city . <p> The best thing about reading Crabgrass Frontier is that one will never take a boring drive into or out of town again . Jackson tells us there is always something to see for those who know how to read the history that is written on the outskirts . <p> Last Train to Memphis : The Rise of Elvis Presley and Careless Love : The Unmaking of Elvis Presley , by Peter Guralnick ( 1994 and 1999 ; Back Bay ) . We all think we know Elvis Presley , the poor boy from Tupelo , Mississippi , who fell in love with what were called in his teenage years , " race records . " Played only by black radio stations , race records reflected the rocking blues sound of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned much of what he knew about singing from those disks . In 1953 , at 18 , he walked into Sun Records and asked to record a song for his mother 's birthday . With that the music world discovered Elvis Presley and saw in him , as Greil Marcus wrote in Mystery Train , " a great artist , a great rocker , a great purveyor of shock , a great heart throb , a great bore , a great symbol of potency , a great ham , a great nice person , and , yes , a great American . " The question still outstanding was , When would Elvis discover Elvis - and what would he find when he did ? Peter Guralnick 's poignant books finally look for the answers to the many questions surrounding that boy we thought we knew , the answers Elvis himself never found . <p> Last Train to Memphis covers Elvis 's rise to stardom , leaving off with his induction into the Army in 1958 . His beloved mother died at almost the same time , and so the turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1958 , the day Presley arrived in Germany , when his life began its slow but unmistakable process of disintegration . Guralnick 's two-volume biography is an intricate masterwork that touches on everything from Jim Crow to the sexual revolution to the terrors fame holds for those as ill prepared as Elvis was . <p> Bearing the Cross : Martin Luther King , Jr. , and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , by David J. Garrow ( 1986 ; Perennial ) . Bearing the Cross traces the Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr . ' s emergence as the leader of the civil rights movement in America and simultaneously charts his personal struggles as an African-American man trying to make sense of his own life during that era . David Garrow , who had written Protest at Selma , was inspired by transcriptions of Dr. King 's sermons to search for the emotional spirit behind his subject . He succeeded by bringing to King 's life a level of scholarly research that will probably never be matched . <p> King was the son of a minister , born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Boston University . A self-effacing and thoughtful man , he was often frustrated by the job of governing the complicated personalities within the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . Ultimately , he had more success as the spiritual head of the movement than as its commanding general . Trying to decide exactly what his role was , though , clouded the sanguine outlook he so eloquently expressed in the 1963 " I Have a Dream " speech . By 1968 , Garrow shows , events had corroded King 's original optimism , making him thoroughly disillusioned and indeed , pessimistic about America 's chances for mending the torn relationship between the races . He was assassinated that year , and he did not live to see the progress that was built on the ideas of nonviolence he laid down . <p> Carry Me Home : Birmingham , Alabama : The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution , by Diane McWhorter ( 2001 ; Simon &; Schuster ) . In Carry Me Home , Diane McWhorter describes in intimate terms the face-off between whites and blacks in the South during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city that became known around the world as a continuing , deadly battleground in that struggle , Birmingham , Alabama , or , as it was known from the 1940s to the 1960s , " Bomb-ingham . " The deadly explosion at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church was the worst of the violence , killing four young girls , but the city saw many such attacks and protests . One resulted in the incarceration of King and the composition of his famous " Letter From the Birmingham Jail . " Carry Me Home introduces a new cast of characters to the understanding of the confrontation there , as McWhorter , with the greatest sensitivity , describes the individuals who pushed events , often from the shadows . For example , she shows that in the white community it was not the blue-collar core but an unlikely combination of Northern industrial interests and outwardly respectable local religious groups that roiled the violence and sometimes even set it in motion . <p> McWhorter based Carry Me Home on copious new research yet anchored it with her own recollections of growing up white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about which she writes . For that reason , her book answers the question of why , by examining in the most specific terms possible who . <p> A Bright Shining Lie : John Paul Vann and America In Vietnam , by Neil Sheehan ( 1988 ; Vintage ) . To understand how the apparently invincible United States military could have been so badly humbled in the Vietnam War , Neil Sheehan made a meticulous investigation of the life and career of one of its most capable officers , Lt. Col. John Paul Vann . Like Sheehan , then a newspaper correspondent , Vann arrived in Vietnam in 1962 , early in the game in terms of U.S. involvement . Courageous , confident , and wholly capable , Vann was the living embodiment of the American cold warrior of the early 1960s ; he had many thousands of counterparts , both in Vietnam as the buildup continued and in Washington . However , as Sheehan describes so skillfully in A Bright Shining Lie , something went wrong . After Vann 's military career collapsed , he returned to Vietnam as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsively immoral , he was at once the symbol of America 's hidden weaknesses during the Cold War and , ultimately , one of its most immediate victims . Vividly written , A Bright Shining Lie is both an action story and a haunting analysis of the most bitter American tragedy of the Cold War . <p> The Years of Lyndon Johnson : The Path to Power ( 1982 ) , Means of Ascent ( 1990 ) , and Master of the Senate ( 2002 ) , by Robert A. Caro ( Vintage ) . Though Robert Caro is a biographer , he does n't merely write about celebrated lives . Instead he fills in a broad canvas with faces , institutions , and places , and somewhere in the center of it all , he sets the crucial figure that affected all the rest and was , of course , affected by them . To date , Caro has completed three volumes on ( or all around ) his greatest subject , Lyndon Baines Johnson . The Path to Power was about Johnson 's early years in the Texas Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Representatives and learning the ropes in Washington ; and Master of the Senate , about his handling those ropes as though they were the strings of a puppeteer . Master of the Senate ends in 1959 , leaving Johnson 's Vice Presidency and his Presidency for a fourth book , on which Caro is now working . <p> The Lyndon Johnson Caro presents is not always nice ; in fact he is downright crude a lot of the time . For that reason , Caro has been charged with having something against the thirty-fifth President . As a matter of fact , Caro started the project in the 1970s , when , having just finished a book about Robert Moses , whom he did not admire , he decided to write next about someone he did . He chose Johnson . The disturbing truth about Johnson and his methods was as shocking to Caro at first as he makes it to the reader . Inasmuch as any historian can be , Robert Caro is intently and admirably objective about his subject . He manages to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single most effective person working in Washington , overseeing the passage , in 1957 , of the first new civil rights law since Reconstruction . <p> Nixon Agonistes : The Crisis of the Self-Made Man , by Carry Wills ( 1970 ; Mariner ) . Nixon Agonistes is about " Richard Nixon and how he got that way , " a critic wrote when the book came out , before Watergate and the infamous resignation . In fact the book was written when Nixon was at the very zenith of his career , a first-term President secure in the hearts of " the silent majority . " Because Nixon was regarded as a staunch and acceptably conservative Republican , Wills 's argument that he was actually a well-disguised liberal was shocking 35 years ago . It has become quite acceptable since . The book is about more than the mysterious Mr. Nixon though ; it glides through a wide-ranging discussion of American-style democracy , treating the electoral process as a cultural phenomenon . To this day Nixon Agonistes retains its original sting . It 's a beautifully crafted book by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-range look at the nose-to-nose squabbling that is American politics . <p> As part of the explanation of Nixon 's peculiar character , Wills cites the President 's habitual seeking out of enemies , surely the mark of a man who helped create the Cold War and was himself created by it . There is a footnote , however : When Nixon 's " enemies list " was made public in the wake of the Watergate investigations , Carry Wills was on it . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The New Television Set , by Norman Rockwell , 1949 . <p> By Douglas Brinkley <p> <p> His books include The Unfinished Presidency : Jimmy Carter 's Journey Beyond the White House and Tour of Duty : John Kerry and the Vietnam War . <p>
