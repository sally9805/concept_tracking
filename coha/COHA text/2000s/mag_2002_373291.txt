After a few epic-size Hollywood films ( Erin Brockovich , Traffic , Ocean 's Eleven ) , director Steven Soderbergh has gone small . Full Frontal , his terrific new movie , is intimate and innovative . It boasts rules of Dogma-like rigor : the budget was $2 million ; the shoot took just three weeks ; most of it was photographed ( by the director ) on video ; the stars were responsible for their own makeup ; no limos or trailers were allowed . He also constructed a Chinese box of a **32;14920;TOOLONG . The result is his liveliest experiment since the strenuously weird Schizopolis six years ago  --  except that this one works . <P> A tale of articulate people with the gift of hurting the ones they care about , Full Frontal reminds viewers that there 's room for stories about grownups  --  their wayward loves ; their career blips ; their relation to the media maw ; their takes on race , pets , outsize vibrators and Brad Pitt  --  told with inventive wit in a dozen distinctive voices . <P> The plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tart-tongued management type Lee ( Catherine Keener ) is ready to walk out on mousy Carl ( David Hyde Pierce ) , a magazine writer who moonlights with plays and film scripts . His Hitler play opens tonight . His movie is being shot right now with movie star Francesca ( Julia Roberts ) and rising TV actor Calvin ( Blair Underwood ) . The film 's producer , Gus ( David Duchovny ) , turns 40 today and is expected at a birthday party a few hours after he gets a massage from Lee 's sister Linda ( Mary McCormack ) . Everyone collides , sexually or emotionally , with everyone else . Collides and contuses . You can see the welts , or rather hear them , in the dialogue by poet-playwright Coleman Hough ( a real find ) ; it laces endearments with insults . It cuts as it caresses . <P> There 's a taut grandeur to Full Frontal , in part because Julia the box-office queen is encased in an ensemble cast of attractive , accomplished actors . And mainly because Hough recombines devious devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate ) letter left to be discovered , two sisters involved in shady dalliances in separate rooms at the same hotel . Hough wraps this all in brittle wit ; imagine the coolest cocktail conversation , then put it in a movie . <P> Here you will learn : how your porn-star name is chosen ( your first pet 's name plus the name of the first street you lived on ) , how a boss can intimidate an employee ( by telling him to stand on one leg on a chair while listing African countries ) and whether a black man will ever be able to kiss a white woman onscreen ( we wo n't say ) . All this local intelligence supports the view that people make a mess of their lives , then try to clean up by sweeping that mess under a rug of propriety , hostility or banter . <P> As Carl 's Hitler ( the very funny Nicky Katt ) explains to Eva Braun , " I 'm too committed to my work to maintain a relationship ... I 'm taking a swim in Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive egocentrics will ever stick their toe in Lake Anybody Else . For an invigorating summer dip in the waters of Lake Smart , dive into Full Frontal . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
