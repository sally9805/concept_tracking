Dreier see article this issue met with Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray in New York to found the Socit Anonyme , the first museum of modern art in America . Initially infused with the Dada spirit , due to the artistic orientation of her collaborators , the Socit Anonyme was for Dreier a lifelong mission within which she would support and promote a wide range of European and American modernism . Carried forward by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next several years the Socit Anonyme would mount no fewer than 80 innovative exhibitions , among them the first solo shows in America of work by Kandinsky , Archipenko , Jacques Villon , David Burliuk , John Storrs and many others . The exhibitions were often accompanied by lectures , symposia , performances , publications and education programs . In short order , a collection began to form , with much of the work being donated by artists or purchased at modest cost by Dreier .

She continued to expand the collection over the course of the next decade and several hundred works were added from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually comprised over 1,000 works and included major pieces by such leading figures as Duchamp , Brancusi , Mondrian , Malevich , Lissitzky and many others . While it can not be said that the Socit Anonyme collection fell into obscurity over the course of the next half-century , neither can it be claimed that the Yale University Art Gallery made major efforts to promote or draw attention to the collection , its unique character and its numerous achievements . In late April 2006 , the exhibition " The Socit Anonyme : Modernism for America " opened at the Hammer Museum at the University of California , Los Angeles , the first stop in a four-city tour that terminates at the Yale University Art Gallery . Organized by Yale curator Jennifer C. Gross , it marks the first time a selection of works from the Socit Anonyme collection has traveled outside of New Haven . The exhibition does not simply display the 200 selected pieces , but employs them in such a way as to permit the story of the Socit Anonyme to unfold as the viewer moves from one gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glass-fronted cases replete with correspondence and ephemera of various kinds are strategically placed in order to promote a better understanding of the nature of Dreier 's enterprise . In contrast to its " rival " institution , the Museum of Modern Art , whose founding it anticipated by nine years , the Socit Anonyme was a modest , low-budget operation . It took up brief , temporary residence in a series of rented rooms in midtown Manhattan in the 1920s and then borrowed exhibition space from galleries , museums and schools . Dreier made several trips to Europe and thereafter maintained contact with the artists and dealers whom she met , who became her " collaborators . " The global nature of the current art world seems far less remarkable in light of the international communication and interchange that took place during the interwar period within Dreier 's West Redding , Conn. , mailbox . While the installation of paintings in a few of the exhibition 's galleries may strike viewers as cacophonous and awkward , with poorly orchestrated juxtapositions , this effect was purposeful on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions . Dreier was involved from a young age with Theosophy ( a 19th-century belief system that sought to realize the spiritual unity in all things ) , and was inspired by the reading of Kandinsky 's Theosophy-based Concerning the Spiritual in Art ( 1912 ) to synthesize the esthetic and spiritual . She believed that " cosmic forces " were at work in modern art , assuming a wide variety of forms and carrying even those with ordinary talent to great heights . She therefore sought through the Socit Anonyme to celebrate modernist work in all of its manifestations , without prejudice , hierarchy or categorization of any kind . In Socit Anonyme exhibitions , the works of artists from many nations were intermingled ; paintings by major figures were installed beside those by unknowns . This approach was of course diametrically opposed to that , for example , of the Museum of Modern Art , which from its inception was geared to scholarship , art history and a focus on major masters . The Socit Anonyme may therefore be seen as revisionist before the fact and poses what today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the space of the exhibition , any number of wholly unfamiliar artists-a large percentage of them women-are brought to light , and many seem deserving of further study . // Unknown artist : Socit Anonyme Inc. signboard , n.d. , paint on panel , 36 by 24 inches . All irorks this article Socit Anonyme Collection , Yale Unirersity Art Gallery . // Dreier was born in 1877 to a family of wealthy German immigrants living in Brooklyn . She studied painting from a young age , and traveled frequently to France and Germany , where she was exposed to modern art as early as 1907-08 , although her understanding remained limited until the early teens . Two of her paintings were exhibited in the Armory Show in 1913 , in which Duchamp 's descending nude created a great stir . Dreier was among those who voted against showing Duchamp 's Fountain in the Salon of Independent Artists of 1917 . She wrote to him shortly thereafter , however , praising his originality , strength of character and " spiritual sensitiveness " and admitting that the concept of the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned Tu m ' ( 1918 ) , which was to be Duchamp 's last painting , for her library . An unlikely duo , the matronly , visionary American and the sophisticated French intellectual nine years her junior became lifelong friends and collaborators , linked through the Socit Anonyme. // Wassily Kandinsky : Multicolored Circle , 1921 , oil on canvas , 54 by 70 7/8 inches . c ARS/ADAGP. // Although the exhibition opens with a small orientation gallery filled with photographs , gallery announcements and assorted bits of background information , nowhere is the name " Socit Anonyme " explained . It apparently originated at a meeting to discuss the " experimental museum " as a suggestion from Man Ray , who thought the term " anonymous society " in French would be appropriate for an internationally minded , altruistic endeavor organized by artists for artists . When Duchamp explained that the French term did not translate directly into English , but carried the same meaning as the American word " incorporated , " he , Man Ray and Dreier liked it even better , delighting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist name to an antimaterialist endeavor ( the irony was compounded a few months later ; the name was given the redundant appendage , " Inc. , " when it was officially sanctioned by the State of New York ) . Dada humor and spirit also played a significant role in the Socit Anonyme 's inaugural exhibition , which opened in two rented rooms in a brownstone at 19 East 47th Street on Apr. 30 , 1920 . This exhibition is re-created in the second gallery of the current installation . On display is a highly diverse assortment of work : paintings by European artists Jacques Villon , Archipenko , Juan Gris , Heinrich Vogler and van Gogh ; paintings by American artists Joseph Stella ( a majestic version of Brooklyn Bridge ) , Patrick Henry Bruce and James Daugherty ; a Brancusi sculpture ; and pieces by New York Dadaists , among them Duchamp , Man Bay and Morton Schamberg . In his design of the installation of the inaugural show , Duchamp covered the gallery walls with pale blue oilcloth and tinted the fireplace and woodwork to match ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue . As in the original installation , the floor was covered in gray ribbed rubber , which apparently had made the New York gallery seem like a neutral , quasi-industrial space . Remarkably , Duchamp called for all of the paintings to be framed by paper lace-a " feminine , " doilylike trim.2 On the one hand , the cheap paper frames parodied the practice of bestowing value upon painted works by enclosing them in ornate frames . On the other hand , as seen at the Hammer , the paper lace frames unite all of the works on display as an installation , while compromising the power and seriousness of the individual works ( i.e. , they look quite funny ) . This is particularly true of those paintings , like the Archipenko and the Gris , that are extremely " masculine " in feel ( thus engaging a sense of androgyny that anticipates the drawing of a moustache and goatee on the image of the Mona Lisa , which Duchamp was to do later that year back in Paris ) .3 As a further point , the stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of the paintings contained within . The next gallery at the Hammer represents the extended series of solo shows organized by the Socit Anonyme by focusing on small presentations of work by six artists : Kandinsky , Klee , Heinrich Campendonk , Fernand Lger , Louis Eilshemius and Stella . Kandinsky , sublimely represented by , among other works , his early painting The Waterfall ( 1909 ) and the Bauhaus work Multicolored Circle ( 1921 ) was of particular significance to Dreier . Motivated by her Theosophical beliefs , she gravitated throughout her life toward a spiritually-based abstraction in both her style of painting and the work she collected.4 Dreier visited Kandinsky in Germany and France on many occasions , maintained an avid correspondence with him and made him honorary vice president of the Socit Anonyme from 1925 until his death in 1944 ( Duchamp occupied the position of secretary ) . The undisputed gem among Dreier 's mail is the postcard , in a glass case in the last room of the exhibition , jointly written to Dreier from the bar-restaurant Oasis in Montparnasse in 1933 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , in which they relate that they are eating blini and thinking of her . // Kurt Schwitters : Carnival , 1947 , collage , 10 by 7 inches . c ABS/VG Bild-Kunst , Bonn . // Stefi Kiesler : Typo-Plastic , ca. 1925-30 , black and red typewriter ink on paper , 10 5/8 by 8 inches . // The large gallery space that follows is devoted to work featured in the " International Exhibition of Modern Art " held at the Brooklyn Museum , Nov. 19,1926-Jan. 1,1927 , the most ambitious public program organized by the Socit Anonyme.6 Determined to demonstrate the vitality of modern art , Dreier gathered more than 300 works by 106 artists representing some 19 countries . She organized the show with advice from a wide and impressive team of consultants , among them Duchamp , Lger , Kandinsky , Campendonk , Schwitters , Stieglitz and Anton Giulio Bragaglia . A highly important collaborator was Herwarth Walden of Berlin 's Der Sturm Gallery , who was one of Dreier 's longtime mentors . About one quarter of the artists in the exhibition were American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many were from the Stieglitz circle , including Stieglitz himself ( he showed " Equivalents " and , at Dreier 's invitation , gave a public talk ) . The exhibition is also notable for having featured the American debuts of both Miro and Mondrian. // Laszlo Peri : Room ( Space Construction ) , 1920-21 , tempera on composition board , 39 by 30 inches . // As it was the most significant presentation of modern art in America since the Armory Show in 1913 , and given that it traveled to three additional venues , one can not help but wonder why this remarkable exhibition is not better known.6 One of the reasons might be that while certain Paris-based modernists are represented , among them Gleizes , Metzinger , Duchamp , Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Picabia ( with a remarkable , snakeskin-framed landscape populated by macaroni palm trees with green feather fronds ) , Dreier clearly favored German and Russian art and tended to avoid the French avantgarde , which was preferred by American collectors . In the 124-page , profusely illustrated catalogue that Dreier prepared to accompany the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by a modest work on paper , " A middle-aged gentleman who started life full of enthusiasm and helped to create the cubist movement , which , however , is far bigger than he is . He is a master in his own way . Though a fighter in his youth , he settled down to retirement as far as the world of art goes today painting his own individual pictures . " // Erika Giovanna Klien : Abstraction , 1926 , aqueous paint , either gouache or size , on linen , 39 by 78 inches . // In addition to the fact that she put people off with her unpopular preferences and opinions , another reason Dreier 's Brooklyn show fell off the radar might have been the ahistorical nature of her installations . Like the 1913 Armory Show , A.E . Gallatin 's Gallery of Living Art , which opened at New York University in 1927 , was organized according to artistic movements or styles , which helped make unfamiliar art somewhat more intelligible to audiences . By contrast , Dreier avoided grouping the art in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often separated . Major and minor artists and greater and lesser works were freely integrated , while national boundaries were ignored . As the quality of the work is consistently high , the visitor to the Hammer finds much that fascinates and delights in the intermingling of known and unfamiliar artists . Particularly noteworthy among the latter are the Hungarian Laszlo Peri , Austrian-born Erika Giovanna Klien and Stefi Kiesler ( the wife of Frederick Kiesler ) , and Lotte Reiniger , a German filmmaker whose extraordinary full-length silhouette animation , The Adventures of Prince Achmed ( 1926 ) , a surprise highlight of the exhibition , was included because it was among the Socit Anonyme 's " educational initiatives , " shown in 1931 at an event the Socit sponsored at The New School for Social Research called " Art of the Future . " With regard to the installation at the Hammer , it should be noted that liberties were taken with the hanging policy of the Socit Anonyme : at numerous points , conventional groupings of works are seen , as in sections devoted to work by artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Styl and to the work of Kurt Schwitters. // Francis Picabia : Midi ( Promenade des Anglais ) , ca. 1923-26 , oil , feathers , macaroni and leather on caniax in a snakeskin frame by Pierre Legrain , 21 by 39 inches . c ARS/ADAGP. // That a large section of one of the final galleries is devoted to Duchamp is important to the telling of the story of the Socit Anonyme , as he played such an important role . While his friendship and advice were always of value to Dreier , his significance to the organization seems to have been greatest at its very beginning and in its late years , when he assisted Dreier with the transfer of the collection to Yale , the preparation of the first collection catalogue ( compiled with George Heard Hamilton and completed in 1950 ) and the dissolution of her estate , for which he served as executor . At the time of her death , Dreier had the largest collection of Duchamp 's work after the Arensbergs . Although the Large Glass , which was long in her possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of Art , the remarkable Tu m ' ' , which is included in the present exhibition , went with her estate to Yale . If a major exhibition devoted to Katherine S. Dreier and the Socit Anonyme was long in coming , it was worth waiting for and has come at an opportune moment . At a time when modernism seems to have grown stale , locked in the past and all too familiar , the Socit Anonyme 's openness to " great and small talent " and to modernism in its various manifestations throws open the door to fresh perspectives and a wide and diverse community of individuals , injecting new life into art-historical inquiry and providing a broader view of modernism than the one to which we have become accustomed . In a period of rampant globalization , the fact that modernism in the period between the world wars attained an almost universal dimension is worth remembering . The fact that a woman artist with limited resources working fundamentally alone , but soliciting support and advice from others , built a monumental collection and legacy is inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Modernism for America " has put an end to the anonymity of the Socit Anonyme and restored an important chapter of modernism to its rightful place . Whereas previously only about a half-dozen works from the Socit Anonyme were on view at any time in the Yale University Art Gallery , after the exhibition 's return the curators are planning to devote special galleries to the permanent display of selections from the collection , assuring that the story will continue to be told.7 " The Socit Anonyme : Modernism for America " is currently on view at the Hammer Museum , Los Angeles Apr. 23-Aug. 20 , 20061 K mil then travel to the Phillips Collection , Washington , B.C.

Viewed as safer than street drugs like heroin , prescription pain pill misuse is on the increase in all age ranges . Frequently abused prescription pain medications include hydrocodone ( Lorcet , Lortab , Vicodin ) , oxycodone ( OxyContin , Percocet , Percodan ) , codeine ( Tylenol 2s , 3s , and 4s ) , fentanyl ( Duragesic ) , and morphine ( MS Contin ) . These drugs are commonly prescribed for acute pain ( for example , tooth , post-injury , or surgery pain ) or chronic pain ( for example , back pain or pain associated with malignancy ) . Methadone , which is used both for the treatment of opioid dependence and for pain , is rising as a primary drug of abuse as well ( Maxwell , 2006 ) . <p> Statistics over the past five years have shown that the misuse of prescription pain medications by students in grades 8 through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tobacco , alcohol , and steroids has decreased . Data from admissions to treatment facilities show that heroin as a primary drug of choice decreased from 2000 to 2005 ; during that same time period , admissions for other opioids increased ( Center for Substance Abuse Research , 2007 ) . According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( NSDUH ) report ( NSDUH , 2006 ) , nonmedical use of prescription pain medications has increased among young adults ages 18 to 25 . More people initiated use of prescription pain relievers in 2004 than began using marijuana or cocaine . Often these drugs are relatively easy to obtain , are viewed as safer than illegal drugs , and are less shameful to use . Although prescription pain pills are from the same class of drugs as heroin , the difficulty of diagnosis of abuse and dependence on them is increased because of their legitimate use and surrounding misconceptions . <p> National Center of Health Statistics ( Maxwell , 2006 ) data indicated that narcotic analgesics such as hydrocodone , oxycodone , and methadone were more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either heroin or cocaine . The 213 percent increase in methadone accidental poisoning deaths between 1999 and 2003 was associated with the use of methadone as a pain medication rather than in opioid treatment programs ( Maxwell , 2006 ) . Such alarming statistics about the increase in the prevalence of prescription pain medication misuse with the corresponding damage to individuals and to society calls for study and better services . <p> Individuals who abuse pain medication present a unique population in their sociodemographic characteristics and drug use patterns . More than half of the new users of prescription pain relievers are female , the average age of first nonmedical use of pain relievers was 25 , and almost 90 percent of new users are white ( NSDUH , 2006 ) . This increase in the abuse of opioids by this group raises the need to target this population for treatment and to examine the effectiveness of existing treatment modalities . <p> L : BUPRENORPHINE/NALOXONE AS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT Buprenorphine/naloxone , is an evidence-based pharmacological treatment that offers a new and different option for treatment of opioid dependence . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abuse . It has been demonstrated to be effective with heroin dependence ( Fiellin et al. , 2002 ; Ling et al. , 1998 ; Prescrire Editorial Staff , 2006 ) , and studies are now being conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) to demonstrate its effectiveness with those dependent on prescription pain medication ( see NIDA Clinical Trials Network at http : **41;3590;TOOLONG ) . Beginning in October 2002 , physicians who take a sanctioned course can prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone as a sublingual tablet for opioid addiction from a private office rather than exclusively through specialized drug treatment centers . This has increased accessibility to patients and decreased stigma associated with drug treatment . <p> Buprenorphine/naloxone has numerous clinical advantages . Because of its unique makeup it can be used in two valuable ways : detoxification and stabilization or maintenance . For detoxification , buprenorphine/naloxone allows for alleviation of withdrawal symptoms , even on an outpatient basis , while inhibiting further use and misuse of those drugs while on the medication . Physical functioning is restored quickly , freeing the person to direct energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option is a pharmacologically supported stabilization and maintenance period . This intervention provides dependent individuals with an extended time in which they can accomplish necessary habit changes ( both cognitive and behavioral ) . Abstinence is supported because the medication interrupts and inhibits the effect of opioids in the brain . <p> Buprenorphine/naloxone is effective because it relieves withdrawal symptoms , does not make the person feel high , interferes with the use of other opioids , and is very difficult to misuse . It is the physical withdrawal symptoms in opioid addicts that significantly interfere with discontinuing use of the drug . Because buprenorphine/naloxone is a mild agonist , a substance abuser does not need to be fully detoxified to receive the medication . <p> Buprenorphine/naloxone is safer and less prone to abuse than are other opioids , including methadone , because of its ceiling effect . Taking more of it does not make a person " higher , " and it is safer because there is no increasing effect on respiratory depression , which is often the cause of overdose ( Bowersox , 1995 ) . Furthermore , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a heightened effect by doubling up with other opioids . Buprenorphine/naloxone blocks the effects of other opioids , which means that if an individual uses a drug such as oxycodone or heroin while taking the medication , there is no effect from that drug . In addition , this medication has a built-in mechanism that discourages misuse through crushing , snorting , or injecting . If used in any of these ways , the effects of buprenorphine are not felt and the naloxone ( which has no clinical effect when taken sublingually as prescribed ) is felt in full force , causing the individual to go into immediate withdrawal . <p> L : CLINICAL TREATMENT With the growing trend of dependence on prescription pain medications and the increase in use of pharmacological treatments of addictions , new treatment models are needed to address and support long-term recovery . At the West Virginia University Department of Behavioral Medicine , a model for treatment of opioid dependence that uses a combination of two evidence-based treatments is being offered to opioid-dependent clients . The majority of these clients are dependent on prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group that includes treatment with buprenorphine/ naloxone and 12-step facilitation therapy ( Nowinski , Baker , &; Carroll , 1994 ) . During the first half hour of a weekly 90-minute group , clients see the physician , report on required 12-step meeting attendance , complete random drug screens , and receive education about the medication . During the subsequent 60 minutes they engage in a group that teaches about concepts important to 12-step participation . Objectives of 12-step facilitation therapy include identifying and changing cognitions related to drug use , learning to deal with emotional states that contribute to use , developing behaviors that support abstinence , increasing healthy social and relational supports , and taking part in activities that enhance hope and trust . Journaling is encouraged as a way of increasing engagement and self-reflection . This 60-minute segment ends with a commitment from group members regarding their recovery activities for the week . Clients participate in the weekly group until they have 90 days of abstinence and a sponsor . At that time they are referred to a monthly group that consists of meeting with the physician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Individualized treatment planning addresses issues such as length of treatment and other specialized needs . <p> L : IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE For social workers addressing the problem of prescription pain pill dependence , there are four primary areas of intervention : treatment , education , advocacy , and research . Treatment should be provided through a multidisciplinary , abstinence-based approach , with physicians and social workers collaborating by using evidence-based treatments such as those described earlier . <p> Education is essential to refer or provide effective treatment to this population . Social workers need to be knowledgeable about the increase in the dependence on prescription pain pills and about the role that buprenorphine/naloxone can play in the recovery process , including its strengths and limitations . The goal of buprenorphine/naloxone therapy in the treatment of opioid addiction is to prevent withdrawal symptoms and to suppress cravings for opioids . The medication , however , does not treat addictive patterns and behaviors . It gives the addicted person the support to stop using drugs , but it does not provide social support systems or alternate patterns of behavior and cognitions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an individual can just stop using the drug the problem will be solved . To the nave user and her or his family , the social systems , and even the prescribing clinician , buprenorphine/naloxone may give the illusion of " fixing " the problem by simply helping an individual to stop using opioids . All can be seduced into believing that once the drug is out of a person 's system the individual no longer suffers the negative effects of drug addiction . <p> Advocacy is needed to ensure the effective use of this medication and to inhibit its misuse . Because it is less strictly regulated than methadone , buprenorphine/naloxone has an initial advantage of availability . However , this availability has its downside . Without the necessary support and education , clients are at risk of not receiving needed therapy and emphasis on life changes . A combined medical management and abstinence-based therapeutic approach offers both the physiological support for detoxification and maintenance and the support for lifestyle changes necessary for enduring recovery . Long-term relief from drug addiction can be achieved by treating the withdrawal symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive and emotional responses , and family and social systems that support long-term recovery . <p> Another disadvantage of less strict regulation of buprenorphine/naloxone is the increase in its street availability . Although the drug has some inherent safety mechanisms , it still can be bartered and sold for other drugs . This medication can be misused in a way that supports ongoing addiction to other drugs of abuse . For example , an individual may use buprenorphine/naloxone to prevent withdrawal during a time that he or she can not find or afford the drug of choice , only to return to the use of that drug when it becomes available . It can also be used during the week , with the plan to return to " partying " on the weekend . <p> Research is needed to increase social workers ' understanding of the successful tools and protocols that are effective for the treatment of prescription drug abuse . For example , research could promote understanding of what doses of buprenorphine/ naloxone are most effective on the basis of a person 's level of tolerance of opioids . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needed to best promote long-term abstinence would provide more clear treatment protocols . <p> Buprenorphine/naloxone is an exciting new tool and , as is characteristic of all tools , it is used best with an understanding of its limitations . Although at times history has shown failure of promise with new pharmacological interventions , medications are showing an increasing role in the treatment of addiction to various drugs . Sometimes the failure of new promise is born out of misunderstanding of the best use of a new intervention . Buprenorphine/naloxone can be used for both detoxification and maintenance , but it does not do the hard work of cognition and habit change that is so important for overall success in the treatment of drug addiction . <p> Drug dependence is accompanied by habits that must be changed to support long-term health . Through an understanding of the changing trends in drugs of abuse and the strengths and limitations of new evidence-based treatments , social workers can support the use of these interventions in a way that is most advantageous to their clients and society .
