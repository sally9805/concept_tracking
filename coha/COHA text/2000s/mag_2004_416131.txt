Old multicolored roofing slate forms the unique backsplash. // An all-white kitchen is standard fare in many builder spec homes because of its broad appeal , but vhe.lack of color can look bland . Just ask Pat and Jane Bolin . They lived with a stark white kitchen for more than 10 years before beginning a makeover in their Dallas home . Continental Flair " Our kitchen was very predictable , " says Jane . " We wanted to do something different that reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bolins ' choices reflect their love of old things , especially from Europe . Happy with the original layout of the kitchen and existing appliances , the couple decided to splurge on the countertops and custom-painted cabinets , making the most of their budget . " We were able to use all our existing cabinets . We added a plate rack by cutting out the bottom of a cabinet and modified another to house the microwave , " says Jane . Decorative artist Reg Land painted the cabinets , giving them warmth and old-world flavor . " Although the kitchen is large , there is n't a lot of wallspace , so we put the art on the cabinets , " explains interior designer Cindy Zelazny-Rodenhaver . Updates All Around For the countertops , Jane and Pat selected a beautiful bluestone . A handchiseled finish makes the edges stand out . " It 's a labor-intensive process , but it 's the only way to get that look , " says Cindy . Putting in a bigger island was an easy decision for a couple who likes to cook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Cindy . " We made the island as large as it could be without putting a seam in the stone . " The countertop extends out to allow seating , a convenient feature with teenagers in the house . Handsome barstools slide underneath the countertop 's Hp . Everyone felt that a painted island might be too much of a good thing , so knotty pine forms the base . " It complements the cabinets , but it has its own personality , " says Jane . The island 's decorative legs serve a more utilitarian purpose . " We hollowed one out to run electricity to the island so it does n't show , " says Cindy . Just one more clever idea in a kitchen that 's full of them .
