As the sun sank slowly over the peaceful valley , Alfred the dog opened one eye . A slight breeze signaled that the temperature might finally be bearable . He got up slowly , stretched his legs , emerged from the shadow of the windmill where he had been hiding , and trotted across the grass . From the tall chimney of the house by the river , a young sparrow hawk followed the dog with its piercing eyes , but only for a few seconds . That prey was too large . The bird turned its head slowly , looking for another victim . Suddenly it let out a hoarse , powerful cry that awakened Grandma , who was stretched out on the couch in the living room . Grandma sat upright . " How could I doze off like that ? " she asked herself , rubbing her eyes . The events of the last few days came back to her . Arthur , her adored only grandson , had disappeared  --  just as her husband had done four years earlier , in the garden by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had searched the garden from one end to the other , torn the house apart , and called for him from all the neighboring hills , without finding a trace of her grandson . She imagined so many different explanations . . . perhaps extraterrestrials , for one . She imagined large green men coming down from the sky in theirUFO and kidnapping Arthur . She was almost sure of it . She missed his little blond head , tousled hair , and two large brown eyes , always with their look of wonder . She missed his voice , as sweet and fragile as a soap bubble . A tear made its lonely way down her cheek . She looked at the sky for a moment through the window . It was uniformly blue and desperately empty . No trace of extraterrestrials . She let out a long sigh and looked around her at the silent house . It was lucky that the sparrow hawk had woken her up . The coolness of the room and the hypnotic tick-tock of the clock had made it impossible to resist taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma perked up her ears . She was ready to interpret anything as a sign , a mark of hope . She was convinced that the sparrow hawk had seen or heard something , and she was n't entirely wrong . The bird was indeed declaring that he had heard something even before it was visible on the horizon . That something was a car , accompanied by a cloud of dust that glistened in the sunlight . The sparrow hawk scrutinized the car from the chimney top as if he were equipped with radar . Grandma listened carefully . She could hear a faint rumbling in the distance . The sparrow hawk let out two small cries , as if to indicate the number of passengers inside the car . Grandma turned her head slightly , the way you would turn an antenna in order to capture a signal . The engine noise could suddenly be heard everywhere , and the trees began to stir , echoing its horrible sound . The sparrow hawk decided it was time to leave , which was not a good sign . Perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place . Grandma jumped to her feet . There was no doubt about it  --  the sparrow hawk had sent her a signal . Grandma composed herself , straightened her dress over her considerable frame , and searched frantically for her slippers . The noise of the engine invaded the living room . Grandma stopped her search and headed toward the door wearing only one slipper , limping like an old pirate with a wooden leg . The engine stopped . The door of the car squealed as it opened , and two worn leather shoes emerged , stepping onto the gravel . Grandma reached the door and struggled with the key . " Why on earth did I lock the door ? " she grumbled to herself , her head down . She did not notice the two silhouettes outlined by the sun behind the door . The key rattled a little but finally turned in the lock . Grandma was so surprised by what she saw as the door swung open that she could not help letting out a little cry of horror . There was nothing particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except perhaps their bad taste . The lady was wearing a dress with large purple flowers , the man a plaid jacket of greenish yellow . It was hard on the eyes but nothing to scream about . Grandma stifled her cry and tried to convert it into a welcoming noise . " Surprise ! " chanted the couple , in perfect unison . Grandma spread her arms and tried as best she could to assume a natural-looking smile . Her mouth said Hello while her eyes said Help . " What a surprise , " she ended up blurting out . Arthur 's parents were standing in front of her , as real as a nightmare . Grandma continued to smile , blocking the front door like a soccer goalie . Since Grandma was not moving , not speaking , but only stood there with her strange smile , Arthur 's father was forced to ask the question that she feared the most . " Is Arthur here ? " he asked jovially , without a moment 's doubt about what the answer would be . Grandma smiled some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually lying . But Arthur 's father was waiting for a reply . So Grandma took a breath and said , " Did you have a good trip ? " This was not really the answer that Arthur 's father was waiting for , but he was a good driver , so he launched into a detailed account . " We took the shortcut to the west , " he explained . " The roads are narrow there , but according to my calculations we saved about twenty-five miles . Which means , given the price of a gallon of gas , that we  --  " " That we had to turn every three seconds for two hours , " complained Arthur 's mother . " The trip was a horror and I am grateful that Arthur did not have to suffer such punishment . " Then she added , " So where is he ? " " Who ? " asked Grandma , as if she were hearing voices .
