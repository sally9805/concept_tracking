Headnote New take-out and food delivery services make putting a healthy dinner on the table easy-and affordable // I knew things had gotten out of hand when our 10-year-old begged for a home-cooked meal . " Mommy , " she pleaded as I was throwing together some ham sandwiches to eat in the car after swim practice , " when are you going to make a real dinner again ? " Hey , it 's not like I did n't want to . But with work , family , exercise , volunteer obligations , and a dog to walk , my husband and I were always getting home late and starving-a setup for take-out or flung-together sandwiches . Getting a healthy meal on the table is a major challenge for most people these days . Maybe that 's why there has been a boom in new food services-companies that deliver groceries to you , storefronts where you assemble a meal to bring home , and everything in between . Online grocery shopping alone was a $2.4 billion industry in 2004-and is expected to grow to $6.5 billion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to me . But how fast , tasty , and healthy are these services , really ? We were just the guinea pigs to find outmy daughter , Lily ; my 44-year-old husband , Bill ; and me , an active , harried 42-year-old . So for 6 weeks we explored the world of convenience meals , trying an option each week in our Richmond , VA , home . Here 's how well they delivered-flavor , nutrition , convenience , and cost . GROCERIES DELIVERED The service You order online-or in some cases via a faxed list-and presto : A couple of days later , your groceries are at your front door . Local markets sometimes offer this option ; there are also regional and national companies , including Peapod , NetGrocer , and now Amazon . An important variable : Some deliver anything you can find in your local store , while the national biggies ship only shelf-stable products ( no perishables ) . How it worked When we lived in Boston a few years ago , we saved a couple of hours a week by using Peapod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The service chose fresher produce and meats than we did and charged just $7 to $10 for next-day delivery . It was lovely to get groceries without dragging a cranky toddler to the store . Peapod does n't deliver in our current hometown , so we chose NetGrocer . Unfortunately , this service handles only packaged goods , not fresh food , and it does n't list label information for some products . That can be a problem , says Cynthia Sass , RD , MPH , a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association ( ADA ) , because canned and boxed foods tend to be high in sodium and fat . ( Like NetGrocer , Peapod and Amazon list ingredients for many but not all products . ) Still , I was able to do some quick and easy menu planning : pasta and organic jarred tomato sauce ( which I would supplement with salad or other fresh vegetables ) , and soup and grilled cheese sandwiches ( ditto ) . The delivery fee was an obvious negative , but I put in the plus column the fact that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sample tastings , you can even save on calories . ) Probably because I was shopping from my desk instead of in a crowded store with a chattering child , I suddenly remembered a simple recipe for a corn tortilla and black bean casserole I had n't made in years . How convenient , I thought-until the delivery arrived without the beans ( " temporarily out of stock " ) . That reminded me : Peapod asks you when you place your order if substitutions are okay . MEAL PREP PLACES The service When I heard about My Girlfriend 's Kitchen , the very name gave me multilevel marketing jitters . I envisioned being dragged to a meal-assembly " party " and forced to sign up for a year 's worth of prepackaged food . Wrong . MGFK and similar companies , such as Let 's Do Dinner and Let 's Dish ! , consist of storefronts where you assemble prechopped and premixed ingredients in the pans or bags they provide . Then you take your stack of ready-to-cook meals home to store in the freezer . This trend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped up in the United States and Canada in recent years . How it worked On the MGFK Web site , I found a nutritionally detailed list of 14 meals and selected 6 . A few days later , my friend Monica and I took our daughters to the shop , where we found a dozen different food stations , each stocked with bins of ingredients-mostly frozen but appetizing , with brightly colored veggies ; good-looking chicken and fish ; and lean , red beef . We went from station to station , following posted instructions to scoop precise amounts into a foil pan or plastic bag : a scoop of ground turkey plus smaller scoops of grated carrots , celery , walnuts , and herbs for Little Meatloaf on the Prairie , for instance . It was fast , taking just over an hour , and easy ( really easy , because the girls ended up elbowing us aside ) . We arrived home with instructions on each package and a handy reference list detailing how to cook each meal we loaded into the freezer . You have to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I realized just before dinner that I had n't defrosted Inga 's Traditional Swedish Meatballs . That dish required sauting , but plenty go from the freezer straight into the slow cooker or oven . You also have to cook the pasta or rice that comes with many of the meals , and supplement the entres with side dishes or salad , if you 're so inclined . The food is family friendly ( read : accommodating to picky pint-size eaters ) and good-better than you get at many casual restaurants , especially because you can add or subtract ingredients according to your taste . Exotic it 's not , but we 've been back three times . " I call it halfway homemade , " says Sass . " The food is pretty much guaranteed to be tasty , but you do n't have to go buy a cookbook . On the flip side , some of the dishes can he high in fat and calories . " Detailed nutritional info on many of these services ' Web sites can help you avoid those pitfalls . Elisa Zied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetable content of many of the one-dish meals . " Eyeball the vegetable serving , " she suggests . " If it 's under half a cup , add to it with bagged baby carrots or low-sodium canned vegetables . " Because people get most of their veggies at dinner , she says , " it 's a good idea to get at least a cup per person . " DINNER FROM AISLE SIX The service The salad bar and ready-to-eat sections in supermarkets are growing like weeds : Profits grew 10% each year between 2000 and 2005 , industry analysts say . And the offerings are getting ever more elaborate : not just salad makings but soup , pizza , hot panini , and sushi-sometimes made to order . And , of course , the ubiquitous roasted chicken . How it worked On a busy night when Bill was out of town , Lily and I headed to our local market . I told her she could get whatever she wanted , as long as it was loosely based on the food pyramid . She chose three hard-boiled eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watermelon , and a roll ( not a traditional mix , but hey , she ate it all ) . I took small portions of various exotic salads , such as Asian chicken , quinoa , and black bean and corn . Salad bar items are sold by weight , so the dense eggs and heavy watermelon Lily chose really added up ; in fact , the meal was slightly more expensive than the one we got later in the week from the sushi bar . Another night , our budget dinner included roasted chicken and raw broccoli , which I cooked at home along with rice to round out the meal . Pricey or not , a salad bar can be a fast way to a healthy dinner . " You can usually find all kinds and colors of veggies , which means more nutrients and phytochemicals , " Sass says . " Buying 10 different vegetables to make a salad at home would get pretty expensive , and they 'd probably go bad before you used them up . " But keep an eye on the sodium-and calories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creamy dressings , and mayo-drenched mlanges are obvious disasters , but you do n't want to go overboard even on healthy options like chickpeas or raisins ; stick to about cup of the beans and no more than 2 tablespoons of dried fruit . What 's more , if you 're trying to lose weight , it 's a good idea to pick just one or two salads , Zied adds-save other tantalizing choices for your next visit . " Research shows that you eat less when there are n't too many tastes competing with each other , " she says . CHEF ON CALL The service This " someone else cooks it " category is stocked with gifted ( and not so gifted ) amateurs and professionals who have tired of interminable restaurant hours . These are n't personal chef services ; dishes are n't made to order . Instead , the companies offer daily or weekly menus of fresh-cooked meals delivered to your home , where you pile them into the fridge or freezer . How it worked Our local service , Personal Chef To Go , allowed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family-style containers of Zesty Whole Wheat Pasta Bake , Shrimp Scampi over Six-Grain Rice Pilaf , and Oven-Roasted Sliced Lean Filet of Beef , among other entres-and all of it tasted gourmet . Bonus : There were lots of interesting ingredients , such as roasted red peppers , pesto , and orzo . Zied was ready to place an order herself . But because companies like this vary widely , she recommends looking for one that posts nutrient analyses . " Otherwise , who knows how much butter the chef is throwing in ? " she asks . And even when the info is on the Web site , look for what is n't there-like sodium ( it was n't listed on our nutritional information ) . " Just call up and talk to the chef , " she advises . DIET FOOD BY MAIL The service Plenty of online companies ship fresh meals , most of them to people who want to lose weight . Typically , these outfits are n't simply dinner providers ; they send you food for the whole day . Some give you a choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less pricey . How it worked My idea of heaven is to pop a plate of something nutritious and delicious into the microwave and sit down to dinner 3 minutes later . So I was charmed when I heard about eDiets Express , which promised to let me choose a week 's worth of breakfasts , lunches , dinners , and snacks for delivery . But when I ordered , a message popped up : The first week of meals was preselected , no changes allowed . We received stuffed peppers with a side of vegetables , boneless baked chicken with beets , and turkey meat loaf with chickpea salad , among other dishes . We also got muffins . A lot of muffins . In fact , that was all we got for breakfast 2 out of the 7 days we used the service . Zied was not impressed . " What 's with the muffins ? A blueberry muffin is not a meal . Breakfast is your best opportunity to get four key elements : whole grains , fiber , dairy , and fruit . This skimps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks just as bad . " I loved the convenience , but that was about all eDiets had going for it . The stuffed peppers tasted okay , but the chicken breast was flavorless and rubbery , and we had to douse the turkey meat loaf in ketchup . Plus , the portions were too small . The meal plan will work for weight loss and maintenance , according to eDiets , but the maximum calories offered are a mere 1,400 per day . That 's not enough for a 220-pound man ; even a reasonably active woman of my height ( 5-foot-6 ) should be getting about 1,800 calories , Zied says . By the second day , Bill and I were starving . The eDiets dietitian told us that we should each add 800 to 1,000 calories per day in snacks-which we had to provide . " This is n't really helpful for a dieter , " Zied says . " You could pick junk food for those 800 calories-you would n't get the nutrients you need , and you 'd probably still end up hungry .
