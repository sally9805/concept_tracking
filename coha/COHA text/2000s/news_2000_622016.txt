<p> GOT A lucky man 's view of the ballpark the other night . Right down in the first row , alongside the Giants ' dugout , where the owners sit . The views were Louvre-like in their magnificence . Barry Bonds , waiting on deck , could n't have been more than 10 feet away . A freaky foul ball whistled over our heads , and there was nervous laughter all around . The idea was to spend a couple of innings with Peter Magowan and Larry Baer on the matter of Pac Bell perfection  --  and imperfection . With the help of their enlightenment , here are a few things to keep in mind : <p> There will be no protective measures for fans most exposed to danger  --  and thank heaven for that . The whole idea of this ballpark is intimacy , and although the Giants have taken the idea to extremes , they hardly are setting a precedent . Pac Bell is no different from countless old-time parks  --  and just about every facility you see in spring training  --  when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field level are Candlestick people , " said Baer , " fans who bought their tickets four years ago because they wanted that exact location . They know what they 're getting themselves into . " . . . Listen , nobody is discounting the possibility of disaster . But no self-respecting fan would tolerate a screen blocking his precious ( and costly ) view . And how high would you build it ? Enough to protect six rows , but not the seventh ? . . . " Rusty , " the lamentable gyrating man , is by no means permanent  --  not if the Giants sense a lingering hostility and it becomes an embarrassment to its sponsor , Old Navy . . . First order of business with Rusty : Do n't let anyone know he 's coming . The P.A. announcement causes a wave of anticipation  --  for damn little , as it turns out . . . Out in left field , the Chevron headlights have been dimmed  --  an improvement , but not likely to satisfy offended fans and left fielders . . . Chevron just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights and , as 3-Dot regular Cranky Eric suggests , " Make that car a convertible . " That way it wo n't block so many seats ( currently rendered useless ) behind the left-field wall . " Chevron wanted something distinctive , " said Baer . " Maybe it 's too much . " . . . You have to laugh when people complain about congestion in the walkways . It 's a mess up there but a delightful one , if you have any memories of the desolate Candlestick . Like a new ride at Disneyland , the corridors are jammed right now , but they 'll settle down eventually . . . One man 's opinion after long waits at a dozen concession stands : The employees are remarkably nice and accommodating . But they offer no sense of urgency , preparation or teamwork . They just float along happily , at their own pace , while the lines grow longer . Of course , you would n't have to stand in line at all if a vendor showed up in the stands occasionally . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-field fence . Last night , fans were able to hang around as long as they liked . . . The out-of-town scoreboards look cool , but they are inexcusably useless to a huge number of fans  --  even those with choice seats along the first-base line . At least they have been simplified ( for those in position to read them ) , showing only the inning and score ; the pitchers ' numbers were eliminated . . . Baer said it 's conceivable that out-of-town scores could be posted on the small electric boards currently showing " pitch speed " ( nobody cares , and if they do , they do n't trust the numbers ) . . . The residue of advertising , part 18 : That Waterhouse-sponsored board showing stock quotes . Hey , nothing like the Intel Corp stats to really get those ball juices flowing . That also could be used for more relevant purposes , in time . . . Best suggestion of all for out-of-town results : Give the games full treatment on the big board . Show the linescore with home runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dodger Stadium . . . Speaking of the big board , even with the heavy constraints of advertising , the Giants have the one thing that is absolutely necessary : The full lineup , with numbers and positions , of the team at bat . The rest of it is painfully ordinary . Back in the early ' 80s , when we pounded the A 's beat , writers used to scoff at the old County Stadium board in Milwaukee with its sepia-toned features and hopelessly dated cartoon characters . Well , the Giants have exactly that  --  at least for the moment . Baer said some technical improvements are in store . . . The smaller boards need work in every way , from their informational value to their appearance . " Chintzy fonts , " said one observer ( and if there 's anything I hate , it 's a chintzy font ) . . . Let 's hope the players shed their indifference over the new uniforms , because they are glorious  --  distinctive and traditionally simple at the same time . Fans never demand the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who the players are , and the notion promotes a selfless team concept . . . There are scorecards , complete with rosters and some hints on how to score , inside the 50-cent newspapers on sale at the park . Nice thought . An even better touch would be selling individual scorecards , on solid ( cardboard ) paper , including that day 's lineup . It would be kind of a last-minute deal , since the lineups generally do n't become official until about 90 minutes before game time , but highly worthwhile  --  a great way to keep fans ' heads in the game . Sell ' em for a dollar , through vendors in the stands , right up to the first pitch . . . A small thing , yet immensely large : The good brown mustard ( Gulden 's ) is becoming available on all levels , not just the Club . . . Memo to that select group of drunken morons in the bleachers : If somebody wants to keep a visiting player 's home run  --  to give to his little kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give him some good-natured ribbing , but none of the idiocy that occurred on Opening Day , when a 45-year-old real estate broker caught Kevin Elster 's historic first homer and was physically assaulted when he would n't throw it back . . . The Giants are experimenting with a number of starting times to get a feel for the fans ' response , but no game should start later than 7 p.m . This is a whole new world for leaving the yard  --  by ferry , BART , Muni , train , cab , whatever , and time is of the essence . . . What happened to the retired numbers , once so prominently displayed on the Candlestick outfield walls ? They exist , but in virtual obscurity on top of the Giants ' dugout . Look for them to be displayed on a flagpole or inscribed in open areas on the outfield brick . . . This has been a wild , rainy week of south winds , offering absolutely no instructional value for those looking ahead to summer . Barry Bonds had his long drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , that ball goes way foul . . . Most of the television angles look good , but the most prominent one , from center field , is somewhat disappointing with the rotating ads and a behind-the-plate area that seems to serve no purpose beyond seating for security guards . Oh , for a five-foot wall of red brick . . . From the blimps and helicopters , the park is flat-out the most beautiful ever seen in the big leagues . You just ca n't beat the combination of shimmering water , the San Francisco skyline and a gorgeous grass field  --  solid green , thanks to the only groundskeepers smart enough to leave it alone . . . And finally , a sweet rarity for anyone on the third-base side of the park : When towering drives head for the bay down the right-field line , they travel into blackness . There 's nothing out there  --  no buildings , no lights . There goes the baseball , heading straight into the night . <p> Bruce Jenkins can be reached via e-mail at jenks@sfgate.com.
