<p> Baseball fanatics , souvenir hunters and those who simply want to witness history will roll into San Francisco next week for the spectacle that is Barry Bonds ' assault on the all-time home run record . <p> The Giants slugger is only two homers away from tying Hank Aaron 's career mark of 755 , perhaps the most revered record in sports . He could break the record during a seven-game homestand starting Monday against the Atlanta Braves , Aaron 's former team , and the jockeying for position to catch the home run ball at AT &T; Park has already begun . <p> The games next week against Atlanta and the Florida Marlins are within a few hundred seats of being sold out , leaving fans with a hankering for history little choice but to wade into the online resale market . <p> " This is the hottest ticket sales have been since the All-Star Game , " said Jennifer Swanson , spokeswoman for TicketsNow , which resells tickets to the public from licensed brokers . " It 's reaching a fever pitch . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a common location for Bonds homers to land  --  usually go for between $29 and $33 , but they were being peddled online Friday for as much as $500 . <p> The Giants still have standing-room-only seats available for some games for $10 , team spokeswoman Staci Slaughter said , but those too are expected to turn into gold as soon as the Giants head home from their series this weekend in Milwaukee . <p> Tickets for games next week are selling for an average of about $80 at the various online sites , including the Giants ' own Double Play Ticket Window , which allows season ticket holders to squeeze the ticketless masses for all they are worth . <p> Home run fever officially started Thursday when Bonds whacked two dingers into the ferocious winds at Wrigley Field during the Giants ' 9-8 loss to the Chicago Cubs . <p> The blasts were his first in 16 days , and they awakened the slumbering national media . <p> " We definitely noticed an uptick in ticket sales after he hit the home runs , " Slaughter said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he hit the two home runs , and my phone has been ringing off the hook . " <p> Sean Pate , spokesman for StubHub , which charges a 10 percent fee to buy and a 15 percent fee to sell tickets on its Web site , said prime seats for next week 's games are selling for upward of $300 . He figures that 's just the beginning . <p> " It 's going to be very crazy , " he said . " People are going to want to be there for the tying or record-breaking home run . When he 's on 754 , each game is going to be a premium game . " <p> The Giants , San Francisco police and the Coast Guard are preparing for the craziness by beefing up security in and around AT &T; Park . <p> The Giants normally sell several hundred standing-room-only tickets for big games , and many of those ticket-holders congregate in the arcade section . That 's going to be harder to do this homestand , Slaughter said . <p> " We will be checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a limited number of standing-room tickets , " Slaughter said . <p> All the baseballs pitched to Bonds now are stamped with a special logo for authentication . The fan who emerges from the inevitable scramble for the record-setting ball will be hustled away by security guards , Slaughter said . <p> " We want to make sure they are in a safe spot , " she said . " If they want to watch the rest of the game , we will put the ball in a safe for them . It 's really up to the person who catches the ball to determine what he wants to do with it . We usually meet with them and try to figure out if there is anything they would be interested in to trade for the ball , but this is going to be a pretty valuable ball . " <p> Outside the park , people will be able to watch the game through the right field knothole fence for three innings at a time , the usual limit at big games . <p> The Coast Guard will keep an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other watercraft expected to congregate in McCovey Cove in case the record-breaking tater is a " Splash Hit . " Bonds has hit 34 of those in his career . <p> There is no plan to have boaters preregister or to limit their numbers , as was done during the All-Star Game , said Lt. Anya Hunter , the spokeswoman for Coast Guard San Francisco . <p> Hunter said the Coast Guard 's primary concern is the barge outside AT &T; Park loaded with fireworks for the moment when Bonds hits No. 756 . She said boats will be kept 1,000 feet from the barge . <p> " The problem with this event is we do n't know when it is going to happen , " Hunter said . " All of our crews out there are on alert , and everyone knows that this is pending , but they ca n't sit out and wait for days at a time . As soon we know that the fireworks show is going off or if there is a safety concern because of a large number of boats , then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a spectacular conundrum for a nation in which many people view Bonds as a cheater whose home run power is tainted by the use of performance-enhancing drugs , something the Giants slugger has denied doing knowingly . <p> Aaron is n't planning to show up for any of the games or , it seems , even acknowledge the record . But it still amounts to big business in the city by the bay . <p> " Just like the stock market , these games are hot , so people are going to start asking higher prices , " Pate said . " It is going to be pretty busy around here for the next week or 10 days .
