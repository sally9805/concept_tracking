I spend more time now looking back than looking ahead , sifting through the years and pausing over the important events of my life . Maybe it 's rare , but aside from the occasional sadness that accompanies us all , there is no litany of disappointments for me . Instead , there is a storehouse of good memories and special times . We all have some defining moments in our lives . Mine was a holiday that seemed perfect . <br> Of my five children , three boys and one daughter are grown and employed , but none is far away from this old farm we 've called home for four generations . They come back for the holidays and sometimes for dinners , unsolicited advice , to borrow tools , or to just sit quietly on the porch with their feet propped up on the rail , listening to farm sounds , which lift our spirits even in the worst of times . They grew up here on land my great-great-grandfather purchased from the Blackfoot Indians . Just south of our house , a large stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hidden the remnants of their settler 's cabin . Our memories on this farm are good . <br> Mary Ann , my wife , teaches English and debate at the Crossing Trails High School , from which each of the four generations of the McCray family have graduated . The more recent generations were spoiled by a school bus . The older two rode horses nearly eight miles each way and were not shy about recounting the details of their burdensome journey . <br> Then , there is Todd , my youngest child . By that Christmas he was old enough in years to be on his own , to have a real job like his siblings , but the immaturity that naturally accompanied his disability kept him home with his mother and me . <br> Todd looked like any other healthy twenty-year-old , but he had his own way of thinking about things . You 'd know from watching or even talking with him briefly that something was unusual . Over the years , we tolerated some stares and whispers , but learned to think nothing of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born to us later in life , a good ten years after we thought we were finished with diapers . Mary Ann , my wife of nearly forty years , frets over Todd and connects his problems with her late-life pregnancy . <br> I 've learned that for every deficit one might see in Todd , there is an ability you do n't see . <br> Todd always had his hands in his pockets and never seemed certain which direction he was going when he went out the door . His clothes seldom added up to an outfit and his hair , the color of sun-bleached rope , was punctuated with cowlicks and curls . Sometimes he would sit near a herd of sheep for an entire day , just watching . Other days , he would find a river and follow it upstream , searching for the place where the water began . He never found this place , but that did not deter him from trying . <br> Todd also loved to paint . If I stood him in front of a building , he would paint it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that our son would forget he was on a ladder and fall straight off and hurt himself . He was under strict orders to climb no higher than the third rung , which left many painting projects half finished . <br> To add to this peculiar feature , our neighbors seemed to enjoy giving Todd their leftover paint . However kind this may have been , it did not result in a harmonious color scheme . Our farm was painted with colors rejected by others , often for good reasons . Once again , we grew accustomed to the staring , and no one laughed harder at it than we did . We always thought of it as primer over which we would someday paint , but , like most eyesores , in time we stopped noticing . We took great pride in telling passers-by that we were the Midwest testing site for the Todd Paint Company . <br> Unless it was something he felt passionate about , Todd usually was n't much of a talker , but he whistled from memory , and off-key , every tune that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . I continually pleaded with him to take off the earphones so I could talk to him . He gladly complied , but rarely would he take them off unless he was asked first . <br> The one thing that defined Todd 's life more than any other was his relationship with animals . He held them , raised them , loved them , and laughed with them . I am outdoors caring for animals all day . When finished , I want to leave the work behind , so I try to keep animals out of my house , but if one could be carted , crated , boxed , or stalled , Todd tried to bring it into the barn or garage and , more times than not , sneak it up to his room . This worked well enough for squirrels , rabbits , and baby birds , but not so well for skunks , snakes , and toads . To make matters worse , Todd 's room was always a mess , which served as an excellent camouflage for a variety of uninvited guests . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to set wild animals free . Not to do so was cruel . The only exception was for creatures that were injured or otherwise unable to care for themselves . As a result , every hurt , maimed , and lost animal within five counties somehow made its way directly to our back porch . <br> There was no money for veterinarians , so Todd became a bit of an animal medicine man . He was not at all shy about using the phone to ask for help . In fact , I often had to work hard to keep him off it . <br> He was very patient and determined in his rescue missions . And it was rare for anyone to turn Todd down because they were too busy . It was n't that they felt sorry for him . He was one of those people who could capture you with his enthusiasm , and before you knew it his urgent need became your urgent need . <br> He would set out calling Jim Morton , our vet , who in turn would give Todd the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service , depending on whether Todd 's latest patient walked , climbed , flew , or slithered . One could amble into the room and find Todd talking to a professor of ornithology at the local university about a broken bird wing . Before long , it seemed like the entire American university system had abandoned world hunger and quantum physics . After all , there was the problem of Todd 's bird that needed immediate attention . <br> Todd had a way of setting things in motion , and when he did , we dropped everything . I must admit , however , that I did not see this one coming . <br> One early December afternoon , Todd came running into the barn carrying his radio and frantically trying to scribble down a phone number . He handed me the wrinkled note . <br> " It 's for a Christmas dog , " he said . <br> " Slow down , Todd . What are you talking about ? " <br> " The animal shelter wants you to adopt a dog for the Christmas holiday . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what they do . Besides , we do n't need another animal around here , and most definitely not a dog . " We had been a dogless farm for many years , and I was not ready to change that arrangement . I had my own reasons for not wanting a dog -- long-standing ones . It ended poorly with the last several dogs I let into my life and I was dead set against trying it again . I 'd spent twenty years saying no to Todd 's brothers and his sister and I saw no reason to change my mind now . <br> " It 's just for Christmas , " he said in what came as close to an argumentative tone as Todd could muster . " After that , you can take the dog back if you want . They have lots of dogs that do n't have homes . " <br> I pushed the scrap of paper into the front pocket of my jeans and hoped he would forget about it . But Todd continued with his innocent persistence that wore on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he pleaded as I tried to walk away . <br> " Todd , there is no use in calling . We 've had this discussion before . We are not having a dog on this farm . We already have plenty of animals to care for . We do n't need more . We 've got work to do now . " He was still looking disappointed . I wanted to give him time to adjust to a situation that he might have a hard time accepting . " Let 's get some chores done and maybe we can talk about it later . " <br> " It 'll be too late by then . It will be closed and all the dogs will be gone . " His voice quivered . He kicked at the earth with his large feet and hung his head . I knew he was only moments away from tears . Saying no to Todd was never easy . <br> I took the red handkerchief that I kept in my front overalls pocket and wiped the sweat from my brow . Just like the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept that he could not always have what he wanted . It would take time to walk him through this one . I playfully grabbed him in a headlock and rubbed my knuckles across the crown of his head until he started to laugh , then I released my hold and held him by the lapels of his jacket and said , " Come on , Todd , let 's go finish the chores and then we 'll talk about it more tonight . Those dogs are n't going anywhere , and if they did , that would be a good thing for them . " <br> We had a ritual of chores that started with the chickens , passed a hog or two , and ended up at a corral where I kept cows and their calves . We , of course , fed and watered the stock , but beyond that , without ever thinking about it , we made sure each animal was healthy . You ca n't take a chicken 's temperature and cattle do n't sneeze when they 're sick . You have to sense something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't move . <br> Todd slipped between the rails of the corral and walked freely among the cows , touching and assessing each animal that he passed . Cattle and sheep are less domesticated than horses and do n't generally like to be handled or touched , which made Todd 's ability unusual . I watched him as he made his rounds and called out updates . <br> " The twins look good . " <br> " Yeah , they do , " I answered back . <br> " Old Two Stubs looks thin . Do you think we should worm her again ? " <br> " Probably , " I concurred , readying a mixture of corn and sorghum to pour into a long cylindrically-shaped aluminum trough . The calves bawled as the larger cows jostled for a front-row seat . There are no manners in the feedlot . The biggest always win . <br> Todd stopped in his tracks as if he remembered something important . Surrounded by hungry , jostling animals but without the least bit of fear , he worked his way out of the corral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches from my face and just stared at me . I had no idea what was on his mind . <br> " What ? " I finally asked . <br> " The cows are fine , Dad . " <br> " So ? " <br> " Could I call -- now ? " <br> " Todd Arthur McCray , enough about the dogs . Okay ? " <br> He frowned and walked toward the house . Todd was such a good kid , but I needed more time to think about this one . If I decided against it , Todd was going to find it difficult to accept , but I knew I should not let disappointing Todd get in the way of making the right decision . <br> Truth was that I missed having a dog , but there were a lot of reasons to move slowly on this one . Certainly , it would make Todd and his mother happy . In fact , I knew darn well that if I let Todd or his mother so much as look at a dog , it would own the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place at the dinner table . I could picture the chaos that would ensue . <br> " Where 's your father , Todd ? I do n't believe I 've seen him for two or three years now . " <br> " What do you mean , Mom ? Dad is still here . He 's been out on the back porch for the last couple of winters . You know , where you put him after we got the dog . " <br> " Oh , yes , I remember now . " <br> " Todd , get the dog and come to dinner , we 're having prime rib . You know how Fido just loves prime rib . If there is any left over , put it out on the back porch for your dad and do tell him hello for me the next time you see him . " <br> When it was time for dinner , or what my grandfather called supper , I walked past the porch on the south side of our home and into the mudroom at the back of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy boots and overalls . I could hear Todd and Mary Ann talking at the kitchen table . He had started dog campaigning with his mother . As I expected , it took very little convincing . To her credit , she waited at least ten or fifteen seconds before she sold me down the river . <br> " Yes , Todd , I can see why you want the dog , and no , I do n't understand why he would not want you to have one . Like you said , it 's just for a week and then you can take the dog back if it does n't work out for you . I heard the whole thing on the radio and it seems like such a nice thing to do for those poor dogs . " <br> " I would take good care of him , Mom . " <br> " Of course you would , Todd . Your dad knows that too . We 'll just have to work on him , wo n't we ? " <br> " Is there some reason I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " None . None at all , " she said . <br> The discussion I wanted to have with Todd had just occurred in my absence . Our home is not a democracy . It is a benevolent dictatorship . Queen Mary Ann had spoken . <br> From the mudroom bench I stood up and walked into the kitchen , took off my leather gloves , set them on the kitchen counter , and jumped into the conversation . " I know there are lots of reasons to give this dog program a try , but I still am not sure that it 's a good idea . " <br> Todd was not too worried about my concerns . " The radio said it was a good idea . " <br> " Yes , I 'm sure the radio thinks it 's a good idea , but still I want to check into it myself . Can you two wait for me to do that ? " I asked . <br> " Yes , " Todd said with no conviction . <br> I smiled at him and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait . " <br> " Big rush ? " <br> He knew I was teasing him and he smiled back and said , " Ca n't wait . " <br> " They 're closed tonight . Do you think we should call the emergency number to check on this program or could you and your mother hold off until morning to discuss this further ? " <br> He paused and it was clear that he was seriously considering calling the emergency number . " Todd ! " I said . <br> He pondered his options and finally said , " I guess I can wait . " <br> Continues ...
