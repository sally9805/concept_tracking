Prologue At night , when the tunnels of B'hala were empty , dust swept through on tireless winds . The night breezes were relentless in their irregular keening , the soft , lonely sounds trailing over heaps of dry and crumbling soil , lingering in the corners and dark spaces of the long lost city . Like the gentle cries of shades and spirits lamenting the daily disturbances of their tomb . Sometimes , particularly at night when he could n't sleep , Jacob Isaac Sisko thought he might like to write about those ancient spirits  --  a short piece of fiction , or even a poem  --  but those instances were few and far between . For the first time in years he had put aside his writing padd , and for the time being , at least , he did n't miss it much . Besides , by the end of each day , he was usually too exhausted to do more than eat , pull off his boots , and crawl into his cot , the sheets heavy with dust in spite of the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he dreamed , he did n't remember upon waking . Last night , though ... He was n't quite ready to think about that ; he concentrated instead on the small patch of dry and faded earth beneath his fingers , on the feel of the brush in his hand as he carefully dusted . Behind him , Prylar Eivos droned on about some of the recent discoveries in the southernmost section of the dig , his ponderous voice seeming to draw the very life out of the tunnel 's cool , recycled air . Eivos was a nice enough man , but probably the most dreadfully dry of all the student overseers ; the aging monk seemed to be perfectly happy with the sound of his own voice , regardless of whether or not the content was relevant to anything . Jake tuned in for a moment , still brushing at what would almost certainly turn out to be yet another pottery shard. " ... but there was one figurine among the rest that was carved out of jevonite , which is nothing short of extraordinary , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thought to the matter . " As you know , it has always been believed that jevonite could be found only on Cardassia ... " Jake tuned out again , paying just enough attention to know when to nod respectfully . From farther down the tunnel he could hear the soft hum of the solids detectors and the repetitive chunk of manually worked picks and shovels . They were pleasant sounds , a bright counterpart to the nights of ghostly crying from ancestors not his own .... He was feeling a bit on the poetic side lately , was n't he ? It was strange , unearthing fragments from an ancient culture , and stranger still that the culture was n't even his  - -   - -   Dad 's , though , in a way , and in the dream  - -  He shut that thought down before it could get any further , afraid of the concomitant feelings , afraid of what he might uncover . And he realized that , beneath the soft bristles of his brush , a sliver of color had appeared , a dull red against the lighter soil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ... but then , quantum-dating of the jevonite artifacts unearthed at the site proves indisputably that they actually predate the First Hibetian civilization , " the monk stated firmly , and took a deep breath . " I think I 've found it , " Jake said quickly . The prylar smiled , stepping forward and crouching , using the tunnel wall as a support . He pulled his own brush from a fold in his robes and whisked the remaining soil from around the piece with practiced ease . As Jake suspected , it was another broken clay shard . For every intact relic that was uncovered at B'hala , there seemed to be about a billion broken ones . And they all have to be catalogued . " Let 's see what we have here ... ah , very good , Jake ! " The prylar stepped back , reaching for one of the innumerable trays on the nearby cart . " And how gratifying  --  it 's kejelious , one of the most important materials used during the Sh'dama Age . Have I ever told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciates how versatile it can be , when the liquid ratios are altered ... " Jake nodded , smiling , seeing no point in reminding the monk that he 'd already heard all about the virtues of the stuff , twice . Eivos really was a nice old guy , and seemed to be genuinely excited about the work  --  though for the first time in all his weeks at B'hala Jake found himself feeling disappointed , gazing at the slender fragment as the monk eased it from the ground . Maybe because it 's not what you came here to find , his mind whispered , and it was another thought that he pushed away  --  but not so quickly as he might have only a few days before . Things were changing whether he liked it or not , and though he knew it was inevitable , had known for some weeks , a part of him was still fighting to avoid the next step . Acceptance . When the prylar suggested that they break for a meal , Jake was relieved . He hurried away , suddenly eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and wind , where his father was a ghost that could only be longed for . It was late in the afternoon before he thought of it again . The dream , Jake . Last night . He felt a tingle at the back of his neck , a subtle shiver of remembered dream-reality  --  something about the wormhole ... ? Jake sighed , still not sure he wanted to remember . Not sure he was ready , in spite of the fact that he 'd been having trouble concentrating for the last several days , really . He was alone in one of the smaller catalog rooms , a constant , soft drone of activity filtering in through several openings that had once been windows ; he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes , breathing deeply . As far down as they were , second level up from the tunnels , it was always pleasantly cool , and although a lot of the volunteers preferred to work in the larger , climate-controlled areas , he liked the fresh air . Usually it kept him alert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since breakfast , technically , although working with Prylar Eivos would make an android 's mind wander .... Jake opened his eyes and returned his attention to the shard he 'd been handling , one of several from the area he thought of as the Kitchens , over at the northeast end of the partially unearthed city . Number , 1601 ; Designation , C/Utensil . The familiar numbers and keys of the database portable flew ; he hardly had to look at the container tag , knowing from the curve and distinctive blue color that it was another one of the goblet sets . He 'd catalogued at least thirty of them in the last few days , all from the same coordinates . Standard estimation comments from Prylar Krish , noted date of extraction ... ... and had he been in the wormhole with his father ? It seemed so distant , but he thought that the dream had been about him and Dad , together , flying ... Jake set the piece of clay aside , knowing that he had to stop dancing away from the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his time at B'hala had been about , and toward why he had come . To accept the fact that I have to go on without him . The hesitant thought , so simply worded on the page in his mind 's eye , struck him as a little trite  --  but no less true or powerful for that . When no paralyzing sorrow came , he allowed the thought again , accepting the heaviness in his throat and chest . For now , at least , he had to make a life for himself . It hurt , but there was also a forced quality to it . Or , not forced , but ... deliberate . He knew what had to happen , what he was supposed to do , but he did n't feel it yet . But Dax said that 's normal , did n't she ? That it could be a gradual thing , or all at once . Ezri had been very straightforward about what he might experience , telling him not to underestimate or belittle his loss , and to keep his expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times , before and after leaving the station , carefully skirting any real conversation about his father . When he 'd told her about his intention to join the B'hala excavation , she 'd suggested that not thinking for a while might be exactly what he needed ; in the almost nine weeks since he 'd started , Jake had come to agree wholeheartedly . He 'd been invited just about everywhere on Bajor after his father 's disappearance . Like Kas , Jake had politely turned down each hopeful request  --  to speak at schools , to lead prayer groups , to extend blessings over everything from local harvest festivals to the openings of new business ventures . Kasidy had received twice as many offers ; he was the Emissary 's son , but Kasidy was carrying the Emissary 's unborn child , a somehow more miraculous connection . They 'd shared a quiet laugh about it the last time they 'd talked , some small joke that was more affectionate than funny . Jake loved her for that , and had been glad to see how well she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if her eyes were a little sad . You 're still dancing , Jake , avoiding the inevitable  - -  Jake scowled at his inner voice . If it was inevitable , why rush ? It was n't like he was on a schedule . Although he had n't realized it at the time , getting away from the station had been the best thing he could 've done . The initial invitation to visit B'hala had been extended by a branch of the Order of the Temple , the prylars who primarily worked the dig , and had been offered as a chance to experience Bajoran history firsthand . Being the Emissary 's son surely had plenty to do with it , but Jake appreciated the less-obvious wording . He knew that B'hala had been a special place for his father . And the fact of it was , the station had been too empty without Dad , and the looks of sympathy  --  or worse , the well-meant platitudes from the Bajoran segment , about the Emissary 's great calling  --  had only served to remind Jake of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , and his friends , especially Ezri and Nog , but B'hala had been what he needed . He 'd heard about the volunteer program  --  usually open only to religious initiates  --  on the second night of what had started as a four-day visit , and had only been back to the station once , to pick up a few personal items . He 'd had time here . Time to not think , to categorize shards and books , to run artifacts between scholars and techs and prylars and vedeks . In the mornings , there were the digs , while afternoons were usually for cataloguing . Occasionally he helped out the students who hand-cleaned and preserved the crumbling stones from the many small temples that dotted the city , each etched with secrets from thousands of years past . For all the sense of community , there were enough people milling around for Jake to feel anonymous  --  well , more so than on the station , anyway . Besides the initiate program , there was also a large , semi-organized group of research scientists on site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of recently arrived Vulcan chronologists and a few assorted off-world theology groups  --  not to mention a constant trickle of the faithful , devout sightseers who came to pray and meditate in the long shadow of B'hala 's central bantaca . Jake generally avoided the spire during the daylight hours , as uncomfortable as ever with being recognized  --  " Jake Sisko ? " Jake blinked , then smiled amiably at the small Bajoran woman in the doorway . Speak of the devil , as his grandfather liked to say . He still felt uneasy with the semi-reverent attitude that so often accompanied his name  --  when spoken by a Bajoran  --  but it was actually a relief to have his meandering self-analysis interrupted . The stranger wore a prylar 's robes , and was very obviously a member of the dig ; short , silver hair contrasted sharply with her deeply tanned skin , and she had the look of leathery strength that he 'd come to associate with the lifelong archeologists who had come to work at B'hala . She did n't look familiar , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? " The monk stepped inside , and in the few seconds it took her to cross the room , Jake decided that she was nervous about something . She walked stiffly , her expression polite but blank , her hands clutching at the shoulder strap of a well-worn satchel . She stopped in front of him and seemed to study his features , her pale eyes intent with some emotion he could n't place . Jake waited for her to speak , interested ; a break in routine , with a vague air of mystery .... Give it up . She probably wants directions , or an entry reading . The prylar smiled , revealing small white teeth and deeply etched laugh lines . " My name is Istani Reyla . I 'm  --  I was one of the main overseers with Site Extension . " Jake nodded . Beneath the seemingly casual working atmosphere at B'hala was a well-organized system of committees and unions ; Site Extension made the decisions about where to dig next and sent in the first documentation people , mostly scientists or vedeks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard they 'd recently excavated the oldest shrine yet discovered , in the ruins beneath B'hala . " Nice to meet you . What can I help you with ? " The prylar reached into her bag and pulled out a narrow , loosely wrapped bundle , vaguely tube-shaped . The careful way she handed it to him suggested that it was exceptionally valuable or fragile . The package was very light , the cloth it was wrapped in organic and extremely soft . " It 's a ... document of sorts . Very old . If  --  it may be  --  I believe it 's important that you  --  " She grinned suddenly , and shook her head . " I 'm sorry , it 's been a long week . " Her voice was low and musical , and Jake noticed how tired she seemed . There were dark circles under her eyes . So much for intrigue . He smiled , setting the bundle on the counter in front of him . She seemed nice , if a little odd ; scientists . " I understand . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray of jewelry ahead of you , but I can run it through the translator after that . There 's kind of a backlog for the main computer , but if you do n't mind a simple text , I should have it done by  --  " Prylar Istani shook her head , her grin fading . " No , it 's for you . It was written for you , for the son of the Emissary . I believe that unequivocally . Please , do n't share it with anyone until you 've read it . Whatever you decide to do after that ... " She took a deep breath , meeting his gaze squarely . Her own was bright and sincere . " Read it , and think about it . Trust your heart . You 'll know what to do . " Without another word , she turned and walked out . Jake started to stand , then sat down again . That was interesting . After nine weeks of quiet and routine , he was n't sure what to do ... besides the obvious . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart beating faster at the sight of the tattered parchment inside . " Very old " was an understatement , though Istani surely knew that . Jake had n't become an expert by any means , but from his weeks of cataloguing , he 'd seen enough to make a layman 's evaluation . By the uneven texture of the single page and the light shade of ink , it was the oldest document he 'd yet handled . And he 'd dated writings 23 millennia old . He looked back at the suddenly boring sprawl of pottery bits he was supposed to finish and decided he could n't wait . There was a text translation program back at his field shelter , the very one that Jadzia had augmented during that crazy " Reckoning " business over a year ago ; new symbols were being added all of the time . He was ahead of schedule , anyway , and it was n't as though anyone was waiting urgently for his next filing . He marked where he 'd left off with a tag and quickly straightened the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was looking forward to telling Dad about it . To seeing his eyes light up with interest , and the slight smile he 'd wear as he listened to Jake recount the facts . Jake took a deep breath , releasing the sorrow and anger as best he could , deciding that he 'd worked on his acceptance of truth enough for one day . He had a mystery to unravel  --  and though he would not have admitted it out loud , he could not help the small but desperate hope that somehow , in some way , whatever he uncovered might tell his heart something about why his father had had to go . ... battles fall and fail , and there is a time of waiting , the space between breaths as the land heals and its children retire from war . The Temple welcomes many home , the faithful and the Chosen . A Herald , unforgotten but lost to time , a Seer of Visions to whom the Teacher Prophets sing , will return from the Temple at the end of this time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The welcomed Herald shares a new understanding of the Temple with all the land 's children . Conceived by lights of war , the alien Avatar opens its eyes upon a waxing tide of Awareness . The journey to the land hides , but is difficult ; prophecies are revealed and hidden . The first child , a son , enters the Temple alone . With the Herald , he returns , and soon after , the Avatar is born . A new breath is drawn and the land rejoices in change and clarity . Jake rubbed his eyes , wincing at the hot and grainy feel of them , too excited to care much . It was late , hours after he normally went to bed , but he could n't sleep . He sat at the ancient chipped desk in his small field shelter , the translation and the original in front of him , writing and rewriting the text 's story in his mind . He 'd lost count of how many times he 'd read it , but if it was true ... if he decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not believe it ? How can I deny what 's in front of me ? He 'd already verified an approximate age , making it a credible artifact . To get an exact date , he 'd need access to equipment in B'hala 's lab complex ; they had a sensor there for detecting the degradation of cytoplasmic proteins in plant cells , used specifically for pounded root parchment . It was amazing , how well-preserved most of the ancient Bajoran writings were , the materials treated by some method long lost to Bajor of the present ; even the oldest books seemed to have held up better than many stone carvings from only a few centuries ago . The remnant in front of him was way beyond " old . " His tricorder had only been able to run a basic biospectral analysis , but that still put it as written between 30 and 32 millennia ago  --  putting it in the era of the tablet that had correctly foretold the Reckoning . And what it says ... the son goes into the Temple and comes back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and in time to witness the spiritually significant birth of an alien child . The translator 's dictionary said that avatar meant " embodiment of revelation " in the document 's context . The word for herald , " elipagh , " could also be translated as messenger or proxy , as carrier or bearer of news  --  and as emissary . The son , him . The elipagh , Benjamin Sisko . The Avatar  --  Kas and Dad 's baby , conceived in wartime , due in ... five months , give or take . He 'd have to get a ship , go into the wormhole by himself ... " ' Prophecies are revealed and hidden , ' " he said softly , and rubbed his eyes again . Was that meant for him ? Did it mean that a revealed prophecy would be hidden , or that there were things that would n't be revealed ? Maybe it was n't a prophecy at all ; a lot of the ancient writings contradicted one another , or foretold things that had never happened . But ... it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't share the Bajoran faith  --  but he 'd seen and experienced enough not to doubt that the Prophets , whatever they really were , had an interest in the destiny of Bajor , and he knew from his father 's encounters with the wormhole beings that feelings counted for a lot . It felt true , and he could n't shake the distinct feeling that he was meant to see it . Jake shook his head , not sure where to put such an overwhelming thought  --  that millennia ago , someone had foreseen him . And written about it . He 'd already tried to track down the prylar , but she was gone , or hiding . He wanted to know more , to ask her so many things . According to Site Extension , Prylar Istani Reyla had signed herself out for an indefinite leave of absence the day before . She 'd been working alone in a newly excavated section of the tunnels , beneath B'hala 's foundation . The ranjen Jake had talked to obviously thought highly of her , commenting several times on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientist . Jake had been careful not to ask too many questions ; until he decided what to do , he planned to take Istani 's advice . Think about it , and trust my heart . Easier said than done , when all he could think about was that his father might be waiting , expecting Jake to come and bring him home . He was too tired to think about much of anything anymore . Jake carefully wrapped the ragged parchment up and slid it into the top drawer of the desk , then stood and stretched . He had to try to get some sleep . He crawled into bed , tapping the manual light panel at the head of the cot and pulling the dusty coverlet to his chest in the sudden dark . He doubted he 'd be able to fall asleep right away , but it was his last coherent thought before he drifted off into an uneasy slumber  --  and he dreamed again of Dad , dreamed that the two of them were flying through space without a ship , his father laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the infinite black .
