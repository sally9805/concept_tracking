A master with graphite , artist and teacher Tony Ryder breaks down figure drawing into three manageable steps . <p> Capturing the human form in graphite drawings may seem intimidating , but Tony Ryder believes artists can create masterful drawings by taking a three-step approach toward taming the barrage of visual information presented by the human figure . ENVELOPE , GESTURE , AND BLOCK-IN <p> Ryder begins with an envelope of lines connecting a few widely separated points on the figure . The envelope establishes the drawing 's general proportions and institutes what the artist calls " point-to-point measurement , " the analysis of the relationship between two points as defined by the length and tilt of the straight line that connects them . <p> At the same time , or even before he draws the envelope , Ryder is conscious of the gesture of the model . He asks , " When do we really begin to draw the figure ? I think we begin before the pencil touches the paper , with a response to the pose of the model . More than anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the model . It is the fundamental energy . that patterns the whole drawing . " <p> In reality , gesture is an immaterial and invisible energy. , but Ryder looks for what he terms " the inner curve , " an imaginary-line that flows like a river through all the forms of the body , never making angular , abrupt changes of direction . " Capturing gestate , " he says , " brings the drawing to life . The figures in drawings should appear as if they were breathing , as if their hearts were beating . Gesture is the heart and soul of figure drawing . " <p> Gesture guides the anatomy of the body into the shape of the pose . This shape , expressed in its simplest form in the envelope , is more fully defined in the block-in . Constructed within the envelope , and according to the same principles , the block-in is the elaboration and continuation of the envelope . It is a complex shape approximating the appearance of the figure . The block-in shapes are strung along the inner curve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible path , " Ryder describes . " They conduct the curve as if it were a kind of electricity , a gestural current , expressed in the fluid interconnection of shapes as they progress into one another . " He refines the block-in until there is a rough but delineated outline of the figure , always keeping an eye on the flow of the gesture by establishing large axial relationships , such as the pitch of the arms and torso . <p> Ryder pays special attention to the hands , which he proclaims as " the gestural organ par excellence . Hands are one of the most expressive parts of the body and , due to their mobility , are similar to a little body in themselves . " That mobility and complexity can make drawing a hand intimidating , so Ryder recommends that artists regard the hand as an outgrowth of the gestural shape of the arm . He suggests first drawing the mitten-shaped envelope of the hand , looking at the fingers as a unit , and then noticing how they taper and overlap . " Fingers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter , " Ryder remarks . CONTOUR <p> The second step in Ryder 's figure-drawing method is contour , which is the refined outline of the figure . He notes , " The contour of the body is extremely subtle , difficult to describe accurately , and quite fascinatingly beautiful . When the contour is sensitively handled , it can stand alone , like a violin solo . " Contour consists of convex curves that delineate the horizon of the model 's body . Ryder works along the block-in section by section , imposing the curves on the straight-line segments , though not necessarily on a one-to-one basis . The artist routinely corrects the contour , erasing and redrawing small ( and sometimes not so small ) sections . INSIDE DRAWING <p> Ryder refers to the final stage as " inside drawing , " by which he " sculpts " the form of the body within the contour through gradations of tone . These gradations of tone , or tonal progressions , represent the flow of light and shadow across the figure . The most challenging aspect , says Ryder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we process visual experiences ever3 , moment of our waking lives , it seems we should be entirely familiar with the nature and behavior of light . Strangely , " he remarks , " when it comes to drawing its effects , students discover that the action of light is almost entirely unknown territory . " Therefore , inside drawing is developed in tandem with the understanding of the actions of light . <p> Ryder divides the technical aspect of drawing light and shadow into two basic skills : applying graphite to the surface of the paper in a controlled manner and developing washes of shading in a logical sequence . The control is in the deliberate work of hatching and crosshatching . " Hatching is a rhythmic activity , " he says . " The pencil moves like a sewing-machine needle . The trick is to get the lines evenly spaced , gradually increasing or decreasing in length , and in the right value range and progression . Crosshatching is hatching on top of hatching , with the layers of hatching crossing at an angle . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied in a drawing . To mist a drawing with value , crosshatching can be done very softly , as if you were applying washes of value with a brush rather than individual lines with a pencil . " <p> The second skill , shading in a logical sequence , is not so much manual as it is procedural . After creating a finely tuned contour drawing an artist may be eager to start shading . But Ryder tempers zeal with an understanding of and respect for the order of the form . " The body on the inside is subtly structured , simultaneously orderly and complex . So it should be in our drawings . But , " he says , " ordering the form on the inside must be done without lines . There are no lines in nature . " <p> Ryder locates landmarks on the inside with nearly invisible micropatches of shading , organizing them into pathways of form that collectively create a network . These networks guide Ryder through the development of the tonal progressions . For example , in Scott 's Back the landmarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create links within the contour . The artist used shadows , cast-shadow edges , and downturns in the light to organize the model 's back . <p> Ryder realizes that learning to draw is not an easy process . " I always feel like apologizing to my students for breaking the news that drawing the figure in this way is really a lifelong work of devotion , " he says . " The most important thing is consistent effort . It is also crucial that students learn to pace themselves , to work at a reasonable tempo . Insofar as possible , they should try . not to judge themselves too harshly . Progress comes imperceptibly . " <p> Ryder studied at the Art Students League of New York , the New York Academy of Art , both in New York City , and with Ted Seth Jacobs . He has distilled his drawing techniques in his book The Artist 's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing ( Watson-Guptill Publications , New York , New York ) . The artist lives in Santa Fe , New Mexico .
