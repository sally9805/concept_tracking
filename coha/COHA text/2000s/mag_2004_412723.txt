Photograph Sheryl Crow , Ben Harper and Melissa Etheridge ( left to right ) spread the word about historic women 's rights march . // THE LINE AT THE DOOR OF THE Hollywood Palladium stretched down Sunset Boulevard on a chilly Los Angeles evening in January , but spirits remained high-and determined . After all , what 's better than hearing great music , supporting a great cause and gearing up for the April 25 event that will send an unmistakable message to Washington politicians ? " I think voting is sexy . It 's hot . I do n't want to go out with a man who does n't vote ! " Sheryl Crow told the crowd of 1,800 at the Palladium before launching into her hit song " Strong Enough . " Rock for Choice began in 1991 as a way to raise awareness that reproductive rights for women were being threatened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L7 and others at the Palace in Hollywood , was so successful that it became a full-time project of the Feminist Majority . Over the years the concerts have featured Pearl Jam , Red Hot Chili Peppers , Sarah McLachlan , Rage Against The Machine and Salt ' n Pepa . This year 's concert focused on spreading the word about the march on Washington , D.C , April 25 . Singer Lisa Loeb opened the evening , followed by Ben Harper , Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow . In between music sets , a number of actors took the stage to share their thoughts and commit to the march . " I 'm here to ensure that my 7-year-old daughter has the right to design her life in the healthiest and most respectful way , " said actor/comedian Kathy Najimy , a co-organizer of the event . " I 've been talking to her about choice since she was born , in words she can understand . I tell her that we believe every child should be a wanted child-a child who is healthy and loved and cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the largest women 's rights march in our nation 's history . Organizers-including Black Women 's Health Imperative , Feminist Majority , NARAL Pro-Choice America , National Latins Institute for Reproductive Health , National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood Federation of America-are calling for the march to sound the alarm that women 's fundamental reproductive freedoms are in danger . The attacks on access to reproductive health care , including family planning and abortion , are numerous and far-reaching . The consequences are dire , especially for women of color , poor women and young women . Organizers say the march is necessary to show massive public support for reproductive health care and to make sure women 's voices-joined by those of men who care-are heard before it 's too late . For the first time since Roe v. Wade , Congress has passed , and the president signed into law , an act that criminalizes an abortion procedure . Court after court is being packed with judges hostile to women 's rights . And Roe v. Wade hangs by a razor-thin margin of 5-4 in the U.S. Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reversal of Roe . U.S. family-planning and abortion policies internationally , such as the global gag rule and the cutoff of United Nations Fund for Population Activities ( UNFPA ) funds , are contributing directly to the illness and death of countless women and girls . Each year , according to the World Health Organization , an estimated 80,000 women die from complications of illegal or unsafe abortions and hundreds of thousands are maimed and injured . Photograph Camryn Manheim // Meanwhile , back on Sunset Boulevard , the Palladium was filled with songs of love , hope and good humor . Ben Harper evoked smiles with his **33;2637;TOOLONG tune , " Mama 's Got a Girlfriend Now , " after being introduced by his life partner , actor Laura Dern . " The statistic that made me excited , " said Dern , " is that 75 percent of the U.S. is pro-choice . I know that all of us here , and the rest of the 75 percent , will never be quiet . " The energetic Etheridge , who prowled the stage to the delight of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about how one person can make a big difference : a metaphor , perhaps , that can be stretched to explain how a million individuals coming together in D.C. can make a huge statement in front of the federal government and the American public . Still more celebrities took the stage ( plus Ellen DeGeneres on videotape ) to spread the word : Nia " My Big Fat Greek Wedding " Vardalos , talk show host Ricki Lake , and surprisingly shy actor/comedian Cheri Oteri , who had to be coaxed onstage by Najimy with the promise she could pair up with Lake ; " Just say , ' Vote ! March ! Rock On , ' " urged head cheerleader Najimy . Offstage , enjoying the show from a balcony seat , the usually hilarious Oteri was very serious about why she was there . " There 's so much we take for granted , " she said . " I ca n't believe we 're in danger of losing Roe v. Wade . " The evening ended with an impassioned plea to the audience by actor Camryn Manheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your future , " she said , her voice rising . " The next time , we 'll have a victory concert for women 's right to choose ! " - MICHELE KORT Photograph Sidebar Where 's the March ?
