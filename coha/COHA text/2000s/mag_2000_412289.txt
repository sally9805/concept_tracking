In a particularly bleak year for pro athletes and their off-field problems , Bucs linebacker Derrick Brooks is a beacon of hope and charity . For his remarkable efforts on behalf of disadvantaged Tampa Bay youth , he is No. 1 on TSN 's list of 99 Good Guys in pro sports . // In a land that never heard Of Ray Lewis and Rae Carruth and Mark Chmura , Derrick Brooks is standing among a group of Africans . They 're demonstrating tribal dances , and Brooks , much to the delight of 20 giddy American teenagers standing next to him , tries to imitate the moves . Badly . The teenagers laugh and slap hands . They ca n't remember the last time they had seen anything so hilarious . To these teens , Brooks is much more than a wannabe dancer . Or one of the NFLs elite linebackers . He is a friend , a confidant , a father figure , a maker of dreams come true . On this early summer day , they are living out an adventure none ever dared imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through South Africa , a $200,000 all-expenses-paid expedition-part sightseeing , part educational-financed by Brooks so these inner-city youths can get a taste of the world that otherwise would be beyond their means . Brooks is a bachelor with jet-set wealth , yet he has chosen to spend part of the last four summers traveling with various members of the Brooks Bunch , whose membership includes all the kids at a couple of Tampa boys and girls dubs . There 's something inside of him that prods him to do stellar deeds . it 's his late grandmother , a steel-willed lady with little means who always could find an extra place at the dinner table for some needy stranger . It 's the little girl , part of a small group he took to Fort Lauderdale three years ago , who sat next to him on her first plane ride , looked into his eyes and told him , " This is the best day of my life . " It 's also the bad side of pro football , the world that Brooks avoids , the world that we hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder trial , the Cami murder charges , the Comma sexualassault charge , the drunk driving , the drug use . " With what is going on with today 's athletes , it is forcing guys to come forward to say they are doing good because we are getting a black eye , " he says sadly And it 's the testimony of a teen-aged member of the Brooks Bunch . " We really were n't bad before Derrick started coming here , " Michael Sails says , but we are a lot better now because of him . Maybe we were 49 percent OK back then , and now we are 90 percent . When we start to do something , we think about whether Derrick would approve . " Brooks is told what Sails has said , and he takes a while to reply . Ca n't let anyone see that tear . The core of his quest is all of the above , but more than anything , it is a compelling desire to influence the future of kids who desperately need guidance toward good .

It means more than buying them sneakers at Christmas or supplying 24 tickets for them to each Bucs game or even playing pickup basketball with them , when he can be just one of the guys , not some famous football star . It means piecing together a yearlong educational program that serves as motivation for his youngsters to improve their minds and behavioral skills . And the reward for those who follow his blueprint the closest grows more stunning every year . First , it was that quick plane hop to Fort Lauderdale . Then , a trip to Atlanta and the Martin Luther King Jr . Center . Then it was four days in Washington , D.C. , and a study of the intricacies of the federal government . Then South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader . " He is , " says Ricky Gallon , a former Louisville basketball player who now is director of Tampa 's Ponce de Leon Boys and Girls Club , " a remarkable man . " This certainly is the year we need a remarkable man in pro sports . Set against a background of seemingly endless misguided behavior by our pro athletes , we need someone like Derrick Brooks to remind us of all the Good Guys who dominate our major pro leagues . For every criminal act that receives publicity , there are tens of good deeds being performed by Brooks and his peers , the ones who have a heart and who truly care about their communities and the needs that exist in every town . For the second straight year , THE SPORTING NEWS is honoring the 99 top Good Guys in professional sports . These are the guys who should restore your faith in athletics , who should overwhelm the jerks who have abused their wealth and stature and demeaned their avocation , who should convince you that there still are bubble-gum heroes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy of sports . We 're happy to report that we had more than 400 nominations for these 99 spots ; this Good Guys team has plenty of depth . Among the final 99 , five in particular stood out for their exceptional community service : Troy Aikman ( NFL ) , Al Leiter ( baseball ) , Adam Graves ( NHL ) , Terry Cummings ( NBA ) - and , above everyone , Brooks . He is our No. 1 Good Guy for the year 2000 , an unassuming man with an enormous love for children . He is what being a Good Guy is all about : He does none of his work for publicity . He has no foundation director , no elaborate organization , no polished buzz words to explain his acts . He simply is a quiet , peaceful guy with an amazing capacity for giving and , evidently , for tolerance . Photograph Photograph // " You are taking how many teenagers to Africa ? " T Williams asked Brooks when she first heard about his trip plans . Williams is the mother of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what it is like to take my two on a long trip together , much less adding in 18 more kids , " she says , laughing . " But Derrick just shrugged his shoulders . My goodness , if he ever gets married , he surely wo n't have any surprises when it comes to how kids behave . " lust of all , the trip itself seemed unimaginable , even ( to longstanding Brooks Bunchers . Africa . Derrick could n't possibly mean it . And how was he going to decide from among all the kids who surely would Now that Brooks is back from the June 24 July 5 trip , he can laugh about the initial reactions . But there were times he wondered himself about the complexities of the proposed journey . Even with the able assistance of the Bucs ' community-relations staff , the layers that had to be covered during the months before takeoff were daunting : plane , hotel and restaurant plans for the 20 kids and 19 adults , including coach Tony Dunk and his wife ; photos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure everything took place without incident ; clothing , luggage and miscellaneous supplies for everyone because to travel right , these kids had to look and act right . The costs mounted as Brooks kept adding children ( originally 12 were to go ) . But Brooks never wavered . Nor walked away from the work . " That 's what really impresses me about Derrick , " says Bertha Gary , director of Tampa 's Ybor City Boys and Girls Club . " He is incredibly hands-on . He 's not one of these athletes who gives money and has cameras take his picture , and then you never see him again . He is in the middle of everything . He does n't dominate ; he blends in . But he knows exactly what is happening . " The core of the Africa trip was a nine-month educational course about that continent funded by Brooks that each prospective trip participant had to attend . Starting last October and ending in April , classes were held every other week at the Ponce and Ybor clubs ; only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruction ; the curriculum included everything from geography to history to specific lessons on Nelson Mandela and apartheid . Each of the youngsters , who ranged in age from 13 to 17 and included some candidates from an Orlando club , was required to keep a journal during classes . At the end , they had to present an essay to a panel about why they should be chosen . They also had to maintain a 2.5 grade-point average in school and meet expected levels in attendance and behavior . Brooks would have taken every child who qualified , but logistics and security concerns limited him to 20 . For most of these disadvantaged youngsters , who attend some of the most underfunded Tampa and Orlando schools , the class requirements were a challenge . Many could not even write a five-paragraph essay , and it became a goal of Brooks and his instructors that they at least learn that fundamental skill by the end of the nine months . That 's why Brooks considers the educational aspect as the major reason to plan the trips . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want them to be good people . I let them know , if you can change for six to eight months , you can continue to be better for a lifetime . I want to affect their lives positively , not just for an extended period , but forever . If they can come in and at least step apart from the pack and become leaders , that is what I want . I want to plant a seed that will glow " When I first started with the Bucs , I had a ticket program for these kids . But that was n't enough . I felt I was cheating myself . I just thank the Lord that he gave me an itch to do more . I came to the ( Ponce ) dub five years ago because I wanted to visit the kids who got the tickets . If I did n't have personal contact and personal/ze my message and have them hear my vision , then just giving tickets was useless . " I sit down and talk to them and get to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I am going to be the message about school and drugs and conduct , then I want to be real . I do n't want to put up a facade . I do think there have been some changes in these kids over the years , something as simple as my guys opening doors for the ladies or the ladies sitting in a room with their legs crossed and using better language . All I ask from them is respect-respect me , respect each other , respect authority-and get your grades up and be happy and get involved and do n't be wasting your time . " Brooks usually comes unannounced to the clubs . He just walks in and starts talking to the kids . They have learned to trust him . He has heard horrible stories of abuse , of family breakups , of temptations . Many of the children have no dads at home ; some live with their grandparents . The clubs are their sanctuary ; Brooks is a symbol that the athletes they worship can be real and trustworthy .

" Hey , James , " Brooks says to a club member during a recent visit " How is that PE . grade ? " Brooks had learned that the boy was underperforming in the loss . He informed him of his disappointment The youngster got the message ; he happily told Brooks that he had passed the loss with ease . Brooks grew up poor and happy in Pensacola , Fla He is intelligent and a quick learner , but school bored him . He became the class clown until the fifth grade , when his stepdad , tired of getting calls from the principal about his son 's mischievous behavior , spanked him in front of his class .

" We are constantly trying to get him to scale back what he wants to give the kids , " says Stephanie Waller , the Bucs ' community-relations director . " He wanted to give each of them $1,000 to spend in Africa . " He reluctantly reduced it to $500 , with limits on how it could be spent . But he cheats . On the D.C. trip , some kids spotted a Nike store . Within minutes , he gave them permission to each buy a pair of shoes . Maximum price : $75 .

" Because I have never been there , either , " Brooks says , " and it is the motherland for these kids . So much of their heritage is tied up in this continent How better for them to be educated ? " So , in a whirlwind of plane rides , bus trips and jeep excursions , Brooks and his bunch jammed a month 's worth of wanderings into a blink of an eye . They toured an iron-ore mine , met a U.S. ambassador , dressed up and rode in vintage cars to dinner , ate crocodile and ostrich around a campfire at a safari base camp with wild animals howling in the night , visited a candle factory , sat in horror as a mother elephant staged a mock charge at their Land Rover , flew to Swaziland , munched on KFC and McDonald 's when native food became too much , saw a baboon steal one of their backpacks , biked along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of Table Mountain , visited with students at a local high school and laughed at Jackass penguins , which make noises like donkeys . The serious moments came in flurries . They spent time in Soweto , where Nelson Mandela lived before he was imprisoned Poor and horribly overcrowded , Soweto stirred emotions . They saw women practicing witchcraft and a squatters camp full of small huts , with no electricity or running water . When they handed out small gifts , the crowds almost became overwhelming . They had never seen a situation in which there was so much need and wanting . They also took a ferry to Robber Island , where Mandela was imprisoned for 26 years . The trip almost was canceled because of an oil spill ; the smell in the water was putrid , the sight of penguins saturated with oil sad . A tour guide who had been in jail for seven years led them through the prison . Its sterility and severity brought silence . They also saw tribal Africans dance ; the Americans tried to teach their new friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational purpose of the trip , he reminded them to make entries in their journals , which he collected at trip 's end .

" Seeing Soweto , it makes you appreciate what we have , living in America . It makes me not want to take anything for granted . Some of those people had no toilet paper . I complain I do n't have anything , but I have a lot more than they do . " Brooks came away satisfied the trip had served its propose . " The kids were wonderful , " he says .

" I 'm just grateful they let me be part of their world , " he says . " I owe them ways to keep them challenged from a mental standpoint . And to be a positive influence in their lives .
