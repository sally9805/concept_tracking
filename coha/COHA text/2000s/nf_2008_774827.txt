Every election season America is presented with a series of false choices . Should we launch preemptive wars against this country or that one ? Should every American neighborhood live under this social policy or that one ? Should a third of our income be taken away by an income tax or a national sales tax ? The shared assumptions behind these questions , on the other hand , are never cast in doubt , or even raised . And anyone who wants to ask different questions or who suggests that the questions as framed exclude attractive , humane alternatives , is ipso facto excluded from mainstream discussion . // And so every four years we are treated to the same tired , predictable routine : two candidates with few disagreements on fundamentals pretend that they represent dramatically different philosophies of government . // The supposedly conservative candidate tells us about " waste " in government , and ticks off $10 million in frivolous pork-barrel projects that outrage him-the inevitable bridge-to-nowhere project , or a study of the effects of celery consumption on arresting memory loss-in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that 's 0.00045 percent of the federal budget dealt with ; what does he propose to do with the other 99.99955 percent , in order to return our country to living within its means ? Not a word . Those same three or four silly programs will be brought up all campaign long , and that 's all we 'll hear about where the candidate stands on spending . But conservatives are told that they must support these candidates , and so they do , hoping for the best . And nothing changes . // Even war does n't really distinguish the two parties from each other . Hillary Clinton and John Kerry voted for the Iraq war . With the exceptions of Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel , even the Democrats who postured as antiwar candidates for the 2008 primary elections are not especially opposed to needless wars . They typically have a laundry list of other military interventions they would support , none of which make any sense , would make our country any safer , or would do a thing to return our country to fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these candidates , and so they do , hoping for the best . And nothing changes . // A substantial portion of the conservative movement has become a parody of its former self . Once home to distinguished intellectuals and men of letters , it now tolerates and even encourages anti-intellectualism and jingoism that would have embarrassed earlier generations of conservative thinkers . There are still some good and decent conservative leaders to be found , and a portion of the grass roots has remained uncorrupted by the transformation of conservatism into just another Big Government movement . But Big Government at home and abroad seems to suit many conservative spokesmen just fine . Once in a while they will latch on to phony but conservative-sounding causes like " tax reform " - almost always a shell game in which taxes are shuffled around rather than actually reduced overall-in order to pacify the conservative base , but that 's about it . // When Republicans won a massive off-year election victory in 1994 , neoconservative Bill Kristol immediately urged them not to do anything drastic but to wait until the Republicans took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't take the White House in 1996 , so nothing ever got done . Instead , the Republican leadership urged these freshman congressmen to focus on a toothless , soporific agenda called the Contract with America that was boldly touted as a major overhaul of the federal government . Nothing could have been further from the truth . The Contract with America was typical of what I have just described : no fundamental questions are ever raised , and even supposedly radical and revolutionary measures turn out to be modest and safe . In fact , the Brookings Institution in effect said that if this is what conservatives consider revolutionary , then they have basically conceded defeat . // Needless to say , I am also unimpressed by the liberal Left . Although they posture as critical thinkers , their confidence in government is inexcusably naive , based as it is on civics-textbook platitudes that bear absolutely zero resemblance to reality . Not even their position on unnecessary wars is consistent-Hillary Clinton and John Kerry both supported the Iraq war , for instance , and the major Democratic candidates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invade some other country apart from Iraq . Even Howard Dean was all in favor of Bill Clinton 's intervention in Bosnia , going so far as to urge the president to take unilateral military action beyond the multilateral activity already taking place . Liberals at the grass roots , on the other hand , have been deeply alienated by the various betrayals by which a movement they once supported has made its peace with the establishment . // No wonder frustrated Americans have begun referring to our two parties as the Republicrats . And no wonder the news networks would rather focus on $400 haircuts than matters of substance . There are no matters of substance . // In late 2006 , a number of friends and colleagues urged me to consider running for president . I was a reluctant candidate , not at all convinced that a sizable enough national constituency existed for a campaign based on liberty and the Constitution rather than on special-interest pandering and the distribution of loot. // Was I ever wrong . // On November 5 , 2007 , we set a record when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That December 16 , on the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party , we broke that record by raising over $6 million . In the fourth quarter of 2007 , we raised more money than any other Republican candidate . Not only is the freedom message popular , but if fund-raising ability is any indication , it is more intensely popular than any other political message . // By the end of 2007 , more than twice as many Meetup groups had been formed in support of our campaign than for all the rest of the candidates in both major parties combined . I have never seen such a diverse coalition rallying to a single banner . Republicans , Democrats , Independents , Greens , constitutionalists , whites , blacks , Hispanics , Asian-Americans , antiwar activists , home-schoolers , religious conservatives , freethinkers-all were not only involved , but enthusiastically so . And despite their philosophical differences in some areas , these folks typically found , to their surprise , that they rather liked each other . // The mainstream media had no idea what to make of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still attracting such a varied and passionate following . I began making this a central point of my public speeches : the reason all these different groups are rallying to the same banner , I said , is that freedom has a unique power to unite us. // In case that sounds like a clich ? , it is n't . It 's common sense . When we agree not to treat each other merely as means to our own selfish ends , but to respect one another as individuals with rights and goals of our own , cooperation and goodwill suddenly become possible for the first time . // My message is one of freedom and individual rights . I believe individuals have a right to life and liberty and that physical aggression should be used only defensively . We should respect each other as rational beings by trying to achieve our goals through reason and persuasion rather than threats and coercion . That , and not a desire for " economic efficiency , " is the primary moral reason for opposing government intrusions into our lives : government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am speaking of principles foreign to the Republican tradition . But listen to the words of Robert A. Taft , who in the old days of the Republican Party was once its standard-bearer : // When I say liberty I do not simply mean what is referred to as " free enterprise . " I mean liberty of the individual to think his own thoughts and live his own life as he desires to think and to live ; the liberty of the family to decide how they wish to live , what they want to eat for breakfast and for dinner , and how they wish to spend their time ; liberty of a man to develop his ideas and get other people to teach those ideas , if he can convince them that they have some value to the world ; liberty of every local community to decide how its children shall be educated , how its local services shall be run , and who its local leaders shall be ; liberty of a man to choose his own occupation ; and liberty of a man to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , as long as he does not interfere with the right of other people to do the same thing . // As we 'll see in a later chapter , Taft was also an opponent of needless wars and of unconstitutional presidential war-making. // This is the Republican tradition to which I belong . // Early on in my presidential campaign , people began describing my message and agenda as a " revolution . " In a way , it is , albeit a peaceful one . In a country with a political debate as restricted as ours , it is revolutionary to ask whether we need troops in 130 countries and whether the noninterventionist foreign policy recommended by our Founding Fathers might not be better . It is revolutionary to ask whether the accumulation of more and more power in Washington has been good for us . It is revolutionary to ask fundamental questions about privacy , police-state measures , taxation , social policy , and countless other matters . // This revolution , though , is not altogether new . It is a peaceful continuation of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-government , the Constitution , and a noninterventionist foreign policy . That is what they taught us , and that is what we now defend . // I was never interested in writing a campaign book as they tend to have ( deservedly ) short shelf lives . But the ideas I have been promoting , and which have struck such a powerful chord with so many Americans , are ideas that are overlooked and neglected because they do not fit into the template of trivial questions with which I opened this chapter . This book is an opportunity to highlight and explain them in the kind of systematic fashion that campaign speeches and presidential debates simply do not allow . // The revolution my supporters refer to will persist long after my retirement from politics . Here is my effort to given them a long-term manifesto based on ideas , and perhaps some short-term marching orders . // At the same time , I am also describing what the agenda of George W. Bush 's successor should be if we want to move toward a free society once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the questions our political and media establishments allow us to ask are so narrow . Whether or not politicians actually want to hear them , it has never been more important for us to begin posing significant and fundamental questions . " In all affairs , " Bertrand Russell once said , " it 's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted . " I 'm not in the habit of quoting Russell , but when in American history has his sentiment been more true ? // ( Continues ... ) //
