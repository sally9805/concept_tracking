<p> The recent announcement of Mayor Daley 's planned cross-country bicycle trip vividly demonstrates the recreational and health benefits of cycling , as well as Daley 's altruistic nature in using the trip to raise money for charity . However , Chicago 's cycling community may well wonder why the mayor is willing to ride the highways from coast to coast but will not ride the streets of his own city . <p> Even though the Daley administration has provided many amenities for cyclists , including the omnipresent bike racks and miles of new bike lanes , these efforts have failed to confront a harsh reality  --  Chicago 's car-clogged streets discourage many would-be urban cyclists , including the mayor himself . <p> While Daley enjoys bike riding on the quiet back roads near his Michigan cottage or his cross-country trip , the city transportation system worsens with the malignant neglect of CTA and the increase of downtown traffic . <p> To be fair , Daley inherited a city with a long history of transportation inequity and skullduggery . Back in the ' 40s , Chicago 's streetcars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bought up by General Motors and destroyed in order to force consumers to buy its vehicles . The company was let off with a token fine of $ 5,000 , but 50 years later we still live with this legacy of government complicity in corporate abuse as road infrastructure proliferates and public transportation crumbles . <p> As Daley begins the new millennium with his two-wheeled journey , Chicago transportation advocates also want to inspire a new era of transportation dialogue . There is a better way , a transportation policy that promotes bicycles and public transportation : modes that pollute less , cost less , save time and resources  --  and just plain make more sense . To dramatize their concerns , Chicago cyclists and public transportation advocates have targeted the most blatant symbol of our Byzantine transportation system  --  the Chicago Auto Show . Hundreds will cycle from Daley Plaza at noon Feb. 12 and farther for a demonstration at the entrance to the show at McCormick Place . <p> It 's time to take the exit ramp from a bankrupt transportation legacy and blaze a new path into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improving the quality of life for all . <p> Michael Burton , chairman , <p> Chicago Bike Winter , <p> Jim Redd , treasurer , <p> Critical Mass Legal Defense Fund <p> Hooray , Fisk ; boo , Sox <p> Congratulations to Carlton Fisk on becoming a member of Baseball 's Hall of Fame . Yes , he 'll probably enter the Hall wearing a Boston cap , but let 's not forget that he remained in the Chicago area after his playing days . Was n't it great to see him hold the news conference here in Chicago ? <p> Considering how he feels about Jerry Reinsdorf , the message was n't lost on Sox fans that he held the conference at , of all places , Harry Caray 's restaurant . It should have been held at the Comiskey Park Stadium Club , with a big White Sox logo as a backdrop behind the podium . Is n't it a shame that Reinsdorf and Co. dropped the ball again on promoting the Sox and their place in this city ? <p> K. Payne , Lisle <p> No. 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rules involved with the cap of choice for Carlton Fisk 's upcoming plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame , but when I envision it , the team logo is not visible . I see Pudge the way I saw him countless times . His cap backward and his mask lifted up , resting on top of his head . Congratulations to Pudge ! He deserves the accolades , and deserved to be treated better by both organizations for whom he toiled so hard and so well . <p> Daniel T. O'Neill , <p> Near North Side <p> American arrogance <p> I was surprised that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Serviced decided to return Elian Gonzalez , the Cuban boy found in the waters off Florida 's coast . <p> This is a very complex situation , pitting the basic traditional rights of a father ( who was separated from the boy 's mother and remains in Cuba ) with opposing political views as to what form of government one should live under . <p> Relatives in Miami pampered the boy as news cameras followed their every move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the Cuban government that now finds itself severely depressed under Fidel Castro 's dictatorship . <p> This debacle surely reminded some of us of the Walter Polovchak incident some years ago , in which a family migrated here from Ukraine , and after a time , decided to return . Although he was only 12 , Polovchak refused to return with his family . The State Department stepped in and took the boy 's side . This case dragged on for years ; finally , after six years , the boy turned 18 and was permitted by law to decide for himself . <p> Gonzalez is far too young to make this decision . His blood father is entitled to make it for him now that Elian 's mother is dead . When a government ( no matter how powerful and economically viable ) intercedes between the rights of a father to decide what is best for his child , that government is way out of line . <p> America may be prosperous , but it surely is n't a perfect country . When some million and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newborn babies are routinely abandoned to die in trash cans ; when school kids are shooting one another ; when half of our young , black male population is in jail ; when movie actors with their flighty , permissive , selfish , devil-may-care attitudes have become our main role models ; when making money at near any social cost takes precedence over traditional moral responsibilities such as rearing our children properly and caring for our elderly , when half of our children and millions of our adults do not have adequate medical care , then we are in deep trouble as a society . <p> Al Carli , Archer Heights <p> Plan for a rainy day <p> We laud the position of the Sun-Times in recognizing the effort of Cook County Assessor James Houlihan to attract businesses and jobs to Cook County . <p> Your editorial ( " Sensible tax plan , " Jan. 19 ) noted with accuracy the increasingly difficult struggle that businesses face operating in Cook County with such disparate tax rate assessments . The plan developed by Houlihan is both progressive and sound . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum , a coalition of business , civic and neighborhood organizations , which worked with the assessor to seek solutions to the threat of a continuing loss of businesses and industry in Cook County . This loss of business , as well as any inability to increase our business base , would have a profound impact on residential taxpayers . <p> In such rosy economic times , it is wise to look at activities that will ensure continued economic growth and spur the development of businesses and jobs . <p> Norman R. Bobins , chairman , <p> Board of Directors , <p> Scott B. Hill , chairman , <p> Taxation Committee , <p> Chicagoland Chamber <p> of Commerce <p> Spirit of fairness <p> The recent decision by U.S. District Court Judge Joan B. Gottschall ordering a preliminary injunction of the Illinois Wine and Spirits Industry Fair Dealing Act is a triumph for free enterprise ( " Judge bars liquor law , " Jan. 8 ) . <p> By halting the enforcement of this law , the judge has preserved freedom of commerce and open competition , two fundamental principles upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great commercial competitor such as William Wirtz would ever feel it necessary to seek legislation to shelter his business from competition . <p> It is unfortunate that Wirtz impugned the integrity of America 's leading distillers by positioning this legislation as protection for state distributors from foreign-owned distillers . In today 's global economy , a multitude of companies with a foreign interest operate throughout the United States . This diverse and global economy has led to the greatest prosperity in American history . <p> Peter H. Cressy , <p> president and CEO , <p> Distilled Spirits Council <p> of the United States , <p> Washington , D.C. <p> Mediocrity rules <p> Steve Neal 's column ( Jan. 12 ) about the death of union boss Edward T. Hanley lays out yet again descriptions of Illinois ' most corrupt politicians . With all due respect to Hanley and his family , I 'm not sure if I would be honored by having ex-con Dan Rostenkowski and noted career pol Ald. Edward M. Burke ( 14th ) speak at my funeral . Neal 's column also includes revelations about U.S. Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It continues to amaze me that Illinois citizens continue to allow such politicians to remain in office , with laughably high popularity . I guess if the garbage gets picked up and the street gets plowed and most of us have jobs , that 's good enough . Well , it should n't be . <p> Mike Carniello , <p> Mount Prospect <p> Just good clean fun <p> Here 's hoping for continued success in the return to TV of " Who Wants to Be a Millionaire .
