The Courage Consort To all those who sing lustily and with good courage , and to all who only wish they could ON THE DAY THE GOOD NEWS arrived , Catherine spent her first few waking hours toying with the idea of jumping out the window of her apartment . Toying was perhaps too mild a word ; she actually opened the window and sat on the sill , wondering if four storeys was enough to make death certain . She did n't fancy the prospect of quadriplegia , as she hated hospitals , with their peculiar synthesis of fuss and boredom . Straight to the grave was best . If she could only drop from a height of a thousand storeys into soft , spongy ground , maybe her body would even bury itself on impact . ' Good news , Kate , ' said her husband , not raising his voice though he was hidden away in the study , reading the day 's mail . ' Oh yes ? ' she said , pressing one hand against the folds of her dressing gown to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The fortnight 's rehearsal in Martinekerke 's come through . ' Catherine was looking down at the ground far below . Half a dozen brightly dressed children were loitering around in the car park , and she wondered why they were n't at school . Then she wondered what effect it would have on them to see a woman falling , apparently from the sky , and bursting like a big fruit right before their eyes . At the thought of that , she felt a trickle of mysterious natural chemical entering her system , an injection of something more effective than her antidepressants . ' Is . . . is it a school holiday , darling ? ' she called to Roger , slipping off the sill back onto the carpet . The Berber plush felt hot against herfrigid bare feet , as if it had just come out of a tumble dryer . Taking a couple of steps , she found she was numb from waist to knee . ' School holiday ? I do n't know , ' her husband replied , with an edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the walls . ' July the sixth through to the twentieth . ' Catherine hobbled to the study , running her fingers through her tangled hair . ' No , no , ' she said , poking her head round the door . ' Today . Is today a school holiday ? ' Roger , seated at his desk as usual , looked up from the letter he was holding in his hands . His reading glasses sat on the end of his nose , and he peered forbearingly over them . His PC 's digital stomach emitted a discreet nirp . ' I would n't have the foggiest , ' he said . At fifty-two years old , a silver-haired veteran of a marriage that had remained carefully childless for three decades , he obviously felt he 'd earned the right to be hazy on such details . ' Why ? ' Already forgetting , she shrugged . Her dressing gown slipped off her naked shoulder , prompting one of his eyebrows to rise . At the same moment , she noticed he was n't in pyjamas any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown back up , she strained to recall how she and Roger had managed to start the day on such unequal footing . Had they got up together this morning ? Had they even slept together , or was it one of those nights when she curled up in the guest bedroom , listening to the muted plainsong of his CDs through the wall , waiting for silence ? She could n't remember ; the days were a chaos in her brain . Last night was already long ago . Smiling gamely , she scanned his desk for his favourite mug and could n't spot it . ' I 'll put the kettle on , shall I ? ' she offered . He produced his mug of hot coffee out of nowhere . ' Some lunch , perhaps , ' he said . Determined to carry on as normal , Roger picked up the telephone and dialled the number of Julian Hind . Julian 's answering machine came on , and his penetrating tenor sang : ' Be-elzebub has a devil put aside for me-e-e . . . for me-e-e . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soprano without any loss of volume . Roger had learned by now to hold the telephone receiver away from his ear until the singing stopped . ' Hello , ' said the voice then , ' Julian Hind here . If you have a devil put aside for me , or anything else for that matter , do leave a message after the tone . ' Roger left the message , knowing that Julian was probably hovering near the phone , his floppy-fringed head cocked to one side , listening . Next , Roger dialled Dagmar 's number . It rang for a long time before she responded , making Roger wonder whether she 'd gone AWOL again , mountain climbing . Surely she 'd have given that a rest , though , in the circumstances ! ' Yes ? ' she replied chat . ' Hello , it 's Roger , ' he said . ' Roger who ? ' There was a hornlike sonority to the vowels , even on the telephone . ' Roger Courage . ' ' Oh , hallo , ' she said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just clamped the receiver between jaw and shoulder . ' I was just talking to a Roger . He was trying to sell me some thermal climbing gear for about a million pounds . You did n't sound like him . ' ' Indeed I hope not , ' said Roger , as the nonsense prattle of Dagmar 's baby began to google in his ear . ' This is to do with the fortnight in Martinekerke . ' ' Let me guess , ' said Dagmar , with the breezily scornful mistrust of the State-any State-that came to her so readily . ' They are telling us blah-blah , funding cuts , current climate , regrets . . . ' ' Well , no , actually : it 's going ahead . ' ' Oh . ' She sounded almost disappointed . ' Excellent . ' Then , before she hung up : ' We do n't have to travel together , do we ? ' After a sip of coffee , Roger rang Benjamin Lamb . ' Ben Lamb , ' boomed the big man himself . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortnight in Martinekerke is going ahead . ' ' Good . Sixth of July to twentieth , yes ? ' ' Yes . ' ' Good . ' ' Good . . . Well , see you at the terminal , then . ' ' Good . ' Bye . ' Roger replaced the receiver and leaned back in his swivel chair . The score of Pino Fugazza 's Partitum Mutante , which , before the calls , had been glowing on his PC monitor in all its devilish complexity , had now been replaced by a screen saver . A coloured sphere was ricocheting through the darkness of space , exploding into brilliant fragments , then reassembling in a different hue , over and over again . Roger nudged the mouse with one of his long , strong fingers . Pino Fugazza 's intricate grid of notes jumped out of the blackness , illuminating the screen . The cursor was where Roger had left it , hesitating under something he was n't convinced was humanly possible to sing . ' Soup is served , ' said Catherine , entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She placed it on his desk , well away from the keyboard as she 'd been taught . He watched her as she was bending over ; she 'd put a T-shirt on underneath her dressing gown . ' Thanks , ' he said . ' Any French rolls left ? ' She grinned awkwardly , tucking a lock of her greying hair behind one ear . ' I just tried to freshen them up a bit in the microwave . I do n't know what went wrong . Their molecular structure seems to have changed completely . ' He sighed , stirring the soup with the spoon . ' Five to ten seconds is all they ever need , ' he reminded her . ' Mm , ' she said , her attention already wandering outside the window over his shoulder . Meticulous though she could be with musical tempos , she was having a lot of trouble lately , in so-called ordinary life , telling the difference between ten seconds and ten years . ' I do hope this chteau is a cheerful place , ' she murmured as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , would n't it ? For people in our position to bother going there ? ' Roger grunted encouragingly , his face slightly eerie in the glow of the monitor through the haze of soup steam . Roger Courage 's Courage Consort were , arguably , the seventh-most-renowned serious vocal ensemble in the world . Certainly they were more uncompromising than some of the more famous groups : they 'd never sunk so low as to chant Renaissance accompaniment to New Age saxophone players , or to warble Lennon/McCartney chestnuts at the Proms . A little-known fact was that , of all the purely vocal ensembles in the world , the Courage Consort had the highest proportion of contemporary pieces in their repertoire . Whereas others might cruise along on a diet of antique favourites and the occasional foray into the twentieth century , the Courage Consort were always open to a challenge from the avant-garde . No one had performed Stockhausen 's Stimmung as often as they ( four times in Munich , twice in Birmingham , and once , memorably , in Reykjavik ) , and they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could confidently claim to be friends of the younger generation-indeed , two of their members were under forty , Dagmar Belotte being only twenty-seven . Fearlessly forward-looking , they were already signed up for the Barcelona Festival in 2005 , to sing a pugnaciously postmillennial work called 2K+5 by the enfant terrible of Spanish vocal music , Paco Barrios . And now , they had been granted two weeks ' rehearsal time in an eighteenth-century chteau in rural Belgium , to prepare the unleashing of Pino Fugazza 's fearsome Partitum Mutante onto an unsuspecting world .
