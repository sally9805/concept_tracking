Is a movie , these days , ever finished ? Decades after Star Wars and its two sequels were released , George Lucas updated the special effects of some scenes . He said he was " completing " the films , although he had n't told the hundreds of millions who bought tickets to the original movies that they were watching a rough cut . <P> Now two other famous trilogies have been given the lavish , **34;17244;TOOLONG DVD treatment . Peter Jackson has added 50 " new " minutes to the already capacious 200 of The Return of the King , the final installment of his Lord of the Rings epic ( New Line Home Entertainment ; $79.92 ) . And a year after The Matrix huffed to its tri-part finale , the Wachowski brothers offer literally dozens of hours of elucidation on a 10-disc DVD set called The Ultimate Matrix Collection ( Warner Home Video ; $79.92 ) . <P> In the longer Return of the King ( which is buttressed by six-plus hours of nifty documentary footage ) , you will see a hail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army of the Dead . The Mouth of Sauron , a creature with really scary teeth , rides out to tell Aragorn that Frodo has been killed . Jackson ( who can be glimpsed playing a pirate ) also solves the riddle of the " wizard kebab "  --  a photo , snapped on the set , of a white-robed man impaled on a huge spike . It 's Saruman , fallen to his death . <P> This " full " version might not have won an Oscar for Best Picture  --  only for longest . But quibbling is not an option for a guest at this rich banquet . In theaters , the audience soared on the wings of a magical adventure . Here they move into Middle-earth . It 's a glorious place to live . <P> Jackson 's trilogy ended on a triumphant note : Return of the King won 11 Oscars and became one of only two films ( the other is Titanic ) to earn more than $1 billion in theaters . The Matrix , fairly or not , is seen as a terrific film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The Ultimate Matrix is the Wachowskis ' grand play to establish the three films as one fabulous story . They do n't pull it off , but there are goodies galore in this package . <P> For insights into the subtle direction of actors , watch as Larry Wachowski gives cues to star Keanu Reeves , suspended on wires for a fight scene , in a manner Ingmar Bergman may never have considered : " Head jerk . Then thrashing . Then a big thrash . And another one . Then clench . Tighter . And die . " <P> The package contains two commentary tracks on the full trilogy : one by " philosophers " Cornel West ( who had a small role on the Matrix council ) and Ken Wilber , the other by top film critics Todd McCarthy , John Powers and David Thomson , who connects The Matrix to every movie from Cocteau 's Orpheus to the Alien quartet . The critics are unanimous in thinking that one Matrix was enough ( " If the whole series ends here , " Thomson opines at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masterpiece " ) and that some scenes are n't worth remarking on . " Perhaps they 'll edit it out of the DVD , " Powers says . " Actually , I propose that they should start releasing Critics ' Cuts of films . " If so , they 'd all run about 83 minutes .
