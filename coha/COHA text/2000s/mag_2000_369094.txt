We have long had reason to believe that the Mars we see today is not the Mars that once was . That bleak , freeze-dried world , most planetary scientists agree , was once a warm , wet place , running with rivers and sloshing with seas or oceans . None of that water remains , of course , but the riverbeds and basins stamped in the surface offer powerful arguments that it was there in abundance . <P> Now NASA has come up with the most striking evidence yet . The Mars Global Surveyor , which has been orbiting the Red Planet since 1997 , has returned an album of images that show in brilliant detail outcroppings of layered rock , some more than two miles deep , that appear to be the remains of lake beds dating back more than 3.5 billion years . Why should lakes be important on a planet that we already knew had rivers and seas ? Because the newly discovered formations precisely resemble the sedimentary depressions that have yielded some of Earth 's richest fossil lodes . If life once thrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these geological layer cakes are where we are most likely to find its remains . <P> It 's impossible to determine from orbital images if any evidence of Martian life is actually hidden in the rocks . But the new pictures point to spots where robots or astronauts could one day land and dig  --  and perhaps find out for sure . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
