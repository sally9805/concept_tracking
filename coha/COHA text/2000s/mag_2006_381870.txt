No one could accuse David Crosby of having led a boring life . A founding member of the Byrds and Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young , the veteran musician has made even more headlines for his turbulent personal life . Crosby , who appeared at Woodstock , has gone to prison for possession of a firearm and drugs , been in a serious motorcycle crash , gone broke , taken heroin , had a liver transplant and fathered six children , two of them as a sperm donor . He recounts his colorful story in his new book , Since Then : How I Survived Everything and Lived to Tell About It ( Putnam ) , which will be published in November . TIME 'S Andrea Sachs spoke with Crosby : <P> You just finished a concert tour . How did that go ? <P> Wonderfully . We had new songs that Neil Young had written . They were very political and very strong . A large part of our job is to make you boogie and make you feel good , but part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who says it 's 11 o ' clock and all 's well . Or it 's 12:30 , and we have a chimpanzee in the White House and things are a little bit problematic . <P> How do you view the 1960s now ? <P> I think we were right about everything except the drugs . We were right about civil rights ; we were right about human rights ; we were right about peace being better than war . Most of the causes we espoused then were correct . But I think we did n't know our butt from a hole in the ground about drugs , and that bit us pretty hard . <P> In 1985 you went to jail for possession of drugs and a firearm . What was that experience like ? <P> It was very tough . It was a Texas prison . It is a very straight-up , hard , full-out high-security prison . It was not fun at all , but it was a good lesson , and it allowed me time to wake up from being a junkie , which I think is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around with you . <P> Your 1994 liver transplant was controversial . At the time , there were some people who said you got special treatment because you are a celebrity . <P> Nobody gets special treatment . It 's the most severely regulated thing you can imagine . Nobody can jump the line at all in any way . I waited . I was in the hospital for 71 days , and I came within a week of dying before they matched my liver . <P> What made you decide to be a sperm donor for singer Melissa Etheridge and her former partner Julie Cypher ? <P> Actually I did n't decide . My wife did . They were wanting to have a child , and it was proving very difficult for them , as I think it has been for a number of lesbians . She volunteered me , and I thought about it for a minute . They had been in love for a long time and were doing very well , and I thought , you know , I do n't really care about the plumbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's love there , and there was . I guess the proof is in the pudding . The kids turned out wonderfully . <P> Which young musicians who are popular now do you like ? <P> I 'm very fond of Jack Johnson . I think he came up with his own new style , and he writes really well . I really like a group called Nickel Creek . I think they 're brilliant . I 'm very fond of this little pop girl , Pink , because she wrote this song , Dear Mr. President . Holy s , what a song ! Whoa . The girl has real talent . <P> You turned 65 in August . What 's that been like ?
