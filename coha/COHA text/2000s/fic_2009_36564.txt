Every woman in Texas has a dirty little secret . A secret that could destroy her reputation , crush her fragile confidence , and sully her good name forever . <p> The most common Texas dirty little secret had to do with strippers . Here 's how that one went : Wealthy Texas oilman divorces first wife for second wife . Second wife bears children , dresses in expensive designer clothes , and builds impressive rococo-style swirling McMansion , complete with French chandeliers and full-time gardener . Second wife joins " society " and becomes philanthropic . She is photographed at all of the best events in the best clothes . Her friends are similarly wealthy , powerful , and stylish . Second wife 's dirty little secret is that she met her wealthy husband while dancing the pole at the Men 's Club in Las Vegas , or worse , Tampa . <p> Kathleen Connor King had two dirty little secrets . The good news was that neither of them had to do with stripping . The bad news was that she was poor . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret is that everyone assumed Kathleen was wildly rich . Everyone who was anyone in Houston , that is . She 'd been born a King . As in " the Kings " from Houston . As in owning most of the oil in the surrounding counties . Which was more fuel than anyone could possibly imagine . Except maybe the folks over at Shell , Exxon , and Texaco . <p> Carrying the last name of King trumped everything else about Kat . It did n't matter that she was artistic and wore all the wrong clothes . For other girls  --  plain girls without King in their last name  --  this would equate to social suicide . But Kathleen was simply viewed as eccentric . Wildly rich and eccentric ! How exciting , everyone thought . And so Kat was extended all the courtesies that the Houston socialite set could afford . Free tickets to the best events . The Houston Opera Ball , the Contemporary Arts Museum Gala , the grand opening of this restaurant or that boutique ; and , of course , the most fashionable charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , wearing clothes she 'd picked out from Twice Around Texas , her favorite thrift store . She was a trendsetter , to say the least . No one knew it was because she could n't afford the designer stuff . The other society women , in their Gucci , HermFs , and Carolina Herrera , fawning over Kat in her funky , vintage threads . <p> The sham continued right onto the society pages . The Guccis , HermFs , and Carolina Herreras always made sure to be photographed with her . To be seen in the society pages with their arms looped around little ol ' Kat , as if they were best friends forever . As if they bothered to get to know her . But they did n't . As much as Kat tried , they did n't bother to understand her personality , her flair , her art . <p> This was why Kat was drinking an ice-cold Corona straight from the bottle . She was nursing a splitting headache . Even after two extra-strength Tylenols chased down with beer , the pain radiated across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache had started earlier this afternoon . When the Guccis had suggested an afternoon of shopping at Neiman Marcus followed by Botox treatments at the medical spa in Uptown Park , Kat countered with African tribal dancing , which was free on Wednesdays in Hermann Park . <p> The Guccis looked at her funny , smiled politely , and said : <p> " Oh , Kat . You 're adorable , sweetie . " <p> And then they skipped off to enjoy their shopping and Botox , leaving Kat to mull over a half-eaten Cobb salad . <p> Kat drank the rest of the beer , set the bottle on the floor , and considered her predicament . I do n't care to be in the scene , she thought . <p> A part of her did n't care if Houston society found out about her dirty little secret . Sometimes , at charity events , Kat would fight the urge to jump up and shout , " Do n't you &shy; people know that I 'm poor ! " <p> But she could n't do this . She had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth of her family name , the aloofness of all that wealth and entitlement alive . And why ? Because of the Foundation . The foundation her grandfather  --  Cullen Davis King  --  had named after himself , and the one that Kathleen carried the torch for to this day . <p> The King Foundation was Kathleen 's raison d'Otre , and not because she hosted the most powerful ticket of the year . But because deep down , despite the fact that Kathleen had been born with a silver spoon in her mouth , she had a heart of gold . <p> It was the most exclusive event of the year . It raised millions of dollars for the Pediatric Cancer Hospital . And it was hosted by Kathleen herself  --  the last remaining King in the prominent King family . <p> Using her last name like a weapon , Kathleen Connor King had single-handedly created the most famous fund-raising event in Texas . Each ticket cost ( gasp ! ) ten thousand dollars . A table cost one hundred thousand . There were fifty tables . And Kat managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that she suffered through society events and agreed to have her picture taken with the Guccis , HermFs , and Carolina Herreras . <p> It was the reason she was painting , this week . Her " jungle art " would fetch a few thousand dollars during the foundation 's annual auction . <p> Kat dipped her brush in the can of hot pink boudoir paint and swirled it around the canvas , making the shape of a tree . She was painting a hot pink forest , in fact . Complete with hot pink birds and hot pink monkeys . <p> She scratched a fleck of dried paint from the tip of her thumb and wondered when Dylan would get home . She was feeling the feeling . Or , as her mother would 've said , " hot between the thighs . " <p> <br> Continues ...
