Section : Issues and Events Preserving starlit nights in the face of ever-growing light use is a balancing act that proponents of dark skies approach with education , better light fixtures , and legislation . <p> When an earthquake knocked out the power in Los Angeles in 1994 , people were puzzled by the starry sky . Ed Krupp , director of Griffith Observatory , recalls , " People saw something they 'd never seen before in an urban environment  --  or never in their lives . We got two or three dozen calls . They wanted to know , Did the earthquake cause it ? " <p> " The skies are very much a part of our intellectual survival . But people have lost touch with the sky , " says Krupp . It 's a loss felt across the industrialized world as light pollution has increasingly brightened the night sky . Already , for one-fifth of the world 's population  --  in the US , it 's more than two-thirds and in Europe , half  --  the Milky Way is no longer visible , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology Institute in Thiene and the University of Padua . Artificial sky glow comes from light that shines upward  --  from roadways and commercial , industrial , public , and residential properties . Streetlights and stars <p> Cinzano models light pollution . From satellite data , he determines the intensity of light sources on Earth and then computes how much light is scattered from particles in the atmosphere , taking into account the distributions of gases , aerosols , temperature , and other factors . For projections , he assumes light use will continue to grow at its present rate . By 2025 , for instance , he calculates that fewer than 100 stars will be visible in most of Italy 's population centers ( red or farther down the scale in the figure below ) . His projections for the whole of Europe and for the US likewise show increasing light pollution . " The night sky is very endangered , " he says . <p> " Usually people think that light pollution is a problem only for astronomers , but this is not true , " says Cinzano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public 's diminished view of the night sky , animals from fireflies to frogs to migrating birds , and human health  --  recent studies show increased rates of cancer when circadian rhythms are disrupted by too much light at night . " In 10 years we will have more biologists and medics at our meetings than astronomers , " predicts Malcolm Smith , president of the International Astronomical Union 's commission for the protection of existing and potential observatory sites . For now , though , he says , " astronomy acts as a canary in the mine for the rest of humanity . " <p> Ground-based telescopes ca n't beat light pollution . Astronomers can avoid it by observing in the infrared instead of the visible spectrum , or they can partially compensate with a larger telescope , but , as Bob Brucato , former assistant director of Palomar Observatory , puts it , " there is no filtering in principle . Photons are the same whether they come from a star or a streetlight . " Adds Chris Luginbuhl , an astronomer at the US Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 50 or 70 years , astronomers have gone to more and more remote areas  --  to remote mountaintops and remote countries . There are no further places to run . " <p> Given that dark skies are the bread and butter of astronomy , it 's perhaps surprising how few astronomers actively fight for them . Astronomers account for only a few percent of the nearly 11000 members of the International Dark-Sky Association ( IDA ) , a group that seeks to raise awareness about , and find solutions to , light pollution . The astronomers who still observe from polluted areas are " preoccupied with how it affects their observatories , " says Cinzano , but most go to " privileged dark skies and think , wrongly , that they are untouched by the problem . " Adds Smith , " Imagine a 25-year-old astronomer hearing about opportunities to work on light pollution and the acceleration of the universe . It 's not hard to guess what most people will choose . " Fragmented fight <p> For the most part , the battle against light pollution takes place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , McDonald Observatory has teamed up with the Nature Conservancy to buy nearby land and resell it with restrictions on lighting . Northern Italy has some of the toughest laws for preserving starlit skies . And in April the UK parliament passed a law declaring exterior floodlighting a " statutory nuisance . " <p> " There are hundreds , if not thousands , of light pollution ordinances nationwide , " notes IDA cofounder Dave Crawford , an astronomer based in Tucson , Arizona . Typically , they limit upward-shining light , overlighting , and light trespass  --  the shining of light onto neighboring property . Near some observatories , laws call for low-pressure sodium lights , whose emissions in the 589 nm doublet astronomers can work around . <p> IDA is drafting a model lighting ordinance to be tailored by communities for their specific needs . The MLO is supposed to be unveiled later this year . Says Nancy Clanton , a lighting designer and member of the drafting team , " We want to piggyback on the green-building movement , which is exploding . " Slow and nasty <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curbing light pollution in areas where there 's a clear environmental threat  --  such as to sea turtles on the Florida coast  --  or where astronomy is a boon for the economy . In Chile , " astronomy is a billion-dollar-a-decade industry , " says Smith . When he moved to that country in 1993 to head the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory , the light pollution had , he says , " increased substantially " since a previous stay in the early 1970s . " On the horizon , you could see the faint glow of La Serena , 60 kilometers away . That was an early warning . " Now , thanks to a 1999 ordinance , by this October all street lights in three northern regions of the country must comply with restrictions on upward-shining light . " If the legislation is effective , it will increase the lifetime of telescopes in Chile by more than 20 years , " Smith says . <p> The Big Island of Hawaii , home to the 10-m Keck telescopes and  --  like northern Chile  --  a candidate to host a future larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pollution , says Richard Wainscoat , a University of Hawaii astronomer . Still , he says , " we are right on the edge of light pollution affecting us . I 'm worried about the future . It 's a very slow , nasty increase . Better shielding and better regulation of noncompliant lighting are needed to cut down on per capita light pollution . That would allow for many years of population growth on the island while still preserving the dark night sky for astronomy . " <p> Ordinances are one thing , enforcing them is another . " It 's like keeping Jell-O down ; stuff pops up all over , " says Crawford . In southern Arizona , for example , where astronomy brings hundreds of millions of dollars into the state annually and the skies are widely considered a natural resource and tourist attraction , the billboard industry has for years fought to win exemptions from local outdoor lighting codes . <p> " The gutting of lighting codes could be devastating , " says Buell Jannuzi , deputy director of Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people why it 's important to regulate lighting . Most people understand that light going up into the sky is not making you more safe . " And by not sending light up , he adds , " you save energy and money in the long run . The irony is that it 's a win-win situation . " <p> Indeed , a few years ago , IDA estimated that the US was spending $1-2 billion annually on wasted light . In Chile , new shielded fixtures will save the town of Monte Patria about $1.3 million over a decade , Smith says . By shielding , " you can usually end up with about the same amount of light on the ground for about half the cost , " adds Bill Wren , a dark skies consultant . " In another energy crisis or two , the light pollution problem could solve itself . " <p> The sky above Wupatki National Monument in Arizona was recorded as part of a US National Park Service initiative to preserve dark skies . The bright spots in the south are the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter because it 's closer-Flagstaff ( 50 km ) . The diagonal swath is the Milky Way ; the wispy features around the edges are from natural airglow . This baseline image is a montage of more than 100 digital exposures . <p> Calculations based on satellite data show past light pollution in Italy and its projected growth if laws protecting dark skies go unenforced . The colors show the contributions of artificial light to the brightness of the night sky , from roughly 10-35% ( blue ) to 9-27 times ( red ) to 80 times ( white ) the natural brightness .
