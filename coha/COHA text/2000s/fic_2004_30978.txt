Hey , L. ! Mr. Hendricks wants to see you ! " Such a summons would have terrified Luke Garner only a few months earlier . When he 'd first come to Hendricks School for Boys , the thought of having to talk to any grown-up , let alone the headmaster , would have turned him into a stammering , quaking fool desperately longing for a place to hide . But that was back in April , and this was August . A lot had happened between April and August . Now Luke just waved off the rising tide of " ooh 's " from his friends in math class . " What 'd you do , L. ? Have you been sneaking out to the woods again ? " his friend John taunted him . " Settle down , class , " the teacher , Mr. Rees , said mildly . " You may be excused , Mr. , uh , Mr .... " Luke did n't wait for Mr. Rees to try to remember his name . Names were slippery things at Hendricks School anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different name from what he had grown up with . So it was always hard to know what to call people . Luke edged his way past his classmates ' desks and slipped out the door . His friend Trey , who had delivered the message from Mr. Hendricks , was waiting for him . " What 's this about ? " Luke asked as the two fell into step together , walking down the hall . " I do n't know . I just do what he tells me , " Trey said with a dispirited shrug . Sometimes Luke wanted to take Trey by the shoulders , shake him , and yell , " Think for yourself ! Open your eyes ! Live a little ! " Twelve years of hiding in a tiny room had turned Trey into a human turtle , always ready to pull back into his shell at the slightest hint of danger . But Mr. Hendricks had taken aliking to Trey and was working with him privately . That was why Trey was running errands for him today . Trey looked furtively over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Do you suppose it 's  --  you know  --  time ? " Luke did n't have to ask what Trey meant . Sometimes it seemed like everyone at Hendricks School was just holding his breath , waiting . Waiting for a day when none of the boys would be illegal anymore , when they could all reclaim their rightful names , when they could go back to their rightful families without fear that the Population Police would catch them . But both Luke and Trey knew that that day would n't come easily . And Luke , at least , had promised to do everything he could to bring it about . His stomach churned . The fear he thought he 'd outgrown reached him at last . " Did he say ... did Mr. Hendricks say ... , " he stammered . What if Mr. Hendricks had a plan for Luke to help with ? What if that plan required more courage than Luke had ? Trey went back to looking down at the polished tile floor . " Mr. Hendricks did n't say anything except , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell him to come see me , ' " Trey said . " Oh , " Luke said . They reached the end of the hall , and Luke pushed open the heavy wood door to the outside . Trey winced , as he always did anytime he was exposed to sunshine , fresh air , or anything else outdoors . But Luke breathed in gratefully . Luke had spent his first twelve years on his family 's farm ; some of his fondest memories involved the feeling of warm dirt on his bare feet , sunshine on the back of his neck , a hoe in his hand  --  and his parents and brothers around him . But it did n't do to think much about his parents and brothers anymore . When he 'd accepted his fake identity , he 'd had to leave them and the farm behind . And even when he 'd been with them , he 'd had to live like a shadow or a ghost , something no one else outside the family knew about . Once when his middle brother , Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentioned Luke 's name at school . " I had to tell the teacher that Mark just had an imaginary friend named Luke , " Luke 's mother had told him . " But I worried about that for months afterward . I was so scared the teacher would report you , and the Population Police would come and take you away . I 'm just glad that a lot of little kids do have imaginary friends . " She 'd bitten her lip telling Luke that story . Luke could still see the strained expression on her face . She had n't even told him about that episode until the day before he left the farm and his family for good . By then she 'd meant the story as assurance , he knew  --  assurance that he was doing the right thing by leaving . At the time , Luke had n't known what to make of that story . It just added to the jumble of confused thoughts and fears in his head . But now  --  now that story made him angry . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't fair that his brother could n't talk about him . It was n't fair that the Government had made him illegal simply because he was a third child and the Government thought families should have no more than two . Luke stepped out into the sunshine feeling strangely happy to be so angry . It felt good to be so sure about what he thought , so totally convinced that he was right and the Government was wrong . And if Mr. Hendricks really did have a plan for Luke , it 'd be good to hang on to this righteous anger . The two boys climbed down an imposing number of marble steps . Luke noticed that Trey glanced back longingly at the school more than once . Not Luke . Hendricks had no windows  --  to accommodate the fears of kids like Trey  --  and Luke always felt slightly caged anytime he was inside . They walked on down the lane to a house half hidden in bushes . Mr. Hendricks was waiting for them at the door . " Come on in , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on back to school and see about learning something for once . " That was a joke  --  Trey had done nothing but read while he 'd been in hiding , so he knew as much about some subjects as the teachers did . Luke opened the door , and Mr. Hendricks rolled back in his wheelchair to give Luke room to pass . When he 'd first met Mr. Hendricks , Luke had been awkward around him , particularly because of the wheelchair . But now Luke practically forgot that Mr. Hendricks 's lower legs were missing . Going into the living room , Luke automatically stepped out of the way of Mr. Hendricks 's wheels . " The other boys will find this out soon enough , " Mr. Hendricks said . " But I wanted to tell you first , to give you time to adjust . " " Adjust to what ? " Luke asked , sitting down on a couch . " Having your brother here at school with you . " " My brother ? " Luke repeated . " You mean Matthew or Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wild older brothers in their faded jeans and flannel shirts walking up the marble stairs at Hendricks . If he felt caged at the windowless school , his brothers would feel handcuffed , pinned down , thoroughly imprisoned . And how could Mother and Dad possibly afford to send them here ? Why would they want to ? " No , Lee , " Mr. Hendricks said , stressing the fake name that Luke had adopted when he 'd come out of hiding . Luke knew that he should be grateful that the parents of a boy named Lee Grant had donated his name and identity after the real Lee died in a skiing accident . The Grants were Barons  --  really rich people  --  so Luke 's new identity was an impressive one indeed . But Luke did n't like to be called Lee , did n't like even to be reminded that he was supposed to be somebody else . Mr. Hendricks was peering straight at Luke , waiting for Luke to catch on . " I said your brother , " Mr. Hendricks repeated . " Smithfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming here tomorrow . "
