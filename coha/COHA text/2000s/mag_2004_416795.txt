With resorts expanding their boundaries and opening ever-steeper terrain , avalanche control is as integral to the modern epic ski day as 30 inches of four-percent fluff . So why are avalanche controllers worried that their programs are in danger of being dismantled ? Two words : Homeland Security . For years , U.S. avalanche programs hummed along , using Howitzers , recoilless rifles , and Civil War-era cap-and-fuse hand-charge technology , with little government supervision . But a decade-long series of events has changed the way the feds , insurance companies , and bomb makers look at the process of blasting ski runs . It started with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombings . A year later , a patroller at Big Sky Resort , Montana , was killed when a hand charge detonated in her lap . ( Her training had consisted of a one-day explosives course . ) Then , in ' ' 98 , a deranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tahoe City street corner with munitions he 'd allegedly stolen from the ski area . Finally , along came September 11 and the Department of Homeland Security . So it 's no surprise that ski resorts have come under examination that some fear could lead to an overhaul of avalanche control . " Some manufacturers are getting less comfortable selling to ski-area operations , " says Crested Butte patrol director Woody Sherwood . " They think we 're a bunch of Marlboro-smoking cowboys throwing bombs . " In fact , after the Big Sky incident , Ensign-Bickford quit supplying munitions to ski areas . For those still involved , what matters is injury preventionand keeping deadly weapons away from any nut-job who wants to make a statement . Sounds easy , until you consider a federally conducted audit , released in early ' ' 03 , that revealed the U.S. Forest Service , which oversees ski-area avy control on public lands , did n't know where several of its 319 explosives bunkers were located . ( The USFS responded by bolstering its bomb-tracking system . ) To start tightening control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonresident aliens from handling explosives and requires stricter background checks . But the measure did n't stop a raid on the bomb cache at Winter Park Resort , Colorado , last March , where someone stole several hand charges ( one charge is roughly equal to two sticks of dynamite ) . To experts , the incident proved that security will remain an issue . Says Ed Ryberg , USFS ski area program coordinator : " Anyone can find out where that stuff is . " But do n't go pawning your fat skis and resigning yourself to the groomers ; avalanche control is unlikely to go away any time soon . " It 's not like we have an ax over our heads , " says Doug Abromeit , director of the forest service 's National Avalanche Center . " But all this scrutiny is going to make everyone stay on his game even more . " Nonetheless , Crested Butte 's Sherwood , and avy experts across the U.S. , are nervous . " It 's a whole new world since 9/11 , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if we have another problem , we could be in trouble .
