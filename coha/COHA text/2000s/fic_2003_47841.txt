Twenty years have passed since we last published a story by Mr. Reaves , so a few biographical notes about this author certainly seem to be in order . Michael Reaves began publishing short fiction in the 1970s , with the majority of his short stories appearing here ( remember " Werewind " ! ) . His first novel was published in 1978 and sixteen more have seen print since then , including The Shattered World and Voodoo Child . His next novel , Armageddon Blues , is due out in 2004 . He also has extensive screenwriting credits , including an Emmy award for his work on Batman : The Animated Series . His most recent publication is an anthology he and John Pelan coedited , Shadows Over Baker Street , which crosses Sherlock Holmes with H. P. Lovecraft 's cosmos . Mr. Reaves lives in Los Angeles . Born in 1950 , he fits in squarely with the Baby Boomers and he observes their nature acutely in this new tale . <p> YOU 'VE HEARD THE STORIES , I 'm sure , if you 're into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all leveled out and hooked up , I 'm going out on a limb and assuming you are . Nice rig , by the way . Now that our generation 's getting grayer , people are starting to realize that owning one of these does n't automatically make you a hardline Republican or a blue-haired Fundamentalist . It 's like golf - not just for boring people anymore . Look at those stars . Beautiful , huh ? That 's Aldebaran . And Sirius. . . ca n't see those in the city . Kids grow up there , never even know the stars exist . Anyway , most people think the Midnight Cruiser is just another urban legend . A modern-day Plying Dutchman . So did I , at first . I wish I still did . Johnny Stillwell , Corinne Hattick , and I all grew up together . All of us born within three years of each other , around 1950 . Card-carrying baby boomers . We first met in high school ; I think it was at a party , but it 's kinda hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whacked a lot back then , it being the sixties and all . I think I walked into a bedroom and surprised them on top of a pile of coats , but since I was so blitzed I probably could have fallen and missed the floor , it 's hard to be certain . It seems like we had always been friends . And it seems like Johnny and Cor had always been a couple . And it seems that , from the start , I had been in love with Cor . I know I was n't the first schmuck in history to fall for his best friend 's girl . That did n't make it hurt any less , though . I used to hope it would go away , hoped I 'd get used to seeing them together , so free and easy with each other , his arm over her shoulders , hers around his waist ... but I never did . I just became resigned to the hurt after a while , like my dad and his arthritis . You do n't get numb ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been easier if I could 've hated Johnny for having her . But I could n't . I resented it , and felt sorry as hell for myself , but Johnny was just too nice a guy , and too good a friend , to hate . Besides , he was better at just about everything else than I was - classes , track , popularity - so why should n't he be better at love than me ? I know , I know . Sounds like one of those old black-and-white B movies , does n't it ? Brief Encounter maybe , or It Happened One Night . They were way before your time . But if I was to cast it , I 'd say Clark Gable as Johnny , and Cor would be played by Barbara Stanwyck maybe , or Katharine Hepburn . And me - well , I 'd like to say Jimmy Stewart , or even Henry Fonda , but to be honest , it 'd be more like Ralph Bellamy or Dan Duryea . Look " em up on the IMDb later , rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure , I had girlfriends . All through high school and college . Half of " em I do n't even remember now , and the ones I do all merge together . There was never anyone special . Meanwhile , Johnny and Cor just kept on trucking . They 'd break up every now and then , but never for too long , and I 'd always be glad when they got back together again , because they 'd both sob on my shoulder until they patched things up , and that was n't too easy to take , believe me . We all had four years of state university ; both Johnny and I majored in draft dodging until the lottery was instituted . That was another way in which he lucked out and I did n't . Do n't know if you know this , but during the final years of the Vietnam war , they started drafting boys based on a lottery . Really . Sounds like something out of a Shirley Jackson story , I know , but it 's the truth - our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on the luck of the draw , you got to stay at home and start a family or march off to be cannon fodder . Both Johnny and I 'd been born in 1951 . His number was 346 , which meant his chances of going were about the same as Bill Clinton 's . I was number 11 . Hell no , I did n't go . I was 4-F ; the classification everyone wanted , which meant medically unfit for service . Heart valve problem . Had an operation ten years later that took care of it , but at the time it kept me out of the draft . But that 's not the point . Johnny never even had to think twice about whether or not he was going - I ca n't tell you how many sleepless nights I spent worrying about it . It was that way once we got out of school , too . Things came easy to Johnny ; he just did n't worry about life . Most of us had these horrible existential crises of identity during those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 'm I gon na make a buck ? Johnny never seemed to worry , even though his BA was in Liberal Arts , which , back then , was another way of saying , " I want to spend the rest of my life wearing a paper hat and flipping burgers . " He just eased on into a good job , selling real estate , while I pinballed from one thing to another , never seeming to get anywhere . He and Cor got married , bought a house , raised a son . I did none of those things . In a lot of ways I just stayed stuck in the late sixties and early seventies , that stretch of time between the Summer of Love and Nixon 's resignation , post-rock and roll but pre-disco . My hair was shorter , but still down to my collar ; I quit patching my Levis , but never did graduate to Dockers . And I still know where to score the best grass , but it 's way too expensive for me now . What 's past is past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . What I wanted to tell you about happened five years ago . Does n't seem that long . Maybe it is n't - to them . Johnny and Cor had always been big on the outdoors . They were healthy , fit , they played tennis and racquetball . And they went backpacking , all over the place . They 'd drive fifty miles to some spot way the hell out past nowhere , park and walk another twenty miles before they 'd set up a tent and sleep . The next morning they 'd come back . It made no sense at all to me . I 'd say , " Why not just camp out in your back yard ? Think of all the gas and shoe leather you 'd save . " What can I say ? I 've never been a back-to-nature type - my idea of roughing it is when the maid forgets to leave the mints on the night table at the hotel . And as the two of them got older , I guess they started to feel a bit like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it in style . All I know is , one day I get a call from Johnny , telling me I have to come see their new toy . By now it 's 1997 , and we 're all on the far side of forty , with the big five-oh looming . A serious speed bump on the highway of life for me , but as usual , Johnny just sailed serenely on . He 'd taken his money from work and invested it , playing the market as good as he played everything else , and as a result , he was ready to retire . His kid was off in college - they 'd had Dusty right after graduating from State U - and he could afford to play now . They were n't rich , you understand - but they were doing well . Hell , I doubt it ever even occurred to him to have a mid-life crisis . Mine , on the other hand , started just after college and I do n't think it 's over yet . It 's been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be two hundred . I drove over to his house , wondering what it would be this time . The last time he 'd been this excited it had been the projection TV , with the Fujita line-doubler and the THX home theater sound system . They lived in Royal Oaks , not up on the ridge , but still a few blocks south of the Boulevard , in a nice two-story Colonial . I was real familiar with it . When Dusty was off at college and they 'd decide to go to Vegas or someplace , they 'd ask me to housesit for them . And I always did . Got to sit in the hot tub , swim in the pool , watch movies on the big screen TV ... and pretend , for just a little while , that it was me instead of him . I saw it as soon as I turned onto their street . It was n't hard to miss . They 'd bought a motorhome . I was n't really that surprised . After all , that 's the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden years . Not that they were anywhere near senior citizen material yet - Johnny still weighed about what he weighed in college , most of it muscle , and Cor - her hair was more ashes and less fire now , but she still had a figure that made my heart go pitty-pat . I , on the other hand , had put on twenty pounds , all around my middle-aged middle . Anyway , there it was : a thirty-five-foot Kenneka Road Trekker Supreme , brand new , judging by the paper license plate in the rear window , backed into their driveway and aimed at the great outdoors like a giant fun-seeking missile . I did n't know a lot about motorhomes then my education has progressed quite a bit since - but even then I could tell this was n't any milk carton on wheels . Kenneka makes a lot of the celebrity wagons Hollywood uses when the stars have to live on location , and even the most A-list of them would 've been happy with this . Johnny was inside it ; he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had been when my mom bought me a new Red Ryder wagon . " What do you think ? " he asked me . " It 's big , " I said . There was n't a lot else to say at that point . " Let me show it to you , " and he grabbed my arm and pulled me toward the door . It was damned impressive , even to an old hippie who still gave lip service to the environment . White on the outside , two-tone gray inside ; a Class A diesel pusher with dual 6V Coach batteries , ducted AC and heat , 100-gallon gas tank , LP and water , a 4KV generator and a full monocoque chassis . Johnny rattled off these and a whole lot of other statistics while he gave me the tour , and I smiled and nodded , not knowing what any of them meant . Not then . The interior was a marvel of compact engineering and ergonometry . It had oak finished cabinetry , pleated shades and mini-blinds , a closed-off bedroom and slide-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical toilet . The ceiling was studded with recessed lighting , stereo speakers and LP , CO and smoke detectors . It seemed far bigger on the inside than it looked from the outside ; it reminded me of one of those old cartoons where Daffy or Mickey or some other critter would push a button on a car , and it would magically unfold into a palatial estate on wheels . " You got yourself a TARDIS , " I told him . He laughed . Dr. Who had been one of our favorites back in college , especially when viewed through a haze of Jamaican Red . The living space opened into a cab with captain 's chairs and a dashboard that was straight out of Star Trek , studded with digital gauges , GPS , security camera monitor screens and a wideband radio . The chairs could turn 180degrees and from them you could watch the thirty-six-inch projection TV on a screen that lowered in front of the galley . It had a satellite dish and a CD player with 150kw of surround sound . It had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had a combination microwave/convection oven . It had " Enough , " I said , verging on overload . I sat down in one of the captain 's chairs . It was comfortable enough that you could drive from here to Tierra del Fuego and back without needing a break . Johnny stood next to the fridge and grinned at me . " We finally took your advice , " he said . " No more backpacking . From now on we travel in style . " By " we " I assumed he meant he and Cor , naturally . I tried to look on the bright side : this meant that I 'd probably be housesitting more for them , which meant less time spent in my shoebox apartment listening to the heavy metal Muzak of the pistonheads next door . That was a definite positive . " Congratulations , " I said , and I meant it . " Just promise me that if you get an uncontrollable urge to wear polyester , you 'll seek professional help . And do n't worry about your place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are friends for ? " Johnny gave me that look of his he always reserved for my especially lame statements . " We want you to come with us , Drake . Some of the time , anyway . " That one I did n't see coming , and I just stared at him . He looked mightily pleased with himself . " It 's not the biggest reason we bought this , of course , " he said . " But it was a factor . Cor 's idea , actually . You can sleep in the overhead , and we 've got the bedroom . Totally private , man . It 'll be fun . " Remember that Far Side cartoon about what dogs hear when we talk to them ? That was me right then . Out of everything he 'd just said , all I heard was one word : Cor . Her idea ? No way . She 'd never given any sign at all in over thirty years that she considered me anything but a friend , that she had any inkling of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told myself firmly . Rein it in , Romeo . There was no reason at all to read anything into this other than what Johnny 'd just said - it would be fun . After all , we 'd gone to dinners , movies , ball games , together ; I 'd even gone camping with them , reluctantly , once or twice . This was just a logical extension of those outings , in their eyes . Fun . Which we generally had , do n't get me wrong . It 's not like I was always in despair over the love that would never be mine , etc . Usually it was fun , and Cor and I were just what we were supposed to be - friends . Usually . But this , I knew , was different . This was somehow more - intimate . But what was I afraid of , after all ? I did n't think for a silver second that we might all wind up in bed together ; I most emphatically did n't want that , and neither did they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size and construction of this beast , the two of them could be going at it like sex-starved wolverines and I would n't hear a thing . Their bed and mine were practically in separate zip codes . Also , I had to admit that the idea of spending a few days in this ingenious little habitat on wheels was intriguing . About the only way you could get me to leave civilization for the wild would be to drag a piece of civilization along - which is just what they were proposing . And then , while I was bouncing between yes and no , I heard : " Say you will , Drake . It 'll be just like watching Wild Kingdom . You wo n't get a single mosquito bite . Promise . " I turned and saw Cor standing in the doorwell , arms folded , smiling at me . A smile that would make me gladly hike through the swamps of Mordor if she asked . " And besides , " she added , " if you do n't like it , we 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who could refuse an offer like that ? " Just one question , " I said . " Does it have a hot tub ? " I DID N'T GO with them every time they went out not even , as it turned out , most times . But enough . Enough to get some knowledge of the fascinating intricacies of the mobile world . From the full-time RV-ers who literally live on the road to those like Johnny and Cor , who were just dipping their toes in it , this was an entire subculture , with its own magazines , websites , chat boards , and more . I also learned by osmosis the care and feeding of the beast : How to set the wheel chocks , how to adjust the air leveling stabilizers to insure you 're parked flat , how to hook up water , electricity , and sewage in a campground , how to fill the propane tank , drain the black water , work the slideout and the awnings , manage the security and GPS systems . Even how to drive it , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . You get a real sense of superiority being able to see over ninety percent of the cars and trucks ahead of you . And there is nothing quite like parking on a bluff above a pastoral valley , watching the sunset while eating fresh-caught pan-fried trout and drinking Chardonnay , with Haagen-Dazs for dessert . As for the group dynamics : well , I did feel about as useful as a burst appendix most of the time , but it was n't any more painful to see them together in this setting than in any other . Like I said , after a while you get resigned to the pain . And that 's never a good idea . Because , just as nature abhors a vacuum , pain hates to be taken for granted . It was about nine o'clock one night , after another weekend of genteel roughing it , that we first encountered the cruiser . I was driving ; Cor was riding shotgun . Johnny was in the back asleep , tuckered out after a hard day of playing Mark Trail . We 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other campgrounds in favor of the back roads , dry camping wherever we found a level space . Now we were heading home , along a winding two-lane road that meandered through low hills and stands of trees . I was taking it slow , maybe forty-five , down to twenty on the curves . The Moon was peeking over the horizon , the stars were almost bright enough to read by , and we were the only people on the road - the only ones in the world , it felt like . I do n't remember what Cor and I were talking about . Something trivial , like music , or maybe movies . Something safe , just so that I could listen to her voice and look at her face . Then , after a moment of moonlit silence , she said , " Johnny and I may be splitting up . " Even counting the adrenalyzed reaction I would have to the nightmare just under five minutes in our future , I think right then was when I came closest to driving the wagon off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , when I could breathe again , I said , " What ? " She sighed , looking sad and completely unaware of the megatonnage she 'd just dropped on me . " With Dusty off at school , it's-we 're different . And he 's nor happy . He keeps saying he wants something , but he does n't know what it is . " I was astonished . I had thought that Johnny had somehow managed to escape the angst that lay in wait for all males over forty , the " Is that all there is ? " feeling , the panic that rises when you realize that you may have just passed the last off ramp to anything meaningful in your life . But maybe he had n't . Maybe he 'd just managed to put his off a little longer than most of us . " Is that why he wanted this ? " I asked , gesturing to encompass the Trekker . " I guess . Some men buy motorcycles or sports cars ... Johnny bought a rnotorhome . It has n't helped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asleep over twenty feet away behind a fanfold door . " He 's been such a pain in the ass I ca n't tell you , this past year . And these days he ca n't even .... " she arched her eyebrows meaningfully . " Whoa , " I said , " This is verging on overshare . I mean , I 'm sorry to hear this , Cor , but I ... uh .... " I stalled , because she was looking at me with such sadness . As if she wanted me to fix it , somehow , and I could n't , of course . And did I really want to ? That was the inevitable next thought . If they did break up , did that mean that the rules had all changed ? I felt like pond scum for thinking these thoughts . But I thought them . Then I went back and thought them again . The second time it was n't as hard , and that made me feel even worse . I looked at Cor , not sure what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went unsaid . Because she suddenly looked out the windshield and yelled , " Look out ! " I looked out . And slammed on the brakes . While we 'd been talking we had come out of the hills and onto a long , relatively straight stretch of blacktop . Unconsciously , I had speeded up to about fifty , because there was nobody ahead of us . I 'll repeat that : it was lonesome highway all the way from the front bumper to the swollen Moon that had just risen above the horizon . I could n't have missed seeing a toy car on the road , let alone a real one . And yet , right in front of us , so close that I could see the reflection of our cab in the chrome on the rear bumper , was another motorhome , trundling along at about half our speed . I 'd very nearly driven right up its tailpipe . Our tires squealed , and the speedometer readout dropped in a blur of numbers . I felt the shoulder strap dig in painfully across my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You okay ? " " Yeah . You ? " Her voice was shaky . " I 'm fine . Where the hell did he come from ? " I was pissed off - at this fool who 'd showed up out of nowhere and nearly gotten us killed , at Cor and Johnny for rocking the secure , if not happy , world I lived in , and at myself , for wanting my best friend to get divorced so that I could try to move in on his wife . The RV ahead of us was big , as large as the Road Trekker , if not larger . It was black with aluminum detailing , very sleek and streamlined , to judge from the back , which was all we could really see . It was moseying along at around thirty , in no hurry at all . It could n't possibly have passed me , and there were n't any side roads that I had seen . So how did it get in front of me ? The fear hit me then . I took a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound as I exhaled . My hands were gripping the steering wheel very tightly . I had no idea where this sudden panic attack was coming from ; I just knew that something was wrong here , something more than just that rig 's impossible appearance in front of us . Something felt wrong . The air , which had been cool just a minute ago , now seemed suddenly warm and humid , like a hothouse , and there was a strange , thick texture , almost a smell but not quite , to it that " What 's wrong ? " Johnny asked , and I nearly drove off the road again . He was standing behind us , still wearing the safari pants and pullover he 'd had on earlier today . " Great jumping Jesus ! " I said , and my voice was higher than it had been since I was ten . " I thought you were asleep . " " I was . Until you hit the brakes and I hit the wall . " He peered ahead . " What 's up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faltered , and Johnny looked at me with a slight frown , and I knew there was no way I could let myself fall apart now . " I do n't know . He came out of nowhere . " As I said it , I glanced at the speedometer and saw that he 'd slowed down to just over twenty , as had I. " Christ , Drake , you drive like an old man wearing a hat , " Johnny said . " Go on and pass him . " I hesitated , but not out of any conscious decision . My muscles simply locked . I tried to push my shoe against the pedal , but the message was n't getting through . I could n't say why then - ca n't really say why now - but I knew , somehow , that it just was n't a good idea . " What are you waiting for ? " Johnny seemed edgy , but not panicked like I was . " There 's no one coming . Pull out and go around the sonuvabitch . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real deep part of my brain , the cold and sleepy reptilian core that we 've coated over with layer after layer of reason and logic for millennia . That part does n't speak up too often , but when it does , you do n't want to ignore it . But fear of contempt , even unvoiced , from someone we admire can overcome almost any other concern , no matter how deep its roots go . I set my teeth to keep them from chattering and started turning the wheel slightly toward the left . It was like trying to steer a supertanker . And then Cor said , in an oddly flat voice , " Look at the license plate . " I looked . Johnny looked . We were close enough that the headlamps illuminated it clear as day . It was green , with the plate number in white . Underneath the number it read UTAH 67 . " That 's an old license plate , " I said . I think I said it . It sounded like someone else speaking . " Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brand new . So does the paint job . " " You know what ? " Johnny sounded almost excited . Whatever the nameless unease affecting Cor and me was , it was n't playing at all on his screen . " That 's a Motorstar Dynacruiser ! I recognize the style . They stopped making them in 1972 , I think . Someone 's done a great job of restoring it . " He nudged me in the shoulder . " Go on , Drake - pass it so we can take a look . " I remembered hearing some other RV enthusiast mention the Dynacruiser once . There were only a thousand or so made before the company went bankrupt . He 'd described it as " A Buck Rogers spaceship on wheels . " The sour taste of panic was beginning to fade now . Johnny 's explanation made sense , after all . This was an antique that someone had found , fixed up , and was now touring America in ; nothing more than that . I glanced at Cor , saw she was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us all along , and I 'd somehow missed seeing him until I was right on top of him . That particular affliction of the human male that women call " refrigerator blindness " - the inability to see something right in front of you . My chest relaxed enough for me to take a deep breath , and boy , did it feel good . " Okay , " I said . And swung out into the left lane to pass the Dynacruiser . I accelerated to fifty mph , and the Trekker began moving past it . I could still see the road ahead , and it was empty for at least a mile , which gave me plenty of room to pass , even if another car appeared on the horizon right then . As we drew up alongside the Dynacruiser , I spared a couple of quick glances at it . It had a sleek , almost Deco look that did made me think of old Flash Gordon serials . It was as aerodynamic as a bullet , and I wondered what the interior looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futuristic portholes , and made of thick glass that had been smoked almost black . I could n't see anything within , at first ; then I got the vague impression of movement in there , shadowy shapes flickering . At one point the palm of a hand , fingers spread , slapped against the window for a brief instant . It was gone almost before I realized what it was . We were now even with the Dynacruiser , and I could see the cab . Its windows were just as opaque as the others . I got only the vaguest impression of a silhouette behind the wheel . But something about it was enough to bring all the terror of a few moments ago slamming back into me ; I actually grunted from the impact . I 'm not sure I can tell you what was wrong with it . It looked incomplete , somehow . " What are you waiting for ? " Johnny said . " Get past him and back in your own lane . " I fed the engine some more diesel . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything , we were slowing down . I looked at the readout . According to it , we were past fifty-five , but every sense I had was telling me we were decelerating . The sounds of the engine , the tires against the road , the wind whistling past us , all were subdued , as if they were coming through a thick wall . I looked at Cor , and I could see she was feeling the same thing . It was that helpless sensation you have when mired in a nightmare , when you try to run but your feet are stuck , you 're trying to push through some kind of clear gel that drags you down . And you never get any closer to your goal , but you know all the time that something is getting closer and closer to you . Both the Trekker and the Dynacruiser seemed to be barely creeping now . The landscape still blurred past , but it blurred in slow motion , if that makes any sense . And it was getting increasingly hard to see ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the night sky had been perfectly clear a few minutes ago . Gray fog thickened and streamed around both our rigs , its ragged tendrils somehow filmy - they stuck momentarily to the windshield before trailing by , leaving slimy , silvery streaks like snail tracks . Visibility had gone from ten miles to less than ten feet . The fog threw back the headlights " beams , and the reflected light was - dirty . I do n't know how else to describe it . I knew I had to do something . Even though every nerve in my body was telling me we were crawling down that highway , the speedometer was now telling me sixty mph . There could be an eighteen wheeler thundering toward us through the fog right now , and we would n't know it until just before it smashed us flatter than a steamrollered cat . I looked across the cab again . Cor was watching me , her face very white and scared . Johnny was saying something , but I could n't hear him . All I could hear , bizarrely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head : the Stones singing " Midnight Rambler . " I looked out the window at the Dynacruiser . That silhouette was still there in the cab , behind the smoked glass , and the sight of it still made my guts feel packed in ice . But it was changing somehow , growing less reflective . Then I realized what was happening . The driver was rolling his window down . In another second it would be lowered completely , and then he could lean out into the dead moonlight and look at me . My memory of what happened next is pretty chaotic . I do , however , remember yanking the wheel hard to the right , sending the Trekker on a collision course with the Dynacruiser . I remember Cor 's horrified scream , and Johnny trying , too late , to grab the wheel . And I remember the flood of relief I felt knowing that we would hit before I could see the driver 's face . The next thing I knew , the Trekker was on the right shoulder , half off the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had come . The Moon was halfway to zenith , and the sky was full of stars . There was not a wisp of fog . And there was no sign of the Dynacruiser - or any other vehicle anywhere to be seen . JUST AFTER DAWN we stopped at a gas station that advertised diesel . There was a store there - not a mini-mart , but a small mom-and-pop place , built from planked wood and looking like it had been on this planet since before my folks had been born . The pumps were the old-fashioned kind , with a hand-crank to reset the cost , and there was someone who actually put the nozzle in the tank for you , squeegeed your windshield , and even asked how life was treating you . None of us felt like telling him right then . I went inside to buy something - I did n't care what it was , I just needed to spend a little money . It seemed like it would help . If I did enough normal , everyday things , maybe eventually it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't very optimistic , but it was worth a try . The old man behind the counter - skinny , gray beard , John Deere cap - took my money for the small bottle of orange juice , gave me change , then looked at my face and said , " You do n't look too good , mister . " I mumbled something about low blood sugar as I uncapped the orange juice . He said , " You look like you just saw the Midnight Cruiser . " By the time he 'd fetched a mop and helped me clean up the juice and the broken glass , Johnny and Cor had come in to see what was taking me so long . Then the four of us - Johnny , Cor , me and the old man - sat outside on a bench , drinking sodas - or in my case , a beer - that he provided for free and watching the mist burn off the treetops as the Sun rose and he told us the story . His son , the pump-jockey , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the tale a few times before . There are n't many urban legends specific to RV-ers ; the one that most people are familiar with is the story about the fellow who set the Cruise Control and then , thinking it meant " Automatic Pilot , " left the wheel with his rig going down the highway at sixty mph and totalled it . That one actually happened , though most folks think it 's a fable . Just like most folks think the story of the Midnight Cruiser is n't anything more than a modern campfire tale . Except for the ones who 've seen it . Happened back in the early seventies , the store owner told us , about a hundred and fifty miles from there , near the Indian rez . Someone had been boondocking on sacred ground , so the story went , and as a result had been damned to forever roam the highways . That was one version , anyway . Other tellings had the Dynacruiser 's owner trying to renege on a pact with Satan , or being cursed by a corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gallon . One particularly bizarre account was given about him being a marijuana-crazed Rastafarian dope dealer who was into some kind of voodoo black magic that backfired . The Midnight Cruiser , it seemed , had more origin stories than a truckload of comic books . But where he came from did n't matter as much as what he did . All the stories were consistent on this part : He collected people . Why he did it , what his criteria for selection were , was never clear . But apparently there were few indeed who saw the Midnight Cruiser and escaped to tell the tale . Like we had . I remembered the shapes I 'd seen moving in the deep darkness behind those windows , the pale hand splayed for an instant against the glass . I had another beer . It did n't help . There was no way we could make it back to the city before nightfall , not even if we broke every speed law in the book . We decided that the best plan was to drive until sundown , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight and hole up there . We could reach home the following day easily . We did n't talk too much about what had happened . After learning about the legend , there was sort of an unvoiced mutual decision to stay away from the topic . At least , that 's the way it was between Cor and me . Johnny tried to approach it once or twice , mostly to rationalize it somehow , to find an explanation that fit the world as he knew it . But the look on Cor 's face stopped that pretty quick . That night we stayed in a state roadside rest area with three other mobiles , who were probably fairly nonplussed at the way we fortified ourselves . We kept all the outside lights burning , the alarm and security cameras operating , the whole rig sealed up like a bunker . Even so , none of us even tried to sleep that night . We stayed up and watched movies . Comedies . No one laughed , but at least we all got through the night sane . We made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week I stayed in their guest room , before I could handle being by myself . For the next three months , I slept with every light in my place on . When I was able to sleep at all . Cor only spoke to me about that night , or about how things were between her and Johnny , one more time , just before they took that last ride . I could see , though , that their marriage was disintegrating fast . I told them both that if they needed to talk , I was there . Neither one called me . They sold the Trekker , of course , immediately . Johnny got less than half the book value of it , just to get it out of the driveway . It was nearly a month after the trip when I called and got Cor on the line . My previous calls had just landed in voice mail and not been returned . But this time she picked up when she heard my voice . She did n't seem particularly surprised that it was me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine , " which was probably the biggest lie anyone 's told since Judas Iscariot , but I had n't really expected more . Then I asked her how things were between Johnny and her . " We have separate bedrooms , " she said , and her voice was very weary . " Separate bank accounts , now . " She sighed . " Separate lives . " There was a moment of silence ; then she said , " He - he talks about it . More and more . I 've told him I do n't want to hear it , but . . . . " " Talks about it how ? " I asked , when she did n't continue . " To him , it was ... something else ... than it was to you and me . I think that , to him , it was ... the last big thing . Do you understand ? " I said I thought I did . " I think he 's going to do something , " she said . Something in her tone chilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get out of there , Cor , " I told her . " You could - stay here for a while . I think maybe you should n't be around Johnny these days . " She was quiet for so long that I thought we 'd lost the connection . Then she said , very softly , " I 'm sorry , Drake . " And hung up . I did n't go over there . I should have . I wish to God I had . I should have jumped in the car and gone and taken her out of there . I did n't . The next morning they were gone . The neighbors could n't tell me much . It seems that all that night the street was blanketed in a thick fog , which is almost unheard-of this time of year . The couple next door said they heard an engine idling for a short time after midnight , and mentioned that the air smelled like bus exhaust . There was no sign of a struggle , no evidence of foul play . They had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale . And that 's all I know . You want to know why I 'm here ? Why I 'm on the road after dark , in this dinky little cab-over camper , knowing what I know is out there ? I 'll tell you . I think I know who the Midnight Cruiser is . Or what he is . I do n't think he 's a sorcerer , or that he 's on the Devil 's shit list , or anything like that . I think he is - was - a guy . Just a normal guy , who worked his whole life , who did everything right , who chased after the American Dream until he caught it . Or thought he did . I think he bought that Dynacruiser and he - and the missus , too , maybe - hit the road , traveled the blue highways , because that 's what you do . That 's one way you deal with that terror that grips you at all hours , that fear that your life is running dry . Remember the legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing around the Cape of Good Hope , ran into a storm , was driven onto the rocks , and started to sink . The Captain swore that he would make it around the Cape if it took him until Doomsday . So that 's what he was condemned to do : spend eternity trying to round the Cape . God takes these things very literally sometimes . I think the Cruiser made the same mistake . I think he wanted that dream so badly he was willing to spend eternity looking for it . I think Johnny was the same way . I think that wagon is full of people chasing a dream that never was . And now Johnny 's one of them . But why Cor went with him - that I do n't know . Maybe someday I 'll find out . Or maybe this is just my dream to chase .
