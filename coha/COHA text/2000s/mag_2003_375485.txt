The latest step in the Canadian drug war may just be surrender . National health officials last week approved the first legal " safe injection site " in North America . Heroin and cocaine users at the future facility in Vancouver 's drug-riddled Downtown Eastside neighborhood , will be able to shoot up under the watchful eye of a nurse and then relax in a " chill-out room " without any interference from police . A Bush Administration official ripped the initiative as " state-sponsored suicide . " But Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell , an ex  --  drug squad cop who championed the injection site , shoots back : " I think all you have to do is take a look at your prison system and your law enforcement to see if the drug war is being won in the States . It 's an unmitigated disaster and they know it , but they ca n't back out of it . " <P> The program aims to reduce overdoses and intravenously transmitted viruses . ( About 30% of addicts in the area are HIV positive ; 90% have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus a waiting room . Program administrators estimate that 850 injections will take place each day . <P> They hope that visitors will also utilize in-house counseling services , although they say as few as 2% of clients may seek treatment . " It may not sound like much , " says Laurie Dawkins , a spokeswoman for the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority , " but it 's better than none . "  --  By Kate Novack
