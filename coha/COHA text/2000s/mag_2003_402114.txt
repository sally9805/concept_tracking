John Elder Gallery , New York , NY February 4-March 1 , 2003 If Wendell Castle , Peter Pierobon 's former teacher , can be said to share some traits of postmodernism with the architect Michael Graves ( such as clever transformations of historical forms and the pursuit of centralized , serene compositions ) , his student , in work done long after leaving Castle 's studio , has found his oeuvre headed in the direction of deconstruction . In architecture , deconstruction has been a reaction against the quirky , historicized centrality of postmodernism , embracing unruly , innovative compositions and ambiguous texts in an attempt to better reflect the complexities of the present era . Pierobon 's deconstruction incorporates implied motion , apparent instability and the vestiges of text . It reflects on our uneasy times , evoking the sublime by admitting disturbance into the domestic interior . Calligraphy has long been associated with Pierobon 's work-lettering or musical notation inscribed upon his pieces or expressed in three-dimensional forms . But in his latest work , it is as if the text has been washed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in a system of simplified , multidirectional forms that seem to have been thrown about by an invisible sea , sometimes carrying the flotsam of another element , such as a sapele desktop , which floats like a hatbox upon a wave . The abstract shapes evoke different associations , from leaping fish to piles of driftwood , all embodying motion and instability . These elements possess the sleekness of seals , their mute surfaces polished as if by the ocean . Similar to the effect of water over time , the concentrated action of the maker configures raw materials into dynamic compositions and finishes them to a perfectly smooth blackness . Pierobon 's craftsmanship is impeccable . Complex junctures do the near impossible . The mysterious , seemingly tenuous connections between parts are the key to the sense of action in the work . All the pieces in the show ( candelabra , desks , coffee tables ) , except for the " pipe " chairs , reside in a world that the laws of gravity should disallow . Only in conjunction with one another do their components find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held intension like a photograph of something in motion . More lyrical are the pair of pipe chairs that appear to hover amid the hubbub of active forms-more of each chair is off the floor than resting on it . These tapered , arching figures seem to have roots in Surrealism-one recalls Magritte 's painting , Cecin'est pas un pipe , an early semiotic work that elucidates the tendency to confuse real objects with their representation.The Surrealists often imbued commonplace objects with psychological content , and Pierobon 's elegant pipe forms have a similar character . They are sensuous-erotic , even-and their giant scale alters their relation to human use , transforming them into ritualistic objects . This is the power of Peter Pierobon 's current effort . In functional furniture enriched and enlivened by symbolic content , he has employed sculptural forms to create a mood , embracing human vulnerability within a sublime interior landscape .
