The sun was shining on the red and yellow tulips along Mrs. Grumbly 's front walk . But Mrs. Grumbly did n't notice the tulips . She came out of her little white cottage with the blue shutters , sniffed the lilac fragrance , and sneezed . " Pollen , " she grumbled . She walked down her front walk , seeing only the weeds coming up between the tulips . " Weeds , weeds , " she complained as she pulled them from the ground . A boy and a girl came skipping by . " Good morning , Mrs. Grumbly , " they called as they passed Mrs. Grumbly 's picket fence . " Good morning , indeed , " muttered Mrs. Grumbly . " Do n't you pick my flowers now . " " Oh , no-we wo n't ! " the boy said . " They 're pretty flowers , " said the girl . // She sniffed the lilacs as she passed . Then the children skipped off on their way to school . " Humph ! " Mrs. Grumbly bent to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good morning , Mrs. Grumbly . " Mrs. Grumbly looked up . At her front gate stood the oddest little man , scarcely taller than the children who had skipped by . He wore a green and yellow jacket and a pointed green hat . " What do you want ? " Mrs. Grumbly demanded . She was sure she had never seen this strange person before . " How do you know my name ? " " I know everyone 's name , " the little man said , opening the gate . He came up the walk and set down a large green bag . " I want to give you something . " Mrs. Grumbly looked at the bag . " Are you a peddlar ? I do n't want anything . " The little man opened his bag and took out a small box . " In this box , I have something you need . " " Humph ! " But what could he have in that little box ? Mrs. Grumbly wondered . She came a step closer and leaned forward for a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . Inside , lay a small pair of spectacles with gold frames and rose-colored lenses . " Just a pair of eyeglasses ! " Mrs. Grumbly said . " Is that all ? " " Magic glasses , they are , Mrs. Grumbly , " said the man in the green hat . " Very special , indeed . The whole world looks different when you wear them . " Mrs. Grumbly hesitated . " Well , I might just try them on , I suppose . " " Here , let me help you . " He slid the glasses on her nose . As Mrs. Grumbly looked through the glasses , a strange thing happened . The sun shone more brightly . The red tulips looked redder , and the lilacs gave off a sweeter fragrance . " Why , they do make things look different ! " exclaimed Mrs. Grumbly . The little man smiled . " How much do you want for them ? " she asked . " Oh , they 're not for sale , " the little man said . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ? " asked Mrs. Grumbly . " Only a week , " the little man nodded . " One week from today , I will come back for them . " " A week 's not very long , " grumbled Mrs. Grumbly . Before she could say another word , the little man skipped down the walk and through the front gate . " Goodness , what a peculiar little man , " Mrs. Grumbly said to herself . " But generous . " She peered through the magic glasses as she walked through her garden . " My , how lovely the tulips look today ! " She sniffed the lilacs . " How sweet the lilacs smell ! " She sighed . " What a beautiful , beautiful day it is . " Every day Mrs. Grumbly wore the magic glasses . And each day seemed more beautiful than the one before . // Mrs. Grumbly even sang as she worked in her garden . She smiled at the people who passed by . She was especially cheerful when the schoolchildren came to her gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would n't you like to pick some flowers to take to your teacher ? " " We sure would , " said the girl . She stopped and picked two yellow tulips and a red . " Thank you , Mrs. Grumbly . Thank you for the pretty flowers . " Mrs. Grumbly noticed that people who used to pass by without speaking began to stop to talk to her over her garden fence . What a pleasure it is to chat with friendly folks , thought Mrs. Grumbly . I 'd rather forgotten , it has been so long . Mrs. Grumbly was working in her garden when the little man in the green hat suddenly appeared at her gate . " Good morning , Mrs. Grumbly ! " He opened the gate and skipped up the walk . " I 've come for the magic glasses . " " Oh , no ! " protested Mrs. Grumbly . " Please do n't take them ! " She put her hands up to hold onto the glasses . " I must take them , " said the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as you did . " " But they are such wonderful glasses , " said Mrs. Grumbly . She snatched the spectacles and held them behind her back . " They make the whole world look different . " He held out his hand . " But I do n't want everything to look like it did before ! " Mrs. Grumbly said . " I do n't want to feel cross and grumpy and lonely again . " // " You do n't have to , " said the man . " The magic glasses have opened your eyes and your heart to the beauty everywhere around you . " " But how can I see it without the glasses ? " asked Mrs. Grumbly . " If you want to see it , you can . Just look , Mrs. Grumbly . You 're not wearing the glasses now . " Mrs. Grumbly looked around . Sunlight still lit up the red and yellow tulips . She sniffed . The gentle breeze still carried the sweet fragrance of lilacs . " Why , I do still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing the magic glasses , " she said . She took them off and held out her hand . The little man carefully settled the glasses into their box . " You can always see beauty in the world-if you try . " Mrs. Grumbly felt a warmness inside her heart . " Thank you , kind sir , for letting me wear the wonderful rose-colored glasses . " The little man put the box into his big green bag . " I 'm glad you enjoyed them , " he said as he turned to leave . " Never forget to look for the beauty in life . " " I wo n't , " Mrs. Grumbly promised . She picked up a tulip and sniffed it . " What a wonderful man . " // <p>
