Study nature , not books ! " advised the great 19th century naturalist Louis Agassiz . As a boy growing up in Alabama and northern Florida , Edward Osborne Wilson did both . By day he scoured fields , forests and streams . At night he pored over books and magazines . It was an article in National Geographic ( " Stalking Ants , Savage and Civilized " ) that launched , at the ripe age of 9 , one of the great scientific careers of the late 20th century , a career that began in entomology  --  with a particular passion for ants  --  but that has since reinvented itself with remarkable frequency , expanding its scope to encompass not just the earth 's smallest creatures but the whole living planet . <P> E.O . Wilson 's scientific contributions began early . He was 13 when he discovered , in a vacant lot near the docks of Mobile , Ala. , the first known U.S. colonies of fire ants , Solenopsis invicta , invaders from Brazil and Argentina known in the South as " the ants from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late 1950s , he proposed the radical notion that ant societies are bound together by an elaborate system of chemical signals . He went on to prove the existence of what are now called pheromones with an elegant experiment . Pied Piper-like , he lured a stream of worker ants along a chemical trail laid down with pheromones extracted from a gland in the abdomen of a fire ant . <P> Meanwhile , Wilson was blazing other trails . Fascinated by ant societies , he began seeing parallels in the social interactions of birds , lions , monkeys , apes and even humans . In a 1975 book audaciously titled Sociobiology : The New Synthesis , he charted in evolutionary terms the social architecture of a wide range of species  --  their breeding behavior , gender dominance , caste systems . " In a Darwinian sense , " Wilson wrote , " the organism does not live for itself . Its primary function is not even to reproduce other organisms ; it reproduces genes , and it serves as their temporary carrier . " <P> Wilson 's Sociobiology was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 chapters , which dealt with the social systems of nonhuman species , were widely praised as one of the century 's signal scientific achievements . Its 27th chapter , which applied the same analysis to human behavior and culture , was harshly  --  and sometimes violently  --  attacked . At a 1978 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , an impassioned dissenter emptied a pitcher of ice water on him . <P> Despite the mixed reaction , Wilson in this and subsequent books  --  culminating with Promethean Fire ( 1983 )  --  accomplished something few scientists can claim . He established a new field of science . It is known to this day as sociobiology . <P> By that time , however , Wilson had moved on . Drawing from his deep knowledge of the earth 's " little creatures " and his sense that their contribution to the planet 's ecology is underappreciated , he produced what may be his most important book , The Diversity of Life ( 1992 ) . In 424 pages he describes how an intricately interconnected natural system is threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinction "  --  the most devastating trauma since the extinction event that laid waste the dinosaurs and other creatures 65 million years ago .
