In Search of William Shakespeare // Before he came into a lot of money in 1839 , Richard Plantagenet Temple Nugent Brydges Chandos Grenville , second Duke of Buckingham and Chandos , led a largely uneventful life . // He sired an illegitimate child in Italy , spoke occasionally in the Houses of Parliament against the repeal of the Corn Laws , and developed an early interest in plumbing ( his house at Stowe , in Buckinghamshire , had nine of the first flush toilets in England ) , but otherwise was distinguished by nothing more than his glorious prospects and many names . But after inheriting his titles and one of England 's great estates , he astonished his associates , and no doubt himself , by managing to lose every penny of his inheritance in just nine years through a series of spectacularly unsound investments . // Bankrupt and humiliated , in the summer of 1848 he fled to France , leaving Stowe and its contents to his creditors . The auction that followed became one of the great social events of the age . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of auctioneers from the London firm of Christie and Manson forty days to get through it all . // Among the lesser-noted disposals was a dark oval portrait , twenty-two inches high by eighteen wide , purchased by the Earl of Ellesmere for 355 guineas and known ever since as the Chandos portrait . The painting had been much retouched and was so blackened with time that a great deal of detail was ( and still is ) lost . It shows a balding but not unhandsome man of about forty who sports a trim beard . In his left ear he wears a gold earring . His expression is confident , serenely rakish . This is not a man , you sense , to whom you would lightly entrust a wife or grown daughter . // Although nothing is known about the origin of the painting or where it was for much of the time before it came into the Chandos family in 1747 , it has been said for a long time to be of William Shakespeare . Certainly it looks like William Shakespeare  --  but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three likenesses of Shakespeare from which all other such likenesses are taken . // In 1856 , shortly before his death , Lord Ellesmere gave the painting to the new National Portrait Gallery in London as its founding work . As the gallery 's first acquisition , it has a certain sentimental prestige , but almost at once its authenticity was doubted . Many critics at the time thought the subject was too dark-skinned and foreign looking  --  too Italian or Jewish  --  to be an English poet , much less a very great one . Some , to quote the late Samuel Schoenbaum , were disturbed by his " wanton " air and " lubricious " lips . ( One suggested , perhaps a touch hopefully , that he was portrayed in stage makeup , probably in the role of Shylock. ) // " Well , the painting is from the right period  --  we can certainly say that much , " Dr. Tarnya Cooper , curator of sixteenth-century portraits at the gallery , told me one day when I set off to find out what we could know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English language . " The collar is of a type that was popular between about 1590 and 1610 , just when Shakespeare was having his greatest success and thus most likely to sit for a portrait . We can also tell that the subject was a bit bohemian , which would seem consistent with a theatrical career , and that he was at least fairly well to do , as Shakespeare would have been in this period . " // I asked how she could tell these things . // " Well , the earring tells us he was bohemian , " she explained . " An earring on a man meant the same then as it does now  --  that the wearer was a little more fashionably racy than the average person . Drake and Raleigh were both painted with earrings . It was their way of announcing that they were of an adventurous disposition . Men who could afford to wore a lot of jewelry back then , mostly sewn into their clothes . So the subject here is either fairly discreet , or not hugely wealthy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can tell that he was prosperous  --  or wished us to think he was prosperous  --  because he is dressed all in black . " // She smiled at my look of puzzlement . " It takes a lot of dye to make a fabric really black . Much cheaper to produce clothes that were fawn or beige or some other lighter color . So black clothes in the sixteenth century were nearly always a sign of prosperity . " // She considered the painting appraisingly . " It 's not a bad painting , but not a terribly good one either , " she went on . " It was painted by someone who knew how to prime a canvas , so he 'd had some training , but it is quite workaday and not well lighted . The main thing is that if it is Shakespeare , it is the only portrait known that might have been done from life , so this would be what William Shakespeare really looked like  --  if it is William Shakespeare . " // And what are the chances that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never know , and it 's unlikely now , after such a passage of time , that such documentation will ever turn up . " // And if not Shakespeare , who is it ? // She smiled . " We 've no idea . " // If the Chandos portrait is not genuine , then we are left with two other possible likenesses to help us decide what William Shakespeare looked like . The first is the copperplate engraving that appeared as the frontispiece of the collected works of Shakespeare in 1623  --  the famous First Folio . // The Droeshout engraving , as it is known ( after its artist , Martin Droeshout ) , is an arrestingly  --  we might almost say magnificently  --  mediocre piece of work . Nearly everything about it is flawed . One eye is bigger than the other . The mouth is curiously mispositioned . The hair is longer on one side of the subject 's head than the other , and the head itself is out of proportion to the body and seems to float off the shoulders , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apologetic , almost frightened  --  nothing like the gallant and confident figure that speaks to us from the plays . //
