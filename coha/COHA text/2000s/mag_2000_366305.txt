When President Clinton proposed giving $1.6 billion in military aid to fight drug lords in Colombia last week , he probably never thought of the U'Wa Indians . But the tribe is fighting off attempts by Occidental Petroleum to drill for an estimated 1.5 billion bbl. of oil on ancestral lands in the northeast of the country ; hundreds of the U'Wa are currently involved in a tense standoff with Colombian troops trying to remove them from drilling sites . <P> This week in New Hampshire , U.S. activists plan to show up waving placards demanding that AL GORE take a stand . Why Gore ? Because he helps control up to $500,000 worth of Oxy stock inherited from his father AL GORE SR. , a longtime Occidental board member . Those shares could be worth a lot more if Oxy strikes it rich in Colombia ; activists also note that Occidental 's chairman , RAY IRANI , gave Democrats $100,000 shortly after he spent the night in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House . The executive director of the Sierra Club , among others , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Veep never penned a reply . Perhaps this week in New Hampshire , he will get another chance . <P>  --  By Adam Zagorin/Washington
