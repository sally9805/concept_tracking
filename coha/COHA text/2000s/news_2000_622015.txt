<p> NEW RUNWAYS A THREAT TO THE BAY <p> Editor  --  Your enthusiastic support for the Audubon Society plan to save San Francisco Bay wetlands ( Chronicle , April 7 ) is a great encouragement in this effort . Your April 7 editorial , " Grand Vision for the Bay , " however , stands in sad contrast to a grand nightmare for the bay , which is the current plan of San Francisco International Airport to massively fill the bay to create expanded runways . Add to this Oakland airport 's plan to do the very same and we can all begin a deathwatch for this bay . A preliminary review by scientists determined that this project will wreak havoc on habitats and change bay current flows to unforeseeable magnitudes . <p> The political entities that can let this nightmare become reality are motivated by shortsighted local political needs and pushed hard by constant pressure from powerful commercial interests . These special interests and the political power they wield will be very hard to overcome . <p> It is sad to say , but it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making . Experience shows that we can expect no " profiles in courage " from politicians , but simply business as usual . Let 's not focus on the " Grand Vision " until we can awake from this grand nightmare . <p> MICHAEL NURRE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SAVE COWELL RANCH <p> Editor  --  In the battles over Bay Area growth , someone usually loses . All too often , communities lose the land to sprawl . Sometimes , developers lose their profits to litigation . But , occasionally , there is a real opportunity for a win-win situation . <p> Such is the case for Cowell Ranch , 4,200 acres of open space and agricultural land in East Contra Costa County . Environmentalists have been fighting to protect the land , while the landowners , the S.H . Cowell Foundation , have been working to sell it to developers . <p> Now the Cowell Foundation actually has an opportunity to sell the land to environmentalists . The American Land Conservancy has made a generous offer to purchase the land from the Cowell Foundation to protect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer so that everyone wins . <p> EVELYN STIVERS <p> Greenbelt Alliance <p> Walnut Creek <p> . <p> FICTION ON WILLITS <p> Editor  --  Your front page March 31 article ( " A Town Diseased and Torn , Willits split on whether illnesses are due to chemicals left by shuttered plant , " ) gives a distorted view of Willits . <p> The fiction begins with a page one picture caption . Actually , the ditch and water shown do not contain chromium . More important , our medical community assures us there is no current way for us to be exposed to materials from the former Remco facility . <p> The fiction continues when you claim that most people here do n't drink the water . Please provide the scientific research supporting this claim . Scientific tests show it is clean and safe . Incidentally , we get our water seven miles upstream of the Remco plant . <p> As a restaurant owner , I rely on tourism to make a living . Your sensational journalism , your fiction , hurts our city and the ability of Willits residents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I care about the health of my family and neighbors . But your speculation on individual health problems only adds to the sensationalism . Where is the scientific information on chromium and diseases ? <p> Willits is a warm , welcoming community that offers visitors relaxing and beautiful surroundings . As the Remco site is cleaned up , we also offer a safe town , where the water is pure and the air is fresh . For these and other reasons , our city faces a bright future , not the future your fiction claims . <p> WILLIAM R. VAZZANA <p> Willits <p> . <p> PINOCCHIO BROWN <p> Editor  --  If Amos Brown were Pinocchio , his nose would reach from District 11 to the Ferry Building . By trying to justify a misguided tenant-eviction with rhetoric and falsehoods , his political folly becomes almost pathetic . I did n't evict her . . . she was planning on moving . Sure . <p> WALTER G. JEBE Sr. <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CIVILIZED TRAVEL <p> Editor  --  Having just stepped off a 43-hour Amtrak ride from Iowa , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice : Amtrak was on time , the sleeper and dining car service is up-to-par , and nobody lost my luggage . America-out-the-window is superb ! <p> Granted , Amtrak is slow and probably not for many business travelers . But greater patronage would cause Amtrak to increase the number of trains , and would encourage the development of faster trains . <p> Go , Amtrak  --  the airlines need the competition . And it 's civilized , convenient and fun . <p> NANCY L. PETERSON <p> Albany <p> . <p> BUSH 'S DISCONNECT <p> Editor  --  Despite the fact that Texas ranks nationally near the top in the rate of AIDS cases , Gov . George W. Bush expressed disappointment that condoms were included in a list of over-the-counter medical products that will be exempt from Texas sales tax . <p> Apparently Mr. Bush , who straddles the line between the homophobia of the Christian right and the conservative belief in not spending much for public health services , believes that abstinence should be promoted to Texas teenagers instead of condom use . Moreover , Gov . Bush has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even refused to sign a bill that would have increased penalties for hate crimes . <p> GEORGE BANKS <p> San Leandro <p> . <p> MANNING 'S MEMORIES <p> Editor  --  I was delighted with the letter from Donald Neely ( April 6 ) and the mention of old San Francisco and long gone places . I worked as cashier at Manning 's on Brannan Street for many years . It was the best place to work . And it was the place to have breakfast and lunch . <p> We were mentioned in Herb Caen 's column , had wonderful customers , among them Paul B. ( Red ) Fay and many others , famous and not so famous . These customers became our friends over the years . <p> I 'm sure the mention of Manning 's stirred a memory to many readers and customers . And sadly there are only two of us alive today in the area who worked there . <p> DARLENE McDONNAL <p> Oakland <p> . <p> GOOD NEWS <p> EDITOR  --  I want to register my pleasure at the increase of recent articles in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the special school on Treasure Island for tough kids , and the local doctor donating his services in far-away countries to help blind people see . <p> I pick articles to pray about where I feel especially touched by the story , but inevitably they are stories of sorrow and grief . What joy it is to have more stories to rejoice about , to give thanks for those among us who are generous and loving . <p> RAY RIESS <p> Oakland <p> . <p> JOE DIMAGGIO FIELD <p> Editor  --  Congratulations to Supervisor Gavin Newsom for his persistence in officially relabeling the North Beach Playground Joe DiMaggio Field . The playground has been the home field for our softball team , Les Lapins Sauvages , since the late 1970s . We 've been calling the playground Joe DiMaggio Field even before the 1980 Park and Rec vote . <p> It 's been well noted that generations of great players of Italian heritage played in the park . Gino Cimoli and dozens of other professional ballplayers played in leagues there . Now the park is used by new ethnic groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noted that the DiMaggio funeral cortege stopped first at Joe 's small field after his funeral service , a mere block and a half from SS Peter and Paul Church . More than once , I talked to Joe about the fun our team had playing on the field where he and his brothers matured . This always brought a warm smile in remembrance of his youthful happy days at the park . <p> Hats off , also , to Mayor Willie Brown for backing Newsom 's plan and for standing up to the unenlightened Mr. Engelberg . <p> P.S. For the record , the field is not concrete , but asphalt and many North Beach ballplayers still have a hunk of the black stuff in the backsides from vigorous slides . <p> ED MOOSE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FOR THE RECORD <p> Due to an editing error , yesterday 's headline did not reflect the meaning of the lead letter by Susan E. Banashek of the California Bankers Association . Her letter argued that the " opt-out " provision in federal law was sufficient to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Chronicle regrets the misleading headline .
