Two randy teenagers ( Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna ) hook up with a restless older woman ( Maribel Verdu ) for a Mexican joyride in search of the perfect beach . If this sounds like an old-fashioned sex comedy , it is  --  sexy , for sure , and funny , in wild spurts . But Cuaron 's movie , a worldwide hit , also serves as a tour through his convulsive homeland . The gritty life of Mexico occasionally splats on the window of a car whose privileged passengers speed on to their own escape from reality . <P>  --  R.C.
