" Is it the devil we 're running from , then ? " The question , uttered in the mildest of tones , made Harry Lester wince . " Worse , " he threw over his shoulder at his groom and general henchman , Dawlish . " The matchmaking mamas  --  in league with the dragons of the ton . " Harry edged back on the reins , feathering a curve at speed . He saw no reason to ease the wicked pace . His match greys , sleek and powerful , were quite content to keep the bits between their teeth . His curricle rushed along in their wake ; Newmarket lay ahead . " And we 're not running  --  it 's called a strategic retreat . " " Is that so ? Well , ca n't say I blame you , " came in Dawlish 's dour accents . " Who 'd ever have thought to see Master Jack landed  --  and without much of a fight , if Pinkerton 's on the up . Right taken aback , is Pinkerton . " When this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position , he is . " Harry snorted . " Nothing will part Pinkerton from Jack  --  not even a wife . He 'll swallow the pill when the time comes . " " Aye  --  p'raps . Still , ca n't say I 'd relish the prospect of answering to a missus  --  not after all these years . " Harry 's lips quirked . Realising that Dawlish , riding on the box behind him , could n't see it , he gave into the urge to smile . Dawlish had been with him forever , having , as afifteen-year-old groom , attached himself to the second son of the Lester household the instant said son had been put atop a pony . Their old cook had maintained it was a clear case of like to like ; Dawlish 's life was horses  --  he had recognised a master in the making and had followed doggedly in his wake . " You need n't worry , you old curmudgeon . I can assure you I 've no intention , willingly or otherwise , of succumbing to any siren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dawlish grumbled . " But when these things happen , seems like there 's no gainsaying them . Just look at Master Jack . " " I 'd rather not , " Harry curtly replied . Dwelling on his elder brother 's rapid descent into matrimony was an exercise guaranteed to shake his confidence.With only two years separating them , he and Jack had led much the same lives . They 'd come on the town together more than ten years ago . Admittedly , Jack had less reason than he to question love 's worth , nevertheless , his brother had been , as Dawlish had observed , a most willing conquest . The fact made him edgy . " You planning on keeping from London for the rest of yore life ? " " I sincerely hope it wo n't come to that . " Harry checked the greys for a slight descent . The heath lay before them , a haven free of matchmakers and dragons alike . " Doubtless my uninterest will be duly noted . With any luck , if I lay low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would n't have thought , with all the energy you 've put into raising a reputation like you have , that they 'd be so keen . " Harry 's lip curled . " Money , Dawlish , will serve to excuse any number of sins . " He waited , expecting Dawlish to cap the comment with some gloomy pronouncement to the effect that if the madams of society could overlook his transgressions then no one was safe . But no comment came ; his gaze fixed unseeing on his leader 's ears , Harry grudgingly reflected that the wealth with which he and his brothers , Gerald as well as Jack , had recently been blessed , was indeed sufficient to excuse a lifetime of social sins . His illusions were few  --  he knew who and what he was  --  a rake , one of the wolves of the ton , a hellion , a Corinthian , a superlative rider and exceptional breeder of quality horseflesh , an amateur boxer of note , an excellent shot , a keen and successful huntsman on the field and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his playing field . Capitalising on natural talents , and the position his birth had bestowed , he had spent the years in hedonistic pleasure , sampling women much as he had the wines . There 'd been none to gainsay him , none to stand in his path and challenge his profligate ways . Now , of course , with a positively disgusting fortune at his back , they 'd be lining up to do so . Harry snorted and refocused on the road . The sweet damsels of the ton could offer until they were blue in the face  --  he was n't about to buy . The junction with the road to Cambridge loomed ahead . Harry checked his team , still sprightly despite their dash from London . He 'd nursed them along the main road , only letting them have their heads once they 'd passed Great Chesterford and picked up the less-frequented Newmarket road . They 'd passed a few slower-moving carriages ; most of the gentlemen intent on the week 's racing would already be in Newmarket . About them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few stands of trees , windbreaks and the odd coppice to lend relief . There were no carriages approaching on the Cambridge road ; Harry swung his team onto the hard surface and flicked the leader 's ear . Newmarket  --  and the comfort of his regular rooms at the Barbican Arms  --  lay but a few miles on . " To y'r left . " Dawlish 's warning growl came over his shoulder in the same instant Harry glimpsed movement in the stand of trees bordering the road ahead . He flicked both horses ' withers ; as the lash softly swooshed back up the whip-handle , he slackened the reins , transferring them to his left hand . With his right , he reached for the loaded pistol he kept under the seat , just behind his right boot . As his fingers closed about the chased butt , he registered the incongruity of the scene . Dawlish put it into words , a heavy horse pistol in his hands . " On the king 's highway in broad daylight  --  never-you-mind ! What 's the world a-coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry was n't entirely surprised when the men milling in the trees made no attempt to halt them . They were mounted but , even so , would have had the devil of a time hauling in the flying greys . He counted at least five as they flashed past , all in frieze and heavily muffled . The sound of stifled cursing dwindled behind them . Dawlish muttered darkly , rummaging about re-stowing his pistols . " Stap me , but they even had a wagon backed up in them trees . Right confident of their haul they must be . " Harry frowned . The road curved ahead ; he regathered the slack reins and checked the greys fractionally . They rounded the curve  --  Harry 's eyes flew wide . He hauled back on the reins with all his strength , slewing the greys across the road . They came to a snorting , stamping halt , their noses all but in the low hedge . The curricle rocked perilously , then settled back on its springs . Curses turned the air about his ears blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , not in the ditch . Before him , on the other hand , was a scene of disaster . A travelling carriage lay on its side , not in the ditch but blocking most of the road . It looked as if one of the back wheels had disintegrated ; the ponderous contraption , top-heavy with luggage , had toppled sideways . The accident had only just occurred  --  the upper wheels of the carriage were still slowly rotating . Harry blinked . A young lad , a groom presumably , was struggling to haul a hysterical girl from the ditch . An older man , the coachman from his attire , was hovering anxiously over a thin grey-haired woman , laid out on the ground . The coach team was in a flat panic . Without a word , Harry and Dawlish leapt to the ground and ran to calm the horses . It took a good five minutes to soothe the brutes , good , strong coach horses with the full stubbornness and dim wits of their breed . With the traces finally untangled , Harry left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still helplessly pleading with the tearful girl while the coachman dithered over the older woman , clearly caught between duty and a wish to lend succour , if he only knew how . The woman groaned as Harry walked up . Her eyes were closed ; she lay straight and rigid on the ground , her hands crossed over her flat chest . " My ankle  --  ! " A spasm of pain twisted her angular features , tight under an iron-grey bun . " Damn you , Joshua  --  when I get back on my feet I 'll have your hide for a footstool , I will . " She drew her breath in in a painful hiss . " If I ever get back on my feet . " Harry blinked ; the woman 's tones were startlingly reminiscent of Dawlish in complaining mode . He raised his brows as the coachman lumbered to his feet and touched his forehead . " Is there anyone in the carriage ? " The coachman 's face blanked in shock . " Oh my God ! " Her eyes snapping open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Heather ! " Her startled gaze fell on the carriage . " Damn you , Joshua  --  what are you doing , mooning over me when the mistress is likely lying in a heap ? " Frantically , she hit at the coach-man 's legs , pushing him towards the carriage . " Do n't panic . " The injunction floated up out of the carriage , calm and assured . " We 're perfectly all right  --  just a bit shaken . " The clear , very feminine voice paused before adding , a touch hesitantly , " But we ca n't get out . " With a muttered curse , Harry strode to the carriage , pausing only to shrug out of his greatcoat and fling it into the curricle . Reaching up to the back wheel , he hauled himself onto the body . Standing on the coach 's now horizontal side , he bent and , grasping the handle , hauled the door open . Planting one booted foot on either side of the coach step , he looked down into the dimness within . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily dazzling . A woman stood in the shaft of sunshine pouring through the doorway . Her face , upturned , was heart-shaped ; a broad forehead was set beneath dark hair pulled severely back . Her features were well defined ; a straight nose and full , well-curved lips above a delicate but determined chin . Her skin was the palest ivory , the colour of priceless pearls ; beyond his control , Harry 's gaze skimmed her cheeks and the graceful curve of her slender neck before coming to rest on the ripe swell of her breasts . Standing over her as he was , they were amply exposed to his sight even though her modish carriage dress was in no way indecorous . Harry 's palms tingled . Large blue eyes fringed with long black lashes blinked up at him . For an instant , Lucinda Babbacombe was not entirely sure she had n't sustained a blow on the head  --  what else could excuse this vision , conjured from her deepest dreams ? Tall and lean , broad-shouldered , slim-hipped , he towered above her , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Sunlight haloed his golden locks ; with the light behind him she could not make out his features yet she sensed the tension that held him . Lucinda blinked rapidly . A light blush tinged her cheeks ; she looked away  --  but not before she registered the subdued elegance of his garments  --  the tightly-fitting grey coat , superbly cut , style in every line , worn over clinging ivory inexpressibles , which clearly revealed the long muscles of his thighs . His calves were encased in gleaming Hessians ; his linen was crisp and white . There were , she noted , no fobs or seals hanging at his waist , only a single gold pin in his cravat . Prevailing opinion suggested such severe attire should render a gentleman uninteresting . Unremarkable . Prevailing opinion was wrong . He shifted  --  and a large , long-fingered , extremely elegant hand reached down to her . " Take my hand  --  I 'll pull you up . One of the wheels is shattered  --  it 's impossible to right the carriage . " His voice was deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the silken tones . She glanced up through her lashes . He had moved to the side of the door and had gone down on one knee . The light now reached his face , illuminating features that seemed to harden as her gaze touched them . His hand moved impatiently ; a black sapphire set in a gold signet glimmered darkly . He would need to be very strong to lift her out with one arm . Subduing the thought that her rescue might well prove a greater threat than her plight , Lucinda reached for his hand . Continues ...
