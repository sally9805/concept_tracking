Last Hours // On the final night of his life , Jack happened to glance out the window just before eleven and notice that it was snowing : fat flakes cascading past the porch light , changing direction in a puff of wind like a school of fish veering from a predator . // Had Jack known what lay ahead , the seven hours left to him , he might have done something other than turn back to the television . He might have reached for the phone and called his daughter , a college freshman , to send her his love and let her tap him for spending money one last time . He might have climbed the stairs to his son ? s room , interrupting that bookish boy ? s latest fascination for a discussion of how to help his mother weather widowhood . Jack might have gone to his wife , already in bed , to plan for life without him or remind her where his will was stored or revisit their fondest memories like jewelers scrutinizing rubies . He might simply have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contemplate the infinite . // Instead , Jack plunged his hand into a bag of potato chips , washed a mouthful down with the warm dregs of a beer , and watched the Celtics lose in overtime . He lit a cigarette , an unfiltered Camel  --  he reasoned that if you ? re going to smoke , you might as well taste it . Though he ? d never seen the Celtics play in person , in the morning his loyalty would cost him both five bucks and a razzing from Bo , a coworker buddy who favored the Lakers. // It was December 1 , 1976 , a Monday , and too early for snow . Jack switched off the TV , crushed out his smoke . With a beefy forearm he gathered the empties against his stomach and shuffled into the kitchen . // After shoving everything into the trash , Jack went back through the house dousing lights . He moved slowly , aware that lately the furniture crowded him because he ? d put on so much weight . Always a hefty guy , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s cough he hacked through some mornings , a general sluggishness in his blood . He would have gone to a doctor , but why bother when you already know what the problem is ? You ? re getting older , fifty-six in April , and the beer and the sweet tooth and the butts and the lack of exercise have a bigger effect now than when you were twenty-six . Jack put a hand on his lower back as he bent down to turn off a table lamp . Yes , he should cut down . And exercise . Definitely quit the Camels , God forbid . But a man can not be disciplined about everything . A man who has worked hard all his life also deserves some pleasures , doesn ? t he ? // This line of thinking was so familiar that it was nearly furniture , too . Room by room , Jack flicked switches and left darkness behind him . At the top of the stairs he paused , dimly aware of his heart laboring but also hesitant . Was he forgetting something ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life ? s last sensations and emotions . Yet he did not know . He did not pause to savor , to think : this is the taste of warm beer , bitter yet pleasant ; this is the holy hush of snow falling ; this is the unique sibilance of an empty potato chip bag being crushed into the trash. // Instead , there would be no last words , no consummate gesture , no muttered prayer . Jack did not know that this was his one opportunity to say good-bye . // He glanced into his son ? s room , but the boy was reading and Jack did not interrupt . He passed his daughter ? s room , missed her a moment , then went into the bathroom to brush his teeth . // " It ? s snowing , " Jack called through the open door to his wife . " Really coming down . " // But when he entered the bedroom Jack saw that she was already asleep . A novel lay open on her lap . He placed the book on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose her place . It was a little gesture , miniscule really . But she would notice it when she moved the novel again the following night , putting it away on a shelf  --  she would set aside all reading for many months . At that moment twenty-four hours later , her world having changed utterly , Jack ? s care over so small a thing would touch her in a deep and previously unknown place . For now , though , she dozed . // Jack climbed into bed and shut off the light . Six hours left . Did his mind , then , turn over the lessons of his life ? Did Jack ? s soul ache at all he was about to lose , so that he reached for his wife and sought the comfort of one last embrace ? Did he fear what might come after death  --  a reckoning perhaps , or bliss , or nothing at all ? // No , Jack remembered that the mortgage was due on the third , Wednesday , and he would have to drop off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late fee . // He shifted his pillow . Lately he ? d been folding it over to raise his head while he slept . It helped him breathe , and his wife said he snored less . Jack felt a mild indigestion , that December Monday nearing midnight , but he ignored it and the sensation soon passed . // Then there was only the dark , the quiet house , and in time , dreams . Even on the cusp of ceasing to exist , there are dreams . // The alarm buzzed in darkness and Jack slapped it off : 5:45 a.m . Forty minutes left . Out the window he saw six inches of fresh snow . // Jack was born on April 8 . He and his wife celebrated their August 1 anniversary twenty-nine times . He observed holidays and remembered Mother ? s Days and kids ? birthdays and anniversaries of starting jobs . Jack oriented the compass of time with meaningful dates throughout the year . Yet never had he given a moment ? s thought to his life ? s fifty-five unremarkable December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His son will note the date solemnly every year , honoring his father while in turn ignoring the May 25 that waits with cold patience for him . // Down in the kitchen Jack lit a cigarette , squinting against its smoke as he dug through the hall closet for his boots and parka . A slug of coffee , and out he shuffled into the gray morning . Grabbing a snow shovel , Jack started at the garage and worked his way back . The first few pulls tightened his shoulders . The stuff was heavy . Upstairs the bathroom light went on , meaning his wife was awake , and he began to hurry . // Jack was halfway home when he felt one of his smoking coughs coming on . He straightened , trying to deep-breathe it away . But the air felt as though it went somewhere other than into his lungs , down into his left arm somehow . And when he exhaled , in the place where the breath had been there was a powerful ache . Jack frowned at his arm as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaned the shovel against himself and rubbed his shoulder . How could so small an exertion hurt so much ? // A sledgehammer of pain struck Jack in the chest . His body seemed to fold around it . He clutched the shovel for balance , as if staying upright were the most important thing imaginable . Then Jack ? s knees buckled , slamming his face down on the shovel ? s handle and giving him an instant nosebleed . He leaned to the right , curling around the massive stab in his core . The snow , with an arc of red from his nose , cushioned his fall . // Whatever was happening , Jack thought , it was going to take over the day . The mortgage payment would definitely be late . Already the world was developing a vagueness . The cold against his cheek , the tightness in his lungs  --  they grew distant . The early daylight in some kind of ebb . Even the pain became strangely remote . // Jack ? s eyes roved , and he thought to ask : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humming along with the radio , glanced out the bathroom window . She saw Jack ? s form , prone amid a spray of red . She screamed and screamed . // What is the imprint a body makes when it falls ? Later that morning , when Jack was lifted from where he lay , with all the care that experts in that grim line of work can provide while nearby a stricken wife and son watch , the outline he left was no snow angel . No , if you take a man in a loose parka and tip him sideways with a shovel in his hand , the shape that remains is strange but familiar : a human form , hooded and cloaked , and in his merciless grip the tool that spares no one , the scythe. //
