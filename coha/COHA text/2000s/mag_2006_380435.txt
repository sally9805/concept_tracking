You can absolutely , 100% see why this book seemed like a good idea at the time . Two Manhattan couples are busily glossing over the structural flaws in their marriages and in their personal value systems , minding their own business , when Sept. 11 arrives to smack them upside their well-coiffed heads . And who better to snap the reaction shot than Jay McInerney , novelist to the cool and moneyed , author of Bright Lights , Big City ? Midlife epiphanies , check . Astute social observation , check . Reality check , check . <P> So why is n't The Good Life ( Knopf ; 368 pages ) a better book ? McInerney 's eye is indisputably keen  --  witness such period moments as the dinner where the party favors are prescriptions for the antianthrax drug Cipro . And the book is n't starved for R-rated action : the two couples respond to the crisis with vigorous spasms of partner swapping . <P> But we wait in vain for this catalog of tiny ironies and insights to add up to something wise and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting just a little overskewered ? Or that McInerney 's characters , while capable of surprising themselves and one another , never surprise us ? Or that we wish they were more worthy objects of our readerly sympathy ( " I 've facilitated the movement of capital around the globe like a bee mindlessly carrying pollen , " laments an investment banker  --  poor little bee ! ) ? Or maybe there 's something monstrously asymmetrical about watching the wistful ripples that a cataclysmic act of terrorism sends through the placid , witty lives of the wealthy .
