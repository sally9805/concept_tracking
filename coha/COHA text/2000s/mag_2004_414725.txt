White-collar work is increasingly being automated , or " off-peopled , " just as happened with farming and manufacturing work . To survive , workers will need to develop skills that ca n't be performed by machines . Photograph // Human mental processes are being systematically " off-peopled " - that is , transferred into computers , microchips , networks , and mechanical devices of all types . Think of it as a great global brain drain , the most critically pivotal-either empowering or suicidal-trend of our times . Yet it is underreported by the media and virtually invisible to the public eye . It 's not yet on policy makers ' radar screens . It could create a golden age for everyone but threatens-if current social and business practices continue-to force millions of blue- and white-collar workers below the poverty line while making the rich richer . The Industrial Revolution offers a useful precedent , because we 're starting to feel the same empowerment but suffer the same trauma experienced by laborers , farmers , and craftsmen when machine power extended muscle power but removed sources of livelihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flowing into our tools . People adjusted to the Industrial Revolution by moving from labor-intensive jobs to know-how jobs . That wo n't work this time , because know-how tasks are the very kind being usurped . We need a new strategy for the new transition , and we should not expect an improving economy to restore the quantity and mix of yesterday 's employment . Farming , too , offers a precedent . As recently as 1900 , it took almost 40% of America 's workforce to grow the nation 's food . Today , thanks to progressive mechanization , it takes less than 2% . Factory work has retraced much of farming 's downward trajectory . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) , goodsproducing workers decreased from 38% of the non-farm workforce in 1940 to 17% in 2003 , and it 's not hard to imagine goods production soon joining farming in the less-than-2% club . At that time , the service sector would , by today 's definition , theoretically boast more than 98% of the non-farm workforce . But there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions alike , most of the remaining jobs as we know them are being transferred into all-electronic systems . By 2100 , it is possible that fewer than 2% of the U.S. non-farm workforce will be needed to handle today 's know-how functions in factories , offices , stores , professional suites , hospitals , research labs , and universities . If know-how work is being taken over by ever more-sophisticated tools , what 's left for people to do ? Hyper-Human Work A new class of jobs has yet to be named : work involving hard-toautomate hyper-human skills that go beyond know-how . We can divide today 's service-sector workforce into two types-know-how and hyper-human . Knowhow service workers are likely to plummet to less than 2% of the workforce by the end of the century , but hyper-human service workers may zoom to over 90% . According to BLS , many service-sector jobs lost people during the 1993-2003 decade , when they should have gained 19% just to stay even with the overall increase in the workforce . Examples include travel agents ( down 7% ) , gas station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( down 1% ) , and book publishing employees ( down a fraction of a percent ) . Industries gaining more jobs in the decade included radio and TV broadcasting ( up 16% ) and legal services ( up 15% ) . But the percentage increase of jobs could not keep pace with labor-force growth of 19% . The reason : automation of know-how , allowing more do-it-yourself services ranging from pumping your own gas to filing your own will , publishing your own book , and placing your own orders . Photograph // Some job categories outpaced overall labor-force growth during the decade , but professionals in these fields should not feel immune from brain-drain forces . Accounting and bookkeeping services , for example , gained 39% new jobs . The increase would be even greater were it not for fast-improving do-it-yourself accounting and tax-preparation software . The complexity of accounting , requiring human intervention , stems in large part from the changing constraints of nitpicking laws . Once sophisticated software systems negotiate the intersection of law with accounting and bookkeeping procedures , the need for human number crunchers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical office personnel ( up 42% ) , which always require human caring and consciousness , and people working in colleges and universities ( up 46% ) , which need live people for motivation and creative interaction . White Collars in the Cross Hairs In today 's major corporations , white-collar jobs are being targeted with a vengeance . The reason , of course , is to increase productivity and the bottom line in order to remain competitive and to provide ever-increasing value to customers and stockholders , not to mention senior management . It is possible that we are less than 5% into the Information Age in terms of the mental functions that may be usurped by electronic intelligence . Internet 2 , now in development in research and academic organizations , is expected to offer data transfer speeds up to a thousand times faster than today 's commercial Internet . The future Internet could resemble a gigantic intellectual utility that can operate without human oversight . Expert systems-already practical in fields such as oil exploration-could soon begin rivaling college professors , career counselors , biotech researchers , investment advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Self-aware computing " is being developed by IBM and DARPA ( the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which spawned the Internet ) . Complex electronic systems monitor their own performance , self-correct , and self-maintain-without human intervention . The impact on human workers could be moderate or very great . When nanotechnology becomes practical as a production and data tool , will automation accelerate at warp speed ? Only time will tell . Through a mix of developments that can not be mapped precisely , the nature of work is changing rapidly . Look for know-how services to join agriculture and manufacturing in the **29;3075;TOOLONG club well before the end of the century . While information technology ( IT ) is a key cause of the jobless recovery it has become , ironically , its most prominent new victim . Even chief information officer ( CIO ) jobs are in jeopardy . Three trends are either eliminating IT jobs or sending them overseas : * Mergers and restructuring combine multiple programmer , analyst , or CIO positions into one . * Improvements by enterprise software and platform providers simplify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffs are required . * IT functions are being jobbed out to service providers such as IBM . This reduces not only in-company IT staffs , but also overall IT employment , since service providers introduce economies of scale to remain competitive . One of these economies is offshoring of the IT work , expected to siphon off a significantly higher percentage of IT service firm jobs than other white-collar jobs , according to Gartner Inc . Job Creation Is Not Automatic " When technology eliminates jobs , it creates new , better ones . " This old saw has been largely true until now . Technology did replace blue-collar jobs with new white-collar positions . But the future does not always mimic the past . New jobs are being created , but they are not always a step up from the disappearing kind . For example , during the 1993-2003 decade , 1.7 million new jobs in the United States were created in eating and dining places , an increase of 26% . That 's great if , when you lose your IT job , you want to wait tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If technology can automate grocery check-outs it can also automate burger serving . Already , fast-food restaurants have streamlined food preparation and conditioned customers to fetch their own tableware , napkins , and drinks . Photograph Knowledge workers need to develop social skills that ca n't be automated . // The reason that technology no longer creates new and better jobs is that electronic technology is an entirely different animal . Work itself needs to be redefined , and new forms of work need to be invented . Like machinery in the transition to the industrial age , electronic systems are simultaneously empowering us and displacing us . The benefits can be great , but two drawbacks loom . They 're the same drawbacks that prevailed as our muscles got augmented and replaced in the transition from the agricultural to the industrial age : ( 1 ) the trauma of transition , and ( 2 ) the prospect of unintended bad consequences at the mature end of the transition . The present trauma of transition is likely to vex all of us and will severely oppress many . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given the pace of technological change . What are we supposed to do ? What 's the right career path for today 's travel agent or VP of marketing ? The infiltration of electronic methodology is widespread and relentless . Safe havens are becoming harder and harder to identify ; whitecollar , professional , and management people are being challenged even if their job type has n't changed much , thanks to technology-driven restructuring that has morphed stable companies into volatile , shortterm employers . Unless we consciously intervene , the trauma of change , already acute for many , will get worse as the transition to global electronic intelligence accelerates . The Right Strategy for Now As know-how gets easier and easier to store and apply through networks and automatic systems , the winning strategy is to move up from know-how work to " hyper-human " or " meta-mental " work , which consists of those functions that computers can not easily replicate , so humans are still required . Balance off-peopling by calling more heavily on our most human qualities . Computers and electronically powered systems are inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine logic , mass data storage and retrieval , remote sensing and control , structured or routine decision making , and the like . Humans ca n't expect to win out against electronics at any of these things , though we can struggle at it for a few years . So where are we inherently superior ? We 're alive and electronic systems are n't . Aliveness makes a big , vital difference-one that may be overlooked by decision makers under competitive pressures . Consider what aliveness involves : * Conscious perception and motor control . * Wanting , valuing , intending . * Pursuing ethical objectives . * Love , friendliness , and other positive feelings and behaviors. * Creativity and imagination . * Subjective decision making . * Hypothesizing. * Social skills . Aliveness , in its best mode , also includes a vital overall ingredient : reflection or metaconsciousness . In our brightest moments , we 're not just conscious , but conscious of our consciousness . Reflection or selfawareness defines the properly functioning , responsible human . In moving to hyper-human work , we need to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide today 's service sector into two strands : know-how service work , which is rapidly being taken over by technology , and hyper-human service work that requires people . We also need to track hyper-human forms of manual work that are performed with creativity , pleasure , and life . Examples include urban agriculture , specialized engineering , local production , artistic creation , and many varieties of nurturing . In addition , we need to acknowledge our informal economy , in which we share things and services with family , friends , and colleagues without resorting to cash . This " free " economy could expand greatly as hyper-human activity gains sway . Some believe the United States is transitioning from an industrial society to something higher in the occupational pecking order : an " idea economy . " Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has spoken of an America where value is no longer derived by creating and moving things , but by creating and moving ideas . Surely this is a sound direction if " ideation " is appropriately defined . Ideation needs to be cultivated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telemarketers may become " business/customer liaisons . " // But it 's important to recognize that ideas spring up close to where things happen-in agriculture , manufacturing , and get-your-hands-dirty service work as well as in basic research , big-iron engineering , biotech development , or global marketing . Former secretary of State Henry Kissinger has warned that outsourcing could suck the innovative life out of America 's industrial base . Ideas for improvement come from the factory workers , engineers , and managers where the work is done . As more and more white-collar jobs , especially high-tech forms , are offshored , sources of the new ideas and intellectual property are likely to go with them . Intel founder and CEO Andrew Grove has predicted that tomorrow 's most advanced engineering could come from India or China . Ideas generation needs to remain strong locally for any country 's economy to thrive . In fact , it should grow stronger along with an accentuation of other hyper-human skills . Hyper-human skills flourish in active pursuits-including food proauction , making things , and helping others-where we engage our bodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions , not just airy thinking . // Transitioning to the Hyper-Human Economy // Hyper-human work will shift our attention back to the local and ternper our focus on the global . Selecting goods that are best produced a mile away rather than a continent away or growing and purchasing food grown within walking distance rather than flying distance , for example , are hyper-human approaches that counter mindless globalization , which too often creates enormous wealth for a few while destroying communities , distorting economies , taxing the environment , and disrupting employment . In order to move to a hyperhuman future , we need to mobilize hyper-human skills right now : clear , sensible thinking as well as caring , responsible goal setting , planning , and determination . Transition Tactics As a practical matter , how can we get to the hyper-human economy without getting lost in the transition ? Here are some sensible steps that may be taken by corporations , governments , and individuals . Strategies for Corporations * Offshore if survival depends on it , but prepare for employee backlash , including union organizing. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally can downsize , offshore , and cut human costs only so far . At some point , a weakened middle class will lose buying power . A consumer engine without steam , plus alienated employees , could spell the death of many companies . * Add hyper-human functions to existing tasks through job redefinition and training . For example , restructure customer-service departments that merely field complaints into customer concierge services that follow through until each unique customer problem is satisfactorily solved . * Automate know-how to support hyper-human functions , not replace people . Pursue off-peopling with a parallel people-empowering plan . For example , as customer-service departments automate their complaintfielding functions , make sure that your Web site , Web services , and automated telephone menus reliably answer basic current questions and redirect customers to real people in the right departments rather than sending them into frustrating , impersonal loops . This requires technical-support workers equally proficient in technology and people skills , as well as creative problem solving . * Put increased emphasis on " mental models " that promote practical reflection in areas such as product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have demonstrated that a mental model triggering creativity or causefinding at the right moment can save millions of dollars or many years of lost opportunity . CEOs of large firms had better lead the revolution by creating new and better jobs . Otherwise , they will be the victims of union resurgence , professional associations turned militant , legislative constraints , and activism of all sorts . Vandalism by angry employees is already a concern of corporate security departments , as is cybervandalism . Running a large company is not just about making money or making stockholders happy , and not even just about making customers happy . It 's about serving society , building community , improving the general lot of everyone . Surely that includes serving the needs of employees and building sound corporate cultures . The future may belong to companies like GE , 3M , and IBM that-recent aberrations aside-have traditionally placed a high value on customer service , innovation , teamwork , and constant improvement with minimum human casualty . Look for a new emphasis on human-centered business practices , training and development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Call it " corporate aliveness . " Look for more jobs recast to include the " aliveness " qualities exhibited by entrepreneurs , inventors , authors , composers , teachers , and others who like to be creative , do good , and empower others . Strategies for Governments and Concerned Citizens * Beef up the hyper-human content of educational programs . In grammar through grad school , put more emphasis on creativity , discovery , ethics , entrepreneurship , and flexible problem solving . Photograph // * Rebuild the local . Balance globalization by putting a new emphasis on cohesive communities , in the United States and abroad . Promote " intercommunities " - physical analogs of Internet nodes in which living , earning , learning , and culture coexist and reinforce one another in close proximity . Ed. note : For examples of budding intercommunities , visit **30;3106;TOOLONG * Use investment and philanthropy to revive local-job-creating small businesses . Encourage the wealthy to invest a fraction of their wealth in a small-business superfund . Strategies for Individuals * Gradually move to work high on the hyper-human scale . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs for many ; over the longer term , smart zippy systems will prevail . If a form of work takes creativity , goal-focus , ethical behavior , responsibility , and social skills , it 's likely to have a future and generate income eventually , if not right away . Entrepreneurship will be in demand for a long time , as will intrapreneurship within companies . So will scientific research requiring " aha 's , " health care , education , and social services of all types . If an endeavor requires vision and caring , if there 's a need for it and you love it , it may be just the thing that makes you money at some point . * Constantly hone your hyperhuman skills . be a generalist and get better and better at all the things that make people special , from caring to innovation to persuasion . That will help your bottom line in any kind of work at any time . * Cut back , simplify . Do n't count on corporate or social policy to protect your livelihood . In the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other countries willing to work for a few thousand dollars per year . In the United States , employers will increasingly use the pressure of foreign pay scales to negotiate lower pay domestically . Find ways to live beautifully on less . ( Not easy , but it may be essential . ) The winning strategy for the hyperhuman economy is to inject " aliveness " - including deliberate reflection-into everything we do , and let electronic systems take over the dull , dead stuff .
