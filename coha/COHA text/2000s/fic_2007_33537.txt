Chillin ' at the School Store My name is A.J. and I hate school . The only cool part of Ella Mentry School is the school store . It 's a little room near the office where they sell stuff . Mostly they have pencils and pens and junk like that . They never have anything useful , like skateboards or video games . Still , it 's cool to buy stuff when you 're at school . The school store is open in the morning before the bell rings . The only problem is , I spent all my allowance over the weekend on a new football because some kid stole mine . So I did n't even have a dime to buy anything at the school store . Bummer in the summer ! " Guess what I bought with my own money ? " this girl with curly brown hair named Andrea Young whispered to her crybaby friend Emily . Knowing Andrea , it was probably an encyclopedia . " What did you buy ? " asked Emily . " An encyclopedia ! " Andrea said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids ! " Ugh . Andrea loves reading and books and school and anything else that 's boring . She keeps a dictionary on her desk so she can look up words and show everybody how much she knows . Andrea is like a human filing cabinet . " You know what I 'm going to do with my encyclopedia ? " Andrea asked Emily . Knowing Andrea , she would probably read the whole thing in ABC order so she would know everything in the world . " I 'm going to read it in ABC order , " Andrea bragged . " If I finish one letter every day , by the end of the month I 'll know everything ! Wo n't that be cool ? " Yeah , cool like an oven . I wish a set of encyclopedias would fall on Andrea 's head . The bell rang and we all rushed to class . Our teacher , Miss Daisy , told us to put away our stuff and get ready for circle time . That 's when we sit around in a circle , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school secretary , Mrs. Patty , came over the loudspeaker . " Miss Daisy , please send Andrea and A.J. to Ms. Coco 's room . " " Oooooh ! " my friend Ryan said . " A.J. and Andrea are going to Ms. Coco 's room again . They must be in love ! " " When are you gon na get married ? " asked my other friend Michael . If those guys were n't my best friends , I would hate them .
