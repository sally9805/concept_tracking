I was born in Johannesburg , in South Africa . My family moved to the U.S. when I was two , and then we moved back to South Africa when I was 13 . But then we lived back and forth between Johannesburg and Virginia . <P> Growing up in America , I was made hyperaware of racism . And then going to South Africa , the concept was punctuated at a pretty young age , 13 or 14 . I became more and more horrified , first at the absurdity of it but then with the horror that comes of it : the power that 's put into the wrong people 's hands . Seeing people thrown off trains . Watching people being arrested , or people being molested by the authorities , or friends being mistreated . <P> One of the results of that kind of a society is that all the media , all the entertainment , are really separated . I could listen to English radio or Afrikaans radio or Zulu radio , and they did n't cross over . There was no mixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to was Afrikaans . And then English music was mostly on the English stations . Though the English claimed to be the sort of liberal people in power , their whole identification had nothing to do with Africa . It was all Europe . <P> My high school in South Africa was integrated . But once I left , I realized it really was n't that integrated . The fact that there were a couple of black kids there , a couple of Indian kids there , just meant that they were coming there to get an English-based education . It was n't like we were coming there to learn about each other 's cultures . <P> And that 's why it was only later on , when I was traveling more around the world , that I became more aware of all the diversity in South Africa . I grew up listening to , because of my parents , Hugh Masekela and Abdullah Ibrahim , knowing about Miriam Makeba . But only when I got out of high school did I start to get into the more contemporary people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Juluka , which was an integrated band . And then , from them , I became aware of the Soweto String Quartet . <P> I go back to South Africa at least once a year , sometimes twice , and usually for a month . And probably , I 'm guessing , I 'll spend more time back there as I get older . <P> South Africa gives me a perspective of what 's real and what 's not real . America 's very far from a state of natural existence . In America , we 're as concerned about who 's pregnant on a TV show as we are about whether or not the temperature of the globe is going up . Our perspective is warped by this TV fantasy culture . One thing that worries me in the U.S. is this sort of mad attempt to somehow resegregate ourselves . There 's some sort of strange fractionalization going on again . The thing that has made the music of America in many ways dominate the world is that we come from the world , and the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa to both lose myself and gain awareness of myself . Every time I go back , it does n't take long for me to get caught into a very different thing . A very different sense of myself . It 's a melting pot , southern Africa . You find these cultural collisions that result in art and music , and it 's pretty amazing .
