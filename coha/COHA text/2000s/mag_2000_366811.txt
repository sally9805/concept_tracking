He is so colorless , so ordinary a man you could not pick him out of a crowd . Prying eyes would slide right by the slight , spare figure with the bland , expressionless face . The perfect anonymity of a spy . He built a career on being a nonentity , the man you ca n't know , operating in the twilight world of cold war espionage , where power lies with the man who is a mystery to all but himself . <P> Now Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has been catapulted from the shadows into the most public of positions : President of all Russia . He is about to inherit constitutional powers akin to a Czar 's in what is called an election but amounts to a coronation . But make no mistake : this was not a fair fight . Putin was handpicked for this handover by a tiny cabal in the Kremlin , little different from the ways of the old Soviet Central Committee . Boris Yeltsin and his cronies needed a successor loyal enough to give them the guarantee they craved of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could have been anyone . Putin happened to have the right qualities in the right place at the right time . <P> Putin was lucky , but he also made his luck . Look at his eyes . Blue as steel . Cold as the Siberian ice . They bore into you , but you can not penetrate them . Sometimes they 're a mirror , reflecting what you want to see . Sometimes they 're a mask disguising real intentions . Those eyes are Putin 's strongest feature  --  not counting his unflinching will . He has proved a consummate opportunist , riding into office on loyalty to his bosses and then war fervor . President Putin will succeed where predecessors failed , says Chief of Staff and confidant Dmitri Kozak , " because the will is there . Discipline and will . " <P> Should we be afraid ? He has done some things ( like fighting a bloodbath war in Chechnya ) and said some things ( like his talk of a strong state ) that give pause . He has said other things , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has deliberately left a great deal ambiguous . He has used the brief official campaign not as an occasion for exposure but as a careful exercise in saying the right things to the right people . Putin , say those who have followed his rise , has always been extremely good at that . <P> Everyone agrees on some other things about Putin . He is polite , meticulous , efficient . He is focused , intense , decisive . He likes systems ; he loves order . The universal applied adjective is pragmatic . He is very smart and very , very disciplined . Russian citizens have embraced him as the anti-Yeltsin : tough , sober , sensible . Being an unknown gave him an advantage ; he has tailored his appeal to be all things to all people . The Russian longing for a strong hand is perfectly matched by Putin 's willingness to wield one . <P> The main act of his rule so far , the war in Chechnya , has shown that he is a ruthless practitioner of power . That is the self-evident message of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls " my mission , my historic mission ... to sort out the situation in the North Caucasus , " Putin has not flinched under mounting casualties or criticism . Says a British Foreign Office analyst : " He 's a hard-nosed , unsentimental individual who takes very , very tough decisions and pursues them with complete ruthlessness . "
