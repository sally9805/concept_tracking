On hot days Ralph hunts small birds . The younger brother , Willy , carries the .22 scope and a leather sack over his shoulder . He knows enough not to speak . Just keep up , Willy . Come on . Ralph lips the cool sweat from his face . <p> Willy sees the red-tailed hawk first , swinging down from the sky like a kite . He stops . Then , Ralph . Their daddy 's said , " Never kill a predator . It 's like killing a piece of the land . " But Burgess is n't there . He has n't been around for days , not since he said he would be driving into town . Ralph stretches his shooting hand to Willy and has to look hard before Willy gives him the .22 . Willy shakes his head . Ralph cradles the end of the rifle into his shoulder and pulls the trigger . Willy slams his hands over his ears but he can still hear the sound of the red-tail falling from the sky . <p> Ralph chortles , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throat , but it was hard to see this time . He needs to know if he made a clean kill . Anyone can shoot , Burgess has taught them . It 's making a clean kill . That 's the point of it . The tall , wild grass releases a swell of early evening flavors . He turns to hand the gun to Willy , but Willy is gone . Ralph corners his eyes between the trees toward the house . Damn you , butt fuck ! Damn you ! Go on , run . Run , while you can . <p> Burgess has always worshipped the woods and mountain ridge behind the house . Here he camps and smokes and sits on the granite rock and boulders , talking to the boys about the meaning of things . Every month or so the three of them sleep outside , high on the ridge . The boys are too young at first to notice more than the cold and the cramped size of the sleeping bag and tent they share . One night it rained so hard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lightning flashed and the autumn thunder shook the dark clouds above their heads . Barrels of cold rain fell over the collapsed tent . Still inside the sleeping bag , Willy 's arms and legs were shaking . The cold had sunk into his bones , and he wanted to go back to the house . <p> Burgess told Willy , " You stay inside until the tent is back up . " <p> Burgess made Ralph get up and go outside . He made him watch how to do it right . Burgess methodically re-staked and re-tied the tent clips . Willy felt black mud sliding beneath him . The smell of earth and worms poured through the nylon weave . He heard Burgess whistling like they were at a picnic , as if the day was long , but it was n't , not even close . <p> Ralph crowded back inside the newly risen tent and kicked Willy with his boot . Willy moaned . <p> Ralph screamed , " Shut up . I ca n't see the left side of my ass . It 's darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little angel . " <p> Burgess smacked Ralph hard . Ralph cried out . " I did n't see him , Pa . I did n't . " <p> Before his eyes fell shut , Willy smelled the cold , the rain roaring over their heads . Everyone fell into a dreamless sleep like the dark of night it was . Oh , God . Run , Willy ! Run toward the house ! Their old , familiar house . Fat gray stones apron around the front just behind the long-faced porch Willy and Burgess painted - no , whitewashed - last spring . <p> " Now , do n't get any paint on those stones . Those stones were set during the Revolutionary War . That 's a fact . " <p> " Yes , sir . That 's a fact . " <p> " Arc you mocking me , boy ? " <p> " No , way . I am not , Pa . Not at all . " <p> Willy runs under the pockmarked boulders of the upper ridge , past mountain lion tracks and small hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wide sleeves of Douglas fir . He does n't want to hear the laugh at the end of every shoot . He knows Ralph smells the bird first . Willy 's lungs begin to stick . The lining feels like it 's inside out , as if hundreds of small , insignificant knives are pricking the delicate membrane . He gasps for air , but it wo n't go in , not when it 's tight like this . He stops , bends over , wiping the sweat from his face . Slow down , Willy , or you 'll faint and drop out of the sky like that red-tail . <p> He pushes himself up and scrambles beneath the cedar fence for their grazing meadow , making stands of wild daisies float up from the earth beneath the weathered wood . Willy lifts his head . He 's almost there . On the other side of the meadow the cows are clustered at the north end , where the grass tufts remain thick and rich . They bellow softly , making sounds like a woman . Willy rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grazing meadow across a pebbled road - the road Burgess matted and trucked into existence by himself years ago so he could drive in his red pick-up from the paved county road to their house without cutting a tire in half . <p> A mile away , Ralph has picked up the leather pouch and walked into another meadow . The wind is pulling the grass back over his tracks . He stands over the red-tailed hawk and smells the air . A circle of red pools beneath his feet , hot and cool at the same time . If it 's clean , he might dry it out . No . Could n't do that . Burgess and his damn rules . Ralph smiles , slowly moving his hand over the dead body . The bird almost breathes . The brown feathers graze his skin so softly lying somewhat damp against the body . Just a few minutes ago , they surrounded the same soft body climbing the sky . He lifts the body and smells the back of the head . <p> Burgess lets Ralph hunt small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's good practice , " he tells them . Willy just watches . He does n't like killing . He does n't like the smell of it . After a good run , Ralph will skin the rabbits in the kitchen sink . One cut empties most of the inner organs in a single pile . Burgess looks forward to the stew the boys throw together . The flavor of potatoes and meat cooked over a slow flame tastes strong and fresh , like it 's supposed to taste . <p> Ralph did n't get to study much . He was sixteen last year in the 10th grade and meant to graduate until he was caught with a young girl . The high-school principal , and the sheriff , Mr. Wilshire , came to the house and talked to Burgess , and Ralph never went back to school after that . He found a job at the Mobil station in town , changing automobile fluids and filters . Learning the trade , mostly . He smelled of gasoline and car exhaust when he got home . Odd-shaped oil patches on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the tub and scrubbed himself with the clothes brush . His room was the straightest room in the house . Nothing out of place . Burgess laughed at him for it , for his peculiar ways . <p> Ralph stands over the wrought iron bed in Willy 's room , clicking his teeth , a cigarette in his left hand . Willy sleeps , clutching the end of the sheet . His lungs still cold and wet from the run through the forest , rale quietly . He smells Ralph 's cigarette curl into his nose like a girl 's hand . Then he jumps up and rubs his ear . " What is it ? " <p> " Get dressed . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Shut up , you little fuck . You ran out on me . I hate that . You know I hate that ! " <p> " But you shot a red-tail . Burgess said , never shoot a red-tail . " <p> Ralph grins . " Fuck , Burgess . He 'll never know unless you tell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get some clothes on . We 're going for a walk . " <p> " Where ? " <p> Ralph gestures for him to be quiet . Smiling , he holds him against his chest and whispers , " Just get dressed . " <p> Willy hurries , except he ca n't find any socks . If his feet are cold , he 's cold . If he 's cold his chest tightens and he ca n't breathe . He looks under the bed . Ralph jerks him into the hall . <p> " Stop stalling . " <p> " I 'm not . I 'm looking for a sock . " <p> Ralph grips the back of the boy 's arm . Willy feels a band wrap around his neck . He ca n't breathe as a trail of smoke sputters into his lungs . Ralph holds him , staring at his brother . <p> Willy mumbles , " I need a sock . " <p> " Get your shoes on . We 're going for a walk . " <p> Willy shouts , " Burgess is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back with my stuff . I need to wait for him . " <p> Ralph loosens his hold . " Willy 's stuff . Always about you . Well , maybe he 's not . What then ? " <p> " Of course he 's coming . " <p> Ralph looks at Willy hard . " You 're nothing but trouble for me . Let 's go . " <p> Willy grabs his knapsack as they fall out the front door . Ralph , lumbering ahead , lets go of his brother 's arm and moves steadily toward the ridge . He looks back from time to time , gesturing with his arm for Willy to hurry up . Willy is in no hurry . He can hear the small birds on the ridge . A male cardinal stands on a branch in front of him . Run , Willy . He stops to pick mushrooms and puts them in his knapsack . A run of wild blueberries catch his attention , and he piles patches of the crushed berries into his mouth . They smell like pie , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't see Ralph behind him . <p> " We do n't have time for a picnic . " <p> The five miles of pine trees , wild birds , and red-tail hawks high above the crest of green , bear tracks and trees cut by lightning witness the two brothers marching to the ridge in army formation . They stop at the peak , where three stone caves crown the ridge . One , large-mouthed , dead ends quickly into a cold , wet loop of spider webs ; the other two , smaller at the mouth , trail long and deep into the mountain . <p> Ralph lifts his brother in the air and carries him into the large-mouthed cave . <p> " Put me down ! " <p> The smell of animal urine and old nests is hanging along the walls . He drops Willy in front of a small boulder at the end of the cave . The ceiling curves from side to side creating a cathedral setting of shadows and dark moist light as Ralph scurries along the back edge of the cave , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides his hands beneath a narrow shelf carved into the back by Neolithic ice and wind . There , a spool of rope and a few tools he left are lying behind idly . <p> Willy asks , " What are you going to do ? " <p> " You should of thought of that when you run on me . " <p> He struggles to get up . Ralph smacks him across the head , and Willy falls back against the boulder , his mouth tasting the damp floor . He watches his dark-haired brother rush to tie him to the rock . <p> " Do n't Ralph . Do n't do this . Pa will kill you for sure . " <p> " He 's not here , is he ? " <p> Ralph forces the twine around Willy 's chest around the rock , around his younger brother 's arms back around the rock , and then roughly squares a knot behind the wrists . He rubs his hands on his pants , wiping off the spider dust and sour bear smells . <p> There he leaves him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates the feel of the hardness of the rock and the yellow-eyed mountain lions , the smell of ash and smoke , the taste of fire in his throat . He sees a bent metal stake at his feet and laughs , throwing it over the rocks below . The wind , brass and frigid , winds around his face . He hears Willy shouting something from the cave and twists , running into the woods at the foot of the ridge . The throaty ka-kaw , ka-kaw of a band of crows flying overhead follows him until he disappears behind the pine trees and green moss . <p> Two miles deep , Ralph feels hot and dry ; the sun pouring through the trees smells like the inside of a room without windows . He 's running loose in an old section of the forest Burgess used to work in . Burgess liked to trap bears and whatever else fell in for their pelts and meat . At first , the two boys would sit in a tree , playing , while Burgess dug the holes ; he covered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover a ditch so good it was impossible to tell where the cover ended and the forest trail began . Eventually they helped him widen a few of the bear traps . They all worked the shovels till the backs of their necks hurt . They shoveled until they were told not to , Burgess walking around checking the depth and six.e of the head while the boys looked on . <p> Even though Ralph stares hard at the trail , sure he can tell where one of his daddy 's old traps are , he falls in anyway , crashing through the mass of tree branches and torn brush . Years of accumulated forest debris knock his body from side to side , root heads bite into his shins and ankles , as he drops to the bottom . Burgess , you fuck . You got me , anyway . Stunned , he lies motionless . It hurts to breathe . Something must be broken . Working to get his bearing , Ralph knows he has to pull himself out before dark . He touches his leg . Just behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to his calf bleeds into his hands . He wonders what to do , because no one is going to get him out . No one 's coming to this end of the woods . He 'd better think of something . <p> Inside the cave Willy opens and closes both hands , each time stretching the twine a little more . Burgess taught him that . I wish you were here , pa . The heat from his sweat softens the threads as he pushes against it . Drops of perspiration slide from his forehead into his mouth . He shakes his head flipping the sweat from his eyes . After an hour , he can squeeze one hand through , then the other . Just enough . Pushing himself away from the rock , he gets up and runs across the ridge , down toward the trees . He stops and looks back at the cave , still smelling the dark interior and animal smells . He rushes forward into the field of evergreen . <p> Ralph has torn his pants and used the cloth strips around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He closes his eyes , banging the back of his head again and again . Damp and cold . You got me , Burgess . <p> Willy avoids the main path , just in case . Slow down , boy . He runs the back trail . Ever since Burgess stopped trapping bears , no one bothers to use it ' cause it takes too long to get from the campsite on the ridge back to the house . He remembers to walk behind the larger trees not between them . Willy finds a path of wild berries and lies down in the moss . He has nearly fallen asleep when he hears a strange sound . It 's not a bird , more like someone 's moaning . Soon , he has drawn closer to the mouth of the trap . Dropping to the ground , he crawls to the edge of the hole when he hears his brother . Run , Willy . It 's Ralph . <p> Willy runs , jubilant and scared , running from the ridge , from the yelling , from his brother 's fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he left me . Who cares if he dies ? Burgess will know . Burgess cares . <p> A family of large crows swoops down , cawing through the trees . His breathing narrows . I ca n't leave him . He 's my brother . <p> He talks to himself some more before he stops and turns around , trailing back to the ridge , snatching the twine from the cave , talking to himself about his daddy 's long-winded discussions on life , on family , their crazy family . Dragging the twine behind him he falls to the edge of the trap and calls to his brother , " Ralph , can you hear me ? " Maybe he 's dead already . <p> " Ralph . " Nothing . He must be dead . <p> " Ralph ? Are you there ? " <p> A long silence follows before Ralph rattles , " Of course I 'm here , you idiot . " <p> Willy recoils . " I should leave you here . " <p> " Do n't leave me Willy . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can move my toes . " <p> On the way back to the house Ralph leans into Willy on one side and onto a walking stick on the other side so the weight falls on Ralph 's good foot . They follow an old cow path . Wild daisies white and pale yellow color their way . Ralph groans from the open wound , his leg swollen and red , the red-tail crushed under his back in the pit . <p> Willy keeps talking . " We 'll be home soon and Burgess will know what to do . He 'll fix your leg . He can fix most anything . " <p> Ralph does n't answer . He looks ahead and sees the house , the white porch curved around the front . <p> " Let 's make that stew for him . " <p> " What for ? We do n't know when he 's coming back ? " <p> The next morning Willy notices the barn doors where Burgess keeps his red truck are half open like someone is inside doing some work . He strolls over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rain and sun . The wind plays with one of the doors squeaking it open some more . An unpleasant smell roars out from the barn as Willy walks inside . He sees the truck , sees Burgess , his face folded against the steering wheel . <p> Outside , the night falls , the pond frogs bellow to one another and the wind blows in from the west . He walks back to the house . Smells of cow and summer overwhelm him and the clouds dropping from the sky smell of lavender . It feels like rain . <p> By Ann Minoff <p>
