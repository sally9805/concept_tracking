Section : FEATURES <p> For this article , records of the Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance ( HSEES ) system were reviewed to identify and describe acute , unplanned releases of agricultural chemicals and associated injuries related to aerial application during 1995-2002 . Records of aerial-application accidents from the National Transportation Safety Board were also reviewed . Of the 54,090 events in the HSEES system for 1995-2002 , 91 were identified as aerial-application events . The most commonly released substance was malathion . There were 56 victims ; 12 died , and 34 required treatment at a hospital . A higher percentage of HSEES aerial-applicator events involved injury and death than did other HSEES transportation events . The relatively high number of injuries and fatalities underscores the need for precautions such as monitoring and limiting pilot cumulative exposures to pesticides , and using appropriate personal protective equipment and decontamination equipment . Emergency responders should be educated about the hazards associated with chemicals at aerial-application crash sites . Introduction <p> Aerial application is an efficient means of targeting chemical application to increase crop production . Aerial-application pilots , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other industries ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC , 2004 ; Suarez , 2000 ) . Along with the risk of aircraft crash , there is an added risk of exposure to hazardous substances . Unplanned or uncontrolled releases of pesticides or other hazardous substances may occur during any phase of the aerial-application process , including mixing and loading of chemicals into the aircraft , application of the chemicals , and servicing of the aircraft ( Minnesota Department of Agriculture MDA , 2000 ; University of Nebraska , 1996 ) . Accidental releases can affect not only agricultural chemical-application workers , but also others entering the area . For this report , data from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 's ( ATSDR 's ) Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance ( HSEES ) system were analyzed to 1 ) describe the number and type of unintended acute releases of hazardous substances associated with aerial application during 1995-2002 , 2 ) describe associated human health consequences , and 3 ) review measures to reduce releases and associated injuries . Data from the National Transportation Safety Board ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Methods <p> Seventeen state health departments participated in the USEES system during 1995-2002 . Alabama . Colorado , Iowa , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , New York , North Carolina . Oregon , Texas , Washington , and Wisconsin participated for the entire period . Five states participated for part of this period : Louisiana ( 2001-2002 ) , New Hampshire ( 1995-1996 ) , New Jersey ( 2000-2002 ) , Rhode Island ( 1995-2001 ) , and Utah ( 2000-2002 ) . Participating states collected data from a variety sources , such as state and local emergency responders , environmental and health agencies , poison control centers , hospitals , and the news media . <p> An HSEES event is an uncontrolled , illegal , or threatened release of a hazardous substance that requires removal , cleanup , or neutralization according to federal , state , or local law . A hazardous substance is one that can be reasonably expected to cause an adverse health effect . Events involving only a threatened release were included if the threat of release resulted in an action to protect public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded . Victims were defined as any person sustaining at least one symptom , such as eye irritation , in conjunction with the hazardous substance release . <p> Data specifically attributed to aerial-application accidents in the National Transportation Safety Board 's ( NTSB 's ) Aviation Accident Database were also reviewed for 1995-2002 for states participating in HSEES . By NTSB definition , these accidents involved substantial damage to the aircraft or injury to those in the aircraft , but did not necessarily involve release of hazardous substances . Reporting of crashes or injuries to NTSB is mandatory . Results and Discussion <p> During 1995-2002 , 54,090 events were recorded in the HSEES system . Ninety-one events , including one threatened release , involved aerial application . The number of aerial-application events was relatively constant from 1995 to 2000 , but the number decreased in 2001 and 2002 ( Figure 1 ) . Three hundred and fifty NTSB aerial-application accidents were identified for the corresponding HSEHS states . The number of these accidents per year also appears to be decreasing , with 39 to 54 per year for 1995-2000 and 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were similar for the HSEES data and the NTSB data ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 ) . Most HSEES and NTSB events occurred during May to September . Most of the 81 HSEES events for which the time was known occurred in the morning ( nine events per hour between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m . ) . Most of the 350 NTSB accidents also occurred in the morning , with a peak of 38 events between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. ( not shown ) . <p> HSEES data and NTSB data differed in geographic distribution ( Table 1 ) . The highest numbers of HSEES events were in Minnesota and Wisconsin ( 25 and 14 events , respectively ) . The highest number of injuries in HSEES events was reported for Washington ( 16 ) , with the most fatalities in Texas ( 4 ) ( Table 1 ) . NTSB data showed more aerial-applicator accidents in Texas ( 108 ) , followed by Mississippi ( 56 ) . The highest number of injuries in NTSB accidents was in Texas ( 43 ) , which also had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reasons for differences in distribution of events between HSEES and NTSB are not known ; differences in reporting may be a factor ( NTSB reporting is mandatory , and HSEES reporting is not ) , as may be differences in case definitions ( e.g. , NTSB events include all crashes with substantial damage and injuries but may not involve releases , or may involve petroleum-only releases ) . <p> The method of chemical release in HSEES events was most commonly reported as spill ( 58 spills ) or spill with air release ( 14 spills with air releases ) . Eighty-nine events involved release of at least one pesticide . Malathion , released in 21 events , was the most commonly released substance ; **25;3640;TOOLONG acid ( 2 , 4-D ) was the second most common ( 8 events ) . Altogether . 16 events involved the release of organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors or n-methyl carbonate cholinesterase inhibitors ( carbofuran , carbaryl , methomyl ) . Aircraft fuel ( including diesel , gasoline , kerosene , and unspecified fuel ) was released in 13 of the events . Because petroleum releases alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft fuel were always reported in conjunction with releases of another agricultural chemical . The quantity released , reported for 77 events , ranged from 1 gallon to 3,000 gallons , with a median of 55 gallons . <p> Thirty-nine of the 91 HSEES aerial-application events had 56 victims , including 12 fatalities ( Table 2 ) . Trauma was reported for all victims with fatal injuries , although two of these victims also had thermal burns . Most injuries were sustained by pilots , often during a crash , but some injuries were received by others on the ground in the application area . In 2002 , eight injuries were reported as due to overspray or misapplication , which is more than in 1995-2001 ( range : 0 per year to 5 per year ) . This increase may he due to an increase in the actual number of overspray events , or it could represent better surveillance . <p> Responders to a crash scene may also be affected by chemicals released during an aerial-application emergency ( e.g. , police officers , as noted in Table 2 ) . Chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to several hundred feet away from an actual crash site , injuring people on the ground . Even properly applied chemicals could pose a risk to responders. accident investigators , or others several hours after application it protective equipment is not worn . This possibility is suggested by a report of hospital workers being affected by treating people contaminated with malathion ( Horton . Berkowitz , &; Kaye , 2003 . ) <p> The proportion of injuries from aerial-application releases is higher than for other HSEES transportation-related events . About 5 percent ( 1,032 of 21,927 ) of HSEES transportation-related events from 1995-2002 involved victims , while about 45 percent ( 39 of 86 ) of aerial-application events involved victims ( five of the 91 events were not coded for transportation ) . Death was more likely to occur in aerial-application events : 28 percent ( 11 of 39 ) of HSEES aerial-application events with victims involved fatalities , while 9 percent ( 95 of 1,032 ) of all other HSEES transportation-related events with victims involved a fatality . <p> Aerial application involves a number of potential hazards , including adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space for maneuvering , and flight path obstacles ( CDC , 2004 ; University of Nebraska , 1996 ) . In addition , some studies have suggested that pilot exposure to chemicals , especially those containing nervous-system toxicants , such as organophosphates and carbamate pesticide inhibitors of cholinesterase , has been a factor in aerial-applicator crashes ( Driskell , Groce , Hill , &; Birky , 1991 ; Quantick &; Perry , 1981 ; Reich &; Berner , 1968 ; Richter , Gordon , Halamish , &; Gribetz , 1981 ) . <p> This review is limited because reporting to the HSEES system is not mandated by all participating states , a circumstance that may result in underreporting of qualifying events ; furthermore , the findings represent only HSEES-participating states and may not accurately reflect events or conditions in nonparticipating states . Conclusion <p> Data from 2001 and 2002 suggest that the number of applicator incidents ( but not victims ) may be declining . Aerial application involves relatively high risks for injury from trauma or chemical exposure for pilots , ground workers , responders , and passers-by . General acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Safety precautions include providing showers or other decontamination equipment near application sites . providing proper personal protective equipment and training for site workers , providing proper equipment and training in pesticide hazards for community first responders or accident investigators , posting warnings in areas where pesticide application is occurring to reduce risk to passers-by , and limiting pilot exposures to pesticides : Ground crews , not pilots , should mix and load chemicals . Pilots should be protected from pesticides during application by use of closed cockpits or by wearing respirators , and should avoid flying through airborne pesticides ( University of Nebraska . 1996 ) . The pilots ' cholinesterase levels could also be tested before application of organophosphates or carbamates. and levels could be monitored periodically thereafter to identify potential poisoning ( Quantick &; Perry , 1981 ; Reich &; Herner , 1968 ) , as has been required for agricultural workers in California . <p> Disclaimer and Acknowledgements : This report is supported by funds from the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) trust fund and the Office of Terrorism Preparedness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CDC ) , provided to the Minnesota Department of Health under a cooperative agreement by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ATSDR ) , Public Health Service , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
