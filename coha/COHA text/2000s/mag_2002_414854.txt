Antibody drugs were declared dead ten years ago . Now they 're biotech 's hot new thing . In this new world of often unbridled pessimism , it 's worth noting that nobody ever guaranteed you could make a living , let alone a good one , by pushing the limits of technology . <p> Take Nils Lonberg , for instance . Lonberg compares his company 's story to Sleeping Beauty 's , but his analogy is not precise . Sleeping Beauty , after all , was lucky enough to sleep through her ordeal . Lonberg and his colleagues were wide awake through theirs . <p> Lonberg was just a few years out of graduate school in 1989 when he signed on with GenPharm International , a company developing a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies-souped-up versions of the proteins produced by the immune system to fight disease . The goal was to genetically engineer a mouse with a human immune system , one that could be used to generate " fully human " monoclonal antibodies . <p> His timing could hardly have been worse . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer to severe infections were about to turn out to be high-profile failures . One of these , a drug called Centoxin , made by Malvern , PA-based Centocor , was projected to earn billions as a treatment for often fatal septic shock before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve its use in 1992 . The FDA decision marked the seeming demise of monoclonal antibodies and , at least for a while , of the prospects of the entire biotech industry . <p> " The short story , " says Lonberg , " is we hunkered down . " The longer story , like Sleeping Beauty 's , does have a happy ending . In the past four years , Princeton , NJ-based Medarex , which purchased GenPharm in 1997 , has blossomed . The monoclonal-antibody business now has some 300 employees , a brand new research facility in Milpitas , CA , and 60 hectares in New Jersey where it 's building a huge development center . It also has a half-billion dollars in cash to make ends meet while it develops its technology and its drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonberg , who is now senior vice president and scientific director of Medarex . <p> The same can be said for monoclonal antibodies in general , which are in the midst of a remarkable revival . Technologies to make monoclonal antibodies have finally come of age , and the drugs themselves are being touted once again as potential cures or treatments for the entire spectrum of human illness . <p> Since 1997 , the FDA has approved 10 monoclonal-antibody drugs-constituting a quarter of all biotech drugs on the market-with combined sales of well over a billion dollars a year . And perhaps more telling , one in every five biotech medicines in development is a monoclonal antibody . Even biotech giant Genentech , a South San Francisco , CA , company founded with the goal of producing enzyme and hormone drugs , now finds monoclonal antibodies filling half its development pipeline . <p> Indeed , the story of monoclonal antibodies is more than a fairy tale ; it 's a lesson in the values of persistence and patience . " When we started with monoclonal antibodies ten years ago , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , did n't work , ' " says Paul Carter , a researcher with Seattle-based Immunex who helped launch Genentech 's monoclonal-antibody research in 1990 . " Now , everybody and their dog wants to get into antibodies . " FOREIGN INVADERS <p> As monoclonal antibodies make a comeback , nobody 's claiming miracle cures anymore . Having passed through the cycle of " Holy Grail to dirty word , " says Lehman Brothers biotech analyst Rachel Leheny , monoclonal antibodies have become a working technology with an established set of strengths and weaknesses . <p> Monoclonal antibodies are designed by the immune system to bind only to specific target molecules , making them much more precise than typical small-molecule drugs , the relatively simple compounds that have been the staple of the pharmaceutical industry . And unlike other protein therapeutics , which can activate or block only one specific biological process each , monoclonal antibodies can be developed for any target protein or cell type imaginable . This combination of built-in precision and flexibility can mean faster development and lower toxicity . The risk of a potential antibody drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably less than it is for small molecules . <p> " The probability of success is much higher , and the time course of developing them is much quicker , " says Geoff Davis , chief scientific officer at Abgenix , a Fremont , CA-based antibody drug company . Considering that pharmaceutical companies now spend an average of 15 years and $800 million to bring a new drug to market , saving a few years in development and reducing the risk of a drug 's failing in clinical trials can translate into an enormous profit . <p> The latest boost to the monoclonal-antibody revival comes from the sequencing of the human genome and the burgeoning genomics industry . Suddenly , pharmaceutical and biotech researchers are deluged with genes , tens of thousands of them , many of which may be valuable drug targets . The result is a gold rush mentality , as researchers race to establish which of these genes and their accompanying proteins are the best targets for inhibiting disease processes . Here monoclonal antibodies-in the guise of laboratory tools that will bind to specific proteins and knock them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those questions . And once a viable target is nailed down , the low risk and precise targeting of monoclonals can make them the easiest drugs to get to market against it . " They cut right to the chase , " says Immunex 's Carter . <p> The object of the pursuit , the antibodies themselves , are Y-shaped proteins that constitute the immune system 's first line of defense . They will bind to anything the immune system finds unfamiliar and hence potentially dangerous-say a bacterium or virus-and then hold on tight , calling forth the full range of the immune system 's forces to neutralize or destroy the target ( see " Mobilizing Immunity , " p. 60 ) . <p> Over the course of a lifetime , the human body generates roughly 100 billion different antibodies . In each case , the base of the Y is virtually identical ; the arms of the Y differ from antibody to antibody , thus providing the vast variability that maximizes the possibility that the immune system will spot almost any conceivable invader . <p> Researchers have long envisioned inducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either ignores , such as cancer , or causes , like rheumatoid arthritis , lupus and other autoimmune diseases . Biologists have known for decades that if you immunize a mouse with a human cancer cell , or even a single protein from such a cell , the mouse will respond by generating its own antibodies to fight the foreigner off-in effect , an anticancer antibody . If you inject the same cancer cell over and over and over again , your mouse will generate antibodies exquisitely specialized to target the cancer cells you put in . ADVERSE REACTIONS <p> It was back in 1975 that Csar Milstein and Georges Khler , immunologists at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , England , developed a technology to mass-produce such antibodies and , in the process , launched an industry . Khler and Milstein fused the antibody-producing cells from mice-known as B lymphocytes-with tumor cells that would keep those B cells alive forever in a laboratory . <p> In the body , immature B cells reside in the bone marrow and contain a full complement of the gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and migrate into the bloodstream , the segments undergo rearrangement so that each mature B cell makes just one type of antibody-a monoclonal antibody ( see " Genes to Antibodies , " p. 62 ) . Each of Khler and Milstein 's cell lines would pump out an uninterrupted supply of a single monoclonal antibody , depending on the B cell it arose from . In 1984 , their discovery earned the pair a share of the Nobel Prize in medicine , by which time there were roughly a thousand companies trying to cash in on the technology . Most of them would fail . <p> The problem was inherent in the antibody sources available at the time . Antibodies could be obtained by immunizing mice , as with Raritan , NJ-based Ortho Biotech 's Orthoclone , designed to fight organ transplant rejection and the first antibody drug approved by the FDA . ( Ortho Biotech has been a Johnson and Johnson subsidiary since 1990 . ) Or they could be harvested directly from the human victims of a particular disease , as with Centocor 's Centoxin . <p> The catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The human immune system still considers them foreign and does its best to fight them off-a response known as the " human antimouse antibody " response , which not only destroys the antibodies but can lead to kidney failure and death . <p> When Orthoclone came on the market in 1986 , the pharmaceutical industry suddenly learned just how bad the response could be . While most recipients were fine ( and , in fact , Orthoclone is still in use ) , some patients had severe reactions . " Here was a drug that was specifically designed to suppress the immune system , and you still got a strong response , " says Lonberg . <p> As for antibodies harvested directly from human patients , they simply do n't bind to their targets tightly enough to stem disease-or at least that was the case with Centoxin , and the reason its highly publicized clinical trials failed . <p> Centoxin 's failure , says Lonberg , " caused everyone , at least on Wall Street and big pharma , to throw up their hands in despair with antibodies and walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilly had purchased Hybritech , the original monoclonal-antibody company , in 1986 for nearly $500 million . After building Hybritech up to 1,400 employees , Lilly sold the company in 1995 , post-Centoxin , for only a fraction of what it paid for it . GETTING HEALTHY <p> By then , however , salvation was already on the way . It arrived in the guise of antibodies that were considerably less mouse and increasingly human in origin and function . Researchers had begun developing methods to create these blends in the mid-1980s , and the technologies were just beginning to bear fruit around the time Lilly gave up on Hybritech . Chimeric antibodies came first , constructed back in 1984 by joining the gene that generates the constant region of a human antibody , the base of the Y , to the genes that generate the variable regions of mouse antibodies , the outer arms of the Y. The resulting chimera is about a third mouse and two-thirds human . It still binds tightly to the target for which it was designed , while avoiding the bulk of the human antimouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were humanized antibodies . Whereas chimerics were one-third mouse , humanized antibodies were less than a tenth . From the mouse came only the very tips of the arms of the antibody Y , just that part of the variable region that binds directly to its target . All the rest was human . But there was a problem : when the tips of a mouse antibody were genetically grafted onto a human framework , the antibody was often unable to grip its target tightly enough . <p> Cary Queen , a mathematician turned biologist then working at the National Institutes of Health , created an algorithm to analyze the fit between mouse tips and human framework and then figure out just which molecules in the human framework would have to be adjusted , and by how much , to leave the mouse region sitting comfortably atop the arms of the Y and binding tightly to its target . Queen patented the technology and cofounded Fremont , CA-based Protein Design Labs in 1986 to humanize antibodies for its own drug business and for anyone else who might employ its services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it to market , and the industry revival took off . In 1994 , the FDA approved the first monoclonal-antibody drug since 1986 , Centocor 's chimeric-antibody drug to inhibit clotting following cardiovascular surgery . ( Johnson and Johnson acquired Centocor in 1999 . ) The agency then approved three more monoclonal-antibody drugs in 1997-including San Diego-based Idec Pharmaceuticals and Genentech 's chimeric Rituxan for non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . <p> Rituxan and Genentech 's humanized Herceptin , approved the following year for breast cancer , may alone have pushed the antibody business back into the boom phase , simply because they were anticancer therapies and so fulfilled , at least modestly , one aspect of the mid-1980s hype . In any case , approval for five more monoclonal antibodies followed in 1998 , and four more since . At the moment , nearly 50 humanized antibodies are in clinical trials , targeting the full spectrum of human diseases from psoriasis to heart disease and cancer . GOATS CURE <p> But that 's just the beginning , as " fully human " antibodies are now hitting the pharmaceutical pipelines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , researchers remove the full complement of antibody genes from human B cells and transplant them into bacteria-specific viruses known as " phages . " The viruses promptly generate the appropriate antibodies from the newly acquired genes and then " display " the antibodies on their surfaces-one antibody per phage . <p> " Now we put all those phages into a test tube , " explains David Chiswell , cofounder of Cambridge Antibody Technology in Cambridge , England . " Anytime we want antibodies to a particular target , we essentially dip the target into the test tube-which can be thought of as a library of antibodies-and hook out just that subset of 100 billion antibodies that happens to bind specifically to the target . " <p> Method number two is the transgenic mouse with a human immune system-Lonberg 's original dream at Medarex , also pursued by competitor Abgenix . Put a target molecule into such a mouse , and you 'll get a human antibody out-no human antimouse antibody response to worry about . To make the mice , researchers cloned the gene segments responsible for generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mouse embryonic stem cells and grew the mice to maturity . It was a challenge , says Abgenix 's Davis , " because nobody had ever put that much DNA into a transgenic mouse . " They also had to inactivate the genes that produced mouse antibodies , which they did in another set of mice , and then bred the two lines together . <p> While the transgenic mice are the latest antibody technology to come to market , it 's still an open question whether they 're actually better than any of the other techniques for generating new antibody drugs . " All of these technologies probably produce antibodies that will behave essentially identically when used in people , " says Robert Kirkman , Protein Design Labs ' vice president for business development . " How do you get the best antibody against the given target is the ultimate question . And that is probably not always going to be the same technology . " <p> Whichever technology ultimately rules the field , it 's safe to say that antibodies will play a huge role in genomics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonberg , bringing a monoclonal-antibody drug to market can give pharmaceutical companies a way to tackle diseases while they spend the extra years necessary trying to develop a small molecule that will do the same task . <p> Drug makers are pursuing this separate track because monoclonal antibodies still have two serious drawbacks compared to small-molecule drugs . One is that they are large proteins . This means that they have to be given intravenously rather than in pill form , so they wo n't be chewed up in the digestive system-although researchers hope to soon solve that problem . ( The flip side is that they last considerably longer in the human body , which means they can be administered perhaps once a month rather than once a day . ) And the second is that they 're expensive to produce . <p> None of the methods used to generate chimeric , humanized or fully human antibodies can produce antibodies in commercial quantities . At the moment , companies are making antibody drugs by first inserting the gene for a specific antibody into cells culled from hamster ovaries and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a fermentation process not unlike that used to make beer . <p> The cells in each vat then secrete a single type of antibody that can be harvested from the surrounding fluid every few months . The process is expensive , however , so researchers have been pursuing dramatic biotech solutions to accomplish the same task . In particular , they 're creating genetically engineered fruits and vegetables-say corn , alfalfa or bananas-loaded with the desired antibodies , or even transgenic animals to serve as living monoclonal-antibody factories . <p> Somewhere in central Massachusetts is a " biopharm production facility " built by Genzyme Transgenics . While the company does not like to say exactly where it is , it says that it looks a lot like any other farm-except for the 2,000 or so resident goats that have been genetically engineered with human genes to express monoclonal antibodies or other large-protein drugs in their milk . <p> According to Jack Green , Genzyme Transgenics ' chief financial officer , a few monoclonal-producing goats lactating for a year can match the productivity of an entire fermentation vat of hamster cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a drug suddenly has a bigger market than anticipated , you do n't have to finance a whole new vat at the cost of a few hundred million dollars : you just breed more goats . " The generation time for a new goat is seven months to sexual maturity , " says Green , " so in a year you can Get to however many goats and whatever scale of production you desire . " <p> After a quarter-century of struggle , monoclonal antibodies have survived to become a mature and exciting technology . And the skeptics are long gone . The question now is how much of 21st-century medicine will be dominated by these remarkable molecules . " Suddenly all this looks real , " Lonberg says . " Monoclonal antibodies are no longer somebody 's fantasy . " Antibodies on the Attack TABLE <p> DIAGRAM : Genes to Antibodies : Antibodies are the product of two genes , a " heavy chain " and a " light chain .
