Near Sidi Mansour , Tunisia 1530 7 April 1943 A solitary Afrika Korps staff car - a small Mercedes convertible sedan - moved as quickly as it could across the desert . It had of course been painted in the Afrika Korps desert scheme : tan paint mimicked the color of the Tunisian desert , and crooked black lines on the hood and doors were intended to break up the form of the vehicle and make it harder to spot at a distance . Nothing could be done , however , to keep the dust of the Tunisian desert road from boiling up beneath the wheels of the Mercedes and raising a cloud scores of feet into the air . If anyone was looking , the dust cloud formed an arrow pointing to the Mercedes . And someone was looking - an American pilot in a P-51 Mustang . The North American P51-C and -D aircraft used in the North African campaign were powered by a Packard version of the British Merlin engine . They had a top speed of 440 knots , and were armed with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of droppable auxiliary fuel tanks and could also be used to carry 1,000-pound bombs . Even at 500 feet and an indicated airspeed of 325 knots , it had n't been hard for Captain Archer C. Dooley , Jr. , U.S. Army Air Corps , to spot the boiling dust and then the Afrika Korps staff car that had caused it . " Oh , shit ! " Captain Archer Dooley , Jr. , said sadly . Finding a Kraut staff car running unprotected across the desert did not please him . When young Archie Dooley first signed up to fly fighter aircraft , he expected to become a " Knight of the Sky " - flying mano a mano against other knights of the sky . He did n't expect to be killing people like cockroaches . Fifteen months before , Archie Dooley had been the valedictorian of the 1942 class at St. Ignatius High School in Kansas City , Kansas . Six weeks before , he had been Second Lieutenant Dooley . He had come to Tunisia fresh from fighter school , looking forward to sweeping Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wings of his Mustang , much as Errol Flynn had swept the Dirty Hun from the skies over France in World War I in Dawn Patrol . After which , with a little bit of luck , there would be a girl in the Officers ' Club with an exciting French accent , long legs , long hair , and firm breasts , who would express her admiration for a Knight of the Sky in a carnal fashion . It had n't turned out that way . For one thing , by the time Archie got to the squadron , the Allies had attained air superiority over the enemy . In other words , no German or Italian aircraft were left to be swept from the skies . The day Archie reported in , the squadron commander had informed him that the 23rd Fighter Group had ordered the squadron to be engaged in ground support . That broke down into two missions : The first was to attack the enemy in front of American infantry and armor with either wing-mounted bombs or the .50-caliber Brownings . The second was reconnaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what you could see , and to interdict - which meant to shoot up - anything you found . Second Lieutenant Archer Dooley , Jr . ' s , first mission had been to fly wingman to the squadron commander on a two-plane reconnaissance and interdiction mission . At first , that had been sort of exciting . . . even fun . They had raced across the desert close to the ground at better than 300 knots , a maneuver flatly forbidden in flight school . Here it was perfectly acceptable . Like drinking in the Officers ' Club , even if you were a long way from being old enough to vote . They had come across a railroad engine , puffing along tracks in the desert , dragging a line of boxcars . The squadron commander had signaled to Archie that they should engage the target . " Take the locomotive , " he had ordered . " I 'll get the boxcars . " Second Lieutenant Archer Dooley , Jr. , had gotten the locomotive , enjoying the sight of his one-tracer-round-in-five stream of .50-caliber projectiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mustang 's nose just a hair - moving into the locomotive 's boiler . As he flashed over the locomotive , the locomotive had blown up . His first kill . Then there was a ball of fire , from which rose a dense black cloud of smoke . As Archie pulled up to make a second run at the train , he realized that the ball of fire was several hundred yards from the railroad tracks . What else had they hit , he wondered , even by mistake , that had exploded like that ? Then , as he lowered the Mustang 's nose for his second run , taking care not to collide with the squadron commander 's Mustang , he realized that the squadron commander 's Mustang was no longer in sight . And then he realized what the ball of fire really was . At the time , it seemed probable that the squadron commander had been hit by ground fire . The squadron commander had told him that some of the trains were armed with antiaircraft machine guns and light cannon , mounted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive , Archie had n't noticed anything on the cars behind it . That night , at the Officers ' Club ( empty , as always , of females - long-legged , firm-breasted , or otherwise ) , he learned about the Group 's promotion policies : Everybody got to be a first lieutenant after eighteen months of commissioned service , which meant he had about ten days before that happened . There were two ways to get to be a captain . If you lived to serve twelve months as a first lieutenant , then promotion was automatic . But promotion came a lot quicker in another circumstance . The senior first lieutenant was the squadron executive officer ( senior , that is , in terms of length of service in the squadron , not date of rank ) . If the squadron commander got either killed or seriously injured ( defined as having to spend thirty days or more in the hospital ) , then the Exec took the Old Man 's job and got the captain 's railroad tracks that went with it . Four weeks and six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sergeant handed him a sheet of paper to sign : Headquarters 4032nd Fighter Squadron 23rd Fighter Group In The Field 2 March 1943 The undersigned herewith assumes command . Archer Dooley , Jr . Archer Dooley , Jr . Capt . USAAC File 201 Dooley , Archer , Jr . 0378654 Copy to CO , 23rd Fighter Group He had n't gotten to work his way up to executive officer . The young man who had become the Old Man and the Exec had both gone in on the same day , the Old Man when his Mustang ran into a Kraut antiaircraft position that had gotten lucky , and the Exec when he banked too steep , too low to the ground and put a wing into the desert . That left Archie as the senior first lieutenant in the squadron . The colonel had driven over from Group in a jeep , told him to cut orders assuming command , and handed him two sets of railroad tracks , still in cellophane envelopes from the quartermaster officer 's sales store . Archie had pinned one set of captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars still sewn to the epaulets of his A-2 horsehide flight jacket , and put the other set in the drawer of the squadron commander 's - now his - desk . If he ever had to go someplace , like Group , he would pin the extras on his Class A uniform then . Being a captain and a squadron commander was not at all like what he 'd imagined . A lot of really unpleasant shit went with being the Old Man . Like writing letters to the next of kin . He had n't actually had to compose these , thank God . There were letters in the file that some other Old Man had written , full of bullshit about how your **26;552;TOOLONG died instantly and courageously doing his duty , and how much he would be missed by his fellow officers and the enlisted men because he had been such a fine officer and had been an inspiration to all who had been privileged to know him . Not the truth , not about how he 'd tried to bail out but had been too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not that he 'd been seen trying and failing to get out of the cockpit through a sheet of flame blowing back from the engine ; not about how he 'd tried to land his shot-up airplane and blew it , and rolled over and over down the runway in a ball of flame and crushed aluminum . Or that they really did n't know what the fuck had happened to him , he just had n't come back ; and later some tank crew had found the wreckage of his Mustang with him still in the cockpit , the body so badly burned they could n't tell if he had been killed in the air or died when his plane hit . He did n't have to type the letters , either . The first sergeant just took one from the file and retyped it , changing the name . But Archie had to sign it , because he was now the Old Man and that 's what was expected of him . And he was always getting bullshit pep talks from some major or light colonel at Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like what he remembered now , staring down at the Kraut staff car : " Dooley , what interdiction means is that you and your people are supposed to engage whatever you come across , like one fucking Kraut with a rifle , one motorcycle messenger , not pass him by to go looking for a railroad locomotive , or something you think is important , or looks good when you blow it up . The motorcycle messenger is probably carrying an important message . Otherwise he would n't be out there . You take out a Kraut staff car , for example , you 're liable to take out an important Kraut officer . Interdict means everything that 's down there . You read me , Captain ? " " Yes , Sir . " " And pass the word to your people , and make sure they read you , and read you good . " " Yes , Sir . " And Archie had passed the word , and gotten dirty looks . And now there was a Mercedes staff car down there , and it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a dog with your car ; but you had to do it because you had told your people they had to do it , and Archie believed that an officer should not order anybody to do what he would n't do himself . Archie banked his Mustang steep to the right , lined up on the cloud of dust boiling out under the wheels of the Mercedes , and when he thought he had him , closed his finger on the trigger on the joystick . When he saw his tracer stream converge on the Mercedes and he did n't have to correct , he thought he was getting pretty good at this shit . The Mercedes ran off the road , turned over , and burst into flames . Maybe a couple of bodies had flown out of the Mercedes , but Archie could n't be sure , and he did n't go back for a second look , because if he did and saw somebody running , he was n't going to try to get him . He leveled off at about 500 feet and started looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , at Afrika Korps General Hospital #3 , near Carthage , Tunisia , the chief surgeon and hospital commander , Oberst-Arzt ( Colonel-Doctor ) Horst Friederich von und zu Mittlingen , pushed his way through the tent flap of the tent euphemistically called " Operating Theater Three " and reached beneath his bloodstained surgical apron for a package of cigarettes . The hospital 's name implied something far more substantial than the reality . General Hospital #3 ( which served the Tenth Panzer Division ) was a sprawling collection of tents and crude sheds , most of them marked with red crosses to protect against bombing or strafing . The tents served as operating theaters , the sheds as wards . Both were covered with the dust raised by the trucks and ambulances - and sometimes horse-drawn wagons - bringing in the wounded and dying . Von und zu Mittlingen was a fifty-two-year-old Hessian trained at Marburg and Tbingen . Before the war , he had been professor of orthopedic surgery at St. Louise 's Hospital in Munich . The cigarettes were Chesterfields . One of the nurses , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken them from the body of an American pilot who had survived the crash of his fighter plane but had died en route to Afrika Korps General Hospital #3 . The lighter , too , was American , a Zippo , found on the floor of one of the surgical tents . There had been no telling how long it had been there , or to whom it had be-longed , so he kept it . He lit a Chesterfield , inhaled deeply , and felt with his hand behind him for one of the vertical poles holding up the corner of the tent . When he found it , he leaned against it , then exhaled , examining the glow of the cigarette as he did . His hands were shaking . He willed them to be still . It had been time to take a break , to leave the operating theater and step outside into the welcome cold of the night . And to light up a cigarette . And get a cup of coffee , if he could find one . Though patients were still awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself only so far . After so many hours at the table , his eyes did not see well , his fingers lost their skill , and his judgment was clouded by fatigue . What he desperately wanted was a drink . But that would have to wait until later , much later , until there were no more wounded requiring his services . He would probably have to wait until the early morning for that . Then he would take several deep pulls from the neck of his bottle of brandy before falling into bed . He took two more puffs on the Chesterfield , exhaled , and pushed himself away from the tent pole . I will go to the mess and see if there is coffee . I will do nothing for the next ten minutes except smoke my cigarette and drink my coffee and take a piss . His route took him past three tents on the perimeter of the hospital area . A medical team - a physician , a nurse , and stretcher bearers - stood outside the three tents as the ambulances and trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each incoming patient : Those who would most likely die if they did not go under the knife immediately , he ordered to be carried into the first tent , where a team of nurses would prepare them for surgery . As soon as a table was free , they underwent the knife . Those who had a reasonable chance of survival , but could wait a bit for surgery , were given morphine and moved into the second tent . As soon as the really critical patients had received attention , their turn in an operating theater would come . Those who stood little chance of survival were moved into the third tent and given morphine . When everyone in Tent A and Tent B had received treatment , an attempt would be made to save those in Tent C. Oberst-Artz von und zu Mittlingen violated his own rule about never going into Tent C. The sight of dead men , and men in the last - too often agonized - moments of their lives , upset him . He knew it was better to be calm and emotionless when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stretchers in Tent C. The first two were dead . One looked asleep . The second 's face was frozen with his last agony . Von und zu Mittlingen covered their faces with blankets and went to the last man on that side of the tent . He was surprised that he was still alive . His entire head was wrapped in blood-soaked bandages . That implied , at the least , serious trauma to his eyes and probably to his brain . Both of his hands were similarly bandaged , suggesting to von und zu Mittlingen that he would probably lose the use of both hands , and might actually lose the hands themselves . Another heavily blood-soaked bandage was on his upper right leg , and his torso was also bandaged ; but the amount of blood on these last suggested to von und zu Mittlingen that the wounds on his torso were not as serious as the others , though internal bleeding of vital organs was of course possible . It would probably be better if the poor bastard died ; the alternative is living as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Army trousers but an Afrika Korps tunic . That quickly identified him as an officer , someone in a position to ignore the rules forbidding the wearing of any part of the enemy 's uniform . Von und zu Mittlingen reached for the patient 's ID tag . " Who 's that ? " the patient asked , sensing the hand on the tag . " I 'm a doctor . " The tag identified the patient as Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) von Stauffenberg . Oh , my God ! This mutilated body is Claus ! " You 've got yourself in a mess , have n't you , Claus ? " von und zu Mittlingen said . " Who 's that ? " " Horst Mittlingen , Claus , " Horst Friederich von und zu Mittlingen said . " We 're going to take care of you now . " " One of their Mustangs got me , " Oberstleutnant Graf ( Count ) Claus von Stauffenberg said . " Claus , what did they give you for the pain ? " " I decided I would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mittlingen stood up and walked to the flap of the tent and bellowed for stretcher bearers , then returned to the bloody body on the stretcher . " We 'll take care of you now , Claus , " he said . " You 'll be all right . " " Really ? " von Stauffenberg asked mockingly . " Yes , really , " von und zu Mittlingen said . " I am about to violate my own rule about never working on my friends . " Two stretcher bearers appeared . " Put this officer on the next available table , " von und zu Mittlingen ordered . " Tell Sister Wagner I will want her beside me . " " Jawohl , Herr Oberst . " " If I could see , I would say I 'm glad to see you , Horst , " von Stauffen-berg said . On 12 April , the Germans announced the discovery of mass graves in Poland 's Katyn Forest . The graves contained the bodies of 4,100 Polish officers and officer cadets who had been captured by the Soviet army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small-caliber pistols . A week later , after refusing Polish Government in Exile demands for an investigation by the International Red Cross , the Soviet government said the whole thing was German propaganda . On 17 April , in its largest operation to date , the 8th U.S. Air Force attacked aircraft factories in Bremen with 117 B-17 bombers , sixteen of which were shot down . TWO The Office of the Reichsfhrer-SS Berlin 1545 17 April 1943 The interoffice communications device on the ornately carved desk of Reichsfhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler buzzed discreetly . Though he was wearing his customary ornate black uniform , the forty-three-year-old Reichsfhrer 's round spectacles and slight build gave him the look of a low-ranking clerk . It would have been a mistake to act on that assumption . Without taking his eyes from the teletypewriter printout he was reading , Himmler reached for the box and depressed the lever that allowed his secretary , Frau Gertrud Hassler , to communicate . The Reichsfhrer-SS had had the device rigged in that manner . He was a busy man , and could not afford an interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was busy , he simply ignored the buzzing and she would try again later . " Herr Reichsfhrer , " Frau Gertrud Hassler announced . " Herr Korvettenkapitn Boltitz , from Minister von Ribbentrop 's office , is here . " Korvettenkapitn was the German Navy rank equivalent to major . The Reichsfhrer-SS was not busy , but that did not mean he was prepared to be interrupted by the woman every time a messenger arrived in the outer office . " And ? " the Reichsfhrer-SS said impatiently . " He insists that you personally sign for the message , Herr Reichs-fhrer-SS . " " Mein Gott ! Well , show him in , please , Frau Hassler . " Himmler rose from his desk and walked toward the double doors to his office . A moment later , one of them opened ; and a tall , blond young man in civilian clothing stepped inside . In his hand was a briefcase . He raised his arm straight out from the shoulder . " Heil Hitler ! " he barked . Himmler raised his right arm at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Himmler said . " Herr Reichsfhrer , " Boltitz said . " I regret the intrusion on your valuable time , Herr Reichsfhrer , but I was directed to give this to you personally . " Himmler knew that Boltitz 's assignment to the office of Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop meant that he was really Admiral Wilhelm Canaris 's man - read spy - in the Foreign Ministry . Canaris was Director of Abwehr Intelligence . Neither he nor von Ribbentrop was really a member of Adolf Hitler 's inner circle , and Himmler was n't entirely sure either of them could be completely trusted . " I understand , " Himmler said , and put out his hand for the message . Boltitz opened the briefcase and took from it a clipboard , whose clip held an envelope . He removed the envelope , and then handed Himmler the clipboard and a pen . Himmler scrawled his name , acknowledging receipt of the message , and the young man then handed him the envelope . " Thank you , Herr Reichsfhrer . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , sir , but I am at your disposal if you wish to reply . " " Just a moment , please , " Himmler said , then tore open the envelope and read the message . Classification : most urgent Confidentiality : most personal attention of the foreign minister of the German Reich Heil Hitler ! Standartenfhrer-SS Josef Goltz requests that appendix one attached hereto be immediately brought to the attention of Reichsfhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler . Manfred Alois Graf Von Lutzenberger ambassador of the German Reich to the republic of Argentina begin appendix one To : Reichsfhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler From : SS-Standartenfhrer Josef Goltz Subject : operation phoenix , progress report Heil Hitler ! The undersigned has the honor to report to the Herr Reichsfhrer-SS the following : ( 1 ) all arrangements have been made to off-load the special cargo aboard the motor vessel Comerciante del Ocano Pacfico early in the morning of 19 April 1943. ( 2 ) all arrangements have been made to transport and store the special cargo under the highest possible security once it is ashore . ( 3 ) all arrangements have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Graf Spee from their place of internment to Puerto Magdalena on Samborombn bay once the actions described in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above have been accomplished . ( 4 ) the naval officers will first be taken aboard the Ocano Pacfico and then repatriated to the fatherland as space becomes available aboard u-boats returning to European ports . ( 5 ) while the undersigned has assumed personal command of operation phoenix since arriving in Argentina , he wishes to acknowledge the contributions made by ambassador Graf Von Lutzenberger and members of his staff , in particular first secretary Anton Von Gradny-Sawz , military attach Oberst Karl-Heinz Grner and assistant military attach for air major FreIherr Hans-peter Von Wachtstein. their immediate grasp of the importance of operation phoenix and their dedication to the principles of national socialism and the Fhrer has earned my admiration . Respectfully submitted : Josef Luther Goltz Standartenfhrer SS-SD end appendix one end message The Comerciante Ocano Pacfico , a Spanish-flagged merchantman , had been sent to Samborombn Bay in the Argentine section of the River Plate estuary ostensibly with the clandestine mission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , however , its only secret mission . It was also charged with smuggling into Argentina equipment and supplies intended to aid the escape from internment of the crew of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee , which had been scuttled in the harbor of Montevideo , Uruguay , in December 1939 , after a running battle with the Royal Navy . The repatriation of the Graf Spee crew was especially dear to the heart of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris , who had himself escaped internment in Argentina during the First World War . There was a third , far more secret , mission for the Ocano Pacfico . It had become clear to a number of Hitler 's highest-ranking associates that the war might be lost - and probably would be - and that the life span of the Thousand-Year Reich was likely to be only a matter of years , perhaps less . With that in mind , it was deemed prudent to establish in South America a place of refuge . " Operation Phoenix " was set in motion . Money was ob-tained , largely from Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like - or from the living , by way of extortion . The equivalent of $100,000,000 ( in various currencies , including American dollars ) was aboard the Ocano Pacfico . Once smuggled ashore , along with the material for the interned Graf Spee crew , the money would be covertly placed in Argentine banks and used to establish a South American refuge for Nazis who not only hoped to escape punishment for their crimes , but who also sought a place where the Nazi philosophy could be kept alive for an eventual return to Germany . Himmler raised his eyes to Korvettenkapitn Boltitz . " Please be so good as to thank Herr von Ribbentrop for me , " he said . " Jawohl , Herr Reichsfhrer . " " That will be all , " Himmler said . " Thank you . " Korvettenkapitn Boltitz rendered another crisp Nazi salute , which Himmler again returned casually , then made a military about-face and marched out of Himmler 's office . Since the door to the outer office remained open , rather than returning to his desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Frau Hassler ! " Frau Hassler was tall , thin , and in her early fifties ; and she wore her gray-flecked hair in a bun . When she appeared at his door moments later , she was clutching her stenographer 's notebook and three pencils . " Please ask Oberfhrer von Deitzberg to see me immediately . " Oberfhrer was a rank peculiar to the SS that fell between colonel and brigadier general . " Jawohl , Herr Reichsfhrer , " Frau Hassler said , and pulled the door closed . Manfred von Deitzberg , Himmler 's adjutant , appeared in less than a minute . He was a tall , slim , blond , forty-two-year-old Westphalian ; his black SS uniform was finely tailored , and there was an air of elegance about him . He entered the room without knocking , closed the door after him , then leaned against it and looked quizzically at Himmler . He did not render the Nazi salute , formally or informally . " We 've heard from Goltz , " Himmler said , and held the message out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message , and read it . When he 'd finished , he looked at Himmler , returned the message to him , but said nothing . " Comments ? " Himmler asked . " It looks like good news , " von Deitzberg said . " But ? " " The Operation has not been completed . Either part of it . " " He seems confident that it will succeed . . . that both parts of it will succeed . You are n't ? " " There is an English expression , ' a bird in the hand . . . ' " " ' . . . is worth two in the bush , ' " Himmler finished for him . " I agree . Anything else ? " " I hesitate to criticize Goltz . I recommended him for this mission . " " But ? " " When next I see him , I will have a private word with him and suggest that it is never a good idea to put so many details in a message . " " I saw that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was obviously pleased with himself . " " And I think he wanted you and me to be pleased with him as well . " " Yes . Josef is not overburdened with modesty . " Von Deitzberg laughed dutifully . " I was a little curious about his fulsome praise for von Lutzenberger , " he said . " And von Lutzenberger 's people . " " Perhaps he really meant it . " " And he knew , of course , that von Lutzenberger would read the message . " " And that Grner is one of us , " Himmler said , smiling . " Do you think our Luther is becoming a politician , Manfred ? " " I think that 's a terrible thing to say about an SS officer , " von Deitzberg said . It was Himmler 's turn to laugh dutifully . " What are you going to do about it ? " von Deitzberg asked , nodding at the message . " Are you going to tell the Fhrer ? " " I thought I would solicit your wise counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to err on the side of caution , " von Deitzberg said . " I think I would wait until we have the bird in hand . " " If he has n't already , von Ribbentrop is about to tell Bormann , knowing full well he will rush to the Fhrer , that there has been word from Himmler 's man that Operation Phoenix will shortly be successful . " Party leader Martin Bormann was second only to Adolf Hitler in the hierarchy of the Nazi party and one of his closest advisers . " You do n't think he would wait until after we get the ' operation completed successfully ' message , so he could say , ' Our man ' ? " " I think von Ribbentrop would prefer to go to the Fhrer now , using ' Himmler 's man . ' Then , if something does go wrong , he could pretend to be shocked and saddened by that man 's failure . On the other hand , if it does go well , it will naturally be ' our man . ' " Himmler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I could , of course , get to the Fhrer first , either directly , or through Bormann - " " The Fhrer 's at Wolfsschanze , " von Deitzberg interrupted . Wolfsschanze was Hitler 's secret command post , near Rastenburg in East Prussia . " - then through Bormann , " Himmler went on . " And take a chance our friend - actually he 's your friend , is n't he , Manfred ? - is everything he - and you - say he is . Claim him as our man now , taking the chance that he wo n't fail . " " Were you really soliciting my wise counsel ? " von Deitzberg asked . " Of course . And your wise counsel is that we should wait until we see what actually happens , right ? " " Yes , Sir . " " On second thought , what I think I really should do now is call Bormann and tell him that we have just heard from Oberfhrer von Deitzberg 's man in Buenos Aires . That way , if Goltz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my SS , right ? And if he fails , it 's obviously your fault , von Deitzberg . You recommended him for that job . " Himmler smiled warmly at von Deitzberg . " May I suggest , with all possible respect , Herr Reichsfhrer-SS , " von Deitzberg said , " that is not a very funny joke . " " Joke ? What joke ? " He pressed the lever on his intercom , and when Frau Hassler 's voice came , told her to get Reichsleiter Bormann on the telephone immediately . One of the telephones on Himmler 's desk buzzed not more than ninety seconds later . Himmler picked it up and said " Heil Hitler " into it , then waited impatiently for whoever was on the line to respond . " Martin , " he said finally , and with oozing cordiality , " There has been good news from Buenos Aires . Our project there , under Standartenfhrer Goltz , of whom I am very proud , is proceeding splendidly . We expect momentarily to hear that the special cargo has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Graf Spee are on their way home . " There was a reply from Bormann that von Deitzberg could not hear , and then Himmler went on : " The SS exists solely to serve the Fhrer , Martin . You know that . " This was followed by another pause , and then Himmler barked " Heil Hitler ! " into the mouthpiece and hung up . He looked at von Deitzberg and smiled . " That put our friend Bormann on the spot , you understand , Manfred ? " " Yes , indeed , " von Deitzberg said . " He does n't want to go to the Fhrer with good words about the SS , " Himmler added unnecessarily , though with visible pride in his tactics . " But he wants even less for the Fhrer to get his information from other people , such as our friend von Ribbentrop . So he will relay the good news about Argentina to the Fhrer , saying he got it from me , and the Fhrer will not only like the information but be impressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very clever , " von Deitzberg said . " You have to be clever with these bastards , Manfred . They 're all waiting for a chance to stab us in the back . " " I agree . Is there anything else ? " Himmler shook his head , " no , " and von Deitzberg walked to the door . " Manfred ! " Himmler called as von Deitzberg put his hand on the knob . Von Deitzberg turned to look at him . " Are you , in your heart of hearts , a religious man , Manfred ? " " You know better than that , " von Deitzberg replied . " Pity , " Himmler said . " I was about to say that now that the die has been cast , Manfred , it might be a good time to start to pray that Goltz is successful . " " Are you worried ? " " I 'm not worried . But if I were you , I would be . You 're the one who selected Goltz for this . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected him . " " That 's not the way I remember it , Oberfhrer von Deitzberg , " Himmler said . " Thank you for coming to see me . " On 18 April , more than half of the 100 heavy German transport aircraft attempting to resupply the Afrika Korps in North Africa were shot down by American fighters . And across the world , in the South Pacific , over Bougainville , P-38 Lightning fighters shot down a transport carrying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , chief of the Japanese Navy , and Japan 's principal strategist . American cryptographers , in one of the most tightly guarded secrets of the war , had broken many high-level Japanese codes , and had intercepted messages giving Yamamoto 's travel plans and routes . The decision to attack his plane , which carried with it the grave risk of the Japanese learning the Americans had broken their codes , was made personally by President Franklin D. Roosevelt . On 19 April , the Argentine government of General Ramn Castillo was toppled by a junta of officers , led by General Arturo Rawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. II Corps , led by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley , began a major attack against the Germans in Tunisia .
