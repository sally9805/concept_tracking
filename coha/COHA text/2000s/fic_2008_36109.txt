Clayton and Thibault <p> Deputy Keith Clayton had n't heard them approach , and up close , he did n't like the looks of them any more than he had the first time he 'd seen them . The dog was part of it . He was n't fond of German shepherds , and this one , though he was standing quietly , reminded him of Panther , the police dog that rode with Deputy Kenny Moore and was quick to bite suspects in the crotch at the slightest command . Most of the time he regarded Moore as an idiot , but he was still just about the closest thing to a friend that Clayton had in the department , and he had to admit that Moore had a way of telling those crotch-biting stories that made Clayton double over in laughter . And Moore would definitely have appreciated the little skinny-dipping party Clayton had just broken up , when he 'd spied a couple of coeds sunning down by the creek in all their morning glory . He had n't been there for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the digital camera when he saw a third girl pop up from behind a hydrangea bush . After quickly ditching the camera in the bushes behind him , he 'd stepped out from behind the tree , and a moment later , he and the coed were face-to-face . <p> " Well , what have we got here ? " he drawled , trying to put her on the defensive . <p> He had n't liked the fact that he 'd been caught , nor was he pleased with his insipid opening line . Usually he was smoother than that . A lot smoother . Thankfully , the girl was too embarrassed to notice much of anything , and she almost tripped while trying to back up . She stammered something like an answer as she tried to cover herself with her hands . It was like watching someone play a game of Twister by herself . <p> He made no effort to avert his gaze . Instead he smiled , pretending not to notice her body , as if he bumped into naked women in the woods all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera . <p> " Now calm down . What 's going on ? " he asked . <p> He knew full well what was going on . It happened a few times every summer , but especially in August : Coeds from Chapel Hill or NC State , heading to the beach for a long , last-chance weekend at Emerald Isle before the fall term began , often made a detour onto an old logging road that twisted and bumped for a mile or so into the national forest before reaching the point where Swan Creek made a sharp turn toward the South River . There was a rock-pebble beach there that had come to be known for nude sunbathing-how that happened , he had no idea-and Clayton often made it a point to swing by on the off chance he might get lucky . Two weeks ago , he 'd seen six lovelies ; today , however , there were three , and the two who 'd been lying on their towels were already reaching for their shirts . Though one of them was a bit heavy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of figures that made frat boys go crazy . Deputies , too . <p> " We did n't know anyone was out here ! We thought it would be okay ! " <p> Her face held just enough innocence to make him think , Would n't Daddy be proud if he knew what his little girl was up to ? It amused him to imagine what she might say to that , but since he was in uniform , he knew he had to say something official . Besides , he knew he was pressing his luck ; if word got out that the sheriff 's office was actually patrolling the area , there 'd be no more coeds in the future , and that was something he did n't want to contemplate . <p> " Let 's go talk to your friends . " <p> He followed her back toward the beach , watching as she tried unsuccessfully to cover her backside , enjoying the little show . By the time they stepped from the trees into the clearing by the river , her friends had pulled on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly reached for a towel , knocking over a couple of cans of beer in the process . Clayton motioned to a nearby tree . <p> " Did n't y'all see the sign ? " <p> On cue , their eyes swung that way . People were sheep , waiting for the next order , he thought . The sign , small and partially hidden by the low-slung branches of an ancient live oak , had been posted by order of Judge Kendrick Clayton , who also happened to be his uncle . The idea for the signs had been Keith 's ; he knew that the public prohibition would only enhance the attraction of the place . <p> " We did n't see it ! " the brunette cried , swiveling back to him . " We did n't know ! We just heard about this place a couple of days ago ! " She continued to protest while struggling with the towel ; the others were too terrified to do much of anything except try to wiggle back into their bikini bottoms . " It 's the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out like a whine , making her sound like a spoiled sorority sister . Which all of them probably were . They had that look . <p> " Did you know that public nudity is a misdemeanor in this county ? " <p> He saw their young faces grow even more pale , knowing they were imagining this little transgression on their record . Fun to watch , but he reminded himself not to let it go too far . <p> " What 's your name ? " <p> " Amy . " The brunette swallowed . " Amy White . " <p> " Where are you from ? " <p> " Chapel Hill . But I 'm from Charlotte originally . " <p> " I see some alcohol there . Are y'all twenty-one ? " <p> For the first time , the others answered as well . " Yes , sir . " <p> " Okay , Amy . I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to take you at your word that you did n't see the sign and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to make a big deal out of this . I 'll pretend I was n't even here . As long as you promise not to tell my boss that I let you three off the hook . " <p> They were n't sure whether to believe him . <p> " Really ? " <p> " Really , " he said . " I was in college once , too . " He had n't been , but he knew it sounded good . " And you might want to put your clothes on . You never know-there might be people lurking around . " He flashed a smile . " Make sure you clean up all the cans , okay ? " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " I appreciate it . " He turned to leave . <p> " That 's it ? " <p> Turning around , he flashed his smile again . " That 's it . Y'all take care now . " <p> Clayton pushed through the underbrush , ducking beneath the occasional branch on the way back to his cruiser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amy had actually smiled at him , and as he 'd turned away , he 'd toyed with the idea of doubling back and asking her for her phone number . No , he decided , it was probably better to simply leave good enough alone . More than likely they 'd go back and tell their friends that even though they 'd been caught by the sheriff , nothing had happened to them . Word would get around that the deputies around here were cool . Still , as he wove through the woods , he hoped the pictures came out . They would make a nice addition to his little collection . <p> All in all , it had been an excellent day . He was about to go back for the camera when he heard whistling . He followed the sound toward the logging road and saw the stranger with a dog , walking slowly up the road , looking like some kind of hippie from the sixties . <p> The stranger was n't with the girls . Clayton was sure of it . The guy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; he had to be late twenties , at least . His long hair reminded Clayton of a rat 's nest , and on the stranger 's back , Clayton could see the outlines of a sleeping bag poking out from beneath a backpack . This was no day-tripper on the way to the beach ; this guy had the appearance of someone who 'd been hiking , maybe even camping out . No telling how long he 'd been here or what he 'd seen . <p> Like Clayton taking pictures ? <p> No way . It was n't possible . He 'd been hidden from the main road , the underbrush was thick , and he would have heard someone tramping through the woods . Right ? Still , it was an odd place to be hiking . They were in the middle of nowhere out here , and the last thing he wanted was a bunch of hippie losers ruining this spot for the coeds . <p> By then , the stranger had passed him . He was nearly to the cruiser and heading toward the Jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and cleared his throat . The stranger and the dog turned at the sound . <p> From a distance , Clayton continued to evaluate them . The stranger seemed unfazed by Clayton 's sudden appearance , as did the dog , and there was something in the stranger 's gaze that unsettled him . Like he 'd almost expected Clayton to show up . Same thing with the German shepherd . The dog 's expression was aloof and wary at the same time- intelligent , almost-which was the same way Panther often appeared before Moore set him loose . His stomach did a quick flip-flop . He had to force himself not to cover his privates . <p> For a long minute , they continued to stare at each other . Clayton had learned a long time ago that his uniform intimidated most people . Everyone , even innocent people , got nervous around the law , and he figured this guy was no exception . It was one of the reasons he loved being a deputy . <p> " You got a leash for your dog ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question . <p> " In my backpack . " <p> Clayton could hear no accent at all . " Johnny Carson English , " as his mother used to describe it . " Put it on . " <p> " Do n't worry . He wo n't move unless I tell him to . " <p> " Put it on anyway . " <p> The stranger lowered his backpack and fished around ; Clayton craned his neck , hoping for a glimpse of anything that could be construed as drugs or weapons . A moment later , the leash was attached to the dog 's collar and the stranger faced him with an expression that seemed to say , Now what ? <p> " What are you doing out here ? " Clayton asked . <p> " Hiking . " <p> " That 's quite a pack you 've got for a hike . " <p> The stranger said nothing . <p> " Or maybe you were sneaking around , trying to see the sights ? " <p> " Is that what people do when they 're here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implication . " I 'd like to see some identification . " <p> The stranger bent over his backpack again and fished out his passport . He held an open palm to the dog , making the dog stay , then took a step toward Clayton and handed it over . <p> " No driver 's license ? " <p> " I do n't have one . " <p> Clayton studied the name , his lips moving slightly . " Logan Thibault ? " <p> The stranger nodded . <p> " Where you from ? " <p> " Colorado . " <p> " Long trip . " <p> The stranger said nothing . <p> " You going anywhere in particular ? " <p> " I 'm on my way to Arden . " <p> " What 's in Arden ? " <p> " I could n't say . I have n't been there yet . " <p> Clayton frowned at the answer . Too slick . Too ... challenging ? Too something . Whatever . All at once , he knew he did n't like this guy . " Wait here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I check this out , do you ? " <p> " Help yourself . " <p> As Clayton headed back to the car , he glanced over his shoulder and saw Thibault reach into his backpack and pull out a small bowl before proceeding to empty a bottle of water into it . Like he did n't have a care in the world . <p> We 'll find out , wo n't we ? In the cruiser , Clayton radioed in the name and spelling before being interrupted by the dispatcher . <p> " It 's Thibault , like T-bow , not Thigh-bolt . It 's French . " <p> " Why should I care how it 's pronounced ? " <p> " I was just saying- " <p> " Whatever , Marge . Just check it out , will you ? " <p> " Does he look French ? " <p> " How the hell would I know what a Frenchman looks like ? " <p> " I 'm just curious . Do n't get so huffy about it . I 'm a little busy here . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most likely . Marge scarfed down at least a dozen Krispy Kremes a day . She must have weighed at least three hundred pounds . <p> Through the window , he could see the stranger squatting beside the dog and whispering to it as it lapped up the water . He shook his head . Talking to animals . Freak . Like the dog could understand anything other than the most basic of commands . His ex-wife used to do that , too . That woman treated dogs like people , which should have warned him to stay away from her in the first place . <p> " I ca n't find anything , " he heard Marge say . She sounded like she was chewing something . " No outstanding warrants that I can see . " <p> " You sure ? " <p> " Yeah , I 'm sure . I do know how to do my job . " <p> As though he 'd been listening in on the conversation , the stranger retrieved the bowl and slipped it back into his backpack , then slung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other unusual calls ? People loitering around , things like that ? " <p> " No . It 's been quiet this morning . And where are you , by the way ? Your dad 's been trying to find you . " <p> Clayton 's dad was the county sheriff . <p> " Tell him I 'll be back in a little while . " <p> " He seems mad . " <p> " Just tell him I 've been on patrol , okay ? " <p> So he 'll know I 've been working , he did n't bother to add . <p> " Will do . " <p> That 's better . <p> " I got ta go . " <p> He put the radio handset back in place and sat without moving , feeling the slightest trace of disappointment . It would have been fun to see how the guy handled lockup , what with that girly hair and all . The Landry brothers would have had a field day with him . They were regulars in lockup on Saturday nights : drunk and disorderly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Except when they were in lockup . Then they 'd pick on someone else . <p> He fiddled with the handle of his car door . And what was his dad mad about this time ? Dude got on his nerves . Do this . Do that . You serve those papers yet ? Why are you late ? Where 've you been ? Half the time he wanted to tell the old guy to mind his own damn business . Old guy still thought he ran things around here . <p> No matter . He supposed he 'd find out sooner or later . Now it was time to get the hippie loser out of here , before the girls came out . Place was supposed to be private , right ? Hippie freaks could ruin the place . <p> Clayton got out of the car , closing the door behind him . The dog cocked its head to the side as Clayton approached . He handed the passport back . " Sorry for the inconvenience , Mr. Thibault . " This time , he mangled the pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , you 've got some drugs or guns in your pack . " <p> " I do n't . " <p> " You care to let me see for myself ? " <p> " Not really . Fourth Amendment and all . " <p> " I see your sleeping bag there . You been camping ? " <p> " I was in Burke County last night . " <p> Clayton studied the guy , thinking about the answer . <p> " There are n't any campgrounds around here . " <p> The guy said nothing . <p> It was Clayton who looked away . " You might want to keep that dog on the leash . " <p> " I did n't think there was a leash law in this county . " <p> " There is n't . It 's for your dog 's safety . Lot of cars out by the main road . " <p> " I 'll keep that in mind . " <p> " Okay , then . " Clayton turned away before pausing once more . " If you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I just walked up . Why ? " <p> Something in the way he answered made Clayton wonder , and he hesitated before reminding himself again that there was no way the guy could know what he 'd been up to . " No reason . " <p> " Can I go ? " <p> " Yeah . Okay . " <p> Clayton watched the stranger and his dog start up the logging road before veering onto a small trail that led into the woods . Once he vanished , Clayton went back to his original vantage point to search for the camera . He poked his arm into the bushes , kicked at the pine straw , and retraced his steps a couple of times to make sure he was in the right place . Eventually , he dropped to his knees , panic beginning to settle in . The camera belonged to the sheriff 's department . He 'd only borrowed it for these special outings , and there 'd be a lot of questions from his dad if it turned out to be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . His dad was a stickler for protocol and responsibility . <p> By then , a few minutes had passed . In the distance , he heard the throaty roar of an engine fire up . He assumed the coeds were leaving ; only briefly did he consider what they might be thinking when they noticed his cruiser was still there . He had other issues on his mind . <p> The camera was gone . <p> Not lost . Gone . And the damn thing sure as hell did n't walk off on its own . No way the girls had found it , either . Which meant Thigh-bolt had been playing him all along . Thigh-bolt . Playing . Him . Unbelievable . He knew the guy had been acting too slick , too I Know What You Did Last Summer . <p> No way was he getting away with that . No grimy , hippie , dogtalking freak was ever going to show up Keith Clayton . Not in this life , anyway . <p> He pushed through branches heading back to the road , figuring he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look-see . And that was just for starters . More than that would follow ; that much was certain . Guy plays him ? That just was n't done . Not in this town , anyway . He did n't give a damn about the dog , either . Dog gets upset ? Bye , bye , doggie . Simple as that . German shepherds were weapons-there was n't a court in the land where that would n't stand up . <p> First things first , though . Find Thibault . Get the camera . Then figure out the next step . <p> It was only then , while approaching his cruiser , that he realized both his rear tires were flat . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
