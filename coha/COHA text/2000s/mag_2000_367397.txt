Cobb County , Ga. , May 11 , 2000 . It 's a Thursday morning , and 18-year-old " Karen " and five friends decide to go for it . They skip first period and sneak into the woods near their upscale high school . One of them takes out six rolls  --  six ecstasy pills  --  and they each swallow one . Then back to school , flying on a drug they once used only on weekends . Now they smile stupid gelatinous smiles at one another , even as high school passes them by . That night they will all go out and drop more ecstasy , rolling into the early hours of another school day . It 's rare that anyone would take ecstasy so often  --  it 's not physically addictive  --  but teenagers everywhere have begun experimenting with it . " The cliques are pretty big in my school , " Karen says , " and every clique does it . " <P> Grand Rapids , Mich. , May 1997 . Sue and Shane Stevens have sent the three kids away for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car so no one will bug them . Tonight they hope to talk about Shane 's cancer , a topic they have mostly avoided for years . It has eaten away at their marriage just as it corrodes his kidney . A friend has recommended that they take ecstasy , except he calls it MDMA and says therapists used it 20 years ago to get people to discuss difficult topics . And , in fact , after tonight , Sue and Shane will open up , and Sue will come to believe MDMA is prolonging her marriage  --  and perhaps Shane 's life . <P> So we know that ecstasy is versatile . Actually , that 's one of the first things we knew about it . Alexander Shulgin , 74 , the biochemist who in 1978 published the first scientific article about the drug 's effect on humans , noticed this panacea quality back then . The drug " could be all things to all people , " he recalled later , a cure for one student 's speech impediment and for one 's bad LSD trip , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martinis . <P> The ready availability of ecstasy , from Cobb County to Grand Rapids , is a newer phenomenon . Ecstasy  --  or " e "  --  enjoyed a brief spurt of mainstream use in the ' 80s , before the government outlawed it in 1985 . Until recently , it remained common only on the margins of society  --  in clubland , in gay America , in lower Manhattan . But in the past year or so , ecstasy has returned to the heartland . Established drug dealers and mobsters have taken over the trade , and they are meeting the astonishing demand in places like Flagstaff , Ariz. , where " Katrina , " a student at Northern Arizona University who first took it last summer , can now buy it easily ; or San Marcos , Texas , a town of 39,000 where authorities found 500 pills last month ; or Richmond , Va. , where a police investigation led to the arrest this year of a man thought to have sold tens of thousands of hits of e . On May 12 , authorities seized half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest e bust ever . Each pill costs pennies to make but sells for between $20 and $40 , so someone missed a big payday.
