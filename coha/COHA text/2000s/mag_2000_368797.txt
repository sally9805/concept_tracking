In late 1995 , scientist Joseph Bonuso unveiled Solomon , a powerful computer program that could try cases , infallibly , without the need for juries . It ran testimony through polygraph analysis ; it crunched legal algorithms on a team of supercomputers . Media from the San Francisco Chronicle to CNN covered Solomon , which had just done what a much criticized jury of humans had not . It had found O.J. Simpson guilty of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman . <P> The catch ? Solomon was a hoax , perpetrated by serial prankster Joey Skaggs . It 's not hard to see the story 's appeal . After a socially and racially divisive trial , many Americans  --  especially non-African Americans  --  believed that 12 Angelenos had rejected irrefutable DNA evidence to set a murderer free . Solomon played to a machine-age civic fantasy : a bloodless robot , immune to gambits and race cards , that would dispense justice like a candy machine . ( Nor is it only a conservative wish ; the anti-death penalty crowd has embraced DNA evidence to reopen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam-drill conflict in modern justice , the surprise hit of the new TV season is not such a surprise . CSI ( CBS , Fridays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) , a slick , formulaic crime drama set in Las Vegas , is a cop show with a twist : the heroes are crime-scene investigators ( CSIs ) , forensic scientists who use high-tech tools to nab crooks . The show has a certain Vegas-y rock-'n ' - roll sleaze appeal , but underneath it all , CSI is the geek Quincy , in which the true stars are the nail clippings , computer records , carpet fibers and above all DNA , performing like clockwork the same magic that they did n't on Simpson . <P> Where Dragnet satisfied a yearning for incorruptible cops , CSI evinces a longing for incorruptible machines , " Just the facts , ma'am " taken to its logical extreme . The CSIS ( led by William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger ) are bland , undistinguished types , as if to indicate how secondary the human factor is in this fantasy world of justice by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're guilty all the way ; the computer says so . There is no relativism , no my truth and your truth . It 's science . It 's nothing personal . And we never have to see the cases go through the messiness of a trial . <P> It is that human messiness that is captured in CBS 's excellent and disturbing Simpson mini-series American Tragedy ( CBS , Nov. 12 and 15 , 9 p.m . E.T. ) . Based on a book by Lawrence Schiller and former TIME correspondent James Willwerth , with a script by Norman Mailer  --  and contested in court by O.J. , who tried to prevent its airing  --  it delves into the nest of brilliance , ego and sheer weirdness that was the high-priced Simpson defense . For the dream team portrayed here , justice is no science but rather a mix of fact-finding , gamesmanship , theater and politics  --  including the jockeying among Johnnie Cochran ( Ving Rhames ) , canny , blustery and beset by late doubts about the client ; Robert Shapiro ( Ron Silver ) , shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , bloviating but deeply loyal to the Juice .
