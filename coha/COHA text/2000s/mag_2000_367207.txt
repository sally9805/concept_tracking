It 's no insult to Drew Carey to note that he ca n't exactly sing or act . Indeed , that 's his appeal . You got ta love the lunky guy , bluffing his way through this new musical version of Pinocchio and acting as if he owns the screen . Surround him with actual singers and actors and require him to emote , and our generosity is tested . But Carey is bolstered by a jovially hammy production , with music composed by Stephen Schwartz ( Pocahontas ) . It 's testimony to modern adults ' pop-psych self-absorption that Disney has recast the story around the puppetmaker dad 's parenting issues . At least they picked a charming guy to pull the strings . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
