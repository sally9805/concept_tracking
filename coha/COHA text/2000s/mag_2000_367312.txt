The race to sequence the human genome is almost over . Within a few weeks at most , the private company Celera Genomics will be announcing its successful completion of this monumental project , and the publicly funded Human Genome Project wo n't be far behind . <P> But the somewhat artificial nature of this much anticipated milestone was underscored in two separate announcements last week . Writing in the journal Nature , a team of scientists working on the public project reported that they had finished decoding chromosome 21 , the strand of DNA responsible for , among other things , Down syndrome . And a California company , DoubleTwist , Inc. , said it had used data from the public genome project to pinpoint 65,000 individual genes , out of the 100,000 or so in each human cell . <P> DoubleTwist 's achievement reminds us that sequencing the human genome is n't the same as understanding it . What Celera and the federal project have been doing is figuring out the order of the DNA 's chemical constituents  --  some 3 billion molecular " letters " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . <P> But an estimated 95% of those letters fall into the category of " junk DNA "  --  molecular gobbledygook that spells nothing at all . Discovering where the actual genes begin and end , therefore , is key to understanding their functions  --  and DoubleTwist has taken a step in that direction . Using a Sun Microsystems supercomputer , the company has taken raw data downloaded from the public project 's growing online database and put them through a computational wringer . <P> The result : a kind of road map to the genome , showing where along its long spirals of DNA the genes are located  --  65,000 of them with reasonable confidence , an additional 40,000 tagged more tentatively . For $10,000 a year , subscribers to DoubleTwist 's website can read portions of the map ; for $650,000 they can download the whole thing . And while the information is less detailed and thus less useful than what the gene sequencers will ultimately provide , DoubleTwist managed to get there first . <P> If DoubleTwist 's coup shows that the genome project could generate profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 illustrates the converse : completion of the project wo n't mean scientists understand genetic diseases . <P> In Down syndrome , for example , victims somehow acquire a third copy of the chromosome , whereas most people have just two . But exactly which of the 225 or so genes on chromosome 21 trigger the scores of physical and cognitive symptoms typical of the syndrome  --  or whether it 's simply DNA overload from having an extra chromosome  --  is n't clear , nor will it be without lots of additional research . <P> The same is true of the rest of the chromosomes . Sequencing all 23 will mean the crossing of a finish line of sorts . But it will be just the start of a long , difficult process to turn the information into practical treatments that can cure or prevent human suffering . <P>  --  By Michael D. Lemonick .
