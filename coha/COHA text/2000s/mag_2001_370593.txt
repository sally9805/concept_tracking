The set is a news desk , and the nice-looking man behind it seems ... um , troubled . About his life , perhaps ? About the news ? A touch of indigestion ? It 's hard to tell , but it becomes clear  --  and quickly  --  that he is funny . And smart . <P> Jon Stewart presides over Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , a blessed wedding of performer and format . Free of the burden of a full stand-up monologue , Stewart is able to put all his energy and wit into the news and guest spots . The word energy is almost too strong . Much of Stewart 's humor seems to spring from an underlying terrain of world-weariness . <P> You could say there has n't been such a soft-sell comic presence since Wally Cox , but the comparison would be too facile .

I ca n't remember when , I do n't recall , I think it was something over the ethanol tax  --  or wait  --  was it , oh , that 's right , the Civil War ? " <P> Repeat viewing of Stewart 's shows reveals good things you missed the first time  --  smallish matters of voice shading , inflections and gestures begun but not completed . If you 're a latecomer to his charms , you 'll wish your alleged friends had demanded that you start watching a lot sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . <P> Dick Cavett was the host of The Dick Cavett Show from 1968 to 1975 .
