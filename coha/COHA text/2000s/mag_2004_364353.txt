The airline business is so tough , the saying goes , that the only way to make a million bucks is to start with 10 times that . David Neeleman began JetBlue Airways in 2000 with an unprecedented $130 million . Launching a customer-oriented , low-fare airline on the cusp of what turned into the greatest crisis in U.S. aviation history was fortunate : this year JetBlue will become the first low-cost airline since deregulation in 1978 to so quickly become a major carrier , with more than $1 billion in revenues . <P> With a top-class product ( new airplanes , leather seats and live TVs on board ) , JetBlue challenged the skeptical perception of new airlines . But Neeleman , 43 , also changed the reality . His obsession with employee happiness and customer service ( when the blackout in August 2003 shut down most airlines , Neeleman drove out to the tarmac to beg for fuel ) has set JetBlue apart from the rest of the industry . His motto : " Bring humanity back to flying . " The legacy airlines , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat JetBlue , so they have started their own look-alike versions of it . But none of them have a Neeleman.  --  By Sally B. Donnelly
