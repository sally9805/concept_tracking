Venice , 1575 " I saw the way she measured you , Master . " Fear stripped away the carefully cultivated French accent that years of travel had perfected , revealing the Irish brogue . " You have made a bitter enemy . " Dr. John Dee touched the edge of the quill to the ink block , then deliberately etched a graceful looping curl to the end of the paragraph . " I am well used to women taking my measure , " he said absently . He dotted an i with a flourish , then dropped the pen to the table . Rubbing his hands briskly together , the spymaster broke off a piece of Venetian cheese from the wedge on the table before him . Its milky aroma filled his nostrils with delight , and he devoted his entire concentration to it as he savored the first bite . Then he sipped from the goblet of young Venetian wine . It was sour and tart , but once it was laid down for a couple of years , it would be very passable indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Ones , who had walked this world in the days following the Creation , dined only on cheese and wine . At that moment , he believed it was true . " Master , " Edward Kelly said evenly , " this be not some kitchen wench making eyes at you . This be one of the great Medici women . " " Be she the pretty one with the copper tresses ? " Dee asked , his voice muffled and full of the soft runny cheese . " No , Master , " Kelly sighed , " the ember-haired one was her maid . The hook-nosed one was Marie , niece of the Grand Duke of Venice . His favorite niece , " Edward Kelly added significantly . The English ambassador licked the last vestiges of his lunch from his ink-stained fingers and returned to his writing table to finish his writing , then tapped his teeth with the end of the quill . " Ugly girl with unfortunate eyes ? " " I did n't notice her eyes , " the big Irishman said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dago dagger . But I grant you , she was ugly , " he added with a toothy grin . " God 's blood , but was she ugly ! What did you say to her to put her so out of her humor ? " John Dee carefully penned his signature mark and then rolled his governmental report into a hollow wooden tube whistle and tossed it to Kelly . Within the week it would reach the court at London , where it would no doubt be read and discussed by no less a personage than the Queen herself . Unfortunately he had little to add to his earlier reports , or at least nothing he wished his monarch to know about . Dee might be doing his duty by Her Majesty , but that did not prevent him from turning a small profit for himself . Business should never get in the way of trade . Dee folded away his writing box and began to clean his quill ; then he suddenly smiled , his dark eyes dancing with amusement . Kelly caught the look and groaned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had barely escaped a French mob outside of Chenonceaux in the Val-de-Loire while attending one of Catherine the Florentine 's grand fetes champetres . " You remember now , " Kelly demanded of the small man . " She may have proffered an offer , " Dee said mildly , " that I was unwilling to accept . " He blew on the nib of the pen . The sound was a low lewd whistle . Edward Kelly immediately turned away and began to pack a few items into a leather satchel , mumbling that if they left now , they might be out of Venice before the vengeance of the Medici descended on them . " Did she , or did n't she , make you an offer ? " he demanded . Dee came to his feet , pressing his hands into the small of his back , arching his spine , and stretched toward a low-hung ceiling he could never expect to reach . Kelly 's orange-red hair brushed the filthy rafters , but even with the oversized heels of his boots , Dee barely stood five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it high and turned to examine his distorted reflection in the clumsy mirror . He was proud of what he saw there . At eight and forty a respectable , even a venerable age he still had a full head of hair . It was iron-gray now , of course , but he felt it lent his rather sharp features a measure of distinction , and emphasized his bright blue eyes . " Master ? " Kelly persisted . " What did that witch ask of you ? " " She made me an offer . " The small man shrugged . " She was intrigued by my size . She added that she had never been serviced by a man so small and mayhap it might make a merry divertissement . " " And your reply ? " " I pointed out that I had eyed many a midget at court and that it was unlikely that they were all eunuchs . " Kelly groaned aloud . " I protested her flouting my size . Though I am slight of stature , I am perfectly formed . Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yea , verily , " Kelly muttered . " I moreover cited that I was an alchemist and a mathematician , and as such , almost priestlike in my celibacy . " " And she believed you ? " Kelly asked in astonishment . " Nay , " Dee sighed . " She had heard rumor out of London . " " Which rumor ? " Dee was the subject of many of the most bizarre rumors that circulated in London society . Dee suspected that Kelly knew the good doctor was himself the source of many of the stories . Only last season , an extraordinary tale had gone the rounds of society that he was more than friendly with the Virgin Queen . " Tittle-tattle about me and the Queen , " Dee muttered . " Utter madness . " " Oh . That rumor , " the big man whispered , and crossed himself quickly . That rumor had almost had them killed , first by Elizabeth 's supporters , then later by those friendly to the dead Scottish queen . Lifting the bag off the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eased it open . Venice , washed bloodred in the late-evening twilight , spread about before them , slender towers silhouetted against the sky . The effect was marred by the pall of gritty smoke that blanketed the city and obscured the top floors of some of the taller residences , and the silence was disturbed by the shrieks of pigeons soaring in and out of St. Mark 's Square . Leaning out , he looked down . Ten feet below , filthy , foul-smelling , begrimed canal water lapped directly beneath their window . Dee joined him and peered down , wrinkling his nose , nauseated at the stench . " The rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril , " he muttered . " Can you swim ? " " Why ? " Kelly asked . " Because I can not . So you will have to jump in , swim to yonder boat , row it back here , then keep it steady while I descend . " Kelly shook his head quickly . " That 's a foolish waste of time . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next walkway . I could keep you afloat . " An enormous black rat crawled across a clotted mess of refuse and dropped into the oily water . " I would rather bed Marie de ' Medici , " Dr. John Dee said simply . " Now , mind your master and fetch that boat . I shall scribble de ' Medici a note of gramercy . " " As you wish , Master . " Handing the leather satchel to Dee , Kelly tugged off his worn boots and climbed onto the window frame , turned so that he was facing into the room , and lowered himself into the water . He sank beneath the surface , the coagulated water barely registering a ripple . When his head broke the surface it was streaked with filth , his red hair and beard plastered to his skull and matted with rotten fruit and bird droppings . Dee jerked his head back so that Kelly would not see the look of disgust and amusement on his face . He held him in too much esteem . He laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poncet of civet to take the stench of the water from his nostrils when the door cracked and splintered inward , and a score of guardsmen , wearing the distinctive blue livery of the Medici , burst into the room . Instantly , Dee caught the worried eye of his manservant , Kelly , and then swiftly turned to face his intruders . As the soldiers advanced into the chamber facing the blinding sunset , they could not see what was directly behind the man at the window . Dee deftly elbowed the out-of-sight satchel over the window 's ledge and out into the water . Although he was listening for a splash , he heard nothing and could only hope that Kelly had caught it . Folding his arms across his chest , he faced the soldiers with an arrogance that belied his height . Behind a barrier of lowered spears , he watched two of the guards professionally rip apart his room , scattering Dee 's personal items and heaving Kelly 's boots into a corner alongside the stinking chamber pot . There was a shout outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie de ' Medici strode into the room , light running silver and rose-red off the naked blade of the assassin dagger in her hands . Elbowing past the soldiers , she stopped before Dee . " Spy , " she spat in his face . Lifting the knife , the buxom wall-eyed woman placed it against Dee 's cheek . The point almost touched his left eye . He felt its heavy coldness , knew from its feather-light touch against his skin that it was razor sharp . When he had occasion to do bloody-handed work himself , he favored the Medici-style dagger , though he had never once considered that it would be used on him . The irony amused him and he was unable to prevent his lips from twitching in a smile . " You stand accused of spying for the Virgin Queen of England , of plotting against the Medici and Venice . What say you ? " Before he could respond , one of the soldiers brought over the wooden flute Kelly had left on the bed and handed it to the big woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee 's face and sheathed it , Marie de ' Medici snapped the instrument in half and pulled out the thin small sheet of parchment . She stared at it for a moment and frowned , bushy eyebrows meeting above her nose in a straight line as she scanned the lines of meaningless symbols inked onto the thin paper . Her unmasked anger was palpable . Majesty , your humble servant begs to bring you the latest news from Italy . The line was in Enochian script . " This is in code ! " " Is it ? " Dee asked mildly . " But this name here is clear enough , Dr. John Dee . What do you have to say , spy ? " she hissed . " What do you have to say to me now ? " " Alas , make assay , my lady Urinal . Someday you will meet a midget without a sense of smell . "
