Canto One Dante and Beatrice are at the threshold of Heaven . She explains to him that it is the nature of the human soul to rise . The glory of the One who moves all things penetrates the universe with light , more radiant in one part and elsewhere less : I have been in that heaven He makes most bright , 4 and seen things neither mind can hold nor tongue utter , when one descends from such great height , For as we near the One for whom we long , 7 our intellects so plunge into the deep , memory can not follow where we go . Nevertheless what small part I can kee of that holy kingdom treasured in my heart will now become the matter of my song . O good Apollo , for this last work of art , 13 make me as fit a vessel of your power as you demand when you bestow the crown Of the beloved laurel . Till this hour16 one peak of twin Parnassus has sufficed , but if I am to enter the lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast19 and breathe your song , as when you drew the vain Marsyas from the sheath of his own limbs . Father , virtue divine , should you but deign22 that I make manifest a shadow of the blessed kingdom sealed upon my brain , At the foot of that tree whosewood you love25 you 'll see me stand and crown my brows with green , made worthy by the subject , and by you . Poets and Caesars now so rarely glean28 those leaves to celebrate a victory ( man 's fault and shame , for our desires are mean ) , the Peneian branches must give birth to joy31 when any man should thirst for their high fame , in the glad heart of the Delphic deity . A little spark gives birth to a great flame.34 Better voices perhaps will follow mine , praying to hear what Cyrrha shall proclaim ! By various spills of light the sun will shine37 dawning upon the world of men that die , but at the three-cross intersection of Four rings it rises in the company40 of a more favorable time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With its most perfect seal . One hemisphere43 lay brightening in that stream and one grew dim , as it made morning there and evening here , When I saw Beatrice turn upon her left46 and look to Heaven to gaze into the sun : no eagle ever held a gaze so firm . As a reflecting ray will follow upon49 the first and in a glance , an instant , rise just like a pilgrim longing to turn home , So she instilled her gazing-through my eyes-52 into my powers of fancy , and I too stared at the sun more than our sight can bear . With our weak powers on earth one may not do55 what there one may-thanks to the special place created as the proper home for man . Not long could I sustain the brilliant rays58 before they seemed to flash like sparks that play round steel still white-hot from the forge 's blaze , And suddenly it seemed that day and day61 were fused , as if the One who wields the might adorned the heavens with a second sun . Into the everlasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her I gazed , far from that central sight . Her countenance had the same effect in me67 as did the plant that Glaucus tasted when it made him share the godhood of the sea . To signify man 's soaring beyond man70 words will not do : let my comparison suffice for them for whom the grace of God Reserves the experience . If I bore alone73 that part of me which you created last , O Love that steers the heavens , you surely know , For your light lifted me . And when the vast76 wheel you have made eternal by desire held me intent to hear the harmony You tune in all its parts , the sunlight-fire79 lit so much of the sky , no flooding stream or rain could ever fill so broad a lake . The newness of the sound , the swelling gleam82 lighted desire in me to learn their cause-keener than any appetite I 'd known . And she , who saw within me what I was , 85 to still the troubled waters of my soul , opened her lips before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making your mind dull88 with false imagining-you do n't perceive what you would see , if you could shake it off . You are not on the earth , as you believe.91 Lightning that flees its proper realm is not so swift as your returning to your own . " I admit I was shorn of my first doubt94 by the brief words she flashed me with a smile , but in another net my feet were caught : " My first amazement is at peace-but still97 I am amazed that I should rise so high , beyond the lightness of the air and fire . " She turned her eyes to me then with a sigh100 of pity , as a mother in distress whose child is ill and talks deliriously , So she made matters plain : " All things possess103 order amongst themselves : this order is the form that makes the world resemble God . Thence the high beings read the signs , the trace106 of that eternal Power who is the end for which the form is set in time and place . All natures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Source , some to approach more near and others less-Whence from their various ports all creatures move112 on the great sea of being , with each one ferried by instinct given from above . This is what makes the fire rise toward the moon ; 115 this , the prime mover of the mortal heart ; this makes the heavy earth condense in one ; Nor does this bow with target-cleaving art118 strike only things that lack intelligence , but beings made with intellect and love . The glorious world-ordaining providence121 forever stills the highest heaven with light , beyond the spinning of the swiftest sphere , And to that place as to our destined site124 we 're speeded by the power of that cord shooting each arrow in its happy flight . Often it 's true a form may not accord127 with the intent of him who works the art because the matter 's deaf and wo n't respond : So , from this course , a creature may depart130 if it should have the power , despite the push , to swerve away and veer off from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning flash133 from the high clouds , so cheating pleasures skew that first urge , and they plunge it to the earth . No more amazement should it bring to you136 that you ascend , than if a mountain stream should tumble rushing to the plains below . But it would be a cause of just surprise139 if , free of every bar , you should remain like a still flame on earth , and not arise . " Then to the heavens she turned her gaze again.142 From the Hardcover edition . Continues ...
