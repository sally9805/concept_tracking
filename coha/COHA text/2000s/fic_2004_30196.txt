1 . 1968 On a sticky August evening two weeks before her due date , Ashima Ganguli stands in the kitchen of a Central Square apartment , combining Rice Krispies and Planters peanuts and chopped red onion in a bowl . She adds salt , lemon juice , thin slices of green chili pepper , wishing there were mustard oil to pour into the mix . Ashima has been consuming this concoction throughout her pregnancy , a humble approximation of the snack sold for pennies on Calcutta sidewalks and on railway platforms throughout India , spilling from newspaper cones . Even now that there is barely space inside her , it is the one thing she craves . Tasting from a cupped palm , she frowns ; as usual , there 's something missing . She stares blankly at the pegboard behind the countertop where her cooking utensils hang , all slightly coated with grease . She wipes sweat from her face with the free end of her sari . Her swollen feet ache against speckled gray linoleum . Her pelvis aches from the baby 's weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimy **26;742;TOOLONG paper she 's been meaning to replace , and reaches for another onion , frowning again as she pulls at its crisp magenta skin . A curious warmth floods her abdomen , followed by a tightening so severe she doubles over , gasping without sound , dropping the onion with a thud on the floor . The sensation passes , only to be followed by a more enduring spasm of discomfort . In the bathroom she discovers , on her underpants , a solid streak of brownish blood . She calls out to her husband , Ashoke , a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering at MIT , who is studying inthe bedroom . He leans over a card table ; the edge of their bed , two twin mattresses pushed together under a red and purple batik spread , serves as his chair . When she calls out to Ashoke , she does n't say his name . Ashima never thinks of her husband 's name when she thinks of her husband , even though she knows perfectly well what it is . She has adopted his surname but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . It 's not the type of thing Bengali wives do . Like a kiss or caress in a Hindi movie , a husband 's name is something intimate and therefore unspoken , cleverly patched over . And so , instead of saying Ashoke 's name , she utters the interrogative that has come to replace it , which translates roughly as ' Are you listening to me ? ' At dawn a taxi is called to ferry them through deserted Cambridge streets , up Massachusetts Avenue and past Harvard Yard , to Mount Auburn Hospital . Ashima registers , answering questions about the frequency and duration of the contractions , as Ashoke fills out the forms . She is seated in a wheelchair and pushed through the shining , brightly lit corridors , whisked into an elevator more spacious than her kitchen . On the maternity floor she is assigned to a bed by a window , in a room at the end of the hall . She is asked to remove her Murshidabad silk sari in favor of a flowered cotton gown that , to her mild embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold up the sari but , exasperated by the six slippery yards , ends up stuffing the material into Ashima 's slate blue suitcase . Her obstetrician , Dr. Ashley , gauntly handsome in a Lord Mountbatten sort of way , with fine sand-colored hair swept back from his temples , arrives to examine her progress . The baby 's head is in the proper position , has already begun its descent . She is told that she is still in early labor , three centimeters dilated , beginning to efface . ' What does it mean , dilated ? ' she asks , and Dr. Ashley holds up two fingers side by side , then draws them apart , explaining the unimaginable thing her body must do in order for the baby to pass . The process will take some time , Dr. Ashley tells her ; given that this is her first pregnancy , labor can take twenty-four hours , sometimes more . She searches for Ashoke 's face , but he has stepped behind the curtain the doctor has drawn . ' I 'll be back , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse adds : ' Do n't you worry , Mr. Ganguli . She 's got a long ways to go . We can take over from here . ' Now she is alone , cut off by curtains from the three other women in the room . One woman 's name , she gathers from bits of conversation , is Beverly . Another is Lois . Carol lies to her left . ' Goddamnit , goddamn you , this is hell , ' she hears one of them say . And then a man 's voice : ' I love you , sweetheart . ' Words Ashima has neither heard nor expects to hear from her own husband ; this is not how they are . It is the first time in her life she has slept alone , surrounded by strangers ; all her life she has slept either in a room with her parents , or with Ashoke at her side . She wishes the curtains were open , so that she could talk to the American women . Perhaps one of them has given birth before , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Americans , in spite of their public declarations of affection , in spite of their miniskirts and bikinis , in spite of their hand-holding on the street and lying on top of each other on the Cambridge Common , prefer their privacy . She spreads her fingers over the taut , enormous drum her middle has become , wondering where the baby 's feet and hands are at this moment . The child is no longer restless ; for the past few days , apart from the occasional flutter , she has not felt it punch or kick or press against her ribs . She wonders if she is the only Indian person in the hospital , but a gentle twitch from the baby reminds her that she is , technically speaking , not alone . Ashima thinks it 's strange that her child will be born in a place most people enter either to suffer or to die . There is nothing to comfort her in the off-white tiles of the floor , the off-white panels of the ceiling , the white sheets tucked tightly into the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to their parents to give birth , away from husbands and in-laws and household cares , retreating brie.y to childhood when the baby arrives . Another contraction begins , more violent than the last . She cries out , pressing her head against the pillow . Her fingers grip the chilly rails of the bed . No one hears her , no nurse rushes to her side . She has been instructed to time the duration of the contractions and so she consults her watch , a bon voyage gift from her parents , slipped over her wrist the last time she saw them , amid airport confusion and tears . It was n't until she was on the plane , flying for the first time in her life on a BOAC VC-10 whose deafening ascent twenty-six mem of her family had watched from the balcony at Dum Dum Airport , as she was drifting over parts of India she 'd never set foot in , and then even farther , outside India itself , that she 'd noticed the watch among the cavalcade of matrimonial bracelets on both her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , in addition , she wears a plastic bracelet with a typed label identifying her as a patient of the hospital . She keeps the watch face turned to the inside of her wrist . On the back , surrounded by the words waterproof , antimagnetic , and shock-protected , her married initials , A.G. , are inscribed . American seconds tick on top of her pulse point . For half a minute , a band of pain wraps around her stomach , radiating toward her back and shooting down her legs . And then , again , relief . She calculates the Indian time on her hands . The tip of her thumb strikes each rung of the brown ladders etched onto the backs of her fingers , then stops at the middle of the third : it is nine and a half hours ahead in Calcutta , already evening , half past eight . In the kitchen of her parents ' flat on Amherst Street , at this very moment , a servant is pouring after-dinner tea into steaming glasses , arranging Marie biscuits on a tray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standing at the mirror of her dressing table , untangling waist-length hair , still more black than gray , with her fingers . Her father hunches over his slanted ink-stained table by the window , sketching , smoking , listening to the Voice of America . Her younger brother , Rana , studies for a physics exam on the bed . She pictures clearly the gray cement floor of her parents ' sitting room , feels its solid chill underfoot even on the hottest days . An enormous black-and-white photograph of her deceased paternal grandfather looms at one end against the pink plaster wall ; opposite , an alcove shielded by clouded panes of glass is stuffed with books and papers and her father 's watercolor tins . For an instant the weight of the baby vanishes , replaced by the scene that passes before her eyes , only to be replaced once more by a blue strip of the Charles River , thick green treetops , cars gliding up and down Memorial Drive . In Cambridge it is eleven in the morning , already lunchtime in the hospital 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jell-O , ice cream , and cold baked chicken is brought to her side . Patty , the friendly nurse with the diamond engagement ring and a fringe of reddish hair beneath her cap , tells Ashima to consume only the Jell-O and the apple juice . It 's just as well . Ashima would not have touched the chicken , even if permitted ; Americans eat their chicken in its skin , though Ashima has recently found a kind butcher on Prospect Street willing to pull it off for her . Patty comes to fluff the pillows , tidy the bed . Dr. Ashley pokes in his head from time to time . ' No need to worry , ' he chirps , putting a stethoscope to Ashima 's belly , patting her hand , admiring her various bracelets . ' Everything is looking perfectly normal . We are expecting a perfectly normal delivery , Mrs. Ganguli . ' But nothing feels normal to Ashima . For the past eighteen months , ever since she 's arrived in Cambridge , nothing has felt normal at all . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will survive . It 's the consequence : motherhood in a foreign land . For it was one thing to be pregnant , to suffer the queasy mornings in bed , the sleepless nights , the dull throbbing in her back , the countless visits to the bathroom . Throughout the experience , in spite of her growing discomfort , she 'd been astonished by her body 's ability to make life , exactly as her mother and grandmother and all her great-grandmothers had done . That it was happening so far from home , unmonitored and unobserved by those she loved , had made it more miraculous still . But she is terrified to raise a child in a country where she is related to no one , where she knows so little , where life seems so tentative and spare . ' How about a little walk ? It might do you good , ' Patty asks when she comes to clear the lunch tray . Ashima looks up from a tattered copy of Desh magazine that she 'd brought to read on her plane ride to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The printed pages of Bengali type , slightly rough to the touch , are a perpetual comfort to her . She 's read each of the short stories and poems and articles a dozen times . There is a pen-and-ink drawing on page eleven by her father , an illustrator for the magazine : a view of the North Calcutta skyline sketched from the roof of their flat one foggy January morning . She had stood behind her father as he 'd drawn it , watching as he crouched over his easel , a cigarette dangling from his lips , his shoulders wrapped in a black Kashmiri shawl . ' Yes , all right , ' Ashima says . Patty helps Ashima out of bed , tucks her feet one by one into slippers , drap nightgown around her shoulders . ' Just think , ' Patty says as Ashima struggles to stand . ' In a day or two you 'll be half the size . ' She takes Ashima 's arm as they step out of the room , into the hallway . After a few feet Ashima stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her body . She shakes her head , her eyes filling with tears . ' I can not . ' ' You can . Squeeze my hand . Squeeze as tight as you like . ' After a minute they continue on , toward the nurses ' station . ' Hoping for a boy or a girl ? ' Patty asks . ' As long as there are ten finger and ten toe , ' Ashima replies . For these anatomical details , these particular signs of life , are the ones she has the most difficulty picturing when she imagines the baby in her arms . Patty smiles , a little too widely , and suddenly Ashima realizes her error , knows she should have said ' fingers ' and ' toes . ' This error pains her almost as much as her last contraction . English had been her subject . In Calcutta , before she was married , she was working toward a college degree . She used to tutor neighborhood schoolchildren in their homes , on their verandas and beds , helping them to memorize Tennyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to understand the difference between Aristotelian and Shakespearean tragedy . But in Bengali , a finger can also mean fingers , a toe toes . It had been after tutoring one day that Ashima 's mother had met her at the door , told her to go straight to the bedroom and prepare herself ; a man was waiting to see her . He was the third in as many months . The first had been a widower with four children . The second , cartoonist who knew her father , had been hit by a bus in Esplanade and lost his left arm . To her great relief they had both rejected her . She was nineteen , in the middle of her studies , in no rush to be a bride . And so , obediently but without expectation , she had untangled and rebraided her hair , wiped away the kohl that had smudged below her eyes , patted some Cuticura powder from a velvet puff onto her skin . The sheer parrot green sari she pleated and tucked into her petticoat had been laid out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sitting room , Ashima had paused in the corridor . She could hear her mother saying , ' She is fond of cooking , and she can knit extremely well . Within a week she finished this cardigan I am wearing . ' Ashima smiled , amused by her mother 's salesmanship ; it had taken her the better part of a year to finish the cardigan , and still her mother had had to do the sleeves . Glancing at the floor where visitors customarily removed their slippers , she noticed , beside two sets of chappals , a pair of men 's shoes that were not like any she 'd ever seen on the streets and trams and buses of Calcutta , or even in the windows of Bata . They were brown shoes with black heels and off-white laces and stitching . There was a band of lentil-sized holes embossed on either side of each shoe , and at the tips was a pretty pattern pricked into the leather as if with a needle . Looking more closely , she saw the shoemaker 's name written on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded : something and sons , it said . She saw the size , eight and a half , and the initials U.S.A. And as her mother continued to sing her praises , Ashima , unable to resist a sudden and overwhelming urge , stepped into the shoes at her feet . Lingering sweat from the owner 's feet mingled with hers , causing her heart to race ; it was the closest thing she had ever experienced to the touch of a man . The leather was creased , heavy , and still warm . On the left shoe she had noticed that one of the crisscrossing laces had missed a hole , and this oversight set her at ease . She extracted her feet , entered the room . The man was sitting in a rattan chair , his parents perched on the edge of the twin bed where her brother slept at night . He was slightly plump , scholarly-looking but still youthful , with black thick-framed glasses and a sharp , prominent nose . A neatly trimmed mustache connected to a beard that covered only his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore brown socks and brown trousers and a green-and-white-striped shirt and was staring glumly at his knees . He did not look up when she appeared . Though she was aware of his gaze as she crossed the room , by the time she managed to steal another look at him he was once again indifferent , focused on his knees . He cleared his throat as if to speak but then said nothing . Instead it was his father who did the talking , saying that the man had gone to St. Xavier 's , and then B.E . College , graduating first-class-first from both institutions . Ashima took her seat and smoothed the pleats of her sari . She sensed the mother eyeing her with approval . Ashima was five feet four inches , tall for a Bengali woman , ninety-nine pounds . Her complexion was on the dark side of but she had been compared on more than one occasion to the actress Madhabi Mukherjee . Her nails were admirably long , her fingers , like her father 's , artistically slim . They inquired after her studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Daffodils . ' The man 's family lived in Alipore . The father was a labor officer for the customs department of a shipping company . ' My son has been living abroad for two years , ' the man 's father said , ' earning a Ph.D . in Boston , researching in the field of fiber optics . ' Ashima had never heard of Boston , or of fiber optics . She was asked whether she was willing to fly on a plane and then if she was capable of living in a city characterized by severe , snowy winters , alone . ' Wo n't he be there ? ' she 'd asked , pointing to the man whose shoes she 'd briefly occupied , but who had yet to say a word to her . It was only after the betrothal that she 'd learned his name . One week later the invitations were printed , and two weeks after that she was adorned and adjusted by countless aunts , countless cousins hovering around her . These were her last moments as Ashima Bhaduri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brow and cheeks dotted with sandalwood paste , her hair wound up , bound with flowers , held in place by a hundred wire pins that would take an hour to remove once the wedding was finally over . Her head was draped with scarlet netting . The air was damp , and in spite of the pins Ashima 's hair , thickest of all the cousins ' , would not lie flat . She wore all the necklaces and chokers and bracelets that were destined to live most of their lives in an extra-large safety deposit box in a bank vault in New England . At the designated hour she was seated on a piri that her father had decorated , hoisted five feet off the ground , carried out to meet the groom . She had hidden her face with a heart-shaped betel leaf , kept her head bent low until she had circled him seven times . Eight thousand miles away in Cambridge , she has come to know him . In the evenings she cooks for him , hoping to please , with the unrationed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had written about to her mother in her very first letter home . By now she has learned that her husband likes his food on the salty side , that his favorite thing about lamb curry is the potatoes , and that he likes to finish his dinner with a small final helping of rice and dal . At night , lying beside her in bed , he listens to her describe the events of her day : her walks along Massachusetts Avenue , the shops she visits , the Hare Krishnas who pester her with their leaflets , the pistachio ice cream cones she treats herself to in Harvard Square . In spite of his meager graduate student wages he sets aside money to send every few months to his father to help put an extension on his parents ' house . He is fastidious about his clothing ; their first argument had been over a sweater she 'd shrunk in the washing machine . As soon as he comes home from the university the first thing he does is hang up his shirt and trousers , donning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . On Sundays he spends an hour occupied with his tins of shoe polishes and his three pairs of shoes , two black and one brown brown ones are the ones he 'd been wearing when he 'd first come to see her . The sight of him cross-legged on newspapers spread on the floor , intently whisking a brush over the leather , always reminds her of her indiscretion in her parents ' corridor . It is a moment that shocks her still , and that she prefers , in spite of all she tells him at night about the life they now share , to keep to herself . On another floor of the hospital , in a waiting room , Ashoke hunches over a Boston Globe from a month ago , abandoned on a neighboring chair . He reads about the riots that took place during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and about Dr. Benjamin Spock , the baby doctor , being sentenced to two years in jail for threatening to counsel draft evaders . The Favre Leuba strapped to his wrist is running six minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is four-thirty in the morning . An hour before , Ashoke had been fast asleep , at home , Ashima 's side of the bed covered with exams he 'd been grading late at night , when the telephone rang . Ashima was fully dilated and being taken to the delivery room , the person on the other end had said . Upon arrival at the hospital he was told that she was pushing , that it could be any minute now . Any minute . And yet it seemed only the other day , one steel-colored winter 's morning when the windows of the house were being pelted with hail , that she had spit out her tea , accusing him of mistaking the salt for sugar . To prove himself right he had taken a sip of the sweet liquid from her cup , but she had insisted on its bitterness , and poured it down the sink . That was the first thing that had caused her to suspect , and then the doctor had confirmed it , and then he would wake to the sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her retching . Before he left for the university he would leave a cup of tea by the side of the bed , where she lay listless and silent . Often , returning in the evenings , he would find her still lying there , the tea untouched . He now desperately needs a cup of tea for himself , not having managed to make one before leaving the house . But the machine in the corridor dispenses only coffee , tepid at best , in paper cups . He takes off his thick-rimmed glasses , fitted by a Calcutta optometrist , polishes the lenses with the cotton handkerchief he always keeps in his pocket , A for Ashoke embroidered by his mother in light blue thread . His black hair , normally combed back neatly from his forehead , is disheveled , sections of it on end . He stands and begins pacing as the other expectant fathers do . So far , the door to the waiting room has opened twice , and a nurse has announced that one of them has a boy or a girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the father is escorted away . The men wait with cigars , flowers , address books , bottles of champagne . They smoke cigarettes , ashing onto the floor . Ashoke is indifferent to such indulgences . He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol of any kind . Ashima is the one who keeps all their addresses , in a small notebook she carries in her purse . It has never occurred to him to buy his wife flowers . He returns to the Globe , still pacing as he reads . A slight limp causes Ashoke 's right foot almost imperceptibly with each step . Since childhood he has had the habit and the ability to read while walking , holding a book in one hand on his way to school , from room to room in his parents ' three-story house in Alipore , and up and down the red clay stairs . Nothing roused him . Nothing distracted him . Nothing caused him to stumble . As a teenager he had gone through all of Dickens . He read newer authors as well , Graham Greene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College Street with pujo money . But most of all he loved the Russians . His paternal grandfather , a former professor of European literature at Calcutta University , had read from them aloud in English translations when Ashoke was a boy . Each day at tea time , as his brothers and sisters played kabadi and cricket outside , Ashoke would go to his grandfather 's room , and for an hour his grandfather would read supine on the bed , his ankles crossed and the book propped open on his chest , Ashoke curled at his side . For that hour Ashoke was deaf and blind to the world around him . He did not hear his brothers and sisters laughing on the rooftop , or see the tiny , dusty , cluttered room in which his grandfather read . ' Read all the Russians , and then reread them , ' his grandfather had said . ' They will never fail you . ' When Ashoke 's English was good enough , he began to read the books himself . It was while walking on some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gariahat Road , that he had read pages of The Brothers Karamazov , and Anna Karenina , and Fathers and Sons . Once , a younger cousin who had tried to imitate him had fallen down the red clay staircase in Ashoke 's house and broken an arm . Ashoke 's mother was always convinced that her eldest son would be hit by a bus or a tram , his nose deep into War and Peace . That he would be reading a book the moment he died . One day , in the earliest hours of October 20 , 1961 , this nearly happened . Ashoke was twenty-two , a student at B.E . College . He was traveling on the 83 Up HowrahRanchi Express to visit his grandparents for the holidays ; they had moved from Calcutta to Jamshedpur upon his grandfather 's retirement from the university . Ashoke had never spent the holidays away from his family . But his grandfather had recently gone blind , and he had requested Ashoke 's company specifically , to read him The Statesman in the morning , Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried two suitcases , the first one containing clothes and gifts , the second empty . For it would be on this visit , his grandfather had said , that the books in his glass-fronted case , collected over a lifetime and preserved under lock and key , would be given to Ashoke . The books had been promised to Ashoke throughout his childhood , and for as long as he could remember he had coveted them more than anything else in the world . He had already received a few in recent years , given to him on birthdays and other special occasions . But now that the day had come to inherit the rest , a day his grandfather could no longer read the books himself , Ashoke was saddened , and as he placed the empty suitcase under his seat , he was disconcerted by its weightlessness , regretful of the circumstances that would cause it , upon his return , to be full . He carried a single volume for the journey , a hardbound collection of short stories by Nikolai Gogol , which his grandfather had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the title page , beneath his grandfather 's signature , Ashoke had written his own . Because of Ashoke 's passion for this particular book , the spine had recently split , threatening to divide the pages into two sections . His favorite story in the book was the last , ' The Overcoat , ' and that was the one Ashoke had begun to reread as the train pulled out of Howrah Station late in the evening with a prolonged and deafening shriek , away from his parents and his six younger brothers and sisters , all of whom had come to see him off and had huddled until the last moment by the window , waving to him from the long dusky platform . He had read ' The Overcoat ' too many times to count , certain sentences and phrases embedded in his memory . Each time he was captivated by the absurd , tragic , yet oddly inspiring story of Akaky Akakyevich , the impoverished main character who spends his life meekly copying documents written by others and suffering the ridicule of absolutely everyone . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Ashoke 's father had been at the start of his career . Each time , reading the account of Akaky 's christening , and the series of queer names his mother had rejected , Ashoke laughed aloud . He shuddered at the description of the tailor Petrovich 's big toe , ' with its deformed nail as thick and hard as the shell of a tortoise . ' His mouth watered at the cold veal and cream pastries and champagne Akaky consumed the night his precious coat was stolen , in spite of the fact that Ashoke had never tasted these things himself . Ashoke was always devastated when Akaky was robbed in ' a square that looked to him like a dreadful desert , ' leaving him cold and vulnerable , and Akaky 's death , some pages later , never failed to bring tears to his eyes . In some ways the story made less sense each time he read it , the scenes he pictured so vividly , and absorbed so fully , growing more elusive and profound . Just as Akaky 's ghost haunted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ashoke 's soul , shedding light on all that was irrational , all that was inevitable about the world . Outside the view turned quickly black , the scattered lights of Howrah giving way to nothing at all . He had a second-class sleeper in the seventh bogie , behind the air-conditioned coach . Because of the season , the train was especially crowded , especially raucous , filled with families on holiday . Small children were wearing their best clothing , the girls with brightly colored ribbons in their hair . Though he had had his dinner before leaving for the station , a four-layer tiffin carrier packed by his mother sat at his feet , in the event that hunger should attack him in the night . He shared his compartment with three others . There was a middle-aged Bihari couple who , he gathered from overhearing their conversation , had just married off their eldest daughter , and a friendly , potbellied , middle-aged Bengali businessman wearing a suit and tie , by the name of Ghosh . Ghosh told Ashoke that he had recently returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voucher , but that he had come back home because his wife was inconsolably miserable abroad . Ghosh spoke reverently of England . The sparkling , empty streets , the polished black cars , the rows of gleaming white houses , he said , were like a dream . Trains departed and arrived according to schedule , Ghosh said . No one spat on the sidewalks . It was in a British hospital that his son had been born . ' Seen much of this world ? ' Ghosh asked Ashoke , untying his shoes and settling himself cross-legged on the berth . He pulled a packet of Dunhill cigarettes from his jacket pocket , offering them around the compartment before lighting one for himself . ' Once to Delhi , ' Ashoke replied . ' And lately once a year to Jamshedpur . ' Ghosh extended his arm out the window , flicking the glowing tip of his cigarette into the night . ' Not this world , ' he said , glancing disappointedly about the interior of the train . He tilted his head toward the window . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nameless villages they passed had been replaced by those countries . ' Have you considered going there ? ' ' My professors mention it from time to time . But I have a family , ' Ashoke said . Ghosh frowned . ' Already married ? ' ' No . A mother and father and six siblings . I am the eldest . ' ' And in a few years you will be married and living in your parents ' house , ' Ghosh speculated . ' I suppose . ' Ghosh shook his head . ' You are still young . Free , ' he said , spreading his hands apart for emphasis . ' Do yourself a favor . Before it 's too late , without thinking too much about it first and see as much of the world as you can . You will not regret it . One day it will be too late . ' ' My grandfather always says that 's what books are for , ' Ashoke said , using the opportunity to open the volume in his hands . ' To travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , ' Ghosh said . He tipped his head politely to one side , letting the last of the cigarette drop from his fingertips . He reached into a bag by his feet and took out his diary , turning to the twentieth of October . The page was blank and on it , with a fountain pen whose cap he ceremoniously unscrewed , he wrote his name and address . He ripped out the page and handed it to Ashoke . ' If you ever change your mind and need contacts , let me know . I live in Tollygunge , just behind the tram depot . ' ' Thank you , ' Ashoke said , folding up the information and putting it at the back of his book . ' How about a game of cards ? ' Ghosh suggested . He pulled out a well-worn deck from his suit pocket , with Big Ben 's image on the back . But Ashoke politely declined , for he knew no card games , and besides which , he preferred to read . One by one the passengers brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fastened the curtain around their compartments , and went to sleep . Ghosh offered to take the upper berth , climbing barefoot up the ladder , his suit carefully folded away , so that Ashoke had the window to himself . The Bihari couple shared some sweets from a box and drank water from the same cup without either of them putting their lips to the rim , then settled into their berths as well , switching off the lights and turning their heads wall . Only Ashoke continued to read , still seated , still dressed . A single small bulb glowed dimly over his head . From time to time he looked through the open window at the inky Bengal night , at the vague shapes of palm trees and the simplest of homes . Carefully he turned the soft yellow pages of his book , a few delicately tunneled by worms . The steam engine puffed reassuringly , powerfully . Deep in his chest he felt the rough jostle of the wheels . Sparks from the smokestack passed by his window . A fine layer of sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his arm , his neck ; his grandmother would insist that he scrub himself with a cake of Margo soap as soon as he arrived . Immersed in the sartorial plight of Akaky Akakyevich , lost in the wide , snow-white , windy avenues of St. Petersburg , unaware that one day he was to dwell in a snowy place himself , Ashoke was still reading at two-thirty in the morning , one of the few passengers on the train who was awake , when the locomotive engine and seven bogies derailed from the broad-gauge line . The sound was like a bomb exploding . The first four bogies capsized into a depression alongside the track . The fifth and sixth , containing the first-class and air-conditioned passengers , telescoped into each other , killing the passengers in their sleep . The seventh , where Ashoke was sitting , capsized as well , flung by the speed of the crash farther into the field . The accident occurred 209 kilometers from Calcutta , between the Ghatshila and Dhalbumgarh stations . The train guard 's portable phone would not work ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from site of the accident , to Ghatshila , that he was able to transmit the first message for help . Over an hour passed before the rescuers arrived , bearing lanterns and shovels and axes to pry bodies from the cars . Ashoke can still remember their shouts , asking if anyone was alive . He remembers trying to shout back , unsuccessfully , his mouth emitting nothing but the faintest rasp . He remembers the sound of people half-dead around him , moaning and tapping on the walls of the train , whispering hoarsely for help , words that only those who were also trapped and injured could possibly hear . Blood drenched his chest and the right arm of his shirt . He had been thrust partway out the window . He remembers being unable to see anything at all ; for the first hours he thought that perhaps , like his grandfather whom he was on his way to visit , he 'd gone blind . He remembers the acrid odor of flames , the buzzing of flies , children crying , the taste of dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a field . Milling about them were villagers , police inspectors , a few doctors . He remembers believing that he was dying , that perhaps he was already dead . He could not feel the lower half of his body , and so was unaware that the mangled limbs of Ghosh were draped over his legs . Eventually he saw the cold , unfriendly blue of earliest morning , the moon and a few stars still lingering in the sky . The pages of his book , which had been tossed from his hand , fluttered in two sections a few feet away from the train . The glare from a search lantern briefly caught the pages , momentarily distracting one of the rescuers . ' Nothi here , ' Ashoke heard someone say . ' Let 's keep going . ' But the lantern 's light lingered , just long enough for Ashoke to raise his hand , a gesture that he believed would consume the small fragment of life left in him . He was still clutching a single page of ' The Overcoat , ' crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the wad of paper dropped from his fingers . ' Wait ! ' he heard a voice cry out . ' The fellow by that book . I saw him move . ' He was pulled from the wreckage , placed on a stretcher , transported on another train to a hospital in Tatanagar . He had broken his pelvis , his right femur , and three of his ribs on the right side . For the next year of his life he lay flat on his back , ordered to keep as still as possible as the bones of his body healed . There was a risk that his right leg might be permanently paralyzed . He was transferred to Calcutta Medical College , where two screws were put into his hips . By December he had returned to his parents ' house in Alipore , carried through the courtyard and up the red clay stairs like a corpse , hoisted on the shoulders of his four brothers . Three times a day he was spoon-fed . He urinated and defecated into a tin pan . Doctors and visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid a visit . His family had saved the newspaper accounts . In a photograph , he observed the train smashed to shards , piled jaggedly against the sky , security guards sitting on the unclaimed belongings . He learned that fishplates and bolts had been found several feet from the main track , giving rise to the suspicion , never subsequently confirmed , of sabotage . Th had been mutilated beyond recognition . ' Holiday- Makers ' Tryst with Death , ' the Times of India had written . In the beginning , for most of the day , he had stared at his bedroom ceiling , at the three beige blades of the fan churning at its center , their edges grimy . He could hear the top edge of a calendar scraping against the wall behind him when the fan was on . If he moved his neck to the right he had a view of a window with a dusty bottle of Dettol on its ledge and , if the shutters were open , the concrete of the wall that surrounded the house , the pale brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade of sounds outside , footsteps , bicycle bells , the incessant squawking of crows and of the horns of cycle rickshaws in the lane so narrow that taxis could not fit . He heard the tube well at the corner being pumped into urns . Every evening at dusk he heard a conch shell being blown in the house next door to signal the hour for prayer . He could smell but not see the shimmering green sludge that collected in the open sewer . Life within the house continued . His father came and went from work , his brothers and sisters from school . His mother worked in the kitchen , checking in on him periodically , her lap stained with turmeric . Twice daily the maid twisted rags into buckets of water and wiped the floors . During the day he was groggy from painkillers . At night he dreamed either that he was still trapped inside the train or , worse , that the accident had never happened , that he was walking down a street , taking a bath , sitting cross-legged on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wake up , coated in sweat , tears streaming down his face , convinced that he would never live to do such things again . Eventually , in an attempt to avoid his nightmares , he began to read , late at night , which was when his motionless body felt most restless , his mind agile and clear . Yet he refused to read the Russians his grandfather had brought to his bedside , or any novels , for that matter . Those books , set in countries he had never seen , reminded him only of his confinement . Instead he read his engineering books , trying his best to keep up with his courses , solving equations by flashlight . In those silent hours , he thought often of Ghosh . ' Pack a pillow and a blanket , ' he heard Ghosh say . He remembered the address Ghosh had written on a page of his diary , somewhere behind the tram depot in Tollygunge . Now it was the home of a widow , a fatherless son . Each day , to bolster his spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he would stand unassisted , walk across the room . It was for this , each day , that his father and mother prayed . For this that his mother gave up meat on Wednesdays . But as the months passed , Ashoke began to envision another sort of future . He imagined not only walking , but walking away , as far as he could from the place in which he was born and in which he had nearly died . The following year , with the aid of a cane , he returned to college and graduated , and without telling his parents he applied to continue his engineering studies abroad . Only after he 'd been accepted with a full fellowship , a newly issued passport in hand , did he inform them of his plans . ' But we already nearly lost you once , ' his bewildered father had protested . His siblings had pleaded and wept . His mother , speechless , had refused food for three days . In spite of all that , he 'd gone . Seven years later , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurk around a corner as he rushes through the engineering department at MIT , checks his campus mail . They hover by his shoulder as he leans over a plate of rice at dinnertime or nestles against Ashima 's limbs at night . At every turning point in his lifeat his wedding when he stood behind Ashima , encircling her waist and peering over her shoulder as they poured puffed rice into a fire , or during his first hours in America , seeing a small gray city caked with snowhe has tried but failed to push these images away : the twisted , battered , capsized bogies of the train , his body twisted below it , the terrible crunching sound he had heard but not comprehended , his bones crushed as fine as flour . It is not the memory of pain that haunts him ; he has no memory of that . It is the memory of waiting before he was rescued , and the persistent fear , rising up in his throat , that he might not have been rescued at all . To this day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pent-up in cars unless the windows are open on both sides . On planes he requests the bulkhead seat . At times the wailing of children fills him with deepest dread . At times he still presses his ribs to make sure they are solid . He presses them now , in the hospital , shaking his head in relief , disbelief . Although it is Ashima who carries the child , he , too , feels heavy , with the thought of life , of his life and the life about to come from it . He was raised without running water , nearly killed at twenty-two . Again he tastes the dust on his tongue , sees the twisted train , the giant overturned iron wheels . None of this was supposed to happen . But no , he had survived it . He was born twice in India , and then a third time , in America . Three lives by thirty . For this he thanks his parents , and their parents , and the parents of their parents . He does not thank God ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one more dead soul he has to thank . He can not thank the book ; the book has perished , as he nearly did , in scattered pieces , in the earliest hours of an October day , in a field 209 kilometers from Calcutta . Instead of thanking God he thanks Gogol , the Russian writer who had saved his life , when Patty enters the waiting room . Mifflin Company .
