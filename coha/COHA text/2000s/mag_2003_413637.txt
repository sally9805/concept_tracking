Among the constants in this world  --  along with the sure knowledge that tide , wind and sea will always be on the nose during your run home  --  is the fact that powerboats fall into well-defined categories . An express is just that , and you ca n't mistake a runabout , trawler or racing machine . A motoryacht looks like , well , a motoryacht , and a hard-charging offshore fishing machine is a brute in any berth . It 's the way of the sea . So , when I wandered down a dock in West Palm Beach , Fla. , looking for the new Ocean 57 Odyssey , I knew just what to expect from this New Jersey-based builder of fine offshore angling machines . And there it was in all its flawless gel-coated glory  --  a bluewater battlewagon if I ever saw one . There was the classic , wave-slicing hull with a slight rise of the sheer going forward , a bit of flare to the bow and a fully enclosed flybridge raked somewhat aft . But where were the tower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I prepared to board from the stern , I realized the boat had a swim platform  --  a large one with three steps leading up to the starboard boarding gate . Now , that 's a serious no-no on a sportfisherman . How are you going to haul a grander up through that ? Also , the platform was bisected by a bulbous , hydraulically operated garage door , the kind that you see on motoryachts . And inside that garage was a 10-foot , jet-powered Nautica RIB with all the appurtenances needed to deploy and retrieve it painlessly . Then , it struck me . This Ocean is a ringer ; it 's a motoryacht lurking in the hull of a sportfisherman , which , when you come to think of it , is n't a bad idea . Fishing machines are designed to get where they 're going come what may . And while there are plenty of fast motoryachts , when the seas start getting up , most of them need to throttle down or else it 's rock ' n ' roll city . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff it full of liveaboard luxury and you have a **46;654;TOOLONG boat  --  which is exactly what Ocean intended with this Odyssey . Quick , in this instance , translated to 31.3 knots with the standard twin 800-hp Caterpillar 3406E diesels in 15- to 17-knot winds and quartering three- to four-foot seas in the Atlantic . Taking these seas abreast would make your basic fat and high motoryacht fervently wish for its berth . But the 57 's sportfishing hull ate it up . Then , for good measure , we cranked the throttle open and went head-to the seas at 25 knots . To say that there was no pounding or crashing would be an understatement  --  it was practically placid . The wind was onshore , so coming into the inlet we were accompanied by a following sea  --  a good way to challenge the tracking ability of any boat . There was no slewing off course or anything other than a steady , predictable response to the helm . One thing I found a bit disconcerting , however , was the flybridge . Basically , it 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive plate glass windows are not moveable ; there are no sliders that allow you to stick your head out . The atmosphere is strictly regulated by the climate-control system . On the other hand , there 's no possibility of window leaks . That bridge also goes pretty far toward serving as an additional hangout , as it 's equipped with two Pompanette chairs , a separate fridge and a color TV/DVD . Those windows also are darkly tinted , so while the skipper has excellent all-around visibility , if he docks from inside the bridge ( there 's no lower station offered ) communicating with the line handlers will be difficult . However , there is a small bridgedeck  --  reached through a solid , watertight door  --  complete with a hydraulic control-equipped steering station , which is just right for docking . Access to the flybridge is via a sturdy ladder/staircase from the aft cockpit , or via a delightful circular staircase from the salon . The salon is what you 'd expect in a high-end yacht . Airy and spacious ( the darkly tinted windows let in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dominated by a massive , L-shaped sofa and an entertainment center featuring a 27-inch , flat-screen TV . The U-shaped galley is forward on the same level , but partially separated from the salon by a cherry-paneled bulkhead . The cook can work efficiently and still be part of the social scene . Incorporated into the three steps leading down to the 57 's accommodations are touches that reflect the experience of this builder . For instance , wherever there 's a spare bit of space  --  including under the steps  --  stowage is built in , and necessaries like the washer/dryer are discretely hidden behind paneled doors . And handrails are strategically located , as they should be in a vessel destined for sea . The accommodations would do any yacht proud . This is a three-head boat  --  I know a few in its class that max out at two  --  and the amidships one , across from the smaller cabin with two single berths , serves as a day head . The master stateroom ( its fore-and-aft queen-size berth is aft and positioned just about dead center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the forward guest cabin , ( with its athwartships berth ) each have their own DVD-equipped TVs , heads with separate stall showers and plenty of stowage . Best of all , there 's no machinery  --  like compressors or pumps that hum in the middle of the night  --  stashed under the berths , as there are on so many motoryachts . The stroll-in engine room  --  entered from the aft deck  --  is an absolute delight . It 's well-lit and sports six-foot headroom . It 's roomy , too , which means it will be effortless for you to reach all around the iron ; there 's also easy access to the genset . There are diagrams for all the wiring and plumbing , which are color-coded , chafe-guarded and valved sufficiently . Ocean has put equal thought into the not-so-glamorous aspects of the 57 , such as cleats , which are plentiful and high enough to accept the larger-diameter line that a yacht of this size requires . A deck-accessed , self-draining anchor locker is serviced by a Lewmar Concept II windlass that 's a $3,450 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thought could 've gone into the deck nonskid , which , while molded-in , is a sand-like design that in my experience does n't serve very well in heavy weather . Also , the deck railing , which begins about amidships , is quite low for a good part of its run forward ; it 'll hit most of us at lower butt level . I like to see higher railing . And if you were to stride the sidedecks , there 's a short stretch after the step up from the cockpit where there 's not much to grab on your way forward . While the aft and side boarding gates are of hefty construction , the Perko twist latches that are supposed to secure them are , in my opinion , poorly designed . The gate has to be lined up with the adjacent coaming just right so that when the latch is twisted , the protruding stud meets the hole it 's supposed to go into . If the gate gets misaligned by 1/16 inch or so , they do n't line up  --  which was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the open aft gate at a boat show and knocked the thing off kilter so it became impossible to latch . Next time you 're down at your local inlet watching the sportfishermen roar out , keep your eyes peeled . One of them might be a ringer  --  it could be the Ocean 57 Odyssey heading out for a cruise . You 'll know it because a lot of those hot fishing machines will be eating its wake .
