Chapter One or , The Luckiest Girl It was a sweet September day on the beach , much like the day I 'd first sailed into Shoalwater Bay that April . The sun was skipping across the water , and the sky was a bright arc of blue racing to impossibly tall green trees . And for the first time since arriving on this wild stretch of wilderness , I felt lucky again . You see , I had survived these many months in the company of rough men and Chinook Indians , not to mention a flea-ridden hound , and while it was true that my wardrobe had suffered greatly , one might say that my person had thrived . I had made friends . I had started an oyster business . I had survived endless calamity : six months of seasickness on the voyage from Philadelphia , a near-drowning , a fall from a cliff , and a smallpox outbreak . What was there to stop me now ? Although a life on the rugged frontier of the Washington Territory was not recommended for a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suitable chaperone , I intended to try it . After all , I did make the best pies on Shoalwater Bay . And striding up the beach toward me was a man who appreciated them . " Jane ! " He had the bluest eyes I had ever seen , bluer than the water ofthe bay behind him . A schooner , The Hetty , was anchored not far out , and it was the reason I had packed all my belongings and was standing beside my trunk . The same schooner had brought Jehu Scudder back to the bay after a prolonged absence . Indeed , when Jehu left , I had doubted that I would ever see him again . " Jane , " Jehu said gruffly , his thick black hair brushing his shoulders , his eyes glowing in his tanned face . I had last seen him nearly two months ago , at which time I had hurt his feelings , and sailor that he was , he had vowed to sail as far away as China to be rid of me . " Jehu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red curls off my cheeks . He shook his head . " You 're looking well , Miss Peck . " " As are you , Mr. Scudder , " I replied , my voice light . We stood there for a moment just looking at each other , the soft bay air brushing between us like a ribbon . Without thinking , I took a step forward , toward him , until I was so close that I breathed the scent of the saltwater on his skin . And all at once I remembered that night , those stars , his cheek close to mine . " Boston Jane ! Boston Jane ! " a small voice behind me cried . Sootie , a Chinook girl who had become dear to me , came rushing down the beach , little legs pumping , her feet wet from the tide pool in which she had been playing . She was waving a particularly large clamshell at me , of the sort the Chinook children often fashioned into dolls . " Look what I found ! " she said , eyeing Jehu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thick black hair . " You remember Captain Scudder ? He was the first mate on the Lady Luck , the ship that brought me here from Philadelphia . " Sootie clutched the skirts of my blue calico dress and hid behind them shyly , peeking out at Jehu with her bright brown eyes . Her mother , my friend Suis , had died in the summer smallpox outbreak , and since then Sootie had spent a great deal of time in my company . Jehu crouched down next to her , admiring her find . " That 's a real nice shell you have there . " She grinned flirtatiously at him , exposing a gap where one of her new front teeth was coming in . Jehu grinned right back and squinted up at me from where he knelt . " I see you took my advice about wearing blue . Although I did like that Chinook skirt of yours , " he teased , his Boston accent dry as a burr . The cedar bark skirt in question , while very comfortable , had left my legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jehu , " I rebuked him gently . At this , his lips tightened and a shuttered look came across his face . The thick angry scar on his cheek twitched in a familiar way . He hunched his shoulders forward and stood up , deliberately looking somewhere over my shoulder . " Ah , yes , proper . " I bit my lip and stepped back . I had little doubt as to what was causing this sudden transformation . I had rejected his affections , as I had been engaged to another man . " So tell me , how is your new husband ? " he asked in a clipped voice . " Jehu , " I said quickly . He turned from me and stared angrily out at the smooth bay . " If you 'll excuse me , I 've got supplies to deliver , " he said tersely , and then he turned on his booted heel and strode quickly down the beach away from me . I took a step forward , Sootie 's arms tight around my legs . What was I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies Academy in Philadelphia , had a great number of opinions on the proper behavior of a young lady . I had discovered , however , that many of her careful instructions were sorely lacking when it came to surviving on the frontier . There was not much call for pouring tea or embroidering handkerchiefs in the wilds of Shoalwater Bay . And I certainly did nt recall any helpful hints on how to prevent the only man one had ever kissed from storming away for the second time in ones life . So I did something that I was sure would have shocked my old teacher . I shouted . " I did nt marry him ! " He froze and then turned back toward me , walking fast . He grabbed my shoulders and looked down into my eyes . " You did n't ? " Something indefinable flickered across his face . " It seems that Mr. Baldt already had a wife . " Jehu slapped his thigh triumphantly . " I knew he was no good ! "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
