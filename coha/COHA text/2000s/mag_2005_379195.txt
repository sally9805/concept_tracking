It 's 10 a.m. on a bright May day , and the arts wing at Gustav A. Fritsche Middle School in Milwaukee , Wis. , is hopping . In a band room , 21 members of the jazz ensemble are rehearsing Soul Bossa Nova with plenty of heart and impressive intonation , in preparation for a concert downtown . In another room , woodblocks , timpani and bells are whipping up a rhythmic frenzy as the 75-member Fritsche Philharmonic Orchestra tackles Elliott Del Borgo 's Aboriginal Rituals . In an art room , eighth-graders are shaping clay vessels to be baked in the school kiln . Down the hall , students are dabbing acrylic paints on canvas to create vivid still lifes la Vincent van Gogh . At 10:49 , when the 82-min. arts period ends , kids of all sizes , colors and sartorial stripes pour out of classrooms , jostling and joking , filling the hallway with the buzz of pubescent energy . Then it 's off to language arts , math , social studies and the array of other subjects offered at this sprawling arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humboldt Park Elementary School , which serves kindergarten through eighth grade , a charming scene unfolds in Karen Hennessy 's classroom . Her kindergartners are enjoying a visit from their eighth-grade " buddies . " All around the room , big kids sit knees to chest in miniature chairs or cross-legged on the alphabet carpet . Each little kid has chosen a picture book to share with a big buddy . Some lean on eighth-grade laps as they listen . Logan Wells , a strapping 14-year-old , reads The Little Engine That Could to Alec Matias and Jacob Hill . Jacob , 5 , seems mesmerized equally by the bright illustrations and by the eighth-grader turning the pages . He presses against Logan as if to absorb some big-kid magic . The older boy reads on with gentle forbearance . <P> If you were 13 years old , where would you rather be ? Big , frenetic Fritsche , with its thrilling range of arts classes , bands , Socratic seminars and TV studio , all aimed at 1,030 sixth- , seventh- and eighth-graders ? Or calm and cozy Humboldt Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories of all 585 students , ages 4 to 14 ? If you 're the parent of a 13-year-old , which would you choose for your child ? The two schools represent two sides of a debate that has ripped through Milwaukee and other U.S. cities . For the past decade , middle schools have been the educational setting for roughly two-thirds of students in Grades 6 through 8 . But increasingly , communities are questioning whether they really are the best choice for this volatile age group . <P> In Milwaukee , both Fritsche and Humboldt Park have fine reputations , but the district has decided to place most of its bets on the likes of Humboldt Park . Since 2001 , it has expanded the number of K-8 schools from 12 to 48 , with 14 more on the way . Meanwhile , the number of middle schools in Milwaukee has shrunk from 23 to 14 . " Once young adolescents get to the sixth grade , the achievement level begins to decline a bit and disruptive behavior increases , " says William Andrekopoulos , the superintendent of schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " including some big middle schools , he notes , " but we know that a small learning community is going to make a difference .
