Chapter One The dead always had a story to tell . Luckily for the departed , Parker Hennessy knew how to listen , and he welcomed with great pride the responsibility of his extraordinary gift . He sat quietly in the tapestried Queen Anne armchair , with an expensive black leather portfolio-a Christmas gift from his beloved Susan-open on his lap . He took extreme care in the appearance he conveyed for the benefit of his living clients . The somber , compassionate professional epitomized . The dark patterned tie , respectfully subdued , matched his severe yet elegant navy suit . His shirt , crisp and white . His shoes , rich mahogany wingtips , polished to a high sheen . Hair , expertly groomed , with a subtle sprinkling of gray applied to his temples . Nails , neatly trimmed . Parker Hennessy-the consummate professional . Always . Counselor . Confessor . Caring and trusted confidant . All portrayed with nothing less than absolute perfection . He made certain of that , too , and he never faltered , regardless of the role he assumed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tissue from one of the many boxes he kept within easy reach , then quickly dipped his gaze to reacquaint himself with her name . Madelyn . Her name was Madelyn Strom . Sometimes the names became a jumble inhis mind , like white plastic balls bouncing frantically inside a Plexiglas container pumped with air , waiting for the chance to escape and be noticed . B-9 . I-25 . So many names . So , so many . Some he 'd forgotten . Others remained forever etched in his memory . A few burned there , too and , if he allowed himself , he could still breathe in the acrid smoke scented with the stench of their burning flesh . " Given the circumstances of your husband 's passing , you 'll want a closed casket , " Parker suggested . He kept his voice soft , his tone evenly modulated to convey the appropriate level of respect . The living demanded consolation in their time of bereavement , and he never failed to deliver . Dead was dead in his business-at least insofar as his living clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died an unhappy man . Why else would a fifty-three-year-old man have been compelled to chug down an entire bottle of prescription tranquilizers with a fifth of vodka ? The widow looked at Parker and nodded , her pale hazel eyes rimmed in red and banked in misery . He tried to imagine her sorrow-and could n't . He tried to imagine her husband 's misery-and seethed . Madelyn Strom lowered her gaze suddenly . Not , he knew , because he revealed an inappropriate emotion . He never did . He had a rare , exquisite gift . He was too good now to make a novice 's mistake . Had guilt caused her to look away ? Perhaps , he mused , surreptitiously sliding the box of tissues over the gleaming surface of the low oval table closer toward the distraught woman . Perhaps she 'd been the one responsible for her husband taking his own life . A highly likely scenario , in his experience . Experience that extended Parker Hennessy 's boundaries , but gained from the lives of many . So , so many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the payoff for his supreme patience , and was n't disappointed . " Walter was unfaithful , " she said on a strained whisper . " And I never knew . " Madelyn 's confession hardly surprised him . The dead always had a story to tell . All he had to do was wait for the truth to be revealed to him . His living clients trusted him . Counselor . Confessor . Caring friend . They trusted him with their grief-and their dirty little secrets . An hour later , he finally showed the widow to the door . Her hand trembled as she shook his . " Are you sure there 's no one I can call to drive you home ? " he asked her . " No , thank you , Mr. Hennessy . I ... " she hesitated . Her grip tightened and her eyes teared up again . " I ... I 'll be fine . " He doubted it , but he did n't care , either . In the time he 'd spent with her , he 'd learned all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Walter . A gentle , soft-spoken man with a weakness for pumpkin pie , foreign films-and young , pretty brunettes with large breasts who charged him by the hour for their services . He settled his left hand over Madelyn 's in the gesture of comfort expected of him . After promising that Hennessy 's Mortuary would ensure that her husband 's final event would be one of dignity and respect , he waited for her to descend the steps leading from the veranda before silently closing the wide front door . The barest hint of a smile touched his lips in anticipation of the task ahead . He left the public area of the funeral home and took the stairs down to the lower level where his small staff readied the body of Francine Meeks , an eighty-nine-year-old former high school chemistry teacher whose career highlight was marked by flunking a certain NASA big shot out of her eleventh-grade chem class during the seventies . Parker stopped to inspect the makeup artist 's work . Satisfied the mourners attending the service tomorrow afternoon would be pleased , he offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into his office and closed the door . The public memorial of Walter Strom 's short , tragic life would be dignified and respectful , as promised . None of the mourners would ever learn from him or his staff that the tears that will be shed by the Strom widow during the upcoming service , to take place in three days , will be because her husband had been infected with HIV , courtesy of a prostitute he frequented . Oh , yes , the Strom interment would be one of beauty and grace , but much less meaningful than the private celebration only he was qualified to perform - that was his duty to perform . Walter Strom needed him . Required his guidance . His expertise . His skill in uniting him with his true mate , the perfect woman worthy enough to remain by his side for eternity . Parker 's blood hummed with excitement , but he tamped down the anticipation . There was work to be done before he allowed himself to begin the search for Walter 's special lady . He must service the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranging delivery of the very expensive casket selected by the widow , undoubtedly in an attempt to assuage her guilt for driving her husband into the arms of prostitutes throughout their marriage . There were calls to the florist , the printer , and the writing of the obituary . Afterward , he would give his full attention to answering his calling , his unique gift . Only then could he provide his very special services to his rightful and deserving client . Yes , he mused , the dead always did have a story to tell . As their keeper , he was duty bound to ensure they were given the happy ending they 'd been deprived of yet deserved . And Parker Hennessy never failed to deliver . Greer Lomax closed the heavy volume of municipal codes and blew out a frustrated stream of breath . After wasting her lunch break pouring over the lexicon , she had n't come up with a violation for anything more than garden-variety vandalism . Not a single act of legislation could she find that specifically declared tombstone-tipping illegal , giving her zilch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney . She rubbed at her temple with the tip of her index finger , which did nothing to alleviate the slow , steady throb , caused from lack of sleep . The ruckus created by the angry mob of blue-haired widows who 'd stormed the Magnolia County Sheriff 's Department office this morning , loudly demanding swift and brutal justice for the disgrace to their husbands ' graves , had only increased the pounding in her head . Two aspirin , and enough strong coffee to seriously threaten the lining of her stomach , had n't provided so much as a modicum of relief . Experience dictated she would n't be rid of the pain unless she crawled into bed for a few hours of uninterrupted sleep . Being the only officer currently on duty , however , that was one luxury that would have to wait . She had bigger problems than a headache to worry about , like a bunch of crazy old bats threatening to stake out the local cemeteries themselves and take matters into their own arthritic hands . Greer let out another sigh and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . She should 've done a better job humoring the old gals instead of taking the honest , direct approach by telling them the best she could do was to issue a few vandalism citations , provided the kids responsible were even caught . " Just another day in paradise , " she muttered , then snagged her blue and white Magnolia Mavericks mug from the ancient , heavy metal desk and took off down the corridor toward the break room for more coffee . Chances were the vandalism was nothing more than another prank by some of the frat boys from Seaside College . All she had to do was lean a little heavy on the right pigeon and she just might save herself a bored-out-of-her-skull stakeout of Shady Knolls Cemetery . She stopped suddenly and frowned . What the hell was the matter with her ? She should be grateful that high stress was no longer a daily supplement on the job . Instead , here she was bemoaning a quiet night of tepid coffee and patrolling the bone yards within the county 's jurisdiction . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with too much time on their hands , or keeping a bloodthirsty group of geriatric vigilante-wannabes in line , she should be thankful . After close to six years of being up to her ass in body bags , she 'd better conduct a reality check and welcome an innocuous investigation of a few tipped headstones and quit whining about the lack of excitement . You ca n't have it both ways , Lomax . Damn straight . She continued down the corridor and entered the break room , where Blythe Norton , one of the dayshift dispatchers and the wife of Kyle Norton , another of Magnolia County 's deputies , attempted to relax . A difficult-enough feat in the hard plastic chairs surrounding the laminated wood-grain table , but near impossible , Greer imagined , for a woman in her ninth month of pregnancy . Greer nodded a greeting to Blythe as the other woman sipped a fragrant tea from a delicate china cup . She 'd pulled another of the chairs in front of her and topped it with a plush , burgundy velvet pillow . Leaning back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . A grin tipped Blythe 's wide mouth . " I thought for sure I was going to have to call for backup , " she teased Greer as she balanced the tea cup on her well-rounded tummy . Greer managed a small smile that felt more like a smirk . " The day I ca n't handle a bunch of fired-up little old ladies is the day I hand in my badge . " For good this time , she silently added . A sharp pang of regret took her by surprise . She should 've known taking another job in law enforcement was a mistake , but she 'd been caught off guard and had suffered a moment of weakness . When Sheriff Travis Willows had come begging with a job offer in his hands , she should 've locked and bolted the door . He 'd promised her the deputy position would be a temporary one and , like a fool , she 'd fallen for the line he 'd fed her . She was supposed to help out only until he could find enough warm bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to higher-paying jobs elsewhere . If it 'd been anyone else but Travis , she would n't have hesitated to give him a roadmap straight to Hell to see if ice water was being served there on tap . But Travis had been a longtime friend of the family . Saying no to him would 've been like saying no to her dad-if Buddy Lomax had been alive . Against her better judgment , she 'd taken the job . Not a month in uniform , the political climate changed and severe budget cuts followed , hitting the department hard . Eighteen months later , she was still pulling four to six shifts per week , along with the occasional double when necessary . Temporary position , my ass . Blythe 's tired smile widened . " After that panty-raid episode during Hester Simpkin 's funeral two weeks ago , ca n't say I blame the old girls for being upset . " In the past few weeks Shady Knolls Cemetery had become the prime target of every high school and college prankster in the county . Two weeks ago a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frat boys had resulted in the decoration of several of the cemetery 's trees . No one had noticed the colorful scraps of satin and lace dangling from the highest branches of a weeping willow near the gravesite where Hester Simpkins was being laid to rest-until a stiff breeze had blown in from the Atlantic , sending a rainbow of panties raining down upon the mourners , most of whom were elderly . Greer rinsed her mug , then poured herself a refill . She managed an answering chuckle as she walked to the table and sat opposite Blythe . " They wo n't be happy this time unless the ' evil miscreants ' are hanged at the intersection of Main and Chestnut . " Evil , she silently scoffed . As if these people had any idea of the evil that really existed in the world . As if they even knew the meaning of the word . Her stomach grumbled and she frowned . She peered into the pink bakery box in the center of the table , hoping for a chocolate-covered anything . Chocolate with anything but jimmies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tea before taking another sip . " Look at the bright side , " she said , resting her hand protectively over her protruding tummy . " With the kids tipping headstones , the local bovine have been temporarily spared the humiliation . " Greer nodded in agreement as she plucked a Long John donut coated with maple icing from the box . " Better expect a call from the DA 's office , " she said before taking a bite . " I overheard Betty Riddle issuing orders to the troupes as they were leaving . " " Oh , that reminds me . " Blythe set her cup on the laminated table . " I have a message for you from Travis . He 's tied up in another meeting with the county 's budget committee and needs you to be on-site for an exhumation at two-thirty . " Greer nearly choked on her Long John . " Me ? " she blurted . " Why me ? " " Because you 're the only one available . Kyle 's testifying today on a DUI that went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's Orson ? " Greer demanded . Tate Orson might be fresh from the Academy , but she did n't give a rat 's ass who was on hand for an exhumation . Anyone but her . Blythe shook her head . " He 's off duty until the weekend . " Greer chucked the half-eaten donut in the garbage can , her appetite vanished . So much for lunch . " Call him in anyway . " " No can do . He 's vacationing at his granddad 's cabin up at the lake . No electricity , no phone and no reception on his cell . " " Vacation ? He 's been with the department less than six months , " she complained . She 'd been on the job she had n't even wanted a helluva lot longer , and had yet to take so much as a sick day . Something was wrong with this picture . Blythe let out a weary sigh . " Travis warned me you 'd probably pitch a bitch . " " Yeah , well , he was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't do autopsies . Not anymore . " Blythe 's auburn eyebrows drew together in confusion . " I thought you only had to be on-site while they open the grave and provide escort for the transport of the body to the coroner 's office ? " A deep chill settled in the pit of Greer 's belly . She was going to be sick . " You have to be present for more than just the opening , " she explained , barely managing to suppress a shudder . " Call Travis back and tell him to find someone else . " She stood , her chair scraping loudly against the gray- and blue-speckled asphalt tiles . She had to get out of here . Air . That 's what she needed . Fresh air , to hopefully rid her memory of the stench of decaying flesh . " Greer , wait- " The chair nearly fell over , but Greer caught it without taking her eyes off Blythe . " Better yet , " she said , " I 'll call him myself . " And tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject herself to an autopsy . If being on-site for an exhumation was the only requirement , she 'd find a way to get through it-somehow . It was the thought of what came after the dig that had her throat already starting to close up in cold , stark fear . " You know he ca n't leave the meeting , " Blythe reminded her . " He needs to squeeze as much as he can from the budget committee . " Damn you , Willows . If Travis managed to wrangle additional funding for the department , he could hire more deputies , which would , thankfully , number her days in uniform . Was n't that her goal ? To hang it all up-for good ? She wrapped her fingers around the back of the chair and squeezed until her knuckles ached . " Ca n't the dig be postponed ? " she asked , not caring that she sounded desperate . She was desperate . ( Continues ... )                   @ @
