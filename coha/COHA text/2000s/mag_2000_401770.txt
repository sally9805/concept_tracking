The editors of The Saturday Evening Post celebrate <p> Halloween , according to one modern dictionary , is " the evening of All Saints ' Day . October 31 , especially as celebrated by children dressing in costumes and collecting treats door-to-door , " <p> Halloween , however , is far from modern , and its celebration has changed over the years . <p> There was a time when treats were not involved . Kids performed their tricks for thc sheer fun of it . These were the All Saints ' Eves when children were Far from saints and homeowners were more than willing , to per tray themselves as goblins , <p> Rather than the tame pursuit of bobbing for apples , excitement in the good old days centered more on pushing over outhouses before the owner could come rushing out and scaring the pants off the young miscreants . Reflecting upon it now , such tricks seem crude , indeed . But as Samuel Johnson noted in a letter to Boswell . " Remember that all tricks arc either knavish or childish .

A bit less troublesome was the laying of a slab of wood over the chimney and smoking out the residents . <p> Post illustrators , however , as you will see , comprised a more refined group of trick-or-treaters who took the observation from Fontaine 's The Rooster and the Fox to heart : " It is doubly pleasing to trick thc trickster . " Thus we see pranksters being scared spitless as well as committing pranks , and a few simply enjoying this occasion to celebrate the saints . <p> May you find their efforts equally entertaining . <p> The eyes have it . And what they reflect surely is nothing less than James Whitcomb Riley 's warning about what the goblins will do if you do n't watch out . We can only hope that this particular goblin will remove its head before the kids are scared too stiff to run . Or perhaps that would n't help . From their appearance , it may already be a tad late . <p> In this somber scene by John Falter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shakedown march for treats at every door in the neighborhood . Quite a departure from the old days of swiping gates or rigging up a garden hose aimed at the front door so when the protester came dashing out , he got it flush in the beezer . <p> That 's enough for us , Mr. Zombie ! You can keep your wormy apples and your sourdough tarts . We are heading home for dear old Mom . We were n't all that hungry , anyway . Maybe next year . . . but do n't count on it ! <p> It is doubtful that Mr. Shakespeare 's " Out , out , brief candle ! " had anything to do with this . However , the candle was out as far back as November 3 , 1934 , to be replaced by a lightbulb in this Post cover illustration by Eugene Iverd .

" <p> Once again the fodder 's in the shock and the frost is on the jack-o-lantern , and the little Halloweenies will cut faces in the pumpkins while dear old Dad will cut his finger showing them how it can be done . <p> As a young witch , I 'll confess I was something of a cutup . But instead of growing out if it , here I am , still at it . I wonder if I could maybe move up to reconstructive surgery . <p> " The loathsome mask has fallen , " wrote Shelly in Queen Mab . But here the Post cover artist chose to reveal a face showing all the excitement and wonder of a night filled with those goblins that will get you . <p> We have to go to Keats ' lines in Ode to Psyche for this description : " With loaded bubbles winking at the brim/And purple-stained mouth . . . .
