Henriques , a New Jersey-based builder , makes a lot of the fact that its boats are used by the local professionals . These are the charter captains who earn a living getting banged around in the Atlantic Ocean all day while pursuing monster gamefish for paying customers . These guys do n't have an average commute . Not by a long shot . They travel from Montauk , N.Y. , and Cape May , N.J. , out to the offshore canyons , and often along rough stretches of salt water . They need reliable boats to keep their businesses afloat . Based on this information , you could say the Henriques brand comes with good references . The 42 Sportfisherman is the builder 's new model . Like most convertibles , it 's designed to be a combination platform for fishing or cruising . You can round up the guys to troll for a day , then get back to the dock to pick up the wife for the weekend . That 's the beauty of a convertible . A number of reputable builders offer convertibles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Albemarle . The Henriques is distinctive for its semicustom quality . The company builds only about 25 models each year , so it can work with owners on special requests . Just recently , Henriques re-worked the entire salon for an owner who wanted a big La-Z-Boy chair . " We believe the owner should have a significant say in how his boat is put together , " says Andy Eget of Integrity Marine , the exclusive dealer for the Henriques line . Eget ran the boat during our performance trials in the Atlantic Ocean off Margate , N.J. These are highly competitive waters for anglers . In fact , one of the country 's richest billfish tournaments gets played out nearby every summer : the Mid-Atlantic $500,000 . Anglers in these parts take their fishing seriously . That could be why the cockpit on the 42 is super-sized . Total square footage is 155 . The 42 has a modified-V hull with a sharp entry that cuts through seas . On a fishing boat , a smooth ride through the slop is only half the story ; comfort while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has flat sections aft that create stability when the boat is running at low rpm , or no rpm for drift fishing . Years ago , Henriques was criticized for Spartan interiors , but the builder has made bold strides in recent years . The cabin on this 42 is no exception , what with the home-style comforts and quality materials in the salon , galley , master stateroom , guest cabin and head . Hand-milled woods , Corian counters and a big-screen TV are present , but even with the creature comforts , Henriques never forgets the angler . In the master stateroom , for instance , there 's a 71/2-foot-long locker  --  it 's sized just right for fishing rods , not decorator pillows . In fact , if it 's set up properly , the 42 can stow as many as 50 rods . The pros would approve of that , but you do n't have to be a charter captain to see that the Henriques is one brawny , hardcharging fishing machine . This article contains a table .
