The Power Broker By Stephen Frey Random House Stephen Frey 1 Christian Gillette sat on the balcony of his suite at Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas , watching first light scale the craggy peaks in the distance . In a few hours tourists would be mobbing the casino on the ground floor . He hoped soon it would be his casino they 'd be mobbing . Christian ran Everest Capital , a Manhattan-based investment firm that owned thirty companies in a wide range of industries -- smokestack to high-tech . The companies were all large , at least a billion in sales , and Christian chaired eighteen of them . He also chaired Central States Telecom and Satellite , a communications company in Chicago that Everest had taken public six months ago -- after owning for three years . Everest had made four hundred million on the CST initial public offering -- Christian had gotten twenty of that . Forty years old , he 'd already made fifty times more than most people did in a lifetime , but it had n't gone to his head . Money was just money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell number . Nigel was one of Everest 's five managing partners . There were sixty-four people at the firm , but , other than his assistant , Debbie , the five partners were Christian 's only direct reports . Beneath the partners was a burgeoning pyramid of managing directors , vice presidents , and associates , but he rarely dealt with them . Fiveyears ago , he 'd known everyone at Everest by name . He missed those days . Nigel answered on the third ring . " Well , well , you gambling , Chris ? " Nigel had lived in the United States for almost twenty years , but his British accent remained heavy . " Sitting in front of some one-armed bandit with your bucket of quarters ? " He laughed . " Ah , the slot machine . Another wonderful contribution to mankind from you Americans . Right up there with rap music and the Big Mac . " Playing the slots actually sounded like fun to Christian , if only for its pure simplicity , but there was n't time . It seemed like there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't mind rap once in a while , and I do n't know why you , of all people , would bash the Big Mac . You 've eaten your share . " " Hey , chap , what I eat is my business . " " Relax , chap , I 'm just kidding . " Christian heard traffic in the background at the other end of the line -- horns blaring , engines revving , tires skidding . " Where are you ? " " Walking down Park . Bit of a late start to the office this morning , I 'm afraid . " Nigel was huffing as he strode toward Everest 's Park Avenue headquarters . The Brit was thirty pounds overweight thanks to a steady diet of rocky road ice cream and those Big Macs . " Up late last night ? " Christian asked . Nigel was fresh into a new relationship with a pretty brunette he 'd met a few weeks ago . They were in the infatuation stage , calling each other five times a day and staying out late every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how wonderful she is . " " Look , I --  " " No , no , I 'm glad you 're finally enjoying yourself , " Christian broke in . Nigel had put in a lot of long days the last few years , taking care of administrative details so Christian could focus on the big picture . Nigel had been Mr. Inside so Christian could be Mr. Outside , and the formula worked . Both Forbes and Fortune had tabbed Everest Capital as one of the top investment firms . " Now , any updates ? " Dead air . " Nigel ? " " Just one . " Christian picked up something in Nigel 's tone , and a tiny alarm went off in his head . " What ? " " After you left for Vegas last night , I got an e-mail from Bob Galloway . " Bob Galloway was the chief financial officer of CST . Despite being chairman of CST , Christian did n't know Galloway well , just saw him for a few hours at quarterly board meetings . Nigel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though Nigel was n't technically a CST officer like Christian , he was Everest 's day-to-day person on the investment . The one at Everest who constantly kept up with how CST was doing . The one who knew CST 's financial staff and had been in charge of dealing directly with the lawyers and investment bankers during the IPO . " Some woman from the Securities and Exchange Commission called Galloway yesterday , " Nigel explained . Hearing from the SEC was like hearing from the IRS or the Grim Reaper : Safe bet it was n't good news . " What did she want ? " Christian asked . " She called to demand a meeting . Did n't tell Galloway any more than that . " " Okay , call Galloway as soon as we 're finished . Tell him to get back in touch with the SEC right away and find out what 's going on . Let me know as soon as you hear anything . And , Nigel ? " " Yeah ? " " Make sure Galloway does n't mention this to anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian heard a trace of fear in Nigel 's tone . " It 'll be fine , pal . Do n't worry . " " Oh , I 'm worried all right , " Nigel admitted . " Being worried does n't help . " " Sorry I 'm human . I 'm glad you can stay so cool about it , Chris , but those people scare the hell out of me . They can destroy anybody anytime . Remember that guy who got twenty years for telling his girlfriend he had a stock tip over the phone , when what he really said was he had a sock that was ripped ? " " What guy ? I do n't remember that . " " And with my accent , " Nigel continued , " I could see it happening to me . " " It 's not like that . " " Oh yeah ? Ask the guys at Enron and MCI . " " They got what they deserved . " " You 'll be whistling a different tune when they bust into Everest and lead you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " Sometimes Nigel panicked too quickly . He did n't have many faults , but hitting the eject button prematurely was one of them . " That call Galloway got was probably nothing , probably just some kind of follow-up on the IPO . " " I hope so . Hey , what about the casino license ? " Nigel asked , his voice growing stronger as he switched subjects . " Everything all right there ? Opening day is n't far off . " Two years ago Everest Capital had won the National Football League 's new Las Vegas franchise and named it the Dice . They 'd spent over seven hundred million for the team and a new stadium they were building east of the city . As part of the deal with the NFL , Christian had gotten permission to build a casino , also naming it the Dice . The casino was supposed to open the day of the team 's home opener , which was just a few months away . On top of the seven hundred million for the team and the stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casino -- which was almost finished . Now , at the last minute , the Nevada Gaming Commission was holding off on approving the operating license . What seemed like a dream come true a month ago was turning into a nightmare . Christian had n't told anyone else at the firm how bad the situa- tion was . " We 'll get the license , " he assured Nigel . Trying to figure out what was going on with the license was Christian 's main reason for coming to Las Vegas . At two o'clock he was meeting with the chairman of the Gaming Commission . " Do n't sweat it . " Sometimes it seemed like he spent half his life convincing people there was n't any smoke and the other half putting out fires . " You think the mob 's involved ? " Nigel asked . " Think they 're holding the commission up for some last-minute dough ? " " I do n't know . That 's why I 'm here , to find out . " " Did n't we hire somebody in Vegas to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Like most people out there do when they 're building something big . What 's his name ? " " Carmine Torino . " Christian had been trying to reach Torino for a week , but suddenly no one could find him . Until now the guy had never taken more than fifteen minutes to return his call . Torino had vanished into thin air . " Yeah , right , Carmine Torino . " " I 've got ta go , Nigel . Ray Lancaster 's going to be here in a few minutes . " Ray Lancaster was the Dice 's head coach and general manager . Christian had hired him away from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last February . Nigel had gone to Florida to do the negotiating on the contract , so this was going to be Christian 's first face-to-face meeting with Lancaster . " Ray 's tough , " Nigel warned . " He better be . I want the Dice in the play-offs this season so we get all that extra publicity for the casino . Call me back when --  " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that ? Are we close to selling it ? " Christian let out a ten-ton sigh . " Let 's talk about it later . " Laurel Energy was a Canadian oil and gas company -- and another Everest problem child . Christian -- and everyone else at Everest -- had been anticipating a huge profit on the sale of Laurel , but it had been on the market for a while and there were n't any takers . Just a few nibbles from bottom feeders , and no one could figure out what was wrong because it was reserve-rich . " I 've got to go , " he said firmly . " Call me back when Galloway knows why the SEC 's snooping around CST so I can --  " " Where 's Allison ? " Another of Nigel 's annoying habits . Sometimes it was impossible to get him off the phone . " What ? " " Where 's Allison ? I 've been trying to get her for days . She 's been out of the office and has n't returned my calls . " Allison Wallace was another of Everest 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast working on that deal , you know , that company she 's been trying to buy for a month . Aero Systems . I talked to her last night . It 's going pretty well . She thinks the sellers are about to agree to terms . " Nigel snorted . " I guess the bitch does n't think I 'm important enough to call back . " " Hey , Nigel , none of that . She 's just --  " There was a loud rap on the suite door . " Talk to you later , Nigel . " Christian slipped the phone in his pocket as the person in the hallway knocked again , louder this time . " Who is it ? " " Ray Lancaster . " " Hi , Ray , " Christian said , extending his hand when he 'd opened the door . Lancaster had played defensive back for the Lions in the early eighties , but age and the stress of coaching had clearly caught up with him . His curly black hair was thinning and streaked with gray , his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his shirt . Like Nigel , Ray probably ate a lot of his frustration . " Christian Gillette . Thanks for coming so early . " " No problem , been looking at tapes since five this morning . First game 's closing in . Cleveland Browns . We 're gon na kick some ass . At least on defense . " " Good . I want to make the play-offs this season . " Lancaster stopped short . " Well , I do n't know if we're --  " " Let 's go out on the balcony , " Christian suggested , motioning toward the back of the suite . " I like it . " Christian pointed at the Dice logo on Lancaster 's aqua golf shirt as they sat down . Two tumbling die -- one showing a single dot , the other six -- with a sharp orange flame trailing behind them . " Yeah , it 's way cool . " " How 's your family doing ? " Lancaster and his second wife had two boys -- one thirteen , one eleven . Whenever Christian relocated an executive he always worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family was n't happy , neither was the executive . " Las Vegas is a big change from Tampa . " " They 're fine . Thanks for asking . " Lancaster seemed anxious , like something was on his mind . " Everything all right , Ray ? " " I should have called you after we inked my contract , but , well , better late than never . " Lancaster looked directly into Christian 's eyes . " Thanks for giving me this chance . I owe you . " Lancaster had n't been the Buccaneers general manager in Tampa , just head coach , so this was a big promotion . " Win me a Super Bowl and we 'll call it even . " Lancaster laughed nervously . " Yeah , right . " He tugged at the front of his shirt like it had suddenly gotten tight . " I did n't think I 'd ever get a shot to be a GM in this league , " he continued , skirting Christian 's Super Bowl demand . " Hardly any black men get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GM . " " You 've won a lot of football games . You got the Bucs to the NFC championship last year without a lot of talent . You deserve this . " " And I really did n't think I 'd get a shot from a white man , " Lancaster went on . " I thought I might eventually get it from a black owner , but not a guy like you .
