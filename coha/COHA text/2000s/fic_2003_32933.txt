Chapter One The road to my sister 's house snaked through the hills above Oakland , revealing at each curve a brief view of the bay in the glitter of the summer morning . Along the road , houses stood on small woodsy lots . The houses were rather woodsy themselves , of the post and beam school , more like natural outcroppings than structures . Wild roses dimpled the hillsides , small , blowsy flowers stirring faintly in the trail wind of my car . Otherwise , there was no movement . The sky was cloudless , the weather calm and the road ahead of me clear . Earlier , coming off the Bay bridge I 'd taken a wrong turn and found myself in a neighborhood of small pastel houses . Grafitti-gashed walls and a preternatural calm marked it as gang turf . The papers had been full of gang killings that month . When I drove past , a child walking by herself flinched , ready to take cover . None of that was visible from these heights . This was like living in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind : Eden , paradise , a line from " Sunday Morning " that I murmured aloud : " Is there no change in paradise ? " I could n't remember the rest . Elena would know . And she would appreciate the irony . She and I had grown up in a neighborhood called Paradise Slough in a town called Los Robles about an hour 's drive from here . There had been little about our childhood that could be described as paradisiacal . Our alcoholic father was either brutal or sullenly withdrawn . Our mother retaliated with religious fanaticism . As she knelt before plaster images of saints , in the flicker of votive candles , her furious mutter was more like invective than prayer . Their manias kept my parents quite busy , and Elena and I were more or less left to raise ourselves . This should have made us allies , but it had the opposite effect . We lived in adjoining bedrooms and occasionally as I lay awake listening to one of my father 's drunken rampages , and the wail of my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also awake , also listening . It never occurred to me to seek shelter with her , though she was five years older and so , by my lights , almost an adult . What she made of all this , I had no idea , as we never discussed what went on in our house . Elena and I were united only in our unspoken determination to show nothing of what we felt about this embarrassment of a life that our parents had visited upon us . In this we succeeded . To the outside world we were simply quiet children , good at school , not very social , a little high-strung . Consequently her friends and teachers were completely unprepared for her decision to enter a teaching order of nuns after she graduated from high school . I , on the other hand , understood perfectly . She did n't have a vocation . Our mother had ruined us both for religion . What had happened was that our father forced her to refuse admission to Berkeley on the grounds that she had had enough education for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could defy him . After he died , Elena left her order , got her master 's in American literature and took a job at St. Winifred 's College , a girls ' school where she had now taught for nearly twenty years . She never again referred to the four years she lived as Sister Magdalan , her bride-of-Christ moniker , and since it had all been faintly embarrassing to me- " my sister , the Sister , " I called her , never to her face-I did n't raise the subject . As long as my mother was alive , we maintained the fiction of being a family and I would see Elena once or twice a year . And then , ten years ago , Mother died , and we returned to Los Robles for the funeral . I was startled by how old Elena appeared ; the five years she had on me looked more like twenty . If her appearance was due to grief over our mother 's passing , it seemed excessive . My mother died of stomach cancer , and her last days on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elena seemed insensible with pain . On the way back from the cemetery , trying to do my brotherly duty , I took her hand and muttered consoling platitudes . She pulled her hand away , lit a cigarette and told me not to be a fool . We closed up the house and I went back to finish law school . A few months later I called her on her birthday . The phone was answered by a woman who identified herself as Elena 's roommate . When I asked Elena about her , she was evasive and then peremptory , but it was clear that her mood had lightened considerably since the funeral . In later phone calls , the roommate went unmentioned but every now and then Elena would slip pronouns from " I " to " we , " and at some point it occurred to me that this woman was her lover . I would n't have assumed this so quickly had I not been in the process of finally accepting my own homosexuality . By turns terrified and euphoric at the discovery that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth shut about it . I thought it would be wonderful if Elena was also gay , a final joke on our parents . When I told her about myself there was an appalled silence at her end of the line and then a sputtered , vehement lecture , complete with biblical citations , on the evils of homosexuality . Furious , I accused her of hypocrisy , spelling out exactly what I meant . She hung up on me . I did not talk to her again for a year and a half , until we ran into each other in San Francisco . After that we had fashioned a kind of truce , careful to call each other just often enough so that nothing too dire could be read into periods between . For many years we 'd lived within thirty miles of each other , she in Oakland and I on the peninsula . Our calls would terminate in a vapor of promises to meet for lunch or dinner , but we never did . Since moving to Los Angeles a year earlier , I 'd not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a note on my birthday . And then there 'd been her urgent call two days earlier , the very day that I was leaving for San Francisco to attend a wedding . I slowed down , searching for an address by which to orient myself . An old-fashioned mailbox on the side of the road bore the name of her street , and its number indicated I was approaching her house . An even clearer sign was the tumble of sensation in my stomach . Although I was acutely attuned to the emotions of those around me , this was merely a skill I 'd developed as a defense against being lied to by my clients : very few people evoked my own feelings . Elena was one of them . Toward her I felt-what ? - regret ? No , nothing quite as settled as that . The truth was , I did n't know what I felt but it was strong enough to bring me here on a mysterious summons against every inclination . I had never been to her house . I drove across a little wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine , and came to a stop in front of a brick and redwood split-level perched on the side of a hill . As I got out of the car , it occurred to me just how much time had passed since that summer afternoon in San Francisco when I 'd last seen her . She would be 42 now , and I , whom she 'd last seen as a stripling of 28 , a freshly minted lawyer , was now 37 and had been in some bad neighborhoods since then , and it showed . I pushed the doorbell . Melodious chimes sounded from within the house . I found myself face to face with my sister . We looked at each other and for a moment it seemed as if we might embrace , but the moment passed . " Hello , Henry . Come in . " " Hello , Elena . " I stepped into the cool hall . On a small wooden table was an earthenware pot filled with daisies , and above it a mirror in which I saw the back of her tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind me and said , " You look well , Henry . " " You , too . " She smiled briskly . " I do n't change , I just get older . " We started down the hall . I said , " It has been a while . We look more alike than ever . " She nodded . " Yes , I noticed that , too . " As children there 'd been a sort of generic resemblance between us ; we shared our father 's dark coloring , his black hair , teary brown eyes , and we each had the same high rounded cheekbones that had led to our grade school nickname , " los chinitos . " We no longer looked Chinese . There was a truer , more exact resemblance in the way our faces had thinned out with age , revealing the basic structure . " I can offer you coffee , or would you like a drink ? " Elena asked , leading me into a sparsely furnished room that looked out upon a patio and , beyond that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . " I had n't told her I no longer drank , because I was unwilling to make the admission of weakness that that would imply to her . While she made coffee in the kitchen I walked to the window . A regatta of sailboats drifted across the water like a cloud . Looking around the room , I observed the clean , hard Nordic surfaces of Elena 's surroundings . Even here , in her own home , she worked hard at revealing nothing about herself beyond conventional good taste , but there were dues about her past . A crucifix . A wave-shaped chunk of glass that , on closer inspection , was a stylized Madonna . An oil painting of a nude above the fireplace showed a desiccated woman with a flat Indian face , standing with her hands at her breasts , as if to protect herself . There was nothing soft about her nudity ; its graphic , painful clarity denied any sensuality-she was a Madonna for whom giving birth had been an act of self-obliteration . I wondered if this represented our mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I turned to find Elena setting cups and saucers , sugar bowl , creamer and spoons on the coffee table . " Joanne 's work ? " I asked , indicating the painting . One of the few things I knew about Elena 's roommate was that she taught art at St. Winifred 's . " Yes , that 's right . " Her tone warned me off that conversational trail . " You take your coffee black ? " " That 's fine . " I lowered myself into a chrome and leather contraption and watched her measure out a teaspoon of cream into her own cup , like Prufrock , measuring out his life with coffee spoons . I was reminded of the poem I thought of driving up . " It 's so beautiful up here , " I said , " I was thinking of that Stevens poem , ' Sunday Morning . ' What 's the line after , ' Is there no change in paradise ? ' " " You 're misquoting , Henry . " She got up and walked to the bookshelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volume that she flipped through knowingly . In a clear , low voice she read , " ' Is there no change of death in paradise ? Does ripe fruit never fall ? Or do the boughs hang always heavy in that perfect sky ... " Shutting the book , she looked up at me . " He makes it sound so dull . " " Do n't you think it would be ? Everyone sitting around gazing at God for eternity like reporters at a presidential press conference . Even Dante could n't work up much enthusiasm for paradise . " " You 're as cynical as my students , Henry . But they at least have the excuse of being young . " The coffee smelled of hazelnut . I sipped it . " Nice , " I said . " You 've become quite elegant , Elena . " " And you 've been a lawyer too long . Everything you say sounds like innuendo . " She reached into a silver case on the table and extracted a long brown cigarette . Putting it to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're here for ? " I lit her cigarette with a crystal lighter . " Two friends , " I replied , " a cop and a criminal defense lawyer . It 's a little like a gathering of the Hatfields and the McCoys . " " Is he with the San Francisco police ? " " She , " I replied , " is an assistant chief . He 's the lawyer . I introduced them . " She drew lazily at her cigarette . " Are they marrying in a church ? " I shook my head . " A civil ceremony . They 've rented out a bed-and-breakfast place on Alamo Square . Josh and I are staying there . " At the mention of my lover 's name , she gazed down at the milky surface of her coffee . " Will you be staying long ? " " Until Monday , " I said , adding deliberately , " Josh has to get back to school . He 's at UCLA . " Brushing the tip of her cigarette against the edge of an ashtray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned that once . " As if to forestall further discussion of Josh , she asked , " Do you like Los Angeles ? " " Most of the time . Our house is on a hill , too , like yours . I can see the Hollywood sign from the kitchen window . The other day Josh spotted a pair of deer in the underbrush . It 's not at all what I expected . " " Deer , " she repeated . " That 's interesting . " " Do you ever get down to LA ? " I asked . " No , " she replied . " I have no reason to . " I thought about that for a moment and let it pass . Tactless remarks were part of the price we paid for remaining strangers . That , and a finite store of small talk . I 'd exhausted mine . " You said you wanted to see me on a professional matter . Something going on ? " She set her cigarette down . " Not with me , " she replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " A dim image formed in my head of a tall , blonde , unlikable girl . " Vaguely . " " She married Paul Windsor . I think you knew his brother Mark . " I remembered Mark Windsor well , his younger brother Paul less well . The Windsors were local gentry in Los Robles . Mark and I had run track in high school . Miler , we called him , after his event . I had been infatuated with him . Paul had just been someone who got in the way when I was trying to be alone with Mark , little good that that did . " I remember them . " " Paul 's been arrested for murder . " This got a startled " Really ? " out of me . " Apparently he needs a lawyer , " she said , without a trace of irony . " I told her I 'd talk to you . " " Do they still live in Los Robles ? " " Yes . " " There is n't a town in California that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " including Los Robles . I suggest they start there . " Elena stroked her throat , a nervous gesture that went far back into our childhood . " Sara insisted on you . " " Why ? " She put out her cigarette decisively and said , " I do n't know very much about it , Henry . Sara was upset , and she 'd been drinking when she called me . The man Paul 's supposed to have killed was involved in child pornography . The police are saying it was because he was blackmailing Paul . Sara denied it . She- " " Wait , " I said . " Back up . What 's the connection between Paul Windsor and child pornography ? " Her fingers tugged her throat . " A few years ago Paul was arrested for-I do n't know what it 's called-child molesting ? " She forced her hand down . " The girl was fifteen , I think , but it had been going on for some time . " " Are you telling me that Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that word means . " I had heard her use that tone before . It implied that her ignorance was grounded in superior morality . " It 's a technical term , " I replied , " denoting someone who is sexually attracted to children . The street term is ' baby fucker . ' Continues ...
