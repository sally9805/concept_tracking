The house of tomorrow will be made of soda bottles  --  that 's how we best know the substance called PET , or polyethylene terephthalate . But architects Stephen Kieran and James Timberlake see a much different use for the plastic : embedded with flat circuitry that will enable walls to store heat , generate electricity and double as giant , flat-panel displays . Their iteration , called SmartWrap , could also make the building process faster and cheaper than ever . <P> The smarts in SmartWrap come from flat circuitry called OLEDs ( organic light-emitting diodes ) , which are tattooed onto the plastic by an ink-jet printer and can function either as a light source or a computer display . When used on an exterior wall , OLEDs could transform the look of your house in seconds . " You could have a blue house one day and a green house the next day , " says Timberlake . " You could have a camouflage pattern or political signage . " Insulation is provided by gel-filled pockets between two layers of SmartWrap ; power can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are also printed on . <P> Timberlake says SmartWrap evolved from the realization that " even though there has been an explosion of new materials and processes , only a small number of architects apply them . " Because SmartWrap can be produced in bulk and individualized for any building , its inventors hope it will be more widely adopted by builders seeking a lightweight , flexible material .
