<p> XIAMEN , China  --  The skyline and bustling suburbs of this coastal city show how much China has to lose if it goes to war with Taiwan : Office towers rise above the busy waterfront , one crowned by a Pizza Hut with a dazzling view of the sea . <p> A $ 145 million convention center is almost finished . Factories in the suburbs of this city of 1.2 million people employ tens of thousands of workers in businesses as diverse as petrochemicals and jewelry . <p> Over the past two decades , investors from Taiwan have financed an economic transformation in Xiamen and the rest of the southern Fujian province , once an economic backwater . Since 1982 , the Taiwanese have poured $ 3.5 billion into more than 1,660 projects in Xiamen , located 140 miles from Taiwan directly across the Taiwan Strait . <p> Overall , Taiwanese investors have committed more than $ 40 billion to China since economic relations between the two resumed in the early 1980s . Two-way trade exceeds $ 25 billion a year . " Relations between us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhi , a Xiamen trade official . " There is no disharmony . " <p> The same can not be said for government-to-government ties . Relations between China 's Communist government in Beijing and the democratically elected leaders in Taipei are volatile . <p> When Mao Tse-tung 's Communists took over China in 1949 , Chiang Kai-shek and his vanquished Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan . There they set up a rival Chinese government and vowed one day to retake the mainland . <p> The government in Taiwan has long dropped its plans to reconquer mainland China , though it still talks of reunifying peacefully one day . But the Communist government in Beijing continues to regard Taiwan as another Chinese province and wants to take it back  --  by force if necessary . <p> Two-pronged strategy <p> Taiwan 's people , however , are in no hurry to rejoin the mainland . They live in a lively , multiparty democracy , a sharp contrast to the mainland where the Communists refuse to share political power and regularly arrest those who challenge their authority . <p> Taiwan 's standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product exceeds $ 12,000 a year , vs. less than $ 800 on the mainland . The Taiwanese like what they have  --  de facto independence  --  but do n't want to provoke a conflict by declaring independence outright . <p> They might not be able to avoid conflict . Last month , Beijing threatened to attack Taiwan if it postpones indefinitely reunification talks . The warning seemed designed to influence Taiwan 's presidential election Saturday , specifically to frighten Taiwanese voters into rejecting the candidate from Taiwan 's pro-independence party . <p> However , war would deliver a heavy blow to China 's economy . Foreign investment fell nearly 10% last year and probably would collapse if fighting broke out in the Taiwan Strait . Last year 's $ 40 billion in total foreign investment seems insignificant in a Chinese economy that had a GDP esimated at $ 4 trillion in 1998 . But China is counting on foreign investors to finance ventures and create jobs at a time when its inefficient , government-owned companies are shedding millions of workers in an effort to make themselves competitive . <p> Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's exports . <p> Coastal cities such as Xiamen are particularly dependent on investment from Taiwan . So Chinese leaders are engaged in a bizarre two-pronged strategy : intimidating Taiwan 's political elite with threats of war while soothing its business class with promises to protect investments . <p> Last year , China 's legislature , the National People 's Congress , beefed up a law to defend the rights of Taiwanese investors in the mainland . <p> During the latest furor over Chinese threats , the official Beijing newspaper China Daily announced a $ 300 million automotive joint venture with Taiwan that would bring 10,000 jobs to Fujian province over the next 10 years . China , which usually fights to keep Taiwan out of international organizations , has also signaled a willingness to let Taiwan into the World Trade Organization , which sets and enforces trade rules . <p> The reason : Entry into WTO would force Taiwan to tear down trade barriers that limit Chinese agricultural exports to Taiwan and contribute to its trade surplus with the mainland . <p> Chinese leaders are " sensitive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict , " says Christopher Howe , an economist at the University of London 's School of Oriental and African Studies . " But the military and some political leaders seem willing to ignore the economic costs . " <p> For Xiamen and Fujian province , " war would be a disaster , " says Jean-Pierre Cabestan , director of the French Center for Research on Contemporary China , which is based in Hong Kong . " The mainland Chinese side has so much to lose in this one . " <p> Hostilities with Taiwan are nothing new to Fujian . After the Communists took over China , they labeled the province the " frontline of coastal defense " against Taiwan . In 1958 , Chinese troops in Xiamen shelled the Taiwanese-controlled islands of Jinmen and Matsu , just off the Fujian coast . Fujian 's frontline position , however , also stunted its economic growth because the Communists did not want to invest heavily in a province so vulnerable to attack . <p> In 1979 , Fujian  --  like all of China  --  began to open to the outside world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic results . In 1978 , Fujian 's economy was the 22nd-biggest among China 's 29 provinces ; by 1992 , it was No. 11 . <p> Foreign-owned firms , including Taiwanese firms , account for 80% of Xiamen 's industrial output . Many are like the factories outside Xiamen where workers assemble toys , jewelry and plumbing fixtures from pieces shipped from Taiwan . Finished products usually are exported to the USA , Europe or Japan . <p> Ties that bind <p> Such a close relationship was perhaps inevitable . Fujian is tied to Taiwan by history and culture . Nearly 80% of Taiwan 's 22 million people trace their ancestry to this province . <p> Xiamen trade official Li Liu Quan cheerfully admits that local officials often give Taiwanese companies an advantage over foreign firms in the competition for business projects . <p> For Taiwanese investors , the benefits of doing business in Fujian , as well as the rest of China , are obvious . Unlike their own tight labor market , in which unemployment is about 3% , the mainland has a vast pool of workers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> China , population 1.2 billion , officially has an unemployment rate of about 10% , although the real figure is believed to be far higher . <p> Chinese workers will also work at a fraction of a Taiwanese salary . A blue-collar worker in Fujian earns about $ 110 a month , compared with more than $ 900 in Taiwan , says Simon Hsu , an executive with tire valve manufacturer Lu Hai Industrial Corp. , based in Taiwan . <p> However , there is a downside . The mainland workforce is largely unskilled . And Taiwanese firms must contend with corrupt Chinese officials and legal uncertainties because Taiwan and China do n't recognize each other 's laws . <p> Moreover , Taiwan forbids direct transportation links with the mainland . Travelers between China and Taiwan must make a stopover at a third site , usually Hong Kong . That turns what would be a 200-mile trip into 800 miles . <p> Cheng Xin , a Xiamen trade official , complains that it takes a full day for her to get to Taipei , including a stop in Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xiamen would take less than an hour . <p> If relations improve , that could change . Taiwan politicians are advocating a direct air link to the mainland . Although most goods also must take the long route , there is a limited but rapidly growing experiment to ship products directly between Xiamen and the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung . <p> The prospect of war , however , has thrown closer ties into doubt . " Most of the people in Taiwan , but also in China , they do n't want to fight , " says Hayes Lou , an official with a Taiwanese trade association in Dongguan , China , south of Fujian . But he worries that leaders in China and Taiwan wo n't prevent it . " Politics is politics . Their thinking is different from ours .
