<p> Peter Applebome was facing a new millennium and was about to turn 50 when his son joined the Boy Scouts and he decided to tag along . <p> Was it a midlife crisis or a case of New Age Dad angst ? <p> Probably a little of both , says the self-proclaimed " committed indoorsman . " Applebome , a New York Times writer and editor , says he followed in the footsteps of his son . <p> In his heart , he had always envisioned Little League stardom for Ben , born in Houston when Applebome was the Times ' national correspondent , then bureau chief here . <p> But Ben loved the idea of camping and hiking , and what seemed like a passing fancy became a passion for the outdoors and Scouting . <p> Applebome went to a meeting in Chappaqua , N.Y. , where they now live , and ended up hooked . <p> His recently published book Scout 's Honor : A Father 's Unlikely Foray Into the Woods chronicles his experiences with the sometimes controversial world of Scouting . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walk in the Woods , with the addition of a " bunch of goofy 13-year-olds . " <p> Were you ever a Scout as a kid ? <p> I was not a Boy Scout for a second , I was not a Cub Scout for a second . I never gave it a moment 's thought . It was nerdy and too conservative , not my world . I played ball , and that 's what I liked to do . <p> What changed your mind ? <p> I came to see that I really liked Scouting 's values . I liked the fact that it is one of the few things kids do that is generally cooperative and not competitive . I came to see it is one of the few things that you actually do with your kids . <p> What made you decide to write a book on Scouting ? <p> I did my last book in 1996 ( Dixie Rising ) , and I was on the lookout for another idea . It immediately hooked me as something that was interesting on lots of levels and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What were the different levels of interest ? <p> I was fascinated by Scouting as this great big iconic part of America that we think we know but we really do n't . It also seemed like a great window into the lives of boys and men , how they relate and what they worry and think about . <p> Then I learned more about the Boy Scouts of America and the current controversies . Scouting is in a lot of trouble , its enrollment is falling , and that interested me . <p> How did the experience affect your relationship with Ben ? <p> I think of the book most importantly as a really sweet father/son story . It 's more about fathers and sons than scoutmasters and Scouts . When we moved from Atlanta to Chappaqua , I was stricken with " bad dad guilt , " I had uprooted him from his happy home and his friends . So , finding a Scout troop , which was a big part of his life in Atlanta , was a way to ease his transiton . I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as kids often do - led me to this totally unexpected place where I found a lot of merit and value . <p> Did it make the two of you closer ? <p> We were always quite close , but it was a great thing we experienced over an extended period of time and we will always remember it . Doing the book was an important part because he was my editor and fact checker . <p> So Ben was n't embarrassed about you writing the book ? <p> I 'm biased , but he was amazing throughout the whole thing . One of the real perils was when your son is 11 , you say : " Hey Ben . I 'm going to do a book about your Boy Scout trooop and he says : ' Great ' . " And then when he 's 16 and the book comes out , he says : " You are going to do what ? " <p> He was totally enthused about the project and he was an incredible sport because at the very beginning I sort of deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spectator sports and he wo n't watch the Duke games with me . <p> And the others in the troop were OK with it ? <p> Ben had been reading excerpts at the troop meetings and they loved it . Their one big complaint is that they are in it as pseudonyms and they wanted their real names used . <p> What was your first Scouting experience like ? <p> It was a goofy canoeing trip . They taught us the basic stroke , and I thought I was getting it . They also tell you all the horrible things that can happen - one terrifying warning after another . One of the worst things you can do is get stuck on a rock , because a canoe can overturn and it will be filled with 20 tons of water in seconds and you will almost certainly either drown or die of hypothermia . <p> We got in the canoe , and in the first 15 seconds I got stuck on a rock , and I 'm thinking that if Ben and I drown , I will go down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kind of got it and we had this lovely excursion down the Delaware River . <p> What about camp-outs ? <p> Our first camp-out was this great fun bonding experience . It 's the only time in everyone 's life that you sit around with nothing to do and the deal is just to talk . It was sort of like the neighborhood bar in the woods , with bad coffee . <p> What do you think are the good points of Scouting ? <p> I think the fundamentals of Scouting , particularly the 12 items of the Scout law - a Scout is trustworthy , friendly , helpful , courteous and the rest of it , are wonderful.Where do you stand on the Scout policies excluding gays and atheists ? <p> I think they are wrong in a big way on the issue of gays and atheists . The BSA talks about the fact that they have to stand up for their fundamental values . But I think their fundamental values are the Scout law and the sense of decency and inclusion that Scouting is all about . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling that the BSA can exclude gays ? <p> I disagreed with it strongly and questioned whether I would stay involved . But Scouting was so much a part of my son 's life . I felt that in lots of ways this was more of an argument among adults than a real-world factor in the life of kids . Many troops , like ours , have nondiscrimination policies . So this is a case where national policy does n't translate to the local troops . <p> If you disagree , the best way to change an organization is to try to change it from within . <p> So you think troops in different parts of the country can have different identities ? <p> There is the national organization , based in Irving , Texas , and there is the image they display . But the individual troop is its own little universe . One of the real fun things about being at Scout camp is you see each troop as sort of a reflection of its own community or Scoutmaster . <p> What was your worst experience ? <p> Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware River . By the time we were ready to get in the rafts , it was pouring . So you have three hours of trying to paddle a raft in this drenching rain in 50 degrees . We were drenched from head to toe , and I was stuck in the raft with two tiny little kids who really were turning blue and this one unbelievably loquacious Eagle Scout who would n't shut up for a minute . I thought it would never end . <p> And the high point ? <p> There were two high points , one a totally unexpected experience at summer camp , where both the troop and I won awards . The other was a hike on Hunter Mountain ( in New York ) . We started off , and the temperature was in the low 50s . Midway through the hike we saw little bits of snow . When we got up , there was 3 to 5 inches of snow and a 50-foot-tall fire tower you could climb . It was like hiking from one season to another . <p> Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the uniforms . They work fine for Cub Scouts , but not a lot of Boy Scouts . <p> Embrace diversity : It would be great , for instance , to pair a high-income troop in River Oaks with an inner-city minority troop . It 's a great way for kids to get together on common ground .
