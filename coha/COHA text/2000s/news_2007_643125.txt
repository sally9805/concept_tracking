<p> CANCUN , MEXICO - Hardly a palm tree branch is astray in this showy resort city that 15 months ago was still clearing the rubble left from Hurricane Wilma . <p> On the beach , the fine white sand that was swept out to sea is back , thanks to a $20 million dredging project funded by the federal government . <p> While on the surface the new Cancn largely resembles the resort known to millions of tourists before the hurricane in October 2005 , many hotels and restaurants used this as an opportunity to upgrade . <p> Some made repairs , but others tore out what was left of the old and started anew with an eye toward raising revenues and competing with opulent new resorts to the south along the Riviera Maya . <p> " The hurricane was a bad nightmare , " said Javier Aranda , the undersecretary for promotion at the Tourism Secretariat of the State of Quintana Roo . " We could have cried , but instead we created an opportunity to redo it well and make it better . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent clientele , and many hotels are trying to move away from spring breakers . <p> The goal is to create an identity associated more with quiet luxury than loud parties , seeking to draw more family and convention-oriented business . <p> The Palace Resorts chain , for example , whose Beach Palace hotel suffered acute damage , rebuilt entirely and is promoting its upgrades . <p> The Ritz-Carlton , where broken windows and severe water damage forced it to close for 11 months , added features while rebuilding . The biggest was a culinary center offering two cooking classes six days a week in a facility with top-of-the-line Viking equipment . Guests can choose between classes with names like Tuscan Dinner Party , Real Mexican and Best of Barbecue . <p> " This is for people for whom cooking is recreational . A lot of people do n't cook at all anymore , and it 's a different and appealing activity while they 're on vacation , " said Rainer Zinngrebe , the German-born executive chef and creator of the center . <p> Ninety-five percent of Cancn 's hotels changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all upgraded , said Jesus Almaguer , president of the Association of Cancn Hotels and commercial director of Oasis Hotels . This has allowed them to raise prices between 5 and 20 percent . <p> " Most hotels are turning a profit again , although some are still carrying an economic weight from paying out extra sums in the remodeling , " Almaguer said . <p> A local hotel analyst also saw benefits from the changes but pointed out this is a long-term process . <p> " My sense is that most of the hotels are maintaining the prices they had before the hurricane and some are raising them , because the guests are essentially getting a new product : new beds , new sheets , etc. , " said Sergio Gonzlez , president of Acti Consultants , a tourism consultancy based in Cancn . " There will be the typical promotions in the low season , but overall I do n't think anyone is lowering prices . " <p> But the number of visitors this year may be affected by new U.S. policies requiring travelers visiting Mexico to carry passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 percent occupancy , but that has mostly to do with the new requirements for passports in the United States , " Gonzlez said . " We expect that July will be a very good month this year , and that next winter will be very good . " <p> Hurricane Wilma , which struck Cancn head-on and damaged the nearby resort areas of Cozumel and the Riviera Maya , dealt a blow to Mexico 's tourism industry , the third-largest source of revenue after oil and remittances . More than 3.3 million visitors came to Cancn in 2004 , the best year in the resort 's 33-year history , according to the Cancn Conventions &; Visitors Bureau . In the wake of the disaster that number dropped to 2.2 million in 2006 . <p> Nearly all of Cancn 's 70 beachfront hotels suffered damage ; some were forced to close . The rebuilding process , according to local tourism officials and businesspeople , was painful , but the millions of dollars invested helped to make it speedy . <p> As of the end of January , Cancn had 23,500 available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tourism Secretariat estimates 27,000 rooms will be available by April , restoring the resort to its pre-hurricane capacity . <p> The United Nations World Tourism Organization , a Madrid-based organization that promotes tourism and tourism ethics , has recommended that other tourism offices use Cancn 's rapid recovery program as a blueprint in the face of disasters . <p> " Without the recuperation of the beach and the remodeling of Boulevard Kukulcan paid for by the federal government , Cancn would not have been attractive again , " Almaguer said . " These were the most important tourism projects in the history of tourism in Mexico . " <p> Almaguer added that individuals , including local businesspeople , big hotel companies and other service providers , also played a crucial role . <p> " We suffered a lot with the delay in the insurance money and had to use our own resources and credit , " Almaguer said . <p> These transformations also presented staffing challenges . <p> " Some hotels have had to bring in their management staff , chefs and executives from other countries like Europe , but Cancn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gonzlez said . <p> The transformation of the Melia Turquesa into the ME by Melia shows how far this can go . The Melia Turquesa was an all-inclusive resort that catered to families and offered theatre and shows . <p> Only the shell of the old Turquesa 's pyramid structure was saved in the construction of ME ; everything else was gutted , said ME general manager Ernesto Luna . <p> ME by Melia is a newly minted brand with a different philosophy altogether . From the cucumber and melon aromas that waft through the lobby to the chill-out techno music that plays in every corner to the Asian Bistro , the $30 million , five-star ME is after the style-conscious , jet-setting members of Generation X and Y who have money to burn and like to be pampered . <p> Restaurants in Cancn also took the opportunity to remodel . Casa Maguey , formerly OK Maguey , changed its menu and atmosphere from casual to fine dining by adding white tablecloths and expanding its tequila selection . <p> Some tourists who are not part of the ME 's target market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost is $235 per night . <p> While some people like Aranda of the Tourism Secretariat say spring breakers are welcome in Cancn and are an important market segment , others say that their raucous behavior is a negative that should be discouraged . <p> " The spring breakers represent 1 percent of Cancn 's total tourism , but they make noise as though they were 90 percent , " said Patricia Lopez , public relations director for the Cancn Conventions &; Visitors Bureau . " You 'll notice that there are no spring breakers in our marketing materials ; they are a burden on the destination . " <p> A few years ago , close to 40 hotels welcomed spring break college groups . This year only nine will likely be actively courting them , the bureau said . <p> Still , ads for events that draw students - foam parties and bikini contests - are still plastered on the entrances to some bars and clubs in the Plaza Flamingo shopping mall in the hotel zone . <p> But Aranda said Cancn 's makeover should attract more families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery , and we are returning as one of the best places in the tourism field , " Aranda said . <p> HOTEL MARKET <p> The number of rooms for two tourist regions in Mexico : <p> Cancn <p> 2004 : 27,522 <p> 2005 : 11,192 <p> 2006 : 23,824 <p> Riviera Maya <p> 2004 : 23,512 <p> 2005 : 26,980 <p> 2006 : 31,397 <p> Sources : Hotel Association of Cancn , Riviera Maya Tourism Promotion Trust## Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
