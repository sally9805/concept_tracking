<p> On the Internet , nobody knows you 're a human  --  until you fill out a captcha . <p> Captchas are the puzzles on many Web sites that present a string of distorted letters and numbers . These are supposed to be easy for people to read and retype , but hard for computer software to figure out . <p> Most major Internet companies use captchas to keep the automated programs of spammers from infiltrating their sites . <p> There is only one problem . As online mischief makers design better ways to circumvent or defeat captchas , Web companies are responding by making the puzzles more challenging to solve  --  even for people . <p> They are twisting the letters , distorting the backgrounds , adding a confusing kaleidoscope of colors and generally making it difficult for humans . <p> " They are creating tests that a reasonably healthy adult ca n't pass , " said Gordon Weakliem , a programmer and blogger from Denver , who says he failed to correctly discern the captcha code several times last week on the sign-up page for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for computers and more difficult for real people , several Internet companies , including Microsoft and eBay , are working on replacements . <p> " You can make a captcha absolutely undefeatable by computers , but at some point , you are turning this from a human reading test into an intelligence test and an acuity test , " said Michael Barrett , the chief information security officer at PayPal , a division of eBay . " We are clearly at the point where captchas have hit diminishing returns . " <p> If that is true , at least captchas had a good run . Though several researchers devised similar tests early in the decade , credit for inventing the technology usually goes to Carnegie Mellon University , which was asked by Yahoo in 2000 to create a method to prevent rogue programs from invading its chat rooms and e-mail service . <p> University researchers devised a collection of cognitive puzzles that they knew modern computers could not solve . They called their approach the Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart , or captcha for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turing , who did research into ways to tell man from machine in the 1950s . <p> Captchas quickly became popular online and soon expanded into new dimensions . When advocates for the visually impaired complained that some people could not read the puzzles , many sites added audio versions , where a computer voice recites a string of letters and numbers , often over noises in the background . <p> The emergence of the technology started a wave of research into ways to make computers smart enough to crack the puzzles . <p> Yet some of that activity can be ethically murky . Aleksey Kolupaev , 25 , works for an Internet company in Kiev , Ukraine , and in his spare time , with his friend Juriy Ogijenko , he develops and sells software that can thwart captchas by analyzing the images and separating the letters and numbers from the background noise . They charge $100 to $5,000 a project , depending on the complexity of the puzzle . <p> Mr. Kolupaev said he had worked both for legitimate companies that want to test their own security and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is unbreakable , and each system has its own weakness , " he said . " If you create a program that only recognizes one picture from a hundred , it 's not a problem . You just hit the site 100 times , and you break through . " <p> On his Web site , ocr-research.org.ua , Mr. Kolupaev boasts of cracking the captchas of companies like MySpace and PayPal ; the site also ranks the effectiveness of each captcha . He says he believes that his work makes the Internet more secure because companies tend to improve the captchas that he critiques . <p> Internet companies have responded to these challenges by making their captchas more complex . On YouTube , for example , the letters and numbers in the captcha float on an uneven grid of colors . On the technology news site Slashdot , random squiggly lines slice through the letters and numbers , as if a child had scrawled with a pen on each puzzle . <p> All these tricks are attempts to disguise the boundaries of the characters , so that software can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures prove too tough for humans to decipher as well . On Ticketmaster 's site , the characters appear over a grid of diagonal lines that are so thick that they often obscure the puzzle . Jacob Hanson , the chief technology officer of HireVue , an online employment agency in Salt Lake City , estimated that he had failed to solve the Ticketmaster captcha once every four times . <p> " I can only imagine someone like my mom trying to go through it , " he said . <p> As a result , the hunt is on for puzzles that are friendlier to humans and more difficult for computers . Many researchers are focusing on expanding the test beyond the constrained realm of 26 letters and 9 digits . <p> Microsoft researchers have developed an alternative captcha that asks Internet users to view nine images of household pets and then select just the cats or the dogs . <p> " For software , this is wildly hard , " said John Douceur , a Microsoft researcher . " Computers are tripped up by all the photos at different angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different positions . " <p> The project , called Asirra ( for Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access ) , uses photographs of animals from Petfinder.com , a site that finds homes for homeless pets and has more than two million images in its database . <p> Other companies prefer to keep their next-generation captcha research quiet . Mr. Barrett of PayPal will say only that the new breed of captchas might resemble simple image identification puzzles , like asking users to view pictures of a head of lettuce , a tree and a whale  --  and pick out the vegetable . <p> " Captchas have gotten as good as they are going to get , and it is likely they are going to be slowly supplanted with a different technology that achieves the same thing , " he said . <p> He added : " No single defensive technology is forever . If they were , we would all be living in fortified castles with moats . " <p> Not everyone feels that the traditional captcha is finished . Luis von Ahn , a professor at Carnegie Mellon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently unveiled an effort to give them new usefulness . <p> His reCaptcha project ( recaptcha.net ) seeks to block spam while handling the challenge of digitally scanning old books and making them available in Web search engines . <p> When character recognition software fails to decipher a word scanned in a book  --  when the page is yellowed or the letters are smudged , for example  --  Mr. von Ahn 's project makes it part of a captcha . After the mystery word has been verified by several people , it is fed back into the digital copy of the book . <p> " I heard that 60 million captchas are solved every day around the world , which first made me quite happy for myself but then quite sad , " he said . " It takes about 10 seconds to solve a captcha , so that means humanity is wasting thousands of hours solving them . I wanted to do something good for humanity in that time .

Computers can use line width to separate characters from noise . YOUTUBE Since color areas are all straight , picking out characters is not that difficult for a computer .
