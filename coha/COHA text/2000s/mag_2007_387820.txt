Headnote No fads-just three plans that get results . // For celebrities , dieting can be as much a part of the job as rehearsing lines or doing the talk-show circuit . As Elizabeth Hurley once said , " Being able to squeeze myself into tiny clothes is how I earn my living . " While it 's true that a few celebs will succumb to the occasional fad ( a juice fast before the Oscars , for example ) , some of the fittest , sexiest luminaries employ healthy , balanced strategies for losing weight . ( Bonus : This approach only enhances their star power . Who can look radiant and happy after depriving themselves ? ) For your consideration ... three weight-loss plans that will have you looking red-carpet-ready-for life . by Anne Marie O'Connor photography by Tina Rupp 1 zone delivery When you 're cutting calories , every mouthful counts . Which is where Zone delivery services come in , providing calorie-controlled gourmet meals based on The Zone , the mega-selling 1995 book by Barry Sears , Ph.D . Each meal is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " carbs , 30 percent lean protein , and 30 percent healthy fat . Several companies offer this heat-and-eat plan , including Zone Chefs , which delivers in the New York and Los Angeles areas . Every morning , three freshly prepared meals and two snacks , tucked in insulated bags , appear on your doorstep . ( It also offers a frozen food option , which allows you to order a week 's worth of meals at once . ) Why celebs love it For the Hollywood elite , the convenience ca n't be beat " It can be helpful when people are extra busy and do n't have easy access to healthy food , " says Elyse Resch , R.D. , a Beverly Hills-based nutritionist . There 's no counting calories or points , guessing at serving sizes , or keeping a food diary-the service does all the work . Many stars use it to jump-start weight loss when they 're prepping for a movie role or , like Cindy Crawford , just after giving birth . Others have meals delivered when they 're on location or while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare . Make it work for you A day 's worth of Zone delivery meals may contain too few calories ( 1,200 to 1,400 ) for some active women , says Resch . An easy fix : Add a piece of fruit , some vegetables , or a slice of wholegrain bread to every meal ( you can also order extra salads from Zone Chefs ) . The biggest hurdle to signing on for Zone delivery , however , is the price , which ranges from $25 to $50 a day . But following the diet on your own is n't hard . Zonediet.com offers meal plans , recipes , shopping lists , and more . Find the 40-30-30 concept too confusing ? Think of this simple visual : On one third of the plate , place a palm-size serving of lean protein ; fill the orner two thirds with fruits , vegetables , and whole grains . Round out the meal by adding a small amount of " good fat , " such as olive oil , nuts , or avocado . 2 the mini-meal plan It 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Jorge Cruise , the San Diego-based author of The 3-Hour Diet and The 3-Hour Diet Cookbook , and one of Hollywood 's biggest proponents of a frequent-eating diet strategy . " Eating every three hours revs up your metabolism and stabilizes blood sugar levels , " he says . " That , in turn , keeps your energy up and appetite in check . " The keys to the 3-Hour Diet : " Eat within an hour of getting up , then every three hours afterward , and your last meal no fewer than three hours before you go to bed , " says Cruise . Though the emphasis is on the timing , Resch points out that the real reason stars lose weight even though they 're eating often is that they 're consuming only around 1,500 calories per day : a 400-calorie breakfast , lunch , and dinner , two 100-calorie snacks , and a 50-calorie treat . Still , Resch agrees that the mini-meal approach is a smart way to drop pounds . " If you wait too long between meals , you 're likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor choices or overeat , " she says . Why celebs love it This diet gives them the energy to power through long days of filming , interviews , and meetings-not to mention tough workouts . Beverly Hills personal trainer Gunnar Peterson recommends this mini-meal approach to all his clients , including Jennifer Lopez , Brooke Burke , and Amber Valletta . Fueling your body regularly with frequent small meals " is more efficient at keeping your energy high . You need to put gas in the tank before you go on a ride , " he says . " It 's crazy how people come in to work out and they have n't eaten anything . They ca n't perform at their optimum level . " Denise Richards , who juggles a career and caring for two kids , is one of the many stars who relies on small , frequent meals to get through her days , which start with an hour-long workout with a personal trainer at 5 a.m . " Eating small meals with a balance of protein and fiber keeps me going , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , pancakes , toast , or whatever I 've made for the kids at 7 a.m . " At lunch and dinner , Richards has a salad with an olive oil-based dressing or foods she can eat on the run , like veggie burgers and quesadillas . Another reason stars like Angelina Jolie follow this method is that " it 's something they can do for the rest of their lives , " says Cruise . " Celebrities have to stay in the business-and stay fit and slender-for many years . Healthy , frequent eating is an easy way to maximize their appearance and energy levels . " Make it work for you While eating balanced meals is often a sage strategy for most people , " there 's no proof that three hours is the magic number , " says Resch . " Some people can go longer , some people ca n't go three hours " - and both can still lose weight . So instead of watching the clock , " tune in to your body 's own signals , " she advises . " If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . " But if you 're starving after two and a half hours , go ahead and have your next meal or snack . " It 's important to remember that a frequent-eating plan does n't give you carte blanche to chow down on chips and cookies all day long . For it to be an effective diet tool , you need to aim for a wide variety of nutrients at most meals-say , a cup of soup and a piece of fruit or half a sandwich and a small salad . And remember that the emphasis is on " mini , " cautions Cruise . The idea is to eat more often-not more food . 3 the natural foods plan The natural foods program is not a diet per se , but an eating philosophy , with as many variations as there are adherents . " It emphasizes fresh , whole foods that are minimally processed , locally grown , and organic whenever possible , " explains Los Angeles-based Akasha Richmond , caterer and author of Hollywood Dish : More Than 150 Delicious , Healthy Recipes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruits and vegetables , whole grains , beans , soy , olive oil , and dark chocolate . Devotees eschew artificial additives and sweeteners , trans fats , pesticides , hormones , antibiotics , bleached white flour , white sugar , genetically modified foods , and endangered seafood . A plan like this is extremely flexible ; though some followers are strict vegetarians , others eat dairy , fish , seafood , and even red meat and poultry . Alicia Silverstone , who has followed a plant-based diet for eight years , does n't consume any animal products , while Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow subscribe to a macrobiotic diet , which allows them to eat fish , as well as grains and veggies . Why celebs love it The food is delicious , good for you , and you 'll lose weight gradually without feeling deprived . Because the diet 's based on high-fiber foods like fruits , vegetables , and whole grains , you tend to feel satisfied on fewer calories , says Ashley Koff , R.D. , founder of the HealthXchange , a nutrition consulting firm in Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the easiest ways to pare down . " Followers also swear that abstaining from processed foods makes them feel better . " My energy levels changed dramatically when I went vegan , " says Alicia Silverstone , who reportedly served vegan treats ( tomato tarts with cashew cheese , grilled tempeh , and black rice ) at her 2005 wedding . " At first it was literally having more energy , and then it was having a " lighter energy ' ' - being more awake and more present , " she says . It 's not surprising , say experts . " For the most part , we 're simply going to be healthier if we 're eating whole grains , beans , lean protein , and fruits and vegetables , " says Koff . " Unlike many processed foods , they also contain micronutrients , such as iodine , selenium , and chromium , which enable the body to function normally . " Make it work for you Though the plan is replete with goodfor-you foods , it does n't give you license to eat as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion sizes , especially when it comes to higher-calorie items like nuts , tofii , cheese , oils , and grains , " cautions Koff . If you 're not eating animal products , you also need to make sure you 're getting adequate amounts of protein , iron , calcium , vitamins D and B12 , and other essential nutrients from supplements or fortified foods . To ensure you 're meeting your needs , you need to cast a wide nutritive net . For specifics , check out the American Dietetic Association 's Food Guide for Vegetarians at eatright.org . It can be time-consuming to prepare whole foods from scratch . To keep cooking to a minimum , whip up a big batch of grains once or twice a week , then simply add fresh veggies and lean protein . Seek out chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe 's to stock up on staples such as brown rice , dried fruit , and whole-grain pizzas . Another challenge is this diet 's reliance on organic foods , which can cost substantially more than nonorganic foods . If money 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to have nonorganic broccoli , " says Resch , " than no broccoli at all .
