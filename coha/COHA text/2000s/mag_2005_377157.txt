Companies trying to reach America 's expanding Hispanic population should listen to Julieta Parilla and her family . Parilla , who emigrated from Guadalajara , Mexico , with her relatives eight years ago , is preaching about Pampers . Sitting on a four-poster living-room bed in the cramped apartment she shares with her baby daughter , mother , sister , brother-in-law and five nieces and nephews in Norwalk , Calif. , a predominantly Hispanic working-class suburb of Los Angeles , she waxes eloquent about the diaper brand 's absorption abilities and its " softer cloth . " At a baby shower before her 6-month-old daughter Fatima was born , a friend gave Parilla a competing diaper as a gift . She regrets ignoring her sister 's advice to stay away from other brands . Those other diapers , she says , caused her daughter to break out in a rash . <P> Although the endorsement by her sister and prenatal nurses turned Parilla on to Pampers , a few marketing tactics from Procter &; Gamble , Pampers ' $51 billion parent company , have helped the 21-year-old single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pampers television ad she liked , broadcast in both English and Spanish , showing a smiling baby crawling in the diapers . The nurses at Garfield Medical Center in Monterey Park , Calif , gave Parilla free samples of Pampers and other P &G; brands like Crest and Tide as she checked out after Fatima 's birth ( Parilla uses Crest , although she prefers Cheer , another P &G; brand , to Tide ) . At a local health clinic , she picked up a copy of Avanzando con Tu Familia ( Helping Your Family Move Ahead ) , a P &G-published; Martha Stewart Living for recent Hispanic immigrants that reaches 1 million homes across the country . Besides coupons for P &G; products , the magazine prints recipes , exercise tips and other lifestyle advice . Parilla especially liked a story on how to clean the belly of your newborn , and she has been impressed by P &G's; support for the Hispanic Scholarship Fund . <P> With such clever tactics , Proctor &; Gamble has hooked Parilla and a whole lot of other Hispanic Americans . The Hispanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , and its buying power is soaring too . By most accounts , P &G; is leading the pack in the race to grab its business . Competitors like Colgate-Palmolive , which imported fabric softener Suavitel from Latin America , and Unilever , with grass-roots campaigns like storefront tastings for brands such as Hellman 's mayonnaise and Rag ? ? spaghetti sauce in Hispanic neighborhoods , are also active . But P &G; spent $107 million on Spanish-media advertising in the first nine months of 2004 , tops in the U.S. ( excluding Lexicon Marketing Corp. , which sells products that teach English to Spanish speakers ) . <P> Six of the 12 brands that P &G's; ethnic-marketing division manages are ranked No. 1 among Hispanics in their categories , and five others are ranked second . " Senior management has tested our will and challenged us to blanket the market , " says Graciela Eleta , director of P &G's; Multicultural Business Development Organization , a unit the conglomerate created in 1999 to reach African , Asian and Hispanic Americans . " We Hispanics like to see who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Alex L ? ? pez Negrete , president of Lopez Negrete Communications , a Houston-based Hispanic marketing company . " All the meat on the grill . That 's who wins . "
