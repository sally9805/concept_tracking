The idea was simple : To choose items that " F &S; editors found ... can make all the difference . " But would they make a difference to you , the reader ? The answer was a resounding yes , and we have been presenting these awards every year since . In 2005 , seven field editors did the tests , selecting gear they considered special . They used it , compared it with competitive products , then sent it to F &S's; offices , where the New York editors weighed in . Here , you 'll read what we consider to be the best gear introduced this year . The following 22 items all performed up to expectations and , in many cases , beyond . Their prices are reasonable and fair . Their designs are well thought out . And their usefulness to sportsmen is unparalleled . Federal Premium Vital-Shok TruBall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy . I had no trouble shooting 2-inch groups at 50 yards with 12-gauge TruBall slugs in a smoothbore . ( Most Foster slugs wo n't group tighter than 4 inches at 50 yards . ) What 's the secret ? A little plastic ball  --  which fits into the TruBall 's hollow base and sits in a dimple on the wad  --  keeps the slug centered in the bore as it expands upon firing . The ball also helps the wad and slug separate cleanly as they exit the muzzle . TruBalls are real tack-drivers by slug standards . What 's more , you get this revolutionary accuracy for only a dollar more per box than traditional Fosters . They come in 12-and 20-gauge and 12-gauge low-recoil versions . $5 per box of 5 ; 800-322-2342 ; federalcartridge.com Winchester .325 Short Magnum Battalions of shortfats have been introduced in the past few years , and everyone assumed that the next Winchester addition would be a .338 shortfat .

W/W offers a 180-grain Ballistic Silvertip at 3000 fps , a 200-grain AccuBond CT at 2900 , and a 220-grain Power-Point at 2800 . If W/W comes up with a 220-grain Fail Safe loading , that will transform a highly useful cartridge into a truly formidable one . $37-$53 per box of 20 ; 618-258-2000 ; winchester.com Shimano Torsa Designed for nearshore saltwater use , the Torsa has big , tough gearing , all nestled in a machined-aluminum frame , which produces unreal cranking power and gives room for a huge drag to tame everything from stripers to tuna . The lever-drag system allows you to use eight interchangeable cams that tune the reel for specific fish . Four models range in size from the TS16N ( narrow spool , 28.6 ounces , 300 yards of 14-pound mono ) to the TS30 ( 31.1 ounces , 420 yards of 25-pound mono ) . All have 5.8 : 1 gear ratios and adjustable centrifugal cast controls . It 's a top-of-the-line reel in every respect . $670-$700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viento 's premium features is headed by a Twitchin ' Bar , which lets you retrieve short lengths of line without cranking the handle . Thumbing the bar once slowly retrieves 4 inches of line  --  ideal for twitching . Other features include six ball bearings , a solid anti-reverse , Mag-force antibacklash control , a rigid aluminum frame , a fast 6.3 : 1 gear ratio , and an easily controlled perforated spool . At 8.3 ounces and holding 100 yards of 14-pound-test nylon , the Viento is light , and the price is right . $200 ; 562-802-9589 ; daiwa.com Greenhead Gear Full-Body Mallards With Real Motion Bases Making decoys that look real is difficult , and having them move like live ducks is a major accomplishment . Greenhead Gear succeeds on both counts with its full-body mallards . They come in feeding and active styles , with swiveling heads for different poses .

The key is in the waterproofing . Rivers West uses a proprietary membrane and stretchable exterior fabric that blocks water for as long as you stay outside . Unlike other garments that are breathable and waterproof , the seams are not taped ; they are sealed with an immersible thread that 's guaranteed not to fail . The fleece is ultraquiet at 60 or minus 10 degrees , and I have yet to puncture it . This is the first waterproof-breathable fleece that I would take to Alaska as a primary coat . Even if it rained for three days straight , I would still be bone-dry  --  it 's that impressive . $200 ; 800-683-0887 ; riverswest.com Ruger Gold Label This side-by-side shotgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the round-action guns of John Dickson , the Gold Label is wonderfully slim and light . At 61/2 pounds with 28-inch barrels , this 12-gauge is lighter and trimmer than many 20-gauges . I found the Gold Label easy to shoot well . It has just that smidgen of muzzle heaviness that makes a light gun swing smoothly through a target . The straight grip and splinter forearm keep the gun so low in your hands that it points like a sixth finger . It handles like a British best but sells for a price that many ordinary uplanders can afford . The Gold Label was announced in 2002 , but production problems kept it from dealer shelves until this year . $2,000 ; 928-541-8820 ; ruger.com Sako Quad Anyone who can learn to speak Finnish must be pretty clever , so it should be no surprise that the people at Sako came up with the idea of a rimfire rifle with interchangeable barrels . The gun comes in .22 LR , .22 WMR , .17 HMR , or .17 Mach 2 , or you can get all four as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured it out without even reading the directions . The Quad is a racy-looking synthetic-stocked rifle with an excellent trigger , 50-degree bolt lift , and color-coded barrels so you can tell one caliber from another . Accuracy is outstanding . Quads are expected to turn in 3/4-inch groups at 100 yards at the factory . $948 for one caliber ; $1,739 for four-barrel set ; 800-636-3420 ; beretta.com Rocky Revolver Hunting Boots Slip your feet inside these boots , turn the dial , and in two seconds they 'll fit you . Instead of laces , they use an innovative cable system that will not stretch , break , or freeze shut . An easy-to-grip dial engages the cable , tightening the entire boot in tiny increments . And there are no laces to come annoyingly untied . To remove , you push on the center of the dial to release the lock . The Revolvers wo n't win any beauty contests , but they provide a practical solution for getting boots on and off quickly and easily . $158 ; 740-753-1951 ; rockyboots.com Cabela 's Ultralight Extreme Hunter 4000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need enough pack to haul camp in and meat out .

But how would this **25;1672;TOOLONG pack stand up to a 26-mile expedition in Montana 's Beartooth Wilderness , where its papery fabric would have to tote a week 's worth of gear at 10,000 feet ? Very well , indeed , and the waterproof zippers lived up to their billing . With its cargo and spotting scope pockets removed , it also served double duty as a roomy daypack. $200 ; 800-237-4444 ; cabelas.com Mathews Switchback The 33-inch-long Switchback is quiet , easy to maneuver , and screaming fast , with an IBO speed rating of 318 fps .

The 34x16x13-inch bag has big 31/2-inch wheels that handle boat docks and sidewalks . Designed to remain upright when tilted on end , it has an extendable handle for easy hauling . Its lower half  --  enclosed by the molded hard bottom  --  has a protected compartment that can hold half a dozen multipiece rods , up to a four-piece 91/2-footer . The storage area is so rigid that I 've carried rods in their cloth bags without metal tubes , which saves space . Another large bottom section is sized to fit wading boots , and a third takes your vest , waders , and other gear . The soft upper portion has two clear-covered expanding sections that hold clothing . $300 ; 866-585-3570 ; simmsfishing.com CVA Kodiak Pro 209 Magnum This past spring I spent a week pounding across the dry foothills of the Argentine Andes on horseback .

It comes in blued and stainless-steel finishes . The ambidextrous , semisolid stock comes with a Quake Claw sling and a CrushZone recoil pad . Both .45 and .50 calibers are available . $333-$440 ; 770-449-4687 ; www.cva.com PowerBelt Bullets I hunt where using sabot-encased bullets for muzzleloader hunting is illegal . This is n't a problem now that I use PowerBelt bullets . Because they are .001 inch under bore , and the pliable plastic base is slightly over bore , the assembly loads easily and fits tightly over the powder . That , combined with a gas seal that eliminates blowby , yields consistent pressures and high velocities . Copper cladding on some PowerBelts reduces friction in the bore , further increasing velocity . The base also protects the tail of the bullet from flame cutting . Performance on game is awesome . In .45 , .50 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ring In the past , Leupold has offered excellent binoculars in the mid-price range , but never at the top levels of binocular-dom . Well , meet the Golden Ring , which is ( a ) brown ; ( b ) in the $1,000 bracket ; and ( c ) superb . I used a pair on a prairie dog hunt last June and was struck by the fact that they are not as light ( 29.5 ounces ) as other new glasses that go for similar money . A company rep explained that Leupold went for optical quality above all else , and that there are 22 lenses in each instrument ( a " glass-rich design , " he called it ) . Why brown ? " To be distinctive . " They are waterproof , optically and mechanically excellent , and backed by Leupold 's wonderful service and warranty system . $950 for 8x42 ; $1,000 for 10x42 ; 503-526-1400 ; leupold.com Bushnell Elite In 1987 the Elite binocular was the first to break the $1,000 barrier , and it was thought that sales would be limited . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , they came up with the money fast . At 23 ounces for the 8X model , these new Elites are lighter than their fore-bears . They are waterproof and incorporate every refinement in the way of lens and prism coatings for high light transmission and superior resolution . What sets them apart for hunters is the Rainguard coating on the exterior lenses , which means you can use them in a downpour . $950 for 8x43 ; $1,000 for 10x43 ; 800-423-3537 ; bushnell.com Zeiss Victory 32 T* FL Made in 8x32 and 10x32 , this new glass is about as small and light ( both models weigh 19 ounces ) as is possible for a full-size binocular . The weight savings is achieved through the use of a glass-fiber-reinforced polyamide casing . Optically , the Victory is gorgeous , due in part to the objective lenses being made from fluorite glass , which is rarely found in binoculars because of its cost but offers superb optical quality . These binoculars are so bright that they give away nothing to larger , heavier 42mm models . $1,400 ; 800-441-3005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bow-mounted electric trolling motor is history with Minn Kota 's new Lift-Assist mechanism . The trick : When you stow and deploy the powerful Maxxum Pro with the rope that comes with it , a gas-charged spring similar to that on a truck 's tailgate cuts the motor 's weight in half , reducing fatigue and saving potential missteps when you 're on the bow in rough water . The Maxxum Pro comes in two sizes , with a choice of shaft lengths , one for boats under 20 feet ( 24 volts , 80-pound thrust ) and one with more juice for heftier craft reaching the mid-20s ( 36 volts , 101-pound thrust ) . The new models go down  --  and up  --  easily and safely , with abundant power for positioning in wind and current . $900-$1,080 ; 800-227-6433 ; www.minnkotamotors.com Wheeler Engineering Deluxe Gunsmith Screwdriver Set Wheeler actually hired a gunsmith to take the dimensions of all the screw-head sizes commonly used in guns ( can you imagine anything more boring ? ) , and it paid off .

This is the best screwdriver set I 've ever used . $75 ; 877-509-9160 ; **30;1699;TOOLONG Water Strider Kick Boat Here is the answer for the globe-trotting angler : a boat that weighs so little ( 171/2 pounds ; 281/2 with oars , pump , and carry bag ) that you can pack it on a bicycle , check it as luggage at the airport , drop it out of a floatplane , and then pump it up bankside to run Class III water down any river on earth  --  all while carrying gear for a monthlong expedition ( it has a load capacity of 515 pounds ) .

This ATV has fuel injection , a differential lock , excellent brakes , and an impressive downhill engine braking system . It also has exceptionally low vibration . The King Quad is fast , has good low-end power , and comes with a 2-inch receiver that allows you to tow up to 992 pounds . This machine is a true work-horse , but it 's so easy to handle that even an inexperienced rider will feel comfortable on it . $7,300 ; 800-828-7433 ; suzukicycles.com Pirelli Rut Buster Tire Last summer I tested a new quad that came with an " upgraded " puncture-resistant tire that six out of 14 pro riders managed to flatten in one day .

Eighteen-year-old Delia Conisborough stirred slightly , her tumbled hair a glorious flame-red against the pristine whiteness of lace-edged bed linen . <br> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , much as she loved him , she did n't want him to wake . This was the morning that , as a bride of five days , she was to leave her childhood home and embark on the long journey to England and a lifestyle so different from anything she had previously known . There were goodbyes to be said . Not to people . They would come later when the Chandler clan descended on Sans Souci to wave them off as they left by train for Richmond . From Richmond there would be a longer journey to New York and then , most exciting of all , the five-day Atlantic crossing aboard the RMS Mauretania , the most luxurious liner afloat . <br> Still trying to come to terms with the realization that her surname was no longer Chandler but Conisborough and that she had a title , Viscountess -- though Ivor had explained to her she would generally be referred to as Lady Conisborough -- she swung her legs to the floor , her silk nightdress swirling about her ankles . It was n't yet six o'clock and she had at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her favorite horses and all her favorite places -- as well as to Sans Souci itself . <br> The bedroom she had been sharing with Ivor for the last four nights was not the bedroom she still regarded as being hers . That bedroom lay in the opposite wing of the house and she padded barefoot along the corridor toward it , plaiting her hair into a single waist-length braid as she did so . <br> " Mornin ' , Miss Delia , " said one of the servants , who had been at Sans Souci for as long as she could remember , as she passed him outside her father 's room . " Ah sure am sorry you be leavin ' us . " <br> " I 'm sorry too , Sam , " she said , not at all abashed at being clad only in her nightdress . " But my husband has promised we 'll be back for visits . " <br> She flashed Sam a dazzling smile and , if she had been dressed , would have hugged him . No one ever stood on ceremony at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken for granted , though Ivor had been shocked by it . <br> " Great Scott , Delia ! " he 'd said disbelievingly when first witnessing the way the Chandlers treated their staff . " You wo n't be able to behave like that in England . They would think you had taken leave of your senses ! " <br> Now in her old bedroom she smiled at the memory , pulling her nightdress over her head and then dragging her ankle-length riding skirt and her riding jacket from the closet . <br> Though she was only eighteen she had enough sense to know that it was her American ways that had captivated her new husband . He certainly had n't married her for her money . A handful of other aristocratic Englishmen , those with vast estates and little money to maintain them , had married American heiresses , but Ivor Conisborough did not fall into that category . Twenty-two years her senior , he not only came from an exceedingly distinguished family ; he had also been a financial adviser to King Edward VII , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the about-to-be-crowned King George V. As a consequence of his position and his aristocratic lineage he was very much a part of the royal circle . A royal circle of which she , as his wife , would also soon be a welcomed part . <br> As she pulled on her riding boots , excitement and anticipation flooded through her . Ivor 's visit to Virginia -- and his subsequent acquaintanceship with her father -- had changed her entire future . As daughter of one of the leading families of Virginia she would , of course , have married well and always lived comfortably , but there could be no comparison between the life she had expected and the life she was now about to lead . <br> Chandlers rarely saw any reason to leave Virginia and it was a foregone conclusion that if she had n't married Ivor , her future husband would have been a distantly related Chandler cousin , perhaps Beau Chandler , who was a cousin twice or three times removed . She could never remember which . Beau was handsome and fun into the bargain , but as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always fun of short duration . With Beau there would have been regular trips to White Sulphur Springs , a fashionable spa , and maybe even the occasional trip to Niagara , but there would certainly have been no Atlantic crossing and most certainly none of the sophisticated social life that lay ahead of her in London . A social life that would , in a few weeks ' time , include attending a coronation in Westminster Abbey . <br> In the stables she took her time saying goodbye to her father 's horses . Her father had always been a keen horseman . A member of the Deep Run Hunt , he had taught her to ride before she could walk . When Ivor had asked her to marry him , it had been her only query . " I shall still be able to ride ? " she had asked , her heart slamming hard against her breastbone . <br> " You 'll be able to ride every day in London , " he had said reassuringly in the clipped English accent that sent tingles down her spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily on Hyde Park 's Rotten Row . It 's a bridle path with stabling nearby . And if you want to hunt --  " <br> " I sha n't , " she had said , before he could finish . " Pa hunts . I never have . " <br> " You may change your mind when you find friends disappearing to Leicestershire every November , " he 'd said drily . " We 'll wait and see . One thing is certain : once people see how you take a horse over a five-foot gate fence , everyone will know what a superb rider you are . " <br> She had wanted to ask how far Shibden Hall , his family seat , was from Leicestershire . She knew it was in Norfolk but had no idea how far both counties were from each other , or from London . <br> " But London is where we shall be spending the most time , " she said now to her horse , Sultan , mounting him unaided . <br> Riding bareback , she cantered out of the cobbled yard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the air thick with the scent of summer . On mornings like these it seemed to her that the lush rolling Virginian countryside was as vast as all eternity . The softly rounded peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains were hazy in the distance and nearer were belts of thick woodland edging a swift-running river and half a dozen creeks . She knew the names of all the trees . Red maple , tulip , black gum , sassafras , hickory , dogwood , and sourwood . In autumn their leaves were a blaze of color . Now , in April , it was wildflowers that were at their best . <br> By the edge of the nearest creek she could glimpse the delicate pale mauve of wild geraniums and , beyond them , flashes of maroon-red trilliums and swath after swath of marsh marigolds , their deep-yellow petals glinting like gold . <br> She reined in Sultan and with the reins slack in her hands she stared at the landscape she loved . The trouble was , she also adored Ivor and Ivor 's life was in London -- and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rome and St. Petersburg as he was with New York and Washington . <br> That she was the wife of such a distinguished cosmopolitan man thrilled her . The moment she had been introduced to him she had been bowled over ; but he was of her parents ' generation , not hers . Even when her father told her that their visitor was a widower it had still not occurred to her that he might show romantic interest in her . <br> It had been her aunt Rose , her mother 's spinster sister , who had set out to catch his eye . Her mother , when Ivor had extended his stay in Virginia , had thought that perhaps Rose had a chance . Her father had always been far more perceptive . <br> " Lord Conisborough 's marriage was childless , " he 'd said when Delia had ever so casually brought up the subject of her aunt Rose 's hopes and aspirations . " When Conisborough marries again it will be to a woman much younger than Rose . He 'll want an heir and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Rose . I 'm afraid she 's going to be out of luck again . " <br> Her father was right , but when it became known that Lord Conisborough had asked for Delia 's hand in marriage , Rose had been poleaxed . <br> Delia , too , had hardly been able to believe it . <br> Her father had believed it , though , and had done so gleefully . " An English viscount ! A peer of the realm ! Dammit , girl ! I told you he 'd be looking for a young wife ! Wait until The New York Times gets hold of this ! They 'll have to describe us as Virginian aristocracy ! " <br> Her mother had been far more restrained . " He 's been widowed for only such a short time , Delia , " she had said , seated beside her on the edge of her bed , her hand holding her daughter 's . " And he is so much older . I 'd hate to think you were marrying because your head had been turned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has n't , " she 'd said adamantly . " I 'm marrying him because I 'm in love with him . I 'm marrying him because he 's different to any other man I have ever met or , living in Virginia , am ever likely to meet . He 's cultivated , sophisticated , intelligent -- and very good-looking . Do n't you think he is very good-looking ? " <br> Her mother thought of Ivor Conisborough 's chiseled features , the aquiline nose , the faint hollows under the cheekbones , the well-shaped mouth that betrayed an arrogance that could never be wholly hidden , the dark-blond hair , arrow-straight and silkily smooth , and had , with a marked lack of enthusiasm , agreed with her daughter . <br> As Delia now turned Sultan 's head in the direction of Sans Souci , she hoped her mother 's lack of enthusiasm was because Ivor was the complete opposite to her father . Always chewing on a plug of tobacco , her father was on the short side , no more than five foot eight or nine , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby , well-worn riding clothes , he seldom wore anything else and wherever he went there was a ruckus of talk and laughter . <br> Ivor was tall , at least two inches over six foot , favored Cuban cigars , and was accompanied on all his travels by a valet . His starched collars were higher than anyone else 's in Virginia and he always wore either a homburg or , in deference to the Virginian heat , a straw hat with his fashionable lounge suits . Exquisitely tailored though they were , Delia privately thought he never looked quite at ease in them . He was a man who suited formal clothing . In the frock coat and top hat he wore whenever they visited Richmond , he looked superb . <br> Unlike her father , he never spoke unless he had something pertinent to say , and there was something in his manner that commanded immediate respect . Even Beau , who had volubly declared he had no intention of fawning to English nobility , had referred to him as " Your Grace " on first being introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough with the way to address and introduce Ivor to know that Beau had made a social gaffe . <br> " Refer to me as Ivor or as Conisborough , " Ivor had said , tired of giving the instruction to Delia 's army of relations . " Only dukes are addressed as ' Your Grace , ' and then only by servants or anyone with whom they are having nonsocial communication . " <br> Unused to Ivor 's clipped way of speaking , Beau had interpreted the remark as a put-down and , refusing to let Delia persuade him otherwise , had vowed he would never forgive it . When she had married Ivor a month later in Richmond 's St. James 's Episcopal Church , Beau had been noticeable only by his absence . <br> Despite the sumptuousness of her silk-and-satin wedding gown , with its high bodice encrusted with seed pearls and its slim skirt and lavish train , it had n't been quite the extravaganza she had always imagined her wedding would be -- or the wedding her mother had always planned for her to have -- because it had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to return to England -- which I must do almost immediately in view of the forthcoming coronation -- and then travel back to Virginia for a spring wedding , " Ivor had said to her father in the tone of a man accustomed to getting his own way . " And it would be highly inappropriate for Delia to accompany me to England without doing so as my wife and it is not what she wants . " <br> It was n't what her father wanted either ; hence the speedy wedding that had set tongues wagging all over Virginia . <br> As she neared the hill that gave a perfect view of Sans Souci , Delia urged Sultan into a canter , still thinking of her husband and the intimidating effect he had on people . Sometimes even she felt a little intimidated by him , but common sense told her that it was natural when her respect for him was boundless and when he was , in so many ways , still a stranger to her . <br> Cresting the hill , she reined Sultan to a halt . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background of evergreen trees , Sans Souci lay cradled in a circle of lushly green hills . Near to the house were the paddocks and then , a little to one side , the stables and the various barns for the yearlings , the broodmares , and the winter foodstuffs . Beyond them lay the neat precision of apple orchards . <br> And dominating everything was the house . <br> It was a three-story brick-built colonnaded manor , its elegant Georgian windows flanked by pale-yellow shutters , a flight of stone steps leading up to its double front doors . The sun shimmered on its slate roof and honeysuckle fragranced the porch where her father and his friends liked to sit in the evenings , frosted mint juleps conveniently to hand . <br> It was the only home she had ever known and suddenly the prospect of leaving it caught at her throat . Sans Souci meant , in French , " without a care , " and her mother had ensured that since the day she had entered it as a young bride , it had lived up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reins . Though Ivor had told her they would be spending most of their time in London , she was sure that Shibden Hall would begin to play a large part in their married life once she had given Ivor an heir , and she was determined to turn it into the kind of home her mother had created at Sans Souci . A home that however impressively splendid , was also welcoming with fresh flowers in every room . A home where everyone who entered it instantly felt at ease . Most of all , a home where Ivor would want to be whenever he could get away from London and his court commitments . <br> As she gazed across the open meadowland , the double doors to the house opened . For a heart-stopping moment she wondered if she would see Ivor 's distinctively tall figure . She had been gone for nearly two hours and he would be up and dressed by now and wondering where she was . The thought of him walking into the meadows to greet her , as impatient to be with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excitement . <br> She dug her heels into Sultan 's flanks , but even as she did so she saw that it was n't Ivor stepping out onto the colonnaded porch : it was two of the servants hauling black traveling trunks . <br> Her disappointment was intense , but swiftly overcome . Any moment now the luggage would be loaded into one of the many horse-drawn buggies that would accompany them when they left Sans Souci for the local train station . It meant she had n't much time in which to bathe , eat breakfast , and change into her traveling clothes .
