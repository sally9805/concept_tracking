<p> It should be a no-brainer . <p> Georgia has its first opportunity to implement a commuter rail line from Lovejoy to Atlanta with nearly all of the money coming from federal sources . And if Georgia decides not to start its commuter rail program , it stands to lose about $100 million in federal money that is dedicated to this project . <p> Just that fact alone should stop the bickering . <p> But the other arguments for creating a commuter rail system are just as persuasive . It 's no secret that the Atlanta region has a serious traffic problem that will get worse as 2 million more people move here in the next 20 years . <p> Our highways and roadways already are congested . So there 's a dire need to build greater capacity to move people around the region . And no mode is more efficient to move people than rail . <p> There 's lots of talk about whether the region should chose rail or express buses . This either/or discussion is potentially dangerous because the Atlanta region desperately needs both if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution problems . <p> Ideally , Georgia would have implemented its entire commuter rail program by now , giving people choices of how to get around the greater metro area . That plan called for 425 miles of commuter rail that would have connected 55 communities in 24 counties . It would have had a spider-web network of lines reaching out from Atlanta to Canton , Gainesville , Athens , Madison , Macon , Senoia and Bremen . <p> The entire program would cost $2.2 billion , compared with the $20 billion currently proposed to have bus routes that would cover a much smaller area than commuter rail . <p> For years , Georgia has had plans on paper for commuter rail . For years , every roadblock , literally , has been put up to prevent commuter rail from becoming a reality . Until now . <p> Today , Norfolk Southern is willingly talking to the state about instituting a commuter rail line from Macon to Atlanta . With the money on hand , the state can start a 26-mile commuter line from downtown Atlanta to Lovejoy . <p> Rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( at an additional cost of between $50 million and $65 million ) and on to Macon , which would cost another $185 million . <p> Consider the numbers <p> Although it sounds expensive , consider this : For the $351 million it is expected to cost to have an Atlanta-Macon commuter rail line at a length of 103 miles , the state could build only 9.1 miles of HOV lanes or 18 miles of bus rapid transit , according to Doug Alexander , rail manager for the Georgia Rail Passenger Authority . <p> Then consider capacity . One eight-car commuter train can carry 1,120 passengers with a crew of one engineer and two conductors . It would take 23 buses with seating for 50 passengers ( and 23 drivers ) to haul the same number of people . And buses , like cars , use up precious pavement . <p> If the state really wants to maximize its investments in roadways , it should wholeheartedly support rail . The more options it gives commuters to get around , the better our highways will move traffic . <p> The Atlanta-Lovejoy line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 60 mph . The Georgia Department of Transportation , which should be commended for proposing and supporting this line , would improve road and rail crossings along the corridor . <p> Those investments would be long-term benefits to the state no matter what happens with commuter rail . <p> " It gives us a great opportunity to do something , " says Hal Wilson , administrator of intermodal programs for the Georgia DOT . " And we ca n't use the money for anything else . " <p> Investing in commuter rail is also a first step toward high-speed rail , a concept that has been embraced by chambers of commerce across the Southeast . In fact , Georgia is way behind some of its competitors  --  Florida , North Carolina and Texas  --  in building a passenger rail network . <p> The proposal sits on Gov . Sonny Perdue 's desk . He can make a lasting contribution to Georgia 's transportation system by finally getting the state to jump-start its commuter rail program . <p> The commuter rail line also will require the city of Atlanta to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forsyth Street to the state to help meet the local match . That transfer is still being held up in the City Council 's Transportation Committee . And that property is needed to build a bare-bones rail stop on the site of the multimodal station across from MARTA 's Five Points Station . <p> " We have not pushed as hard as we could have pushed , " Mayor Shirley Franklin admits . " Now that we have the main issue of water improvements behind us , it gives us the opportunity to have conversations on transportation , including multimodal and the Belt Line . <p> " I 'm interested in a network of rail that 's going to connect the commercial centers in the state , and I would like to see Atlanta be the major hub . Nothing would please me more than to be connected by rail and smart transportation . " <p> It 's true that people like trains . But trains have much less to do with the past and nostalgia than they do with the future . The most progressive cities in the world are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains , to promote rational land use and transportation flow . <p> And those communities understand that all modes of transportation require ongoing public funding : roads , buses , planes and trains . To force rail service to meet a non-subsidized test is grossly unfair , particularly compared with the investments governments make in all the other modes of transportation . <p> No alternatives to cars <p> The oddest argument to come from rail opponents is that people in the Atlanta region drive cars and do n't ride trains . Well , how can they ride trains if there are n't any ? How can we ever expect people to use alternative modes of transportation if the only form of regional transportation we have built is an extensive network of roads and highways ? <p> " We need fewer cars on the road , " says U.S. Rep. John Lewis ( D-Atlanta ) , who has been instrumental in securing the federal funds for this project . " I believe in rail . I would love to be able to ride from Atlanta to Lovejoy and from Lovejoy to Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be in operation by 2006 . <p> " We need to get started , " says state Rep. Doug Stoner of Cobb County . " Based on all the transportation projects out there , this is one of the most instantaneous we can do . I really ca n't see how this can not succeed . " <p> Last week , the Georgia Passenger Rail Authority passed a resolution in support of the Atlanta-Lovejoy line . <p> " I 've been on the authority for nine years , and this is the first concrete step we 've taken , " says Ross Goddard , who serves as secretary . <p> But the authority also got news last week that Perdue had slashed its budget in half  --  from $400,000 to $200,000  --  in his supplemental budget . And speculation is rampant that the governor will totally eliminate the authority in the budget he 'll present this week . <p> How odd it all is . Georgia finally has a fail-proof opportunity to begin its commuter rail program . And the very entity that is supposed to look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright spot here is the Georgia DOT . It is broadening its horizon beyond its highway department role to that of an agency that embraces multiple modes of transportation . <p> Since the opportunity for an Atlanta-Lovejoy train is a no-brainer , whatever decision is made by state leaders , including the governor , will speak volumes . <p> msaporta@ajc.com
