<p> After a baseball offseason marked by stars on the mend , wounded free-agent egos and hurt front-office feelings , the eternal theme of renewal resonates this spring . <p> Certainly , after pitchers and catchers report to spring training this week , much of the next six weeks will be occupied by the drudgery of cutoffs and relays , bunting and baserunning and pitchers fielding practice , also known as PFP . <p> But there will be plenty of intrigue and conflict , too . To get you ready for spring , USA TODAY 's Peter Barzilai and Gabe Lacques break down what to expect : <p> Five teams with star-studded issues <p> 1 San Francisco Giants : Fourteen games . That 's what the Giants got out of Barry Bonds last year , yet they still pushed the San Diego Padres to the last week of the season before dropping from contention . This spring , his right knee again figures to be the difference between mediocrity and prosperity and will be the most-watched limb in Arizona . The distraction of catching Babe Ruth looms just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To win it all in 2004 , reliever Keith Foulke and starter Curt Schilling essentially had to sacrifice 2005 . Now , the Sox hope Foulke 's knee is sound to take the heat off young relievers like Craig Hansen and Jonathan Papelbon . If Schilling 's celebrated right ankle is OK , a deep rotation becomes imposing with Schilling and newly acquired Josh Beckett at the forefront . <p> 3 Chicago Cubs : After a 79-83 season , the Cubs shuffled the top of their lineup , dealing Corey Patterson and acquiring Juan Pierre to jump-start things . But Pierre 's batting average fell 50 points and his on-base percentage dipped 48 in ' 05 . He 'll be flanked in the outfield by a first-year starter ( Matt Murton ) and a newcomer to the National League ( Jacque Jones ) . <p> 4 Los Angeles Dodgers : What should be a feel-good story  --  Nomar Garciaparra returning to his hometown  --  is clouded because Garciaparra has played at least 140 games just twice in five years and has never played first base . The boost provided when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could create friction when Jeff Kent , Garciaparra and reliever Danys Baez must shift roles in the middle of a season . <p> 5 Minnesota Twins : The cash-strapped Twins have been bleeding talent for years , and Gold Glove center fielder Torii Hunter will be a free agent after this season . His future  --  and that of the team , which can vacate the Metrodome after 2006  --  figures to be a talking point from Day 1 of camp . Five coming back from injury <p> 1 Brian Roberts , Baltimore Orioles : The second baseman hit 18 home runs and slugged .515 before tearing a ligament and tendon in his non-throwing elbow Sept. 20 . He has said he 'll be ready by opening day , but will the injury cause a backslide from his breakout year ? <p> 2 Eric Gagne , Los Angeles Dodgers : He avoided Tommy John surgery last summer , but the injury was significant enough to keep him off a mound until recently . The key for Gagne will be regaining enough zip on his fastball to make his changeup as feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 Scott Rolen , St. Louis Cardinals : Like others in this group , Rolen expects setbacks this spring , saying recently , " My point is , ( opening day ) April 3 is my date . " If he comes all the way back from left shoulder surgery , the Cardinals will be difficult to beat in the NL Central . <p> 4 Rocco Baldelli , Tampa Bay Devil Rays : Baldelli is coming back from both a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and reconstructive right elbow surgery . The Devil Rays gave him a long-term contract anyway , but much of it is incentive-laden after he sat out all of 2005 . " I just want to play a whole season and get my confidence back , " he told the St. Petersburg Times this month . <p> 5 Kerry Wood , Chicago Cubs : Starter ? Reliever ? Final year as a Cub ? We 'll find out as Wood bounces back from arthroscopic surgery on his right ( throwing ) shoulder . It 's a key year for him : the Cubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be missed <p> 1 Roger Clemens , Houston Astros : The Astros did n't offer arbitration in December . The 341-game winner is preparing for the World Baseball Classic and trying to determine whether he can make it through another season . Depending on how much they miss Clemens ( did the Lakers miss Shaq ? ) , the Astros could bring him back after May 1 . <p> 2 Bob Howry , Chicago Cubs : The right-hander was third in the American League with 29 holds for the Cleveland Indians , then signed a three-year , $12 million deal with the Cubs . That might be too rich for the Indians , but they also must replace righty David Riske ( to Boston ) and lefty Arthur Rhodes ( Philadelphia ) , who were traded . <p> 3 Bengie Molina , Toronto Blue Jays : The former Gold Glove catcher was the Los Angeles Angels ' best clutch hitter down the stretch last season but was set free to sign with the Blue Jays ( one year , $5.8 million ) . The Angels will try to replace him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford the offensive dropoff ? <p> 4 Aaron Rowand , Philadelphia Phillies : OK , so Rowand 's modest offensive contributions wo n't be missed by the White Sox , particularly if slugger Jim Thome is healthy . But Rowand brought defense and good chemistry to the Sox and epitomized their " Grinder " mentality . Remove that from a championship team , and it can be hard to recapture . <p> 5 Reggie Sanders , Kansas City Royals : The St. Louis Cardinals let him go to the Royals , taking with him leadership , attitude and ability to still get it done at 38 . Sanders is about to become the fifth member of the 300-300 club ( 292 homers , 297 stolen bases ) . In addition , his teams have reached the playoffs in five of the past six seasons . Five faces found new places <p> 1 Johnny Damon , New York Yankees : How drastically can one ( formerly ) shaggy-haired leadoff dynamo , late of Boston , swing the balance of power in the Most Chronicled Rivalry in Sports ? Better yet , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playoffs ? <p> 2 Kenji Johjima , Seattle Mariners : The Japanese import signed a three-year , $16.5 million deal . All he must do is learn to speak English and continue to average 30 home runs . <p> 3 Jim Leyland , Detroit Tigers : He 's managing for the first time since 1999 , when he suffered a Rocky Mountain low and retired after a 72-90 season with the Colorado Rockies . Leyland will have to prove he still has the touch that helped him lead teams to the playoffs four times in the 1990s . <p> 4 Kevin Millwood , Texas Rangers : Will the right-hander defy the odds and become a top-notch starter in the red-hot Arlington wind tunnel ? Or is he Exhibit B , behind Chan Ho Park , for why the Rangers generally avoid big free-agent pitching expenditures ? <p> 5 Billy Wagner , New York Mets : The Mets paid top dollar ( four years , $43 million ) for this top-flight closer . He must deliver , or he 'll be the one paying a steep price . Five changing positions <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where he started , moving from the outfield to third base . Oh , and he 'll also be counted on to carry the team 's offense . <p> 2 Adam Dunn , Cincinnati Reds : Because he walks so much ( 108 or more in 2002 , ' 04-05 ) , Dunn should know his way around his new position : first base . However , outfielders Austin Kearns , Ken Griffey and Wily Mo Pena are susceptible to injury ; Dunn should n't get too comfortable . <p> 3 Darin Erstad : Los Angeles Angels : Erstad won two Gold Gloves in the outfield before winning one at first base . Now he returns to center field . It will be an upset if he can make it through the spring without running into something or pulling a hamstring . <p> 4 Ryan Madson , Philadelphia Phillies : The right-hander has been a reliable middle reliever for two seasons , but now he joins a rotation looking for a true No. 1 . <p> 5 Alfonso Soriano , Washington Nationals : Soriano has never played left field and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose Vidro is healthy , the Nationals are expecting him to make the move . Sit back and watch Soriano butt heads with manager Frank Robinson . Five up and comers <p> 1 Josh Barfield , San Diego Padres : The son of former big leaguer Jesse Barfield will compete for the second base job with Mark Bellhorn and Bobby Hill . Barfield had 15 home runs and 20 stolen bases at Class AAA in 2005 . <p> 2 Jeremy Hermida , Florida Marlins : In a spring training full of questions for the Marlins , Hermida is a certainty after hitting .293 with four homers in 41 at-bats last season . The left fielder has been rated by Baseball America and other experts as one of the game 's top hitting prospects . <p> 3 Ian Kinsler , Texas Rangers : The rookie goes against veterans Mark DeRosa and D'Angelo Jimenez for the right to take over for Alfonso Soriano at second base . <p> 4 Casey Kotchman , Los Angeles Angels : He hit .302 with seven homers after getting called up in August and has the first base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angels . <p> 5 Chad Orvella , Tampa Bay Devil Rays : The right-hander will compete with a cast of thousands for the closer job . He had a 3.60 ERA in 50 innings last season . <p> PHOTO , B/W , Al Behrman , AP PHOTO , B/W , Mark Humphrey , AP PHOTO , B/W , AP PHOTO , B/W , John Rieger , US Presswire PHOTO , B/W , Chris Carlson , AP
