<p> WASHINGTON - Entangled in criminal investigations of political activities in Texas and Washington , U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay abandoned claims to his House majority leader 's post Saturday , a dramatic reversal for the former pest-control company owner who rose to the height of power in Congress . <p> DeLay reached the decision Saturday morning after consulting in the past two days with family and advisers , according to a spokesman , then announced his plans in separate letters to House Speaker Dennis Hastert and his GOP colleagues , and to supporters and reporters at Sugar Land City Hall . <p> " The job of majority leader and the mandate of the Republican majority are too important to be hamstrung , even for a few months , by personal distractions , " he wrote Hastert . <p> DeLay 's release of any hold on a House leadership role capped a tumultuous week in which GOP lawmakers increasingly voiced concerns that he has become an election-year liability because of ties to former lobbyist Jack Abramoff . As part of a plea bargain unveiled in federal court Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aides in the Washington corruption probe stemming from his representation of Indian tribes and other clients . <p> In Fort Bend County , DeLay told supporters he will continue to seek re-election this year in his suburban Houston district , where he faces competition in the March party primary and the November general election . <p> " I plan to run a vigorous campaign , and I plan to win it , " DeLay told the crowd . <p> In the letter to Republican lawmakers , DeLay proclaimed his innocence of any impropriety . <p> " During my time in Congress , I have always acted in an ethical manner within the rules of our body and the laws of our land . I am fully confident time will bear this out , " he said . <p> He has been scolded multiple times by the House ethics panel , however . <p> In Houston , civic and business leaders increasingly relied on DeLay to deliver federal funds and political favors for area projects and programs such as those at the Johnson Space Center . However , he tangled with city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using federal money for Metro 's rail projects . <p> Diminished ability <p> In a telephone interview with the Houston Chronicle , DeLay said Saturday that his absence from the leadership could diminish his ability to help the region . <p> " The majority leader controls what comes to the floor , and the Houston-Galveston area has benefited from that . That changes now , " he said . <p> Critics who " never gave me an even shake ought to think about that , " he remarked . <p> He said he would reclaim his seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee , where he first honed the legislative skills that brought him to the pinnacle of the House . <p> DeLay blamed Travis County prosecutor Ronnie Earle for forcing him to give up his post temporarily , saying the Democrat used legal maneuvers to postpone DeLay 's trial on campaign-finance violations . <p> " It became quite evident that Ronnie Earle was successful in delaying the process , " DeLay said . " The longer I was hanging out there , the more trouble he was causing . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with House rules , after a Travis County grand jury indicted him . Until Saturday , he sought a quick acquittal or dismissal of the charges on the way to reclaiming the top job . <p> DeLay told the Chronicle on Saturday that in recent days he discussed his situation with GOP leaders , including Hastert , and considered several options , including resigning from Congress . <p> In the end he decided against quitting Congress because " I still have a lot to contribute to the Houston-Galveston area , " he said . <p> His decision is expected to trigger a fierce succession battle for leadership , with several GOP lawmakers expected to challenge Rep. Roy Blunt , the Missouri Republican who replaced DeLay on a temporary basis . <p> Rep. John Boehner , R-Ohio , chairman of the House Education Committee , is expected to announce his candidacy for majority leader today . DeLay said he wo n't endorse anyone as a successor . <p> House Republican leaders , who as recently as last month refused to consider replacing DeLay permanently , praised his decision to step down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right decision for the House Republican Conference , " Hastert remarked . He said he expects to schedule the majority-leader election for the first week of February . <p> Other Republicans who were openly critical of DeLay in recent weeks expressed relief that they could install a new leader unshaded by an ethical cloud . <p> I look forward to the democratic process of choosing a new majority leader who will ensure that integrity , honesty and ethical accountability are central tenets of government operations in Washington , " Rep. Charlie Bass , R-N.H. , said . <p> GOP petition drive <p> Bass , along with Rep. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , spearheaded a petition drive among Republican lawmakers late last week to force a new leadership election . <p> DeLay dismissed the significance of the criticism within the GOP , saying it reflected the views of only 20 or 30 members . <p> " I enjoyed incredibly strong support , " he said . <p> In recent statements , President Bush defended DeLay , who has been a crucial ally in pushing the White House legislative agenda . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We respect Congressman DeLay 's decision to put the interests of the American people , the House of Representatives and the Republican Party first , " Bush spokeswoman Erin Healy said . <p> For Democrats , DeLay 's absence from the leadership is a double-edged sword . His skill at rounding up congressional votes frequently deprived the minority party of legislative successes , but Democrats also had made him their poster child for an emerging campaign theme attacking a " culture of corruption " in the GOP-run Congress . <p> " The culture of corruption is so pervasive in the Republican conference that a single person stepping down is not nearly enough to clean up the Republican Congress , " House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said Saturday . <p> DeLay 's Texas criminal case probably will remain pending by the time Congress resumes business at the end of the month . But for many lawmakers , the turning point for DeLay 's fate as a leader came when the Justice Department announced the plea agreement with Abramoff . <p> He is expected to provide incriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in his lobbying schemes . <p> DeLay , never mentioned as a target of the investigation before the lobbyist admitted guilt , has been closely associated with Abramoff for more than a decade . The lawmaker took three foreign trips with the lobbyist , who used his clients ' funds to defray a sizable portion of the costs in a way that DeLay has said was legal . <p> Former DeLay staffers figure prominently in the investigation . For instance , Michael Scanlon , his former spokesman , worked with Abramoff , agreed to a plea deal in November and is cooperating with investigators . DeLay 's former deputy chief of staff , Tony Rudy , is referred to as " Staffer A " in the Abramoff case and reportedly is cooperating with authorities . <p> DeLay 's support among Republicans at home will remain strong , said Jared Woodfill , chairman of the Harris County Republican Party . <p> Ultimately , it is not good for him to be outside of the leadership , " Woodfill said , but politically , I think he will be just fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will send him back to D.C. " <p> However , recent polls show that DeLay is likely to face a bruising and expensive re-election battle in a redrawn district that includes many voters who are relatively unfamiliar with him . <p> He faces a well-financed Democratic opponent , Nick Lampson , who lost his Beaumont-area congressional seat in 2004 as a result of DeLay 's redistricting scheme . Former Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood has signed up for the November ballot as an independent candidate for DeLay 's job . <p> ... <p> WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER DOES <p> The majority leader is second to the speaker in the party hierarchy and is not in the order of presidential succession . Chosen by the majority party 's conference in organizational meetings prior to the start of a new Congress , the majority leader 's role has largely been defined by history and tradition . <p> Working closely with the speaker and the party 's whips , the majority leader is charged with scheduling legislation for floor consideration . The majority leader helps plan daily , weekly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on issues ; urges colleagues to support or defeat measures on the floor ; and , in general , works to advance the goals of the majority party . <p> The majority leader is also responsible for closely watching floor activities , especially the opposition party 's parliamentary maneuvers , but by custom does not typically lead floor debate on major measures . <p> Source : Congressional Research Service <p> NOTES : Chronicle reporter Eric Hanson contributed to this report from Sugar Land . bennett.roth@chron.com **25;7028;TOOLONG JESSICA KOURKOUNIS : FOR THE CHRONICLE @x No MOMENTS OF life 's span draw us to look for God 's presence more than birth and death do . And poetry , one of our vehicles for stretching our gaze toward the divine , often focuses on these beginning and ending points of the human earthly journey . The example I write about here is Kate Daniels 's poem " Inscrutable , " which takes as its subject life 's starting point , entering into a mother 's experience of childbirth . Kate Daniels is a poet , mother and literature professor at Vanderbilt University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often shocking ways of pulling us into his life . The book 's presiding spirit is Simone Weil , the mid-20th-century French philosopher and mystic . Weil challenged the very notion of " searching " for God . It is God who searches for us , she insisted . All we can do is look toward God with the most intense longing , while abandoning the desire for anything except God 's love . No " muscular effort " will get us to God , Weil writes in Waiungfar God ( 1973 ) , but " only waiting , attention , silence , immobility , constant through suffering and joy . " Four Testimonies gives us a range of characters who wait for God with the utmost attention , some through extremities of suffering that would seem beyond endurance . There are extremities of joy as well in these poems , particularly in the section called " Portrait of the Artist as Mother , " from which " Inscrutable " is taken . But whether the people in Daniels 's poems experience suffering or joy or a blend of both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as Simone Weil is the theologian of radical acceptance , Kate Daniels is its poet . Could there be a poem with more bodiliness than this one ? Look first at this poem just as a visual shape on the page . See how long and skinny it is ? How it starts at the top with a thin bit of text , poking its way out like a newborn baby 's head , then toward the bottom suddenly bursts its right margin into questions : " Why God ? Why love ? Why ... ? " Questions , yes . But they are all one question : why ? Ten times the poem wails out the primal question " why ? " It is the question with which young children notoriously bombard their parents , is n't it ? In fact , the poem looks on the page like the squirming squiggly body of a question . But back to the beginning of this breathtaking , intensely gripping poem . It begins in utter concreteness : " The face seen . " For 1 1 lines , Daniels scrutinizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gobbling up with her language every detail of this wondrous new creature . And then suddenly the wonder itself overwhelms her : the minutely observed details burst open with a gasp at " just the goddamn mystery/of it all . " And here is where the whys begin . At first they are whys about the mystery of this particular new human life : " why there is/ anything , anything at all/ rather than nothing emerging/ from the bloody hole/ in my opened body . " Then in the very same breath , the same grammatical flow ( for there has been no period in the poem yet ) , the mystery of this moment of her child 's birth zooms out into the " eons " over which she and this very child seem to have been connected . The " call to claim it " then overflows , still in the same grammatical onrush , into the astonishing image of sexual longing , so that the sexual desire that led to the conception of this child enfolds the mother 's relation to the child itself . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commas keep spiraling us onward and outward , we are tumbled from this sexual longing right into God : " . . . longing , why God leaning over .... " To call this image startling is a euphemism . The link of the " l " - words makes of God a lover , leaning over his creation in - yes - sexual desire . And now we must pause , even though the poem does not Look at where the tumbling out of mystery upon mystery has taken us . From the just-born baby 's face we have come to God " splitting Himself to become/ the first creature " ( Adam ? Jesus ? both ? ) and remaining " in love with the world/ for the rest of eternity . " The awesome mystery of childbirth and the awesome mystery of God 's creation are merged . Both are the mystery of love . But God in love ? What might that mean ? The poem surges onward in quest of a way to picture it . Where we land is with God " alone no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her astounding theological vision . In that single Une , a God who had been " alone " and " inviolate " is so no longer - because he has given himself over to love 's desire . Like a woman in sexual embrace , he has opened himself to being " violated " by love . No wonder the poem skips a beat after the word " inviolate . " We need a breath to absorb the implications of this image of God 's creative act . So the next Une takes a deep gulp of space before coming out with the finality of " no more . " And to stop the poem further in its tracks , here is its first and only period . Not that the 29 preceding lines have formed a grammatically viable sentence . They have been a spiraling of subject clauses - first the noun clauses scrutinizing the newborn ( " the face ... , the hair ... , the mathematical perfection ... , the primirive muscles ... " ) , then the " why " clauses scrutinizing the mystery of creation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like this face ... , why God leaning over ... , why splitting Himself ... , why in love with the world ... " ) - but nary a verb to make the sentence complete . The effect is to leave us hanging with the unaccountable wonder of it all . The mystery of creation is not meant to be solved ; the poem is clear about that The mystery - as Kate Daniels 's " Inscrutable " engages it - moves us to fragments of intense observation and to questions whose tone is an impassioned search . But this is an impassioned search that embraces as well an acceptance of never arriving at the answer . The poem 's final lines condense this experience of the whole . They are a concatenation of whys- " Why God ? Why love ? Why/ this infant sucking me and why/ me ... " - that bring the poem back to the very concrete newborn baby , whose birth got the poem going , at the same time as they swirl out to embrace the mother/poet herself . Her absolute acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery of creation is the poem 's closing attitude . Yet her acceptance itself is a question , a why . People often say of a baby 's face that it is " inscrutable . " They also say it of the divine , of God 's " inscrutable " ways . Daniels takes this term for her tide and plunges headlong into a probing of inscrutability itself . She probes by scrutinizing the inscrutable with the tireless interrogating force of poetic attention . And where does this onrush of eager interrogation get her ? To an equally inscrutable " weeping with gratitude " that she , her newborn and God himself are " exactly this way , " though why they are will forever be left hanging . As epigraph for the section of Four Testimonies in which " Inscrutable " appears , Daniels chose a passage from Simone Weil 's essay " The Love of God and Affliction " : When an apprentice gets hurt , or complains of being tired , the workmen and peasants have this fine expression : " It is the trade entering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through , we can say to ourselves quite truly that it is the universe , the order and beauty of the world and the obethence of creation to God that are entering our body . After that how can we fail to bless with tenderest gratitude the Love that sends us this gift ? Meeting God 's Love at the core of our bodily life : this is Weil 's vision that Daniels ( yes ) embodies in her poem .
