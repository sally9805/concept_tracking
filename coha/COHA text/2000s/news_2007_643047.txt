<p> When economics students returned this winter to the elite Ecole Normale Superieure here , copies of a simple one-page petition were posted in the corridors demanding an unlikely privilege : French as a teaching language . <p> " We understand that economics is a discipline , like most scientific fields , where the research is published in English , " the petition read , in apologetic tones . But it declared that it was unacceptable for a native French professor to teach standard courses to French-speaking students in the adopted tongue of English . <p> In the shifting universe of global academia , English is becoming as commonplace as creeping ivy and mortarboards . In the last five years , the world 's top business schools and universities have been pushing to make English the teaching tongue in a calculated strategy to raise revenues by attracting more international students and as a way to respond to globalization . <p> Business universities are driving the trend , partly because changes in international accreditation standards in the late 1990s required them to include English-language components . But English is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean universities offering up to 30 percent of their courses in the language . The former president of Korea University in Seoul sought to raise that share to 60 percent , but ultimately was not re-elected to his post in December . <p> In Madrid , business students can take their admissions test in English for the elite Instituto de Empresa and enroll in core courses for a master 's degree in business administration in the same language . The Lille School of Management in France stopped considering English a foreign language in 1999 , and now half the postgraduate programs are taught in English to accommodate a rising number of international students . <p> Over the last three years , the number of masters programs offered in English at universities with another host language has more than doubled , to 3,300 programs at 1,700 universities , according to David A. Wilson , chief executive of the Graduate Management Admission Council , an international organization of leading business schools that is based in McLean , Va . <p> " We are shifting to English . Why ? " said Laurent Bibard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top French business school in a suburb of Paris that is a fertile breeding ground for chief executives . <p> " It 's the language for international teaching , " he said . " English allows students to be able to come from anyplace in the world and for our students  --  the French ones  --  to go everywhere . " <p> This year the university is fluidly celebrating its 100th anniversary in its adopted tongue . Its new publicity film debuted in English and French . Along one of the main roads leading into Paris loomed a giant blue billboard boasting of the anniversary in French and , in smaller letters , in English . <p> Essec has also taken advantage of the increased revenue that foreign students  --  English-speaking ones  --  can bring in . Its population of foreign students has leapt by 38 percent in four years , to 909 today out of a student body of 3,700 . <p> The tuition for a two-year master 's degree in business administration is 19,800 euros for European Union citizens , and 34,000 euros for non-EU citizens . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Christophe N. Bredillet , the associate dean for the Lille School of Management 's M.B.A . and postgraduate programs . " Revenue is very important , and in order to provide good services , we need to cover our expenses for the library and research journals . We need to cover all these things with a bigger number of students so it 's quite important to attract international students . " <p> With the jump in foreign students , Essec now offers 25 percent of its 200 courses in English . Its ambition is to accelerate the English offerings to 50 percent in the next three years . <p> Santiago Iniguez de Ozono , dean of the Instituto de Empresa , argues that the trend is a natural consequence of globalization , with English functioning as Latin did in the 13th century as the lingua franca most used by universities . <p> " English is being adapted as a working language , but it 's not Oxford English , " he said . " It 's a language that most stakeholders speak . " He carries out conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But getting students to feel comfortable speaking English in the classroom is easier said than done . When younger French students at Essec start a required course in organizational analysis , the atmosphere is marked by long , uncomfortable silences , said Alan Jenkins , a management professor and academic director of the executive M.B.A . program . <p> " They are very good on written tasks , but there 's a lot of reticence on oral communication and talking with the teacher , " Dr. Jenkins said , adding that he used role-playing to encourage students to speak . He also refuses to speak in French . " I have to force myself to say , ' Can you give me that in English ? ' " <p> Officials at Ewha Womans University in Seoul are also aware that they face a difficult task at the first stage of their Global 2010 project , which will require new students to take four classes in English , two under the tutelage of native English-speaking professors . The 120-year-old university has embarked on a hiring spree to attract 50 foreign professors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have less efficiency or effectiveness in terms of knowledge transfer than those courses taught in Korean , " said Anna Suh , program manager for the university 's office of global affairs , who said that students eventually see the benefits . " Our aim for this kind of program is to prepare and equip our students to be global leaders in this new era of internationalization . " <p> The Lille management school is planning to open a satellite business school program next fall in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates , where the working language will also be in English . <p> " Internationally , the competition is everywhere , " Dr. Bredillet said . " For a masters in management , I 'm competing with George Washington University . I 'm competing with some programs in Germany , Norway and the U.K. That 's why we 're delivering the curriculum in English . " ##
