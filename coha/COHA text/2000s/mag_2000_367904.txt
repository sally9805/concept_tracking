Six years ago , Audrey Kishline wrote the book on Moderation Management . Moderate Drinking : The New Option for Problem Drinkers set guidelines so that people with alcohol problems could continue drinking  --  as long as they were careful . <P> Kishline was n't . Last March , two months after she left the program she founded saying that it was n't working for her , she drove the wrong way on a Washington State highway and smashed her pickup truck into a two-door Dodge , killing a man and his 12-year-old daughter . State troopers found Kishline unconscious , with a half-empty bottle of vodka by her side . Her blood-alcohol level was 0.26 , more than three times the legal limit . <P> Kishline 's devastating meltdown has reignited debate , and outrage , over an already controversial treatment approach . Moderation Management , which has volunteer chapters in 14 states , allows a weekly quota of nine drinks for women and 14 for men . Designed for mild-to-moderate problem drinkers , the program consists of meetings similar to those of Alcoholics Anonymous , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a journal documenting their drinking and to limit and pace their intake of alcohol . Understandably , and perhaps wisely , since she faces sentencing next month for vehicular homicide , Kishline is now a sharp critic of the movement , dismissing it through her lawyer as a " program for alcoholics covering up their own alcoholism . " <P> She has plenty of company . The Smithers Addiction Treatment and Research Center in New York City , renowned for its attempts to treat the likes of Truman Capote and , more recently , Darryl Strawberry , edged out its director after he spoke out in favor of managed moderation . Center officials issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to abstinence as the only viable treatment . <P> " There is n't an alcoholic around who does n't wish he could drink moderately , " says Dr. Ernest Noble , director of UCLA 's Alcohol Research Center . He adds that similar attempts at moderation , such as Controlled Drinking , Drink Watchers and Rational Recovery , have a long history of failure . Dr. Nicholas Pace , co-founder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments are doomed because alcoholism , as abstinence advocates have drummed into the public 's consciousness , is a disease . People who drink heavily over a long period of time permanently alter their livers , which means that they can no longer metabolize alcohol normally in the event that they do resume drinking . " The disease is progressive , " says Pace . " If you put people on an island and give them alcohol every day , they will become alcoholics . " <P> Proponents of moderation counter that not all problem drinkers are alcoholics , and that the abstinence-only crowd makes the mistake of lumping everyone into the same category . Marc Kern , director of the Los Angeles-based Addiction Alternatives , accuses " A.A. nudniks of acting like fundamentalists " in their insistence on abstinence . He believes their all-or-nothing approach can backfire and turn off problem drinkers who may need a less drastic form of help . " It 's not a black-and-white issue , " says Kern .                 @ @ @ @
