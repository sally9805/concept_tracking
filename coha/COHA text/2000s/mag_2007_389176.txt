So we called him to find out why . F &S:; So , best overall , best come-from-behind , best on TV . Also tied for classiest . Why ? KVD : I do n't know , maybe because I win too often ? Listen , that was a joke . Do n't print that . Really . F &S:; Okay . You have my word as a journalist . KVD : Seriously , the biggest thing is to win , obviously . But if you can do it at the top level and earn the respect of the guys you compete against , that 's as good as it gets . The winner ought to be the guy who 's best at finding his own fish , adjusting to conditions , and executing . And that 's not always the guy who wins the tournament . F &S:; How so ?

In the ' ' 90s , I had Slug-Gos in a bag on my boat for a year before I tied one on . It just did n't look like it would work , you know ? How could that thing have any action at all ?

No ... 71% Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed picked green pumpkin as their favorite color in soft-plastic baits . What makes it so popular and effective ? " Green pumpkin , a matte or dirty green color with black flakes , mimics a live crayfish , " says Tom Carroll of Yum Lures . " It 's been around for 20 years but continues to catch bass because it 's so subtle . It 's especially deadly in a bottom-bumping body configuration , such as a Texas-rigged creature or a finesse worm on a jighead . " Chris Brown of Strike King Lures agrees . " Without question , it 's our most popular soft-bait color , " he says . " Just as bass eat crayfish regardless of the color of the water they 're in , they 'll hit a green pumpkin lure whether the lake or river is clear , stained , or muddy . Because it 's so unobtrusive , bass bite it in the toughest conditions , such as during cold fronts , and when they 've been subjected to intense fishing pressure during tournaments . " THE TOUR 'S HOTTEST LURE So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shaking , a " shaky-head worm "  --  a finesse worm rigged on a jighead  --  was voted the lure that catches the most bass . To fish it , rig a 4- to 6-inch straight-tail finesse worm on a 1/8 to - ounce jighead , either weedless or with the hook point exposed depending on bottom conditions . The Bagley Shaky Head Jig ( above , rigged with a pumpkin worm ) is a great choice ; it has a flat forward section so the hook rides high , and a collar on the hook shaft keeps the worm from slipping off after repeated casts . Cast the worm to submerged brushpiles , weed edges , and boat docks , and let it sink to the bottom . Then raise the rod to one o'clock and very gently move the tip up and down . Do n't overdo it . The idea is to impart a quivering action to the worm while it 's sitting in one spot . Hop the worm a few inches , then shake it again . III .

Yes ... 98% No ... 2 GOING THE DISTANCE More than half of the pros surveyed have driven their boats 100 miles or more one way in a tournament to reach a preferred fishing spot . Why bother ? " You need to go where the bass are , " explains Tennessee pro Charlie Ingram . " In one tournament on the Mississippi River , most of the top finishers ran 130 miles to get to a series of oxbow lakes that had been inaccessible until rains preceding the event raised the water level . They were crawling with bass . " Alabama pro Russ Lane says , " Sometimes you need to get away so you can focus on fishing . At a tournament at Kentucky Lake , we launched at the dam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pickwick Dam in the southwest corner of Tennessee . I did n't see a tournament boat in three days , and I had a good finish . " LOVE YOUR LARGEMOUTH More than two-thirds of pros admit to having kissed a fish . Although the average fisherman may find the practice unappealing , you might pucker up too if the 6-pound largemouth you 're holding could net you a half-million-dollar payout . If any professional angler can tell you the best way to lip-lock a lunker , it 's Jimmy Houston . The bass pro and TV host has been bussing bass in public for 30 years . Here 's his four-step approach . 1 Unhook the bass . This is very important . 2 Put your thumb in its mouth with your other hand supporting its belly . " Make sure you 're kissing the correct ( head ) end of the bass , " says Houston . 3 Make eye contact . Then aim for the top lip . Do n't phantom kiss . Go for it ! 4 Release the fish afterward . It 's the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never kiss and kill .
