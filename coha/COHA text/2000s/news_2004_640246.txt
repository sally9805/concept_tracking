<p> EAGLE - Her daughter has been stalked by the public , harassed by the media and forced to move from state to state . <p> So on Thursday , the mother of Kobe Bryant 's accuser asked a judge to hurry up and set a trial date in hopes of minimizing the threats and shadowing her daughter has endured since the 19-year- <p> old said she was sexually assaulted by the basketball star . <p> ' The defense begins to question everyone she meets . The media reveals her location , ' the woman wrote in a letter to District Judge Terry Ruckriegle . ' Her safety is at risk , and she has to move again . She ca n't live at home . She ca n't live with relatives . She ca n't go to school or talk to her friends . <p> ' When she moves to a new location she does n't know anyone .

' <p> In an unusual legal request , the 19-year-old 's attorney , John Clune , complained Thursday that the case had endured more than three months of motions hearings , yet Bryant has n't been asked to enter a plea , and no trial date has been set - all while his client has been harassed and stalked continually . <p> The woman , according to a letter from her mother that was attached to the legal filing by Clune , ' has lived in four different states in the past six months . ' <p> ' She is followed everywhere by the defense and the media , ' the letter states . <p> Just Wednesday , hours after the accuser 's first appearance in court in a closed-door hearing , the woman and some friends were at a restaurant when they were accosted by a man with a camera who would not leave them alone until the accuser pulled out a cellphone to call for help , Clune said . <p> The woman , a former front-desk employee at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his room June 30 .

Ruckriegle is not expected to rule on the issue for at least several weeks . <p> The judge also has scheduled additional hearings on motions well into May before Bryant is expected to enter a plea , a move that would invoke speedy-trial provisions requiring a trial within six months . <p> Bryant has not waived his right to a speedy trial , but his attorneys and prosecutors have agreed to follow the judge 's plan to resolve motions before accepting a plea . <p> ' Kobe Bryant could have forced the issue at any point . He could have stood up before Judge Ruckriegle and entered a not-guilty plea and said , ' I want a trial within six months , " said former Denver prosecutor Craig Silverman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadows the needs of alleged victims in sexual-assault cases , said Cynthia Stone , spokeswoman for the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault . <p> ' This woman 's universe is the nation .

' Even the defendant is able to continue living in his home and continue his employment .

The judge does . ' <p> Arguing over just such an issue Thursday afternoon , an Eagle County sheriff 's detective , Daniel Loya , took the stand in a portion of the hearing devoted to determining whether statements Bryant made to investigators are admissible . <p> The defense team of Hal Haddon and Pamela Mackey claims Bryant was tricked into giving statements to investigators late July 1 and then was improperly taken to a Glenwood Springs hospital for hair , blood and saliva samples . <p> Loya , the investigator who surreptitiously recorded Bryant 's comments that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing on whether to suppress the evidence against Bryant was not completed and will be continued next Friday .  --  Letter from accuser 's mother <p> March 24 , 2004 <p> Your Honor , <p> I would like to share with you the reality of my daughter 's life . <p> You are aware of three people that have been arrested for threatening her life .

Last night , she tried to have dinner with a friend and her friend 's mom . On the way into the restaurant , a man came up to them , pulled out a camera and began taking pictures and questioning them . They asked him to stop . They tried to walk away . He followed them and would not stop until she used a cell phone to call for help . First there is the fear when someone walks up to her and pulls something out of their pocket .
