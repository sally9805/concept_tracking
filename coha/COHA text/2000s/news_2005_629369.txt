<p> A building that was once part of the campus of the first black school in Houston was demolished on Oct. 24 . <p> The building 's demolition has been met with two differing opinions : Either it was the first step toward renovating the historic Gregory School in the Freedmen 's Town neighborhood of the Fourth Ward into a black African-American archival and cultural center , or it was another nail in the coffin of the history of what was once a thriving black community . <p> The city of Houston tore down the one-story auxiliary building at the northeast corner of the campus of Gregory Elementary School , 1300 Victor , as part of a $6 million project to renovate the school , which was built in 1926 but has been vacant for 25 years . <p> In April 2003 , the city purchased the 20,000-square-foot Gregory School property from the Houston Independent School District for $1 . <p> Later that year , Fourth Ward residents and city officials decided to turn the vacant facility into the African-American Archive and Cultural Center . <p> City officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolition of the one-story building , built in 1962 , that served as a cafeteria for Gregory . But community leaders in Freedmen 's Town now claim the city is going back on its word after saying that it wanted to preserve the heritage of the black community in the Fourth Ward through the project . <p> " The entire school is part of the African-American legacy of both this city and country , " said Lenwood Johnson , a Fourth Ward community activist and member of the Free Man 's Neighborhood Association . " It was the first African-American , general public school funded by the community . <p> " We did n't want any of that taken away . The community overwhelmingly wanted to retain the entire site and the city came in and did what they wanted to do . " <p> Issa Dadoush , director of the city 's Building Services Department , said there was no way to salvage the cafeteria building and by tearing it down the city will , in the long run , be creating a better environment for the cultural center that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There was never a plan to keep that one-story building up , " Dadoush said . " The roofing had collapsed . I 've had engineers go in there and they 've all said that the building is unsafe . We have never said that we were going to keep that building . " <p> Dadoush said that at five community meetings held to determine how to renovate the Gregory School , the city told residents that its plans included tearing down the two side structures near the school . <p> While the main , 1926 Gregory School building has been designated as a state archaeological landmark by the Texas Historical Commission , the side buildings were not designated landmarks and , as a result , could be torn down . <p> No authority <p> Debbi Head , public relations coordinator for the historical commission , confirmed the claim , saying it did not have the authority to stop the demolition of the cafeteria . <p> In August , Houston 's City Council created a new category of landmark , " protected landmarks , " and gave eight buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gregory School . <p> But , as with the Texas Historical Commission , only the main building received that designation . <p> Tim O'Brien , a Freedmen 's Town resident , said that while the community did not have the authority to stop the demolition , tearing the building down was symbolic of a process where the city has ignored community wishes for the property . <p> " We were led to believe that it was an unimportant building , " O'Brien said . " But in conversations with the Texas Historical Commission , they did n't give the final approval on the plans that involved tearing that building down . <p> " We have n't been allowed to respond to the plans , " he added . " Basically , we 've been kept in the dark . We 've been shut out of the process . " <p> Public meetings <p> Dadoush said the city has compromised its plans to please the community . <p> He said that at the public meetings , project planners scrapped their plans to tear down the two-story building adjacent to the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school was going to be destroyed . <p> " When you say you have to tear down a building , some people are going to be angry , " he said . " I completely understand that . But this is an important first step . " <p> Catherine Roberts , co-founder of the Rutherford B.H. Yates Museum in Freedmen 's Town , said that when rumblings initially began about restoring the Gregory School property , some in the community had grander plans for the campus , including affordable housing and a public park . <p> She said when those plans did n't come to fruition , feelings were hurt . <p> " When they were doing the planning in 2002 , some people wanted nothing removed , " Roberts said . " They felt the buildings were sound , and they wanted a totally different use for them , and they 've never backed away from that plan . " <p> In retrospect , Johnson said he wishes the community had been able to fight harder against the demolition of the cafeteria building , but its hands were tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic designation by the state ( in 1985 ) , that building was n't old enough , " Johnson said of a rule that allowed only buildings 50 years or older to be historically designated . " And there had to be unusual circumstances , like special styles of architecture , to make exceptions . This building did n't have that . <p> " We could have made louder arguments to protect the building , but we did n't have the resources , " he added . " We could spend $40,000 to get a court injunction , but we do n't have that . And for the little people who do n't have the resources , they get bulldozed by the people in power . The only thing we have left is political pressure . " <p> O'Brien said community members asked City Council members Ada Edwards and Carol Alvarado to stop the demolition of the cafeteria building , but got no response . <p> " We found out about ( the building teardown ) Friday ( Oct. 21 ) , and we started making calls , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've tried to hold people 's feet to the fire , but in the end they do n't stick up for their community . " <p> Edwards ' response <p> " That ( cafeteria ) building , we just did n't have enough money to reconstruct , " said Ada Edwards , District D councilwoman . <p> " I 'm not sure what they want us to do . If we leave it up , it 's an eyesore , but if we take it down , we 're the bad guys . <p> " The issue has been to get the main historical building refurbished , and we 're working toward that . But we could n't refurbish that other building . It was too far gone . " <p> O'Brien also said the city has left the buildings unsecured for months , despite the fact that another nearby historical landmark , the Bethel Baptist Church , fell victim to arson . <p> " They 've been leaving the property unsecured and basically inviting people to burn it down , " O'Brien said . " They say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that finally got it boarded up . Then they said the ( cafeteria ) building was unsafe , and they used that as an excuse to tear it down . " <p> Museum project <p> Dadoush said the city plans to turn the land where the demolished building stood into a parking area for the museum and additional greenspace . <p> He said the project , which was designed by black architect James S. Walker , is getting close to the start of construction , with the estimated date for completion being sometime next year . <p> The project is bounded by Victor , Wilson , Cleveland and Cushing streets . <p> " We 've received the construction documents , " he said . " We 've finished the design and development phase . We 're at a late stage in planning now , where once we put our comments on the construction documents and submit them to the Texas Historical Commission for approval , we can go advertise for bids , then go before City Council for final approval . " <p> But Johnson and O'Brien say the community remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction date is quickly approaching . <p> " They 're already planning to change the character of the original building , which the community said they did n't want , " Johnson said . " They 're turning the front area into the back , and the back into the front . I do n't think they really respect how much the community wants to see this restored to its original form . <p> " And we 've tried to put pressure on our political leaders , our black community leaders , but they have n't responded . " <p> Said Dadoush , " We will protect that 1926 building at all costs . <p> " We 'll make it better and we 'll make it something to be proud of . But that 1962 building was never found to have any historical significance . "
