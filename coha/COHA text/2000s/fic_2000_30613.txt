Chapter One Lake Henry , New Hampshire Like everything else at the lake , dawn arrived in its own good time . The flat black of night slowly deepened to a midnight blue that lightened in lazy steps , gradually giving form to the spike of a tree , the eave of a cottage , the tongue of a weathered wood dock  --  and that was on a clear day . On this day , fog slowed the process of delineation , reducing the lake to a pool of milky glass and the shoreline to a hazy wash of orange , gold , and green where , normally , vibrant fall colors would be . A glimpse of cranberry or navy marked a lakefront home , but details were lost in the mist . Likewise the separation of reflection and shore . The effect , with the air quiet and still , was that of a protective cocoon . It was a special moment . The only thing John Kipling would change about it was the cold . He was n't ready for summer to end , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been two months before . The sun set sooner and rose later , and the chill of the night lingered . He felt it . His loons felt it . The foursome he watched , two adults and their young , would remain on the lake for another five weeks , but they were growing restless , looking to the sky lately in ways that had less to do with predators than with thoughts of migration . As he watched now , they floated in the fog not twenty feet from his canoe , not ten feet again from the tiny fircovered island in whose sheltered cove they had summered . The island was one of many that dotted Lake Henry . Between the clarity of the water , the quiet of the lake , and the abundance of small fish , those islands lured the loons back yearafter year  --  because they did n't do well on land . Their feet were set too far back under large , cumbersome bodies . So they built nests on the very edge of these islands , where they could more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful watching them lurch even those precious few inches from water to nest . In all other respects , though , the loons were a sight to behold . Since the chicks ' birth , in July , he had watched their plumage go from baby black to toddler brown to a rather drab juvenile gray , but they had their parents ' tapered beaks and sleek necks , and a promise of future brilliance  --  and those parents , ahhhh , those parents were brilliant indeed , even in fall , with their plumage starting to dull , even this morning , through the veil of an ashy mist . They were beauties , with crisp checkerboards of white-on-black backs , white-stripe necklaces around black necks , solid black heads , distinctive pointed beaks . As if that were n't impressive enough , they had riveting round red eyes . John had heard that the red enhanced underwater vision , and he could believe it . Those eyes did n't miss much . The birds lay low in the water now , swimming gently around the cove , alternately rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troll for fish . When one of the adults compressed its body and dove , a webbed power propelled it deep . John knew it might fill its belly with up to fifteen minnows before resurfacing a distance away . He searched the fog until he spotted it again . Its mate continued to float near the island , but both adults were alert , those pointed bills tipped just a little higher as they scoured the fog for news . Later that morning they would leave their young , run laboriously across the surface of the lake , and lumber up into the air . After circling a time or two until they gained altitude enough to clear the trees , they would fly to a neighboring lake to visit other loons . Breeding was a solitary time , and with two fledglings to show for months of vigilance and work , this pair had done well . Now they had to refresh their social skills in preparation for wintering in larger groups on the warmer Atlantic coast . For an eon , loons had repeated this ritual . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the current crop of birds that September was halfway done , October would bring colder days and evening frost , and November would bring ice . Since they needed an expanse of clear water for takeoff , they had to leave the lake before it froze . And they would . In all his years growing up on the lake , then returning as an adult to watch again , John had n't seen many icebound loons . Their instincts were good . They rarely erred . John , however , erred  --  and often . Had n't he done it again this morning , setting out in a T-shirt and shorts , wanting it to be summer still and finding himself butt cold now ? He sometimes had trouble accepting that he was n't twenty anymore . He was over forty  --  and , yes , still six three and fit , but his body did n't work the way it once did . It ached around the knees , wrinkled around the eyes , receded at the temples , and chilled in the extremities . But cold or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There might not necessarily be the makings of a big best-seller in it , but he had n't had his fill of the loons . He sat rock still in the canoe with his hands in his armpits for warmth and his paddle stowed . These loons were used to his presence , but he took nothing for granted . As long as he kept his distance and respected their space , they would reward him with preening and singing . When the world was eerily quiet  --  at night , at dawn , on mornings like this when the fog muffled other noise that life on the lake might make  --  the loons ' song shimmered and rose . And it came now  --  breathtaking  --  a primitive tremolo released with the shiver of a jaw , so beautiful , so mysterious , so wild that it raised the hair on the back of his neck . It also carried a message . The tremolo was a cry of alarm . Granted , this one was low in pitch , which made it only a warning , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood on fiberglass , he lifted his paddle . Water lapped softly against the canoe as he guided it backward . When he was ten more feet away , he stabilized his position and quietly restowed the paddle . Hugging his elbows to his thighs for warmth , he sat , watched , listened , waited . In time , the loon closest to him stretched his neck forward and issued a long , low wail . The sound was n't unlike the cry of a coyote , but John would never confuse the two . The loon 's wail was at the same time more elemental and more delicate . This one was the start of a dialogue , one adult calling the other in a succession of haunting sounds that brought the distant bird gliding closer . Even when they were ten feet apart , they continued to speak , with their beaks nearly shut and their elongated throats swelling around the sound . Goose bumps rose on his skin . This was why he had returned to the lake  --  why , after swearing off New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some said he 'd done it for the job , others that he 'd done it for his father , but the roundabout truth had to do with these birds . They signified something primal and wild , but simple , straightforward , and safe . A loon 's fife consisted of eating , grooming , and procreating . It was an honest life , devoid of pretense , ambition , and cruelty . The loon harmed others only when its own existence was threatened . John found that totally refreshing . So he stayed longer , though he knew he should leave . It was Monday . Lake News had to be at the printer by noon on Wednesday . He already had material from his staff correspondents , one per town . Assuming that the appropriate bins held articles promised by local movers and shakers  --  " movers and shakers " being a relative term  --  he would have a wad of reading and editing , keystroking , cutting and pasting . If those articles were n't in the bins , he would call around Lake Henry and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone , and write what he could himself  --  and if he still ended up with dead space , he would run more Thoreau . There was n't a book in that either , he told himself . A book had to be original . He had notebooks filled with ideas , folders thick with anecdotes he had collected since returning to town , but nothing sparked an urge to hustle  --  at least , not when it came to writing a book . He did hustle when it came to Lake News  --  but mostly between noon Tuesdays and noon Wednesdays . He was a last-minute kind of guy . He wrote better under the threat of a deadline closing in , liked the rush of a newsroom filled with action and noise , liked the perversion of keeping the managing editor on edge . Of course , he was the managing editor now . And the production editor . And the photography editor , the society editor , the layout editor . Lake News was n't the Boston Post . Not by a long shot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was n't one . His paddle remained stowed , and the loons continued to call . Then came a pause , and John dared mimic the sound . One of the loons said something in return , and in that brief , heady instant , he felt part of the team . In the next instant , with a resumption of the birds ' duet , he was excluded again , a species apart . But not cold . He realized he was no longer cold . The fog was burning off under a brightening sun . By the time patches of blue showed through the mist , John guessed it was nearly nine . He straightened his legs and , easing back , braced his elbows on the gunwales . Turning his face to the sun , he closed his eyes , took a contented breath , and listened to silence , water , and loon . After a time , when the sun began to heat his eyelids and the weight of responsibility grew too heavy to ignore , he pushed himself up . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these birds gave him . Then smoothly and silently , if reluctantly , he retrieved his paddle from the floorboards and headed home . The beauty of a beard was that it eliminated the need to shave . John kept his cropped close , which meant occasional touch-ups , but none of the daily scrape-and-bleed agony that he used to endure . Same thing with a necktie . No need for one here . Or for a pressed shirt . Or for anything but denim down below . He did n't even have to worry about matching socks , since it was either bare feet and Birks in summer or work boots in winter , and then he could wear whatever socks he wanted and no one would see . He still felt the novelty of showering , dressing , and hitting the road in ten minutes flat , and what a road . No traffic . No other cars . No horns . No cops . No speed limit . The road he drove now was framed by trees just shy of their peak of fall color . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake and was cracked by years of frost heaves . Most other roads in town were the same . They imposed speed limits all on their own , and Lake Henry liked it that way . The town did n't cater to tourists as many of the surrounding lake towns did . There was no inn . There were no chic little shops . Despite a perennial brouhaha in the state legislature , there was no public access to the shore . Anyone who went out on the lake was either a resident , a friend of a resident , or a trespasser . At that particular moment in time , with summer residents gone and only year-rounders left , the town 's population was 1,721 . Eleven babies were due , which would raise the count . Twelve citizens were terminally old or terminally ill , which would lower it . There were twenty-eight kids currently in college . Whether they would return was a toss-up . In John 's day they left and never came back , but that was starting to change . He made what he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but got to talking national politics with Charlie Owens , who owned the store ; and then Charlie 's wife , Annette , told him that Stu and Amanda Watson 's college junior , Hillary , was home for a quick day after a lastminute decision to spend the semester abroad . Since Hillary had interned for John two summers before , he had a personal stake in her success , so he detoured to her house to get the story , take her picture , and wish her luck . Back in the center of town , he turned in at the post office and continued on to the thin yellow Victorian that stood between it and the lake . Climbing from the truck  --  a Chevy Tahoe , one of the perks of the job  --  he reached across the seat for his briefcase , shouldered its strap , and scooped up the day 's editions of four different newspapers , a bag of doughnuts , and his thermos . With the bag clutched in his teeth he sifted through his key ring as he crossed the dirt drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sifting when he shouldered open the screen . The door behind it was mahogany , highly varnished , and carved by a local artist . Between swirls on its bottom half were a dozen slots identified by small brass plaques . The first row , politely , was devoted to the neighboring towns  --  Ashcroft , Hedgeton , Cotter Cove , and Center Sayfield . The lower rows were Lake Henry-specific , with slots assigned to things like Police and Fire , Congregational Church , Textile Mill , and Garden Club . Eye-high on the door , with no slot attached , was the largest plaque . Lake News , it read . The door moved even before John inserted his key . As he elbowed it the rest of the way open , the phone began to ring . " Jenny ? " he called . " Jenny ? " " In the bathroom ! " came the muted yell . Nothing new there , he thought . But at least she had come . Tossing his keys on the kitchen table in passing , he took the stairs two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the third . There were no dividing walls up here , which made it the largest room in the house . The addition of a slew of windows and skylights also made it the brightest . Most important , it was the only one with a view of the lake . That view was n't nearly as good as the one from John 's house , but it was better than no view at all , which was what the lower rooms in the Victorian offered . Three willows , arm in arm and more fat than tall , saw to that . The attic room had been his office since he had returned to town , three years before . It was large enough to house the newspaper 's sales department , the production department , and the editorial department . Each had a desk and a view of the lake . That view kept John focused and sane . The phone continued to ring . Letting the papers slip to the editorial desk , he dropped the bag from Charlie 's on top , stood the thermos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was clear now . Sun spilled down the slopes of the east hills , setting fire to foliage in its path before running out over the water . A month before , it would have hit a dozen boats captained by summer folk who were grabbing precious last minutes on the lake before closing up camp for the year . The only boat on the water today was one of Marlon Dewey 's prized Chris-Crafts . The sun bounced off its polished oak deck and glittered in the wake spreading behind . He picked up the phone . " Morning , Armand . " " Took you long enough , " his publisher said in a rusty voice . " Where you been ? " John followed the course of the handsome Chris-Craft . Marlon was at the helm , along with two visiting grandchildren . " Oh , out and around . " The old man 's voice softened . " ' Oh , out and around . ' You give me that every time , John , and you know I ca n't argue with it . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what goes on around yours . But the paper 's my bottom line , and you 're doing that okay . Long as it keeps up , you can sleep as late as you want . Did you get my piece ? Liddie put it in the slot . " " It 's there , " John said without checking , because Armand Bayne 's wife was totally reliable . She was also totally devoted to her husband . What Armand wanted done , she did . " What else you got ? " the old man asked . John clamped the phone between shoulder and ear and pulled a handful of papers from the briefcase . He had dummied the week 's pages at home the night before . Now he spread out the sheets . " The lead is a report on the education bill that 's up before the state legislature . It 's a thirty-inch piece , across the top and down the right-hand leg , photo lower left . I 'm following it with opinion pieces , one from the local rep , one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your editorial say about it ? " " You know what it says . " " The na-tives wo n't like it . " " Maybe not , but we either put money into schools today or into welfare tomorrow . " The source of that money was the problem . Not wanting to argue it again with Armand , who was one of the wealthiest of the landowners and would be soaked if property taxes doubled , he pulled up the next dummy . " Page three leads with a report on Chris Diehl 's trial  --  closing arguments , jury out , verdict in , Chris home . I have a piece on profit sharing at the mill , and one on staff cutbacks at the retirement home . The newcomer profile is on Thomas Hook . " " Ca n't stand the guy , " Armand muttered . John uncapped the thermos . " That 's because he has no people skills , but he has computer skills . There 's reason why his business is worth twenty million and growing . " " He 's a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na do with that kind of money ? " John filled his mug with coffee . " He 's thirty-two , with a wife and three kids , and in the six months he 's been here , he 's tripled the size of his house , regraded and graveled the approach road , built another house for an office in the place where a god-awful eyesore stood , and in doing all that , he 's used local contractors , carpenters , masons , plumbers , and electricians  --  " " All right , all right , " Armand 's growl cut him off . " What else ? " Sipping coffee , John pulled up the next page . " There 's an academy update  --  message from the head of the school . New year starting , one hundred twelve kids , twenty-two states , seven countries . Then there 's police news , fire news , library news . " He flipped open the Wall Street Journal and absently scanned the headlines . " There 's the week in review from papers in Boston , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week "  --  he knew Armand would like that  --  " including a two-pager from the outlets in Conway . Fall 's a good time for ads . " " Praised be , " said Armand . " What else ? " " School news . Historical Society news . Tri-town soccer news . " " Want some breaking news ? " John always wanted breaking news . It was one of the city things he missed most . Feeling a twinge of anticipation , he sank into his desk chair , brought up a blank screen , and prepared to type . Armand said , " They just read Noah Thacken 's will , and the family 's in a stew . He left the house to daughter number two , so daughter number one is threatening to sue , and daughter number three is threatening to leave town , and none of them is talking to the others . Look into it , John . " But John had retracted his hands and was rocking back in his chair . " That 's private stuff " " Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . " " Right , so why put it in the paper ? Besides , we print facts . " " This is facts . That will is a matter of public record . " " The will is . Not the personal trauma . That 's speculation , and it 's exploitative . I thought we agreed  --  " " Well , there is n't a hell of a lot of other excitement up here , " the old man remarked and hung up the phone . No , John thought , there is n't a bell of a lot of other exitement up here . No fascinating book material in an education bill , a computer mogul , or a family squabble ; and Christopher Diehl 's bank fraud trial was a far cry from the murder trials he used to cover . His eye went to the wall of framed photos at the far end of the room . There was one of him interviewing a source on Boston 's City Hall Plaza , and another of him typing at his computer with the phone clamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . There were photos of him shaking hands with national politicians , and of him laughing it up with colleagues in Boston bars . There was one of a Christmas party  --  he and Marley in the newsroom with a crowd of their friends . And there was a blowup of his Post ID mug shot . His hair was short , his jaw tight , his eyes tired , his face pale . He looked like he was either about to miss the story of his career or severely constipated . The photos were trappings of an earlier life , like the deactivated police scanner that sat on a file cabinet beneath them . Listening to police or fire reports had been a way of life once . No bona fide newsroom was without one . So he had started his tenure at Lake News by setting one up , but static without voices for hours on end had grown old fast . Besides , he personally knew everyone who would be involved in breaking news . If anything happened , they called him , and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . She was his answering service . She was the answering service for half the town . If she did n't find him one place , she found him somewhere else . In three years , he had n't missed a local emergency . How many had there been ... two ... three ... four ? Nope , no big best-seller would ever come from covering emergencies in Lake Henry . With a sigh he dropped the phone into its cradle , pulled a doughnut from the bag , added more coffee to his mug , and tipped back his chair . He had barely crossed his feet on the desk when Jenny Blodgett appeared at the door . She was nineteen , pale and blond , and so thin that the big bulge of the baby in her belly looked doubly wrong . Knowing that she probably had n't eaten breakfast , he rocked forward in the chair , came to his feet , and brought her the bag . " It is n't milk or meat , but it 's better than nothing , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her office was on the first floor , in the room that had once been a parlor . He followed her there , eyed the papers on the desk , thought he detected what may have been separate piles . " How 's it going ? " Her voice was soft and childlike . " Okay . " She pointed to each of those vague piles in turn . " This year 's letters to the editor . Last year 's . The year before 's . What do I do now ? " He had told her twice . But she worked sporadic hours , had n't been in since the Wednesday before , and had probably lived a nightmare since then  --  or so the rationale went . She was n't exactly competent , had barely made it through high school , and was trained for nothing . But she was carrying his cousin 's child . He wanted to give her a break . So , gently , he said , " Put them in alphabetical order and file them in the cabinet . Did you type out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were red rimmed , which meant she had either been up all night or crying this morning . " I forgot , " she whispered . " No problem . You can do it now . What say we set a goal ? Labels typed and stuck on file folders , and letters filed in the appropriate folders before you leave today . Sound fair ? " She nodded quickly . " Eat first , " he reminded her on his way out the door and went to the kitchen to collect the contents of the bins . Up in his office again , he ate his doughnut at the window overlooking the lake . The Woody had disappeared and its wake been played out , but the water had lost its smoothness . A small breeze ruffled it in shifting patches . Beneath his window the willows whispered and swayed . Shoving up the screen , he ducked his head and leaned out . Corned beef hash was frying at Charlie 's . The breeze brought the smell across the street and down to the water . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the town pier , which jutted from a narrow swath of sandy beach . On his right , yellow-leafed birches angled out over low shrubs that led to rocks and then water . There were houses farther on , yearround homes too stately to be called camps , but most were tucked into coves , hidden around bends , or blocked from view by islands . He could see the tips of a few docks , even a weathered raft still anchored to the floor of the lake . It would be hauled in soon , and the docks taken apart and stored . The lake would be bare . The phone rang . Letting the screen drop , he waited to see if Jenny would answer it . After three rings , he did it himself . " Lake News . " " John , this is Allison Quimby , " said a bold voice . " My place is falling apart . I need a handyman . Everyone I 've used before is still working up at Hook 's . Is it too late to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the sales desk . I 'll transfer you . " He put her on hold , jogged across the room , and picked up the phone at the sales desk . " Okay . " He slipped into the chair there and began at the computer . " I 'm pulling up classified ads . Here we go . Do you have something written ? " He suspected she did . Allison Quimby owned the local realty company and was the quintessential professional . Of course she had something written . " Of course I have something written . " She read . He typed . He fiddled with the spacing , helped her edit it to make it work better , suggested a heading , quoted her a price , took her credit card number . As soon as he hung up the phone , he made a call of his own . A tired voice answered . " Yeah . " " It 's me . Allison Quimby needs a handyman . Give her a call ? " When he heard a soft swearing , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . " " Who are you , my fuckin ' guardian angel ? " John kept his voice low and tight . " I 'm your fuckin ' older cousin , the one who 's worried about the girl you knocked up , the one who 's thinking you may not be worth the effort but that girl and her baby are . Come on , Buck .. You 're good with your hands , you can do what Allison needs done , she pays well , and she 's got a big mouth if she likes what you do . " He read the phone number once , then read it again . " Call her , " he said and hung up the phone . Seconds later he was back at the window by the editorial desk . Seconds after that he had a grip on his patience . All it took was a good long look at the lake and the reminder that people like Buck and Jenny did n't have that . They had the Ridge , where houses were too small , too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone battling alcoholism , physical abuse , or chronic unemployment . John knew . He had the Ridge in his blood as well . He would hear it , feel it , smell it until the day he died . A movement on the lake caught his eye , the flash of red on a distant dock . He focused in on it ; then , half smiling , took a pair of binoculars from the bottom drawer of the desk and focused through those . Shelly Cole was stretched out on a lounge chair , all sleek and oiled in the sun . She was a well-made woman , he had to say that . But then , Cole women had been sorely tempting the men of Lake Henry for three generations . For the most part they were kind creatures who grew into fine wives and mothers . Shelly was something else . She was heading back to Florida in a week , when the weather here became too cool for her to flaunt her tan . John would n't miss her . He might be as tempted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a ten-foot pole . With a slight shift of the binoculars , he was looking at Hunter 's Island . Named after its first owners , rather than any sport there , it was another of the tiny islands that dotted the lake , and it did have a house , albeit a seasonal one . The Hunter family had summered there for more than a century , before selling it to its current owners . Those owners , the LaDucs , were teaching their third generation of children to swim from its small pebbled beach . Strange family , the LaDucs . There were nearly as many scandals woven through its generations as there were Hunter scandals . Growing up , John had heard rumors about both families . Returning as an adult who knew how to snoop , he had done research , asked around , made notes . They were locked in his file cabinet now , along with the rest of his private stuff , but none were crying out to be a book . Maybe he had n't read them in the right frame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize them . Or chronologize them . Maybe something would hit him . After three years he should have come up with something . The phone rang . He picked it up after the first ring . " Lake News . " " Hi , Kip . It 's Poppy . " John grinned . How not to , when conjuring up Poppy Blake ? She was a smiling pixie , always bright and upbeat . " Hi , sweetheart . How 's it going ? " " Busy , " she said , making it sound wonderful . " I have someone named Terry Sullivan on the line to your house . Do you want me to patch him through ? " John 's eye flew to the wall of photographs , to one of the prints in which he was partying with other reporters . Terry Sullivan was the tall , lean , dark one , the one with the mustache that hid a sneer , the one who always stood on the edge of the crowd so that he could beat the rest out if a story broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fault , and would n't know loyalty if it hit him in the face . He had personally betrayed John , and more than once . John wondered where he found the gall to call . Terry Sullivan had been one of the first to blow him off when he decided to leave Boston . Curious , he told Poppy to make the connection . When it happened , he said , " Kipling here . " " Hey , Kip . It 's Terry Sullivan . How goes it , bro ? " Bro ? John took his time answering . " It goes fine . And you ? " " Aaah , same old rat race here , you know how it is . Well , you used to . It must be pretty quiet up there . There are times when I think I 'll retire to the sticks , then I think again . It is n't me , if you know what I mean . " " I sure do . People up here are honest . You 'd stick out like a sore thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was blunt . " " People up here are blunt , too . So , what do you want , Terry ? I do n't have long . We have deadlines here , too . " " O-kay . Chuck the small talk . I 'm calling journalist to journalist . There 's a woman named Lily Blake , born there , living here . Tell me all you know . " John slipped into his chair . Lily was Poppy 's sister , the elder , but barely , which would make her thirty-fourish . She had left Lake Henry to go to college and had stayed in the city for a graduate degree . In music , he thought . He had heard she was teaching . And that she played the piano . And that she had a great body . Folks around town still talked about her voice . She had been singing in church when she was five , but John was n't a churchgoer , and long before she would have been old enough to sing at Charlie 's back room Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back several times since he had returned-once for her father 's funeral , other times for Thanksgiving or Christmas , but never for longer than a day or two . From what he heard , she and her mother did n't get along . John might not know Lily , but he did know Maida . She was one tough lady . For that reason and others , he was inclined to give Lily the benefit of the doubt when it came to who was at fault . " Lily Blake ? " he asked Terry , sounding vague . " Come on , Kip . The place is tiny . Do n't go dumb on me . " " If she does n't live here , how in the hell am I supposed to know about her ? " " Fine . Tell me about her family . Who 's alive and who is n't ? What do they do ? What kind of people are they ? " " Why do you want to know ? " " I met her . I 'm thinking of dating her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thinking of dating her ? Fat chance . Lily Blake was a stutterer-much improved from childhood , he understood , but Terry Sullivan did n't date women with problems . They demanded more than he wanted to give . " Is this part of some story ? " John asked , though he could n't imagine what part Lily could play in a story that interested Terry . " Nah . Purely personal . " " And you 're calling me ? " They might have been colleagues , but they 'd never been friends . Terry missed the point . Chuckling , he said , " Yeah , I thought it was pretty funny , myself I mean , here she comes from this tiny town in the middle of nowhere , and it just happens to be the same place where you 're hiding out . " " Not hiding . I 'm totally visible . " " It was a figure of speech . Are we touchy ? " " No , Terry , we 're pressed for time . Tell me why you really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " " Okay . It 's not me . It 's my friend . He 's the one who wants to date her . " John knew a he when he heard one . He hung up the phone , but his hand did n't leave the receiver . Waiting only long enough to sever the connection with Terry , he snatched it back up and signaled for Poppy . " Hey , Kip , " she said seconds later in her sassy , smiling voice . " That was fast . What can I do for you now ? " " Two things , " John said . He was on his feet , one hand holding the phone to his ear , the other cocked on his hip . " First , do n't let that man speak to anyone in town . Cut him off , drop the line , do whatever you have to . He 's not a good person . Second , tell me about your sister . " " About Rose ? " " About Lily . What 's she been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
