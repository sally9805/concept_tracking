Have you hedged your portfolio against the falling dollar ? If not , there 's still time to act . Since January 2002 the greenback has declined 25% against the euro and 16% against the Japanese yen . And many foreign-exchange experts say the dollar may drop an additional 5% to 10% against major currencies over the next year . One key reason for the dollar 's woes is the bulging U.S. trade deficit , which is likely to top $600 billion , or 6% of GDP , in 2004 . <P> Lower U.S. interest rates have also led fixed-income investors to seek out countries offering higher rates . And the swelling budget deficit , which threatens to slow U.S. economic growth , has cast doubt on the greenback 's outlook just as many overseas economies are starting to rebound . Says Marc Chandler , chief currency strategist at HSBC USA bank : " The dollar is in a long-term decline . " <P> The weakening greenback hurts returns by dragging down the value of dollar-denominated assets , notably U.S. stocks and bonds . Foreign investors keep their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge the impact of a further dollar decline on investments , RiskMetrics Group , a New York City quantitative-research firm , ran a so-called economic-stress test , which analyzes statistical correlations between currency moves and the markets . If the euro and the yen each rise an additional 10% against the dollar from levels in early November , the study found , the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index could slip 0.6% , which means that a $10,000 bond would lose about $60 . It would cost the S &P; 500 index 3.4% , the NASDAQ 4.5% and the Dow 3.2% . On opposite shores , RiskMetrics found that the weaker dollar could cause the FTSE 100 to edge up 0.43% , while the Nikkei might zoom 12.97% . Says RiskMetrics strategist Mike Thompson : " The findings reaffirm the importance of owning both U.S. and foreign investments . " <P> The most direct way to hedge against the falling dollar is to invest in foreign currencies . But active foreign-exchange trading is a high-wire act . Instead , consider buying CDs that are denominated in major foreign currencies .

So consider this strategy for only a small portion of your portfolio . <P> Emerging-market bonds are another way to capitalize on the dollar 's plunge . In addition to the currency kick , many developing-country issues offer higher yields than U.S. Treasuries . Emerging-market bond funds have already had a mighty run , gaining 32.5% over the past 12 months . But Leila Heckman , head of Heckman Global Advisers , believes these markets have further to grow . For most individuals , the best way to invest is through an emerging-markets bond fund . A top choice is PIMCO Emerging Markets Bond , which has ranked in the upper 20% of its peer group . Its current yield : 5.09%.                  @ @ @
