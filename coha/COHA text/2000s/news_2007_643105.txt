<p> Now that women have solidly earned their place in the work force , many find themselves still yearning for something men often have : wives . <p> " The thing I most want in life is a wife . I 'm not kidding , " said Joyce Lustbader , a research scientist at Columbia University , who has been married for 29 years . " I work all day , sometimes seven days a week , and still have to go home and make dinner and have all those things to do around the house . " <p> It is not just the extra shift at home that is a common complaint . Working women , whether married or single , also see their lack of devoted spousal support as an impediment to getting ahead in their careers , especially when they are competing against men who have wives behind them , whether those wives are working or staying at home . And research supports their argument : it appears that marriage , at least marriage with children , bolsters a man 's career but hinders a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed wife envy as something women " are usually joking about " and another called it " a need for a second set of hands , regardless of gender . " But therapists who work with couples on equality issues say it is no joke . <p> " I hear it all the time , " said Robin Stern , a psychotherapist in Manhattan and author of " The Gaslight Effect . " " It 's a real concern . Things that used to be routinely taken care of during the week are not anymore . " <p> With two-income families now the norm , and both men and women working a record-breaking number of hours , the question has become how to accomplish what used to be a wife 's job , even as old-fashioned standards of household management and entertaining have been relaxed . Many men are sharing the work of chores and child care with their wives , and some do it all as single parents , but women still generally shoulder a greater burden of household business ( or fretting over how to do what is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , one in five men engages in some kind of housework on an average day , while more than half of women do . <p> " The real challenge is , companies expect you to perform as if someone is at home taking care of everything for you , " said Kim Gandy , president of the National Organization for Women . " Some men are better positioned to deal with these corporate demands , because they do have someone at home . Most women do n't . " <p> Working women have noticed , correctly , that their male colleagues with wife support  --  whether or not those wives are themselves working outside the home  --  get further at work than the women who are fettered by marriage and children . Women occupy 50.6 percent of managerial and professional positions , according to the research organization Catalyst , but make up only 15.6 percent of Fortune 500 corporate officers . <p> Married men and women , on average , earn more than those who are unmarried , with part of that possibly attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be married ) . But the gap is significantly larger for men than for women . Married women make an average 17 percent more than unmarried women , according to 2005 B.L.S. data on the median earnings of full-time workers , while married men make 42 percent more than unmarried men . <p> A more statistically rigorous analysis published in 2004 , using the Minnesota Twins Registry , tried to isolate the effect of marriage on earnings . It found that holding education and genetics constant , married male twins made 26 percent more than their unmarried brothers . <p> It is not as clear what effect marriage has on women 's careers and earnings , but having children is , over all , an impediment . " There 's a well-documented motherhood penalty : women with children are paid less than women without children , " controlling for other factors , said Mary Blair-Loy , a sociologist and author of " Competing Devotions , " a study of executive women who kept working versus ones who discontinued their careers . <p> Fathers , however , are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being parents , according to more than one study , including one published in March in The American Journal of Sociology . <p> In 1972 , the first issue of Ms. Magazine included a now classic essay by Judy Syfers , " I Want a Wife . " Her fantasies included her wife taking the children to the park and on play dates , arranging a social life , passing hors d'oeuvres to guests , planning meals , cooking , cleaning . The sentiment seems to persist among today 's working women . <p> " On every level , I 'm very resentful , " Ms. Lustbader said . " Not of my husband , but of other women who do n't work , or who have a stay-at-home husband . " She calls her marriage a good one . She also has the benefit of a once-a-week housecleaner and had live-in help while the couple 's two children were growing up . She did not pursue a tenure track because she wanted to be more available for her children while they were growing up . <p> While outsourcing household work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't solve all the issues . Women are still predominantly the ones hiring and managing the help , according to Ms. Blair-Loy and other specialists . And , especially when it comes to child care , they feel there is no substitute for a spouse . <p> " The situation is , you have to have people doing it for you , or you do it , " said Dawn Santana , a corporate lawyer in Manhattan who works part time . " I like to do it myself , and do n't trust too many other people . But I would trust a spouse . " <p> Even if the workload is divided , women complain that they are usually the ones organizing , juggling and filling their head space with the daily demands of family life . That leaves less time and energy to focus on the workplace tasks . <p> " Men lock the door and leave . Things could be a wreck or whatever and it does n't affect their other world , " Ms. Santana said . " I walk out and worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play dates , etc . Someone has to worry about that , and it 's usually not the dad . " <p> Ms. Santana 's husband , Gus Moore , who works in finance , does not see it the same way . " We both do whatever we can do while we 're not sleeping , " he said . Regarding the earnings advantage of married men , he commented : " I ca n't think of why that would be . I ca n't think of what they 'd be doing that would cause that . " He has noticed that some married colleagues bring a lunch from home , which he guesses has been packed by the wife , but he doubts that it would increase anyone 's paycheck . <p> The argument is made , even by feminists , that an unmarried man might face the same challenges and wife-envy as does a woman without a nonworking spouse to support her life and career . But a common response is that the situations are not the same , because of individual and societal expectations that tend disproportionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher expectations and hold themselves to higher standards , " said Sumru Erkut , associate director of the Wellesley Centers for Women . Or , as Mr. Moore put it , " I assume most bachelors do n't worry about how clean their houses are . " Consequently , women tend to feel they should do more , even with a full-time job . " In the workplace , or any place men and women are competing , men who are married have an advantage over married or unmarried women , " Ms. Erkut said . <p> Ms. Lustbader says that men at her workplace have invited their colleagues to their houses for barbecues that were organized by their wives . " I heard about them , how lovely it was , " she said . " I do n't do that . " Male counterparts have also had cocktail parties at their homes for other faculty members . " I never did that . It was another chore I did n't want to do .

He also expresses the desire for a devoted , trustworthy helper . " He feels the same way , " Ms. Santana said , " but he calls it a mom . Now we just say we want a mommy . " <p> #
