Applied for a job lately ? Then your prospective employer probably knows how you spend your Saturday nights . Your could-be boss may also know more about your bathroom habits , sexual preferences and deep thoughts than does the person who shares your bed . <P> That 's if you , like millions of other job applicants , submitted to a personality test . At least 30% of employers  --  from governments to hospitals , restaurants to law firms , Wal-Mart to DuPont  --  use a version of the tests in hiring . Even CEOS get tested , which makes sense given their salaries . Carly Fiorina reportedly took a 900-question test before landing the top job at Hewlett-Packard . <P> Although the tests have been around for more than a century , employers have increasingly glommed on to them for one main purpose : retention . Companies yearn to nip turnover , which averages about 15% across the workforce and costs at least a quarter of a departing worker 's salary . Poorly performing employees are costly , to the tune of $100 billion a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to predict a worker 's " fit " with the job and corporate culture  --  thereby increasing chances that the hire will stick . ( H-P , of course , may want its money back ; Fiorina was ousted last year . ) <P> Computerization has made administering the tests easier and cheaper , helping the industry grow to about 2,500 companies raking in $400 million a year . Here 's what you need to know : <P> What do personality tests measure ? It depends on the test . " Screen-out " tests like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) are used to detect the proclivity toward substance abuse and psychopathology ; 60% of police departments in the U.S. use the MMPI . The California Psychological Inventory , a popular " screen-in " test , can help determine the right person for the job by attempting to predict how someone will behave . The Myers-Briggs is frequently used by employers on existing employees to measure leadership and teamwork skills . Other tests gauge dependability , stress management and motivation . <P> How accurate are they ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sackett , a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota who has studied the tests for 25 years . But standards have improved vastly over the past decade , thanks to the emergence of a uniform language involving five main types of behavior . The testing industry remains largely unregulated , however . " There 's still a Wild West of unsupported , unproven tests out there , " says Annie Murphy Paul , author of The Cult of Personality Testing . <P> Can you game a personality test ? Yes , say books and websites that purport to tell you how . Applicants often try to answer questions to make themselves look attractive . But tests have got better at fingering the liars , mainly by arranging questions to indicate a pattern  --  " a lie scale , if you will , " says Sackett . Dinah Daniels , CEO of testing company PI Worldwide , says built-in alarms go off when an applicant is faking . Says Sackett : " My advice is to take the test at face value and describe yourself clearly and honestly . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , maybe it was n't for you .
