This Is Not a Test I was finishing up a week at Camp Tomahawk in Utah when the fire alarm went off . It was loud and obnoxious , just like the day before during a drill . This was another drill-I thought-so I grabbed my shoes and wallet . Then , I looked over to my left . The sky was orange . // The color was coming from clouds of smoke . That 's when the fright started to kick in . This was real ! We hiked to a neighboring camp where we would receive our evacuation instructions . We reached our destination and got the plan . The Scout leaders would go to the parking lot and get their cars . The rest of us would line up along the side of the road and wait to be picked up and taken about 10 miles away . It was weird just looking down the road seeing all the Scouts lined up and waiting to be taken from danger . And with all the cars coming , it looked like a big parade . Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving in a little Honda Civic down a rocky dirt road . We started to smell something burning . We also realized that the road seemed a lot bumpier . My friend looked out the side mirror and realized that one tire had been torn to shreds . We were almost riding on the rims . We jumped out and changed the tire-in about five minutes . We started hearing sirens that kept getting louder and louder until they finally reached us . Everybody started cheering and clapping for the firemen as they drove by . About 20 minutes later , we had made it out . As my dad and I drove away , we looked at the mountains and saw huge columns of white smoke going up into the clouds . Two weeks later , we received word that the rest of our equipment was O.K. , and our leaders could go back and get it . They had to wear fire suits just in case anything happened . The whole experience was scary . It made us realize even more how important it is to keep our fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect our forests . - Robby White , South Jordan , Utah Go Kart . No , Stop ! My parents got me a go-kart engine . I bought a kit and put it together . A few weeks later , I was starting it . I turned the choke on , pulled the starter cord , turned the choke , and it took off ( without me on it ) . My dad ran after it and managed to steer it into a tree . // That bent the tie rod but prevented the go-kart from going into the road . We bent the tie rod back , adjusted the idle and in a few minutes , I was back on it . - Jordan Kennedy , Forks , Wash . Rafting Each summer I go up to my grandpa 's farm , which has several ponds . One year I decided I wanted to make a raft . My grandpa got me some lumber , and we crafted a seaworthy vessel . // A few days after that , my uncle came to visit . I persuaded him to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we were both on it , I shoved off . When we were in the middle of the pond , my uncle walked over to the edge of the raft , and it started sinking . My uncle got scared and jumped off the raft and started flailing about in the chest-deep water . Rolling with laughter , I began shouting , " Man overboard ! " When my dripping wet uncle emerged from the water , he started laughing , too . - Sam Mills , Clemmons , N.C. Dog on a Log My dad and I were coming home from a camp-out when we drove by a lake and heard some dogs barking . My dad stopped the car , and we both got out . I looked over at the lake and saw two puppies on a log close to the shore . My dad and I got a long stick and pushed the log to the edge . My dad put the dogs on the ground and they ran off . I was happy we saved them . - Samuel N.
