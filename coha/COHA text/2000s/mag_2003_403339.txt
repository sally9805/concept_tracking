Welcome to Marin County , birthplace of mountain biking-and of mountain biking 's hottest , angriest , most violent bike-advocacy battle . Coming soon to a trail near you . // MARK WEIR SHOULD HAVE IT MADE . His parents moved a couple of years ago , leaving him in charge of the family home . He has a bunch of buddies to live with , a good job , and a dozen or so mountain bikes in the garage . At 10 on a Saturday morning , the house , in Novato , California , 20 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge , is buzzing . The roommates are tearing into cartons of orange juice , rolling scrambled eggs into breakfast burritos and talking bikes . The talk is about joy . And trouble . " I can never remember a time when hiking was n't part of my life , " says Weir , a nationally ranked downhill racer . " When I was a kid , my dad used to take me out and challenge me . I 'd get a dollar if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Weir also ca n't remember a time when Marin , the modern birthplace of the sport of off-road cycling , did n't seem like the mountain-bike capital of the universe . " It 's an amazing place , " he says . Then , the mood turns glum : Though there are nearly 200 miles of singletrack on and around Mt . Tamalpais , mountain hiking 's mother hill , it 's now illegal to ride bikes on all but about 22 miles of them . ( About 160 miles of fire roads are also open for bicycling . ) Conflicts between cyclists and hikers , runners and equestrians have turned uglier and uglier . Sometimes even violent . In another part of the world , Weir 's athletic achievements might make him a local hero . Here , he 's an outlaw . Nobody knows how many of Marin 's riders take to their favorite trails only at night , or when the weather 's too hot for anyone else , or on lonely weekday mornings when the region 's trademark mist hides them from pursuing rangers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local authorities and prompt the installation of various gauntlets , official and otherwise : speed guns , ranger stakeouts , and surreptitiously placed spikes and lacerating obstacles . " I wish I could figure out why we 're so hated , " Weir says . " These are my neighbors . " Marin has long been both a bellwether and a battle-ground . The first successful battles against suburban sprawl were fought here in the 1960s , creating an early model for environmental activism . Mountain-hiking court cases in Marin , like the one cycling advocates lost in 1992 when they sued to gain access to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area , set national precedent , as do the opinions of the highly vocal Marin chapter of the Sierra Club . Entrenched positions on both sides have led to name-calling and a screw-you , screw-the-rules attitude that sets the tone for much of the rest of the United States . The International Mountain Bicycling Association ( IMBA ) has identified dozens of areas where bike access is threatened . Proposals to turn many of Southern California 's most popular mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are gaining ground . Trails as far from Marin as those in Boston 's Middlesex Fells or New Jersey 's South Mountain network are rocked by fierce fights over whether bikes should be allowed . " As technology has improved and training has improved and bikes have gotten lighter , people can ride faster and on more difficult stuff , " says Tim Blumenthal , president of IMBA . " Add more people in the outdoors , " Blumenthal says , " and you get into great difficulties with sharing access . " Weir acknowledges that many of the trails he rides are off-limits to bikes . And he knows that poaching is n't good public relations . But the prohibitions are unfair and arbitrary , he says . Weir heads out to his garage , which the four roommates have divided into quadrants so bike parts wo n't get mixed up . " Give us a place to be legal and right , " he says , " and we will be . Give us nothing , and we 'll be angry . " MARIN COUNTY IS A MIRACLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . As San Francisco 's immediate northern suburb , the county barely escaped being turned into another California morass of freeways and subdivisions . Until the 1970s , there were active plans to level the hills , populate the rugged Pacific coast and cut aqueducts through the region 's trickling watersheds . Planned population : nearly 2 million , instead of the 250,000 that inhabit the county today . Marin 's centerpiece is 2,600-foot Mt . Tamalpais-Tam to most residents-which cuts a bumpy profile along the county 's midsection . Much of Marin is a rich , moist green , fed by the chilly mists that Sir Francis Drake , the pirate who explored the area in 1579 , called " ye stinking fogge . " Development has mostly been limited to Tam 's east side . Highway 101 snakes up from the south , creating corridors of mini-sprawl that quickly peter out into tiny towns that push into the hillsides . Each Marin community has a different personality , but the general vibe is baby-boomer affluence and fading hippydom : a Volvo in every driveway , a yoga studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridges ; networks of trails meander from them . West , Tam slopes into a whirl of almost completely undeveloped bays and lagoons . The 75-mile shoreline includes the Golden Gate National Recreation Area , the Point Reyes National Seashore and the Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve . Tam 's interior is a blend of sanctuary and playground . There are public campgrounds and private wildlife refuges , protected watersheds and exclusive equestrian ranches . Tam is close enough to San Francisco , and wedded enough to the 1960s , that an afternoon spent on the trail might yield encounters from Boy Scouts , nude Ultimate-Frisbee players , church groups and marijuana planters . More than 2 million people play on Mt . Tam annually , according to state statistics . Mountain bikers know Marin as the place where modern off-road cycling was popularized , starting in the late 1970s then booming through the ' 80s and ' 90s . But as hallowed as Tam 's two-wheeled trails are , the area 's sacrosanct nature is far more broad : The saving of Tam ranks as one of the greatest environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after World War II , gave birth to a new and effective form of activism that has become standard for today 's conservationists , according to Dr. L. Martin Griffin , author of Saving the Marin-Sonoma Coast . Griffin , who was president of the Marin Audubon Society in the 1960s , grew up in Oakland and first discovered Tam as a teenager . " We 'd hike to the top of the mountain and see this incredible panorama : Bolinas Lagoon , Point Reyes , " he says . " And I thought , ' I 'm going to live here one day . ' " But when Griffin returned to his beloved county after the war , the Marin of his dreams was poised to vanish . " The place was about to go down the tubes , " he says . Griffin unrolls a dusty map onto his living-room table : The " West Marin General Plan " envisioned a county of shopping malls and culde-sacs with flattened contours and paved trails ; on the map , a freeway exits across Tam 's top ridge , two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the face of stiff commercial interests , Griffin helped launch a guerilla war . " We 'd gain footholds and use them as leverage , " he says . By purchasing strategic parcels of land , getting zoning regulations changed , and picking away at support for development ( Griffin , an internal medicine specialist , proselytized his patients as he examined them ) , the activists created a patchwork of interlocking protectorates . Today , though much of the county looks like continuous open space , it is administered by more than a dozen agencies , private and public ; federal , state and local . The disorganization , Griffin says , keeps things honest : " The groups compete with each other . That 's one of the reasons we got the outcome we did . " The chaos kept Tam green . Nobody imagined it would become as troubled as any big city . IN TAMOPOLIS , population density varies , swelling on weekends and easing when the weather 's cold . Tamopolis has no skyscrapers or mass transit , though it does possess a controlling cabal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic political-machine style . The feuds and grudges that characterize fights to control Marin 's open space have gone on for decades . There have always been odd and insular battles here , says Griffin : " Environmentalists in Marin do tend to go overboard . " The mountain bike arrived at a time of relative peace . You 've probably heard the official version of the sport 's history : Longhairs modified old Schwinns so they could bomb down fire roads , then added gears to climb hills and the phenomenon spread , going global by the 1990s . There are many reasons the mountain bike hit big in Marin . The era was mellow , dedicated to fun ; creative horticulturists needed rugged machines to quickly access private stashes ; and yuppies had a penchant for fancy toys . A tragic bit of timing may have had something to do with it as well . In 1979 , the body of a young woman was found near one of Tam 's hiking trails . Over the next two years , nine more people were murdered by the Trailside Killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could move faster and usually traveled in groups , kept visiting . In May 1981 , a San Francisco photo technician named David Carpenter was charged with the crimes ; he was convicted three years later . One mountain bike pioneer , who asked not to be named , says he thinks the brief abandonment of Tam by hikers allowed the early bike scene to flourish . The hikers returned to a changed mountain . Instead of a few riders on a couple of fire roads , the entire region swarmed with bikes . By the mid-1980s , the sport was big business , and several bike companies located themselves in Marin . Frank Lurz may have been Tam 's first anti-bike advocate . In 1983 , the Mill Valley fencing instructor was hiking the Steep Ravine trail-a spectacular , blissful walk through waterfalls , redwoods , tidal pools and ocean vistas-when , he says , " at least three bikers , very out of control , came by . I stepped backward and tripped . I was knocked down , into the ravine . " Lurz says he saved himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging around , smashing his foot into a rock . " I hit with such force that it lacerated my boot . By the time I reached my car , I 'd lost a lot of blood , " he says . The wound later became infected . " The bikers never even stopped , " Lurz adds . " In fact , they were laughing . " Lurz became one of a group of hikers and equestrians who wield enormous influence over many of the county 's open-space overseers and policy . They remain a formidable and organized force today . Among them are John Parulis , who videotapes those whom he considers to be involved in destructive acts , then posts photographs on his website ( brightpathvideo.com ) ; Terri Alvillar , who also posts photos of cyclists she claims are riding illegally on her site ( **49;3041;TOOLONG ) ; Mike Vandeman , who floods Internet newsgroups with angry debates over trail access ; and Connie Berto , the equestrian representative on the Marin County Open Space and Trails Committee and a member of the board of the Trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on singletrack trails . ( In an odd twist that demonstrates how complicated Marin 's problems are , Berto 's husband , Frank , is a well-respected cycling writer ; his work has appeared extensively in this magazine . ) Though each of the anti-bike advocates describes his or her motivations differently , most share the views espoused by Lurz nearly two decades after he hurt his foot : " I oppose bikes . They do n't belong here . They infuriate the hell out of me . " As to the unidentified riders who injured him , Lurz says : " I wish I could put my hands around their necks . " BY THE 1990s , LOTS OF FOLKS wanted to strangle their fellow recreationists . More and more mountain bikers were appearing on Tam , many driving north from San Francisco for weekend fun . Trail conflicts were rising . From the bikers ' perspective , things got worse and worse : Riders were banned from nearly all of the mountain 's singletracks . In 1992 , cyclists lost a lawsuit aimed at ensuring access to the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GGNRA are open to bikes , most notably the Miwok trail , a legal singletrack in the Marin Headlands . ) Town meetings and coverage in the Marin Independent Journal seemed to harp on the same issues , feature the same people and make the same arguments . To those opposed to bikes , it was a repeat of Griffin 's fight against development . " This open space did n't come here by accident , " says Rick Fraites , who studies land management issues for the county board of supervisors . " People spent a lot of time and effort to protect it , and we can not allow the resource to be destroyed just for thrills and chills . " The conflicts did n't stop bikers from showing up . Fairfax and Mill Valley , especially , were gaining reputations as bike towns . On Saturday mornings , the local coffee shops would be filled with riders , hundreds sometimes , who 'd commuted up from San Francisco . The area 's most famous rides , such as Pine Mountain , Hoo-Koo-E-Koo and Eldridge Grade , were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilderness Trail Bikes , based in Marin , used a lesser-known trail as a product namesake . The New Paradigm trail was a relatively remote singletrack , starting deep in the Tam backcountry . It was intentionally hard to find because it was " unauthorized " - built by unknown parties . When WTB chose New Paradigm as the name for a new line of parts , many in the area believed the trail itself was the work of WTB co-founder Charlie Cunningham . Cunningham had arrived in Marin during the early bike era , but was n't considered part of the pioneering crowd ( which included , most notably , Gary Fisher ) who " invented " the sport . " I tended to ride alone , " Cunningham says . " All I wanted to do was commune with nature . " Cunningham 's knack for elegant design is evident in the products he created . He invented a system that allowed riders to lubricate bike parts without disassembling them . He created one of the first high-performance off-road tires . He once designed a special water-bottle holder so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cunningham was shocked by his first personal trail conflict . " I was riding my bike over the hill to a dentist 's appointment when I was stopped by a ranger , " Cunningham says . " He told me I could n't ride my bike here . It was the first I 'd ever heard of that . " Slowly , Cunningham began realizing he was n't welcome . " We thought we 'd be seen as environmentalists , " he says . " We were told we could be accepted if we participated in the process , became part of the system . " It was n't the case . " We met consistently with hostile reactions . We were n't even allowed to perform trail maintenance ! " Cunningham began lobbying for " experimental " trails that would prove bikers could ride safely and maintain Tam 's environmental integrity . " They kept saying we 'd get those trails , but it never happened . All we wanted to show people was that bikes could fit in . " In 1993 , a ranger walking the brush found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been built " to demonstrate that bikers can ride singletrack safely and without damage . " Further investigation revealed that the trail had existed , undetected , for more than three years . It was a gorgeous piece of work , painstakingly built , diligently maintained . The trail was n't about gnarly jumps or big obstacles : It was about riding fast , flowing through the trees . The trail 's refined function and thoughtful conception , most of all , was what led people to see Cunningham 's hand in New Paradigm 's creation . Cunningham has never admitted to being one of New Paradigm 's architects , but he 's given the project plenty of thought : " I think it did good things and bad things . It showed it was possible to make a trail that was environmentally sound . But it also really catalyzed the opposition . " Throughout that summer , the New Paradigm controversy raged . The whole community seemed to be caught up in the debate . Pro-bike forces pointed out that there were hundreds of similar trails , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began citing the trail as their proof that cyclists were an outlaw band . In the end , the Marin Municipal Water District authorized New Paradigm 's erasure ; the trail 's most visible elements were re-landscaped and covered over . No official figure has been given on the cost , but the project took several workers days to complete . Witnesses say the procedure was carried out with gusto : " They were inflamed , " Cunningham says . POACHING REMAINS THE NUMBER-ONE ARGUMENT AGAINST MOUNTAIN BIKERS . " It 's pretty clear what the bike culture 's all about , " says Lurz . " When you contrast what they say and what they do , you can see : They do whatever they want . " Marin bikers seem to have frequently supplied ammunition to opponents . New trails continue to appear , and many are designed for a more aggressive riding style than the New Paradigm 's gentle ethos . Last year , local officials got word of a new trail called Medevac . Fraites walked the trail and was astonished : " I did some goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I did n't see how anybody could negotiate that terrain . " The trail was a steep chute , a cascade of drop-ins , jumps and ledges , built for burly bikes with disc brakes and five to six inches of rear suspension . Medevac was also a bikes-only trail ; it offered little to hikers or equestrians . To opponents , it became a symbol of biker excess . On anti-bike websites , riders became " bike criminals . " Videos of extreme stunts and action photos from bike magazines , even if they were taken hundreds of miles from Tam , were offered as evidence of the specific evil of Marin 's riders . " There 's no compromising , " Alvillar declared . In an effort to improve their image , some riders sided with Medevac 's opponents . Like New Paradigm , the trail was eradicated . " They arrived in pick-up trucks , " says Weir , " and destroyed it . " The discovery of Medevac came against the backdrop of an even bigger disaster for the bike community . One of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More arrived in Marin in 1979 , opening a plumbing business . He began hiking a few years later . " I was a pretty ordinary rider , " he says , " until New Paradigm . " The vehement reaction to the trail astonished More : " It was n't just that people objected , " he says . " It was the way they zealously destroyed it . It gave me a major insight into people who do n't like mountain bikes . They 're ruthless , full of hate , and they 'll do anything they can to keep us off the mountain . " He turned to activism . In 1997 , he was elected as the cyclist representative to the Open Space and Trails Committee , a position in which he frequently found himself frustrated by hikers and equestrians , who voted as a bloc . " We floated trail proposals , and every time we did , they were killed . We never had a chance , " More says . Even so , he became the quintessential work-within-the-system guy , advocating education as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 2001 , More and two others were caught building an unauthorized trail near the San Geronimo ridge , on the east side of Point Reyes . A cache of tools was discovered in the underbrush nearby . Because some of the trail was on National Park Service land , More was indicted and charged damaging federal property , a felony . " We caught him red-handed , " says Frank Dean , the area 's former chief ranger . More resigned his official post . Though he rightly points out that people have made unauthorized trails on Tam even before mountain bikes were invented , his opponents saw the incident as confirmation of arguments that previously could have been dismissed as unfounded : " If he could n't be trusted in his position , " says Connie Berto , " how could any of them ? " Facing a prison term of up to five years and financial penalties that could potentially top $500,000 , and with a clearly delighted Alvillar attending the hearings , More accepted a plea bargain . He was convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what happens when there 's prohibition , " More says . " It produces unwanted side effects , especially when it 's the only land management technique most of the administrators employ . " ALL THESE FOLKS , ARGUING ABOUT PLAYTIME . Is it surprising that the rest of the country views Marin as overly privileged , bratty and spoiled rotten ? The Marin combo of authoritarianism and libertarianism can get pretty freaky : On one of my visits , a friend and her dog came along . She took her pet for a walk , unleashing it on a trail . There was no sign explaining that dogs needed to be tethered , and my friend 's animal was n't causing trouble . Even so , when a hiker pointed out the prohibition , my friend apologized profusely , immediately tying up her animal . It was n't enough . The hiker followed her up the trail and tormented her with a lecture on " selfishness " for a full 30 minutes . Without experiencing it directly , outsiders might find it hard to believe stories about riders being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails , buried in the dirt ; or hiker complaints about bikers riding downhill runs in the rain , when it 's most environmentally damaging . There 's a lack of perspective that 's sometimes astonishing : Opponents of a recently proposed dog ban , for example , resurrected the specter of the Trailside Killer , claiming that forbidding the canine deterrent would invite a new wave of serial killers to the county . One anti-bike advocate is said to have written the U.S. Olympic Committee to ask that Susan DeMattei , the only American mountain biker to ever medal in the Games , with a bronze in Atlanta in 1996 , be stripped of her award because she allegedly poached Marin trails early in her career . Marin officials have banned the carrying of trail-building tools ; they 've attempted to raise the fine for riding on single-track to $500 . They 've even opposed paved bike paths in town , because they do n't want more people riding ( and potentially being lured off road ) . You just want to tell these folks to get a life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO END THIS STORY ON A HOPEFUL NOTE . There are three places in Marin where the different user groups seem to have reached relatively peaceful coexistence . Tamarancho is a private reserve , owned by the local Boy Scout troop , that a few years ago agreed to admit bikers on a permit basis . The trails are well-built , swoopy and fun . When anti-bike advocates attempted to close access to the area , even officials who 'd ruled against bikes in the past could- n't agree . " They voted for us , " says Jim Jacobsen , of the Bicycle Trails Council of Marin , which helped build the Tamarancho trails . " It was the highlight of any meeting I 've ever attended . " On the county 's east edge , China Camp State Park remains open to bikes ; the trails are showing heavy wear , mostly because the park is closer to the freeway and offers easier riding than Tam itself . A new trail , part of land granted to the county by filmmaker George Lucas in return for permission to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four feet wide , the trail is n't exactly singletrack . I also remembered what Marty Griffin , whose longer-term view I 'd come to appreciate , said : " These problems will be solved . The important thing is that Marin has been saved , and that 's why conflicts like these can even arise . " A good sentiment . But Griffin lives on a vineyard north of Marin and does n't get down to Tam as much as he used to . And it does n't point to the single most shameful thing about the situation in Marin : The county 's residents pride themselves on being progressive thinkers concerned with changing the world . What world are they looking at ? Not the one , it seems , where urban sprawl is destroying open space nationwide and backcountry is turned into suburb at alarming rates . Avoiding that fate is Marin 's revolutionary accomplishment . But instead of living up to its values and exporting its message so other communities learn to preserve open space , Marin turned the fight inward . Marin stopped at Marin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Weir again , who told me a story that reflects that bitter reality . He 'd been riding that morning , on legal trails , and at the top of a hill , stared down to see a hiker artfully weaving blackberry brambles-nature 's equivalent of piano wire-at chest height across the trail . A booby trap . Weir is an aggressive rider , and that pisses some people off . But I found it hard to believe that such anger could turn to violence . Not from the same people who shared their copies of The New York Times in Peet 's Coffee the morning before . The people up on the mountain are neighbors , first , before they 're hikers or bikers or horseback riders , are n't they ? And what about folks who do n't know the rules-kids on BMX bikes ; commuters from San Francisco ? Weir told me he tore down the hill , ready for a confrontation . The two men were inches apart when Weir removed his helmet and glasses . It was only then that they recognized each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My old soccer coach . " There 's a picture of Weir and the coach and the rest of the team in his high-school yearbook . Everybody 's smiling . Weir put his helmet and glasses back on , and rode away .

The riders get off their hikes and scan the brush for a jagged dirt staircase that drops 300 feet to the pavement below .
