Lucky Girls Stories Chapter One I had often imagined meeting Mrs. Chawla , Arun 's mother . It would be in a restaurant , and I would be wearing a sophisticated blue suit that my mother had sent me soon after I moved to India , and Mrs. Chawla would not be able to keep herself from admiring it . Of course , in those fantasies Arun was always with me . As it happened , Mrs. Chawla appeared early one morning , in a car with a driver , unannounced . I was sitting at the kitchen table in my painting shorts , having a cup of tea . There was no time to straighten up the living room or take a shower . I went into the bedroom , where Arun and I had often slept , and put on a dress  --  wrinkled , but at least it was clean . I put my cup in the sink and set a pot of water on the stove . Then I watched through the window . Mrs. Chawla had got out of the car and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park . The car moved forward , backed up , and then inched forward again . Mrs. Chawla shaded her eyes to look at the backyard : the laundry line with my clothes hanging on it , the grackles perched on the telephone pole , the pile of soft , rotting bricks . I had a feeling that had come to seem familiar in the eight months since Arun had died , a kind of panic that made me want to stand very still . The bell rang . " Hello , Mrs. Chawla , " I said . " I 'm glad you came . " From her handwriting , I had expected someone more imposing . She was several inches shorter than I was , and heavy . Her hair was long and dyed black , with a dramatic white streak in the front ; and she was wearing a navy blue salwar-kameez , the trousers of which were tapered at the ankles , in a style that was just becoming fashionable . " Yes , " she said . " I 've been meaning to . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny smile , as if I were n't what she had expected , either . " Will you have some tea ? " I offered . " Do you have tea ? " she asked , sounding surprised . She looked at the drawn blinds in the living room . There was a crumpled napkin next to the salt and pepper shakers on the table , where I had eaten dinner the night before , and which I had asked Puja , the servant , to clean . Now that it was summer , cockroaches had started coming out of the walls . " Please do n't go to any trouble , " she said . " Puja can do it  --  is she in the kitchen ? " Arun had hired Puja to do my cooking and cleaning ; when he told me she had worked for his mother , I 'd hoped that Mrs. Chawla was making a friendly gesture . In fact , Puja was a terrible housekeeper and a severely limited cook . She lived in a room at the back of the house , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her crouched in the backyard , making chapatis on a pump stove with a low blue flame . Mrs. Chawla walked confidently toward the kitchen , calling Puja in a proprietary voice , and I realized that Arun 's mother had been in my house before . She could have come any number of times , in the afternoons , when I taught art at the primary school or went out shopping in Khan Market . Puja would have let her in without hesitation . When Mrs. Chawla reappeared , she scrutinized the chairs , before choosing to sit on the sofa . She smiled , revealing a narrow space between her teeth . " Where exactly are you from ? " she asked . " My father lives in Boston , but my mother is in California now , " I told her . " Ah , " said Mrs. Chawla softly , as if that explained everything . " An American family . That must make it difficult to decide where to return to . " I had no plans to return , as I should have explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said instead . Mrs. Chawla did n't smile . My brother , I added , was getting married in Boston in July . " And you like the bride ? " she asked . " Oh , " I said . " I only met her once . " I could feel the next question coming , and then a thing happened that often happens to me with people who make me nervous . " What 's her name ? " Mrs. Chawla asked . Her name , which I knew perfectly well , slipped into some temporarily unrecoverable place . " Actually , I do n't remember , " I said . Mrs. Chawla looked at me , puzzled . " How strange , " she said . Puja brought the tea . She knelt on the floor and began placing things , item by item , on the coffee table : spoons , cups , saucers , milk , sugar , and a small plate of Indian sweets that Mrs. Chawla must have brought with her . The tea , it seemed , was no longer my hospitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chawla asked , nodding at Puja . " She 's wonderful , " I lied . Now that Arun was n't here to tell her what to do , the house was getting dirtier and dirtier . Puja 's little girls were watching us from the kitchen doorway . When Mrs. Chawla saw them , she said suddenly , " Girls , " and repeated it sharply in Hindi . " I have told her that if she has another baby "  --  Mrs. Chawla paused and looked at Puja --  " Bas ! Enough , I 'm sending her back to Orissa . " She turned back to me . " That 's east India , " she informed me , as if I had never seen a map of the subcontinent . " The people there are tribals . Did you know that ? Puja is a tribal . These people have nothing , you know , except floods and cyclones . Now they 're having terrible floods  --  have you seen them on television ? Thousands of people are sick , and there is n't enough drinking water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says ? " Puja knew only a few words of English . She seemed to be smiling at her feet , which were bare , extremely small , and decorated with silver toe rings ... Lucky Girls
