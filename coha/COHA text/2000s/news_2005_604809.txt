<p> Here 's the latest holiday fantasy . <p> You make a list of people you have to shop for and what you want to spend  --  and hand it to someone else . <p> You pick a date for a holiday party and list those you want to invite  --  and hand it to someone else . <p> You sketch your house covered in lights , with maybe an inflatable Santa or an 18th-century " village " in the front yard  --  and hand it to someone else . <p> You go on a shopping website and fill in your list and some personality details of the people you 're shopping for , type in your credit card number , hit send and the gifts get sent out . <p> Your " to-do " list becomes someone else 's " to-do " list . <p> In these days of concierge , catering and home-decorating services , you can plan an elaborate holiday for friends and family  --  and let someone else do the work . You can enjoy a totally hands-off holiday . <p> That is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have your tree trimmed to up to $50,000 to emblazon your home with tens of thousands of lights . <p> The idea of letting someone else do holiday planning has been catching on in the past decade as more people have decided they do n't have time to do it themselves , says Pam Danziger of Unity Marketing , which studies luxury retail trends . <p> " What separates the rich from everybody else is their ability to hire people to deal with the day-to-day stuff of life , " Danziger says . " The rest of us can buy things , but they can buy services . " <p> But the rise in time-starved two-income families has pushed the use of such services down the income chain , to folks who hire a restaurant to cook food and drop it off , or a company to hang lights on the roof . <p> That 's meant a boom for businesses that provide those services . Revenue for the catering and party-planning industry will hit about $19 billion in 2005 , according to the National Association of Catering Executives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after restaurants . Americans will spend $8 billion this holiday season on decorations , Danziger says . <p> " People are so wrapped up with work already , " says Norma Barajas , owner of Texas Mexican Restaurant &; Catering in Sacramento . " But they want to enjoy the season , and they want to come to the party "  --  not do the work to throw a party . <p> As a result , more people are hiring out everything about Christmas , says Sara-ann Kasner of the National Concierge Association . " The popularity of concierge services has grown from the image of a privilege for the wealthy to the everyday needs of moms and dads in the workplace , " she says . <p> It 'll look like you did it <p> If you want to have someone else handle your holiday party , you can throw as modest or as elaborate a party as you wish and can afford . <p> " I 've done parties as simple as $5,000 for a sit-down dinner with a cook on-site to the-sky's-the-limit  --  $100,000  --  for a holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service for corporate offices in the Minneapolis-St . Paul area . " We 'll handle everything . The hostess has really done nothing . " <p> You can go downscale and pick up prepared food from your grocery or , for more money , use " drop-off " services of restaurants , caterers and even some hotel chains . They 'll deliver the food in aluminum containers to your front door . <p> " We do a lot of that for customers , " says Darryl Settles , owner of Bob 's Southern Bistro in Boston , which specializes in Cajun and Southern cooking . " Our stuff lends itself to volume cooking . " <p> At the other end of the food chain , you can hire a chef to cook in your home , with waiters or waitresses , china , linens and silverware . Or you can have the caterer put the food in your dishes so everyone thinks you 've cooked it . <p> If you insist on cooking <p> There 's even a trend in which the caterer brings all the ingredients for your menu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For busy working families , though , that might be too much work . <p> " You want it to appear like you 've done it when you have n't done it , " says Gary Abeyta , publisher of Catering Magazine . <p> About 8,300 companies are individually owned firms that do " off-site " catering for homes or businesses , says Kerry Stackpole , executive director of the National Association of Catering Executives . A total of 80,000 companies are in the catering business in some way , from huge corporate caterers to hotels and food-service firms . <p> Industry revenue has rebounded dramatically from the slump after 9/11 . " We 've seen tremendous growth in the number of families who have meals prepared and delivered regularly , " Stackpole says . <p> Christmas Decor of Lubbock , Texas , has grown from seven franchises in 1996 to 375 locations in 48 states this year . A former lawn-maintenance firm , it now has annual revenue of $50 million and serves 40,000 customers . Its services range from simple lighting that costs a couple of hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We 'll do the Clark Griswold thing ; we have some huge displays in New York and Colorado , " says Brandon Stephens of Christmas Decor . He means tens of thousands of lights , like the display Chevy Chase 's character put up in the movie National Lampoon 's Christmas Vacation . When he threw the switch , he blew out all the lights in his neighborhood . <p> It 's known in the business as pulling " a Griswold . " ( When his company does it , Stephens adds , the lights do n't blow . ) <p> The latest trend in outdoor holiday lighting is a move away from the white lights of recent years . <p> " Clear has been king , " Stephens says . But now people are " incorporating color again " by , for example , adding a red bulb for every third white bulb . Nothing too radical . <p> A couple of years ago , strings of icicle lights were the rage . Last year , it was inflatable yard decorations , such as big fat Santas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new this year , and it is n't new , " says Danziger of Unity Marketing . The lack of new pizazz in outdoor decorations means sales wo n't rise much this year , she says . <p> That has n't kept people such as Michael Yang of East Setauket , N.Y. , from spending more than $10,000 to have North Shore Christmas Decor decorate the outside of his home on Long Island . He and his family just emigrated from Taiwan . <p> " This is my first time to have Christmas like this , " he says . " I hope to decorate my house for my family , because even though we have had Christmas , it 's not a Western Christmas ; it 's an Asian Christmas . " <p> Does he think his children will be surprised ? " I hope so . " <p> You can hire an ' elf ' <p> Not everyone wants a cocktail party with carved ice sculptures or chocolate " fountains " to dip strawberries in , while valets park the BMWs on your neighbor 's lawn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Orangeburg , N.Y . They hired Anne McGovern of All Around Town Concierge &; Errand Service to decorate their home for the holidays this year , including the tree , the banister and the dining room tabletop . That 's because John broke his heel after Halloween , just as he was moving his business , and Diane works part time . The couple have three children . <p> " I was getting very overwhelmed , " Diane says . " Everything was falling on me to do . " So she hired the concierge firm after she saw its fliers at her kids ' school . <p> McGovern and a friend , Ginny Hanley , started the firm in September . They charge about $150 an hour to run errands , do shopping and gift wrap , mail Christmas cards , pick up dry cleaning , do grocery shopping and decorate homes around Bergen County , N.J. , and Rockland County , N.Y. , near New York City . <p> And they 're completely booked for the holidays , <p> The personal-shopping trend has grown since the late 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients . Now , there are thousands of local services such as McGovern 's that will do any errands for anyone . The holiday-for-hire industry is busy in the off-season , too . Outdoor lighting contractors do lawn work . Caterers handle weddings and other events . And concierge services work year-round running errands . <p> Getting help online <p> And , of course , personal shopping has grown on the Internet , too . Revenue from shopping online for the holidays is expected to hit $19.4 billion , according to analyst Jeffrey Grau at eMarketer , a retail research firm . While that 's a small slice of total retail sales in November and December , estimated to be $439.5 billion , sales online are rising sharply , up 22% from last year . <p> You can go beyond surfing the Web during work hours to find your holiday gifts . Laura Silsby , CEO of the Personal Shopper website , has taken online shopping one step further . You log on , fill out your gift list , provide some personal details and preferences of the folks you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc.  --  and the software searches millions of products on thousands of websites . <p> Personal Shopper comes up with several ideas . You check the list , pick what you like and connect to the retailer , fill in your credit card number and hit send . The gifts are set for delivery . Then you log off . <p> " Everyone wants to find that perfect gift , but there are so many demands on our time , " says Silsby , whose company is based in Boise . " This takes the stress out of holiday shopping because you do n't have to go on that time-consuming quest through crowded stores . " <p> The appeal of personal shoppers , in person or online , is universal  --  especially for working mothers , says McGovern , who for six months researched what kind of business to start before she opened All Around Town . <p> As the mother of three children and a former party and event planner for Goldman Sachs in Manhattan , she realized she needed help with the daily details of life . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to do for me what I do n't have time to do , " McGovern says . <p> " I need a concierge service !
