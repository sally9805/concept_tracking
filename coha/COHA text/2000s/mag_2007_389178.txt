MUDDY BEASTS , SCARY CLOWNS , AND SPOILED DEER . APRIL 'S COVER featured the line " Why Hogs Are the New Deer " ( " The United States of Hog " by T. Edward Nickens ) . Let me tell you , they are not the new deer . They do n't have antlers , and I ca n't ever see having a strong desire to bring one home and show it off to my wife and kids : " Hey honey , check out the tusks on this muddy beast . " BILL TARMAN , UPPER STRASBURG , PA . We loved seeing your article on hog hunting . My boyfriend and I have been enjoying the sport for years , but last year , Kansas made killing them illegal unless you have a nuisance permit . While I know that hunting does not drastically decrease the number of wild hogs , at least it helps keep the population in check . With all the crops grown in our state , we 'll be overrun with Hogzillas in no time . BARBARA TAYLOR , CARBONDALE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone who hunts with a dogo argentino a mastiff bred to find and catch wild boars . Hunting hogs with dogos is a greater thrill . BRIAN PALMER , SASAKWA , OKLA . EVIL EYE My son is 4 and loves to look at the pictures in FIELD &; STREAM and have the articles read to him . I have never had a problem with the photos being frightening before , so I was shocked when I came across the photo of a hunter in a clown mask holding a gun ( " Dr. Jekyll &; Mr. Eye " by Bill Heavey ) . I know you do n't target small children as your audience , but that was not necessary . LAURA WINN , PARKER , TEXAS Ray Eye certainly has a perverse sense of humor . I wonder how hard he 'd be laughing if that teen with the shotgun had really freaked out and removed his clown and mask with a charge of No. 6 shot . JIM BELLM , CARLINVILLE , ILL . An outdoors without a little incidental weirdness of the occasional out-of-kilter smile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITORS A HERO 'S WELCOME Bravo , Sid Evans , for giving credit where credit is due ( " Model Sportsmen , " Editor 's Letter ) . It seems that we 've moved past supporting public figures who merely pay lip service to gun rights while sponsoring all manner of environmental outrage , and gotten back to conservation in the spirit of Aldo Leopold and the legion of unrecognized heroes who practice conservation across the years and the generations . Thanks for recognizing the efforts of our contemporaries who do such great service for us all . MATTHEW MILTICH , WABANA TOWNSHIP , MINN . RAIN-DEER GAMES " Mr. November " by Bill Heavy ( A Sportsman 's Life ) was great , but then I realized that the deer must have gone to waste . He could n't look for it the next day because of a storm ? Must have been some storm . Do n't tell me the deer was still good either because I wo n't buy it . If this had happened to me , it would have ruined my season , not salvaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavey replies : Sadly , most of the deer did go to waste . There were local tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings on the day in question , most of which I spent using buckets and a wet vac in the basement . I ate some of the meat , and it made me ill rather quickly . CLIP JOBS I must take exception to the remark by David E. Petzal in his review of the new Thompson/Center Icon ( " A Bolt From the Blue , " Rifles ) that detachable magazines are only used by road hunters . If Mr. Petzal chooses to dump his shells in the mud and snow through a hinged floor plate or bolt them out one at a time that 's fine with me , but do n't classify me as a road hunter because I 'm smart enough to see the advantages of a detachable magazine . GALEN BERRIER , LANDISBURG , PA . Detachable magazines make it safer and easier to load and unload your rifle and are more convenient and quieter to carry . I agree with T/C on providing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . FRANK FABIN , EAGAN , MINN . METAL HEAD I think Mr. Nut was confused by the big words in " Ask the Gun Nut " ( Sportsman 's Notebook ) and did n't answer the question . Instead , Petzal rambled on about rust , quality , and gas erosion , which I 'm sure he knows something about . Let 's try again . Does a stainless barrel shoot straighter than a chrome-moly ? DAVE CAMPBELL , EUGENE , ORE . David E. Petzal replies : I was reading the latest edition of Isothermal Transformation Quarterly when I had to interrupt to answer your letter . Are stainless barrels more accurate than chrome-moly ? Sometimes , but not consistently . SIDEBAR THE PASSING OF A SPORTSMAN JOHN G. SAMSON 1922-2007 MAGAZINES , LIKE PEOPLE , AGE . People eventually die , but magazines can be given new life . In 1972 , Jack Samson was made Editor of FIELD &; STREAM , which at that time was badly in need of fresh blood . The publication was dated in outlook , design , and staff . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Samson changed the way the magazine looked and sounded , and built what was  --  and is  --  the finest assemblage of writers to work on one outdoors title . He inherited Ed Zern and Ted True-blood , and added George Reiger , Bob Brister , Gene Hill , Bill Tarrant , Norm Strung , and a promising young ex-newspaperman named Keith McCafferty . Samson had been a bomber navigator in China during World War II , and after that a newspaper reporter , an outdoors writer , and a Nieman Fellow at Harvard . He was an all-around sportsman who especially loved flyfishing , and in particular , saltwater flyfishing . As an editor , he never ducked a fight and probably picked more than his share . In an elk hunting story he wrote for F &S; in the 1970s , Samson described a conversation he had about dying . When asked if it had any terrors fro him , he answered no , because he had lots of friends on the other side . He did , and he 's with them now .
