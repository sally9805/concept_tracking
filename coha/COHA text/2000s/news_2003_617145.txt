<p> " The Drawer Boy , " a Canadian comedy about two bachelors and a guest who wo n't leave their farm , is the most popular play in American theater this season . <p> You can see it at Horizon Theatre beginning April 2 . <p> " Proof , " the award-winning puzzle play about family dynamics , math and madness , ranks second . It was perhaps the biggest hit last year in Artistic Director Susan V. Booth 's inaugural season at the Alliance Theatre . <p> American Theatre magazine , which counts these things , lists 27 shows on its annual tally of the most-produced plays in the country . Metro theatergoers have seen  --  or can still see  --  15 of those . A dozen on the list have yet to be touched here , including works by Pulitzer Prize winners Edward Albee and Suzan-Lori Parks . <p> " The good news is that you can see the same type of regional work here that you can see at any regional center in the country , " says 7 Stages Managing Director Raye Varney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community since 1985 . " That speaks very well of Atlanta . That means we 're sort of ahead of the curve . " <p> To date , metro theatergoers have seen , from the list , Noel Coward 's " Private Lives , " David Sedaris ' " Santaland Diaries , " " Stones in His Pockets , " " Spitfire Grill " ( at two theaters ) , " A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum , " " Bat Boy ! The Musical ! , " " Fully Committed , " " Copenhagen " and " The Laramie Project . " <p> Still to come this season are " Blue/Orange " ( at Actor 's Express in January ) , " Forum " ( back at the Shakespeare Tavern in May ) , " My Fair Lady " ( at the Alliance in January ) and two of five " Waiting for Godots " being staged nationally in this , its 50th-anniversary year ( at Theatrical Outfit in January and 7 Stages in March ) . <p> The types of plays making the list are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I think everybody 's trying to look for stories that tell bigger stories than what a lot of our playwrights have been writing in the past , " says Minadakis , who , in his first season , sees the Express as a place to promote young American playwrights . <p> " Everybody 's getting away from the living-room play , " he says . " The stories are all getting a little bit more mythological . There 's a lot more symbolism than I think you would have seen had you looked at this list 10 years ago , or even five years ago . <p> " There 's also the trend that 's been developing since 9/11 that we all figured would happen . The subject matter is getting darker and darker and darker . " <p> He 's talking about plays like " Topdog/Underdog , " in which two brothers scrap for superiority , or " Yellowman , " in which a black couple is torn apart by intraracial prejudice , or even " Blue/Orange , " an indictment of the mental health system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one without courage or challenge , " says Ben Cameron , executive director of the Theatre Communications Group , which publishes American Theatre magazine . <p> It is also one in which economics may be the biggest player of all . <p> " Money , " says Lisa Adler , co-founder and artistic director of Horizon Theatre , " is never no object . " <p> So whether it 's " The Drawer Boy " or " Blue/Orange " or " Waiting for Godot " that gets produced here this season , artistic directors are choosing plays that meet one or all of these criteria : <p> * Small cast size . <p> * Name recognition via the playwright ( Coward ) or the play itself ( " My Fair Lady " ) . <p> * Some seal of approval  --  an award or critical acclaim in New York or London . <p> * Something most audiences wo n't find offensive . <p> The Horizon 's Adler worries not about the quality of plays on the list but about the quality of plays left off it and " the limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I see that list , I try to find out why what 's on it is on it , " Adler says . " ' Drawer Boy ' is on there because it 's a good play with a very accessible story , well-written , a great ensemble piece for three actors , and it does n't offend anybody . <p> " Believe it or not , that 's a rarity in American professional theater . Most contemporary writers are writing things that do n't fall into that mode . Either they are experimenting with more nonrealism than most audiences can deal with or they are putting things in that New York audiences can deal with , but audiences outside of New York will not . People have to decide to buy a ticket . " <p> Albee 's " The Goat , or Who Is Sylvia ? " deals with bestiality , for example . And while Parks ' " Topdog/Underdog " is considered her most accessible work , it is in-your-face and full of language many audiences might find offensive . Neither play will be produced in Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been or will be and , fortunately , being popular or having a small cast does n't mean a play ca n't be quality theater . <p> " It 's a happy coincidence that plays as good as ' Proof ' or ' Topdog ' also have small casts , " says the Alliance 's Booth . " But ' Take Me Out ' the 2003 Tony Award winner for best play does n't have a small cast . And it 's a fantastic piece of writing with a proven Broadway track record . Will it show up on next season 's 10 most-produced-plays list ? Will large-cast classics like ' Skin of Our Teeth ' and ' Member of the Wedding ' show up ? Less likely . <p> " Every year I think about producing ' Ballad of the Sad Cafe , ' " Booth adds , " but it has 26 people in it . And this past year I thought about producing a new work from Howard Korder  --  one of the American masters , for my money  --  but it had over 30 . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-even-yet-penned adaptation of the Oedipus stories . . . . I did n't even finish counting on that one . " <p> Cast size is n't the only factor that determines whether a particular play is in or out , artistic directors say , but it 's a big one . The others come down to a judgment call . <p> Adler wanted to do " Blue Serge " by Rebecca Gilman this season but thought its sexual content was too risky ( Horizon did do Gilman 's sexually tense " Boy Gets Girl " in 2002 ; the Alliance did her racially themed " Spinning Into Butter " the year before ) . Adler says Horizon audiences may very well see " Blue Serge " next season . <p> She also likes Martin McDonagh 's " Lieutenant of Inishmore , " but Horizon does n't have the ability to blow up people and things onstage , which the play requires . <p> Dad 's Garage Artistic Director Sean Daniels predicts that " Crowns " ( cast size six ) , which recently finished a successful run at the Alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes the fact that Atlanta theaters seem ahead of or right in step with regional trends , when three or four years ago it was several steps behind . <p> But ever-shrinking cast sizes worry him . " Bat Boy ! The Musical ! , " which proved so popular that the improv and youth-bent Dad 's extended its run last summer , was done with nine actors instead of the 11 called for , in order to save a few bucks . <p> " When suddenly that 's the giant show among the mix , it 's something to take notice of , " Daniels says . <p> Dad 's likes to work with the young playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa ( " Say You Love Satan , " " Weird Comic Book Fantasy " ) , whose plays require more than the two or three characters so in favor these days . <p> " He likes to write large shows , " Daniels says . <p> " Would ' Angels in America '  --  either of them  --  get produced if we were looking for one- or two-character shows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sacrificing while we 're looking for one or two guys and a piano ?
