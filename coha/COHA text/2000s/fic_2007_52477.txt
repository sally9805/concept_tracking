ON HIS WAY OVER TO THE UNIVERSITY , Jake turns back to ask her : " You 'll remember to get the Thule put on top of the Volvo ? And make sure the key works ? " He hands her this little bitty key . " Sure , " Nova says , rubbing her eyes , wearing a black #3 muscle shirt that used to be her brother 's , and nothing else . She knows she can get Theron to do it . " The drug boys are coming today , " she says , and Jake nods . He is on the board of Agape , the residential drug treatment program that runs the landscaping and lawn-care business that visits their little farm outside Charlottesville , which is not really a farm any more than they are really farmers , or Jake is an average graduate student , or they are a regular young couple just trying to make ends meet . No . The big surprise is that Jake turned out to belong to a very rich family , rich enough to own an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are heading tomorrow morning at the crack of dawn in the Volvo with the Thule on top of it like an enormous coffin filled with their clothes because the dogs will be taking up all the space in the car-Thor , Jake 's old black lab , in the backseat , and Odin , the big husky pup , in the back-back . Everybody in Jake 's family owns big dogs , which wear bandanas and go to Maine . Nova has been there once , last year , when she and Jake had just gotten married . Everybody in Jake 's family called her " The Bride " in a tongue-in-cheek way , which made her nervous at first , until she figured out that 's just how they all talk , like they are putting quotation marks around everything . Nova recognizes irony , which is what Mrs. Stevenson , her senior English teacher , defined as , " when the fire chief 's house burns down . " Part of the irony in calling her " The Bride " came from the fact that Nova was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , this is great , this is awesome , this is seriously great , " Jake 's brother had assured her in Maine . " We always figured he was gay . " Now Jake blows her a kiss from the yard before he drives off in his old truck . Nova has never known a man before who would blow anybody a kiss , ever , under any circumstances . She rubs her flat stomach , fingering the navel ring . Jake took pictures of her pregnancy , every few days . He used rolls and rolls of film . She lost the baby at five and a half months , and it was a girl , they said . Nova had wanted a girl ; she would have taken such good care of it , not like her own mother at all . Nova and Jake had already bought a crib and gotten Agape to paint the extra bedroom tangerine , her idea . Nova has plenty of ideas ; she is not dumb at all . Jake has made her realize this . Now they have closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good thing they 've got these two dogs , which keep her busy , sort of . Nova likes the dogs , but she did not like Maine , an entire state that smells like Pine-Sol , especially Blueberry Island , a very cold and foggy place that is far away from everything , especially the grocery store . Nova does like to cook , and it drove her crazy not to be able to go to the grocery store every day , which is what she likes to do at home . Also , the water will freeze your ass off , and the grocery store does not even carry grits . And there is no TV on Blueberry Island , a thing which Jake forgot to mention in all the times he told her about Blueberry Island like it was paradise . The only positive thing was that all the Maine women turned out to be big and ugly , almost as if they were doing it on purpose , so this made Nova look like a beauty queen . Nobody wore any makeup or nice clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful . This was also true of Jakes mother and sisters , at least in the summertime . Nova does not know if they look any better during the rest of the year or not . She and Jake did not go up to Connecticut for Christmas , although they were invited , because this is when Nova lost the baby and had to spend several days in the University of Virginia Hospital , very ironic considering that is where she and Jake first met , though Jake was over in Neurosciences and she was working the cash register in the snack bar on the first floor . Jake had been in the hospital for three months when she met him ; this is why he had a blue badge and was allowed to come down to the first floor unsupervised . Later he would get a town pass , and still later a day pass , which would allow him to take her to the Boars Head Inn and fuck her eyes out . Yes ! His brothers would have been so surprised . Nova had never been to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlottesville all her life . Their room had a 6o-inch TV hidden away inside an antique hutch , she was so surprised . Also a minibar . Nova had noticed Jake right away because he was so thin . Most of the mental patients are real fat , due to their medications . Jake was also sweet not usually true of doctors or patients , either one . The day they met , he was standing patiently in line behind that heavy woman with the big blond hairdo growing out black at the roots who was so pushy and bought the same thing every day , a cheeseburger and fries and strawberry shortcake , and had a fit whenever they did n't have the strawberry shortcake . That day she forgot her money . When Nova handed her the little piece of paper , she started to cry . The woman had a black moustache , which drove Nova crazy . Nova has sort of an obsession about facial hair . Maybe she should slip this woman some Nair . " Just go on , " Nova told her , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh no-I- " The woman began to flap her hands . " Here . Keep the change , " Jake said , popping up behind the woman , handing over a ten-dollar bill . " I 'm not allowed to do that , " Nova said , as the woman started to cry . " Just add my bill onto hers , then , " Jake said . The woman cried louder , big sobs coming up out of her cleavage . " Here now , ma'am . " He took the woman by the elbow and steered her over to a table , pulling out a chair for her . Nova rang up the woman 's food again , along with a coffee and three little bowls of macaroni and cheese . " That 's not a very balanced meal , " she said to him when he came back . " Well . " Jake grinned at her . " I 'm not a very balanced man . I 'm crazy . " " What 's your diagnosis ? " Nova knew she was n't supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's your name ? " " Nova , " she said . " Named for the car , not the star . My mother got pregnant at a drive-in . " Nova thought he looked like one of those cornhusk dolls her granny used to make , with thin , thin corn silk hair flopping onto his face and a long thin stick nose and big even teeth like a row of corn on the cob and beautiful huge blue eyes like lakes , swimming behind his thick glasses . Or she was swimming in his eyes ; that 's more like it . Suddenly Nova became very critical of Haywood Irons , who had given her this job for certain considerations ; he had steel blue jaws by five o'clock and lived for Monday Night Football . " You do n't seem very crazy to me , " Nova heard herself say , though really he was so thin and pale , he was not her type at all . " I guess you 'll have to get to know me then , " Jake said , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy to her , only too sensitive for this world . Jake used to be a rock musician and play in bands , she learned , but now he was a graduate student in American studies . He used to do a lot of drugs , but now he does oral histories with people such as lobster fishermen in Maine and the drug boys who work for Agape . He has already taped Theron . The first time Nova went up to visit Jake in the third floor dayroom in Neurosciences , a skinny blond woman came over and hugged him and turned to Nova and told her , " You may not know it , but this is Jesus Christ . " " Wow , " Nova said . " All the girls say that , " Jake said . Jake played " Pachelbel 's Canon " and " Bridge over Troubled Water " for Nova on the piano they had brought into the dayroom for him . Nova started to visit him every afternoon when she got off lunch duty , and one time when she was up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the piano and started scat-singing along when fake was playing blues . " I was born down in Savannah " he sang , " under a ugly star . " Nurses and aides and other patients gathered around to hear him ; this little man had not said a single word since he had been admitted to the hospital months before . Nobody knew who he was or where he had come from or anything of his history . They wrote it down as he sang it , accompanied by Jake . When Jake got out of the hospital , Nova moved out to his crazy house in the country with him . Haywood Irons was mad at her now , so she could n't afford her apartment anymore ; but she did n't tell Jake that , and it did n't matter anyway , because by then she was pregnant . " Honey , if I was you I 'd make a good thing of this , " Novas mother said , smoking a cigarette , when Nova went to ask her for money at the dry cleaners where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " Of course Nova 's mother did n't have any money anyway . And really , Jake was so happy when she told him , and so sweet , he was putty in Nova 's hands . She told him she did n't believe in abortion . They got married at the big courthouse downtown . Nova wore a beautiful midcalf flowered dress with a low lacy neckline , while Jake wore some old army pants and a tux jacket . By then she was catching on to how rich people will wear just any old thing . The witnesses at their wedding were a courthouse secretary named Alice Robinson and a prostitute named Shawndra Day who had been sitting out in the hall waiting to see her court-appointed attorney . Then Jake took Nova down to Richmond for a night in the Jefferson Hotel , with its crocodile sculpture and its great dome of stained glass in the lobby like a cathedral , the closest Nova has ever been to one . When they got back to Charlottesville , there was his mother , leaning up against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy blue Mercedes with smoked windows ; you could n't tell if she had a driver or anybody else in there with her or not . Jake 's mother has dyed red hair and anorexia nervosa even at her age , Nova could tell right off . She recognizes a mental illness when she sees one . Jake 's mother 's name is Rose . Jake got out of the car and Rose ran over to fling her arms around him dramatically , like a person in a movie . " I ca n't believe you would do this to me , " she sobbed . Jake patted her while extricating himself as best he could , motioning for Nova to get out of the Volvo . " Rose , " he said , " here she is . This is Nova . " But Rose cut loose again and would not even look at her . Well fuck this , Nova thought , standing there . Then the driver 's side door of the blue Mercedes opened and Jake 's father got out , a horsey-looking man in khaki pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took both of Nova 's hands in his , looking into her eyes in a way that made Nova trust him immediately as well as feel sort of bad about herself . " Welcome to the family , dear , " he said . " Wo n't you come in ? " Nova said . " No , " said Rose . " Sure , " said Mr. Valentine . They had ginger ale and stale cookies and strained conversation , with Rose sniffling on the old truck seat that served as a sofa , looking all around the crazy living room . " FoUc art " Jake explained , as his mother took in the old signs and homemade art on the walls and the chainsaw angel and the barber 's chair that Mr. Valentine was sitting in . Nova went along with Rose on this . She could not understand why anybody would n't have nice comfortable furniture if they could afford it . She hates that chainsaw angel . Nova said she was n't feeling well and excused herself . So they did n't know that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left , that she saw Mr. Valentine poke Jake in the side and say , " Way to go ! " as Jake turned to leave , or that she heard Rose say , " I do n't like her " when he was out of earshot . " At least he 's not gay , " Mr. Valentine said , as he got in the car . Now Jake 's parents are already in Maine , on the island , with a cook and a housekeeper and a " man " who live in little log cabins out in the piney woods and do everything for them . Nova stands at the screen door and thinks about everything she has got to do to get ready for the trip , besides getting Theron and his boys to put the Thule on top of the Volvo-that 's the least of it . Nova does not see why she ca n't have decent help instead of drug addicts and crazy people , why they ca n't have a nice house , why they have to go back to the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't understand why they have to go to Maine instead of Hilton Head Island , which is where anybody in their right mind who could afford it would surely go . But now Nova has got to clean out the refrigerator and wash a load of clothes and go in to town to buy more dog food and sign that little thing in the Post Office that will cancel their mail delivery while they are gone , though she never gets any mail anyway except stuff from the community college now that Jake has signed her up to take some courses in the fall . She has got to read The Scarlet Letter first , which looks awful . Mrs. Stevenson used to want her to go to college , too , but then Nova ran off with her mother 's boyfriend 's brother , a disc jockey from Columbia , ending up in Myrtle Beach doing some things that did not require a degree of any kind . Nova runs her finger along the screen door ; she knows she 's procrastinating . Actually , " procrastinating " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so well on . Then beyond the mailbox and the meadow she sees a rising plume of dust , so she runs back into their bedroom and pulls on some cutoffs and puts on that red halter top and some red lipstick and ties her hair into a high swingy ponytail on top of her head . She 's back at the screen door by the time Theron jumps out of his jeep , looking like an ad for something . Anything ! Theron has gray eyes and the most beautiful legs and a caf au lait complexion . He says he is Hawaiian , but Nova knows he is not . Theron stands for a minute outside the door , peering in . " Where is everybody ? " Nova asks , meaning the rest of the Agape yard crew . " Taco Bell . " Theron unbuttons his shirt . Nova is naked by the time they hit the bedroom . Afterward , they share a joint in the unmade bed . Since hiring Agape , Nova has had them clear the meadow and make a stone path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake uses for his photography studio . Now she has just decided to make a rock garden out front , on the side of that little hill by the mailbox . It will be a lot of work . Nova smiles , lying flat on her back with her feet up against the wall . " What you call that thing you want me to put on the car ? " Theron is already up , pulling on his pants . " Thule , " she says . " Funny name . " Theron sits back down on the side of the bed to lace up his work boots . " I thought it was a brand name , but Jake says it means some mythical northern country , " Nova says dreamily in that dreamy way she always feels after sex , thinking Thule , Yule , Thor , Odin , all of these words that Theron does not and will never know . Thule . It sounds like a kingdom of the olden days . Still , he 's gorgeous , those big brown arms . " Hey babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her , pinches her nipple . " What ? " It 's hot in the bedroom . A bee buzzes against the screen . " Well , I been thinking . " Now he seems hesitant , for Theron . Usually Theron is right up-front . " You know , it would n't be too hard for you and me to , you know , do something about Jake . If that 's what you wanted me to do , I mean . " Suddenly the whole room goes completely still , like it has turned into a blackand-white photograph . The air gets thick and hard to breathe . Nova sits up . " What did you say ? " she asks . " You and me , we could , you know . " Theron grins at her . She looks out the window and down the meadow to the road where she sees the dust , which means that the Agape boys are coming up the hill in that old panel truck . " Hey now , you know , I did n't mean nothing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go , smiling at her . Nova smiles back . " Well , that 's good , then . " Maybe that rock garden is not such a good idea , she thinks later , watching Theron lift the Thule like it 's nothing . He and his boys attach it securely to the racks on the top of the Volvo . Then they start up their regular mowing and weed eating like crazy . Nova knows they do a lot of unnecessary work out here because they need the money . She does n't blame them a bit . While they work , she cleans out the refrigerator and finishes the wash and packs her own suitcase , but she knows she ca n't leave the farm until Agape leaves first because they will steal something . Of course they will . And why not ? They are the underclass , a word she learned last week when she went over to the university with Jake for the opening of that photography exhibit he 's in , " The Mind 's Eye . " The next morning Nova has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He forgot to give her the clothes he wanted her to wash ; he forgot to pick up his medicine from the pharmacy and the dogs " heartworm pills from the vet , so she has to drive into town to get all this stuff . When she gets back the clothes are dry . They fold them together , and then she climbs up on the step stool and puts them into the Thule as Jake hands them up to her , one item after another in the blazing midday sun , then his tennis racket and his wet suit and all the books and equipment he will need for his various projects-his tripod , his printer , his tape recorder , whatever . Jake makes a huge production about packing everything just so . Nova feels like hitting him , but instead she smiles brightly and asks , " Ready ? " and Jake reaches up to hug her and says yes , he guesses so . He whistles for the dogs , who have been circling the Volvo warily , like fish . He puts Thor into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will ride behind the pet gate next to Nova 's suitcase . Odin jumps in . Jake slams the door . " OK , lock it , " he calls up to Nova , who is getting this god-awful headache now up on this step stool so close to the sun . She sticks the little key into the little lock and tries to turn it , but it wo n't turn . Shit . That 's the one thing she forgot to do yesterday , check the goddamn key . But what is she supposed to be anyway , a goddamn hired hand ? She 'll have to tell him , though , wo n't she ? Wo n't she ? Wo n't they have to go get some bungee cords or something ? Nova turns , shielding her eyes from the sun , but now Jake has disappeared back into the house . He comes out waving The Scarlet Letter . " Hey ! You almost forgot this ! " he yells . He tosses it into the front seat . Right . Like Nova is really going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She 's not a hired hand ; she 's a project . For the second time that day Nova has the sense that time has stopped , that she is in one of Jake 's photographs . She looks out at the rolling meadow and the little stone farmhouse and the blue line of mountains beyond , where she grew up . She jumps down lightly . When Jake hugs her , she can feel all his ribs . " Ready ? " he says . She gets in the car . They are on Interstate 81 outside of Chambersburg , Pennsylvania , when the top of the Thule pops up and Jake 's clothes start flying out , slowly at first , like something in a dream , scattering all over the interstate behind them . Strangely enough , Nova sees the whole thing , entirely by chance , because she has pulled the passenger side mirror down to tweeze her face a little bit , those chin hairs . So she just happens to see Jake 's red and black checkered L.L. Bean wool shirt out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to land on the windshield of a red Chevy Blazer two cars behind them , blinding the driver only momentarily but long enough to make her swerve back and forth , back and forth , in larger and larger arcs , the Blazer rocking now until it runs off the road into the median hitting one of those great big rocks like you find in Pennsylvania . Nova puts the tweezers back into her makeup case , which she puts back into her purse . She does n't say one word to Jake , but turns in her seat to watch as his clothes fly through the air faster and faster and all the cars behind them begin to weave , and then there 's a rattling sound from the top of the Volvo as his printer busts loose to land squarely on the hood of the Subaru wagon just behind them , and his tennis racket bounces off the hood of the little yellow Acura , breaking the window and causing the Acura to veer into a silver pickup in the other lane , which hits a Jeep Cherokee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other now , out of their nice white lines , crumpling like toy cars . Smoke rises into the sunny air . The dogs start barking . The Cherokee is burning . Now a Mustang convertible is burning , too . Nova knows this is all her fault . " Oh no ! Oh my God ! Oh shit ! " Now Jake sees it , too ; he drives right off the road . They are bumping along over big old rocks , and then they are in the trees . Nova never , ever told . She left Jake , who really was too sensitive for this world . She heard he 's been dead for a couple of years now . That day on I-8i has come to seem like a film to her-a DVD that she can play at will in her mind 's eye , slow or fast-more vivid than anything else in her life before or since . Nova has never made a good thing out of anything , but she 's done all right . She gets along OK . They never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nova has never gotten there since . She thinks about it sometimes , though , and it seems so far away to her now , like another country , the country of Thule perhaps , with its piney smell and its pointed trees and the freezing water in Blueberry Lake , and they are all still there , Jake 's whole family and all their dogs and Jake himself , she can still see his swimming blue eyes right now .
