<p> A little over a year ago , this town was a veritable bee 's nest of renovation . Turkish engineers were building a major highway to link Kabul and Kandahar . Afghan demining agencies were probing the earth for land mines lurking on footpaths and in wheat fields . <p> And then , in August , the attacks started . Just down the road in Ghazni , a Turkish engineer was kidnapped by Taliban fighters and held for ransom . Here in Salar , hoodlums fired rockets on a demining vehicle and stole another . In a matter of weeks , a handful of troublemakers had turned one of Afghanistan 's few success stories into a scene of lawlessness . <p> And it never would have happened that way , says Malik Abdul Khaliq , the local tribal leader here , if the Afghan government had only asked for his help and for the tribe 's protection . <p> " The road-project people did n't talk with us at all . They only talked with people who had money or power or guns , " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dominates this town . " If they had listened to tribal leaders , and asked for our assistance , this violence would never have happened . The US and President Hamid Karzai now realize that without the support of the tribes , they ca n't do any development in this country . " <p> Two and a half years after the fall of the Taliban , the fight for control of Afghanistan continues tribe by tribe and village by village . It 's a battle of hearts and minds , where the enemy - Taliban and Al Qaeda - know the rules and nuances of tribal society better than the Americans , and perhaps better than some of the urbanized Afghan officials who now rule the country . <p> It 's a battle where alliances are made and broken over blood relationships and tribal feuds , rather than adherence to an extremist form of Islam preached by Osama bin Laden . The fluid power struggles present an opportunity for the US to cast its lot with tribal leaders to get intelligence and secure local protection for reconstruction projects . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining the country 's transition to a more modern , democratic system based on merit rather than blood . <p> " Tribes are arguably more important than ever , " says David Edwards , an anthropologist with extensive experience in Afghanistan based at Williams College in Massachusetts . " Given the fact that the present administration neither is very strong nor has a great deal of legitimacy , tribal structures have rebounded . " <p> For centuries , it was tribal leaders rather than kings who truly ruled Afghanistan . The Emir of Kabul could pass edicts and demand taxes , but outside Kabul , his power was largely ceremonial . Out in the remoter desert oases , tribes ruled themselves . <p> Given this tradition of rugged individualism , Afghan intelligence sources and government officials say it is no accident that the bulk of attacks against US and Afghan forces , and against Afghan and international aid workers , is occurring in the southern parts of Afghanistan . It is here that the Afghan tribes - especially those of Afghanistan 's largest ethno- linguistic group , the Pashtuns - remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban leadership along the Afghan-Pakistani border shows that their power is based at least as much on their tribal relationships as on their religious credentials ( see map ) . <p> One former CIA case officer , who worked with Afghan fighters during the anti-Soviet jihad of the 1980s , says the Taliban have degenerated from a religious movement into a tribal cabal . <p> " They are tribal chiefs , who give themselves Islamist credentials for foreign consumption , but the real source of their power is their tribe , " says the CIA officer . " Their power does not extend beyond the influence of their tribe . " <p> Tribal structure <p> Most Pashtuns are divided into two major tribes , the Ghalji and the Durrani . The Ghalji are larger in number , but the Durrani have long been dominant . Mr. Karzai is a Durrani . <p> In parts outside Afghanistan 's Pashtun-dominated south , tribal identity takes a backseat to broader ethnic , sectarian , and regional affiliations which form the backbone of support for many of the country 's powerful warlords . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power is much less concentrated . Within the two larger tribes there are numerous sub-tribes , conflicting claims to leadership , and small-scale militias . Each village has a tribal chief , and these chiefs choose from among their own ranks leaders who will represent the tribe in Kabul . Most tribes , however , have a number of factions claiming to represent the whole tribe , leading to rivalries and chaos . While the multilayered and fractious nature of tribal authority can be exploited by outsiders , those same traits make it a perilously complex game . <p> Motivations , however , are not hard to discern . If a tribal chief is n't seen as an adequate provider for the tribe , he risks being overthrown by rivals . <p> Survival instincts <p> For a tribal chief , the " primary goal is simply to stay in power , both for reputation and his ability to squeeze money out of his position , " says the CIA officer . " So he will resist central intrusion if he does not benefit , but will welcome it if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For coalition forces - and in particular the new Provincial Reconstruction Teams run by US Army civil affairs units - this presents an opportunity to drive a wedge between different Taliban groups , based on their tribal affiliations . Aid that makes life better for one tribe - or one faction within a tribe - will inevitably incite the passions of traditional rivals , regardless of their ideological common ground . <p> And Afghan intelligence and military officials say they are making progress , using close relatives and rivals of Taliban leaders to kill or capture them . <p> " You have to remember that the Pashto word for cousin is the same word as enemy , " says Samiullah Qatra , commander of the new Afghan Border Police . " You might have noticed that most of the problems in Afghanistan emanate from tribal rivalries and monetary gains . " <p> Last month , Afghan military officials crowed over the successful capture of Mullah Rozi Khan , a Taliban commander and Ghalji tribe member from the southwestern province of Zabul . Mullah Khan was thought to be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , particularly around the town of Shahjoy . Afghan intelligence officials confirm that the capture of Khan was the result of careful surveillance carried out by members of his own tribe . <p> " If you give money to somebody in a tribe , you can get information ; that is the main source of intelligence in Afghanistan , " says a senior Afghan intelligence officer . " The information we get is from cousins , uncles , relatives . The first thing is trust , and for that you turn to your family . But the second thing is always there : money . " <p> Yet American efforts to work with the tribal system have been spotty at best , US officials and academics say . The biggest hindrance is the practice of cycling American diplomats and soldiers in and out of Afghanistan on one-year assignments . Many US intelligence officers serve even less time . This makes it difficult for American diplomats - most of whom are already restricted to the heavily fortified US embassy - to establish the personal bonds of trust necessary in a tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribal relations a long time ago , " says Thomas Barfield , a sociologist at Boston University with extensive experience in Afghanistan . " They also learned the importance of keeping people on the ground for long periods of time as political agents so they could learn the system and try to manipulate it . " <p> Mr. Barfield notes that the US " system of rewards focuses on the individual - characteristic of our culture - in a land where you need to involve the community . Thus , the people who shelter Osama may be unlikely to give him up , but their rivals might be happy to , not just for the reward but because of the embarrassment it would cause the next valley . " <p> A danger in meddling <p> While UN officials and humanitarian groups say that involving tribal leaders is crucial to securing peace in Afghanistan , they caution against using tribal rivalries for military gains . " The last thing they want to do is create tribal animosities , " the UN official says . <p> Already many of the attacks on aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the Taliban . Aid agencies new to the region sometimes initiate projects without consulting tribal elders about their priorities . Some of these projects are later sabotaged , and blamed on Taliban forces , although UN officials say they suspect the elders may have organized the attacks themselves to avenge the slight . <p> With the central government unable to provide security , many tribes are starting to look after themselves . The Mangal tribe of Khost Province , for instance , has formed its own tribal militia , called an arbakai . During a recent day of voting registration in Tapia village , the local arbakai - four teenagers with Kalashnikovs - protected the village voter registration site - a local gas station . <p> " We are a strong tribe because we obey our elders , " says Musa Khan , an 18-year-old with a gift for gab . He looks at the two truckloads of provincial soldiers sent to protect reporters on a trip toward the border . " We do n't need soldiers like those , we protect ourselves . " <p> ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @
