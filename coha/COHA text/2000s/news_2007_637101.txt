<p> Phoenix  --  This city was already a metropolis a thousand years ago . An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Hohokam people made this area one of the major population centers in North America in 1100 . <p> At first glance , today 's Phoenix gives no hint of its past . Visitors see skyscrapers , suburbs , golf courses and shops , but the city 's history lies  --  literally  --  just under the surface . <p> We found ourselves fascinated by Phoenix 's early history . From the desert itself through the Hohokam civilization to more recent native tribes to the frontier era , Phoenix offers much to see and do . <p> Desert Botanical Garden <p> As with any city , history begins with the land . Phoenix lies in the Sonoran Desert , which stretches southward into Mexico . The Salt River bisects the city . Around and in Phoenix , mountains of schist , mineral-rich metamophoric rocks , rise up from the desert looking like huge sharp rocks scattered by a giant . <p> The Desert Botanical Garden , in Papago Park , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world . The 0.3-mile Sonoran Desert trail , though , brings the desert up close . Sturdy-armed saguaro , which symbolize the Southwestern desert for many of us , are scattered throughout the landscape . <p> " The saguaro is my favorite cactus , " Ed Jones , a volunteer guide at the garden , said . " It only grows in the Sonoran Desert . It does n't flower until it 's past 30 years old , then grows its first arm at about 70 and can live to be as old as 200 . " <p> When it rains , the saguaro can quickly grow more roots to absorb as much water as possible . The " ribs " of dead saguaro have provided sturdy wooden supports for houses and fences since prehistoric times . <p> On the Sonoran Desert Trail are also interactive displays of Indian life . We pounded tough mesquite seeds into flour , wove agave fibers into twine and visited an Apache wickiup dwelling . Although the day was cool , the prickly pear cactus iced tea at the Garden Cafe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Pueblo Grande Museum and Archaeological Park , wedged between the airport and the river . Beginning before 450 , the Hohokam used sticks and stone tools to dig irrigation canals here . Beside the Salt River they grew corn , beans and other crops . Over the years they prospered , building ever more complex dwellings and intricate canal systems . The villages grew until they covered a 10-mile area . But , like so many other pre-European cultures , the Hohokam disappeared by 1500 , leaving their villages to weather back into the earth . <p> Pima Indians are thought to be descendants of the Hohokam , and their legends mention arrogant rulers and fierce battles . Some archaeologists think massive floods may have destroyed the canal system . Others cite the disappearance of the Anasazi in the same century and wonder if drought played a role . The mystery remains . <p> Pueblo Grande Museum has a short video about the site and displays of pottery , baskets , tools and other items recovered or reconstructed . Outside , we hiked a 0.6-mile trail around the outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the smooth-dirt ball court . <p> The Heard Museum <p> In what was the mainland United States ' last frontier , fighting between settlers and Indians persisted in the Southwest until 1886 . It was n't until 1912 that Arizona became the 48th state . The Heard family moved to Phoenix during this territorial era and began collecting Indian artifacts . They opened the Heard Museum in 1929 . Since then the collection has expanded to 39,000 pieces , shown in three locations . <p> We visited the original building in downtown Phoenix , seeing pottery , kachina dolls , baskets and complete scenes from traditional Indian life . On the museum grounds are statues of and by Native Americans . Some of the statues are for sale , while the museum gift shop offers a wealth of books , fine art , woven rugs and jewelry.One fascinating exhibit , " Remembering Our Indian School Days , " gives first-person accounts by Native Americans who , as children , were sent to government-sponsored boarding schools to become " civilized . " The first Bureau of Indian Affairs school , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the next four generations , boarding school was forced on children as young as 5 . Some children welcomed the opportunity to study English , but others were miserable . Most children were abruptly taken from their parents  --  sometimes by uniformed soldiers  --  and put onto trains to go to the faraway schools . They were n't allowed to return home for years , until their education was deemed complete . <p> Other displays show how Arizona 's 21 federally recognized tribes have gained much in the past 45 years . They 've managed to retain water and other rights in the courts . Some have opened casinos , providing much-needed income . Others have won back some of their ancestral lands . Most are working to find a balance between keeping their traditions and living in the modern world of cellphones and computers . <p> Deer Valley Rock Art Center <p> When a dam was being constructed in 1970 just north of Phoenix , engineers found several basalt rocks with ancient carvings on them . These carvings , made by chipping one rock with another rock , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks covered with petroglyphs of spirals , deer , people , snakes and other designs . A survey found more than 1,500 petroglyphs , so they were protected when the dam was built . <p> Today at Deer Valley Rock Art Center , some of these petroglyphs , possibly as old as 10,000 years , can be seen from the easy quarter-mile trail . <p> One of the center 's guides is Desert Little Bear Gonzales , a Native American of Yaqui and Apache descent . Gonzales explained that anthropologists argue about how old the carvings are and what each design could mean , but for him this is not as important as remembering the people . <p> " Except for technology , " he said , " the people who carved these were just like us . They loved their children . They worked for food . They worried about the same things we worry about . " <p> Sears-Kay Ruin <p> Continuing with our exploration of Phoenix 's roots , we hiked a rocky trail to see the Sears-Kay Ruin . The stone outlines of ancient homes lie among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around . It is believed the Hohokam people built here late in their era , when the need for defense outweighed all other concerns . The people who lived here would have had to travel the half-mile trail down the hill for water and to tend their fields . <p> Even today , except for one ranch in the valley below , the site is surrounded by the Tonto National Forest 's desert and mountains . The Hohokam could have seen enemies coming from miles away . Archaeologists have reconstructed short walls of stone to show visitors where the rooms were and metal plaques have been put up , but little else has been done to the site . It felt like we were the first ones to stumble across this ruin . <p> Pioneer Arizona Living History Museum <p> For a more recent part of Phoenix 's roots , we visited the Pioneer Arizona Living History Museum . As we arrived , " Doc Holliday " got into his car to go out for lunch , while all the other cowboys crowded into the bar . <p> Unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were part of Arizona 's frontier era . Costumed interpreters bring it all to life again . Lillie Langtry once sang in the opera house . The general store still sports a potbellied stove , and after lunch , the cowboys were slated for shooting practice . <p> Between the Sears-Kay Ruin and the Pioneer Arizona Living History Museum are two quaint towns , Cave Creek and Carefree . Carefree boasts the world 's largest sundial , while Cave Creek has interesting shops with everything western from clothing to furniture to kitsch . <p> Scottsdale <p> No visit to Phoenix is complete without an afternoon spent strolling through Scottsdale 's Old Town . Sculptures stand on nearly every corner . Shops with Western wear , Indian crafts and jewelry , fine art , boots , hats and other goodies line the streets . Dozens of restaurants compete to have the most mouthwatering menu . <p> We spent an hour at the River Trading Post , torn between the exquisitely painted kachina dolls and the stunning Navajo jewelry . ( Jewelry won . ) At the AZ-Tex Hat Co. my daughter tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident dogs . At dinner time , some locals recommended a festive Mexican restaurant , Los Olivos . My dinner of green corn tamales brought me back to the Hohokam . <p> After all , they probably ate similar corn dishes when they farmed this river valley  --  a thousand years ago . <p> IF YOU GO <p> Getting there <p> Expect to pay $250-$300 for a round-trip direct flight from Atlanta to Phoenix . <p> Where to stay <p> Phoenix has lots of chain hotels , especially near the airport .
