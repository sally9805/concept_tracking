History has no record of Grover Cleveland and Grover Cleveland ever sitting down together . That 's odd , since the two Presidents occupied the Oval Office just four years apart  --  Cleveland from 1885 to 1889 , and Cleveland following him there in 1893 . Had it not been for the four years Benjamin Harrison served as President between them , the country could have transitioned from one Cleveland to the other without even changing the monogrammed bathrobe in the White House residence . <P> Had Cleveland and Cleveland ever spoken , it would have been a decidedly one-way conversation , since they were the same man . But you would n't know it from American history books . Right there in the great march of Presidents , from Washington at No. 1 to Bush at 43 , is Cleveland clocking in at 22 and then again  --  like a presidential whack-a-mole  --  at 24 . We 're a country with 43 Presidents , but only 42 men have held the job . The two President Bushes affectionately refer to each other by the nicknames 41 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 and 42 . <P> It was last week 's coverage of the controversy concerning the planet Pluto that brought Cleveland to mind ( and , no , not because of his physique ; that was Taft ) . Much the way 19th century pundits no doubt fought over which numeral to assign the inconveniently nonconsecutive Cleveland , astronomers have spent the past few years debating whether or not Pluto is in fact a planet or whether new findings place it in a family of smaller , humbler objects . The problem is more complex than just firing a planet and downsizing the solar system from nine to eight . If you keep your definitions loose enough to retain Pluto , then you have to award the planet label to at least three similar objects in our solar system . Think Congress gets into a slapfest over the problem of immigrant workers ? That 's civil compared with astronomers ' catfights over immigrant worlds . <P> So let 's be clear : Pluto has to go . Clean out your locker , turn in your playbook and go see the coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other walk-ons and wannabes that the roster is frozen . We 're sticking with the original eight . <P> There 's sound scientific reason to return the solar system to what it was before Pluto the poseur was discovered in 1930 . True planets form in roughly the equatorial plane of the sun , occupying specific , permanent orbits . That 's not Pluto . It is a tiny joyrider from the rubble stream surrounding the solar system that broke free and orbits the sun in a tilted , elongated orbit . <P> But astronomers do n't see things so simply . Instead , they 've appointed a committee that met in Paris in June and July and drafted a proposed solution that defines a planet by shape , center of orbital gravity and more . Committees and clarity do n't go together , and the proposal is just what critics feared : science as tax code , with the cosmos codified in such elaborate ways that , never mind nine planets , we could end up with dozens .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
