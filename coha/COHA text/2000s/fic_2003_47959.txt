There were a bunch of us who had drawn together into a corner of the dining room . It was a big party , and none of us had met before . But a tiny core of women of a certain age had drawn more women until there were enough of us that we needed to be democratic about talking-each of us needed to be careful not to take up too much airtime . <p> We were talking about kissing , and we spoke rapidly and excitedly and laughed loudly . This was T-shirt and jeans laughter , not cocktail dress laughter-it came from the belly , not the chest . It was size fourteen and not size two . When one of us made moves toward some wilting hors d'oeuvre , the rest would stall , so that nothing good was missed by anyone . <p> We seemed to like best telling about our first times . There was a glamorous blonde wearing huge diamond studs who said she first kissed at age eleven , while playing spin the bottle on a hot Texas night . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go into the kitchen , stand by the washing machine stationed in the corner , and kiss . No tongues . The blonde modified the rule to include no lips . Cheeks . That was all . But a certain Paul Drummond was too fast for her that night , and smacked a kiss right on her mouth . She said she 'd intended to get angry , but instead backed with pleasant shock into the washer hard enough to make a noise that roused the supposedly supervising parent from sleep . The kissing stopped ; the party broke up , and the blonde went home , where she stayed awake much of the night reenacting the scene in her mind , and telling herself that the sin was venial , venial , venial . <p> A woman named Vicky said she spent years in practice with her best friend Mary Jo . " We would put a pillow between our faces , kneel down on my bed , rub each other 's backs , and kiss that pillow to death . " We all laughed some more , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One woman wearing a seductively cut black dress that now seemed beside the point ventured bravely that she and her best friend Sherry had dispensed with the pillow and gone at it lip to lip . You could tell from the ripple effect of lowered eyes that she was n't the only one . I thought of fourth grade and my friend Mary , whom I asked to be the wife so I could be the husband . I liked to be the husband-you got to say when about everything . While she dusted , I went to work . When I came home , we kissed hello for what became long enough that we decided we 'd better start playing outside . <p> There was a serious , shy-looking woman named Jane who had n't said much of anything , and who , when she laughed , had actually put her hand up over her mouth . Oh , honey , I wanted to say to her , when I saw her do that . Sweetheart , come here and let 's give you some tools . She wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each one was closed . I was pretty surprised to hear her say , " Oh well , kissing was one thing , but do you remember the first time you touched a dick ? " <p> Now we were all into high gear . We were beside ourselves in our eagerness to share our experiences . We drew closer . <p> A roving rent-a-waiter dressed in tight black pants , a blindingly white shirt , and a black bow tie offered us little bundles of something from his tray . All of us , to a woman , took one . The waiter seemed very pleased . I waited for him to move on , then greedily opened : " I was forced . This guy called ' Telephone Pole Taylor , ' for the very reason you might suspect , pulled my hand down and held it there until I had touched it for five seconds . We counted together . I almost threw up . I was a serious virgin , and I damn near passed out at the thought that kind of thing would someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I became kind of intrigued by the texture . " <p> Vicky 's eyes widened . " Yes ! Like damp velvet , right ? " <p> Jane , standing next to me , sighed quietly . " I do n't know , " she said . " Men 's bodies are just not pretty . That makes it difficult . I think women 's bodies are , though , and I 'm not , you know . . . " We knew . She took a sip from her drink , leaned her head against the wall , frowned in a contemplative sort of way . " It turned out that penises were n't so bad , really , although it did take me a long time to get used to that rising and falling routine . I mean , it was grotesque the first time I saw an erection . It was like a monster movie . " <p> The gorgeous blonde spoke up . " I liked it ! I thought it was so magical . " But then , as though protecting Jane , she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We drank to that . <p> " It 's the balls that get me , " Vicky said . " They 're like kiwifruit gone bad . " We burst out laughing again . I think we felt that we were becoming dangerous , careening in our conversation , and we liked it . We were ready to reveal anything about ourselves . Almost imperceptibly , the circle tightened again . <p> " I think it 's all a matter of cultural conditioning , " I said , and was met with a friendly collective groan . " No , I mean it . If we 'd been taught to go after a penis by a mother who winked at us when she talked about it , and if all the boys at those drive-in movies had covered their privates with both hands and moaned little protests into our ears , we 'd have been wild to touch them . Instead , we pulled their hands down from our tits and up from their crotches . " <p> Jane put her empty glass on the floor . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonder we get along at all . Sometimes the smallest things can bring out the biggest things . I had a horrible fight with my husband last night , and you know what started it ? " We were all listening hard , and we did n't notice the approach of Jane 's husband from across the room . But Jane did . She stopped talking and stared at him : in her eyes , it was as though a shade had been pulled . <p> He stood at the edge of our circle , a little wary . " What 's going on over Here ? " <p> There was a beat ; no one answered . And then Jane said , " Oh , you know . Just girl talk . " I think we were all miffed by her response , but no one challenged it . <p> Her husband looked at his watch . " It 's time to go . " <p> Jane did n't budge . " I 'd like to stay for a while . " <p> " Oh ? " He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's fine . " He did n't move . Another beat . Silence all around . Then two of us simultaneously moved toward the food table . Someone else walked off toward the bathroom . Vicky waved to a man across the room and started for him . Our group fell apart in a sad , slow-motion sort of way , as when petals leave a blossom past its prime . And then I heard Jane say , " I guess it is late . " <p> I listened to her say goodbye to the people around her . I was dragging a piece of pita bread through the leftover hummus tracks at the bottom of a pottery bowl . I was hoping the potter used no lead . I was wondering what my children were doing . <p> I thought about what I had to do the next day as I finished my drink . Then I looked around for my husband . He was in the living room discussing the Middle East conflict with a short , mildly overweight , balding man . I imagined the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years ago . I gave him hair , but otherwise I did n't change him much . <p> I sat in a chair close-by and heard my husband say emphatically that Israel fought only defensive wars . I fiddled with the hem of my skirt and wondered what it was Jane and her husband had fought about . Several possibilities occurred to me . I heard the short man ask my husband what he did for a living . Sports would be next . I turned my head away from them and permitted myself a yawn . <p> I thought , Here is how I feel about men : I am angry at them for the way they sling their advantage about-interrupting , taking over , forcing endings , pretending to not understand what equality between the sexes necessitates , thus ensuring that they are always and forever the ones who say when . But I feel sorry for them , too . <p> I remembered a redeye flight I was on recently . At about four a.m. , I fell into one of those poor quality sleeps . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the aisle . The plane was packed with businessmen , and they all lay sleeping , their briefcases at their feet like obedient dogs . They had blankets with the airline 's imprint over them , but the too-small covers had slid to one side or the other , revealing gaps between buttons on the dress shirts , revealing fists slightly clenched . They looked so sweet then , so honest and vulnerable . I felt a great love toward all of them , and smiled warmly into each sleeping face . <p>
