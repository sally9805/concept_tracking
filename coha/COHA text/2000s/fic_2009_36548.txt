the prison of crere sulace and certain of its inhabitants <p> Dumesne , huge and crazy , took a step toward Raieve and flashed his ugly teeth . He showed her the blade of a thin knife in his belt and smiled at her . <p> Raieve spared a glance for the Low Guard of Watch and found him nowhere in evidence . She planted her foot and stood firm in the freezing narrow courtyard that separated the towers of Crere Sulace , facing Dumesne . A new fall of snow twisted in the windy courtyard , settling on clothing and hair and dusting the courtyard walls with white . Many of the assembled prisoners , in their ragged furs and cheap boots , clapped their bare hands against the cold and urged Dumesne on . Some of the others , the pretty folk , hung back and watched with feigned disinterest from afar . Mauritane , the strong quiet one , stared directly at her . She felt his eyes watching her movements , appraising her . <p> Raieve glared at her attacker . " See these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the left side of her head and holding them before her . " I earned each one of them facing an armed opponent with my bare hands . " <p> Dumesne ran his gloved fingers over his recently shaved head , the tips of his ears rising just above the top of his skull . " I once had more braids than you could count , foreigner . Do n't make me cut your tongue out before I kill you . " <p> Raieve whirled her metal-tipped braids like whipcords and flashed them out . One of them caught Dumesne in the eye and he staggered back , clutching his face . He went for the knife then , but it was already gone . When he managed both eyes open again , she was holding it in his face . <p> There was courteous applause from the pretty section . From the corner of her eye , she watched some of them pass coins back and forth . They were betting on her . Mauritane , though , did not move . <p> " You fight like a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife in his thigh and dragged it out at an angle . Dumesne pinwheeled backward and she advanced on him . " Where I come from , " she said , " there is no higher compliment . " She swept with her left leg , and Dumesne fell to the ground , clutching his wound . " Must I kill you now , " shouted Raieve over the yells of the crowd , " or do I have your oath of respect ? " <p> " I would rather be dead than swear oath to a woman and a foreigner . " <p> " That is your option , " she said . She raised the knife . <p> " Halt ! " came a voice from the side . Mauritane rose and approached them . Raieve held the knife still , waiting . <p> " This is no concern of yours , " said Raieve . <p> Mauritane approached her and took the knife from her hand . He made her feel like a child ; it never occurred to her to defend against him . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dumesne sneered the title . <p> " Give me your oath , " said Mauritane , " and you can suffer your humiliation and live . Otherwise , I 'll leave the two of you to your business . " He glared at Dumesne . <p> Dumesne looked back and forth between them . He hung his head . " I swear it . By oak and thorn I swear it . No harm will come to the woman by my hand . " <p> " Wise choice , " said Mauritane . He helped Dumesne to his feet . " Go , " he said , " or I 'll fillet you myself . " He handed Dumesne the knife , handle first . <p> " You made me look small , " Raieve said , once Mauritane had led her back to the fire . The crowd was dispersing , and the ragged onlookers gave Mauritane a wide berth . <p> " No , I saved your life , " Mauritane answered . " Dumesne has blood oaths sworn with twenty other inmates . Any of them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <p> " I would face them all , " said Raieve , her pride making her face glow red . <p> " No doubt , " said Mauritane , sweeping his braids back from his face as he leaned over the fire . " But that would be a poor strategy for survival here . You 're new . You need to learn patience . " <p> " Why did he call you Captain ? " asked Raieve after a brief pause . " Are you an officer of the Unseelie Army ? " <p> " No , " said Mauritane . <p> " What then ? " <p> " The honorific no longer applies to me , so it does n't matter . You may call me Mauritane , if you wish . " <p> He was quiet then . He pulled out a pipe and lit it , squinting at the sky . Raieve looked up as well but saw only gray . Around the cornice of the East Tower , a few crows flitted through the swirling snowflakes . <p> She looked at Mauritane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pipe . He was not young , but far from old . The thin creases in his face stood out , ruddy in the freezing air . His braids were long and precise , done in the military style of the Kingdom , unlike Raieve 's , which she 'd tied herself without the aid of a mirror , standing over the men she 'd killed to earn them . Built compactly , Mauritane was only a finger taller than she , but he carried himself the way a taller man stands , and his shoulders were wide and strong . <p> " Do I meet with your approval ? " Mauritane asked , not looking at her . <p> She scowled and turned away , breathing a curse only when she knew he could not hear it . <p> * * * <p> The prison was once the summer home of Prince Crere Sulace , the Faerie lord of Twin Birch Torn , but the Queen appropriated it in the distant past over some forgotten sin , and its lord was incarcerated there . Over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to those not fated for the hangman 's noose or the executioner 's ax . It was a gulag for lords who no longer found favor at court , ranking officials in the polity who were caught with their hands in the coffers , and visiting dignitaries from worlds who managed to earn the Queen 's spite . Those prisoners of the lower classes were lumped in with them , it was rumored , simply out of spite . <p> The setting for Crere Sulace , among the granite cliffs and the weeping heather of the Channel Sea lands , is dreary enough in the fair years , but in Midwinter the snow-clad peaks and ashen parapets sing of gloom and frustration . In Midwinter the prisoners can see their own breath ; they must wear scavenged heavy furs out in the courtyard ; they linger by the braziers at the guardhouse gates , swapping stories with the grizzled deputy wardens and guards . <p> The South Tower was once the primary residence of the Prince Crere Sulace in the time of the Unseelie Wars . Old prisoners believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spellturned halls of the tower , singing spirit songs of death and decay . The towers had been turned dozens , if not hundreds , of times in years past , and now it was no easy thing to say which room was next to which other or what distance separated any two places in the tower . In recent years , the ghostly apparitions and vertiginous twisting hallways finally caused enough harm that the Chief Warden was forced to take notice . He shut down the tower for all but bulk storage and the maintenance of the sea lamp in the cupola . <p> In the highest floor of the tower , Jem Alan , the ViceWarden , checked the lamp oil for the sea lamp and tilted the reflector out a bit in case some fishermen from Hawthorne were north this evening , hunting the dark northern lanes for sturgeon and salmon . The hour was approaching sunset , or what passed for it in this icy hell of a season , and he did n't want to get caught in the South Tower after dark . Buttoning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slick steps along the tower 's inner wall . Tired green witchlight cast multiple shadows over the steps , and as there was no rail , Jem Alan hugged the wall , holding his torch before him like a ward . He tried to ignore the heaving , moaning sounds that came from the barred doors at each landing . <p> He closed the tower 's inner door and sealed it with its rune before opening the outer door . Across the main yard he saw a cluster of inmates singing shanties with Gray Mave , the Low Chief ofWatch . Mave was a local , one of the Hawthorne natives who eschewed fishing in the cold Channel Sea waters for lighter duty at Crere Sulace . <p> " Enough , Low Chief , " called Jem Alan from across the yard . He marched to the guardhouse and leaned on the cord for the Evening Watch bell . The snow that had begun earlier in the day was erratic now , coming in fits and starts , visible only in the slowly growing halo around the fire . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " <p> Mave reached slowly into his pockets for a pair of gloves , his heavy frame causing his own cloak to billow around him comically . <p> " And have someone brought in to recharge the witchlight on the tower steps , " added Jem Alan . " I nearly killed myself coming down just now . " Jem Alan removed his own gloves , tired brown things with holes cut for the fingers , and held them over the fire . <p> " Riders will come tonight , " said Mave suddenly , his eyes pondering the firelight around the grill . " It will be the beginning of bad things . " <p> " Do n't be superstitious , " said Jem Alan . " Are you a witch woman , that you can see things in fire ? " <p> Gray Mave shrugged . " I only know it , is all . " <p> Jem Alan rolled his eyes . " Get to your post . " <p> * * * <p> Night had nearly fallen on the mountains when the riders appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that this was a royal emissary , sporting the blue and gold griffon standard of the Seelie Court . Gray Mave , keeping the Evening Watch , sent up the spot flare and rang the visitors ' bell in the guard tower . <p> Chief Warden Crenyllice summoned Jem Alan to his office , which comprised the entire second floor of the North Tower . <p> " Vice Warden , did I just hear the visitors ' bell ? " <p> " Aye , sir . " Jem Alan struggled to fasten the straps of his dress tunic around his barrel chest . <p> " This is unexpected . " <p> " Aye , sir . The supply train is n't due for a fortnight . This party flies royal colors , sir . " Jem Alan chose to omit his hearing of Mave 's prediction earlier in the evening . <p> The Chief Warden ran his fingers through his hair , drawing his single braid forward so that it brushed against the medals on his chest . <p> " If they 're here out of turn then it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards come to line in the yard , and be quick about it . And by the Queen 's tits , have the men in uniform . " <p> Five riders in formation approached the crest of the pass , which was a knife 's edge crevice that received snow year-round during Midwinter . Framed neatly between the nearly vertical rock faces that composed the pass , the Prison Crere Sulace rose from its plateau of rough basalt and granite like an embedded snowflake , its spellturned towers and crumbling spires forming a ghostlike symmetry against the darker rock face from which it projected . <p> The lead rider was the color point , carrying two standards cross-armed . One was the blue and gold griffon of the Queen . The other , smaller flag was the purple sign of the Royal Guard , the Queen 's personal army . Flanking the center rider was a pair of Standard Guards , bearing the insignia of their companies on their capes , their lances slung at their backs . The post rider was the junior officer , a lieutenant by rank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored mount , was the party 's leader , wearing the cape of a commander in the Royal Guard . He rode in the chill wind with the hood of his cloak pushed back , his nine victory braids whipping behind him in the wind . He stood his mount with perfect poise , even over the slick terrain of the rocky pass , his eyes fixed on Crere Sulace . <p> The commander , whose name was Purane-Es , motioned the party to stop just past the summit of the pass . The road dipped gently here down to the flat plateau abreast of the ocean . At the far end of the plateau , the road led up a steep incline to the gates of Crere Sulace and ended there . <p> From Purane-Es 's vantage point , it was clear that Crere Sulace was no longer the summer estate of a grand lord of Faerie , nor had been for many , many years . The walls showed signs of age and disrepair . The balconies along the rooftop of the structure 's South Tower had been replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , a coil of iron wire angled down toward the palace ; a measure meant to keep people in rather than out . <p> Originating in the South Tower , a spot flare sparked in the sky , reaching an altitude that brought it over the ocean . It crackled three times in a welcome of tenacious recognition . It was now Purane-Es 's turn . He nodded to his lieutenant , who retrieved a signaling flare from his saddlebags and sent it into the air . Three more cracks signaled the party 's friendly intentions . Purane-Es dug in his spurs and urged the party forward . <p> A trio of mounted guards , including Jem Alan , rode out from the gates to meet them . They quickly exchanged formal courtesies ( a process much accelerated due to the cold ) and rode through the gates together . <p> Chief Warden Crenyllice stood at attention in the loggia that lined the main yard 's south wall . When Purane-Es dismounted , Crenyllice bowed deeply to him and quickly waved to the grooms to fetch the party 's horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Crenyllice , bowing again . " It is indeed an honor for us to receive a guest of your rank . May your children meet you in Arcadia . " <p> Purane-Es nodded . " Take me to your office , " he said . " I 'm here on important business . " His silver braids fell around his face . <p> Crenyllice frowned at the lack of etiquette but had no room to show his displeasure . The commander outranked him by orders of magnitude , and his impropriety would have to pass without comment . <p> Once in Crenyllice 's office , Purane-Es removed his gloves and brushed snow from his shoulders and hair . He seated himself without being asked . <p> " May I offer you a drink ? " said Crenyllice hopefully . <p> Purane-Es 's face softened . " Aye , a brandy will do . " <p> Crenyllice squirmed against the vague insult of " will do , " but said nothing as he fixed the drink himself , waving the guards back , and handed it to the commander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Army , sire , doing our best with what we receive , " said Crenyllice . " I 'm afraid this brandy is the best I can offer , you see . " <p> " Please spare me your homespun attempts at courtesy , " said Purane-Es , bored . " It embarrasses both of us . In my presence you will simply do as I say and leave the formalities for your betters . " <p> Crenyllice 's face reddened , but he said nothing . <p> " I come with a letter from the Chamberlain Marcuse , " said Purane-Es , finishing his drink . " The letter instructs you to release several inmates on my recognizance , to perform an errand for Her Majesty . " <p> Crenyllice sputtered . " But sire . Surely the guard ... " <p> Purane-Es waved his hand . " Even in this darkened corner of the world , I presume things do not always follow the straight path . It is not yours to question . You will do as you are instructed . " <p> " Which prisoners ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have in mind : Mauritane . Do you know of him ? " <p> " Aye , sir . He 's been mine for two years now . " <p> " Now he 's mine . I want him brought to me , and I will allow him to choose the remainder of his party . " <p> " What is the task for which he is summoned , sire ? " <p> Purane-Es laughed . " I 'm sure that 's none of your concern . Only see that Mauritane is brought to me quickly . " <p> * * * <p> Gray Mave knocked quietly on the door to Mauritane 's cell . Once a grand bedroom , the space had been spellturned so many times that it seemed an echo of itself . Not even Gray Mave , who 'd been a guard at Crere Sulace for twenty years , knew how many of it existed in the tower . <p> " Come , " said Mauritane . He lay on his bunk , fully dressed , as though he were expecting to be disturbed . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the original wall coverings and paintings having been removed ages ago , light shapes on the tattered wallpaper their only legacy . <p> Gray Mave fitted his key into the lock and opened the door outward . " You 're to come to the warden 's office right away . " Mave 's fat face heaved as he strained to catch his breath . <p> " What is it ? " Mauritane sat up warily . <p> " A lord from the City Emerald , sir . Rode in flying royal colors . Wanted to see you personally . " <p> Mauritane rose and pulled on his fur cloak . " You do n't have to call me ' sir , ' you know , " he said . <p> Gray Mave bowed his head . " I know , sir . But considering your history , it does n't seem right to call you by name . " <p> " Much lower men than you have called me worse , " Mauritane said . " I do n't see that it matters much these days , anyhow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manacles Mave placed on him without question . <p> " I should tell you , " said Mave , as they walked the darkened hallway . " Since you 've given me no trouble during your stay here and all . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I 've had a premonition . Bad omen . The riders that have come . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
