<p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed off Friday on a five-year farm bill that would keep multibillion-dollar subsidies flowing to cotton , corn and a handful of other crops , deeply disappointing Bay Area food and environmental activists who had hoped that Congress might shift federal farm policy this year to combat obesity , air and water pollution and industrial farming . <p> Pelosi , a San Francisco Democrat , hailed as reform a bill that would grant subsidies to farmers earning up to $1 million  --  five times more than the cap sought by the Bush administration  --  while increasing actual payments to farmers . The bill comes during the most prosperous era American agriculture has seen in decades as crop prices and farm income approach or set record highs . <p> " Bush seems to be taking a harder stance on millionaires than the Democratic Party , which is surprising , " said Kari Hamerschlag , policy director for the California Coalition for Food and Farming , a Watsonville group urging lawmakers to move money from crop subsidies to environmental and nutrition programs . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee , would add $1.6 billion for environmental and pest detection programs and research for California 's fruit , nut and vegetable crops . It also would add money for farmers ' markets and to provide more fresh produce in school lunch programs . Approval of the money is a breakthrough for the state 's specialty crop industry , which receives no direct subsidies . <p> But the bill leaves the big commodity programs intact for cotton , corn , wheat , rice , soybeans and a handful of other crops that have been subsidized since the Dust Bowl in the 1930s . <p> Last year , farmers received more than $21 billion in crop subsidies . Average farm incomes are about 20 percent higher than the average U.S. household income . <p> The committee even threw in an export subsidy for tobacco . <p> If anything , " we 've actually increased the rates at which we support prices " for subsidized crops , said Daniel Sumner , a leading farm economist and director of the Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis . " We 've really done nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's a mistake for the country . " <p> Pelosi 's prime motivation in supporting the current farm policy apparently is to preserve the re-election prospects of freshman Democrats in rural districts who toppled Republicans in November and helped secure Democrats their House majority and Pelosi the speakership . Nine of the freshmen sit on the House Agriculture Committee . Several said they feared any vote to reform farm programs would endanger their political prospects . <p> Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said the speaker was trying to " balance equities " between competing groups . <p> The Bay Area has become a hotbed of opposition to this year 's farm bill . Food activists have teamed with environmentalists to form the most potent coalition in 75 years against the traditional farm lobby , one of the most powerful in Washington . Subsidized commodity interests dominate the House and Senate agriculture committees . <p> Led by Michael Pollan , a professor at UC Berkeley , and Berkeley restaurateur Alice Waters , food activists have become a force against crop subsidies , pushing for what Pollan calls a food bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse and locally grown food as well as more fresh food in federal nutrition programs such as food stamps and school lunches . They have tied the nation 's obesity epidemic to subsidies for corn and soybeans  --  the source of high fructose corn syrup and vegetable oils widely used in processed foods . <p> Ken Cook , president and founder of the Environmental Working Group , said the activists are " shocked that this would be considered reform . " <p> House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson , a Democrat whose Minnesota district receives large corn subsidies , said Pelosi backs his bill and will use her power to make sure it passes the House next week . <p> Peterson called the $1 million payment limit a " huge change in direction " and warned that the House leadership would quash any attempt  --  a rebellion has been promised by Rep. Ron Kind , D-Wis.  --  to make any significant changes . <p> " This is not a deal just between me and the folks that represent these people , " Peterson said , referring to members representing subsidized farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Peterson dismissed critics outside the traditional farm belt . <p> " I know people on the outside can sit and complain about this , but frankly most of those people have no clue what they 're talking about , " Peterson said . " Most people in the city have no concept of what 's going on here . " <p> Commodity groups ridiculed the idea that subsidies have anything to do with obesity . <p> " The farm bill did not require people to eat more than they should , " Daren Coppock , chief executive of the National Association of Wheat Growers , told a Washington conference this year . " If the farm bill causes obesity , it also causes AIDS , global warming , the extinction of endangered species , bad grades in school and probably dancing . " <p> But the activists , backed by many agricultural economists , argue that the subsidies produce no public benefit . If federal tax dollars are to be spent in the farm economy , they argue , the money should go to things that benefit the public as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental programs ... is a much better way of supporting the goals that U.S. taxpayers and consumers have for our agriculture programs , " said Ann Tutwiler , a leading farm policy expert who is a managing director for the Hewlett Foundation . <p> The same goes for shifting money to nutrition , she said . " Where the activist community is coming down is a better place for U.S. farm policy to be . " <p> Martha Noble , a senior policy analyst at the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition , said alternatives to crop subsidies include " conservation , research for organics and specialty crops  --  fruits , vegetables , grasses , things that grow in a diversified food system  --  certainly better nutrition , more attention to local foods and local markets . " <p> Activists groups have taken aim at payments for commodities for two reasons : The money provides incentives to increase the use of pesticides and fertilizers and expand farm operations to capture more subsidies . That leads to larger farms and monocultures of single grain crops such as corn and wheat over millions of acres in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding up in the pockets of landowners , who may or may not be farmers , and making it difficult for younger farmers to get started . <p> Cattle ranchers who use grass pastures are at a disadvantage to large feed lots that use subsidized corn and other feed grains , Noble said , and places such as Iowa and Indiana that once grew apples and vegetables now grow mainly corn . <p> " We could have a much better agricultural system in this country , more diversity , more diverse food available in lots of different regions " without the subsidies , Noble said . <p> Rep. Kind promised to lead a fight on the House floor , hoping to pick up many Democrats for his plan to change the bill . <p> " We anticipate large bipartisan support , " Kind said . " I do n't think the farm bill is in final form by any stretch of the imagination . The process is just starting . "
