On Labor Day my mother and brother piled the station wagon with all our things . Well , except for the ones that had already gone ahead , our furniture and books , on the Whiteflower Van Lines moving truck . So our car is packed with suitcases , duffel bags , Dad 's hats , our computer , and our two cats . We stood on Lincoln Street in front of our house  --  I refuse to say " our old house , " even though it 's been sold and new people are about to move in  --  and Mom told us to say goodbye . <br> I felt like an invisible girl observing the scene : Mom , shorter than I am , thin , shoulder-length brownish hair , wearing jeans and one of Dad 's old shirts ; Travis , a beanpole with shoulders from all that football , dark brown hair in his blue eyes , Dad 's blue eyes  --  the men in our family have dark blue eyes , Carrie 's are light blue , and Mom and I have hazel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , white with green shutters  --  I painted those shutters with Carrie and Travis just last summer  --  and the two maple trees and the dogwoods and big magnolia in the front yard , shady and nice . Carrie taught me how to climb those trees . <br> Mom looked up at Carrie 's room . Travis stood there with his hands in his pockets , gaze as blank as the windows he was staring at . Actually , that 's a lie . He had frown lines between his eyebrows . How could he not , about to leave the only house our family had ever known ? Me , I refused to say goodbye . If you do n't shut the door on something , it means you can always walk back through , right ? <br> Mom taped a note on the door . Can you believe that ? As if Carrie is just going to walk up the sidewalk and read that we 've gone to Newport . Just as if we 've gone to the store , or to the ball field , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you think about it . Not just that Carrie wo n't be home to read any note , but that Mom would even think of leaving one for her . <br> Anyway , we turned and got in the car . Travis sits up front with Mom . I ride in back with the cats . Neither Travis nor I mention the note , but we do give each other a look . Strange , his eyebrows say to me . Whacked , my grimace says to him . <br> So that 's how we left Columbus : one of us snuffling , one of us frowning , one of us petting cats . At fourteen , almost fifteen , I 'm too young to drive . But Travis is sixteen , so he helps Mom out , taking the wheel for hours at a stretch . They keep asking me if I want to pick the radio station , or if I 'm hungry and want to stop , or if I need to use the restroom . But nothing can pry words out of me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching into the cat carriers to pet Desdemona and Grisby . Des is mine . Grisby was my sister 's . I 'm taking care of her now . <br> I have what 's called " stubborn anger . " That 's what the shrink said . Because everything is wrong . What happened last summer made me lose my mind . That 's different from stubborn anger . That 's not being able to stand the feeling of air on your skin because your sister is gone . For months afterward , I could n't draw a breath without feeling someone had stuck a knife into my heart . My mother thinks it 's just normal grief , but it 's not . My grades , well , let 's just say they have suffered . English , C ; Earth Science , B2 ; Art , D ; Geometry , A. I 'm okay in math , so even though I have n't applied myself , I get by . I skipped regular math last year , went straight into high school geometry . <br> The strange thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equations , notations  --  as if there was a problem to solve , and it involved numbers instead of words . Words get in the way . Numbers do n't lie . We are two sisters ; add us up . Carrie + Beck = Us . <br> My friends have gathered round me ... kind of , anyway . The ones who have n't deserted me , that is . The ones who still speak to me have held me up , carried me through . I could n't have survived without them . I 'm holding on to the fact that a few people still like me . <br> And now my mother 's taking me away from them . Away from Carrie . Without Carrie , I 'm less than a person . It 's like subtracting one from one . That equals zero . Except , as all mathematicians know , there 's really no such number as zero . So I live my life in confusion . Logic and emotion are at war . <br> That 's where the stubborn anger comes in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Columbus . She says she needs a job to support us , and I say fine  --  does it have to be in Rhode Island ? Does n't she know without my sister I 'll cease to exist ? Just try x minus x . Where does that leave you ? <br> Exactly . <br> My mother explains that we do n't know that Carrie is in Columbus anymore , in fact we are pretty sure she 's far , far away . She does n't have to tell me that we all have our own special ways of losing our minds , and Carrie 's seems to have involved running away from home and , after a lifetime of being the perfect older child , turning into a street person somewhere . Have I mentioned that this is not a recent development ? <br> My older sister left home , or should I say the cabin , the very same day our father died . That was over a year ago . She had a major flip-out , I guess you could say . And that flip-out is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional hang-up and the once-in-a-blue-moon postcard . Even though we have n't received any emails from her , my mother has set our family email to a permanent away message : Carrie ! We love you ! We are moving to Newport and want you to be with us ! Here is our address and phone number . Call , sweetheart ! <br> I mean , Jesus Christ ! <br> Here 's what I plan to do : ride all the way from Ohio to Rhode Island without saying one word . I 'm not going to eat , either . Hunger strike . Eventually we 'll get to Newport . Mom will point out the apartment she and her sister lived in when they were young , before whatever happened that drove them apart . <br> She 'll mention that it 's a fresh start , that we have our whole lives to look forward to . One thing she will not mention is the water , which will be everywhere . Then she 'll pull up to the private school where starting next week she will be teaching English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Here be rich snobs ! <br> That enrollment will not happen , trust me . Can you imagine attending a school full of millionaire brats where your mother teaches ? Why do n't I just put my eyes out instead ? It would be more fun . <br> I will helpfully empty the station wagon . I will carry the cats into the house Newport Academy has given my mother as part of her teaching contract . My sister 's photographs , the ones she took and called her " Great Girls " series , will go straight into my mother 's room . I will feed the cats , show them their litter box , remind my mother and Travis that they are not to go outside  --  Carrie always wanted Grisby to be an indoor cat , and that is how it will be . <br> Then , the minute my mother and brother are asleep , I will walk out the door . I 've got funds stashed for the trip home . Birthday cash , babysitting money , contributions from my best friends Amy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrink says is another cry for help  --  let 's not go into it , but I stole a couple of things , including money from my mother 's wallet , and got caught . I gave most of it back . But I kept a little , to help me get home . <br> " So , my little storm cloud , " my mother says from the front seat . " Are you comfortable back there ? " <br> I grunt instead of speaking . <br> " You 're not hungry , you do n't care what music we listen to , you have n't said one word . " <br> " She 'll eat if we stop at Cracker Barrel , " Travis says . " She likes the buffet . " <br> " What do you say , Beck ? Should I get off the highway ? " <br> I just keep petting Grisby . What is wrong with Travis ? Seething does n't begin to cover what I 'm feeling . Carrie loved Cracker Barrel , not me . Caroline Anne Shaw . Get it straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been joined at the heart with my sister , but my taste in roadside food is different . I like the Pancake King . The highway flies by in a blur . Cars , trucks , exits , all taking us closer to Rhode Island . I want to jump out before we cross one more state line . <br> " Let 's stop , Mom , " Travis says . " We 'll eat and then I 'll drive for a while . " <br> Easy for him to be sweet , I think . Ally is so in love with my brother she 'll fly east constantly just to see him . Her father 's a doctor and has the money . He 's divorced from her mother and bribes Ally to love him best . Ally wants for nothing , not even Travis . So he 's got nothing to lose from this whole move , not like I do . <br> My mother puts on the signal light . Slouched in the back seat , I hear it , click-click-click . Trees along the exit ramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway ; it 's filled with billboards and stores and restaurants , one after the other , so many to choose from . I shut my eyes tight , because I do n't want to think of food and feel hungrier than I already am . <br> My stomach rumbles . I 'm starving . <br> " Okay , storm cloud , " my mother says . " Come on , now . Let 's go in and have something good for dinner ... . " <br> I pull the cats closer . I refuse to eat . All I want is to go home . I want my sister , and I want to go home . One hand slides into the thick envelope where her pictures are , and I slip a few out so I can see . This one shows a six-year-old girl jumping rope . Here 's one of a woman pinning clothes to a clothesline . And another , two girls talking at their lockers in school . <br> I do n't want to go to a school where my mother teaches . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is nervous and trying not to show it , which gives me a stomachache . If she 's worried , how am I supposed to feel ? I ca n't even think about the water . They call Newport " the City by the Sea . " <br> My brother stands outside the car making impatient noises while my mother opens the back door , leans in to put her arms around me , her lips to my ear , and whispers , " Put those away for now , sweetheart . " <br> " I do n't want to . " <br> So she does it for me  --  takes the pictures out of my hand , slides them back into the envelope . Does she do that because she thinks looking at them makes me sad ? Or is she afraid I 'll damage Carrie 's pictures in some way ? <br> " Things will be better when we get to Newport , " she says . <br> " Stop , " I say , the ghost of my old lisp coming back , and I hear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even there yet , and besides , I do n't believe her . All that water . I want to stay here , make things right . Make everyone like me again . Most of the time I say my s 's and l 's perfectly . No one makes fun of me for that anymore  --  I got through it . <br> Carrie helped me get over my lisp . She coached me through my speech exercises . With my sister , I overcame the obstacle . She ca n't help me with this , though . C + B = Us . I hold on to that truth . Mathematics and logic do n't lie . So I sit in the back seat in perfect silence , just glaring into my mother 's eyes . She does n't know what I know about Carrie 's last day . See , when she 's ready , Carrie is coming back . <br> Storm clouds do n't speak . And there 's no such number as zero . <br> Chapter Two <br> Newport greeted them with bright blue water sparkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thick roses tumbling over high stone walls . Maura Shaw 's hands were clamped tightly to the steering wheel as she drove along Farewell Street , between the two graveyards at the foot of the bridge . She drew the first deep breath she 'd taken since leaving their house in Columbus early yesterday . She 'd finally gotten them here . <br> The trip from Ohio had taken longer than she 'd expected . Maura could n't help it : every car on the highway , every exit off the interstate , all potentially could be where she 'd find Carrie . She 'd driven carefully , eyes on the road . But one part of her attention , a big part , was spent darting over to the passing Dodge Ram , the young hitchhikers , the broken-down Chevy , the ambulance speeding in the opposite direction . <br> Carrie 's postcards had been from places out West . Santa Fe , New Mexico , had been the first ; Billings , Montana , was the last . But who was to say she might not have changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very same day her father died , having never purposely done one thing to make her parents fret or worry , who had never been anything less than sweet , reliable , and incredibly smart , might in fact be capable of changing direction and heading east instead . <br> So Maura and the two younger kids had spent one night in a Days Inn near Allentown , Pennsylvania . This was out of the way ; obsessing about Carrie , she 'd taken a wrong turn , and the kids had n't realized . Travis had been navigating , doing a great job , but after a while , assuming they were basically on autopilot , he 'd turned to text-messaging Ally on his cell phone . <br> Suddenly Maura had started seeing signs for Gettysburg  --  they were heading south instead of east . She almost panicked . She could n't let the kids know they were off course . Not because of pride or a need for infallibility , but because she wanted to give them a sense of safety , reassure them that she had it together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had become a teenage nihilist , who doubted all that was good , who had seemed to retreat into a world of cats and numbers , and expected only disaster of real life . <br> Maura had quietly adjusted course , off one exit and back on the other way , not telling the kids they had traveled fifty miles out of the way without her realizing , and trying to keep herself from <br> pondering the symbolism of driving straight toward one of the bloodiest battlefields in America while thinking of where her oldest daughter might be . <br> And here they were : The southern end of Aquidneck Island , Newport jutted into the Atlantic Ocean , and the sea was everywhere : down every alley , across every lawn , surrounding the city . She had come home to her New England roots , and in spite of everything , she felt a sudden surge of joy . She pressed the buttons to open all the car windows , ignoring the kids ' protests as their hair blew wildly . <br> Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
