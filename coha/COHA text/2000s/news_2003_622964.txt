<p> Chronicle Arts and Culture Critic Steven Winn 's two-part series on originality in the arts ( " Any bright ideas , " Jan. 9 and " Originality finds an ally in the past , " Jan. 10 ) elicited overwhelming response from Chronicle readers . Here is a selection of letters commenting on the series : <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Thanks very much to Steven Winn for his column on originality in the arts . It is a well-considered look at the state of our culture . I can imagine it must be disheartening to be an art critic at this time , as I know it is to be a serious and original artist . <p> It seems increasingly that the state of mainstream culture can be pretty squarely laid at the feet of the commodification of art . It 's all about the bottom line when it comes to judging the " success " of artists  --  and we all know how very adventurous and original this kind of value system is likely to make an artist anxious to be successful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose primary motivations are creation and communication and not commercial success , are largely excluded by a mainstream art world bought into the profit ethic . Art is defined for consumers as those creations produced within the boundaries set out by commercialism . This vicious circle produces the lack of originality and authenticity you pointed out . <p> It seems to me that the state of American art is a reflection of a much broader social , political and cultural malaise . And we ca n't expect our important and original artists to emerge from the shadows until we address those problems , though they will always go on creating in the shadows , made invisible by our indifference . <p> ANNE POIRIER <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  How can Steven Winn , while rightly deploring lack of originality , make an exception of Tony Kushner 's " Angels in America " ? ( " Any bright ideas ? " Jan 9 ) . It was self-referential in the suffocating narcissism of homosexuality 's perpetual adolescence . Too long at seven hours , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheapened by the culture of victimhood , as well as the abomination of political correctness . <p> At ACT that season , it was a relief to have this marathon excess followed by " Hecuba " by Euripides . This play also has as its subject large-scale human suffering , but its writing is pithy , evokes tragic catharsis and yet lasts less than a hour . <p> What Pound and Eliot , then Stoppard and Pynchon at the end of Winn 's spectrum , exhibit , and Kushner and company lack , is a deep knowledge and understanding of the history of their art form , and thus can paradoxically function originally within it . <p> It is easy to be different , but it is hard to get it right . <p> LEE HOPKINS <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I just read Steven Winn 's article " Any Bright Ideas " in The Chronicle and was intrigued because I just finished a book for my graphic design thesis project titled , " Revival . " I looked at the compressing rate of recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles over the last 70 years . I 'm actually in the process of pitching the book for publishing and thought he might be an interesting person to connect insights with . I made the same observations about Frank Gehry and just saw and loved " Adaptation . " <p> Winn is right in that everywhere you turn in contemporary culture , art is either self-referential or infused with sampling . Novelty is a clever reconfiguration of the past . <p> LAURA KRAMER <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  So much of that which is original is produced in side streams , issuing forth from the idiosyncratic perspective of outsiders . Today it is extremely difficult for any in the modern world to be sufficiently immersed in a unique culture , to be able to bring a new voice to the conversation . International yuppie culture has covered the upper-middle-class world like floodwaters and now threatens other strata as well . <p> This explains why the state of California has overtaken New York City as the center of cultural , social , technological and financial innovation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time frame beginning in the late 1950s and culminating with the peak of the dot-com boom in 2000 , California simply became the most important place in the world for new things . A self-regenerating side stream drawing fruits , nuts and flakes , along with tycoons , beauties and all manner of eccentric and extreme persons . . . . <p> WILLIAM EDWARD <p> SUMMERS <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I 'm loving the last two articles that explore originality . I 've long hungered for this kind of distilled perspective on both modernism and the flow of ideas in art . Thank you . <p> Two thoughts sprang up as I was reading . <p> One is around the emergent form of improvisational theater . Not stand-up comedy , but the practice of " making up everything as you go , " including the narrative , on a theatrical stage . <p> It 's a personal favorite ( I find both witnessing and practicing this art form thrilling ) , and because it emerged in its current ( and rapidly evolving ) form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems worthy of throwing in the originality discussion . <p> Have those who practice improvs tumbled upon something whose very essence is originality ? I sense it to be a profound part of the mix , and wonder if your much-better-informed mind has any perspective to add . <p> The second thought is something I always mull over when I run into anyone echoing Ezra Pound 's " make it new " charge . There 's almost a snobbery that emerges when someone learns both the history of art and is fairly schooled in their current culture , e.g. Pound or your typical Yale art school graduate . We think if it 's not new , it 's not worth doing . <p> I find this tired , for I believe that some of the " old " lessons that existing ( i.e. not new ) art have to teach are worth teaching again . Partly because we have n't " learned " them yet , but mainly because every human is " new , " i.e. we all just arrived on the planet , as relatively if not completely new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that some other artist , at some other time , already expressed does n't mean that the work might not have tremendous impact on a person encountering it for the first time . <p> If we were immortal beings , I could see the " make it new " dictum having import . But our immortality exists mainly in the sense that , and to the degree that , we become aware of history . . . . Many are n't , and those people ( myself included ) find encountering ideas , however old and revisited to the Pounds of the world , to be valid and valuable . <p> CORT WORTHINGTON <p> Owner , Illuminata Films <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Thank you very much for the insightful , intelligent two-part piece on originality in the arts . It put into words much of what I have been thinking about recently , and I admired your adroit connections between works in the fields of music , art , dance , film and literature . Lately , I have grown tired of the self-referential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become an overused " creative " crutch . <p> The Gerhard Richter show at SFMOMA reinforced my growing realization that one can indeed express a connection to history and tradition without being overly sentimental or guilty of regurgitation , and at the same time be original without being novel for novelty 's sake . Thank you , again , for these articles , which encouraged me to keep thinking and working along those lines . <p> TAMI STRANG <p> San Mateo <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Thanks so much for this . Steven Winn raised many of the problems that exist today . It is refreshing to see someone talk about how empty so much of our art has become . <p> I think the art establishment has sold out to its desire for money and popularity . So much controversial art is basically infantile rather than thought-provoking . So often cleverness substitutes for creativity . Words have taken over visual arts as the need to explain art pieces to enhance their sales-worthiness overwhelms what the artist may really want to say . <p> Like in some many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the product of formula instead of inspiration . <p> GARY CRONER <p> Berkeley <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I was greatly encouraged to read the two articles about the state of the arts in today 's culture . I have been trying to say as much in my RES magazine column for the last five years and have been fighting against it in my movies ever since " Northern Lights . " <p> It 's so important to make one distinction I get from your writing , between what is " new " and what is " original . " Museums have been thriving for years on the former . Artists of distinction now must deal only with the latter if we 're to escape the trivial , derivative clubhouse conviviality that makes careers but says nothing about human suffering ( or human joy for that matter . ) But more critics have to point this out in order to direct people away from today 's pop novelties and cartoon bromides parading fake significance . I think you do this in a very important way . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have faith that even if there is nothing truly unique , human DNA provides overwhelming and sometimes very tiny differentials , determinative tiny switches that turn on a Melville , a Cassavetes , a Tsai Ming Liang . . . or a bus driver who loves Shakespeare , or turn off a postmodernist who scoffs at them all . <p> ROB NILSSON <p> Berkeley
