The shuddering naked woman strung up in the meat locker was not the problem . Neither was the guy ripping through chains embedded in his flesh to dismantle a ticking bomb in front of him . What worried the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) when the ratings body screened Saw III , the latest installment in the lucrative , torture-based horror franchise , was the disturbing " tonality , " according to the film 's director , Darren Lynn Bousman . " This movie is too dark ? " asks Bousman , a 27-year-old Elvis Costello look-alike from Kansas . " That 's what I set out to do ! It 's a horror movie . " Before altering Saw III to garner a more box-office-friendly R-rating , Bousman called up another director who specializes in movies people watch through their fingers , Rob Zombie , the tattooed heavy-metal vocalist . " I told him to talk to the MPAA as a filmmaker , " says Zombie , 41 , whose depraved gorefest The Devil 's Rejects contains what many consider cinema 's most artful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to tell the story in a way that 's more socially responsible . " When pressed , Zombie admits he does n't actually care what 's socially responsible . He just wanted to help out a kindred spirit , another guy who understands the unique beauty of a properly lighted viscera shot . <P> Bousman and Zombie are both members of an emerging and collegial band of horror auteurs  --  unofficially known as the Splat Pack  --  who are given almost free rein and usually less than $10 million by studios or producers to make unapologetically disgusting , brutally violent movies . If they get it right , there 's a fervid fan base , composed mostly of people far too young to take death seriously , who will send those movies into almost gruesome profitability ( some of the films have made more than $100 million ) . The group is loose knit , and other members include the director of the first Saw movie , James Wan , and his co-writer , Leigh Whannell ; Hostel writer-director Eli Roth ; The Descent 's Neil Marshall ; and Alexandre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Hills Have Eyes . <P> The gore-happy gang owes a lot of its recent good fortune to Whannell and Wan , who ushered in the latest iteration of big-screen bloodlust with the first Saw movie in 2004 , just as eerie Japanese horror movies like The Ring were peaking . Whannell was a Melbourne , Australia , TV host who thought he had a brain tumor . His film-school buddy , Wan , was unemployed . " I would have done anything to be healthy again , " says Whannell , now 29 , who , it turned out , was actually just suffering from stress headaches . When he felt better , he wrote the script for Saw , in which a terminally ill cancer patient , Jigsawultimately played in all three movies by the creepy character actor Tobin Bellforces people to consider what they 're prepared to do to stay alive . Using $7,000 of Whannell 's savings , the pair shot a shocking 10-min. film in which Whannell played one of Jigsaw 's victims who has to dig a key from the digestive tract of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open by a reverse bear trap . On the strength of that short , Los Angeles  --  based Evolution Entertainment ponied up $1.2 million to make a feature . The sets were grungy  --  most of the film takes place in a dirty bathroom  --  and the actors , Danny Glover and Carey Elwes , were n't too expensive . Wan got to direct , and Whannell starred as another of Jigsaw 's victims .
