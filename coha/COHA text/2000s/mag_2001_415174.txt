OUTFITTING Headnote TRAIL-TESTED GEAR Headnote Plus a bargain of a tent , hand-hugging hiking poles , a technical kilt , and more // I scanned the pile of gear and food spread out on the ground and winced . A buddy and I were heading into Wyoming 's Teton Range for 5 days , and the anticipated load made my back hurt : ice axe , climbing rope and hardware , helmet , camping gear , and just enough food to keep us from finding out whether marmots taste like chicken . Then I looked at my pack , which I 'd used just twice , and hoped it would be gentle with me . As it turned out , I carried two packs into the Tetons . Why do such a seemingly foolish thing , when I was already concerned about weight ? Because I was carrying The Works and only one frame . Let me explain . The Works at Mystery Ranch is a modular system of eight interchangeable packbags and one harness called the Wrap Frame . The Wrap Frame comes in four men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity from the 1,600-cubicinch SnowZen to the 7,400-cubic-inch A7000 long , which expands to nearly 7,900 cubic inches . Four sizes are suited to backpacking : the A7000 , which also comes in a short size at 7,000 cubic inches ; the 5,600-cubic-inch short and 6,000cubic-inch long Alpacka ; the Jazz , which comes in a 4,800-cubic-inch short and a 5,000-cubic-inch long packbag ; and the 4,200-cubic-inch Blues . Conceived by Dana Gleason , legendary pack maker and founder of Dana Design , The Works system employs quick clips and hook-and-loop attachments to join the Wrap Frame to each packbag . All but the two smallest packbags also use a fiberglass rod running the length of the frame that feeds into a sewn sleeve on the packbag , transferring weight to the hips and maintaining the shape of the frame and packbag . I found assembling the pack easy after I spent 15 minutes with the instruction booklet , but I also called Gleason , who offered a few tips . Once I mastered the system , it took me about 3 minutes to swap packbags . ( Note : Mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fitting it . ) In the Tetons , I used the short Alpacka to carry bulk gear to our base camp , then switched to the 2,900-cubicinch Longhorn to carry food and gear for 1-day climbs . The Alpacka swallowed everything I stuffed into it , including both tent and rainfly . The Longhorn , a rucksack-style top-loader , was big enough for long , gear-intensive daytrips . I also later backpacked for 2 days in Utah 's Capitol Reef National Park and 3 days in New Hampshire 's White Mountains using the 4,200-cubic-inch Blues packbag , whinch had ample capacity for those shorter trips . With a load of 35 to 40 pounds , the Blues carried quite comfortably . But a 60plus-pound load in the Alpacka left my hips sore at day 's end . When I scrambled over the huge boulders of Garnet Canyon in the Tetons , the Alpacka shifted a bit . In my opinion , the Wrap Frame , harness , and hipbelt on these models are best suited to moderate loads for weekend to weeklong trips . Beyond choosing among four frame sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customize its fit to your torso . The Wrap Frame comes with a removable lumbar pad so that you can streamline the system for use with the smaller packbags . The packbags boast basic , functional features . Each of the two smallest has a pocket for a 100-ounce hydration bladder . Each of the larger packs-the A7000 , Blues , Jazz , and Alpacka-has two such pockets , plus a vertical zipper to access the main compartment , two large exterior pockets on the back , two lid pockets , and exterior sleeping pad straps . Internal and external compression straps keep the contents from shifting . The pack fabric is a blend of 500denier and 1,000-denier Cordura nylon , which took a beating ( I once lowered the Alpacka on a rope down 40 feet of wet ledges in the Tetons ) without any signs of wear and tear . An exterior Teflon coating and interior polyurethane coating make the Cordura waterproof . The Works at Mystery Ranch frames and packbags are not featherweights . With the frame , the Blues tips BACKPACKER 's scales at 6 pounds 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 ounces . The Blues and Alpacka also rank among the pricier packs in their size range , although they are quite comfortable . Contact : The Works at Mystery Ranch , ( 406 ) 388-4550 ; www.mysteryranch.com .
