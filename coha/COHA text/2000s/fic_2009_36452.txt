One <p> Dan Swansea came awake in the darkness , not knowing for a minute who he was or where . He lifted one hand to his head and groaned when it came away sticky with blood . Slowly ( or at least it felt that way ) , things returned to him . His name . That he was outside in a parking lot , on his back in the gravel , and he was freezing . Also , except for his shoes and socks , he was naked . <p> He sat up , his stomach roiling as a wave of pain swept through him , and wiped his head again , flicking drops of blood onto the gravel . He 'd followed a girl out here . A girl  --  her name was on the tip of his tongue , but he could n't quite get it . A high school girl , an old classmate , with flashing white teeth and red soles on her shoes . Come to my car , she 'd whispered . It 's warm . They 'd kissed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , her mouth fiery underneath his , their breath steaming in the blackness , until she pushed him away . Take off your clothes , she 'd said . I want to see you . It 's freezing ! he 'd protested , but his hands were already working at the buttons of his shirt and the clasp of his belt , because it was cold but she was hot , and he was n't passing this up . No way . He 'd squirmed out of his clothes , kicking his pants off over his shoes , dropping each garment in a pile on the gravel , and when he looked up , naked and shivering in the cold , one hand cupping his cock , she was pointing something at him . His heart stopped  --  a gun ?  --  but almost before he 'd thought the word , he saw that it was n't a gun but a cell phone . <p> The flash was brilliant , blinding him as she snapped a picture . Hey ! he shouted . What the fuck ? <p> See how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like it when they 're laughing at you . <p> He 'd lunged for her , trying to snatch the phone . What is your problem ? <p> What 's my problem ? she 'd answered , dancing backward on her red-soled shoes . You 're my problem . You ruined my life ! <p> She dived into the car , slamming the door before he could grab the handle . The engine roared to life . He 'd jumped in front of her , thinking she 'd stop , but judging from the cuts on his side and the terrible sick throbbing in his head , maybe she had n't . <p> He groaned again , pushed himself upright , and peered at the country club , which was empty and locked . Through the darkness , he could see the tennis courts off to one side , the golf course behind the building , the sheds and outbuildings underneath a stand of pine trees a discreet distance from the club proper . Clothes first , he decided , and stumbled painfully toward the nearest building . Clothes first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weiner , Inc . <br> Continues ...
