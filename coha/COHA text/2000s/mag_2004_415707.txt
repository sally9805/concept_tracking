Do you overdo Advil ? Buy drugs online ? Read on for info about how bad these moves and others really are . BY LAUREN PICKER // Three weeks after giving birth , Lisa Bova developed a urinary tract infection . The 36-year-old first-time mom called her ob/gyn , who prescribed an antibiotic called Macrobid . Before taking it , Bova scanned the pharmacy inserts only to stumble upon an alarming fact : The drug is not recommended for women who are breast-feeding . Since she was , in fact , nursing her newborn , she immediately called the pharmacist , who told her Macrobid could cause an adverse reaction in babies younger than 1 month old . " My obstetrician had just delivered my son , and I reminded her on the phone that I was breastfeeding him , so I could n't believe that she missed it , " Bova says . Fortunately , she caught the error before the medication put her baby at risk . But the experience " was an eye-opener , " she says . As Bova 's close call shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drug errors account for 7,000 deaths in the United States each year . " That figure is low because it only includes cases in which hospitals listed drug error on the death certificate , " explains Michael R. Cohen , president of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in Philadelphia . Tally up the less tragic outcomes , and medicine mistakes affect hundreds of themsands of us each year : The U.S. Pharmacopeia-which tracks errors at more than 600 of the nation 's 6,000 hospitals-received 192,477 voluntary reports of drug errors in 2002 ( the most recent year for which statistics are available ) . It sounds scary , but there 's no need to panic . The good news is " these mistakes are absolutely preventable , " says Cohen . Here , Redbook spells out the most common medicine mess-ups , and the steps you can take to safeguard your health : Medicine mistake #1 You ca n't read your doctor 's handwriting on the prescription . If you ca n't decipher it , your pharmacist may not be able to either . End result : Yon could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ph.D. , dean of the University of Arizona 's College of Pharmacy in Tucson . Doctors ' rushed scribble is " a major source of error , " Bootman says . It 's easy for a pharmacist to interpret a barely legible prescription for , say , Celexa ( for depression ) for Celebrex ( for arthritis ) . How easy ? One-quarter of the drug errors reported to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices relate to names that look alike or sound alike . To help protect you from this sort of screwup , the FDA is now requiring the drug industry to use a mix of upper- and lower-case letters-such as vinBLAStine or vinCRIStine-to highlight differences in similar names . And a growing number of doctors are sidestepping the problem altogether by prescribing electronically , sending the prescription via computer directly to the pharmacy , says Bootman. * Your Safest Rx : Ask your doctor to spell out the name of the drug and jot it down so you can double-check it later . Also , have him write the reason for the medication right on the prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same purpose , so this increases the chances that your pharmacist will get it right , " advises Cohen . Medicine mistake #2 You unknowingly take double or even triple the painkiller dose . You have a miserable cold and your head is pounding . So every four hours you pop a couple of extra-strength tablets of acetaminophen ( a.k.a . Tylenol ) for your headache and an all-purpose cold medicine to relieve your other symptoms . Warning : If that cold remedy is one of the many out there containing acetaminophen , " by the end of the day , you 'll be dangerously close to a toxic dose , " says Timothy Tracy , Ph.D. , professor of experimental and clinical pharmacology at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy . In fact , the equivalent of 15 extra-strength tablets in a day can damage your liver . Consume three or four alcoholic drinks at the same time , and half that much acetaminophen does the damage . Overdoing ibuprofen ( Advil ) can also be hazardous to your health . Taking it round-the-clock for several weeks straight can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safest Rx : The easiest way to avoid accidentally doubling up is to steer clear of multipurpose products when you are taking OTC painkillers . Medicine mistake #3 You leave the pharmacy without confirming that this is X drug for Y condition . As you pick up your prescription , you dutifully sign your name . You may think you 're simply acknowledging receipt of the drug , but " you 're actually signing away your right to go over the prescription with a pharmacist , " says Cohen . Bad idea . " A study by IMS Health found that 2 to 5 percent of the 3.4 million prescriptions filled last year contained mistakes , " says Carmen Catizone , executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy in Park Ridge , Illinois . They 're mistakes that could be caught in a face-to-face with your pharmacist . * Your Safest Rx : " Choose your pharmacist as carefully as you choose your doctor , " says Bootman . And pick one pharmacy and stick with it , so they have a record of everything you 're taking-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each prescription-what it 's for , how you should take it , what it interacts with . And tell your pharmacist what OTC drugs , supplements , and herbal remedies you 're using . In other words , become an active partner with your pharmacist : If you have any doubts about a drug , do n't just swallow them-ask questions . Fortunately , many pharmacies are now using computer software that flags dangerous doses and potential drug interactions . To see if yours does , ask , " What checks do you have in place to prevent errors and drug interactions ? " Medicine mistake #4 You do n't tell your doctor about your herbal remedies . Scared to tell your old-school doctor about the new-age treatments you 've been taking ? You 're not the only one . A recent study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that 59 percent of women use herbal supplements-and almost none of us admit it to our doctors . Herbal treatments can interact with both other herbals and traditional drugs , reducing their effectiveness and/or causing unexpected side effects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may undercut the Pill 's success rate , and it has been shown to increase breakthrough bleeding . * Your Safest Rx : Keep your physician in the loop about all your alternative treatments-from the echinacea you pop when yon feel a cold coming on to your PMS-busting vitamin . Better yet : Bring the herbal medication into the doctor 's office , so she can scan the label for red-flag ingredients . Medicine mistake #5 You self-treat with someone else 's prescription . You break out in a rash , so you dab on some of that cream the doctor had prescribed for your husband 's skin problem . Guess what ? You 've just committed a whopper of a health sin . " Even if your condition looks the same as someone else 's , you could have two different problems , " says Tracy . " Often , only a doctor can tell the difference . " Your husband 's rash may have been viral , whereas yours could be bacterial and in need of an antibiotic . And while you 're self-treating with his leftover prescription , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with playing doctor : Even if you happen to self-medicate with the correct drug , some prescriptions are based on age and weight , so using someone else 's medication may be too strong or weak a dose for your body , meaning you could get a dangerous-or worthless-amount of it . * Your Safest Rx : Eliminate the temptation : Never save leftover prescription medication . Once you ( or your husband or child ) is over that illness , file that vial where it belongs-in the trash . Medicine mistake #6 You ignore the label and take your medicine with ( or without ) food . Does it really matter that you take your antibiotic or other medicine with ( or without ) food , as the label suggests ? Actually , it does . Food helps your body absorb some medications-but prevents it from getting enough of others . And certain foods prevent drugs from doing their job . For example , if you down the commonly prescribed antibiotic tetracycline with milk , you might as well be taking a sugar pill . " Dairy products bind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , " explains Tracy . Another example : Taking the asthma medication Theo-24 with a high-fat meal , such as bacon and eggs , will double or triple the drug 's concentration , which can lead to irregular heartbeat or seizures , says Tracy . * Your Safest Rx : Before beginning a new prescription , ask your pharmacist for a patient information leaflet , which is available for most medications . At the very least , take the extra 30 seconds to read that little sticker on the bottle . If you have a seemingly silly question ( like , " Does an iced latte count as a dairy product ? " ) , do n't be afraid to ask your pharmacist . Medicine mistake #7 You think that just because a medicine is " natural , " it 's safe . " People assume that because a product is natural , it ca n't harm you , " says Catizone . " That 's not true . " As you probably know , in early 2004 , ephedra was banned by the FDA after being linked to 155 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta issued a warning about East Indian ayurvedic medicine , after 12 people who tried it developed lead poisoning . Here 's the problem with going alternative : Unlike traditional meds , the FDA does not regulate herbal remedies and supplements , so there 's no guarantee that they 're safe or effective . Worse still , " there 's no way to know for sure if the product you 're buying actually contains enough , too much , or any of the active ingredients , " says Tracy , so even somewhat innocuous or " safe " products , like ginseng , are not risk-free. * Your Safest Rx : Research that herbal remedy carefully . To find out if your alternative treatment is backed by legit research , you can check out the National Institutes of Health 's website ( nccam.nih.gov/health ) . And to find out if you 're getting what you paid for , consult ConsumerLabs.com , a website that provides independent test results and consumer information about alternative products . Medicine mistake #8 You save money by buying prescription drugs online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast prescription drugs-from antidepressants to antibiotics ? Sure the prices are good , but buying medications online from overseas sources is not only illegal , it can cost you in unexpected ways . For starters , you have no idea what you 're getting . As with herbal remedies , " drugs from overseas are not regulated by the FDA , so the drug could have more active ingredients than it should , or less-or no active ingredients at all , " notes Catizone . And do n't be reassured by online pharmacies that claim to be based in Canada , where drug safety regulations are similar to ours . " There 's no way of knowing where these products are really coming from , " says Catizone . In July , the FDA issued a warning because the generic versions of three common prescription drvigs-Viagra , Lipitor , and Ambien-they purchased via a website advertised as Canadian were not only not from Canada , but they were also substandard and potentially dangerous . * Your Safest Rx : Buyer beware . If you choose to purchase meds online , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharmacy ( nabp.net ) to determine whether a website is a reputable , licensed pharmacy . Do n't buy from foreign websites , or sites that will sell a prescription drug without a prescription from your doctor-filling out an online questionnaire is no substitute , ever .
