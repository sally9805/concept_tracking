<p> SANTA lay in a heap next to his reindeer . <p> A cold front brought 45-mile-per-hour gusts , knocking the air out of Kris Kringle and 700 other inflatables at Airblown World in Grand Prairie south of Dallas . <p> " Rain we can take , wind we ca n't , " said Grand Prairie marketing director Amy Sprinkles of the new drive-through holiday theme park of inflatable displays . <p> Made of nylon fabric and plastic , the cast of inflatables - Winnie the Pooh , Santa and Ruldoph - were being ripped apart by howling winds . To prevent further damage , Grand Prairie park officials pulled the electric plug and deflated the air-pumped characters along the wooded three-mile stretch . <p> But Mother Nature could n't keep Santa down . The next day , the big jolly guy was full of air again . <p> The good news has Jason Jones charged . The salesman plans to fly 219 miles to view the display . He has 400 inflatables of his own at home in Oklahoma . He also founded the Airblown Inflatables Collectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as the 29-year-old is concerned , fiber-optic reindeers and plastic snowmen are so last year . This season , people are pumped about all things inflatable . <p> Selling for $20-$200 , inflatables are this season 's must-have icons . And they 're everywhere . In people 's yards . At carwashes , grocery stores . Atop restaurants . <p> " They 're the new form of holiday decorating , " Jones declared . " They 're larger than life , and the craze has taken over the country . " <p> Lupe Tortilla on the Southwest Freeway has Santa flashing a happy holidays sign from its rooftop . <p> An 8-foot-tall snow globe with Frosty is the first thing customers see when they step inside Nundini Food Store on North Shepherd . <p> But inflatables are not just for the holidays . Hoping to inflate sales , area businesses use them year-round to attract passers-by . <p> An American eagle with red , white and blue feathers perches above Landmark cars on Interstate 45 . <p> The hulky inflatable body-builder with sunglasses and dumbbells on Busy Body Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's the idea - to be visible , " store manager Justin Russell said . " We 're located in a high-traffic area . You 're pretty focused on the road , so we needed something to attract attention . " <p> When Texas Boys Balloons owner Dallas Foster started renting 25-foot-plus inflatables to car dealerships , restaurants and banks three years ago , his inventory consisted of five blow-ups . Today , he has 100 , with half rented out for the holidays to lure in gift-minded shoppers . <p> " This is shopping season , " Foster said . " You know what they say , When times are good , you should advertise . And when times are bad , you need to advertise . ' " <p> Many of Foster 's clients are auto dealers . Santa climbing down the chimney is a popular pick right now , but usually they go ape for gorillas in either pink or purple . <p> It was a giant gorilla inflatable at a car lot that inspired the executives at Dallas-based Gemmy Industries to create the inflatables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorilla , " recalled vice-president Jason McCann , " and we asked , How can we turn this into a snowman or pumpkin ? ' It took off from there . " <p> Gemmy claimed it launched the holiday inflatable category in 2001 with a snowman and Santa . Sales soared , and today , the company boasts 500 characters , including Mickey Mouse , the Simpsons , SpongeBob and Snoopy . And not just at Christmastime , but every holiday from Halloween to the Fourth of July . <p> Available at Costco , Target , Walgreens , Wal-Mart and Garden Ridge stores , privately owned Gemmy would n't divulge how many inflatables it has sold . " But it 's millions , " McCann said . <p> And climbing with its latest inflatable category : snow globes . <p> Self-inflated with a built-in pump and filled with Styrofoam pellets raging inside like a snowstorm , the globes are selling out - fast . <p> " We had already sold 60 percent of our inventory before Thanksgiving . That 's huge , " said Tom Stinson , vice-president of Houston-based Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , but Gemmy had already sold out of the globes . <p> " We 're done , " McCann said . " We 're done making them until next year . " <p> New holiday characters and themes will be introduced next season , making this year 's snow globes and inflatables highly collectible . <p> Take the 6-foot-tall snow globe with Snoopy and Charlie Brown . It 's available only at selected Sears outlets . <p> " It 's really hard to find , " Jones said . " It retails for about $170 . On eBay , it 's selling for a lot more . " <p> Last week , a bidder shelled out $243 for the Peanuts Christmas globe . <p> " I have a Shrek Christmas prototype I purchased for $200 , " Jones said . " I was offered $300 for it , but I 'm not selling . It 's going in my yard , close to the front door . " <p> Houstonian Michael Whitemyer has been collecting inflatables for a couple of years . Currently , he has an 8-foot-tall snow globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I buy every one of them every season , " the hairdresser said . " I had a pink egg in the yard for Easter . In the summer , I go tropical with palm trees . They give a lot of bang for the buck . I just plug them in and I 'm done decorating . " <p> Inflatables are n't just for decorations . Moonwalklike play structures with billowy slides and obstacle courses have birthday celebrants bouncing off the walls . <p> " Inflatable moonbounces are all the rage right now with kids , " Houston mom Valerie Harrison said . <p> A 13-by-13-foot moonwalk rents for about $85 . The price includes delivery , set up , pick-up and about four hours of nonstop playtime . <p> " The moonwalk business has really picked up , " said Debbie Passmore , owner of Boink Bouncies in northwest Houston . " Moonwalks are n't just square things anymore . They have characters that you can build a whole party around . My carousel is fairly popular . It has a big top like the circus and horses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party away from home , indoor facilities with inflatable play equipment are popping up all over town , including Bounce U , Original Bounce N Party and Pump It Up . <p> " The kids are so excited to have a birthday party , and their guests are so excited to be at the party , " Harrison said . " Do you want all that energy at your house ? " <p> Not this mother of two . Last weekend , she celebrated her 5-year-old 's birthday at Pump It Up , a playground with air-filled obstacle courses and 20-foot slides . <p> " It took a lot of weight off my shoulders to not worry about the activities and decorations , " she said . " You just show up with your kids and let them bounce to exhaustion . " <p> But the best part comes at the end . <p> " There 's no cleanup , " Harrison said . " You get in your car and go home . " <p> Five years ago , founder Brenda Dronkers got the idea for Pump It Up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonwalk got moved indoors . <p> Already with 110 outlets nationwide , the California-based franchise plans to open another 100 locations next year .

" It 's not a question of if they 're going to have a party here but a matter of when . I compare this to the merry-go-round concept .
