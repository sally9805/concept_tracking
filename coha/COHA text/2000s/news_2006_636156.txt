<p> Ron Howard 's little girl is not a Paris , a Lindsay or a Nicole . Bryce Dallas Howard is not the type to be seen at the clubs shuffling a new guy-of-the-week while wearing a low-cut designer number . <p> In fact , the 25-year-old actress is nothing if not modest and demure . Just listen to her tell a story about filming director M. Night Shyamalan 's newest horror flick , " Lady in the Water , where Howard plays an always-drenched sea creature . <p> " We shot at a warehouse in New Jersey and there were a lot of male workers in the complex next door , " she says . " I 'm not sure if they were construction workers or not , but they were very masculine men . <p> " And then there was me  --  the girl walking out in a wet , white T-shirt every single day to play a sea creature . It was my worst nightmare . " <p> Flaunting it is not exactly part of her makeup although Howard does spend a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the floor ( sea creatures ca n't dry out ) .

" <p> The Howards ( director Ron and wife of 30-plus years Cheryl ) must be doing something right because Hollywood 's attentions have shifted toward the nice girl . <p> She plays Spiderman 's newest love interest in " Spider-Man 3 . " That she snagged the plum role does n't come as a complete surprise ; many in Hollywood have been watching Howard 's rise for the last few years . <p> " It 's no wonder there is so much interest in Bryce . She is so open as a person . You see that the first time you meet her and figure she can only be more open as an actor , " says Paul Giamatti , who plays her protector in " Lady in the Water , " which opens Friday . <p> " What I found is that she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

This is not a responsibility that Howard takes lightly . <p> " I consider this movie a big responsibility , " she says . " The most important thing for me was knowing children would be seeing it and maybe they would use this character as a moral guide . She has a message about life . " <p> Howard does n't mind spilling the beans . <p> " The message of this lady in the water is that if you have faith then all that is meant to be will happen . " <p> " Lady in the Water " marks Howard 's second outing with Shyamalan , who cast her as a blind girl who must find life on the outside of her strange digs in " The Village .

" During the end of the film , all of the polite small talk had finally dissipated . " <p> Howard learned that Night " is a very meticulous filmmaker . He really knows what he 's doing and the stories really come from deep inside of him . He looks at the actors like we 're vessels to tell his story , but he 's the one with the vision and the intentions . " <p> " All I had to do is release myself to his vision , " Howard says . My job was to be on point and make the right decisions for him .

" He would say , ' Bryce , just relax . Look things over . And you 'll find the right path .
