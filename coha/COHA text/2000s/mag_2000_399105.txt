Section : Companies , People , Ideas <p> Cablevision Systems Chief Executive James Dolan never objected to the comfort of his legendary father 's shadow . If that means others underestimate him , all the better . <p> JAMES DOLAN , 43 , IS CHIEF EXECUTIVE of $3.3 billion Cablevision Systems but he brings with him certain , shall we say , baggage . For one thing , his father , Charles Dolan , is commonly referred to as the " visionary , legendary " founder of Cablevision . Try stepping into those adjectives . <p> And then there 's the younger Dolan 's resume , a document that just sparkles with items you 'd want to hide from the personnel department . College-hopper a handful of times . Alcohol problems ( one month in rehab ) . Work experience includes tree-trimmer and warehouse sweeper . Personal habits : If granted permission , he happily puffs away in the office . Recent accomplishment : bumbling presentation at a Merrill Lynch conference . <p> So if all this has conspired to make the gravel-voiced Dolan less than respected among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But maybe it 's time to give this guy a break . In the four years he 's been running Cablevision he 's pushed some tough , if against-the-grain , decisions that just may work out for the company . He 's pushing hard to convince the world of the values of broadband , where consumers will get all sorts of digital programming . While other cable operators are trying to go national , he 's selling off systems to focus exclusively on the New York area . To intertwine his company with New York , he 's bought everything from a local electronics retailer to the Knicks basketball team . <p> No respect ? That 's fine with him . " You want someone to underestimate you , " he says bravely . " You get more flexibility of movement . " Dolan seems secure with who he is and what he stands for . He can confidently refer to his father , Charles ( Chuck ) , 73 , in conversation as " Dad " without worrying that it is demeaning to his own authority , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trump card : " When we want to participate in a deal at a certain level , you have to get your father to call . " He knows that many in the industry think his dad , who is chairman , is running the show , but he feels that he accomplishes more when the limelight 's not on him . Plus , so what if dad wants to come in to work every day . Who better to learn from ? <p> Indeed . Father Charles founded the company in 1973 after selling Home Box Office to Time Warner and using some of the proceeds to buy a 1,500-subscriber cable system in Long Island . It is now the seventh-largest cabler , with 3.4 million households primarily in the New York metropolitan area . The company owns Madison Square Garden and a majority stake in Rainbow Media , which owns programming assets like Bravo and AMC . <p> Not an easy shadow to grow up in . One of six children , James grew up in a thoroughly middle-class Long Island suburb . James started getting rebellious as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he readily admits , he finally graduated from SUNY , New Paltz , with a major in communications . He worked part-time for Dad 's company throughout his teens in every capacity . " They gave me every lousy job known to man , " he says . " When I was in my rebellious stage from 18 to 20 it was like , ' let 's see what we can give the kid this time . ' " At 21 he decided to give the company five years to see if he liked it . He later gave himself an extension to ten years , then gave himself another . <p> But the younger Dolan was an unknown in an industry that happened to be run by powerful fathers , like Ralph J. Roberts of Comcast . He smiles at the memories of anonymously attending cable trade shows as a youngster and asking competitors questions . " No one had a clue who I was , " he marvels . " I would stand in elevators and people would talk in front of me . " <p> Industry execs still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dismissed him as the spoiled son of a visionary founder . It did n't help that he struggled with alcohol , which he talks about openly . " I learned a lot of things , the most important of which was that I am who I am , " he says . " I do n't want to be anyone else other than me . " <p> Early in his career Dolan strove to make his mark on the company . He talks about how in the early 1980s , for example , he started an advertising sales division , significant for a company and industry that included a " no commercials policy " as a selling point . When he left the division in 1991 , sales were $100 million . <p> Dolan has no problem going against his brethren . He would rather go the other way in an industry that runs like a wolf pack through trends . " We were always the outsider , " says Dolan about his company , which was never included in cable industry consortiums like satellite-programmer Primestar . <p> Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators are spending billions to build fat broadband pipes to homes to provide Internet access and telephone and video service . Internet service providers like AOL are screaming to get access to offer their content . So far most cablers see no reason to give the access away . Dolan is less interested in fighting open access and more interested in getting potential revenues from AOL subscribers . Not a popular opinion , surely , but perhaps a sage one . <p> If HBO was Dad 's legacy , Dolan wants his to be broadband . And his approach here is also different from the rest of the industry 's . He knows it will be tough to convince people to sign up for digital broadband service , which promises things like Web-related services , interactive games and video on demand , through a set-top cable box . <p> Others in the industry want to slowly break their customers into broadband with what he calls " a migration theory "  --  under which the company seeks customers door-by-door , charging $70 or so for a more advanced box . Dolan instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even giving them away . ( Sony recently agreed to sell its set-tops to Cablevision . ) Dolan sees his subscribers starting to get the boxes by the end of next year . <p> Dolan 's most controversial strategy is " clustering . " While others are consolidating , Cablevision is shedding systems nationwide to concentrate only in New York . Systems in Boston , Cleveland and Kalamazoo are on the block . Industry gossips speculate that the younger Dolan was moving against the wishes of his father , who was part of a generation of empire-builders . As recently as 1996 Cablevision was the fifth-largest cable system , with a presence in 19 states . But , by concentrating in New York , Dolan is looking for depth and deep pockets and has actually picked up more subscribers . Their subscribers spend $44 per month on average , versus $40 for the rest of the country 's subscribers . By owning these customers Dolan can get economies of scale in advertising and in the dispatching of repair trucks . <p> Not to mention the value of having such a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local electronics retailer Nobody Beats the Wiz . Dolan held firm . " Everyone looked at me with three eyes , " he says . It cost Cablevision $100 million  --  a song considering the chain took in $600 million in revenue last year . Upside is that now 30 million customers a year walk through the doors of the Wiz ( renamed and given a face-lift ) , giving Cablevision an already established and accepted retail brand . Now Cablevision has a place to show off its new broadband modems , as well as show the public it does more than take complaints about poor cable service . <p> To an extent , the same thinking went into his decision to spend $240 million to buy local movie theaters . He saw it as a place to further spread the Cablevision name and as a way to sell retail products . In addition Dolan has boosted Cablevision 's ownership of other New York properties as a way to further integrate the company with the city . No reason why he ca n't sell a Knicks jersey in the movie theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City 's Christmas spectacular . <p> Dolan 's strategy is turning Cablevision into a compact , tightly focused machine  --  in other words , maybe takeover bait ? Its stock , like other cable operators ' , has soared in the last few years , to $67 . But it does n't look like this Dolan is a seller . " I do n't have a need to be any wealthier . We are wealthy enough , " says Dolan , whose family 's worth is about $3 billion . " Wealth is just a measure of success . It 's not about competing with my father . My reward is running the company . How many people get to do this stuff ? " <p> One too many , as his detractors see it . Recently , at the reopening of Radio City Music Hall , Dolan helped launch a research foundation in honor of Cablevision Vice Chairman Marc Lustgarten , who had died of pancreatic cancer . The chitchat days afterward centered on how Dolan would fare without his beloved mentor and almost second father . Fair enough question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> GRAPHS : Look , Wall Street , I Did n't Bankrupt the Company . Sure , it 's been halcyon days for the cable industry as a whole . Everyone sees gold in its broadband pipes . But even skeptics give Dolan some credit for Cablevision . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Using their base of New York assets , like Radio City Music Hall , james and Charles Dolan are choreographing a focused strategy . <p> By Caroline Waxler <p>
