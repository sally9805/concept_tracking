OLD MISSUS 2004 Something was up . From the hallway outside her bedroom she heard the words Old Missus murmured -- or possibly they were shouted ; her ears were sharp for a ninety-year-old , but even she could n't hear through thick pine doors the way she used to . For a moment she contemplated protesting . Essie , who had been her housekeeper , cook , and general factotum -- for , was it twelve years now ?  - -  knew that using the hated Old Missus title was a call to arms , even if the sweet young thing Essie had just hired did not . Sharp words were called for . But it would take energy to deliver them . And one had to be careful how one spent that precious commodity at her age . Besides , she was n't sure she wanted her faithful retainers to know exactly how much of the conversations that swirled around her she managed to pick up . Eavesdropping was one of her main pleasures -- there were so few left . She hoisted herself out of bed as quickly as ninety-year-old joints would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyeglasses , and medications -- that now made up the whole of " Old Missus . " Twenty minutes later , she climbed back into bed . There were additional rustlings and murmurings in the hall , and the sweet young thing entered with a breakfast tray . She had initially balked at hiring the child , whose name was Cherry and whose job description was companion/helper . But Essie had put it in terms she could n't fight . " I ca n't keep up with this big old barn of a house on my own , and you ca n't go on living in it all by yourself , " she 'd said . " I ai n't coming in some morning to find you dead in your bed or lying on the bathroom floor with your other hip broken . You let me get someone in here to sleep through the night , or I quit . " So now young Cherry was standing in the doorway , holding the breakfast tray and wearing a fond if slightly patronizing grin . " The Charles Valley Gazette is here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of good news , the child could call her Old Missus or Old Mushroom , she did n't give a damn . " Give it here , " she said eagerly . The Charles Valley Gazette was supposed to be a weekly paper , but it had n't come for two months , and she had missed it desperately . The Cherry child carried the tray full of clanking china and cutlery across the room with the concentration of a tightrope walker . Breakfast in bed was an indulgence Old Missus had started allowing herself lately , but she still cringed slightly when it appeared . The girl finally came to a shaky halt at her bedside . " The paper was in your mailbox down at the post office yesterday , " she announced . " They must have sent it out from Charles Valley last week . " " Probably . I 'll take it now , Cherry . " " Where is Charles Valley ? " " Lawson County . May I have my newspaper , please ? " But the girl was n't through cogitating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " Silently , by reflex , she added , God forbid ! Although by now it probably would n't matter how close she got to Charles Valley . She could march down the main street of the town shouting out her life 's story over a bullhorn . No one was still alive who could possibly care . Or would they ? " Why do you get a newspaper from a town that 's miles away ? " her new helper asked , breaking into her thoughts . Clearly , they were making sweet young things much sharper than they used to . " I mean , it 's not like there are any stories in it about the whole state or the country or anything but Charles Valley . You could n't even buy any of the stuff in the ads over here . " It is never easy to pull yourself up to your full height while fighting bedclothes , but she did n't get to be Old Missus for nothing . " Cherry , dear , I want my breakfast before it congeals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone , but it came out cranky-old-lady . These days that seemed to happen a lot . The Cherry child settled the tray over her midsection and helped her adjust her pillows . The Gazette was under the bowl of oatmeal that her enthusiastic young doctor said was a real heart saver . What the hell the boy was saving that aged organ for was anyone 's guess . She pulled the paper out from under the bowl and positioned herself under the fancy new natural-light lamp she 'd allowed Essie to put on her night table . She 'd insisted she did n't need the damn thing , but the truth was it did make the small print easier . And the print used by most newspapers , including the Charles Valley Gazette , was infinitesimal . She should start a lawsuit on behalf of elderly Americans across the country being driven mad as they attempted to stay informed . As usual , the first thing she did was look through the newspaper 's table of contents for articles written by Laurel Selene McCready . For the past seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masthead as the assistant to the editor , Hank Barlow , although she also did double duty as a writer . But about three months ago her name had disappeared , after which there was no newspaper for two weeks . When it appeared again , a new assistant was listed on the masthead ; soon that name was gone and two others appeared and disappeared in rapid succession . And the arrival of the Gazette , which had been a regular feature of Old Missus ' Saturdays , suddenly became a random event . Sometimes it showed up on Tuesday , sometimes on Friday -- if it showed up at all . Clearly , the loss of Ms. McCready was a major catastrophe for the paper . And not just because of whatever she had done to make sure it was published each week . Since her disappearance , the damn thing was loaded with typos . But in the humble opinion of Old Missus , it was Laurel Selene 's writing that was the biggest loss . The absent Ms. McCready had had a nice way with a phrase and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and welcome tartness . They were better than the swill turned out by the man she had assisted , that much was sure . " What 's that picture ? " asked Cherry peering over her employer 's shoulder at the front page of the paper . " Those are the azaleas at Garrison Gardens . " " I 've heard of that -- some kind of vacation place , is n't it ? " " It 's one of the most important horticultural centers in the country , " she responded huffily . " Did n't they teach you anything in school about your own state ? " This was an overreaction , but Cherry would n't take offense . No one ever did when you were over ninety . No matter what you did , you were cute . " That garden place is in Charles Valley ? " " Yes . " But mere geographical location did n't begin to explain the relationship of the gardens to Charles Valley , Georgia . The little town owed its livelihood to Garrison Gardens . Students from around the world came to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Garrison Gardens resort to enjoy the lodge , the restaurants , the golf course , the man-made lake , the tennis courts , the RV campground , the hiking and biking trails , the country store , and the phenomenal thirty-thousand-acre Garrison Nature Preserve . Ms. McCready 's boss at the Charles Valley Gazette genuflected in print whenever he mentioned the gardens or the resort or the Garrison family that had built them . The family no longer owned the gardens , which were now part of a charitable trust . But the Garrisons -- or , more accurately , Peggy Garrison , who had inherited the whole shebang from her late husband , Dalton -- had a controlling voice on the board that ran the trust and retained full ownership of the very profitable resort attached to the gardens . The Garrison name -- if not the bloodline -- remained the eight-hundred-pound gorilla in the area . " Would you like me to read the paper to you ? " Cherry asked brightly . The girl was terminally perky . " You seem to be having a little trouble this morning . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crankily . " I 'll call you if I need you , dear . " " Okay , " Cherry said , in the indulgent tone that young people used with her now . She vanished and Old Missus reached up to turn on her fancy lamp . She was having a little trouble this morning . With her hands , not her eyes , thank you . Cherry had touched a nerve . It was foolish to keep renewing her subscription to the Gazette . Her only connection to the town had been gone for many years . But the little newspaper had become a part of her life . Some names had appeared regularly in it for so many years they were like old acquaintances . She liked to keep tabs on them . At her age , it was hard to make new friends . And it was n't true that she had no connection to the place -- there was still one person whose comings and goings had personal meaning for her . So it was with a gasp that she scanned the front page and read that Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
