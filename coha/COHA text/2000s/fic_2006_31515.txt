From How the Other Half Lives by Eileen M. Johnson Jamellah pulled the heavy Persian rug toward the hallway and off the wall-to-wall carpeting . Grabbing the vacuum cleaner and wrapping the thin cord around her slim brown hand , she turned the power on and began the task of cleaning the carpet . Humming an old Commodores tune , she pushed and pulled the vacuum until beads of perspiration formed above her nut-brown upper lip . Not only was today Friday , her usual cleaning day , but she was expecting company . Not just any company , but that of the sexy black male persuasion . Kenny was thirty-three years old , the owner of a small but profitable construction company , and very married . The fact that Kenny was married did not disappoint Jamellah . All of her boyfriends were married . As she always told her best friend , Fernecia , the more happily married they were , the better . Married men were low maintenance and that was right up Jamellah 's alley . Married men required no commitment , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were usually extra passionate and extra generous . That 's the way she liked her men . She had actually started dating married men at a very young age after quickly growing weary of young , inexperienced boys who were in her face constantly . So at nineteen , she had gone out and met Clarence at an after-work happy hour . Clarence was atwenty-eight-year-old dreamboat who already had his own small investment banking firm , the fabled house on the hill , and his own Benz . He also had a very somber and sexually unresponsive wife . This was a disappointment for Clarence but a blessing for Jamellah . She and Clarence participated in a hot and heavy fling that lasted until she turned twenty-one . In those two years , he managed to give her a used but still fashionable Audi , a pair of stunning two-carat diamond solitaire earrings , and a nearly permanent headache from his complaining about how unhappy his home life was . So after getting him to secure the financing on a snazzy little town house and helping her to set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well put together story . With well-rehearsed but very persuasive tears rolling down her cheeks , Jamellah told Clarence about how she could no longer sleep at night without him and how she wanted him to leave his wife . As much as Clarence wanted to be with the cute and sexually uninhibited Jamellah , he realized that the state they lived in was a community property state , and under no circumstances was he ready or willing to give his tight-lipped wife half in a divorce . After an Oscar-worthy performance , Jamellah told him that she might be willing to get over him in exchange for a few parting gifts . Relieved that Jamellah withdrew her staunch ultimatum and waved the white flag , he presented her with a nice diamond tennis bracelet , tuition for her last semester of college , a discreet and heavy deposit in her money-market account , and grateful thanks for the two years of her life that shed devoted to him . Amazingly , they parted as friends , and would occasionally meet for a drink and a quickie . Three months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stock portfolio , and degree , Jamellah was once again on the prowl . Love could definitely wait a few more years . Right now , she craved more security . After landing a job as an entry-level adjuster for a large insurance agency , she soon began to use her huge office building as a hunting ground . She paired crisp linen business suits with soft , lacy peekaboo camisoles and tall heels for a look that was professional yet sexy . Each morning , she painstakingly applied her makeup and arranged her extension-enhanced tresses to look like colleagues . Pretty soon , both her looks and her strong work ethic drew the attention of one of the company 's VPs . In the first six months that Jamellah worked for Southwestern Life and Casualty , not only did she do desk work but she also did her homework . She knew which of her suitors had the most pull within the company , who earned the most , who drove what , who was married to whom , and who could get her where she wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations , at the Christmas party , Jamellah soon made him her prey . From that point on , she always made it a point to look extra sexy at the Thursday afternoon staff meetings that he presided over . It also helped that she was always full of provocative conversation at all social functions . Within three months of the Christmas party , Jamellah was taking all of the gifts that Hugh presented her with , and he , in turn , accepted all her free time and talent . From her prior research , she knew that his wife , Meredith McDonough , cared only about the Times-Picayune society page and the city 's black bourgeoisie . Although Hugh was a lusty and insatiable lover and much older than she generally liked them , he was definitely the route that Jamellah needed to take . By the time Christmas rolled around again , Jamellah had been promoted to a competitive yet promising position as an underwriter . She received this promotion partly because of her hard work but more so because of Hugh 's iron influence on the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushy new gift from Hugh . Jamellah gladly got rid of her old car for Hugh 's gift , a brand-new , shiny black Audi A8 that she drove to her office with pleasure and pride . No matter how discreet the two attempted to keep their involvement , it was unmistakable . One minute Jamellah was trudging around the city assessing claims and the next she was three floors up in the building , her mind far from flood , fire , and accident damage . Of course , this did not sit well with the other sisters in the office . They had spent years at Dillard , Xavier , Southern , Alcorn , and Grambling , studying and preparing for corporate America . Some graduated magna and even summa cum laude and were shocked to find out that no matter how much education you got , you often wound up in a surplus pool of black college graduates fighting for entry-level jobs not even near your field . The shock went even further when they realized that a simple blow job or two could catapult a 2.5 GPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to move up to . This of course led to their extreme dislike of her . At forty-five , Hugh was handsome , wealthy , and wise beyond his years . However , for a brief time , he felt something for the twenty-three-year-old Jamellah that could have been mistaken for love . She returned the favor of his expensive gifts and favors with practiced sexual skills and unlimited affection , which he never got at home . Of course it would bother Jamellah when she would see Hugh and Meredith at social gatherings and on the society page , but she understood her place in his life and his place in her career . Hugh , in turn , would often get angry when the water-cooler talk by the agencys black male employees was about Jamellah and her fabled sexual escapades . But since no one in the office building knew about his relationship with her , he had to keep his anger to a minimum in public , but when he was alone with her , he lashed out at her with contempt and disgust . Contempt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when Jamellah decided that it was time to end their allegiance . Knowing that he would not agree with her decision , she came up with a surefire plan to keep her newfound prestige and at the same time end the troublesome relationship . With the urine of a hugely pregnant Fernecia and a Fact Plus pregnancy test , Jamellah managed to convince Hugh that she was carrying his baby . Afraid of the scandal the pregnancy would cause in the uppity black community and the jeopardy it would put his job and marriage in , Hugh quickly ended the relationship , but not without pacifying a threatening Jamellah . Not only did he give her three thousand dollars for a false late-term abortion , but Hugh also gave her five times that amount in hush-hush money . Jamellah could not believe her good fortune , while Hugh could not believe his stupidity . He made it a policy long before hed met Jamellah not to get involved with anyone who was connected with his job . Now he was sharing an office building with a walking time bomb who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had actually fallen in love with the young girl who had given him relieving icy rubdowns when he was in physical pain and soothing hot-oil massages when he wanted to feel pleasure . Sometimes when his heart and his dick overpowered his reasoning , he contacted her and attempted to renew their ties , but his requests were met with firm refusals and idle yet convincing threats . After one of these threats , which sounded more lethal than usual , Hugh decided to wean and save himself from Jamellah . At the same time , he decided to show her that his love for her had not been in vain . Jamellah was just coming out of the adjustment period in her new position when a corporate headhunter , who happened to be Hugh 's fraternity brother , contacted her about a better-paying and more secure position with an old and stable company in the northeastern part of the city . Overjoyed and aware that this was of Hugh 's doing , Jamellah promptly turned in her immediate resignation to Southwestern Life and Casualty . That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary was 25 percent larger and her conscience 100 percent smaller . Since then , she had been through three other married men who shed become involved with for material reasons , and a single black attorney who shed been involved with purely for pleasure . At twenty-four , Jamellah felt that she was on top of the world . She had a great job , an expensive automobile , and a professionally decorated town house that was on its way to being paid for . She was childless , free , and beautiful , which to her were the most important things in the world . Her family marveled at her success and her friends were mystified by how quickly shed climbed the corporate ladder and gained material wealth . They always knew that she 'd get out of the New Orleans ghetto that shed grown up in , but they never guessed that she 'd come this far . Unbeknownst to her friends , Jamellah was whoring just as they were , only at a much higher price . Continues ...         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
