<p> This spring , the dry mountains of Shikai were showered with rose petals to celebrate a truce between the Pakistani military and local pro-Al Qaeda militants . Together , they pledged to cleanse the tribal area of South Waziristan of all foreign militants . <p> Two months later , the floral confetti has turned to bullets and bombs . Jets and helicopter gunships circle in the sky , and militants on the ground vow to fight a jihad against the " traitorous " Pakistani Army . <p> Once a fight between Western democratic values and militant Islam , the war on terror along the Afghan-Pakistani border has become something murkier , complex , and ancient . Now , it 's tribal . <p> The rules of this war are a far cry from the easy slogans of " you 're either with us or against us . " Indeed , Pashtun history is filled with heroes who played both sides for the benefit of tribe , family , and honor . <p> The latest such figure is tribal leader Naik Mohammad . Before being killed this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qaeda guests and the Pakistani military trying to evict them . That it was the military who ultimately got double-crossed displays how much the antiterror coalition still must learn about how to influence the tribes who shelter top Al Qaeda leaders . <p> " The Army thinks they can give an order and people will just obey it , " says a former Pakistani intelligence officer . " They should have paid more attention to history . The Pashtuns do n't take orders from anybody . " <p> Following a bruising fight with tribesmen in March , Pakistan opted to negotiate . Through the mediation of local mullahs and legislators , military officials and five local militant leaders struck a truce . The five chiefs , including Mr. Mohammad , pledged to stop using Pakistani territory for terrorist activity . <p> But the settlement quickly soured when Mohammad refused to help register foreigners with the authorities , disputing with officials who said that had been agreed . What Pakistan was asking was the impossible : handing over guests in a culture that demands protection of those who seek refuge . Amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting erupted again ( see timeline ) . <p> Tribal insiders say it was easy for the militants to break their deal with the Pakistani government , because the deal was perceived to be conducted through local mullahs - not through an assembly of tribal elders , called a jirga . In Pashtun society , form is everything . <p> " Nobody was sincere , " says Mohammad Noor , an educated tribal member . " It was a deal with knives hidden under sleeves . Both sides are here to fight , not negotiate . " <p> Tribal elders , however , dispute that . Even now , they say , there 's room to negotiate . " The military demonstrated impatience in launching their operation , " says Maulvi Mairajuddin , a cleric who helped mediate the deal . " The cannons and bombings can not go side by side with negotiations in a tribal system . We still believe that talks can work better than guns . " <p> Tribal elder Malik Behram Khan agrees : " The more you bomb , the stronger will become the sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw their guests out of their homes ... Our culture does not allow us , and we are taunted for generations if we violate our customs . " <p> But if Pashtun tradition forbids a host from handing over his own guest , history is full of instances where rivals managed to do it for him , often to dishonor enemies . Where honor is all , dishonor is the ultimate weapon . <p> " For arresting a major Taliban commander , or even Osama or his No. 2 , Ayman al-Zawahiri , the intelligence officer should find out who he has a relationship with , " says a senior Afghan intelligence officer in Kabul . " These are people who are trusted . They can tell you what the plans are , where these people are located . " <p> Every major figure in tribal politics has enemies , this intelligence officer adds , even within his own family . And to bring down a rival , all methods are fair game . <p> " If you give money to somebody from a tribe , you can get information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence officer . " For an outsider , you ca n't get that information , because there is no trust . But from inside the tribe , we can get information , no problem . " <p> Setting off intertribal rivalries is a risky game - part of the reason why Pashtuns themselves are reluctant to do it . In a culture where every violent act is followed by an equal and opposite attack , most Pashtuns adopt a surprisingly nonviolent ethos . <p> " Tribal lashkars militias can not be effective , because tribals are threatened with dire consequences if they take any action , " says a tribal elder and former legislator , Malik Waris Khan Afridi . Pakistan encouraged tribesmen to form posses to round up the foreigners and their supporters , but the lashkars caught no one . <p> Yet US pressure is clearly mounting on Pakistan to quash the militants . In April , US ambassador to Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad , stated in a speech that if Pakistan did n't remove the foreign fighters , US troops would cross over from Afghanistan and do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naik Mohammad should buy Islamabad some time , but the fight is far from over . Al Qaeda maintains support in the tribal belt the military , Al Qaeda issued an ultimatum , described by one aide to Naik Mohammad this way : " We are born to sacrifice our lives in the name of Allah , not to indulge in tricks and deals to save our lives . Either be a mujahid holy warrior or join the Americans and their supporters . " <p> However , Al Qaeda threats are accompanied with gifts . Al Qaeda purchased local property for training camps at handsome prices . <p> " It is the economics of jihad playing its role in Waziristan , " says Dilawar Khan , an educated tribesman . " Some sold the foreigners tomatoes for 500 rupees , some sold their houses for 500,000 rupees , charging 10 times the price . Why would they kill the hen when they get golden eggs from it ? " <p> Such a deal becomes even more attractive to those who consider supporting Al Qaeda 's to be a service to Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangled monetary carrots , including million-dollar development projects to construct roads and schools . But development is a longer term pay off than cash handouts from Al Qaeda . And Pakistani incentives may not involve a wide enough group . <p> " Prior to this , development projects were just to bribe pro-government tribal elders or influential chieftains , " says analyst Behroz Khan in Peshawar . " The effective way of governance in the tribal areas is jirga and development projects should rout through it to give the locals a sense of participation . " <p> The government since British times has largely left the Pashtun tribes to rule themselves.Military operations were left for extraordinary circumstances . Today , the Pakistan is using many of the same British tactics of old . In Wana , the market has been closed down as collective punishment . <p> Apparently feeling the heat , tribesmen Wednesday insisted that authorities lift the economic sanctions and release detainees . The government countered by reiterating its demand for the handover of the remaining four pro-Al Qaeda leaders . <p> Opinions are divided on whether Naik Mohammad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Killing Naik Mohammad is not going to stop anything , " says Milt Beardon , a former CIA station chief in Islamabad . " Ultimately , Al Qaeda will find a new guy to take his place . " <p> But his death has temporarily stunned the tribes , and deprived the foreign fighters of a key backer and main liaison with the local population . " He was the strongest link between Al Qaeda and local militants and can not be replaced easily , " says Mr. Noor , the educated tribesman . <p> An interim successor has been chosen named Haji Mohammad Umer , who is believed to be more flexible than Naik Mohammad . The timing may be right for another round of negotiations . <p> " The militants will want to buy time and the authorities will not want to lose this opportunity to further weaken the nexus between foreigners and locals by using a carrot and stick policy against the tribesmen , " says Mr. Noor . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
