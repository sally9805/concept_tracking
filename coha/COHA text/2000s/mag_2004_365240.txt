Intense fighting broke out last week between U.S. troops , backed by Iraqi forces , and fighters loyal to the radical Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr . But while al-Sadr 's Mahdi militia represents a serious threat to Iraq 's stability , an equally vexing challenge to Iraqi order is taking shape in the Sunni Muslim  --  dominated area northwest of Baghdad , where Sunni terrorists , Baathists and nationalists are thriving . <P> These resistance groups have so far cooperated only erratically , when it suits their needs . But insurgent sources tell TIME that elements in the resistance , especially jihadis who have ties to al-Qaeda , are pushing to unite the area 's disparate militants under a single command . The insurgents are working through a loose assembly of leaders known as Mujahedin Shura , often translated as " supreme council of the mujahedin . " This informal group , which meets occasionally to share intelligence and tactical tips , already has a defense minister , an army chief and an operations commander of sorts . At recent meetings , insurgent leaders  --  including Iraqi nationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their activities under a single leader . According to several sources involved in the movement , Syrian intelligence agents in the area , who have helped arm the groups and aided their propaganda campaigns , have also been participating in the debate . <P> But the resistance has its divisions  --  at least in part because jihadist leaders allied to al-Qaeda  --  linked Jordanian terrorist Abu Mousab alZarqawi , a proponent of the unified command , seem to be trying to take control . Militant sources tell TIME that their rise has alienated some insurgents , especially the Baathists and nationalists , who resent the influence of foreigners . Whoever wins , the more disturbing development is that some Iraqi jihadis , hoping to take their fight beyond Iraq 's borders , are threatening to launch a terrorist campaign in the U.S. " If America continues to shield its people from the truth , " says an al-Zarqawi loyalist , " we shall transport the battle to where their public can not but see it .
