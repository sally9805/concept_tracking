<p> Emily Sano has two reputations : as an accomplished scholar and connoisseur of Asian art ( particularly Japanese art ) and as a propulsive , unforgiving and effective administrator . <p> As director of the Asian Art Museum since 1995 , and chief curator and deputy director before that , she presided over the institution 's 2003 move from Golden Gate Park to permanent quarters in the custom-refitted Old Main Library in Civic Center . She instituted a curatorial department of Korean art and smoothed the path of several substantial gifts that enriched the museum 's already stellar and encyclopedic holdings . <p> In March , Sano , 65 , announced her intention to step down . She has agreed to stay on through 2007 or until an international search turns up a qualified replacement . <p> Her successor will face the immediate project of funding and building an extension to the Asian that will complete its permanent home . <p> We talked recently at the museum across a table stacked with 33 catalogs and books that the institution has published during her tenure . <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : Not that I know of . There are people who come to mind because they 're in the field , but their number is really quite small . ... So far , no one 's volunteering , and I do n't know why that is . I would hope it 's not because they think it 's too hard . <p> Q : I seem to recall that the estimate for the extension was $30 million . I 'm guessing it would probably be more than that now . <p> A : I 'm sure it would be more than that now . Until you actually choose an architect and get a design to cost out , you do n't really know . <p> Q : What will that extension add ? <p> A : Much needed special-exhibition space . We are fairly limited in our special-exhibition space . It 's only about 8,400 square feet total . It does mean that we have a lot of down time between shows , and that 's not good . And it means that certain large shows we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on having multiple venues ? <p> A : We do a lot of shows of our own that do n't travel . Working with certain countries , you ca n't travel them either . Japan used to do three shows a year in the United States , and they wanted multiple venues . They do n't want that at all anymore . They found it too exhausting , too much wear and tear on the objects , so any show from Japan goes to one place and that 's all . We are traveling our Ming Dynasty show . It 's going to Indianapolis and St. Louis . <p> Q : What besides the exhibition space would be added ? <p> A : The second and third levels would be the auditorium . You know , we desperately wanted an auditorium . We have managed to begin adding features to Samsung Hall that make it possible to use it for slide lectures , for example . It now has blackout shades , so we can show film and do slide lectures there pretty effectively , but it 's still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to move the location of our library . ... The library right now is placed over a historic ceiling , and it 's simply not strong enough to take the load of movable shelves , so we have books down in the basement , which makes it awkward for the librarians , to say the least . <p> Q : What 's the next biggest problem you see yourself handing off to your successor ? <p> A : I think the exhibition schedule is the next thing . But I would n't call the building project the biggest problem because lots of people like building projects . The board can get very excited about building , and there 's a lot of energy around it . That was certainly true moving into this building . It 's a thrilling activity . But the realities of operating require that we have to have this strong exhibition schedule all along and achieve financial stability at the same time we 're raising capital and running a public program . <p> Q : If you could choose your successor , would curatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I firmly believe that the people who run museums really need to understand the product . So that would be my preference . That 's not to say there are n't museum professionals out there who did n't come through the curatorial ranks and are successful . ... But without their having a feel for the art and the continent of Asia , I 'd be hard put to say that such a person would be suited to this job . <p> Q : Can you comment on the Asian-ness issue ? There is no such place as Asia , really , but there are many cultures lumped under that heading . How much difficulty is there around that issue ? <p> A : Well , we have tried to serve all our constituencies ... but I ca n't say that we try to make it all even . We do tend to have more programming in Chinese and Japanese art than in other areas . India and Southeast Asia are particularly important . One area that 's not represented curatorially is West Asia , though we do have a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that everyone 's got to know about Asia because this is going to be , without question , an Asian century . <p> Q : You mention that this is going to be an Asian century . Have there been others ? <p> A : Way back in the past , yes . ... In the 20th century , China was falling apart and Japan was being an aggressor , so those were very bad times . But if you go back to the Tang Dynasty , when you think about the amount of trade that has taken place over time , it 's really astonishing . And that 's now being studied and understood better , but for a long time , I think it was not recognized . <p> Q : Do you see a lingua franca problem impeding the progress of the " Asian century " ? We Westerners are so primitive in our perception of Asian languages , especially written languages . <p> A : Fortunately for us , there are an awful lot of people who are treating English as the international lingua franca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for certain kinds of Chinese and Japanese art exhibitions because the names are sort of hard for people to remember . ... That 's why we 've so far focused just on solo shows , because at least it gives the public a chance to encounter someone in enough depth that they can sort of get a picture of the character of this artist and his work . <p> Q : What do you expect to do after retirement ? <p> A : So far , I 've only made one definite plan , and that is to be in Florence for the months of April and May . I 've already rented an apartment . I want to be in Europe . Also , I 'm interested in one research project . It could be a university , it could be a program in Washington if I 'm successful with that - it 's an application process - but I 'd rather not discuss it yet . It 's something that I 've developed an interest in fairly recently . <p> Q : What 's been the most difficult day-to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building ? <p> A : I was asked when I first came to the Asian whether I liked administration and I said , " Well , I do n't think anybody really does , but there is a belief that things can run well . " You 'd like to believe that that 's possible . ... Attendance does concern me because we got hit very hard , as did other institutions in the city , with the opening of the de Young . It 's always a concern to me that we try to make the institution perpetually young , lively , interesting . <p> Q : What will you miss most about this position ? <p> A : You know , I 'm not sure . I 'm very happy about the level of activity at the institution , the productivity of the institution , the change in attitude among the staff as it got bigger and younger people were hired , the books , the exhibitions . I love that sense of accomplishment very much . I can imagine missing the excitement of opening a great show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public has been very good to us since we opened here . 1 Asian Art Museum Director Emily Sano is surrounded by stacks of catalogs published by the institution during her tenure .
