Toys Go Out By Emily Jenkins ; illustrated by Paul Zelinsky Random House Emily Jenkins ; illustrated by Paul Zelinsky In the Backpack , Where It Is Very Dark The backpack is dark and smells like a wet bathing suit . Waking up inside , Lumphy feels cramped and grumped . " I wish I had been asked , " he moans . " If I had been asked , I would have said I was n't going . " " Shhh , " says StingRay , though she does n't like the dark backpack any more than Lumphy . " It 's not so bad if you do n't complain . " " We were n't told about this trip , " snorts Lumphy . " We were just packed in the night . " " Why do n't you shut your buffalo mouth ? " snaps StingRay . " Your buffalo mouth is far too whiny . " There is a small nip on the end of her tail , and StingRay curls it away from Lumphy 's big square buffalo teeth . Plastic usually hums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tum tum -- tum -- tiddle -- tee , " she trills , to see if it will make the inside of the backpack seem any nicer . " Do n't you know the words to that song ? " asks Lumphy . " There are no words . It 's a hum , " answers Plastic . No one says anything for a while , after that . " Does anyone know where we 're going in here ? " wonders Lumphy . Plastic does not . StingRay does n't , either . " My stomach is uncomfortable , " grumphs the buffalo . " I think I 'm going to be sick . " . . . . . Buh-buh bump ! It feels like the backpack is going down some stairs . Or maybe up some stairs . Or maybe up something worse than stairs . StingRay tries to think calming thoughts . She pictures the high bed with the fluffy pillows where she usually sleeps . She pictures the Little Girl with the blue barrette , who scratches where the ears would be if StingRay had ears . But none of these thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to the vet , " StingRay says , finally . " What 's the vet ? " asks Lumphy . " The vet is a big human dressed in a white coat who puts animals in a contraption made from rubber bands , in order to see what is wrong with them , " answers StingRay , who sometimes says she knows things when she does n't . " Then he pokes them over and over with needles the size of carrots , and makes them drink nasty-tasting medicine , and puts them in the bumpity washing machine to fix whatever 's broken . " " If anyone needs to go to the vet , it 's the one-eared sheep , " says Plastic , remembering the oldest of the Little Girl 's toys . " And Sheep 's not even here . No , we ca n't be going to the vet . We are n't broken . " " Speak for yourself , " snorts Lumphy , who feels even sicker than before at the thought of the bumpity washing machine . . . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back and forth . Back and forth . Or maybe round and round . " I hope we 're not going to the zoo , " moans StingRay . " They 'll put us in cages with no one to talk to . Each one in a separate cage , and we 'll have to woosh back and forth all day , and do tricks on giant swings , with people throwing quarters at our faces , and teasing . " " I do n't think we 're big enough for the zoo , " Plastic says hopefully . " I 'm pretty sure they 're only interested in very large animals over there . " " I 'm large , " says Lumphy . " She means really , really , very large , " says StingRay . " At the zoo they have stingrays the size of choo-choo trains ; and plastics the size of swimming pools . Zoo buffaloes would never fit in a backpack . They eat backpacks for lunch , those buffaloes . " " Is that true ? " asks Lumphy , but nobody answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpack is thrown onto the ground . Or maybe into a trash can . Or onto a garbage truck . " We might be going to the dump ! " cries StingRay . " We 'll be tossed in a pile of old green beans , and sour milk cartons , because the Little Girl does n't love us anymore , and it will be icy cold all the time , and full of garbage-eating sharks , and it will smell like throw-up . " " I do n't think so , " soothes Plastic . " I 'll be forced to sleep on a slimy bit of used paper baggie , instead of on the big high bed with the fluffy pillows ! " continues StingRay . There is a noise outside the backpack . Not a big noise , but a rumbly one . " Did you hear that ? " asks StingRay . " I think it is the X-ray machine . The vet is going to X-ray us one by one and look into our insides with an enormous magnifying glass , and then poke us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not an X-ray , " says Plastic calmly , although she is n't sure at all . " An X-ray would be squeakier . " " Then I think it is a lion , " cries StingRay . " A lion at the zoo who does not want to be on display with any small creatures like you and me . A lion who does n't like sharing her swing set , and wants all the quarters for herself . She is roaring because she has n't had any lunch yet , and her favorite food is stingrays . " " A lion would be fiercer , " says Plastic , a bit un- certainly . " It would sound hungrier , I bet . " " Maybe it is a giant buffalo , " suggests Lumphy . " Maybe it is a dump truck ! " squeals StingRay . " A big orange dump truck tipping out piles of rotten groceries on top of us , and trapping us with the garbage-eating sharks and the throw-up smell ! " " Would n't a dump truck be louder ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have a point . " I 'm sure it 's not a dump truck . " . . . . . The backpack thumps down again with a bang . " I would like to be warned , " moans Lumphy . " Sudden bumps make everything worse than it already is . " " The Girl does n't love us and she 's trying to get rid of us ! " cries StingRay in a panic . The backpack opens . The rumbly noise gets louder , and the light is very bright -- so bright that StingRay , Plastic , and Lumphy have to squinch up their eyes and take deep breaths before they can see where they are . A pair of warm arms takes them all out of the dark , wet-bathing-suit smell together . The three toys look around . There are small chairs , a sunny window , and a circle of fidgety faces . It is not the vet . It is not the zoo . It is not the dump . ( They are pretty sure . ) But where is it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please Be Quiet Now . And then comes a familiar voice . " These are my best friends , " says the Little Girl who owns the backpack and sleeps in the high bed with the fluffy pillows . " My best friends in the world . That 's why I brought them to show-and-tell . " " Welcome , " says the teacher . Sticky , unfamiliar fingers pat Lumphy 's head and StingRay 's plush tail . Plastic is held up for all to admire . " We are here to be shown and told , " she whispers to StingRay and Lumphy , feeling quite bouncy as she looks around at the schoolroom . " Not to be thrown away or put under the X-ray machine ! " The teacher says Lumphy looks a lot like a real buffalo . ( Lumphy wonders what the teacher means by " real , " but he is too happy to worry much about it . ) " We 're special ! " whispers StingRay . " We 're her best friends ! " " I knew it would be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Funny , but the ride home is not so uncomfortable . The smell is still there , but the backpack seems rather cozy . Plastic has herself a nap . StingRay is n't worried about vets and zoos and gar-bage dumps anymore ; she curls herself into a ball by Lumphy 's buffalo stomach . " The Little Girl loves us , " she tells him . " I knew it all along , really . I just did n't want to say . " Lumphy licks StingRay 's head once , and settles down to wait . When he knows where he is going , traveling is n't so bad . And right now , he is going home . by Emily Jenkins ; illustrated by Paul Zelinsky Excerpted by permission .
