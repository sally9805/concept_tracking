The Other Side of Town <p> ( Louise , Fall 1998 ) <p> Probably it is for the best that Caroline has chosen to go to play practice rather than to attend Sandy 's funeral with Nanny Rose and me . Still , Nanny Rose will give me hell when she realizes that neither Caroline nor John Henry is coming . ( Nor Charles for that matter , who is only eleven and too young for this . ) Sandy worked for Nanny Rose for the last thirty-three years . The last eleven of those years she worked for us too . That was Nanny Rose 's gift to us after I had Charles ; she sent Sandy over to our house once a week . Of course she waited until I had a boy to offer help , even though it turned out Charles was an easy baby while Caroline nearly drove me to the loony bin . <p> Sandy was there the day I brought Charles home from Piedmont Hospital . And a year later , when we moved from our Peachtree Hills starter house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby while I directed the movers with the furniture . Poor Sandy . When she walked out the door of our little house carrying Charles , our dog Cleo up and bit her on the leg . Cleo had never been a biter ; the only explanation was that Cleo thought Sandy was taking away the baby same as the movers were taking away all the furniture . Most of the movers were African American , as is  --  was , I should say  --  Sandy . <p> After that I kept Cleo in the fenced side yard every Monday when Sandy would come . Sandy loved Baby Charles . Once he was old enough to chew , she 'd bring him a candy bar every week . I would have to drive to the gas station on Peachtree and buy Caroline one too or else suffer through her tantrum . Of course I would have preferred it if Sandy had brought both children a treat , but I did n't feel that I could ask her to do so , knowing that she did n't have any extra money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed none the worse for it . Our spoiling just made him sweeter . Really . He was just as pudgy and smiley as a baby could be . How John Henry and I created such a sweet boy  --  such an open and loving little person  --  from the same genes that formed Caroline the Terror , I will never know . <p> I never notice how messy my car is until it is time for either John Henry or Nanny Rose to ride in it . John Henry is fond of saying that I use my car as a giant handbag , stashing all sorts of stuff in it . Well , I 'm sorry . My house and my person are always tidy . There has to be one place where I can allow things to get a little cluttered . I pick the empty Diet Coke cans off the car floor and throw them into the Herbie Curbie . If Caroline were with me she would insist that I recycle them , but the recycle box is inside the house and I simply do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charles and Faye ( my other cleaning lady , who comes on Thursdays , although now I suppose I 'll have to see if she can come on Mondays as well ) and pull out of the driveway heading down Peachtree Circle toward Peachtree Street . Nanny Rose lives a few miles north , in Buckhead . The funeral is on the south side of the city , so it is out of the way to pick her up , but Nanny Rose is seventy-seven and both John Henry and I try to make sure she drives as little as possible . John Henry jokes that in her dotage she " speeds more and sees less . " <p> Even though I was born in Ansley Park , and John Henry and I have lived here for over ten years , it still gives me a little thrill to drive through my neighborhood . I just love the tall old trees , the fine architecture , the sense that even though the skyscrapers of Midtown frame the neighborhood , when you are in Ansley Park you are in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the houses that line Franklin Street as you drive into Chapel Hill , where John Henry and I met , or rather , where we began our relationship , as we had met once or twice before we went to college . Our families , both from Atlanta , ran in similar , though not entirely overlapping circles . ( Frankly , John Henry 's family was " older " than mine . ) Before college John Henry and I hardly knew each other . The fact that we went to rival high schools had a lot to do with that . He attended Coventry while I went to Birch . <p> If John Henry had his way we would probably live in Buckhead or even Sandy Springs . He complains that the houses in Ansley Park are too close together and that there are too many cars parked on the streets , especially during the weekends , when people from other neighborhoods drive over here , park , and walk to Piedmont Park . And good Lord do n't even get him started on Freaknik , when students from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Piedmont Park for a party , but not before blocking the traffic in our neighborhood for hours with all of their jumping in and out of each other 's cars and dancing in the streets . <p> What really bothers John Henry about the neighborhood is that he 's in the minority being a Republican over here . Not that Ansley Park is a hotbed of radicalism . ( Lord no . Daddy , whose political views often put him in the neighborhood minority , still counted many from Ansley Park as his friends and allies . ) Still , to John Henry 's chagrin , most of our neighbors are progressive in their politics . They are usually tasteful about it , of course . Most people from Ansley Park would rather write a big check than make a big scene . <p> Another thing John Henry is not thrilled about is Ansley 's close proximity to Midtown . Not the office buildings , but the little strip of shops on Piedmont and Tenth Street that cater to a gay clientele . Midtown , after all , has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not , as my colorist , Chevre , says , " gay friendly . " <p> But I love our neighborhood . I love the tall modern buildings peeping over the gracious old homes . Living in Ansley Park , you never forget that Atlanta actually is a city . Most people who say they live in Atlanta do not live in the city at all . Most of our four million residents live OTP  --  outside the perimeter . But Ansley Park is in the center of things , and consequently I never have to drive more than fifteen minutes to get anywhere I need to be . The farthest I drive is to Coventry , where Charles and Caroline are in school , and that 's only about five miles away . It 's like my best friend Tiny always says : " The only time I go OTP is when I 'm on an airplane . " <p> Caroline says that the whole city is one big strip mall . I say it 's made up of neighborhoods , that the old homes are really its attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you stop and think , " Now I 'm in the heart of the city . " Atlanta is n't like a New York or a San Francisco . There 's no equivalent to Greenwich Village or North Beach here . <p> Virginia Highlands , with its boutiques and restaurants , tries to be that , I suppose , but it does n't have the diversity , the push and pull , the tumult . To be honest , Oakland Cemetery , over there off Memorial Drive , is where I feel most in the city . The cemetery is wide , hilly , and shaded with oaks . The two smokestacks of the old mill in Cabbagetown border it on one side ; the modern Atlanta skyline on the other . Inside the actual cemetery are crumbling brick paths , stone gravestones , and mausoleums bearing the names of important Atlanta families . Also , there are thousands of unmarked Confederate soldiers ' graves and a section where large tombstones bearing Stars of David and Jewish names are all smushed together ( the cemetery was originally segregated and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones is buried at Oakland . So is Margaret Mitchell . <p> I wonder where Sandy will be buried . I do n't even know how you go about getting buried nowadays if your family has n't already bought a plot of land for you . Maybe Sandy will be cremated , though I doubt it . I have a feeling that as a Baptist , she 'd rather be laid in the ground so that her body will be around for the Resurrection . <p> I turn right on Peachtree Street and head toward Nanny Rose 's white brick house on Peachtree Battle Avenue , the same house John Henry grew up in . Nanny Rose has not redecorated since she moved in over fifty years ago . She once told me that " good taste never goes out of style , " which , frankly , assumes a lot . John Henry 's old room is painted egg yellow , same as it was when he slept there as a boy , and it still has two metal-framed twin beds in it , one for John Henry and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot himself in the head his senior year at the University of Georgia . <p> It 's one thirty on the dot when I arrive at Nanny Rose 's house , but even so , she is waiting outside in the ninety-degree heat . ( I 've lived in Atlanta my entire life except for when I was at college , yet every year I forget that early September is often just as hot as August . ) <p> Nanny Rose has a way of making you feel that you are always late . You would n't think such a little woman could be so intimidating . <p> Her hair is so black it looks almost blue in the midday sun . She must have colored it last night . I have asked her a million times to let Chevre do it , to give it a softer , more natural look , but she refuses , even though Chevre is the absolute best , able to transform my dull brown hair  --  embedded with lots of gray  --  into the glossy , rich color of polished mahogany . Nanny Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unnecessary indulgence . <p> As much of it as she has , she 's really quite frugal with her money . <p> I drive up next to her , stop the car , lean over the passenger seat , and push her door open from the inside . She stands stiffly beside it . I sigh , turn off the ignition , and get out . Oh Lord . Here we go . <p> After officially opening the car door for her , I hold Gunther , her blond Pomeranian , who is apparently going with us to the funeral , while she lowers herself sideways into the seat . <p> " Come on back to Mother , " she says , holding out her hands for the dog . <p> Once Gunther is safely in her lap , she rotates her bottom until she is facing forward . I close her door and walk back around to the driver 's side . Once in my seat , I notice that Nanny Rose 's smell , a mix of floral perfume and Aqua Net , has already permeated the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tilts her cheek , almost imperceptibly , toward me and I lean over to kiss it . Her cheek feels dry and powdery beneath my lips . She has applied her rouge in a red circle , much as a clown would , although on Nanny Rose it does n't look clownish , just old-fashioned . <p> " Nanny Rose , I like your suit , " I say . <p> I do . She wears a pink-and-white-checked suit  --  ancient Chanel , I 'm sure  --  nude pantyhose , and pink flats . As always she wears a thin gold chain around her neck with her diamond engagement ring and her wedding band hanging from it . Her fingers , which are bony and long , swell from arthritis . She runs her right hand roughly over Gunther 's spine . He emits a low growl . <p> " Where are the children ? " she asks , peering around to look in the back of the car as if Caroline and Charles might be hiding below the seats . " Where is John Henry ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline  --  well  --  she got cast in the school play , Steel Magnolias , and she really did n't feel that she could miss practice . " <p> Nanny Rose looks at me as if she just swallowed something that tastes terrible . " She ca n't miss play practice for a funeral ? " <p> " Apparently it was a huge deal that she got a lead part as a sophomore , and she 's just nervous about it . She does n't want to upset the director . " <p> " Do you think it 's appropriate for her to put so much time and energy into extracurricular activities when her grades are so dismal ? " <p> I shrug my shoulders . Frankly , I have no idea what I should do about Caroline and her terrible attitude toward school , but I 'd no sooner take acting away from her than I would throw her out on the street . That girl lives to perform . <p> " John Henry never had any scholastic difficulties , " says Nanny Rose . " He was an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say , flashing her a smile before focusing again on the road . " He and I met at Chapel Hill , remember ? " <p> " Oh yes . Of course . Which house were you in ? " <p> " Chi Omega , " I say . We have been over this a hundred times . <p> " Chi Omega is a good old house . Of course , Pi Beta Phi is best , is n't it , Gunther ? " She scratches the dog under his chin . <p> " Chi O was a top house , " I say , turning onto the entrance ramp of I-75 south . <p> " We 're taking the expressway ? " asks Nanny Rose , her voice alarmed . Nanny Rose never drives on the expressway . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I say . " Do n't worry , this will pop us right over to the church . " <p> " Thirty-three years Sandy worked for me and I never knew she was a Baptist . " <p> " Sandy did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nanny Rose nods solemnly . " I know . That was one of the things I liked best about her . She always showed up on time and never called to say she was sick and could n't make it . I had this other girl working for me  --  Josephine . She 'd come on the day Sandy was at your house , except she hardly ever came . There was always something the matter with either her child or her car . Not Sandy . Sandy was as reliable as the postman . More so ! " <p> I glance at Nanny Rose and see that her eyes are pooling with tears . She reaches into her quilted clutch , pulls out a linen handkerchief , and dabs her eyes with it . <p> " I 've slowed down , " she says . " I ca n't do everything for myself the way I used to . Sandy , she used to help me in and out of the bath ; she used to help me into my clothes . Why , it got so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she 's up and left me and I 'm not going to have anyone to help me get around anymore . You ca n't help me , can you , Gunther ? " she asks , lifting Gunther 's chin with her hand . <p> " I 'm not going to be able to go to circle or to play bridge or to go have lunch at the Club now that my Sandy is gone . No one will be there to help me get myself together . " <p> Nanny Rose is crying in earnest now . She looks so small in the passenger seat . She looks like a child . <p> " You got yourself together today , did n't you ? " I ask . " Look at how nice you 're dressed . " <p> Nanny Rose blows her nose into the corner of her handkerchief and then folds it over . <p> " We 'll find you someone else , " I say . " Sandy might have a granddaughter or a niece who would like to come and work for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I refrain . Though I 'm sorry that Sandy died , I am not sorry to be done with sharing " help " with Nanny Rose . The less tangled my day-to-day life is with my mother-in-law , the better . <p> " No one will be able to replace her , Louise . You ought to know that . " <p> I have never heard Nanny Rose talk about Sandy this way . They were always so formal with each other . Nanny Rose still had Sandy wear a maid 's uniform , for goodness ' sake , a little starched black dress with a white apron . Nanny Rose was always " Mrs. Parker " to Sandy . Nanny Rose even had a little silver bell she would ring when she needed her . <p> Our exit should be coming up , but I 'm not exactly sure which one it is . I ask Nanny Rose if she will look in the glove compartment for the directions . She starts pulling out all the folded maps that John Henry makes me keep in there . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for me . Look for a yellow sheet of legal paper . " <p> Nanny Rose fumbles around in there some more , pulling out several of Caroline 's CDs . One shows a close-up of a girl 's tiny pink shorts , the V of her crotch evident . Nanny Rose snorts . <p> " They let any hussy put her picture up nowadays , do n't they ? " she says . <p> All I can think to say is " Yes , ma'am . " <p> I spot the directions in the corner of the glove compartment , and I reach across Nanny Rose to yank them out . <p> " You drive , " she says . " I 'll look at these . " <p> She straightens the directions with her hand . " Turn left on Peachtree Circle , " she says . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I say , as patiently as I can . " I already did that . We 're all the way to where we exit off I-Twenty . Does it say which exit we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the page . She rests the directions on top of Gunther 's head , making it look as if he is wearing a paper hat . " All right now . Get on I-Seventy-five south . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . We 've done that . " <p> " Get onto I-Twenty west , " she says . <p> I have to hold myself back from snatching the directions out of her hands . <p> Gunther barks , knocking the directions off his head and onto the floor . Nanny Rose bops him on his wet nose . " Bad boy ! " she says . <p> As she bends down to fish the directions off the floor , I pass the exit . That was it . That was where I was supposed to get off . Damn . John Henry warned me to follow his directions carefully . Otherwise , he said , it might be Bonfire of the Vanities all over again . I pull off at the next exit , hoping I will see an entrance ramp as soon as I do , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where I am supposed to be . <p> Once off the expressway , I notice right away that the billboards are smaller on this side of town and that they feature black people instead of white . On the side of the road , just in front of a strip mall with a Dollar General and a check-cashing business , is a man selling socks . His sign reads " 100 pair for $5 . " He sits behind a cardboard table , bags and bags of socks stacked on top of it . <p> If I bought everyone in my family a hundred pairs of socks , I would n't have to do laundry for weeks . <p> " I believe John Henry Senior once owned some property over here , " says Nanny Rose . " A sign . He rented it for twenty dollars a month . " <p> It seems John Henry 's daddy owned some piece of every neighborhood in Atlanta . <p> " John Henry Senior and I used to drive by his properties after church , " says Nanny Rose . " Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop for a Frosty Orange at the Varsity on our way back home . He called this area Colored Town , though I guess people do n't say that anymore . " <p> Where is that entrance ramp ? Did I get so distracted by those damn socks that I drove right past it ? <p> " I do n't think I 'd use that expression at the funeral if I was you , " I say , looking for a good place to turn around . <p> Nanny Rose and I may well be the only white people there . I glance down at my brown Armani pants that I wear with a black silk shirt that ties in little bows around the cuffs . My outfit would pass muster at an Episcopalian funeral , but I start to worry I 'm not dressed up enough for the Baptists . <p> I turn down a side street that appears residential . Nanny Rose holds Gunther up to the window , looking to see if they can spot any dogs on the sidewalk . <p> " Good heavens , Louise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through the slums ? " <p> We pass a house stripped entirely of its siding . We pass a boarded-up apartment marked with " No Trespassing " signs . We pass unadorned lawns , an old Cadillac , and a sleepy-eyed man in overalls whose gaze follows our car until we have passed him . <p> " Are the doors locked ? " Nanny Rose asks . <p> I wish I had n't already thought the same thing . I wish I did n't get nervous driving through poor black neighborhoods . I wish I was n't relieved that the Lexus locks automatically , which is such an improvement over when you had to lock the door yourself , drawing attention to the act both by moving your hand to the lock and by the loud clicking noise that accompanied the action . <p> Up ahead by a stop sign is a group of black boys who must be around Caroline 's age . All of them wear long white T-shirts , which look as if they have been bleached and ironed , on top of jeans pulled down so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All but one wears bright white sneakers . The other has on black sneakers with Velcro straps instead of laces , the straps flailing to the sides , intentionally left undone . A couple of the boys wear their hair braided into thick cornrows ; one has an Afro with a comb stuck in it . It is he who looks down the street and notices our car coming their way . <p> I grip the steering wheel even tighter while telling myself to calm down . These are only boys , only children Caroline 's age , and there is no reason , just because they are black , that I should be afraid of them . We studied the perception versus the reality of actual danger once in Sunday school and how it is our internalized racism that makes us scared of those who are  --  in fact  --  quite often the most vulnerable and disadvantaged . Still , it 's not as if Nanny Rose and I blend into the neighborhood . It 's not as if we are driving a rusty old car . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me for my birthday . <p> " I would just drive on through that stop sign if I were you , " says Nanny Rose . " A group of boys is never up to any good . " <p> The boys spread out , watching us come toward them . I tap the brakes . As we roll toward the group I lock eyes with the one who has the comb stuck in his hair . He raises his hand as if he 's waving me on by , then just before I drive past him , he steps in front of the car . I swerve , barely avoiding contact , and drive through the intersection without stopping . From my rearview mirror Iwatch him laugh and slap the hands of his friends . <p> The service was scheduled to begin at two . It 's almost two thirty by the time we finally find the church . The small parking lot is full , but we find a space across the street . Nanny Rose takes her compact out of her purse and reapplies lipstick while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot I am beginning to sweat . I hope there are no rings of perspiration seeping through my silk top . When Nanny Rose has finished reapplying her lipstick she looks up at me through the window , indicating that I may open her door . When I do , she rotates her bottom once again so that her legs are sticking out . She holds Gunther in one arm and grabs my hand with the other . I pull her to her feet . It always surprises me when I stand next to Nanny Rose that she is a half foot shorter than I am . <p> Nanny Rose fishes Gunther 's leash out of her purse , attaches it to his collar , and puts him down on the hot sidewalk . His toenails make a fast little clicking noise as we cross the street . <p> The church is a plain white brick building , a perfect rectangle with a pitched roof supporting a metal cross . The cross looks like a lightning rod . Nanny Rose , Gunther , and I walk to the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in red , blocky letters . A short black woman , wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and white gloves , holds the door open for us . <p> " Welcome , " she says . " I 'm Miss Ella Watson , Mr. Brown 's next-door neighbor . I 'm also on the Mother Board here at Mount Zion . " <p> " How wonderful , " says Nanny Rose . " I 'm Mrs. John Henry Parker Senior , and this is my daughter-in-law , Mrs. John Henry Parker Junior . Sandy worked for our family for over thirty years . " <p> " Call me Louise , " I say . <p> " Well , it sure is good of y'all to come , " says Miss Watson . " And Sandy looks just as peaceful as can be , praise God . The undertaker did a fine job , a fine job indeed . Pastor 's not here yet , so there 's still time to look at the body . " <p> Nanny Rose bends down to pick up Gunther . I doubt he 's allowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him outside . His little brain would cook in no time . <p> The church is packed . As I expected , Nanny Rose and I are the only white people in here . As we walk toward the viewing line , I notice that there are no hymnals tucked into the backs of the pews . No Bibles either . At All Saints there are kneelers beneath each pew , but of course Baptists do n't use those . There is a portrait of a black man in a white suit hanging behind the altar . At first I think the portrait is a rendering of a black Jesus , which I think is just wonderful , but as we move up in the viewing line I 'm able to make out the lettering below the portrait , which reads " Pastor Williams . " <p> There must be over a hundred people packed into this church . I have no idea who any of them might be . Sandy never spoke about her home life . I probably should have asked her about it , but I was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth , I felt guilty having a black housekeeper . I felt as if I were holding a string that connected me to my mother and grandmother ( both of whom had black maids ) , all the way back to the wives of slave owners . Maybe it is silly , but I 've always felt more comfortable having Faye , who is white , clean for me , even though Faye comes with her own set of problems and Sandy was the much better worker of the two . <p> The woman directly in front of us in the viewing line wears a blue hat with a white polka-dot band . She turns to look at us , and I detect a flicker of surprise on her face . I do n't know if she 's surprised because we are white or because of Gunther . <p> " Can you believe that no-good preacher has n't showed up yet ? " she asks . <p> Nanny Rose sticks out her free hand . " I 'm Mrs. John Henry Parker Senior , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , confused . " Gunther ? " she asks . <p> " No , ma'am , " I say , smiling . " I 'm Louise Parker , Mrs. Parker 's daughter-in-law . " I point at the dog . " That 's Gunther . " <p> " Lord have mercy , " she says . " I 'm Mrs. Evelyn Brown , and that sure is the tiniest dog I 've ever seen . " <p> Gunther bares his teeth and starts barking at Mrs. Brown . Nanny Rose quickly slaps his nose . <p> " Bad boy ! " she says . " You 'll have to excuse him . He is just distraught over Sandy 's passing . " <p> " Have mercy , " says Mrs. Brown . " That dog must have liked Sandy a lot more than Sandy liked it . " <p> We edge closer and closer to her coffin . I remind myself not to touch Sandy 's face . Ever since I was a little girl and I went to my great-grandmother 's funeral , I have had a compulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . It 's almost as if I ca n't believe the flesh will be cold instead of warm and I just want to feel it for myself . Some people , I 'm sure , find it morbid to view the body after death , but I find it greatly comforting . It 's just so obvious that the person  --  his or her spirit  --  is no longer present . It makes me wonder if there is indeed a place the spirit might go . <p> There is a stir in the church . I turn around and look at the entrance and see that the man whom I recognize from the portrait behind the altar is making his way down the center aisle of the church . Pastor Williams has finally arrived . The viewing line starts to move faster and faster until Mrs. Brown is saying a prayer over Sandy 's body , and then it is our turn . <p> I take Nanny Rose by the hand and we walk to Sandy 's coffin , stand next to it , and peer over its edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , the shell of her  --  wearing her best dress and curly wig . <p> Only , our Sandy is n't in the coffin . In her place is a petite black man wearing a dark brown suit , a mustard yellow shirt , and a slightly darker yellow tie . Attached to the tie is a small metal pin shaped like a peacock . <p> " Why , we must be at the wrong viewing , " says Nanny Rose , but it is too late . I have looked closer and realized that no , we are at the right funeral . Placed in Sandy 's hand is a pink leather Bible , just the Gospels , with her  --  his  --  name stamped on it in gold . The Bible was a present from Nanny Rose for Sandy 's sixty-fifth birthday . Nanny Rose gave Caroline one just like it . <p> I make a quick decision . " You 're right , " I say . " This is n't Sandy . Let 's go . " <p> But no , Nanny Rose is peering into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy 's Bible . <p> She begins to shake her head . Gunther struggles in her arms , trying to get to Sandy , barking like crazy . I feel every eye in the church on our backs . <p> " I do n't understand , " says Nanny Rose . She is too confused to shush Gunther . " I gave Sandy that Bible . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I say , " I recognize it . " <p> Gunther is barking again and again at Sandy , and I surprise myself by reaching over and slapping his nose myself . <p> Nanny Rose clutches my forearm . " Louise , " she says , her voice cracking , " that is Sandy . " She lets go of my arm and points an accusing finger at the dead man 's head . " That man is Sandy . My Sandy was a black man ! " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I say . " Hush now , people are watching us . " <p> Nanny Rose 's eyes fill with panic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! That black man helped me into my girdle ! " <p> She hands me Gunther , who is still barking his head off , rolls her eyes toward heaven , and faints to the floor . <p> Copyright 2009 by Susan Rebecca White <br> Continues ...
