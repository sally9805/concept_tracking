As far as much of the U.S. is concerned , Rudy Giuliani was mayor of New York City for four months  --  from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , when he became a symbol of tough-minded resilience , to the end of his term . We in New York had a longer and more complicated relationship with him . Some loved the U.S. Attorney turned pol for presiding over a huge drop in crime ; some hated him for taking a prosecutorial attitude toward everything from race relations to his personal life . <P> America 's Rudy , meet New York City 's Rudy : that 's the idea behind the biopic Rudy : The Rudy Giuliani Story ( USA , March 30 , 8 p.m . E.T. ) . Giuliani 's story fit the standard three-act arc neatly . He rose to glory , busting crime first as a prosecutor , then as a two-term mayor ; he fell into ignominy by mishandling alleged police-brutality cases and dealing callously with the public disintegration of his marriage ; and he was redeemed by 9/11 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of and battle against prostate cancer . <P> The story begins near its end , as Giuliani ( James Woods ) , sagging in the polls and term-limited from running again , is about to be rendered a lame duck by the mayoral primary on Sept. 11 . When the attack comes , Giuliani 's efforts to organize the recovery and comfort the city are shot in jittery handheld video , giving the scenes a raw , home-movie look that meshes seamlessly with real footage of the Twin Towers burning and people leaping to their death . The audacious technique flirts with sensationalism but also slices through any jadedness about these all-too-familiar images . <P> Rudy intercuts the 9/11 scenes with a more ordinary bio story , which  --  perhaps appropriately for its workaholic subject  --  has a much better feel for his love affair with his job than for his human relationships . Giuliani 's wife Donna Hanover ( Penelope Ann Miller ) is an enigma , given little to do but express various flavors of exasperation . Woods , however , has Giuliani nailed , capturing his sarcasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woods ' 9/11 scenes convincingly show how the tragedy restored the mayor 's sense of purpose and made him America 's Rudy . If Woods errs at all , it 's because , unable to resist an actorly delivery , he makes Rudy a more dramatic speaker than he is . <P> The movie is based on a book by Wayne Barrett of the Village Voice , hardly a Giuliani ally , which fed suspicion that it might be a hatchet job . Yes , it makes Giuliani look like a jerk , but that 's both an insult and a compliment . You boo Rudy the jerk when he ends his marriage via a press conference , but you cheer Rudy the jerk when he pushes around insider traders and Mob bosses . Giuliani 's philosophy was that it takes a tough guy to run a tough city . If that does n't always come across prettily on screen , that  --  as Rudy should know well  --  is just tough .  --  By James Poniewozik              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
