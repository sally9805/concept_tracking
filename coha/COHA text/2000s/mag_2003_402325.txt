Impassioned Entertainment Weekly readers strike back , and your list goes to 11 . Why ? Well , it 's one longer , is n't it ? // IT STARTED AS A trickle . Then it grew-swelling larger and larger . Finally , like some brain-slurping , machete-wielding radioactive beast , it enveloped the EW mailroom , sending our writers and editors fleeing pell-mell in terror . Right now we 're writing this under our desks. * Our goal was to make entertainment weekly 's Top 50 Cult Movies , which hit stands in issue #711 on May 16 , as controversial and surprising as the movies themselves . Judging by your overwhelming response-several hundred letters , a good number with outraged lists of omission-we succeeded . We stand by our original selections . ( Yes , even The Shawshank Redemption . ) However , in the spirit of democracy and , of course , to honor the memory of overlooked master thespian Andre the Giant , here are EW readers ' top 11 choices for flicks that did n't make the cut the first time around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones As depicted in stories , the quest for the Grail is traditionally a quest for wisdom , inner strength , and self-knowledge . Good thing the Python boys did away with all that tedious mythic rubbish . Their unheroic anti-epic is a quest for nothing less ( and definitely nothing more ) than the absurdity at the heart of all human endeavor . But mainly , it 's just an excuse to be transcendently silly on the most basic level : a killer rabbit , a holy hand grenade , a chickenhearted hero named Sir Robin , a Frenchman who pitches livestock at hapless English knights . ( That 's KUH-NIGITS to you , Yankee . ) SIGNATURE LINE " We are the knights who say ... NI ! " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT Omitting Grail was harder than cutting down the mightiest tree in the forest with ... a herring ! Though one of the funniest ( and most quotable ) movies ever made , it was a mainstream cultural phenomenon . A comedy classic , we thought , not a cult classic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley Kubrick Old Stanley K. transforms Anthony Burgess ' bolshy novel for the sinny . A baddiwad malchick named Alex-played real horrorshow by Malcolm McDowell-gets cured of his brutal ways by being forced to viddy some most nasty films about the in-out in-out and the ultraviolence . In plain English : Clockwork is a movie about movies-and sex and power and music and Sovietism-that works as a head trip by driving for the gut . Consider it Kubrick 's most surrealistic feat . SIGNATURE LINE " He 's enterprising , aggressive , outgoing , young , bold , vicious . He 'll do . " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT Clockwork was seriously considered but ultimately scrapped due to Kubrick 's widely accepted status as , you know , one of the giants of modern cinema . 3 MOMMIE DEAREST ( 1981 ) Frank Perry Alex and his droogs may give you the heebie-jeebies , but they do n't hold a wire hanger to Faye Dunaway ( as monster mom Joan Crawford ) when she gets her hands on weapons of torment like a pair of scissors and a closetful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that posthumously redefined Crawford 's image , this ( supposedly ) true-life story of a totally effed-up Hollywood royal putting her kids through hell is the kind of Tinseltown train wreck you ca n't help but gawk at . Still , it 's mostly in the Horror Show Hall of Fame for the skin-crawling moment in which the cold-cream-slathered movie star gives young Christina a rude awakening , bellowing ... SIGNATURE LINE " NO ... WIRE ... HANGERS ... EVER ! " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT A judgment call . This is what keeps us up at night . There . Now you know . 4 THE PRINCESS BRIDE ( 1987 ) Rob Reiner It was a year crowded with slick yuppie comedies : The Secret of My Success , Baby Boom , Beverly Hills Cop II . Then this fantastical fairy story floated in . William Goldman 's script proved scandalously quotable , from ridiculous retorts ( " No more rhymes now , I mean it ! " " Anybody want a peanut ? " ) to whooping one-liners ( " Have fun storming the castle ! " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Under all the witty repartee , however , lies a surprising sweetness . At its heart , Princess Bride is a funny valentine , anchored by three magical words : " As you wish . " SIGNATURE LINE " My name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die . " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT In the interest of fairness , we limited each director to one movie on the original list . Reiner-bless his comic heart-was already represented at No. 1 with This Is Spin al Tap . 5 ( 1996 ) Doug Liman Jon Favreau , struggling young actor in L.A. , writes a movie about ... struggling young actors in L.A. Cliche , right ? But Favreau and Liman wound up doing for twentysomething men what John Hughes did for teen girls : Swingers nailed everything so well-from awkward pickup lines in bars to fistfights over videogames-that it was both hilarious and uncomfortable . It may have turned some of Hollywood 's finest watering holes into tourist traps and prompted untold thousands of young men to holler " You 're money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're willing to forgive it everything , if only for the scene in which Favreau goes through every stage of a relationship in a series of Increasingly panicky answering-machine messages . SIGNATURE LINE " You are so money and you do n't even know it . " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT It was ranked No. 51 . We swear . 6 UHF ( 1989 ) Jay Levey It is , perhaps , the most perfect expression of the " Weird Al " Yankovic sensibility , probably because it was written by and stars " Weird Al " Yankovic . ( And true geeks know that it was directed by his manager . ) That alone ought to earn UHF some serious cult credibility . We also have it to thank for alerting us to the talents of Michael ( " I 'm thinkin ' of somethin " orange ! " ) Richards . But that 's giving short shrift to the movie 's brilliant conceit : Al plays a good-hearted loser who engages his rerun-saturated brain in the creation of pun-driven pop fusions like Conan the Librarian . SIGNATURE LINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stinking badgers ! " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT Because we 've actually seen it . You should all be ashamed of yourselves . 7 VALLEY OF THE DOLLS ( 1967 ) Mark Robson Susan Sontag notwithstanding , it 's hard to think of a better definition of camp than 20th Century Fox 's candy-colored adaptation of Jacqueline Susann 's smash trash novel . ( Dolls , you 'll remember , are pills . ) With its scenes of addled vixens-alluring cosmetics queen Barbara Parkins , sultry softcore star Sharon Tate , and princess of perk Patty Dukepopping those little red jujubes and getting thrown into detox ( or worse ) , Dolls winds up a mostly plotless melodrama that traps a troupe of otherwise accomplished thespians in a web of hammy overacting . Among the vict ... er , ensemble : Susan Hayward , Lee Grant , Joey Bishop , Richard Dreyfuss , John Williams , Andre Previn , and Dionne Warwick . A studio production has never tried this hard to be so artfully good and wound up so deliriously bad . SIGNATURE LINE " Boobies ! Boobies ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but how many camp classics can there be on a single cult-movies list ? ( More , you told us. ) 8 ( 1999 ) David Fincher May 2000 . Reunion weekend at an Ivy League school . Guy sees a friend and slaps him on the shoulder , receiving a wince in reply . Seems he and his boys got together the night before and ... well , we 'll have to direct you to the signature line . Let 's just say , America , that your best and brightest are your black-and-bluest , and you may blame this adrenalized adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk 's novelistic manifesto . That the story is juvenile scarcely seems to matter when the camera zooms so juicily , stylizing male rage against corporatism , the culture of victimhood , and every yuppie 's pending date with IKEA . Nihilism plus testosterone equals trouble . SIGNATURE LINE " The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club . " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about its omission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstood masterpiece . 9 DEAD ALIVE a.k.a . BRAINDEAD ( 1992 ) Peter Jackson In olden times , giant rats hitching on slave galleys disembarked at Sumatra and raped the local tree monkey . Thus was born the Harryhausen-style " rat monkey , " whose bite spawns a mess of zombies in an uproarious splatterfest proving that before The Lord of the Rings , Jackson was one cheerfully sick pup . Pliers extract teeth , Mum eats her own ear , gawky hero Lionel cleans up with a lawn mower , and enough blood is spilled in the showstopping haunted-house climax to transfuse two T. rexes . Everything from Raiders of the Lost Ark to Holy Grail is referenced , and every color-saturated shot looks like a panel ripped from a comic book . SIGNATURE LINE " Your mother ate my dog ! " WHY WE LEFT ITOUT We love this over-the-top gorefest . We just happen to think Dawn of the Dead , Evil Dead II , and Re-Animator are more important . That 's right , important . 10 BETTER OFF DEAD ( 1985 ) Savage Steve Holland A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe in himself-thanks to the girl next door . What sounds like typical teen fare is actually a sharp satire that foreshadowed films like Heathers . After all , the boy ( John Cusack ) repeatedly attempts suicide , and the girl , a French exchange student , endures the advances of a Jell-O-y host teen ( Rick-yyyyy ! ) . It 's a freak show that makes adolescence look as painful as you remember it . SIGNATURE LINE " I want my two dollars ! " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT This might have been first , but Heathers was better . 11 DONNIE DARKO ( 2001 ) Richard Kelly Imagine an underdog comic-book fantasy . Collect the rawest memories of high school . Write an acid tab of a script . Utilize Duran Duran 's " Notorious . " Cast Jake Gyllenhaal as a 16-year-old kid who 's misunderstood and medicated for schizophrenia . You 've created Dannie Darko . You 've created a haunting teenage dreamscape that has already spawned jam-packed weekly midnight screenings . SIGNATURE LINE Says Donnie , " Why are you wearing that stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why are you wearing that stupid man suit ? " WHY WE LEFT IT OUT Donnie 's deserving , but just too new to crack the top 50 . It 's a shoo-in for our upcoming **29;2192;TOOLONG list , however . Just behind Harvey and ahead of , um ... <p>
