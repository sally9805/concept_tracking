Chapter 1 : Bye-Bye , Bombay I am Lowji Sanjana . I am a kid . I used to live in the country of India , in the big city of Bombay , in an apartment building with my ma and my bape and NO PETS ! That was the apartment building 's rule : NO PETS ! But not long ago  --  just weeks after my ninth birthday  --  I learned we were moving ... far away ... across the ocean ... to ... " America ! " exclaimed Bape . " America ? " I gasped . I did not believe my ears ! How could I leave my grandmother and my grandfather ? How could I leave my aunts and my uncles and my cousins ?
