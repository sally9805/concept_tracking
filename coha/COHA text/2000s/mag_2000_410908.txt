EXPERT SAYS DISEASE IS " AN EPIDEMIC " // YEARS after the AIDS epidemic devastated the lives of millions , many people still envision a White homosexual man when they think of the disease . The reality is more familiar : Picture your mother , aunt or closest Sister-friend . That 's increasingly the face of a person living with AIDS . The disease is the second leading cause of death for Black women aged 25 to 44 , eclipsed only by cancer , according to the National Center for Health Statistics . Many people consider AIDS to be one of the biggest threats to Black women 's health . While men have higher rates of HIV infection than women , rates have soared among Sisters . In 1992 , one in 160 Black women was infected with HIV , a rate more than 15 times higher than that of White women . Today , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports that Sisters account for more than half of the new HIV infections among women . The spread of AIDS is even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Newark , according to a 1994 report , AIDS is the No . I killer of Black women . According to another study , Sisters are one of the fastest-growing risk groups for HIV infection in Washington , D.C. That news does n't surprise health professionals . " It has never been just a gay male disease , " says Dr. Victoria Cargill , director of minority research , clinical studies in the office of AIDS research for the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . " In the late ' ' 80s , I began to see more Black women with AIDS . Today , it 's an epidemic . " Photograph Doctors such as Helene Gayle ( left ) of the Atlantabased Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) say Black women like Thelma Valerie Williams ( above ) , an HIVpositive mother of three and an AIDS activist , account for more than half of new HIV infections in the U.S. " Breaking down misperceptions about AIDS is one of the hardest tasks of health professionals , " says Dr. Gayle. // Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the scope of the disease and its devastation still shocks some people . She has treated Black women with HIV or AIDS who have had only one sexual partner and others who have had hundreds . One of the most heartbreaking stories the doctor has heard , she says , involves a 14-year-old Cleveland girl she diagnosed with HIV . The youth had been sexually active since the age of 12 and had been infected with four different sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) . - When I asked her how many partners she had , she started looking at her fingers , " recalls Cargill . " I said , " You ca n't count on your toes . Do you need a calculator ? ' Finally , she said , " I 've had 12. " 1 said , " One of the risk factors of HIV is having four or more partners each year . I told her she had the virus . Her response was , ' You have to die of something . " ' Stephanie Brooks-Wiggins took the news differently . The single mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out she had HIV . " I donated blood at my job and a counselor called me and said she needed to see me , " says the former personnel recruiter for a Baltimore bank . " She told me I had been exsed to HIV . I had never heard of it . I did n't know what AIDS was . " It was November 1986 ; Brooks  --  Wiggins had relocated to Maryland from her native New York City and had been married just six months . " I began thinking , " Why me , why now , when I have finally found someone I really care about and am beginning to build a life with ? ' Why was this happening to me ? " she says . " I was a newly married woman , and I had to inform my husband that I was HIV-positive . I told him . . . " If you want a divorce or annulment , I 'll understand . " ' Instead , her husband flooded her with support . Next , she disclosed her infection to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases , to reveal her condition to other relatives , her church family and friends . Like many people living with HIV or AIDS , she feared rejection . She believes she was fired from one job because her employer discovered her HIV status . " I was always afraid someone would find out the truth , " she says . " It was a very frightening time . " As is the case with so many other AIDS- and HIV-infected persons , Brooks-Wiggins says it was the stigma of the virus that prevented her from coming into the open . When she began to share her condition , she says , she could " feel " people wondering if she was a prostitute or drug addict . She could see their eyes searching her arms for tracks . " I was n't promiscuous . I was n't a drug user , " says Brooks  --  Wiggins . " I contracted AIDS through monogamous heterosexual sex . In those days , AIDS was considered a White , gay male disease . I was a single mother of three girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were talking about . " She still does n't know which former boyfriend infected her with the virus . But the 54-year-old woman says there have n't been many . Unfortunately , many Sisters make that same mistake , experts say . " Part of the problem reaching middle-class Black women who have achieved a certain level of success is that they think AIDS is for other women of color , " says Dr. Cargill . " They think if he 's a nice guy with a nice car and lives in a nice neighborhood , he could n't possibly be infected with HIV But HIV does n't care if he has a Rolex watch or if he went to the premier college in the land . it 's about risk behavior . " The doctor rates unprotected sex and intravenous drug use and sharing of injection equipment as the No.1 risk factors for contracting HIV . Dr. Helene Gayle , director of the CDCs National Center for HIV , STD and TB prevention , says some heterosexual Sisters become infected when they have unprotected sex with partners who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners who are bisexual . One study by the Michigan Department of Community Health interviewed 1,001 HIV-positive Black men in southeast Michigan , and it revealed that 36 percent of the Brothers who had sex with men also had sex with women . " We do n't talk about bisexuality openly , " says the NIH 's Dr. Cargill . " We have Joe Q. Public down the street who goes to another part of the city after hours and takes on another identity . Unfortunately , Black men who are bisexual are often in the closet and therefore engage in unplanned , secretive , high-risk behaviors . " In addition to the secretive behaviors that Black women are exposed to , some women voluntarily become involved in behavior that produces HIV and AIDS . One example is Thelma Valerie Williams , a 41-yearold mother of three who says she became an intravenous drug user as a youth . At 18 , she says she began snorting heroin , and when a girlfriend told her she could get a faster , more in Photograph Citing her experiences to educate others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the risk factors associated with HIV and AIDS. // tense high through injection , her method of choice became the needle . Although friends began to die from AIDS , Williams continued her destructive behavior . " I first heard of AIDS in 1982 , " says Williams , who now works as a spiritual support facilitator and case manager for STAR ( Sisters Together and Reaching ) , a faith-based program to help curb the spread of AIDS . " Quite a few of my Mends bad died , but it did n't scare me enough to stop sharing needles or having unprotected sex . I did n't care because I was an addict . " When Williams finally changed her life by giving up drugs and turning her life to God , it was too late : She was HIV-positive . " I was devastated because I bad embraced the Word , " says Williams . " I thought everything was going to be OK . " She credits her faith , her pastor and church family for her strength in coping with the disease . Williams has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted her life to telling people about AIDS . " I realized the Lord called me to be a witness for Him , " she says . " God took someone like me , a drug addict , and turned me into something to be used forhis glory . Anyone can get AIDS . It 's about encouraging those who are infected and affected and warning those who are n't . " For those Sisters ( and Brothers ) who are infected with AIDS , they can expect the disease to change their lives dramatically . It 's a reality Brooks  --  Wiggins wakes to each day . For eight years , the Baltimore woman showed no visible symptoms of the virus . Then , in 1994 , she contracted tuberculosis ( TB ) and learned that she had M-blown AIDS . She says she has had rashes all over her body . At one time , the welts itched so bad , she jumped into a shower of steaming water for relief Her hair has become straight and thin . Her TB medication made her break out in hives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two injections of medicine . Other changes have been even more devastating . The once-shapely woman has lost weight and muscle tone , dropping 30 pounds-from a size 16 to a size 10 . For a time , Brooks  --  Wiggins says she changed her clothes in private , afraid of her husband 's reaction to seeing her thinning body . But it was his emotional support that helped her erase her shame and focus on survival . " In living with this disease , at some point you learn to tuck your dignity away , " says the president of the People With AIDS coalition in Baltimore . " So many things happen to you that a negative person would think was disgusting . You lose control of your bowels . " While continuous efforts are being made to help victims survive the disease , ending the spread of AIDS is paramount  --  and that process , experts say , begins with education . In addition to being aware of the risk factors , Sisters should have places in their communities they can be tested confidentially . Churches and civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by serving as clearinghouses for information about AIDS prevention and substance abuse . " If you think back to the push for awareness of sickle cell disease or hypertension , there was no shortage of places to go for help , " says Dr. Cargill . " When it came to HIV , everyone got quiet . " Along with ending the silence , experts say prevention efforts must address socioeconomic factors , such as poverty , that discourage Black women from getting diagnosed and seeking treatment . " The epidemic disproportionately affects people who are poor , " says Dr. Gayle . " They have poor access to information , poor access to health care and services . " Currently , young African-Americans are particularly at risk of HIV and AIDS because their rate of infection continues to climb . When Dr. Cargill considers that reality , she thinks back to the angry 14-year-old girl who came to her office . She believes that if someone had warned the youth about the risk factors of AIDS , she might have lived . Brooks-Wiggins hopes that increased education and research will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she expects no panaceas . Instead , she concentrates on what she can control-the quality of her life . Between bouts of illness , she travels with her husband , spends time with her family and educates people about living with AIDS . She speaks candidly to whomever she can about the ravaging effects of the virus . As a result , a teen granddaughter carries a condom with her every day , even though she 's a virgin . Brooks-Wiggins says that 's the legacy she hopes to leave behind . " I 'm really pleased about that , " says the grandmother of nine . " Changing the world begins one person at a time .
