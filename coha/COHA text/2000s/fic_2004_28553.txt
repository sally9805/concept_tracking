Chapter One ADDY PIERCE HAD always believed in the power of intuition . That little voice had a purpose . Hard to explain , then , why she ignored it this particular day . She 'd worked on the Lawson case until after midnight , setting the alarm for four and leaving Mark asleep when she headed out the door for the office at five . She had just sat down at her desk with a cup of much needed coffee when she missed the file , remembered she 'd left it on the dining-room table . She was to be in court at ten o'clock , but she had enough time to run home and pick it up on the way . It was then that the little voice had sounded inside her . Send someone else . Looking back , this was the detail that continued to play like a CD track stuck on what-if . What if she had sent someone else to get the file ? Would they have told her Mark was at home ? Or taken pity on her and left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things had happened . Addy had been the one to drive to her house . The one to open the front door and notice his suit jacket draped across the back of the living-room couch . The one to hear his voice coming from upstairs . The words not clear from where she stood in the foyer , but distinctly his voice . Followed by a woman'slaugh . The voice inside Addy screamed . Leave . Turn around and leave . But eight years of practicing law had shown her that knowledge , once gained , can rarely be ignored . Standing there in the foyer of a house that already felt as if it did n't belong to her , a feeling of dread swept through her , weakened her knees , so she put a hand on the wall and stood for a moment , waiting for the room to stop its listing . Her feet moved of their own volition , the runner on the staircase deadening her footsteps . She followed the hall to the master bedroom , the voices drawing closer . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That in their own house , their own bed , he had n't bothered to close the door . How could he have been so comfortable that he left the door open ? Through that rectangle she watched the husband who was supposed to have been hers rest his cheek on the woman 's belly , rounded with child . Addy swallowed . Went absolutely numb as if someone had flipped a switch and obliterated all feeling inside her . Mark turned , as if he 'd felt her gaze . Shock skidded across his too good-looking face , then froze there . " Addy . What are you doing here ? " The question hung in the air , ridiculous , considering . The woman scrambled up - as well as a woman in her condition can scramble - and yanked the covers around herself with a well-sculpted arm . She was so young . She had the kind of skin that made Addy want to run out in search of face creams guaranteed to halt the aging process in its tracks . What was Mark doing with someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked out of the bed . Addy stared at her naked husband while the woman made no effort to hide the possessiveness in her own assessment of him . Mark reached for a robe where it lay on top of the thick comforter . Addy recognized it as the one she had bought for him at Bloomingdale 's for Christmas last year . A robe . She 'd given him a robe . Was that the cause of this ? The fact that their marriage had deteriorated to the point that she could n't come up with anything more exciting than a robe for a gift ? The room suddenly had no air in it . Her lungs screamed in protest . She was going to be sick . She turned and bolted down the hall . " Addy ! Addy , wait ! " Mark called out . She stumbled down the stairs . Do n't think . Not yet . Get out . Just go . Her throat had closed up , and her eyes burned with the need to cry . Not in front of him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please ! " He caught her in the foyer , his chest rising and falling with what looked more like agitation than exertion . Her gaze dropped to his ab muscles . A six-pack . Like those guys in the men 's fitness magazines . When had he started working out ? And he 'd lost weight , had n't he ? She realized then how long it had been since she 'd seen him without his clothes on . How long it had been since the two of them had made love . She felt a wash of mortification for what she now knew to be the reason . " We need to talk , Addy , " he said , a note of uncertainty in his normally confident attorney 's voice . She focused on the navy crest of his robe , the knot in her throat so thick she could barely speak . " Are n't we a little beyond the talking stage ? " " This is n't how I wanted to tell you , " he said , compassion edging the admission . Fury exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn him . " How long has this been going on ? " He looked away , then dropped his gaze , guilt etched in every angle of his posture . " I never wanted to hurt you , Addy . " ( Continues ... )
