For a decade starting at age 40 , headaches , chest pains , fainting spells , hair loss and severe anemia plagued Eileen Binckley . During that period , she consulted an internist , a rheumatologist , a hematologist and a neurologist . All declared Binckley healthy . It was n't until she was 50 that a therapist friend identified the problem : anorexia . <P> Unbeknownst to the specialists , Binckley had been spending every waking moment obsessing about food , her weight and ways to avoid eating . At times she consumed only 300 to 500 calories a day . She exercised compulsively , waking at 4 a.m. to take three-hour walks near her home in suburban Philadelphia . All that behavior is typical of patients with the eating disorder anorexia . But her doctors missed the symptoms because , she says , none of them had ever asked Binckley about her diet and lifestyle . <P> Anorexia is still considered primarily a young woman 's disease , but Binckley is among a growing number of aging Americans diagnosed with the disorder . Although statistics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anorexia , therapists and rehabilitation centers that specialize in eating disorders report that every year , they 're ministering to more middle-aged and older patients , mostly women . The condition strikes people across ethnic and economic lines . Says Margo Maine , a psychotherapist and an eating-disorder specialist based in West Hartford , Conn. , and a co-author of The Body Myth : Adult Women and the Pressure to Be Perfect ( Wiley ; 2005 ) : " Anorexia is an equal-opportunity disease . " <P> Two years ago , the Renfrew Center of Philadelphia initiated a program tailored to those at midlife and beyond with food problems . Along with sessions on nutrition and body image , the program addresses the particular challenges that older women face , from the normal signs of aging like wrinkling and sagging to marital issues such as divorce and domestic violence . The center found that when younger women are absent , older patients are more likely to focus on their own health rather than on nurturing their younger counterparts . <P> Marcia Johnson , 62 , of Wellington , Fla. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a diagnosis of anorexia a dozen years ago , although she now recognizes that she showed symptoms of it by puberty . Binckley and Johnson note that their nonstop focus on food and body image slowed down when they were cooking meals for their growing children . Then as middle age set in , a sense of loss  --  a feeling that 's particularly acute for anorexics at midlife  --  set off a flare-up . " The loss of order  --  brought on by a change in job status , marriage , children  --  can cause an anorexic 's symptoms to worsen , " explains David Herzog , director of the Harris Center for Education and Advocacy in Eating Disorders at Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital . The departure of her college-age children led to Johnson 's most dangerous bout . Unhappiness at work caused Binckley 's symptoms to kick in again . For others , it can be the end of a marriage or the start of menopause . Men are n't immune , and for them , the sexual dysfunction that can come with aging often serves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
