Chapter One Narrative of Gus Landor My professional involvement in the West Point affair dates from the morning of October the twenty-sixth , 1830 . On that day , I was taking my usual walk  --  though a little later than usual  --  in the hills surrounding Buttermilk Falls . I recall the weather as being Indian summer . The leaves gave off an actual heat , even the dead ones , and this heat rose through my soles and gilded the mist that banded the farmhouses . I walked alone , threading along the ribbons of hills . . . the only noises were the scraping of my boots and the bark of Dolph van Corlaer 's dog and , I suppose , my own breathing , for I climbed quite high that day . I was making for the granite promontory that the locals call Shadrach 's Heel , and I had just curled my arm round a poplar , preparing for the final assault , when I was met by the note of a French horn , sounding miles to the north . A sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy and not hear it  --  but that morning , it made a strange buzz in my ear . For the first time , I began to wonder about it . How could a French horn throw its sound so far ? This is n't the sort of matter that occupies me , as a rule . I would n't even bother you with it , but itgoes some way to showing my state of mind . On a normal day , you see , I would n't have been thinking about horns . I would n't have turned back before reaching the summit , and I would n't have been so slow to grasp the wheel traces . Two ruts , each three inches deep , and a foot long . I saw them as I was wending home , but they were thrown in with everything else : an aster , a chevron of geese . The compartments leaked , as it were , one into the other , so that I only half regarded these wheel ruts , and I never ( this is unlike me ) followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , to breast the brow of the hill and find , in the piazza in front of my house , a phaeton with a black bay harnessed to it . On top was a young artilleryman , but my eye , trained in the stations of rank , had already been drawn to the man leaning against the coach . In full uniform , he was  --  preening as if for a portrait . Braided from head to toe in gold : gilt buttons and a gilt cord on his shako , a gilded brass handle on his sword . Outsunning the sun , that was how he appeared to me , and such was the cast of my mind that I briefly wondered if he had been made by the French horn . There was the music , after all . There was the man . A part of me , even then  --  I can see this  --  was relaxing , in the way that a fist slackens into its parts : fingers , a palm . I at least had this advantage : the officer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's laziness had worked its way into his nerves . He leaned against the horse , he toyed with the reins , flicking them back and forth in an echo of the bay 's own switching tail . Eyes half shut , head nodding on its stem . . . . We might have gone on like this for some time  --  me watching , him being watched  --  had we not been interrupted by a third party . A cow . Big blowzy lashy . Coming out of a copse of sycamores , licking away a smear of clover . This cow began at once to circle the phaeton  --  with rare tact  --  she seemed to presume the young officer must have good reason for intruding . This same officer took a step backward as though to brace for a charge , and his hand , jittered , went straight to his sword handle . I suppose it was the possibility of slaughter ( whose ? ) that finally jarred me into motion  --  down the hill in a long waggish stride , calling as I went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whirl , this officer . He depended his head toward me in brief segments , the rest of him following in due course . " At least , she answers to that , " I said . " She got here a few days after I did . Never told me her name , so I had to give her one . " He managed something like a smile . He said , " She 's a fine animal , sir . " " A republican cow . Comes as she pleases , goes the same . No obligations on either side . " " Well . There you . . . it occurs to me if . . . " " If only all females were that way , I know . " This young man was not so young as I had thought . A couple of years on the good side of forty , that was my best guess : only a decade younger than me , and still running errands . But this errand was his one sure thing . It squared him from toe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " I am . " " Lieutenant Meadows , at your service . " " Pleasure . " Cleared his throat  --  twice , he did that . " Sir , I am here to inform you that Superintendent Thayer requests an audience with you . " " What would be the nature of this audience ? " I asked . " I 'm not at liberty to say , sir . " " No , of course not . Is it of a professional order ? " " I 'm not at  --  " " Then might I ask when this audience is to take place ? " " At once , sir . If you 're so inclined . " I confess it . The beauty of the day was never so lucid to me as at that moment . The peculiar smokiness of the air , so rare for late October . The mist , lying in drifts across the forelands . There was a woodpecker hammering out a code on a paperbark maple . Stay . With my walking stick , I pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I ca n't fix you up with some coffee , Lieutenant ? " " No thank you , sir . " " I 've got some ham for frying , if you  --  " " No , I 've eaten . Thank you . " I turned away . Took a step toward the house . Continues ...
