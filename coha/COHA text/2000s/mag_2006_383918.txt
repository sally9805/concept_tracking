Welcome the morning in a sunny garden corner with comfy furnishings and tasty breakfast treats Photograph Photograph // Sunrise is a promising time of day in the garden . Birds are singing , plants are speckled with dew , the air is fresh and fragrant . There 's no better place to enjoy it all than on a breakfast patio like the ones pictured here . What makes these patios work so well as places to watch the day unfold ? They 're small , with comfortable seating for one or two , and they 're private-layered plantings or walls enclose them , and several face breathtaking views . They 're primarily situated on the east-facing side of the house to take advantage of the rising sun 's warmth . Before your to-do list beckons and neighborhood sounds fill the air , take a moment to savor the morning 's stillness . While you 're at it , enjoy a cup of coffee or a cool fruit smoothie the color of sunrise .

The space is cozy , even on chilly mornings , because the golden sandstone pavers and east-facing walls absorb and radiate heat . A painted , weathered stone table and metal bistro chairs lend charm , while a container overflowing with white and blue pansies , lobelia , and red geraniums adds a spot of color .

" I love all the birds flittering around , " she says . " They 're especially active in the morning . " That 's also when sunlight filters through a canopy of ancient oaks onto a satellite patio . A table for two sits atop slate pavers interplanted with grass , while clematis sprawls over the adjacent shed . The space is especially peaceful at daybreak , when the air is filled with birdsong . Photograph // Underline a view Native plants such as agaves , barrel cactus , and saguaros bring the desert 's natural vegetation right up to the patio in a Tucson garden , expanding and framing the views . Because the patio faces south , it is warmed slowly as the sun rises through the mesquites and acacias that border the property . " In summer it 's a great place to be before the day gets too hot , " says landscape architect Rebecca Doxtater .
