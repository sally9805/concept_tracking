OUTFITTING Headnote These affordable waterproof suits beat the rain without breaking the bank . By DAN A. NELsON // For most of the hiking I do , rainwear is like insurance . It stays in the bottom of my pack most of the time , but I 'm mighty glad to have it when the skies open up . As with any kind of insurance , though , the real question is : Will I have enough coverage if I buy the least expensive policy ? To answer this question , we gathered three rainsuits priced less than $100 ( for a complete set of pants and jacket ) . The two least expensive suits are made of nonbreathable fabric , which gets stuffy if you wear it while hiking . The jacket of the third set is made from a coated waterproof/breathable fabric , which provides a greater range of comfort , but also costs a few dollars more . Testers Kari Bodnarchuk and Jack Igelman joined me in evaluating the suits ; we spent 4 months slogging down damp Pacific Northwest trails , through soggy New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appalachians . The reviews follow in order of ascending price . ( A ) Kelty Trail Unt $50 ( jacket ) ; $30 ( pants ) Unisex XS-XXL Weight ( men 's large ; mfr. /BP ) : 12 oz/ 12.3 oz ( jacket ) ; 6.5 oz/7 oz. ( pants ) Dependably waterproof , this close-fitting rainsuit is best for cool days when you do n't need much ventilation . On the rain-sodden trails of Washington 's Olympic National Park , the Trail Light proved both waterproof and watertight . The jacket sports hook-and-loop closures on the cuffs and a drawstring around the waist , both of which helped me seal out weather . The roomy hood provided full rain protection , though it could use more adjustability for a secure fit in windy conditions . The Trail Light is made from non  --  breathable , polyurethane-coated nylon , which is best for folks who do n't hike for hours on end in wet weather or who stick to chilly climates . The Trail Light 's only venting options ( besides the front zip ) are the mesh-lined pockets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their effectiveness as venting ports is minimized . The streamlined fit of the Trail Light garments drew rave reviews from Kari , who proclaimed this her favorite suit and ideal for active wear . Jack concurred , but also pointed out that the close-fitting jacket did n't let him layer up in colder temperatures . Kari and I both found the Kelty plenty durable , with no stressed seams or failing tape . Jack had some minor problems with the seam tape on the shoulders and had to apply a bit of seam-sealer after some rough outings in the rain-soaked mountains in North Carolina .

( B ) Pacific Trail Cascade $49 ( jacket ) ; $39 ( pants ) Unisex XS-XXL Weight ( men 's large ; mfr. /BP ) : 10.3 oz ! 10.7 oz. ( jacket ) ; 7.4 oz/7.6 oz. ( pants ) Waterproof and featherweight , this value  --  priced suit is perfect for outings when you might encounter short . hard bursts of rain . " Water beaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable water repellent ( DWR ) finish on this lightweight suit shed rain . Indeed , we found the polyurethane  --  coated nylon and taped seams reliably waterproof . The only chink in the armor came from the unisex fit , which might allow a bit of weather to sneak in . For me , the hood was too small-it did n't pull far enough over my face to keep water from running down my forehead . For Kari , the generous cut let " water and wind creep in around the collar and cuffs . " As with the Kelty , ventilation is limited . On mild-weather hikes in the Appalachians , Jack bemoaned the jacket 's lack of pit zips , which made the nonbreathable fabric too hot for long periods of strenuous hiking . I found I could get a bit of venting by opening the mesh-lined chest pockets , though this prevented me from using the pockets for storage . The pockets are relatively shallow , and items had a tendency to fall out if they were n't fully zipped . The pants feature knee-high zippers so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without removing your boots , a welcome feature in a rainsuit this price . Though the lightweight fabric is n't made for abuse , it 's sturdy and did n't show any problems during the test period . Contact : Pacific Trail , ( 800 ) 877-8878 ; www.pacific trail.com .

( C ) Cabela 's Dry-Plus Tech Parka 11 and Dry-Vent Pants $79.95 ( jacket ) ; $19.95 ( pants ) Unisex S-XXXL Weight ( men 's large ; mfr. /BP ) : 18.4 oz. 18.6 ox ( jacket ) ; 6.1 oz/.2 oz ( pants ) Breathable fabric and reliable waterproof ness for less than $700 make this package hard to beat Made from Cabela 's proprietary Dry  --  Plus waterproof/breathable fabric , the Tech II jacket was breathable enough that I could use it for more strenuous activities than the other jackets in the test . On a backcountry ski trip that started in sunshine and ended in 2 inches of rain , I stayed remarkably comfortable . The Dry  --  Vent pants , made from nonbreathable , polyurethane-coated nylon , shrugged off water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DWR finish reliable , Kari reported that her jacket stopped beading after several washings . Jack praised the wicking ability of the parka 's mesh lining . " Even when the coat was totally soaked from rain and sweat , the mesh made it more comfortable to take off and put back on , " he said . Kari and I were fans of the pockets : three outer chest pockets and two inside security pockets hold an assortment of small items ( from snack bars to a small camera ) . We also liked the full-coverage , easily adjustable hood ( a single drawcord creates a snug , secure fit ) , which could be completely removed for those who prefer hats or umbrellas . The tradeoff is a heavier garment overall , but the combination of good detailing and a breathable jacket prompted Jack and me to dub the Cabela 's suit our favorite of the test .
