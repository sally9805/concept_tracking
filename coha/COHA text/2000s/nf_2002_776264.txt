It was ten minutes past three in the morning , and Kevin Lewis looked like he was about to pass out . There were three empty martini glasses on the table in front of him , and he was leaning forward on both elbows , his gaze focused on his cards . The dealer was still feigning patience , in deference to the pile of purple chips in front of the martini glasses . But the other players were beginning to get restless . They wanted the kid to make his bet already  --  or pack it in , grab the ratty duffel bag under his chair , and head back to Boston . Hell , had n't he won enough ? What was a college senior going to do with thirty thousand dollars ? // The dealer , sensing the mood at the table , finally tapped the blackjack shoe . " It 's up to you , Kevin . You 've had a hell of a run . Are you in for another round ? " // Kevin tried to hide his trembling hands . Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he was n't even slightly drunk . The red splotches on his cheeks had been painted on in his hotel room . And though thirty thousand dollars in chips was enough to make his hands shake , it was n't something that would impress the people who really knew him . They 'd be much more interested in the ratty duffel bag beneath his chair . // Kevin breathed deeply , calming himself . He 'd done this a hundred times , and there was no reason to think that tonight would be any different . // He reached for three five-hundred-dollar chips , then glanced around , pretending to look for the cocktail waitress . Out of the corner of his eye , he saw his Spotter . Red-haired , pretty , wearing a low-cut blouse and too much makeup . Nobody would have guessed she was a former MIT mechanical-engineering major and an honors student at Harvard Business School . She was close enough to see the table but far enough away not to draw any suspicion . Kevin caught her gaze , then waited for her signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bet . Both arms folded and he 'd push most of his chips into the betting circle . Arms flat at her sides and he 'd drop down to the lowest possible bet . // But she did n't do any of these things . Instead , she ran her right hand through her hair . // Kevin stared at her , making sure he had read her right . Then he quickly started to gather his chips . // " That 's it for me , " he said to the table , slurring his words . " Should have skipped that last martini . " // Inside , he was on fire . He glanced at his Spotter again . Her hand was still deep in her red hair . Christ . In six months , Kevin had never seen a Spotter do that before . The signal had nothing to do with the deck , nothing to do with the precise running count that had won him thirty thousand dollars in under an hour . // A hand in the hair meant only one thing . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duffel bag over his shoulder and jammed the purple chips into his pockets . // The dealer was watching him carefully . " You sure you do n't want me to color up ? " // Maybe the man sensed that something was n't right . Kevin was about to toss him a tip when he caught sight of the suits . Three of them , coming around the nearest craps table . Big , burly men with narrow eyes . No time for niceties . // " That 's okay , " Kevin said , backing away from the table . " I like the way they jiggle around in my pants . " // He turned and darted through the casino . He knew they were watching him from above  --  the Eyes in the Sky . But he doubted they would make a scene . They were just trying to protect their money . Still , he did n't want to take any chances . If the suits caught up to him  --  well , everyone had heard the stories . Back rooms . Intimidation tactics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town got , deep down , this was still Vegas . // Tonight Kevin was lucky . He made it outside without incident , blending into the ever-present flow of tourists on the brightly lit Strip . A minute later , he was sitting on a bench at a neon-drenched cabstand across the street . The duffel bag was on his lap . // The redhead from inside dropped onto the bench next to him , lighting herself a cigarette . Her hands were shaking . " That was too fucking close . They came straight out of the elevators . They must have been upstairs watching the whole time . " // Kevin nodded . He was breathing hard . His chest was soaked in sweat . There was no better feeling in the world . // " Think we should quit for the night ? " the girl asked . // Kevin smiled at her . // " Let 's try the Stardust . My face is still good there . " // He put both hands on the duffel bag , feeling the stacks of bills inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Kevin 's bankroll , partially financed by the shadowy investors who recruited him six months before . They had trained him in mock casinos set up in ratty apartments , abandoned warehouses , even MIT classrooms . Then they had set him loose on the neon Strip . // Most of his friends were back at school  --  taking tests , drinking beer , arguing about the Red Sox . He was in Las Vegas , living the high life on a million dollars of someone else 's money . Sooner or later , it might all come crashing down . But Kevin did n't really care . // He had n't invented the System . He was just one of the lucky few smart enough pull it off ... // Copyright ? 2002 by Ben Mezrich // Chapter Two // Boston , Present Day // Twenty-five thousand dollars in hundreds , strapped to each thigh . Another fifty thousand in a Velcro bag taped to my chest . Fifty thousand more stuffed into the pockets of my jacket . A hundred thousand nestled against the small of my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man and a drug dealer . Bulging and nervous , I pushed through the revolving glass door and entered Logan Airport . Refrigerated air smacked me full in the face , and I paused , getting my bearings . Terminal B was bustling with college kids fleeing town for the long Memorial Day weekend : backpacks , baggy jeans , baseball caps , duffel bags . Everyone moving in every direction at once , the unchoreographed ballet of a modern American airport . I took a deep breath and joined the flow of people . // I kept my eyes low , watching my scuffed dark loafers pad across the tiled floor . Act casual , think casual , be casual ... I tried not to think about the new BMW strapped to my back . I tried not to think about the down payment for a two-bedroom condo nestled in my jacket pockets . I concentrated on looking like everyone else ; maybe not a college kid , but perhaps a grad student , a teaching assistant  --  someone 's older brother here to help with the luggage . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly FAA report . Act casual , think casual , be casual ... // Suddenly , the modern equivalent of Stonehenge loomed in front of me : two airport metal detectors standing side by side , flanked by waist-high conveyor belts continuously feeding into boxy steel X-ray machines . My pulse rocketed as I mentally checked myself . No bills hanging from my sleeves , no glimpses of green sticking out through the buttons on my shirt . I stepped into line behind a pretty brunette in low-riding jeans , even offering to help her hoist an oversize , sticker-covered suitcase onto one of the conveyor belts . Act casual , think casual , be casual ... // " Next . " A tall African-American woman in a grey Logan uniform beckoned . There was a name tag on her right lapel , but I could n't make out what it said because of the sweat stinging my eyes . I blinked rapidly  --  but casually  --  and stepped forward through the disembodied door frame . The invisible rays sliced and diced my entrails in search of metal . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore through the dead air . I froze . // The woman with the name tag pointed me back through the machine . " Empty your pockets of any metal objects and try again . " // My throat constricted . My hands jerked instinctively toward the bulges beneath my jacket . Above the stacks of hundred-dollar bills , I felt something shaped like an enormous suppository . // Shit . I had forgotten about my cell phone . // My fingers shook as I reached into my coat and fumbled for my Nokia . I could feel the woman 's eyes on me . If she asked me to take off my jacket , I was dead . She 'd see the bulges and all hell would break loose . I 'd spent the past six months researching stories involving attempts at sneaking undeclared fortunes through airport-security checkpoints , and I knew all about customs law . // The security agents can detain you for forty-eight hours . They drag you to a windowless room , sometimes handcuff you to a chair . They call in agents from the DEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without even giving you a receipt . It will take lawyers and letters and appearances in court to get the money back . Maybe six months , maybe a year . Meanwhile , the IRS will descend on you like grey-suited locusts . It will be up to you to prove you were n't planning to trade the cash for little bags of fine white powder . Because to customs agents , money smells like cocaine . Especially hundred-dollar bills . I 've read that 95 percent of the hundred-dollar bills in circulation have minute traces of cocaine embedded in their fibers . That means those specially trained customs dogs can sniff out a professional blackjack player faster than they can spot a drug courier . To the dogs  --  and the customs agents  --  they both smell the same . // Fear soaked my back as I handed the woman my cell phone . She looked at it like she 'd never seen one before . She turned it on , turned it over , then handed it back . Behind me , a kid in a tie-dyed sweatshirt tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman with the name tag rolled her eyes . Then , thankfully , she waved me past . // " You 're okay . Have a nice flight . " // I was barely breathing as I stumbled toward my gate . America West , flight 69 . Boston to Vegas direct , the Friday-night neon express . A line of people had already formed by the check-in desk ; boisterous , drunk , mostly male , palpably eager . // Kevin Lewis was waiting quietly near the back of the line . I spotted him immediately . Tall , athletically built , but with a slight , shy stoop to his shoulders . Dark hair , dark eyes , a wide , boyish face beneath a mop of dark hair . Vaguely ethnic , but beyond that , indeterminate . His roots could have been Asian , Latino , even Italian or Russian . Like me , he was older than most of the college kids boarding the flight , but he easily fit in with the crowd . He could have been twenty-one , twenty-six , or thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have passed for a BU frat boy . In a suit and tie , he would have blended in on Wall Street . At the moment , he was wearing an MIT sweatshirt and baggy shorts . The classic MIT stereotype , right out of his parents ' dreams . // He saw my flushed cheeks and smiled . " That 's what it felt like . Every day . " // The bravado seemed incongruous with the shyness in his shoulders . In many ways , Kevin was the classic MIT stereotype . His re ; sume ; was perfect : a math-science whiz kid who 'd graduated at the top of his class from Exeter , the exclusive New Hampshire boarding school . An electrical-engineering major with an incredible affinity for numbers , a straight-A student who 'd covered all the premed requisites  --  partially to appease his father , partially because the challenge excited him . // But Kevin 's re ; sume ; did n't tell the whole story . There was another side to his life , one written in neon signs and purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 's at MIT. // In Vegas he 'd partied with Michael Jordan , Howard Stern , Dennis Rodman , and Kevin Costner . He 'd dated a cheerleader from the L.A. Rams and gotten drunk with Playboy centerfolds . He 'd been chased off of a riverboat in Louisiana and watched a teammate kicked out of a Las Vegas casino . He 'd narrowly escaped being thrown into a Bahamian jail . He 'd been audited by the IRS , tailed by private investigators , had his picture faxed around the globe by men with shadowy reputations and guns holstered to their waists . // Along the way , he 'd amassed a small fortune which he kept in neat stacks of Benjamins in a closet by his bed . Although nobody was quite sure how much money he had made , it was rumored to be somewhere between one and five million dollars . All of it legal , none of it spawned from his perfect , stereotypical re ; sume ; . // Shy , geeky , amiable Kevin Lewis had led a double life for nearly four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // " The Velcro 's starting to itch " was all I could think to say as I shook Kevin 's hand . " There 's got to be an easier way to carry your stake . " // He grinned , his head cocked to one side . " Sure . Fake umbrellas . Phony laptop computers . Plaster casts and hollow crutches . We went through a gadget phase . You know , James Bond kind of stuff . But hollow crutches are a lot harder to explain to the FBI than Velcro . " // If there had n't been a quarter million dollars taped to my body , I 'd have thought he was joking . But Kevin was dead serious . He was keeping his part of our bargain , disclosing the secrets no one on the outside had ever heard before . // I met Kevin Lewis nearly seven years earlier , in a local Boston bar . I had graduated from Harvard a few years before he left MIT , and we shared a few mutual friends as well as a few minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widescreen TVs . I was a fledgling writer at the time of our introduction , just about to publish my first novel . As far as I knew , Kevin was employed by some sort of computer software firm , something he had never explained in detail  --  probably because I had never been interested enough to ask . // Kevin seemed too much the typical MIT grad : a true engineer at heart . As my writing career began to take off in the years that followed our first meeting , we rarely crossed paths . It was almost six years later that we ran into each other at a Super Bowl party in an apartment located a few blocks from Fenway Park . Kevin had just flown in from a " business " trip to Las Vegas . During the game 's halftime show , I found myself alone with him in the kitchen . After a quick exchange of pleasantries , he surprised me by lowering his voice and beckoning me in close : " I 've got a great story for your next book , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit . Like every other writer , I had heard this opening a thousand times in my career . Everyone had a story he believed worthy of a best-seller ; for me , reality was rarely interesting enough to take the place of fiction . // But as Kevin began to open up to me , I felt the hair rising on the back of my neck . Unlike the thousands of other cocktail party stories I had heard , Kevin 's tale had all the elements of a high-concept , cinematic thriller  --  but it was real . Everything Kevin was relating to me had actually happened . He had lived it , every minute of it , and he was willing to let me get it all down on paper . // " Why ? " I had asked , amazed . // Kevin never answered my question directly . Over time , I 've tried to piece together an answer of my own . // Kevin had been part of something incredible . He and his friends got away with one of the biggest schemes in Vegas history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telling the story was his way of reliving the experience in a public forum . It was a way for him to prove to himself and to anyone who cared that it had actually happened . // More than that , it was a way for Kevin to come to terms with the choices he had made , the decisions that had led him to his double life . Many of those choices might have seemed immoral to the outside world . By telling his story , Kevin could explain himself to those who believed that what he did was somehow wrong . // In other words , his story was part boast , part confession . For me , this was too good a story to pass up . // As the Super Bowl played on in the other room , Kevin made me an offer . He promised to tell me everything , to give me access to his contacts and his lifestyle . He promised to teach me his system and show me the key that could unlock the casino 's coffers . // In return , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delved into Kevin 's double life , the more I realized how far I had come out ahead in our bargain . When I finally sat down to put the words onto paper , Kevin 's story flashed by my eyes in Technicolor as bright as a Vegas marquee ... //
