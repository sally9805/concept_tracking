If the military campaign does n't want the name " Operation Infinite Justice " because of its religious allusion , perhaps the mammoth investigation into the Sept. 11 terror attacks should adopt it , simply for accuracy . The name certainly fits , what with 7,000 FBI employees and countless state and local police officers following some 63,232 leads in the case . FBI Deputy Director Tom Pickard , a key figure in the case against the 1993 World Trade Center bombers , and the bureau 's top man in New York , Barry Mawn , are running the investigation from Washington and two secret locations in Manhattan . Detectives and intelligence agents around the world are pitching in . The flow of data is crushing ; every day brings new leads  --  and new dead ends . But answers to some of the most important questions are beginning to emerge . <P> HOW LIKELY IS ANOTHER ATTACK ? <P> Federal agents have already turned up some worrisome evidence . One discovery that causes shivers : among the belongings of suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui , sources tell TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be used to spray lethal biological , chemical or radiological toxins into the air . On Sept. 16 the government temporarily grounded all crop dusters and warned farmers and pilots to put even their most modest planes under guard . <P> Rumors lit on every tongue last week ; the most unsettling focused on Sept. 22 . Because Dr. Al-Badr Al-Hazmi , 34 , a Saudi national who is being held as a material witness , had made three reservations to fly to San Diego via Denver on that date , people worried that terrorists would hijack another aircraft . ( As it turned out , Al-Hazmi 's two extra tickets were in the names of his wife and child . ) More ornate scenarios had the bad guys finishing off New York City with a suitcase nuke or poisoned water supply . But the day passed , mercifully , without incident . <P> Still , no one is breathing easy . Top law-enforcement officials believe that associates of the hijackers remain tucked away in American communities . Senator Bob Graham of the Intelligence Committee said last week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of horror . No one can say how many other terrorist cells may be sleeping near our homes , but Osama bin Laden , the prime suspect in the attacks , has trained thousands of terrorists . Last week authorities were determined not to let anyone build on the destruction  --  or escape punishment for it . By week 's end , at least 100 people had been arrested in the U.S. in possible connection to the attacks , and 230 more were wanted for questioning . <P> Bin Laden has cells around the world ; the next attack could come overseas  --  especially with the U.S. so vigilant . According to the German Secret Service , as many as 1,000 of bin Laden 's soldiers have infiltrated Europe after completing their training in Afghan camps . Closer to home , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has identified some 350 individuals who it believes aid terrorist organizations .
