<p> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 's visits to the White House and meetings with top administration officials increased sharply after President Bush took office in January 2001 , according to records released to an academic researcher under the Freedom of Information Act . <p> As terrorism and war replaced concerns about financial instability as the top-tier threats to the U.S. economy , Greenspan broadened the group of officials with whom he maintains frequent contacts to include national security adviser Condoleezza Rice , White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell . <p> Greenspan , as a matter of policy , declines to publicly characterize his private consultations with other officials . The Bush officials with whom he met also declined to discuss the substance of the meetings . <p> But Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said Tuesday that Greenspan met with administration foreign policy officials to discuss international economic policy . Particularly since the U.S. invasion of Iraq last year , Middle East instability and its potential effects on the world oil supply have been key concerns . Another frequent topic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . <p> " The chairman believes a central mission of the Federal Reserve is to contribute in whatever way possible to the stability of the American economy , " Smith said . " Although they are unelected officials , the Federal Reserve must be accountable to the American people as it undertakes that effort . " <p> Greenspan met more frequently with Treasury officials during the Clinton administration than during the Bush administration , the records show . Smith , who worked at the Clinton Treasury Department before joining the Fed , noted that international economic policymaking was more concentrated at Treasury in the Clinton administration . <p> Since the 1950s , when the Fed 's independence was firmly established , its chairmen have generally taken pains to maintain their distance from the executive branch . The Fed 's ability to conduct monetary policy without regard to political fallout is thought to be key to its credibility in financial markets . <p> Greenspan has always maintained public contact with administration officials . But the Fed was seen as so independent early in his 17-year tenure as chairman that some in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 1992 election loss to Bill Clinton . <p> President Bush said last week he is nominating Greenspan to a fifth term as chairman . This comes as the Fed has signaled it will soon start raising interest rates to stave off higher inflation . <p> Greenspan 's frequent contacts with the Bush administration do raise questions for Kenneth H. Thomas , a lecturer in finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania . " There 's the appearance that Greenspan might not just be affected by economic winds , but possibly by political winds , " said Thomas , who obtained records of Greenspan 's appointments back to 1996 through the Freedom of Information Act , and who published his findings in an article in the American Banker last month . <p> Thomas praised Greenspan 's performance as Fed chairman , but noted that Greenspan provided critical support for the Bush tax cuts , and now advocates making the tax cuts permanent . In a presidential election year , Thomas said , Greenspan 's close contacts with the administration " become at least a potential appearance problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and historic shift , " said Donald Kettl , a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and author of a book about political influence on the Fed . <p> Kettl said the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and subsequent war probably led to more discussions between Greenspan and foreign policy officials " because of the fear that terrorism could have a dramatic impact on the economy . " But even accounting for that , the numbers indicate " a stunning rise and increase in the level of communication , and one only wonders what they were talking about , " Kettl said . <p> Fed chairmen have been very careful to " avoid deals or the appearance of deals " with an administration , Kettl said , " because financial markets were always waiting for signs that the Fed had crawled into bed with the Treasury , which would mean high inflation . " <p> Tom Schlesinger , executive director of the Financial Markets Center , a nonprofit organization that seeks to educate the public about the Fed , said that without more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to tell what conclusions you could fairly draw from the fact that the number of meetings have gone up . " <p> However it is clear from Greenspan 's public comments in recent years that he has been concerned about the effects of " geopolitical tensions " on the global economy , U.S. financial markets and American businesses and households . He told members of Congress early last year that the Fed was struggling to determine how much of the economy 's sluggishness then was due to uncertainty about global oil supplies , terrorism and other international risks , and how much was due to underlying domestic economic developments . He and other Fed officials worried then that another serious shock could derail the halting recovery . <p> The picture of Greenspan scouring the Bush administration for details on global developments fits with his public image as a man with a voracious appetite for economic information . He is well known for immersing himself in obscure economic measures and dispatching Fed staff to canvass businesses about their plans . <p> But Greenspan 's methods clearly changed after Bush took office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House Council of Economic Advisers about as often during Bush 's years as he did in the four years of President Clinton 's second term . However the number of appointments with other White House officials jumped sharply with the new administration , from an average of three per year from 1996 through 2000 , to 44 per year in 2001 through 2003 . The chairman has already made 12 such visits in the first three months of this year , the latest data available . <p> The chairman has met with Vice President Cheney at least 17 times since early January 2001 ; Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , 11 times ; Rice , 12 times ; Card , six times ; Powell , once ; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz , twice ; and Cheney 's chief of staff , I. Lewis Libby , once , according to the Fed 's copies of Greenspan 's schedule . <p> Greenspan had at least four official appointments with Cheney and one with Rumsfeld before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records whether Greenspan might have had more such meetings , since a number of appointments are described only as " White House meeting , " or " White House lunch , " without specifying the participants . <p> Michael Bradfield , who was the Fed 's general counsel under Greenspan 's predecessor , Paul A. Volcker , said he could not recall any meetings between the famously independent Volcker and the Reagan administration 's secretary of defense , deputy secretary of defense or national security adviser . Volcker did meet with Vice President George H.W. Bush to discuss a White House proposal to reform the financial system , Bradfield said . Volcker did not return calls for comment . <p> Greenspan met with Treasury officials more frequently in the last five years of the Clinton administration , an average of 55.4 times a year , compared with 45.3 times a year during the first three years of Bush 's presidency . <p> The chairman 's appointments with other government officials  --  defined as department and agency heads , financial regulators and state officials  --  also rose noticeably in recent years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records show . <p> Greenspan 's official visits with Capitol Hill lawmakers , excluding public testimony , also have picked up in recent years , averaging about 21.3 per year in 1996 through 1998 , then surging to an average of 35.8 per year since 1999 . <p> Greenspan has known Cheney and Rumsfeld for decades , having served with them in previous Republican administrations . Before Sept. 11 , Greenspan was already calling more frequently on the White House and various cabinet secretaries , including then-Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill , another longtime friend from the Ford administration and private business . <p> " Vice President Cheney has known Alan Greenspan for many years in a variety of roles , throughout their careers , and the vice president has high regard for him , " said Cheney 's spokesman Kevin Kellems . " In terms of the content of their meetings , I do n't know what they discuss . One would assume that a number of current issues of mutual interest would come up . But there 's nothing more I can do to accurately describe them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional acquaintance that they 've maintained over the years , " Lawrence T. DiRita , the chief Pentagon spokesman , said Tuesday . " They see each other from time to time . That 's not unusual . It 's a meeting without an agenda . They enjoy each other 's company , they respect each other 's intellects , and it 's private  --  there 's no staff in there when they meet . " <p> Powell 's contact with Greenspan is " largely social , " said State Department spokesman Richard A. Boucher . " They 've come to know each other socially over the years . They do n't discuss interest rate policy . But I think the secretary is always interested in how Greenspan sees the world economically , and Greenspan is interested in how the secretary sees the world diplomatically and politically . " <p> Greenspan also has a personal connection with Wolfowitz , whose father was one of the chairman 's professors at Columbia University . <p> Spokesmen for Card and Rice declined to characterize the content of their meetings . <p> Staff writer Paul @ @ @ @ @ @
