Classy , edgy , and a cheap date to boot  --  you might end up making a long-term commitment . POWDER DAY Grab the Summit Platter lift , dive into the back side 's Whitehorn 1 chute , and catch Paradise Chair . Traverse to the wind-deposited fluff in Crow Bowl and Ptarmigan Chutes . Then ascend Ptarmigan Quad , plunder the front side 's Eagle Trees , and regain the Platter . Repeat until lactic acid spills from ears . 3 DAYS LATER Check avy conditions and then cross Louise 's open boundary to the 800-vertical-foot shots in West Bowl . Or hike for an hour to the top of 8,902-foot Lipalian Mountain and bag Elevator Shaft  --  a 1,300-foot , in-bounds sluice ride that tips 50 degrees at its crux . FUEL The locals ' favorite Outpost Pub ( 403-522-3989 ) has cheap , high-grade bar food . Fondue at the Walliser Stube ( 403-522-3511 ) is pricey , but the atmosphere does n't feel , ahem , cheesy .

DRINKING AND DANCING True nightlife lies 38 miles east , in the clubland of Banff , but the glitter ball spins locally on Friday nights at the Lake Louise Inn 's Explorers Club ( 403-522-3791 ) . BACKCOUNTRY ACCESS Great , legal backcountry skiing lies just steps beyond the boundary rope . Check avy conditions , strap on your beacon and thinking cap , and hike over Lipalian to the broad cirque of Purple Bowl , home of the Canadian Powder 8 Championships . ESSENTIAL GEAR Arrive before February without your rock skis and the Louise 's stone-strewn terrain will make you a custom pair . Grab your circa 1990 Pre 's . MUST KNOW Do n't hit snooze when the report says three inches of new snow . Thanks to Louise 's topography and winds , a mere sifting at the base frequently translates to boot-high drifts on the back side .
