Ask Alexander Karelin to name his greatest challenge , and he will tell you about the time he outwrestled a refrigerator that weighed nearly twice as much as he did . Clamping a bear hug on the appliance , the 6-ft. 3-in. , 286-lb . Russian hoisted it off the floor . " It was a huge fridge , " he recalls , " and I carried it to my apartment up eight flights of stairs . " <P> Humans have even less of a chance against Karelin , 32 , a super-heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler who has won gold medals in each of the past three Summer Games . In fact , the Siberian native has never lost in international competition . His streak extends 13 years , an astounding record . No wonder Karelin is a bogatyr  --  a folk hero  --  in Russia , where he represents his home town in the Duma ( the Russian parliament ) and holds the rank of colonel in the customs police . <P> And just what  --  besides massive size  --  makes him virtually invincible on the mat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director for U.S. wrestling , " he 's maybe inhumanly strong . " American wrestler Matt Ghaffari , 38 , who has spent his career trying to defeat Karelin , can unhappily vouch for that . In Atlanta the 6-ft. 4-in. , 286-lb . Ghaffari wept in frustration on the silver-medal stand after he extended Karelin into overtime , but still lost . " I wrestled my heart and soul out , " he says . His performance was so moving that he is now sought as a motivational speaker . He can certainly speak to never giving up : he is 0 for 22 against the Russian . <P> Strength is paramount in Greco-Roman wrestling , which does n't allow a competitor to take down an opponent by attacking his legs . That places a premium on lifts and throws . Such tactics are common in lighter weight classes , but Karelin  --  " King Kong " or " The Experiment " to fellow wrestlers  --  is the only super heavyweight with the strength to hoist a 290-lb. foe and fling him to the mat , in a maneuver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute it , Karelin locks his arms around the waist of an opponent , then lifts the wrestler like a sack of potatoes and , arching his back , heaves the hapless fellow , feet first , over his head . <P> Just the thought of such punishment can make men quake . Take the ' 92 games in Barcelona , where Karelin dispatched two frightened challengers in the semis and finals without breaking a sweat . Both opponents obligingly rolled onto their back to avoid being lifted and airmailed . " They were so afraid of that , " says Hull , " that they practically let themselves be pinned . " <P> For all his glaring menace , Karelin  --  who weighed 15 lbs . at birth  --  has a gentle side . A fan of opera ( particularly Mussorgsky ) , ballet and theater , he is especially fond of poetry and has written verse . This Bunyanesque figure is a husband and the father of three children , including a daughter who was born this year .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
