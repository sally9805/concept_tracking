Is this the year West Nile strikes with a vengeance ? Back in the spring , public-health officials were divided over how bad this summer 's outbreak would be . Last year the mosquito-borne disease resulted in more than 4,000 cases and nearly 300 deaths , and heavy spring rains led some local experts to predict a mosquito baby boom and an explosion of cases in 2003 . But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) was more cautious . The outbreak was likely to be as bad as last year 's , said the CDC , but because diseases like West Nile spread so unpredictably , nobody could say for sure whether the disease peaked last summer or was still getting worse . <P> Now we 're headed into the virus 's late-summer sweet spot , and the CDC reported last week that the number of West Nile cases has begun to shoot up  --  right on schedule . By week 's end , 470 cases  --  and 10 deaths  --  had been reported in the U.S. , in 25 states from Florida to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the previous week and nearly twice as many compared with the same time last year . <P> But the CDC was right to hedge its bets . The number of West Nile deaths was actually slightly higher last year at this time . That , say CDC officials , probably reflects the fact that more people are being tested and milder cases are being reported . " A quarter to a third of the cases last year were considered mild . This year it 's up to half , " says Dr. Tony Marfin , a CDC scientist who specializes in West Nile disease . <P> The virus 's primary hot zone has also changed . Last year the most dangerous part of the country was the lower Mississippi River basin , including Mississippi and Louisiana . This year the action has shifted to Colorado , which had only 14 cases and no deaths in all of 2002 but already has nearly 250 cases and six deaths so far this year . Part of that shift is due to the nature of mosquito populations , which tend to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . <P> But it also reflects the fact that West Nile has been moving inexorably westward since it arrived in the Northeast in 1999 . Diseases tend to expand their range until something stops them , and because this one is transmitted mostly by mosquitoes , which live in every state , there 's not much stopping it . ( It can also be transmitted by blood transfusion , but on July 1 , the Food and Drug Administration authorized two experimental tests now being used on the nation 's blood supply . ) <P> There 's still a chance that the outbreak will peter out this summer , but not much of one . " At this point , " says Stephen Ostroff , deputy director of the CDC 's National Center for Infectious Diseases , " we have every reason to believe that the 2003 outbreak will be just as severe as last year 's , and that one was unprecedented . " With a few hundred deaths a year , West Nile is n't likely to become a major killer anytime soon . But it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
