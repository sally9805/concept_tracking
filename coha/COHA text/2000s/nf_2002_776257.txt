The Experience of Depression // What is it like to be depressed ? The experience varies widely but to put it simply : when you 're depressed you might feel as ill as when you have the flu , but it 's a mysterious process because there is a sense that although you should be able to shake it off , you learn that there is little you can do to overcome it . If you 're depressed , you may feel so isolated that the world seems a strange and hardened place . No matter what you do , it does n't seem to help you or anyone else . Your natural habits of thinking and behaving calmly are not there when you need them . You wonder , " What is wrong with me ? " What 's worse , you do n't see any way out ; you could become convinced that you are going to remain in this state of discontent the sinkhole forever . The idea that it will pass on its own or that there might be light at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stop believing it . // What if you 're not depressed yourself , but someone close to you is ? As you may already know , depression is n't a disease that affects only the person who has it . Depression can drain the confidence that family members , loved ones , and coworkers have in the person . That loss of trust would be bad enough , but most people suffer from depression , often for years , without any idea that they are ill. // In the pages that follow , I 'll be talking about the progress we 're making in treating patients with depressive illness restoring them from the seemingly hopeless situations . Slowly  --  too slowly  --  the world of medicine is recognizing clinical forms of depression and manic depression as devastating diseases which benefit from treatment . The good news is that we are actually able to help increasing numbers of patients . But it 's not enough . Greater understanding of these illnesses through research will allow us to help a greater number of people who are suffering . In the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more people with depression and manic depression . The fact is that most people in need of help are never diagnosed , and , thus , never treated . We can talk all we want to about statistics and rigorous scientific studies , and we 'll be referring to them as we go along . But I also hope to describe the people with depression : what it 's like to experience the gnawing pain and terror in the faces of those with the illness . I want readers to understand how difficult it can be for patients to accept the slow progress of treatment and rehabilitation . // How Do You Know If You 're Depressed ? // What we know about the experience of depression often comes after a depressed person has gotten better . The fact is , it 's difficult for many depressed patients to give an account of their illness when they are depressed . They are working hard trying to manage their feelings and their responsibilities , and at the same time trying to figure out what is wrong with them . At their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when they may feel better , and they assure themselves that the episode has passed and they are okay . But then suddenly it is back , worse than before . Inevitably , these changes and moodiness can confuse and disrupt any continuity in work or in relationships . The confusion of the illness affects their ability to see things as they are . // Depression is an episodic illness . Episodes can last for weeks or months or years , and are interspersed with more or less symptom-free periods . They often wax and wane with external ( seasons ) or internal ( hormonal ) changes . // One of the most disabling aspects of depression is that often you do n't know that you have it all . That does n't happen with most other painful diseases that are usually quick to announce their presence and location . But depression can sneak up so insidiously that you literally do n't know what it is , sometimes until years later . This was what happened to late night talk show host and writer Dick Cavett . Newly arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to launch his career on the Great White Way . The only trouble was that he could n't get out of bed . " I 'd stay between the sheets until three the next afternoon . And if I were really brave and heroic I would haul ass out of the apartment and take the laundry down , and that made for a big week . And that lasted six weeks . It seemed like spring cured it . I was sure I had a degenerative disease from looking at my face in the mirror , and most of my organs were rotting inside . " // Once the depression was over , though , he says , " It was inexplicable . I could n't remember that I 'd had it or why I 'd had it . It did n't even seem real that I 'd had it . " He described the experience as being under a " horrible black heavy dreary authority . " The depression , he said , seemed impossible to lick . " This will last the rest of your life , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work for you . You will die unloved and despairing in a garret even if you 're a Rockefeller . " He admitted to envying cancer patients he saw when he was at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital . Even though they had little time left , they were still interested in life . They cared about their families and their friends and still rooted for the Yankees ( or prayed fervently for their comeuppance ) . But Mr. Cavett could n't summon the energy or the will to care about anything or anyone . // Although being economically and socially deprived may play a role in the development of some depression , celebrity status , worldly success , good looks , and intelligence offer no protection from it . Most people who have lost a spouse to divorce or death or a friend or a cherished coworker will go through a period of bereavement , the length and intensity of which is related to how close they were to the deceased . However , this painful experience is not a clinical depression . Bereavement is normal and it serves as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . In some ways the rituals surrounding death are intended as celebrations of the life of the deceased . There are happy memories to be shared , and laughter as well as tears . Going through these rituals makes it easier for people to say good-bye to their loved one and then get back into their lives , even if their lives are never the same again . // On the other hand , for people who are genetically predisposed to depressive illness , even a small loss  --  a stolen camera , a raise , or a promotion delayed by two weeks  --  can trigger a ferocious depression . Those who are predisposed to depression , no matter how successful they are , can wake up one day unable to get out of bed and wonder how on earth they got to that point . // For someone who has never been hit with the illness before , it 's difficult to distinguish between simply feeling down and being clinically depressed . Art Buchwald , the noted humorist and syndicated columnist , had a period of depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he assumed it was just a case of the blues . " Then , " he said , " the blues went away . " He soon learned , though , that depression was n't just a matter of feeling low on a rainy afternoon . The next episode of depression hit him so hard that it left him thinking that something was " seriously amiss . " Having come through one episode without much trouble and then being struck down by a second left him confused and worried , Buchwald noted , " So you really do n't know where you are in this business . " // So exactly where are we in this " business " ? How can anyone know when they have depression before they wind up collapsing or being hospitalized ? You may imagine the worst but , it 's important to remember that depressive disorders vary enormously in severity , duration , and frequency of episodes . // Doctors and patients who have lots of experience with the disease would say they judge the clinical meaning of the symptom by the company it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know , for instance , that in clinical depression , mood is usually down but  --  and this is important to note  --  not necessarily sad . Self-esteem and self-confidence go down , often dramatically . // We have to acknowledge that diagnosing depression is not as simple as it is with many physical ailments . A doctor might examine you and conclude with reasonable accuracy that you have heart disease or diabetes . To be sure , he or she must order blood tests or X rays or CAT scans , whatever is warranted . When it comes to depression , there 's a significant difference . Clinicians can distinguish the symptoms of depression and if they 're trained and observant , they can make a diagnosis that will serve as the basis for successful treatment . I can not stress often enough that treatment is usually quite effective . What we do not have , though , are lab tests that can confirm the diagnosis ; no blood test , X ray , or CAT scan will greatly increase the certainty of a clinical diagnosis of depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests . We often do so to find a cause for the depression when we suspect that a stroke or low thyroid functioning might be the cause . Whether the head MRI is normal or abnormal it does n't change the diagnosis of depression . They simply say that a stroke did or did not produce it . // On what basis then can we assess whether someone is depressed ? We have three basic criteria . Depression is characterized by 1 ) symptoms that involve changes in mood , vitality ( physical and mental liveliness ) , and self-regard ( self-esteem and self-confidence ; 2 ) that it runs an episodic course , and 3 ) that it tends to run in families . // Feeling Low // The hallmark of severe depression is an inclination to despair . If you 're depressed , you tend to feel worthless and that it 's only a matter of time before everyone else finds out . The prospect of receiving help may fail to lift your spirits . As Mr. Cavett put it , " you know you 're depressed when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet you do n't have the motivation to get out of bed and take it . " When a depression is severe , the patient truly feels worthless , useless , and possibly hopeless about the future . " Everything was black , " recalls Buchwald , " the trees were black , the road was black . You ca n't believe how the colors change unless you have it . There 's just no color . It 's scary . " // How do most doctors ( and patients who have had depression already ) know that clinical depression is n't the same as being in a bad mood ? How do they know that depression does n't represent a normal response to some terrible event ? Maybe your dog did die , maybe you did lose your job  --  those are the kind of events that would probably make you feel bad . But depressed ? If you have n't been there , then you might not suspect that there 's much of a difference . Sooner or later , you 'd suspect , you 'd pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on with your life . Even physicians can be guilty of not being able to distinguish the difference . " I once went to a psychiatrist , " Cavett recounted , " and I said , ? I 'll do anything , get me out of this. ? And he said , ? I know what you 're going through . When one of my parents died I went through awful grief. ? ? Do you think grief is anything like depression ? ? I told him . Go with the grief , it 's better . In grief , you 're at least feeling a rich , deep feeling . In depression you do n't even have that , it 's just that awful drone of nullity. " // An awful drone of nullity . That 's not sadness . It 's worse than that . For many people , when they have depression , it 's hard to feel anything . " I was totally without feeling , " Cavett says . " I went to the dentist . And I thought , ? This is great : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll feel something. ? And it did . But not as much as if I were not depressed . So in some sense I was already anesthetized . " And that sense of being anesthetized or deadened is what I mean by the soul of depression . You feel despondent with no hope for the future . // Feeling Drained // Depression saps your ability to concentrate or think clearly . People with depression often find it difficult to comprehend what they 're reading . They have to read the same lines over and over because nothing sticks in their minds . One of my patients complained that he could only read " words "  --  one at a time  --  but was unable to take in a whole paragraph . For some people with depression , it 's even a struggle to keep track of what 's being said in a conversation . In a very severe depression , thinking becomes muddled and confused . // When you 're depressed , physical vitality also declines and you tend to feel fatigued much of the time . You lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting started in the morning is extraordinarily difficult , and you do n't have the energy to do things that normally would be second nature to you . You have decreased ability to perform tasks that demand concentration or a mental effort . This inability can transform even minor challenges into major crises , especially at work . Depending on the severity of depression , you 'll probably get through most days , but with difficulty . It might take six hours to accomplish what you would normally have done in two or three . You might make more errors , and your performance may become inconsistent . Your physical and mental vitality also varies depending on the time of day . The most typical pattern in depression is to feel worse in the early morning hours and better during the evening . // The change in vitality can take the form of physical symptoms , too . People who have arthritis or are prone to headaches may find that their symptoms worsen . In some cases they may develop new symptoms . People with depression will often become overly preoccupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be merely an inconvenience . Inconsequential aches and pains are viewed as harbingers of a serious threat to their health . In the most severe forms , depressed individuals might become convinced that they have a fatal illness like terminal cancer or AIDS. // Usually depression causes sex drive to diminish or disappear altogether . Pulitzer-prize-winning novelist William Styron , who suffered a severe bout of depression , reported that he lost confidence in his psychiatrist when the psychiatrist hesitated to use a particular antidepressant because it might diminish Styron 's sexual functioning : Styron admitted to being bewildered by the psychiatrist 's attitude . " He could n't possibly have any idea of what I had , if he thought that I was interested in a little carnal fun . " // Appetite can also change in depressive illness . In the most severe depressions , patients were classically thought to lose their appetite , restrict their eating , and experience considerable weight loss as a result . But , at least an equal number of depressed people , including many people with bipolar disorder who are in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weight . Overeating is also seen in people who have seasonal depression cycles or who have long-standing but moderate depressions . ( This can be particularly problematic for whose self-esteem is closely tied to their weight , who might require medications that increase their appetite . ) About one-third of the people with depression , however , have no particular change in eating habits or weight . // Sleeping habits during depression vary considerably ; sleeping can increase as well as decrease . Sleep often increases for people who suffer from seasonal and chronic depressions compared to episodic and extreme forms of clinical depression , in which loss of sleep is more common . Typically depressed individuals have fewer problems falling asleep but find that staying asleep is a real problem . They 'll often wake up by three or four A.M. and find it very difficult to get back to sleep . // Feeling Worthless // Our feeling of self-regard or self-esteem is a part of our everyday inner life . It normally varies , even if only by a little bit , depending on the challenges and frustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did my wife really understand that I did n't mean to forget her mother 's birthday ? If I work overtime will I feel like a fool if the boss does n't notice ? These are the types of situations into which self-criticisms from depression , can creep without raising any alarms . Only when significant and obvious changes occur are we finally warned that a real problem exists . // ( Continues ... ) //
