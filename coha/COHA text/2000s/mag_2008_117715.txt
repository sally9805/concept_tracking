Double Down // In Las Vegas , Roush Fenway Racing held the hot hand as Carl Edwards won his second straight Cup Race // LAS VEGAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY may not have the history of Daytona , the intensity of Bristol or the mystique of Talladega , but this 10-year-old track , laid out in a desert valley north of the Strip , does boast one thing those more celebrated venues ca n't : It hosts the single most revealing race of the Sprint Cup season . If a team can win on this 1.5-mile , D-shaped speedway on the third race weekend of the year , chances are it is going to excel in the 12 other races on intermediate-length tracks the rest of the season ( including six in the Chase ) . And that 's the key to winning the Cup . // " Las Vegas is a great barometer for us , " says Alan Gustafson , the Hendrick Motorsports crew chief for Casey Mears , noting that the season-opening Daytona 500 is run on a 2.5-mile superspeedway and the second race is held on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There are a lot of long runs here , pit strategy is critical , and you 've got to have a good motor to make it to the end . The cream always rises here . " // Indeed , in four of the last seven years the eventual Cup-winning driver won at Vegas  --  a trend that bodes well for the title hopes of Carl Edwards , who took the checkered flag in Sunday 's UAW-Dodge 400 . It was Edwards 's second win in as many races , and his ascendance to the top of the point standings is reflective of the rise of Roush Fenway Racing this season . ( The number 99 Ford passed postrace inspection , but because of an " issue "  --  the lid was off the oil tank box  --  NASCAR may hand Edwards a minor points penalty . ) RFR drivers finished first , third ( Greg Biffle ) and seventh ( David Ragan ) at Vegas , and that performance confirmed what owner Jack Roush has been saying for weeks : RFR no longer trails Hendrick in what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got our asses kicked last year by Hendrick , " says Biffle . " We got sick of it , made changes and worked our tails off to get where we are today . " // During a team meeting last May , Roush apologized to his crew chiefs and drivers for not testing the new generation of car as vigorously as his rivals did before the 2007 season . As a result , none of the RFR drivers were serious Cup contenders . It was n't until midway through last season that Roush launched a dedicated , eight-man test team that traveled to tracks in Iowa , Virginia , Tennessee and Wisconsin , laying down laps in the new car and analyzing data . // The work paid off , as Edwards gave Roush Fenway two CoT wins , at Bristol on Aug. 25 and at Dover on Sept. 23 . And RFR 's performance on Sunday at NASCAR 's most telling proving ground indicates that the gap between Hendrick and the other elite teams is closing quickly . While Hendrick 's Dale Earnhardt Jr . chased Edwards to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas , a harrowing accident knocked Jeff Gordon out of the race , and Jimmie Johnson struggled throughout , finishing 29th. // " I love intermediate-length tracks because I love the pace of laps , " says Edwards . " Plus , now we 've got just really good cars for these types of tracks . I just hope it continues . " // Bet on it .
