Last month this CD earned the funky , brass-heavy horde of Chicagoans a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Jazz Album , but Ken Burns and Wynton Marsalis might not file it under " Jazz . " Foremost a dance band , Liquid Soul makes improvisation take a backseat to grooves aimed at shaking backsides . Sadly , the band freights the album 's first half with uninspired chants , and the self-conscious guest vocals by Simone , daughter of Nina , add more sandbags to the balloon . Later on , when everyone shuts up and lets the horns do the singing , it 's easier to get up and dance . <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent
