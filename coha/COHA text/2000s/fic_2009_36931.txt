So close . So damned close . But it was not to be . Not yet . Tremayne had felt the violent shift in power as a rare opportunity eluded his grasp . Seeking patience , he tried to focus on the woman 's words . <p> " What ? So petty theft , greed , conspiracy and assault are n't enough for you ? " Daphne Forbes , who gripped the cornerstone that had nearly fallen into Tremayne 's welcoming hands , glared down at her father lying sprawled in the dirt . " Obviously not . I 've read your damn journals , which brought me all the way over here , today of all days . " She gestured widely at their rustic surroundings . They were , in fact , all standing in a clearing in the middle of Albemarle State Park in suburban central Virginia-an absurd location for an official Druid grove . " But did you also have to ruin my shoes ? " Daphne swept that same hand downward to point at said shoes . The toe of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a badly aimed cornerstone . " Damn it , these were my going-away present to myself , and not exactly chea- " <p> She broke off as a blinding light seemed to emanate from her center and radiate outward . Her eyes glazed , rolling back in her head as her knees buckled . <p> And then it happened , just as he 'd expected . Tremayne restrained himself from moving forward into the light , wanting nothing more than to get his hands on- <p> A crackle of energy , a wash of sparks , and heavy smoke obliterated all view of Daphne and the stone . Tremayne heard gasps and alarmed muttering from behind him , from all the other assembled players in this drama , but he ignored them and just waited in silence . He knew he could not interrupt the process , much as he might wish to do so . <p> As the smoke dissipated , he stepped forward to peer carefully into its foggy depths to locate first the cornerstone . He grabbed it from the ground and shoved it into the pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze beyond , to address whatever disaster had befallen the woman . <p> And that 's when he saw . Taken completely aback , he could n't help but smile , in spite of the circumstances , in spite of all he 'd just lost . There , where Daphne once stood , was a pretty , cream-colored cat , eyes spitting rage and terror . She 'd left one scuffed red shoe behind . That would plague her with every shape-shift , he predicted . At least , until she learned control . <p> Gently , expecting claws , he plucked the cat from its perch atop the shoe and lifted it high so he could peer into the familiar , crystal blue depths of Daphne 's eyes . " So . It appears my work here is not yet done . " That should piss her off completely . <p> Her eyes flared , proving him correct . <p> Stifling his amusement , he cradled the cat close , felt Daphne 's growing indignation even through her silky feline fur . " Easy , sweetheart . I will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting his lips drift gently over the delicate tip of one ear . Then he closed his eyes and let his powers consume him . <p> His was a dampening force . A walking power vacuum , he could undo magic and nullify it . Druids called upon his kind only as a last resort . He was dangerous to them and to all magical creatures . <p> But not to Daphne . Not yet . <p> Traces of puca magic crackled against his skin , intensifying as he worked on Daphne . He experienced a wavering of time , space and matter , all shifting and reforming . Then he felt the definite dig of human fingernails-not kitty claws-as Daphne pinched and scratched at him , seeking release . He felt her heart racing like a trapped wild thing , and she shoved herself free to pat herself up and down her clothed and again-human form . <p> Allowing the retreat , he watched closely as she strove to collect every scrap of her usual composure . She managed , too . Although she sometimes underestimated herself , Daphne Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever encountered . Until now she 'd been merely an untutored hereditary Druid , a human female who did n't want-did n't even know how to use-her inborn powers . <p> Probably a good thing , he decided as she glared at him . " You just watch where you put those hands . Got it ? " she snapped . Pivoting on the pointy toe of one elegantly shod foot , she hobbled off into the trees . <p> He wondered what she made of her missing shoe . <p> Still shaking , Daphne forced one foot in front of the other . The path . Where was the freaking path ? She was so completely out of here , both shoes or not- <p> " Ms. Forbes . " A commanding voice from behind . Not Tremayne 's . Yeah , and speaking of freak ing things , what the hell was Tremayne ? Obviously he was not simply the mysterious private detective her mother had hired to tail her philandering and apparently criminal father . Daphne should have known there was more to him than what first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drawn so compulsively to anyone before in her life . Not to Warren , her one-time boyfriend and almost fiancT , and not to any man before or since then . She 'd ignored them . Easily . Once burned , twelve times shy . <p> But since she 'd first spotted him a couple months before , Tremayne had proven to be completely , disturbingly un-ignorable . Not only was she constantly aware of him on an elemental level , but it seemed there was no avoiding the man , period . He was everywhere , either one step ahead of her or almost on her heels , watching her , watching her parents . He drew her eye , her thoughts , her near obsession , in spite of her well-founded mistrust of interfering types . She hated feeling that way about any man . The lack of control galled and stunned her . It struck her as unnatural-and should n't that have been a tip-off ? Where was her head ? No doubt about it , Tremayne had a whole lot more going on than a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Daphne Forbes . Please . I realize you 're unsettled by what just happened here . Let us help you . " <p> She slowed and turned to look over her shoulder . It was that Druid guy her father hated , Phil something . He was also the High Druid , which would make him , in her opinion , the cult leader . If the crowd thought she was getting naked and submissive with that , they were as nutty as white-robed fruitcakes . Which they were , actually . <p> Well , the Druids were white robed . The puca and the faeries were dressed like any other schmoes on the street . Pucas and faeries . She felt like an idiot even silently acknowledging-Okay , sure , she 'd read of the existence of such ... beings ... in her father 's journals , and she 'd actually met two guys who claimed to be pucas , but faeries ? Tinkerbell ? She 'd probably be doubting still-a smart girl did n't believe everything she read-if she had n't just now watched a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple snap of his fingers . Just poof , and two women had appeared out of nowhere . <p> To think that most people had no idea they coexisted with beings like this . Other than model-perfect faces and bodies , these pucas and faeries looked human . That was so wrong ! Where were the pointy ears and magic wands and slanting , googly eyes ? Was a tail or pair of hooves too much to ask ? The fact that freaks could walk among humans , controlling them , manipulating them , when humans were completely unaware of their existence or interference ... It was intolerable . Daphne backed away from them all . <p> " Oh , no . I 'm done with you weirdos . Do what you will with Daddy Dearest and his conniving and violent ways . He asked for every bit of justice you want to drop on his power-hungry head . Just count me out . " She turned and kept walking . Where had the path disappeared to ? It was here , right here , just a moment earlier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil said . " I am not asking you to intercede for him . I am concerned , however , that you might spontaneously shift-shape again . " <p> She froze . Spontaneously ... " You 're kidding me . " So , the cat thing could happen again ? <p> But she had n't really changed into a cat . How could she have ? Sure , she knew of the existence of shape-shifters-in myth and legend and , well , hearsay-but she was human . Humans did not change shape . So , obviously she 'd just ... had an episode . Or something . Maybe it was something she 'd eaten . Or maybe that stupid cornerstone had really bounced off her head and done cerebral damage before landing on her foot . That would explain much . Like the zinging she still felt along her nerve endings , as though they were all conversing energetically . What would nerve endings have to discuss anyway ? She could just imagine : Hey , how 's the weather on your side of her ass ? Kind of chilly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely chilly about that ass of yours , said a voice out of nowhere . <p> She caught her breath . Tremayne 's voice ? She was thinking about her own ass in Tremayne 's voice ? That was just wrong . <p> So you did hear me . That answers all questions . <p> What did that mean ? Maybe she was in shock . Or dealing with aftereffects from her episode . Was it an aneurysm ? A stroke ? <p> It means that you retain the puca powers that were discarded by the former puca Riordan , used by your father for foul purposes and then bound so temporarily inside that cornerstone . Those powers are now loosed from the stone ... and tied to you . You wield the puca powers . <p> She whirled to glare at Tremayne , who stood unmoving , off to the side . " Are you insane ? " <p> No . And before you ask , neither are you . Mindspeak is a puca power , as is shape-shifting . It 's apparent you have a strong natural talent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . That 's all on you . " She pointed a finger at him . " You 're the freak around here , not me . I 'm human . I do n't ' mind-speak ' and I do n't turn into a wolf after dark . The only ' powers ' I wield involve math , taxes and the IRS . So why do n't you go find more of your kind and loiter somewhere ... metaphysical . But leave me out of it . I have a flight to catch . " <p> " I 'm afraid we ca n't let you do that , Ms. Forbes . " It was High Druid Phil again , his calm almost exaggerated . <p> Daphne scowled . " Funny , how you have absolutely no say in the matter . I 'm outta here . Now , where the hell did the path go ? " <p> " It will return when the time is right . " <p> She whipped around to face Phil . " Return ? What , the path is gone ? You made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a Druid . Your type can do stuff like that . Guess that means I 'll have to strike out on my own . Cross-country and all . " <p> Steeling herself , she made a sharp left , kicking aside brush and ignoring the sharp edges of rocks and sticks beneath her bare foot . Stupid missing shoe . Had the cat eaten it ? Her thoughts stumbled clear of that mental sidetrack . <p> Shoving through branches and brush that seemed to grow thicker , she felt perspiration dampening the material between her breasts . A drop of moisture slid down her spine . It was winter in Virginia-albeit a mild one-and here she was sweating all over her silk blouse , thanks to a misguided and badly timed attack of conscience . <p> She would smell utterly rank by the time she set foot in the airport . And oh , look , a fresh stain on the sleeve of her blazer . Damn it ! So much for getting her seat upgraded to first class . <p> She reached up with both hands to grasp a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed right back into the Druids ' circle ? <p> They all patiently looked at her , thirty or so assorted males and females , all dressed in white robes and representing probably every walk of life , not to mention every brand and style of footwear . Also present were that handful of supposed faeries , a puca and a few non-Druid humans . All were staring at her . It was like Halloween , except scarier and with no candy to make her feel better . And they were all standing in that damn circle , right where she 'd left them . <p> Which she would do again . Stoic , she turned her back on the group and raised a hand to shove at another branch . <p> " It wo n't do you any good . " Phil spoke quietly . " Every path you take into the trees will lead back to this circle until I give you permission to leave . " <p> Daphne 's temper flared . Great . Another damn control freak of a Druid . Like she had n't seen enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they acted out the Druid version of War of the Roses . But did n't the warring spouses in that movie end up mercifully broken and forced to stare at each other as they expired ? Like she could possibly get so lucky . No , if there was dying to be done in the Forbes household , her parents would undoubtedly crush Daphne between Mommy and Daddy so all three could expire simultaneously . On their terms . Never hers . She was so done with possessive control freaks , that right now she felt capable of- <p> Careful , Daphne . Your temper . You have undisciplined powers . If you hurt the Druid , even by accident , the penalty will be very high . <p> She glared at Tremayne . " Do you think invading my mind will make me any less inclined toward violence ? " <p> Amusement glittered in his eyes . <p> He thought this was funny ? Funny ? <p> " Well , it is really refreshing to see someone as composed as you completely lose your temper . I imagine you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made a scene like this in front of anyone , " he replied . <p> She narrowed her eyes . " If that 's your way of suggesting I take it easy and be a nice girl , I 'm very much afraid your efforts are backfiring . " Very afraid . Very , very-Her breath hitched . Oh , god . She felt it again , the zings racing along her spine and veering outward to pelt various nerve endings . <p> Tremayne abruptly strode toward her . Unnerved by the force of his presence and her usual reaction to it , she backed up a step . But he kept coming until he stood just a pace away . His face expressionless and his manner calm , he gripped her shoulders with both hands . The zinging , which had accelerated to a mind-robbing frenzy , slowed and then dissipated . Daphne exhaled shakily , gazing sightlessly around the clearing . She would n't meet his eyes . <p> " Daphne . " Tremayne murmured her name . " Look at me . " <p> Gritting her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm looking . What should I see ? " <p> Dark , nearly black eyes , fathomless depths she 'd always found so unnervingly compelling , stared down at her . Calm overtook her . Oh . She inhaled deeply , drinking it in , and let her breath out slowly . <p> " Better ? " <p> Strangely enough , it was . She eyed him warily . " What happened ? Why is ... " She gestured shakily at him and her and their silent audience . Everyone else seemed willing to let Tremayne deal with her , crazy as she was . <p> He smiled . " You 're not crazy . You just have a lot to accept . Including the powers Duncan Forbes batted at you . " <p> " My father ? " She gritted her teeth as shattering confusion realigned into insane logic . In a charged game of keep-away with a brick-sized cornerstone , her errant father had made a grab for it but managed only to swat it toward a clump of bushes . Those bushes had concealed an eavesdropping but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's all because of that stupid cornerstone-the one he stole from those puca brothers and chucked at me . He 's the reason I did the cat thing . All because he thought he could use the trapped powers to replace Phil as head of this weirdo glee club . " She glared at her father . <p> " Take it easy , Daphne . It 's not that he does n't deserve your anger , or that karma would object to a little vengeance against him . But if you lost your temper completely , well ... " Tremayne 's words dwindled , as though he were still in search of ones that would n't completely blow her mind . <p> " Will I spontaneously combust ? Channel my inner feline ? Turn the Druid grove into a smoking crater ? " she asked . <p> Tremayne tipped his head thoughtfully . " Maybe . " <p> He could only be referring to all of the above . She licked her lips and could feel her heart racing again . <p> " The puca powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's just say it 's a volatile mix . Unpredictable . Anyone who gains powers such as these , especially with the background you have ... " <p> " You mean psycho parents ? " <p> " That would be it , yes . Basically , we need to keep an eye on you and contain potential damage . That will be my job . As it has always been . " Tremayne cast a less-than-friendly glance at High Druid Phil . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
