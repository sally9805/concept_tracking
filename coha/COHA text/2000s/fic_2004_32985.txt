Ursula On a crystalline , perfectly blue morning in June , after a day of angry pewter skies and of sheeting , driving rain , we enter our story . Clouds pile themselves picturesquely , theatrically , like plump odalisques , against the blue , clear-edged and astonishing . The forest all around is a palette of greens . Wild chokecherry trees are in raucous bloom . It is as if this were the first morning of the world , perfect . Even the garter snakes slithering under roots , over rocks , over roots , through the grass seem a part of the day 's jubilance . Dew on fat ferns catches the sunlight in bursts and disperses it , starlike . We are just miles inland from the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan , which juts out into Lake Superior , the arrival point for the earliest hardy wide-eyed settlers arriving from the East on lake packet boats to stake claims and seek copper , well before the Civil War . Lifting off from a branch overhead , a red-winged blackbird calls out clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native word for " portage . " Many things here that are not called Keweenaw are called its English equivalent , Portage , almost as if life were much like a brief transit across a wee stretch of land . It is Monday , June 9 , 2003 . Our story itself began long before , if we believe that all back story is also story , that the underside of the iceberg explains what we see above : all those wind-sculpted shapes that , looking for all the world like praying hands , came to be called , by fanciful meteorologists , nieves penitentes , or penitents sculpted of snow . Still , a painful and highly unusual event happens this glorious morning , and it is through this tiny aperture that we enter our narrative . We are at the moment seeing through the eyes of Ursula Wong , a child with dark Asian eyes , caf-au-lait complexion , and a thick blond braid down her back that seems frankly too much hair for a two-and-a-half-year-old to have had time to grow . Ursula has had her second birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature , five pounds nine ounces at birth and now just over twenty-seven pounds , as of her spring checkup . She wears denim bib overalls with a purple T-shirt beneath ; in the cool of the morning she has insisted on putting on her purple hooded jacket for the weather . Snow mittens are clipped to the sleeve ends . Yes , they are purple too . It is perfect and cool in the sixties . Her mother , Annie , says , " Honey , you do n't need a coat . It 's June . " Her father , Justin , says to Annie , " She 'll figure it out pretty quick . She 'll take it off herself and think it was her own idea . " In a clearing a couple of hundred feet down an untraveled dirt track into the forest , a glade carpeted by short grass kept low by odd gravel-shot soil , Ursula is crouched on her haunches examining tiny white blooms on wild strawberry plants in the grass . Each tiny bloom is a star . Ursula is transfixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west and north from their home in Sault Sainte Marie , Michigan . They have spent the night at a Super 8 Motel in Houghton , a town that houses the state 's mining college , now more diversified as mine after mine has shut down . The motel faces Portage Lake , and Justin , who is an installer of vinyl siding and gutters , has paid the five dollars extra for a room with a view of the lake and the opposite shore . They rarely leave home , and this overnight away is a treat . Ursula has splashed in the pool and run around on the motel 's wooden deck , puddled from the day 's rain . She has giggled delightedly as with the heel of her hand she pounded buttons in the lobby vending machine to make foil packets of chocolate-chip cookies fall , klunk , to the bottom of the machine . Ursula has suggested in a business-like way that they might live here . Justin has reminded her that Grandma Mindy is back home , and her purple carpet in her bedroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said . " That 's true . " Sober as a church mouse , clear-spoken as a valedictorian . The Wongs have come here because Annie , a librarian , has gotten a bee in her bonnet of late : she wants to know more about her great-grandfather 's death in a 1926 mine collapse , and then more about his life . Seems dumb , she has said , to live so geographically close to it all and know nothing much about our roots . So the previous fall they had gone to a commemoration of the disaster at the iron mine where her great-grandfather died , and now , several months later , in weather as lovely as Eden 's , they have come to search out the site of the copper-mining camp where the family lived when her father 's grandfather was a blond barefoot boy new to Michigan , new to America . Her father is foggy about family history , does not remember being told much ; he is beer-sodden most of the time anyway . Annie has spent the previous afternoon in the archives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1926 tragedy an hour and a half south , in Rovaniemi , Michigan , while Justin and Ursula first nap and then dry-roast in the sauna until they glow . Ursula loves the sauna . She sits with a sober expression , for only a few minutes , nonetheless , and then says perkily , " I 'm done , " ready to move on to the next thing . She is after all two years old . " I 'm not , " says Justin lugubriously , peering out at her from under the wet towel draped over his head and then retreating back under . He takes sauna seriously . So Ursula sits and waits , rolling her eyes in the way she has seen little Olivia do on old Cosby Show reruns , precocious , in charge but obedient . Ursula 's swimsuit is purple , like her bedroom carpet and her coat and everything else in which she has a say , and she sits on the hot cedar bench on a small purple towel . She draws the line at the television dinosaur called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when anyone mentions him , with an exaggerated wave of her tiny hands , dismissive , parodying someone else  --  maybe from Brooklyn  --  she 's seen on TV . Ursula 's even having come to be  --  considering Annie 's injuries ( a fractured pelvis from a hit-and-run accident at age ten which also broke both her legs ) and all the doctors ' attendant warnings  --  is a miracle in everyone 's eyes . It has occurred to Annie that the birth of any of us , our coming to birth at all , in light of all the hazards every ancestor faced , is pretty much a miracle too , and she has been chewing on this thought for several months . While Justin and Annie are awed and protective toward Ursula , they also believe that she needs to learn to make choices from early on . So she gets to make choices . She is , as a result , a bright , perky child , astonishing everyone . That evening , taking Ursula for a final packet of cookies , Justin hears the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down between a tool salesmen from Ironwood and a grandfather from Escanaba who is en route to see his little granddaughter Ursula 's age , in Bay Mills , and has stopped here to visit the shrine of a sainted priest-missionary for his wife , who has cancer . They are all watching the Stanley Cup playoffs . There is a television in the Wongs ' room upstairs , of course , but the lure of the lobby and all of these hockey fans is irresistible to Justin . He drops into a chair and starts roaring with the rest of the men . Out through the glass door of the lobby , in the twilight , the surface of the lake sparkles . Ursula stands waving her silver packet of cookies with a defeated look but also with flashes of a tiny anger . She makes an exasperated face at the desk attendant , as if to say , Men . The attendant laughs heartily . The New Jersey Devils are playing the Anaheim Ducks , and the Devils are on their way to shutting out the Ducks . Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , playing against each other , are actually related , at not so great a distance back in time , to his wife , Annie , who is here after all seeking out her ancestry , and neither he nor Annie will ever know it . On the Devils , Oleg Tverdovsky , from Donetsk , in Ukraine , is descended from an ancestor who migrated east ; on the Ducks , Fredrik Olausson , of Ddesj , Sweden , has hands shaped like those of Annie 's great-grandfather dead in the mine , passed down from a shared great-grandfather of their own . The degrees of separation are considerable  --  the connections go back to the beginning of the nineteenth century  --  and no one is asking the question , anyway . Justin 's high-school team in Sault Sainte Marie was called the Blue Devils , and he is rooting for the Devils . The lady at the desk has a name tag that says eileen . She looks down at Ursula standing rolling her eyes , waving her packet of Mrs. Fields cookies , waiting for Justin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asks . " Well , who 's playing ? " says Ursula perkily , her eyebrows lifted . The attendant is surprised at the response . What did she expect ? " The Devils and the Ducks , " says Eileen . " I like ducks , " says Ursula . " I hate devils . Devils are ba-a-ad . " The attendant laughs heartily . " They 're not real devils , " she says . " I do n't care , " Ursula says . " I like ducks . " Justin and the tool salesman and the grandfather hear none of this . There is a great deal of roaring from the onscreen crowd as well . Pucks fly , ice shivers up in fine flurries , blood flows . All is adrenaline joy . The attendant helps Ursula open the cookies and gets her some milk from the breakfast room , checking with Justin first in pantomime . Justin nods yes , but this is after all hockey he 's watching : she might have asked him anything and he 'd agree . The Devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using her cane , looking for them . She and Ursula and Eileen have a good laugh at the hockey fans . " She likes ducks , " Eileen says to Annie , reporting the remark . " But she does n't like devils . " Eileen crouches to Ursula 's eye height and high-fives her . " Gal after my own heart , " she says , slapping palms . They are driving today to the site of a settlement where Annie 's great-grandfather had lived in his childhood , soon after he came over from Finland , the now overgrown location of an abandoned copper-mining community out toward the point . On their way north from Houghton this morning they have stopped in Calumet to take a couple of pictures of Ursula sitting on the lap of the oversized statue of Alexander Agassiz , Harvard naturalist , copper baron , and aristocrat , otherness incarnate and no friend to the hoi polloi . Still , his sculpted bronze robes are cool , and Ursula poses sitting on his knee as if he were a dear , loving uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glade looked inviting , and time is abundant  --  and to spend the rest of the day seeking out where the camp would have been . Camp Grit . Its name must surely have been a joke , Annie thinks  --  or maybe not ? Nature has taken over again at the site of the camp , perseverant , triumphing over all humans ' intents . The land had been leveled , entirely , but , the historian at the college has told Annie , the forest has reasserted itself and is as thick as if it were first growth . The cabins will be gone , even the traces of their foundations , he says , as well as all traces of the two churches that came later on , whose bells were transported inland for two other churches , both Lutheran , one Finnish , one Norwegian . Finns and Norwegians did not worship together , even if both were Lutherans . Perhaps , Annie thinks , all traces of human habitation will be gone , but still she wants to see where her great-grandfather lived as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know it directly . Justin is less curious about his own heritage . Annie 's father , Garrett Maki , spends most of his days and nights drunk since her mother 's death , eighteen years before , while Annie was in the hospital recovering from the crash that crippled her . Garrett is on disability now , as a Vietnam veteran , but no one is certain just what his disability is . Annie suspects  --  no , believes  --  that her father was responsible for her mother 's death : there had been a great deal of abuse , and Liz Maki died of a head injury the night of an outburst on Garrett 's part . There were no witnesses , there were no charges . Domestic violence was not a thing people were comfortable talking about then . The eighties are as distant as the glaciers . Annie walks with difficulty , always with that cane , and invariably wears long skirts to cover her scars and her atrophied muscles . Justin is able-bodied and hearty , half Chinese . He is known to local hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely in love . Because Ursula is clamoring for lunch , they have pulled the truck over onto a graveled apron of the road , then meandered through a patch of woods , and are wandering peacefully in an odd clearing a short distance into the woods . They have no idea that this clearing once held the boiler house of an old mine . The grass grows up through a layer of finest ashy pea-gravel , a relic of the long-vanished brick structure . When the mine was operating , the land was scalped clean : no trees anywhere . The forest is thick again . The fragrance of lilacs hovers in the air : there are wild lilac bushes to either side of the clearing . Lupines with their intense tiny indigo blooms poke up here and there . Clumps of wild lavender tuck themselves everywhere . Something else  --  a bush ?  --  smells like licorice . Justin has set down the picnic basket in the grass . A tiny brown-speckled bird lands on its arched handle . Ursula chortles in delight and leaps to grab it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fly . " The bird , as if to demonstrate , lifts off . Ursula claps her hands in delight . Then she crouches again and tries to pick one of the tiny white blossoms . " Let it be , " Annie says . " It will make a strawberry . " Ursula rises to standing , her full height of two feet plus , plunks her fists onto her hips , elbows akimbo , and scowls in frustration : Here we are out in all this great sweet stuff and I ca n't do anything . At the edge of the denser forest at the back of the clearing , there is a rustling sound . Papery , slight , but distinct in the silence . Ursula 's head turns . A flash of white : a deer , venturing tentatively out of the forest , has spotted them , and turns tail to run . It is perhaps a dozen feet away . Ursula runs after it , squealing . The deer , of course , will not be caught , and there is nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile at each other , a moment too quick in its passing to run to the truck for the camera . Ursula tiptoes dramatically , thinking perhaps of Olivia again  --  she watches those Cosby Show reruns , mesmerized , over and over night after night and can recite people 's lines along with them . She cranes back over her shoulder at Justin and Annie to make sure they see her . They beam at her . She puts her finger to her lips : Shhh . Her back is to them . The blond braid down her back shines like silk floss in the sunlight , against the plum violet quilt of the coat . The deer is still in sight , a few feet into the leafy green shade of the forest . She is determined to catch it . The delight in her eyes is unmistakable . She gives them a sign in mime : Watch me . Ursula 's every gesture seems meant for the comedic stage . She is a natural . She tiptoes toward the tree line . The deer disappears deeper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burst of speed , silent herself , looking back at Justin and Annie , steps into the trees , and disappears from sight . The only sound is an astonished tiny intake of breath from Ursula as she goes down , like a penny into the slot of a bank , disappeared , gone . Annie looks terror at Justin , trips on the long skirt that covers her scars , lurches forward , and falls awkwardly onto her bare elbows . They sting and ooze blood . Justin is already at the spot where Ursula disappeared . " Oh , God , Annie , " he says . His voice is barely audible . Annie raises herself on her cane and stumbles toward him . They stand transfixed , staring down . The opening into which Ursula has fallen is amazingly small , and they can see nothing but darkness . They certainly can not see Ursula herself . Neither of them wants to call out to her , unconsciously afraid their voices will echo back at them from too deep an emptiness . Both of them think : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . Both of them think : A mine shaft ? Neither says the word . Annie had tried to imagine the shaft into which her grandfather descended one August day three-quarters of a century ago and from which he did not come out alive : fifteen hundred feet deep . No one could survive such a fall . . . but is this such a shaft ? Annie is telling herself , no , it must be something else . Too small for a mine shaft , surely . Way too small . Then it must be a well . She heaves a half-sigh of imaginary relief . But what would a well be doing out here in the forest ? The answer would be : The same thing as a mine shaft , serving a different landscape , a different time . And why in the name of anything would a well seem a relief ? Her breath clutches up again . Rough old timbers are laid across an opening in the ground six or seven or eight feet square . It is too early in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year it has grown up and died off , and grown up and died off , so the timbers remain exposed . One of those years , perhaps forty years ago when Justin and Annie 's parents were in high school  --  and no one much has been here since , wandering into this forest which is after all nowhere  --  a tiny shoot grew up between the first and second timbers . As it grew , it pushed them apart , and it has become a tall solid tree , growing from inside the hole , through the timbers set into a collar to seal this shaft . As it happens , this is indeed a mine shaft , an air shaft , meant only for ventilation of the long since abandoned passages below . Annie kneels painfully , all her weight on her cane , and calls into the darkness : Ursula . She ca n't tell anything about the depth of the hole . She calls again : Ursula , and then she sobs . She looks up at Justin . It has been a providence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , or they might fall into blaming themselves or each other in their grief . Neither even considers that . Justin 's eyes dart wildly but his mind is clear . " How far would you say it was since we saw civilization ? " he says . " Thirty miles ? " He stops . " Three miles ? " It could be either . " The cell ! " Annie says . " In the truck ? " Justin runs to the truck , his work boots seeming to shake the ground . The cell phone lies on the front seat , tiny and useless amid a scattering of animal crackers . In crisis the mind focuses on minutiae : he thinks , Now is that cookie a rhinoceros or a hippopotamus ? He picks up the phone . No signal . Of course , no signal : there are no towers out here in the wilderness . He tries to remember how many cars they saw on the road . All he can remember is the fat , furry rear end of a black bear cub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie trying to take a snapshot . He follows that rabbit trail into his mind and recalls the bright topaz eyes of what must have been a cougar just off the road as they drove up in the dark in the rain , the night before . But of course a car coming along the road now , Justin thinks , would be no help at all : none of their phones work either . A rusty dark red Subaru zooms by , heading north . The road is once again empty and silent , the sunlight bright and impassive . Justin remembers a time as a teenager when his first car , a beater the color of pea soup , had stopped dead just west of Sault Sainte Marie at twilight . A passing car had offered to send help , then did n't . He recalls walking alongside the road in the dark , kicking stones , mumbling " goddamn fucker " again and again . Ca n't chance that kind of thing now . Trust no one . Justin has not trusted many folks in his life anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned the family when he was three , not much older than Ursula is now . Justin calculates the distance back to the last town they passed , Eagle River , and then estimates mileage forward to Eagle Harbor , next on the map . Forward seems best . He runs back to Annie . She sits silent on the ground , her legs out painfully straight before her , her eyes filled with tears . Justin 's attention is drawn to the pattern of the fabric of her skirt : a pattern of tiny blueberries and green leaves . His mind is recording that to keep from attending to what has just happened . Blueberries , he thinks . I never noticed that those were blueberries . The silence from the gap between the timbers is deafening , the darkness there impenetrable and magnetic as a black hole . They can see only a few inches into the opening : the leaf cover overhead is thick and the shade almost palpable . In the silence , the birds ' twittering seems obscene , out of place . Annie seems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to register . Justin , however , is functioning in hockey mode : alert , aggressive , all nerve ends ready . " No phone , " he says to Annie . " No towers . " He sees the look of dismay in her eyes : lost , disbelieving . " I 'm going to drive on to Eagle Harbor , " he says . " I 'll get help . " He feels as if he will throw up his innards . " You can do this . Ursula will be okay . " He sounds calmer than he feels . Annie just stares at him as if dumbfounded by his composure . " Look , " he says , half-angrily . " Was she a miracle or what ? So would God just let her go this way ? " Annie ca n't believe he 's talking this way . He ca n't stand for her to mention anything in the vicinity of God , shuts her down when she tries . All of a sudden he 's preaching ? And of course Ursula is in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment . We 're on an old Candid Camera show . No , America 's Funniest Home Videos , that 's it . " Okay , " Annie says , her voice belying her pounding heart . " Go then . I 'll wait . " She tries to think of something important to say about logistics , what he must not forget to do , but she can think of nothing at all . So she just repeats herself . " I 'll wait . " The tone is as if she were waiting her turn at the butcher 's or the photo counter at Wal-Mart . " Yeah , right , " Justin says , his eyes wide with terror . He leans and kisses Annie on the top of her head . Her hair is warm . The pale skin of her part looks so vulnerable . He focuses on anything but that hole in the ground . " We 'll get our miracle , " he says . " Hurry , " she says , the audible quavering of her own voice this time scaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , the truck spraying up gravel . It will be seven hours from now  --  Monday night  --  a news team on the TV will be helicoptered up from Marquette to broadcast nationally what is not this morning known to anyone else , what has not quite even registered in Annie 's consciousness  --  before the remark is made . A woman her parents ' age back in Sault Sainte Marie will be lounging alone in the newly remodeled high-ceilinged living room of the home she inherited from her parents , passed down from her grandfather the judge . Fried and sour after two gins , she will grumble at the TV screen , " Why are they wasting all that money and energy on a goddamn half-breed trailer-trash kid ? " Annie 's mind is pulling up , as from a well , the tacit answer to that as yet unasked question . Annie can not think of Ursula down that hole , so she thinks : So many generations , back into history and then prehistory , all concentrated into this one little girl . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format : this little girl carries with her the inheritance of generations uncounted , precious , induplicable . She is priceless , not only to Annie and Justin , but to the planet , the whole big fat blue-green ball hurtling through space . As Annie 's mind drops as far as it can conceive , down the dark hole of her own lack of knowledge about her own and Justin 's families ' past , an unfocused image of someone Chinese  --  male or female she can not see , an older person , to judge from the posture and shuffling step ; likely a male now , to judge from the shoulders and slight baldness , wearing a green gown  --  flits past her consciousness like a resurfacing memory of something she never knew to begin with . She can not flesh it out into focus so instead she begins trying to name the trees that surround her , to keep her mind off that hole and its darkness , and she can not remember the names of the trees either . Her eyes fill with tears and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deafening . Justin heads north on the winding road , taking the curves too fast , hearing himself saying out loud to the empty cab , " Christ , " again and again , and then " Crap , " and then " Christ , " and then silence .
