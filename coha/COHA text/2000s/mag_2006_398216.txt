What apes can teach us about the human mind <p> At the opening of Stanley Kubrick 's 1968 film 2001 : A Space Odyssey , a group of apes hovers around an object that has suddenly appeared in the desert . The sleek , black , rectangular object is five times as tall as the apes and clearly crafted by intelligent beings . The apes approach it with caution , and one animal runs a timid hand along the clean edges that glimmer in the sunlight . <p> Suddenly , something clicks in the ape 's mind . The sight of a sophisticated innovation has launched dormant aptitudes , and the ape has realized that a large bone can be used as a weapon to advance its kind . Standing more erect than before and brandishing the weapon , the ape attacks another group . <p> The film then fast-forwards through the remainder of cognitive evolution in a flash : The bone , tossed into the air , becomes a space station floating through the cosmos . <p> Too bad the camera did n't cut instead to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where scientists are discovering details about apes ' brains that could fill in some of the movie 's multimillion-year gap . Researchers at the institute , Josep Call and Nicholas Mulcahy , recently demonstrated that apes possess a surprising understanding of tools and even make plans to use them . In fact , the study suggests that planning skills go back 14 million years to ancestors of apes and people . <p> Two other knacks once considered unique to humans have recently turned up in apes . A team of scientists watching apes at the Yerkes Primate Center at Emory University in Atlanta reports that the animals conform to cultural norms-that is , they do a task the same way that others in a group do it , even if an alternative method exists . <p> Another team studying apes raised at the Language Research Center at Georgia State University , also in Atlanta , concludes that young animals play make-believe , an activity considered an early sign of linguistic abilities . <p> These studies represent an effort to understand some of the human mind 's fundamental mechanisms . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities , " I do n't think there 's a difference in kind , " says Call . <p> Investigating these differences could reveal " the processes that led to our position , " says Carel van Schaik , director of the Anthropological Institute and Museum at the University of Zurich in Switzerland . " We can build a bridge across the ape-human gap without denying that there are some really big differences . " <p> PLANNING OF THE APES For Call and Mulcahy , the most fitting metaphor for ape cognition is n't A Space Odyssey but an Estonian folktale . In that story , a young girl dreams of attending a party where she ca n't eat dessert because she has no spoon . The next night , the girl takes a spoon to bed , in case the dream recurs . <p> The scientists placed bonobos and orangutans in a similar scenario . Previous studies had clearly shown that apes use tools to satisfy an immediate need . In the wild , for example , they frequently transport rocks to smash open nuts . But the researchers wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would n't need until much later . <p> Before the test , the apes had learned how to retrieve a bunch of grapes locked inside a container . The apes had to insert a thin plastic pipe into a slot , as though the pipe were a key . In the test , Call and Mulcahy led the apes , one at a time , into a test room where each animal saw the grape-holding container and four objects : a dowel , a plastic dish , a bowl , and the slot-fitting pipe . <p> Here , the experiment went beyond observations of tool use . A Plexiglas panel blocked the container , so the ape could n't retrieve the grapes , even with the right tool . Each animal was free to take away an object when it left the room and was n't permitted to return for an hour . <p> By then , the researchers had removed the Plexiglas and all the tools . An ape that had selected the right tool , removed it from the test room , and brought it back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , the successful animals planned ahead . <p> The test was performed 16 times for each of three bonobos and three orangutans . On average , each ape solved the task 7 times , with one ape solving it 15 times and another only twice . The animals improved slightly as they repeated the test . <p> The best-performing bonobo and orangutan were brought back for a more difficult test . In 16 additional trials , each of these two apes visited the test room and then was kept out of it overnight , yet about half the time they carried the appropriate tool into the room the next morning . <p> But , the most impressive display of sophisticated thinking , Mulcahy says , came from an unexpected incident . An orangutan brought back the wrong tool and then shaped it into a usable key . <p> To learn whether the apes were carrying the tools simply by force of habit or because they enjoyed doing so , Call and Mulcahy performed another test , in which they repeatedly removed the grapes after a first showing behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no reason to haul the tool around-after all , why bring a spoon to a party without desserts ? <p> Sure enough , two of the apes in this trial never brought along the pipe . The two other animals in this trial seldom did so , the researchers reported in the May 19 Science . <p> Mulcahy argues that the animals ' delayed success depends on them making a realization similar to that of the girl in the folktale , who had to fail-at least in her dream-before she could plan ahead . <p> Since bonobos and orangutans both solved the tasks , Call and Mulcahy concluded that the cognitive seeds for planning were already in place at least 14 million years ago , when a common ancestor to these apes and humans lived . <p> Van Schaik comments that he frequently sees evidence of planning from apes in the wild . For example , orangutans often give " long calls " to let others know the direction in which they 're going to travel a couple hours later , he says . While this action is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that apes might at least plan their afternoons . <p> But some other researchers are skeptical of the new data . Clutching a tool to get grapes does n't demonstrate planning , says Daniel Povinelli , who is director of the Cognitive Evolution Group at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette . <p> The apes were n't necessarily thinking about the task ahead when they selected the pipe . They had been trained to use it but had no experience with the other tools , which " might as well be books of Shakespeare , " Povinelli says . <p> Moreover , the apes might have learned to associate having the pipe with success in getting the grapes , which is a simpler mental function than planning . Povinelli points out that most of the apes did n't consistently bring back the pipe until halfway through the experiment , which is what he 'd expect for the association explanation . " The fact they carry the tool is n't evidence to their conception of the future , " he says . <p> Despite Povinelli 's criticism , a commentary accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landmark . Call and Mulcahy demonstrate " the most extensive foresight yet in nonhuman primates , " writes cognitive psychologist Thomas Suddendorf of the University of the University of Queensland in Australia . " This provides a starting point from which we can begin to reconstruct the evolution of the human mind , " he says . <p> SWAMP SMARTS Other recent experiments also suggest humanlike cognition in apes . Last year , researchers working at Emory found evidence that animals conform to cultural influences in the same way that people do ( SN : 9/3/05 , p. 158 ) . Such cultural conformity , for example , motivates a person to bow in greeting in Japan but to shake hands in the United States . <p> In the study , two groups of apes learned to operate a device that releases food when a trigger is either lifted or poked . In each group , subordinate apes predominantly got the food in the same way-a lift or a poke-that their group leader did . Because they occasionally pulled instead of poked , or vice versa , the animals had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apes were retested 2 months later , they still overwhelmingly used their leader 's method , the team reported in the Sept. 29 , 2005 Nature . <p> " To find that some aspects of culture , however rudimentary , can be found in other animals , " says study coauthor Frans de Waal , " means our ancestors-maybe even our animal ancestors-had cultural traditions . We know that these cultural traditions were essential to their survival . " <p> But the evolutionary importance of culture might go beyond survival , says van Schaik . He thinks that culture , as a mechanism for transmitting knowledge , played a critical role in hominid cognitive advancement . In fact , cultural interaction in early humans might have catalyzed the heightened intelligence that we possess today , he argues in the April Scientific American . <p> Van Schaik came to this conclusion after observing a group of wild orangutans in the hot , insect-ridden swamps of Sumatra . Although most orangutans do n't use tools in the wild , he says , he found a population of orangutans that fashioned sticks to penetrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , other groups of orangutans that lived nearby risked injury by opening the prickly fruit with their hands or avoided it . <p> The stick-using orangutans also showed other innovative behaviors that the other groups lacked , and this population was the only one in which adults foraged together . <p> Van Schaik theorizes that the apes ' frequent interactions enabled less-skilled adults to learn an innovative behavior and teach it to their children . Over time , such cultural dissemination advances the overall intelligence of the population , he asserts . <p> " There seems to be a link between culture and intelligence , in that animals that are more culturally advanced , or have broader cultural repertoires , actually turn out to be smarter , " van Schaik says . " That 's not terribly surprising if you talk about people , but you do n't expect it to be true for nonpeople . " <p> THUS SPAKE PANPANZEE As innovations grew in complexity , the primitive communication techniques used by early apes could have likewise grown . " People speculate why we have language , " de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitates the transmission of a lot of knowledge . " <p> A new study tackles the evolutionary roots of language by observing the playful behavior of young apes . In people , both language and pretending are considered outgrowths of a general symbolic function , says Patricia Greenfield of the University of California , Los Angeles . If apes develop pretending behavior by advancing through the same stages that children do , Greenfield and her colleagues say , then some shared ancestor probably possessed this general symbolic function . <p> Human children demonstrate five stages of pretending , the highest being the treatment of toys as animate objects , which shows up after age 2 . To study whether apes follow the same path , the researchers analyzed playful interactions between five apes-three bonobos and two chimpanzees-and their caregivers . Most interactions took place when the apes were 2 to 5 years old . <p> The young apes indeed progressed through the stages of pretend play in the same way that human children do , the researchers report in the July-September Cognitive Development . <p> The most impressive example of pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , pretended to groom a doll , says study leader Heidi Lyn of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland . Panpanzee then pretended to pluck bugs off her body and feed them to the doll , offering some bugs to the caregiver , Liz , as well . Liz offered some imaginary bugs back to Panpanzee , who pretended to eat them . <p> Because people , bonobos , and chimpanzees had a common ancestor 5 million years ago , symbolic function-and thus the developmental roots of language-extends back at least this far , the authors conclude . <p> In the study , the young apes often began pretending on their own and were boosted to a higher level by the responses of their caregivers . The researchers call this process scaffolding . The beginnings of a cognitive skill , such as pretending or using language , might exist without being used for that purpose , but scaffolding puts the mental wheels in motion , Greenfield says . <p> In a particular environment , the seeds of cognition can mature , she proposes . So , while apes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so in settings where they are trained to communicate through a device called a Lexigram . <p> Pretend play and Lexigram use may be evidence of a generalized symbolic function out of which language could have grown in the subsequent millions of years , Greenfield says . <p> Povinelli is more cautious . He worries that when researchers focus on traits shared by ape and human ancestors , they ignore differences between the species that could reveal as much or more about ape and human cognition . <p> " The danger is that we use our folk psychology to reconstruct the minds of apes according to our own models of human beings , " Povinelli says . " We never get at what it 's really like to be an ape , and we never fully appreciate what it means to be human . " <p> Without a vast study of many animal species , it 's difficult to suggest that any given quality in people emerged from an ancestor shared with apes , says Simon Reader of Utrecht University in the Netherlands , who studies innovative behavior in animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a behavior in common with humans , you still do n't know if the behavior is found across primates or the animal kingdom in general , " says Reader . <p> Povinelli would like to see researchers demonstrate that apes consider abstract notions , such as the fundamental difference between colors and shapes . Such experiments have been tried , unsuccessfully , in monkeys , he notes . Discovering the true limits of ape intelligence will show more about humanity , says Povinelli . <p> " We know that apes can learn to use tools properly , " he says . " We 've known that for 100 years . " The real question is whether ape behavior is the result of abstract considerations-perhaps about the future , the past , or love-or simply a reaction to a situation . <p> " Yes , they 're thinking , " says Povinelli . " But what are they thinking about ? " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : GREAT GRAPE  --  An ape carries pipes that it can use to retrieve grapes locked in a container .
