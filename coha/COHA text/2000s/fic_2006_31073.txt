The Husband By Dean Koontz Random House Dean Koontz 1 A man begins dying at the moment of his birth . Most people live in denial of Death 's patient courtship until , late in life and deep in sickness , they become aware of him sitting bedside . Eventually , Mitchell Rafferty would be able to cite the minute that he began to recognize the inevitability of his death : Monday , May 14 , 11:43 in the morning -- three weeks short of his twenty-eighth birthday . Until then , he had rarely thought of dying . A born optimist , charmed by nature 's beauty and amused by humanity , he had no cause or inclination to wonder when and how his mortality would be proven . When the call came , he was on his knees . Thirty flats of red and purple impatiens remained to be planted . The flowers produced no fragrance , but the fertile smell of the soil pleased him . His clients , these particular homeowners , liked saturated colors : red , purple , deep yellow , hot pink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood them . Raised poor , they had built a successful business by working hard and taking risks . To them , life was intense , and saturated colors reflected the truth of nature 's vehemence . This apparently ordinary but in fact momentous morning , the California sun was a buttery ball . The sky had a basted sheen . Pleasantly warm , not searing , the daynevertheless left a greasy sweat on Ignatius Barnes . His brow glistened . His chin dripped . At work in the same bed of flowers , ten feet from Mitch , Iggy looked boiled . From May until July , his skin responded to the sun not with melanin but with a fierce blush . For one-sixth of the year , before he finally tanned , he appeared to be perpetually embarrassed . Iggy did not possess an understanding of symmetry and harmony in landscape design , and he could n't be trusted to trim roses properly . He was a hard worker , however , and good if not intellectually bracing company . " You hear what happened to Ralph Gandhi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mickey 's brother . " " Mickey Gandhi ? I do n't know him , either . " " Sure you do , " Iggy said . " Mickey , he hangs out sometimes at Rolling Thunder . " Rolling Thunder was a surfers ' bar . " I have n't been there in years , " Mitch said . " Years ? Are you serious ? " " Entirely . " " I thought you still dropped in sometimes . " " So I 've really been missed , huh ? " " I 'll admit , nobody 's named a bar stool after you . What -- did you find someplace better than Rolling Thunder ? " " Remember coming to my wedding three years ago ? " Mitch asked . " Sure . You had great seafood tacos , but the band was woofy . " " They were n't woofy . " " Man , they had tambourines . " " We were on a budget . At least they did n't have an accordion . " " Because playing an accordion exceeded their skill level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They did n't have finger bells , either . " Wiping his brow with one forearm , Iggy complained : " I must have Eskimo genes . I break a sweat at fifty degrees . " Mitch said , " I do n't do bars anymore . I do marriage . " " Yeah , but ca n't you do marriage and Rolling Thunder ? " " I 'd just rather be home than anywhere else . " " Oh , boss , that 's sad , " said Iggy . " It 's not sad . It 's the best . " " If you put a lion in a zoo three years , six years , he never forgets what freedom was like . " Planting purple impatiens , Mitch said , " How would you know ? You ever asked a lion ? " " I do n't have to ask one . I am a lion . " " You 're a hopeless boardhead . " " And proud of it . I 'm glad you found Holly . She 's a great lady . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Iggy . And what do you do with it ? " " Do with what ? " " Your freedom . What do you do with your freedom ? " " Anything I want . " " Like , for example ? " " Anything . Like , if I want sausage pizza for dinner , I do n't have to ask anyone what she wants . " " Radical . " " If I want to go to Rolling Thunder for a few beers , there 's nobody to bitch at me . " " Holly does n't bitch . " " I can get beer-slammed every night if I want , and nobody 's gon na be calling to ask when am I coming home . " Mitch began to whistle " Born Free . " " Some wahine comes on to me , " Iggy said , " I 'm free to rock and roll . " " They 're coming on to you all the time -- are they ?  - -  those sexy wahines ? " " Women are bold these days , boss . They see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Iggy , the last time you got laid , John Kerry thought he was going to be president . " " That 's not so long ago . " " So what happened to Ralph ? " " Ralph who ? " " Mickey Gandhi 's brother . " " Oh , yeah . An iguana bit off his nose . " " Nasty . " " Some fully macking ten-footers were breaking , so Ralph and some guys went night-riding at the Wedge . " The Wedge was a famous surfing spot at the end of the Balboa Peninsula , in Newport Beach . Iggy said , " They packed coolers full of submarine sandwiches and beer , and one of them brought Ming . " " Ming ? " " That 's the iguana . " " So it was a pet ? " " Ming , he 'd always been sweet before . " " I 'd expect iguanas to be moody . " " No , they 're affectionate . What happened was some wanker , not even a surfer , just a wannabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of salami . " " Reptiles on speed , " Mitch said , " is a bad idea . " " Meth Ming was a whole different animal from clean-and-sober Ming , " Iggy confirmed . Putting down his trowel , sitting back on the heels of his work shoes , Mitch said , " So now Ralph Gandhi is noseless ? " " Ming did n't eat the nose . He just bit it off and spit it out . " " Maybe he did n't like Indian food . " " They had a big cooler full of ice water and beer . They put the nose in the cooler and rushed it to the hospital . " " Did they take Ralph , too ? " " They had to take Ralph . It was his nose . " " Well , " Mitch said , " we are talking about boardheads . " " They said it was kinda blue when they fished it out of the ice water , but a plastic surgeon sewed it back on , and now it 's not blue anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He crashed . He was totally amped-out for a day . Now he 's his old self . " " That 's good . It 's probably hard to find a clinic that 'll do iguana rehab . " Mitch got to his feet and retrieved three dozen empty plastic plant pots . He carried them to his extended-bed pickup . The truck stood at the curb , in the shade of an Indian laurel . Although the neighborhood had been built-out only five years earlier , the big tree had already lifted the sidewalk . Eventually the insistent roots would block lawn drains and invade the sewer system . The developer 's decision to save one hundred dollars by not installing a root barrier would produce tens of thousands in repair work for plumbers , landscapers , and concrete contractors . When Mitch planted an Indian laurel , he always used a root barrier . He did n't need to make future work for himself . Green growing Nature would keep him busy . The street lay silent , without traffic . Not the barest breath of a breeze stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther side of the street , a man and a dog approached . The dog , a retriever , spent less time walking than it did sniffing messages left by others of its kind . The stillness pooled so deep that Mitch almost believed he could hear the panting of the distant canine . Golden : the sun and the dog , the air and the promise of the day , the beautiful houses behind deep lawns . Mitch Rafferty could not afford a home in this neighborhood . He was satisfied just to be able to work here . You could love great art but have no desire to live in a museum . He noticed a damaged sprinkler head where lawn met sidewalk . He got his tools from the truck and knelt on the grass , taking a break from the impatiens . His cell phone rang . He unclipped it from his belt , flipped it open . The time was displayed -- 11:43 -- but no caller 's number showed on the screen . He took the call anyway . " Big Green , " he said , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , though he no longer remembered why . " Mitch , I love you , " Holly said . " Hey , sweetie . " " Whatever happens , I love you . " She cried out in pain . A clatter and crash suggested a struggle . Alarmed , Mitch rose to his feet . " Holly ? " Some guy said something , some guy who now had the phone . Mitch did n't hear the words because he was focused on the background noise . Holly squealed . He 'd never heard such a sound from her , such fear . " Sonofabitch , " she said , and was silenced by a sharp crack , as though she 'd been slapped . The stranger on the phone said , " You hear me , Rafferty ? " " Holly ? Where 's Holly ? " Now the guy was talking away from the phone , not to Mitch : " Do n't be stupid . Stay on the floor . " Another man spoke in the background , his words unclear . The one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want to lose some teeth , honey ? " She was with two men . One of them had hit her . Hit her . Mitch could n't get his mind around the situation . Reality suddenly seemed as slippery as the narrative of a nightmare . A meth-crazed iguana was more real than this . Near the house , Iggy planted impatiens . Sweating , red from the sun , as solid as ever . " That 's better , honey . That 's a good girl . " Mitch could n't draw breath . A great weight pressed on his lungs . He tried to speak but could n't find his voice , did n't know what to say . Here in bright sun , he felt casketed , buried alive . " We have your wife , " said the guy on the phone . Mitch heard himself ask , " Why ? " " Why do you think , asshole ? " Mitch did n't know why . He did n't want to know . He did n't want to reason through to an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm planting flowers . " " What 's wrong with you , Rafferty ? " " That 's what I do . Plant flowers . Repair sprinklers . " " Are you buzzed or something ? " " I 'm just a gardener . " " So we have your wife . You get her back for two million cash . " Mitch knew it was n't a joke . If it were a joke , Holly would have to be in on it , but her sense of humor was not cruel . " You 've made a mistake . " " You hear what I said ? Two million . " " Man , you are n't listening . I 'm a gardener . " " We know . " " I have like eleven thousand bucks in the bank . " " We know . " Brimming with fear and confusion , Mitch had no room for anger . Compelled to clarify , perhaps more for himself than for the caller , he said , " I just run a little two-man operation . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be in touch about the details . " Mitch was sweating . " This is nuts . Where would I get two million bucks ? " " You 'll find a way . " The stranger 's voice was hard , implacable . In a movie , Death might sound like this . " It is n't possible , " Mitch said . " You want to hear her scream again ? " " No . Do n't . " " Do you love her ? " " Yes . " " Really love her ? " " She 's everything to me . " How peculiar , that he should be sweating yet feel so cold . " If she 's everything to you , " said the stranger , " then you 'll find a way . " " There is n't a way . " " If you go to the cops , we 'll cut her fingers off one by one , and cauterize them as we go . We 'll cut her tongue out . And her eyes . Then we 'll leave her alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The stranger spoke without menace , in a matter-of-fact tone , as if he were not making a threat but were instead merely explaining the details of his business model . Mitchell Rafferty had no experience of such men . He might as well have been talking to a visitor from the far end of the galaxy . He could not speak because suddenly it seemed that he might so easily , unwittingly say the wrong thing and ensure Holly 's death sooner rather than later . The kidnapper said , " Just so you 'll know we 're serious . . . " After a silence , Mitch asked , " What ? " " See that guy across the street ? " Mitch turned and saw a single pedestrian , the man walking the slow dog . They had progressed half a block . The sunny day had a porcelain glaze . Rifle fire shattered the stillness , and the dogwalker went down , shot in the head . " Midnight Wednesday , " said the man on the phone . " We 're damn serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
