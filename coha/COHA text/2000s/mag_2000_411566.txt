Working exclusively in Norfolk Island pine , he has created an oeuvre of surprising variation and complexity . Photograph // IN TODAY 'S RAPIDLY EVOLVING FIELD OF WOOD TURNING , THE CONSTANCY OF RON KENT IS SOMETHING OF AN anomaly . His work is as popular and as respected as any in the business . Kent 's turnings are in the collections of major museums and various heads of state ; he even hasa piece atthe Vatican.Yet in many ways , Kent is an amateur at heart . A retired stockbroker , who lives in Hawaii , he did not have to earn a living from his craft when he started out . And although he now makes turned vessels full time , he still works mainly to please himself . While many professional turners move quickly from material to material and form to form , Kent 's explorations are marked by steady intensity . He works entirely in one type of wood and makes only three shapes-open straight-walled bowls , bowls with everted lips , and standing cups . But within these relatively narrow confines , Kent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity . In large part this is due to the many advantages ofthe wood he uses , a Hawaiian species called Norfolk Island pine . The most obvious attraction of this wood is that it is somewhat translucent , a property common to softwoods . Kent augments the wood 's natural ability to transmit light by applying over 20 coats of oil to the surface of the vessel after it is turned on the lathe . Why 20 ? Because the oil dulls as it gets absorbed into the porous wall of the piece . But when the application is repeated , Kent discovered , the oil penetrates the fibers of the wood and polymerizes into a hard gel inside the vessel wall . As a result , the bowls take on a dramatic , fiery color if placed under strong lighting . Looking closely at one of Kent 's translucent vessels feels a bit like having X-ray vision , because features inside the wood are exposed to the eye . Milky swirls of resin , variations in figure and small knots of grain all create a subtle pattern within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect complement to the pine 's translucency . Many woods , if left exposed to humidity , develop dark streaks called spalting . In the case of Norfolk pine , exposed to the wet air of Hawaii , spalting begins after only two orthree weeks on the woodpile . The same effect is often seen in hardwoods such as maple , as a lattice of thin , black lines . In either case , the coloration is caused by a fungus that infiltrates the wood after it has been cut . Heavily spalted timber may become so weak as to be unusable for lathe turning , but if controlled property , the fungus can spread across much of the figure of the wood without compromising the strength of the log . The result is a flow of inky veils that seem to drip down the vessel walls . In Kent 's work , the playof these opaque black patches of spalting against the translucent golden wood is nothing short of breathtaking . Photograph // Clearly , Kent 's vessels are expressly intended for display , preferably on a pedestal under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unlike most wood turnings , their satisfactions are more visual than tactile . Their sensational luminosity under display lighting bears a close resemblance to the theatrical effects achieved by some studio glass . The appeal in both cases is that of a material utterly transmuted . Not coincidentally , Kent is one ofa small handful of wood turners whose work is shown by galleries that focus on contemporary glass . He also emulates the blowing of molten glass by affording himself the opportunity to benefit from happy accidents of process . A great deal of the composition of his vessels is left to chance , not only because of the uncontrollable spalting marks that grow in the wood , but also because Kent never knows what interior figure he might discover during the turning . He always mounts his pieces slightly off-center-so that the axis of the lathe does not run through the pith of the log , but slightly to one side of it . As he turns the exterior profile of the vessel , he engages in what he sees as a conversation : " Everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees with or disagrees with . " In a good piece , the pronounced growth rings of the pine will creates concentric pattern across the bowl 's width , and there will be a dynamic splash of color near the center of the vessel where the sapwood changes to heartwood . Often , Kent creates a star-like pattern of glowing spots near the base of his bowls by aiming for reddish branches that run through the log toward its center . Kent is forever experimenting with new ways to improve the efficiency and the efficacy of his craft . Some of his discoveries are not evident in the finished works , but they are important nonetheless . Recently , for example , he has begun soaking his logs in concentrated dishwashing detergent prior to turning . He thinks that the detergent somehow changes the character of the water in the naturally moist pine , keeping it wet for a longer period . This makes the wood more supple , less apt to split and therefore easier to shave . A visitor to Kent 's recent exhibition at Barry Friedman Ltd. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more obvious instance of experimentation : copper-stitched cracks that arc gracefully around some of his upright bowls . These have their roots , again , in a happy accident : a bowl that shattered while Kent was working on it . Kent 's friend Pat Hickman , a fiber artist who also lives in Hawaii , asked him to scorch the edges of each scrap of wood from the broken vessel . She then laced the fragments back together with gut . After this collaboration , Kent continued to explore the idea on his own . To bridge the cracks in the vessel , he now uses a braided thin-gauge copper wire that is color treated with hydrochloric acid . The air of salvaged ruin that results from the process inspired Kent to call these his Post-Nuclear vesselswith a twinkle in his eye , he 'll compare them to the films Waterworld and Mad Max . But these are serious pieces . Especiallywhen situated amid the glowing perfection of his translucent vessels , they have something of the disturbing quality of wounded bodies . The stitched lacerations become reminders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark but effective contrast , and one that makes the illuminated glory of Ron Kent 's work seem all the more fragile and magical .
