<p> RATING : ( POLITE APPLAUSE ) <p> THE TAMING OF THE SHREW : Comedy . By William Shakespeare . Directed by Kenneth Albers . ( Through October 6 . At the Elizabethan Theatre . ) <p>  --  A whole lot of mind games are going on in " The Taming of the Shrew , " the winning final entry in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival 's outdoor season at the Elizabethan Theatre . <p> The first trick in this handsomely designed period " Shrew " is played on Christopher Sly , the drunken lout of Shakespeare 's prologue that 's often cut in performance . Here , played by Armando Duran , the ale-soaked tinker gets the seat of honor at an English tavern . He and the audience then witness the story of Kate and Petruchio 's marriage as a kind of drink-induced dream . <p> The frame has a liberating effect in Kenneth Albers ' production : It treats a husband 's mastery of his wife as a fable full of winks and theatrical undercutting . <p> Sly himself stumbles into a minor role in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a table to take the part of a widow married off to a suitor on the rebound from Kate 's sister Bianca . A slap is plainly a piece of stage business . Mating and marriage , this " Shrew " says , require a healthy measure of bluffing , deception and disguise . <p> No one understands that more than wife-and-fortune hunter Petruchio ( Jonathan Adams ) , who does n't so much tame his bride as coach her through this game of love and chance . That 's apparent in the scene where he insists that Kate ( Robynn Rodriguez ) call the sun the moon and vice versa at his whim . Adams does n't bully  --  his expression half pleads with her to play along so they can be done with all this and get on with their life together . <p> Playing along is the key to the play 's penultimate scene of spousal command and acquiscence , a disquieting one for modern audiences . By inserting one brief silent entrance  --  audiences should discover this canny touch for themselves  --  Albers suggests that Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bidding . The sharpness of her voice is never really dulled . Adams and Rodriguez both italicize the word " obedience " when they speak it . They 're confederates , who hit on their own unspoken language , the moment they meet . <p> Satisfying as this interpretation is , it does come at the cost of a certain pre-tamed mildness . There 's not as much at stake for a Kate and Petruchio who seem to have an inside track from the start . The parallel pair of Bianca ( Tyler Layton ) and Lucentio ( Charlie Kimball ) make a perfunctory match . This head-game " Shrew " lacks body heat . <p> But even at a stately three hours on opening night  --  some tightening is needed  --  the show is great fun to watch . Susan E. Mickey 's costumes are gorgeously extravagant . Kent Dorsey 's set and lighting cast a cozy amber glow . A hilarious Richard Elmore , as Kate and Bianca 's calculating father , Baptista , mumbles distractedly to himself . Sandy McCallum is an amusing menace as the enfeebled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid work . <p> The match this " Shrew " celebrates , in its lovely and intelligent way , is a marriage of true minds . <p> POIGNANT , STATIC CRUMBS ' <p> RATING : ( ALERT VIEWER ) <p> CRUMBS FROM THE TABLE OF JOY : Memory play . By Lynn Nottage . Directed by Seret Scott . ( Through October 29 . At the Black Swan . ) <p> . <p> Of the two sluggish contemporary plays in the current Ashland repertoire , " Crumbs From the Table of Joy , " at the Black Swan , holds the stronger appeal . Slow as it is to develop , Lynn Nottage 's 1995 memory play about a Southern black family living in Brooklyn in 1950 catches a certain poignant pattern in the quilt of race in America . <p> A dreamy teenager named Ernestine Crump ( the ingratiating Melany Bell ) serves as the narrator and refracting intelligence for the piece . She and her sister Ermina ( Audra Alise Polk ) have moved north from Pensacola with their father , Godfrey ( Tyrone Wilson ) , after their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls on a baker 's salary while holding his own feelings at bay with his devotion to the messianic Father Divine . The black evangelist 's picture is enshrined over the mantelpiece on Yael Pardess ' plain apartment set . <p> The family 's illusory stability is threatened when Godfrey 's sister-in-law Lily ( BW Gonzalez ) moves in after losing her job . A free spirit who embraces communism , Charlie Parker and the Harlem party life , Lily is a card-carrying threat with a mambo beat . When she corners Godfrey with a kiss that reopens his past , he bolts , meets a German woman ( Elizabeth Norment as Gerte ) on a train and marries her on the spot . <p> Slackly written and warmly performed under Seret Scott 's direction , " Crumbs " idles through plenty of flaccid scenes . The confrontations seem devised to illustrate points of view on race , prejudice and the snares of midcentury integration . <p> Lily and Gerte are compared and contrasted as women struggling to invent new lives for themselves . Ernestine tries to resolve ambiguities with Hollywood-addled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for boys . <p> While Nottage builds little dramatic heft or momentum , the play 's static quality becomes a kind of metaphor for the characters ' lives . Cut loose from the constraints and familiar consolations of the South , the Crumps stumble and stagger in the land of mixed promises up north . The resolutions , like much on this " Table , " arrive without much revelation . But this play finally does evoke the cramped texture of life in a Brooklyn apartment 50 years ago . <p> POMPOUS FORCE OF NATURE ' <p> RATING : ( SNOOZING VIEWER ) <p> FORCE OF NATURE : Dramatic comedy . By Steven Dietz . Directed by James Edmondson . ( Through September 17 . At the Angus Bowmer Theatre . ) <p> Steven Dietz 's " Force of Nature , " at the Angus Bowmer Theatre , is a pompous exercise in prolonged exasperation . Doomed to be heard as a pale echo of Tom Stoppard 's " Arcadia " ( done here in 1996 ) , " Nature " uses the design and destruction of a 19th century park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters and their amorous shuffles . <p> The playwright shares the credit , or blame , with Goethe , whose novella " Elective Affinities " is the narrative source . Dietz supplies a present-day prologue before replicating his characters in the German countryside of 1809 . Projections of the landscape , a viney frame around Richard L. Hay 's set and snippets of Schubert , performed by a live duo , create a salon-like cocoon . <p> Edward ( Michael Elich ) and Charlotte ( Robin Goodrin Nordli ) are blissfully married . Cue in the irony right away : Bliss is inherently suspicious . So are aesthetic opinions , frank assertions of feeling and anything written down in private . <p> Clouds soon cover this paper paradise . A captain ( Richard Elmore ) falls for Charlotte . Edward goes for a placid orphan ( Bridgette Loriaux ) . A giddy schoolgirl ( Linda K. Morris ) leads on a bashful schoolteacher ( John Hansen ) . Hearts flutter this way and that . <p> By the time these insufferably coy and self-important characters sort out whom and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinned one 's patience to the breaking point . Dietz seems inclined to parody Goethe 's romanticism at times , then plunges in with both feet himself , creating a sort of snob-appeal soap opera . There are ideas about destiny , free will and what one character calls the " caprice " of heart , but they all sink into a listless morass . <p> Some very good actors , wanly directed by James Edmondson , seem dazed by the material . That , at least , is one thing with which the audience can sympathize . <p> THEATER <p> OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL 2000 : The festival is in Ashland , Ore. , just north of the California border on Interstate 5 .

Euripides ' " The Trojan Women " begins previews July 26 and plays July 29-October 28 at the Angus Bowmer Theatre . <p> RATING : ( ALERT VIEWER ) <p> HENRY V : History . By William Shakespeare . Directed by Libby Appel . ( Through October 29 . At the Angus Bowmer Theatre . ) Dan Donohue plays Shakespeare 's reflective and contradictory monarch in a handsomely spare staging of the historical play . Unfortunately , this chronicle of a king 's foreign campaigns and private ruminations delivers a strangely undynamic conclusion to the cycle begun with the " Henry IV " plays staged here in 1998 and ' 99 . <p> RATING : ( POLITE APPLAUSE ) <p> WIT : Drama . By Margaret Edson . Directed by John Dillon . ( Through Saturday . At the Black Swan . ) A steely English professor dies from ovarian cancer , lecturing as she goes , in this phenomenon of a first play . The humor is as startling as the pain , in a script that does n't achieve all it might . Linda Alper gives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> RATING : ( WILD APPLAUSE ) <p> THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER : Comedy . By Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman . Directed by Warner Shook . ( Through October 28 . At the Angus Bowmer Theatre . ) This 1939 fantasia on celebrity , with Kenneth Albers as a radio personality who steamrolls and charms a small Ohio town , is pure pleasure . It 's buoyantly directed and performed , gorgeously designed and whipped to a comic froth without a puff of effort . <p> RATING : ( ALERT VIEWER ) <p> , 11 THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA : Drama . By Tennessee Williams . Directed by Penny Metropulos . ( Through July 9 and September 19-October 29 . At the Angus Bowmer Theatre . ) This portrait of a defrocked priest 's crackup has enough big speeches , symbols and creaky minor characters to threaten any production . This one has bursts of the play 's fierce , sad and funny music but ultimately sinks under its own solemnity . <p> E-mail Steven Winn at winns@sfgate.com.
