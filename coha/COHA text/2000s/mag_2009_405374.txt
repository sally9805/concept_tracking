I was n't going to try too hard to conform , and I knew that it could possibly not work out . " COMMON , 37 Terminator Salvation costar " One of the most extreme things I 've done is be extremely in love . It was just the whole lifestyle I chose ; I sat down and helped plant a garden with her ! That went a little too far for me . But I was trying to be in a balanced relationship and do some of the things that she would enjoy too . Then afterward you think , Dang -- did I do all that ? " " The craziest thing I ever did ?

Your immediate reaction is you feel like you 're going to start crying . . . . It 's really strange . It 's so not how I thought I would react .

"  - -  ROBERT PATTINSON , 23 Twilight star , to EW.com " I will tell you that within the past couple of years I have probably grown more than I have ever grown in my life .
