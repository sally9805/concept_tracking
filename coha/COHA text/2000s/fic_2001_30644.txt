He climbed the stairs , his boots falling heavily on burgundy floral carpet and , where it was threadbare , on the scarred oak beneath . The stairwell was unlit ; in neighborhoods like this one the bulbs were stolen from the ceiling sockets and the emergency exit signs as soon as they were replaced . John Pellam lifted his head , tried to place a curious smell . He could n't . Knew only that it left him feeling unsettled , edgy . Second floor , the landing , starting up another flight . This was maybe his tenth time to the old tenement but he was still finding details that had eluded him on prior visits . Tonight what caught his eye was a stained-glass valance depicting a hummingbird hovering over a yellow flower . In a hundred-year-old tenement , in one of the roughest parts of New York City .... Why beautiful stained glass ? And why a hummingbird ? A shuffle of feet sounded above him and he glanced up . He 'd thought he was alone . Something fell , a soft thud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds left him uneasy . Pellam paused on the third-floor landing and looked at the stained glass above the door to apartment 3B . This valance %151 ; a bluebird , or jay , sitting on a branch %151 ; was as carefully done as the hummingbird downstairs . When he 'd first come here , several months ago , he 'd glanced at the scabby facade and expected that the interior would be decrepit . But he 'd been wrong . It was a craftsman 's showpiece : oak floorboards joined solid as steel , walls of plaster seamless as marble , the sculpted newel posts and banisters , arched alcoves ( built into the walls to hold , presumably , Catholic icons ) . He %151 ; That smell again . Stronger now . His nostrils flared . Another thud above him . A gasp . He felt urgency and , looking up , he continued along the narrow stairs , listing against the weight of the Betacam , batteries and assorted videotaping effluence in the bag . He was sweating rivers . It was ten P.M. but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonic . What was that smell ? The scent flirted with his memory then vanished again , obscured by the aroma of frying onions , garlic and overused oil . He remembered that Ettie kept a Folgers coffee can filled with old grease on her stove . " Saves me some money , I 'll tell you . " Halfway between the third and fourth floors Pellam paused again , wiped his stinging eyes . That 's what did it . He remembered : A Studebaker . He pictured his parent 's purple car , the late 1950s , resembling a spaceship , burning slowly down to the tires . His father had accidentally dropped a cigarette on the seat , igniting the upholstery of the Buck Rogers car . Pellam , his parents and the entire block watched the spectacle in horror or shock or secret delight . What he smelled now was the same . Smoulder , smoke . Then a cloud of hot fumes wafted around him . He glanced over the banister into the stairwell . At first he saw nothing but darkness and haze ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement blew inward and flames like rocket exhaust filled the stairwell and the tiny first-floor lobby . " Fire ! " Pellam shouted , as the black cloud preceding the flames boiled up at him . He was banging on the nearest door . There was no answer . He started down the stairs but the fire drove him back , the tidal wave of smoke and sparks was too thick . He began to choke and felt a shudder through his body from the grimy air he was breathing . He gagged . Goddamn , it was moving fast ! Flames , chunks of paper , flares of sparks swirled up like a cyclone through the stairwell , all the way to the sixth %151 ; the top %151 ; floor . He heard a scream above him and looked into the stairwell . " Ettie ! " The elderly woman 's dark face looked over the railing from the fifth-floor landing , gazing in horror at the flames . She must 've been the person he 'd heard earlier , trudging up the stairs ahead of him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped it . Three oranges rolled down the stairs past him and died in the flames , hissing and spitting blue sparks . " John , " she called , " what 's ... ? " She coughed . " ... the building . " He could n't make out any other words . He started toward her but the fire had ignited the carpet and a pile of trash on the fourth floor . It flared in his face , the orange tentacles reaching for him , and he stumbled back down the stairs . A shred of burning wallpaper wafted upward , encircled his head . Before it did any damage it burned to cool ash . He stumbled back onto the third-floor landing , banged on another door . " Ettie , " he shouted up into the stairwell . " Get to a fire escape ! Get out ! " Down the hall a door opened cautiously and a young Hispanic boy looked out , eyes wide , a yellow Power Ranger dangling in his hand . " Call nine-one-one ! " Pellam shouted . " Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked hard . He thought he heard screams but he was n't sure because the fire now sounded like a speeding truck , a deafening roar . The flames ate up the carpet and were disintegrating the banister like cardboard . " Ettie , " he shouted , choking on the smoke . He dropped to his knees . " John ! Save yourself . Get out . Run ! " The flames between them were growing . The wall , the flooring , the carpet . The valance exploded , raining hot shards of stained-glass birds on his face and shoulders . How could it move so fast ? Pellam wondered , growing faint . Sparks exploded around him , clicking and snapping like ricochets . There was no air . He could n't breathe . " John , help me ! " Ettie screamed . " It 's on that side . I ca n't %151 ; " The wall of fire had encircled her . She could n't reach the window that opened onto the fire escape . From the fourth floor down and the second floor up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw Ettie , on the fifth floor , backing away from the sheet of flame that approached her . The portion of the stairs separating them collapsed . She was trapped two stories above him . He was retching , batting at flecks of cinders burning holes in his work shirt and jeans . The wall exploded outward . A finger of flame shot out . The tip caught Pellam on the arm and set fire to the gray shirt . He did n't think so much about dying as he did the pain from fire . About it blinding him , burning his skin to black scar tissue , destroying his lungs . He rolled on his arm and put the flame out , climbed to his feet . " Ettie ! " He looked up to see her turn away from the flames and fling open a window . " Ettie , " he shouted . " Try to get up to the roof . They 'll get a hook and ladder ... " He backed to the window , hesitated , then , with a crash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars ' worth of video camera rolling onto the metal stairs . A half dozen other tenants , in panic , ignored it and continued stumbling downward toward the alley . Pellam climbed onto the fire escape and looked back . " Get to the roof ! " he cried to Ettie . But maybe that path too was blocked ; the flames were everywhere now . Or maybe in her panic she just did n't think . Through the boiling fire , his eyes met hers and she gave a faint smile . Then without a scream or shout that he could hear , Etta Wilkes Washington broke out a window long ago painted shut , and paused for a moment , looking down . Then she leapt into the air fifty feet above the cobblestoned alley beside the building , the alley that , Pellam recalled , contained the cobblestone on which Isaac B. Cleveland had scratched his declaration of love for teenage Ettie Wilkes fifty-five years ago . The old woman 's slight frame vanished into the smoke . A wheezing groan of timber and steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something structural gave way . Pellam jumped back to the edge of the fire escape , nearly tumbling over the railing and , as the cascade of orange sparks flowed over him , staggered downstairs . He was in as much of a hurry as the escaping tenants %151 ; though the mission on his mind now was n't to flee the ravaging fire but , thinking of Ettie 's daughter , to find the woman 's body and carry it away from the building before the walls collapsed , entombing it in a fiery , disfiguring grave .
