The Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) , begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health , is one of the largest studies of women 's health ever undertaken . More than 160,000 post-menopausal women ages 50 to 79 were recruited into a variety of trials designed to find the best ways to prevent heart disease , breast and colorectal cancers , and osteoporosis . Thanks to the study 's rigid design , most doctors view the WHI as the definitive word on women 's health . Final results were due out  --  and eagerly awaited  --  in 2005 . But one part of the study , involving more than 16,000 women , was halted last week . These women were taking a combination of estrogen and progestin called hormone-replacement therapy ( HRT ) . Researchers concluded that the risks of HRT clearly outweighed the benefits ( see table ) . Though HRT may still be appropriate as a short-term therapy for menopausal distress , women can not expect it to protect them in the long term against aging-related diseases . Other parts of the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of estrogen alone , continue .  --  By Alice Park <P> What Can I Do Instead ? Hormone-replacement therapy is not the panacea it once appeared to be . But there are plenty of other ways for women to stay healthy well past menopause and to reduce their risk of heart attacks , osteoporosis and other ailments <P> HEART DISEASE Contrary to early studies on HRT , the WHI showed that the hormones do not protect against heart disease . In fact , they raise the risk . A low-fat diet and regular exercise several times a week are better bets . Lowering cholesterol is also important ; if diet is not enough , drugs like statins can help bring cholesterol levels  --  and the risk of a heart attack  --  down . <P>  --  Bottom line : Forget HRT . Get to the gym , and watch your diet <P> OSTEOPOROSIS HRT does keep bones from becoming brittle and reduces the risk of fractures . But there are other ways to keep bones strong that do not carry the same risks . These include calcium supplements , drugs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estrogen-like drugs called SERMs ( raloxifene is an example ) is also showing promise in reducing fractures without raising the odds of breast cancers . <P>  --  Bottom line : Lift weights . Drink milk . Explore other medication options <P> COLON CANCER Colon-cancer rates in the WHI were lower in women taking HRT , but doctors do n't feel that the protection against colon cancer outweighs the risk of breast cancer . Early detection of colon cancer is the best weapon against widespread disease ; regular colon checkups are a good idea . Eating fruits and vegetables and exercising could also help . <P>  --  Bottom line : Eat more veggies , and stop putting off the colonoscopy <P> SKIN When estrogen levels plummet after menopause , skin cells lose their elasticity and youthful appearance . Hair can become dryer and thinner . Though HRT can combat these hallmark signs of aging , the hormones do so at a high price . Creams and moisturizers may not be as effective , but they wo n't pose any serious health risks . And there 's an ever expanding array of cosmetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody ? Or how about just aging gracefully ?
