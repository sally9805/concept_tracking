<p> The world seemed a different tint Tuesday . The orchid flowers in a woman 's dress . The lavender hair ties in a girl 's pigtails . Heck , even the color of the trash cans on the 16th Street Mall took on a new meaning . <p> The day after the biggest win in Colorado Rockies history , Denver was accented in purple . <p> " I think it 's great , " said die-hard Rockies fan Susan Whitcomb . <p> She was standing in line at Coors Field to buy tickets for the National League Championship Series , one whole playoff step beyond the division series that the Rockies start today . She was wearing a purple skirt and a purple turtleneck beneath her sweater . From her ears dangled purple earrings , and a purple medallion hung from her neck . <p> " They made the city remember something that 's special to all of us . . We can stop for a minute , come to a ballgame for four hours and not think about the traumas of the world , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday night 's big win , Tuesday 's celebrations were subtle . There were no pep rallies or parades . The Sports Column bar , cater-corner from Coors Field , closed at 2 p.m. to recuperate from Monday night and prepare for today 's game against the Philadelphia Phillies . <p> Instead , all the cheering Tuesday took place around water coolers and in the dresser mirror . The win made it cool to wear purple again . <p> Rachel Wartes bought a new No. 5 Matt Holliday jersey on Tuesday - to go with her ever-expanding collection of Rockies stuff . She already has a couple Rockies hats , a Rockies lighter and a Rockies towel . <p> " That 's a lie . You do n't actually have a towel , do you ? " her brother , Jonathan , asked . <p> " I do , " Rachel said . " I 'm a big geek . " <p> A block from Coors Field , a purple Rockies flag fluttered from the end of a construction crane . A couple weeks ago , just as the Rockies began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's operator , crawled 100 feet on an inches- wide bar suspended 130 feet off the ground to put the flag there . <p> He says he wo n't take it down until the season is over . <p> " Everybody who drives by has to look at my Rockies flag , " said Pospisil , who adopted the Rockies as his team just a few months ago . " Everybody who walks down the street has to look at my flag . It reminds them of what the team is doing . " <p> And then there is Donald McIlwean . McIlwean , who said he is homeless and not much of a baseball fan , likes seeing the boost the Rockies have given to people around the city . <p> So when he found a purple- <p> and-white Rockies shirt in the street Tuesday , McIlwean took off the shirt he was wearing and put on the Rockies shirt . <p> He did n't really mind that it had a mustard stain on the sleeve . <p> " I 'm happy for them , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " <p> John Ingold : 720-929-0898 or jingold@denverpost.com  --  By the numbers : <p> .340 <p> Matt Holliday 's batting average , enough to win the National League batting title this season <p> 0 <p> The number of retired Colorado Rockies numbers <p> 1 <p> The number of no-hitters thrown at Coors Field . Hideo Nomo of the Los Angeles Dodgers did it in 1996 . <p> 42 <p> The only <p> number retired for all major- league teams . It <p> belonged to <p> Jackie Robinson . <p> 80,227 <p> Number of fans at Mile High <p> Stadium 's first Rockies game on April 9 , 1993 . That set a team record . <p> 26 <p> million <p> The number of hot dogs sold at ballparks during a major-league season . <p> Sources : Baseball Almanac ; Colorado Rockies ; <p> mlb.com <p> Reconstructed fan <p> Know a lot about baseball ? Know next to nothing ? Here are some random tidbits for die-hard fans , jump-on-the- bandwagon fans and fans of the wrong teams . <p> City of Brotherly Tolerance <p> It 's OK to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are few places where it 'll be fine to root for the other guys . <p> Large Marge 's , West 39th Avenue and Kipling Street , Wheat Ridge 303-463-4549 . Marge is a real person , with real South Philly roots . She 'll be happy to make you a cheesesteak , to go , before the games . <p> Denver Public House , 1920 Blake St. , Denver , 303-295-0800 . This self-proclaimed Denver headquarters for the Philadelphia Eagles is just a stone 's throw from Coors Field . Let 's hope nobody throws any as Rockies fever heats up - it 's actually a stop for Rockies regulars too <p> Pat 's Steaks and Bar , 1624 Market St. , Denver , 303-534-1333 . This Lower Downtown hangout is the official home to the Penn State alumni club and very Philly-friendly . They 'll have the game on . <p> Faking It <p> Wan na sound smart about baseball without really trying ? Pull out some of this stuff during the game . <p> Attention to detail <p> The easiest way to look like a savvy baseball fan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second baseman - and advances a runner from second to third base in the process . Though the less knowledgable will wonder why you 're cheering an out , you know that these are the little things that help win ballgames . <p> Laying it on the line <p> Most pitchers ca n't hit a lick , but they work hard on making useful outs such as the sacrifice bunt - " sacrificing " an out - that allows a runner on first or second base ample time to advance into scoring position . The Rockies ' Jeff Francis is particularly adept at this underappreciated art , which earns well-deserved high-fives upon his return to the dugout . <p> To catch a thief <p> When a runner steals a base , do n't automatically blame the catcher for not throwing him out . Elite base-stealers - keep an eye on the Phillies ' Jimmy Rollins - swipe more bases by getting a jump on the pitcher 's slow delivery toward the plate than they do off a catcher 's late throw . <p> - Kevin Simpson <p> A Rockies cocktail <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockies ' run with this purple libation . <p> Purple Reign Cocktail <p> Ingredients <p> 1 generous shot vodka <p> Splash blue curaao liqueur <p> 2 shots cranberry juice <p> Splash grenadine <p> Lemon twist for garnish <p> Glass : Cocktail ( martini ) <p> Directions <p> Fill mixing glass halfway with ice cubes .
