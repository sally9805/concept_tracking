<p> Tax cuts are only the first step if the Republicans are to have a real impact on how the public 's business is done . After all , today 's tax cut can be reversed by tomorrow 's tax increase . What is needed , and what has been sorely lacking from Republican leaders , is a realistic plan for overhauling the entire federal tax structure . <p> They had a splendid opportunity in 1995 , right after they won control of Congress . During that year , I traveled with some Republicans in their districts , and at town hall meetings they always asked the audience , " Do you want to keep the present tax system as it is ? " Never did more than one or two hands go up . But the Republicans never got behind one single plan , and that gave the Democrats time to cast them as favoring " tax cuts for the rich . " The Republicans have been so frightened by the Democratic attack that they have walked away from the solution to their problem and began wringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state of affairs to 20 years ago . The Republican Party was not doing well . Jimmy Carter had been elected president in 1976 , Watergate was still fresh in voters ' minds , and there were big Democratic majorities in Congress . <p> Then , in 1978 , the Republican National Committee did a very interesting thing . Under the chairmanship of a former senator from Tennessee named William Brock ( not considered a staunch conservative by any means ) , who was desperate to pump some life into the party , the Republican National Committee took a policy position : It endorsed the Kemp-Roth bill , which called for a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut . <p> Although the Kemp-Roth endorsement did not result in big gains in the 1978 midterm elections , it did give the party something to build on for the 1980 presidential election , especially after Ronald Reagan embraced Kemp-Roth . <p> Today , however , there is no Kemp-Roth . Competing plans abound , but there is no party position , no solution put forward . <p> The only viable alternatives to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales tax . From what I 've seen , people love the idea of a flat tax , of writing the tax on a postcard , of the rich not having loopholes . A true flat tax of 17 percent , with no exemptions , would come close to replacing the revenue of the current income tax , and House Majority Leader Dick Armey became its most visible proponent in the new Republican Congress in 1995 . <p> But a funny thing happened on the way to the flat tax : The Republican leadership in Congress could n't pull the trigger . House Speaker Newt Gingrich enthusiastically embraced the flat tax , with two little caveats : that two big tax exemptions , for home mortgage payments and for charitable contributions , must remain . Armey argued strenuously against Gingrich 's position . " It 's imperative , " he said . " Every flat tax effort in the past came unraveled when somebody decided , ' I got room for compromise . ' " <p> Sure enough , the unraveling began immediately . The Republican governors of the states with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) insisted on maintaining the deductibility of state income taxes . Then the religious conservatives insisted on including the " pro-family " $ 500-per-child tax credit that had been part of the Contract With America . <p> And there was a darker side to what was happening . Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman dismissed all the talk about scrapping the Internal Revenue Code by noting that the lobbyist community of Washington had a vested interest in complexity . No more bitter foes of tax simplicity could be found than these lobbyists , boasting a symbiotic relationship with members of Congress in both parties who relied on them for campaign contributions . <p> Then came Malcolm S. Forbes Jr . <p> Unintentionally , Steve Forbes was the worst thing to happen to the flat tax . He came out of nowhere in 1996 to mount a serious challenge to Bob Dole for the Republican presidential nomination . Forbes latched on to something that he had been pushing in Forbes magazine and his column for years : the flat tax . In so doing , with plentiful TV advertising financed out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  out of all of the establishment candidates , in fact  --  for being taxers , and the next thing you knew , Forbes was rising in the polls . He was running first in New Hampshire at one point . <p> The other candidates and the party establishment had to counterattack , and they had to kill not only Forbes but the flat tax as well . Lamar Alexander , Phil Gramm , Dole , even Pat Buchanan were all pounding on the flat tax as a plaything of the idle rich . Armey made a great remark at that time : " I understand why they had to kill the messenger , but why did they have to kill the message , too ? " Politically , the flat tax has never quite recovered . <p> What 's worst of all is that the main criticisms of the flat tax fed one another in a vicious circle . First , the critics focused on the exemptions that the flat tax would eliminate , especially the home mortgage deduction , and then they claimed that it was too sweet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home mortgage and charitable deductions ( and a few others ) , you then have to raise the rate to 26 percent or 28 percent . Then the flat tax for lower-income people gets to be too high  --  higher than what they are paying now , but still lower than the current rate the rich are paying . So to make it fairer to ordinary people , you have to have two rates , or even three . And then you have the idea that this is an unfinished book . If you come back the next year , there will be new proposals for new deductions . The next thing you know , you 'll have reconstituted the Internal Revenue Code as it exists today . Friedman had it right . <p> A national sales tax is an even more radical proposal than the flat tax , but potentially it has more going for it . It takes the simplicity argument of the flat tax one step further , as was shown when Armey and Billy Tauzin , a congressman from Louisiana , began a nationwide series of debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ala . Armey displayed a billboard-size facsimile of the 10-line income tax form his flat tax system would use , listing wages and salaries , a standard deduction to be subtracted , and a single tax rate to be applied to all income above the deduction . That 's all . No attached annexes . No complicated computations . No accountants . <p> Tauzin then displayed his poster , the same size as Armey 's but perfectly blank . " Here 's the one you need to send in with my plan , " he drawled . Nothing . People would not even have to keep track of their earnings . The income tax would be abolished and replaced by a levy on all retail transactions , with no exemptions  --  none on food , medical services , home purchases and rentals . All taxpayers would receive a rebate ( the functional equivalent of Armey 's standard deduction , which eliminated income taxes for lower-income Americans ) that would help the poor much more than the rich . <p> In order for a sales tax to be " revenue neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected by the current system , the rate will have to be very high , in the neighborhood of 23 percent ( not counting as much as 5 percent for state tax ) . This is where the Republicans need true fortitude because people will gasp and say , " One-quarter of a dollar on everything ! That 's too much . And it 's not fair ! Why should a guy flipping hamburgers have to pay 25 percent of his income , while a millionaire does the same thing ? " What they do n't take into account , however , is that the millionaire is going to buy different things than the guy flipping hamburgers , and the rebate  --  a fixed amount for all taxpayers based on the cost of essentials  --  will restore the progressivity . If the annual rebate is , say , $ 2,000 , a person making $ 25,000 a year may find it very comfortable , whereas for a person making $ 4 million , it 's meaningless . <p> I believe that if the ordinary working person , the person working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of a clean paycheck with no deductions plus paying this whopping sales tax , or the existing system , that person would take the sales tax . <p> Of course , the Republicans have to be willing to talk it up and explain it . And one other thing is absolutely necessary : the income tax and the 16th Amendment ( which authorized the income tax ) must be repealed , so that Congress can never restore the income tax . The worst of all scenarios would be a sales tax coupled with the existing income tax system . <p> This obviously is going to take some time and some creative thinking . Republican Rep. Christopher Cox of California has proposed a phasing in of the sales tax , or a delay of the sales tax and an interim period under a flat tax . That may be a very salubrious outcome , but to achieve it will be difficult and require real leadership . This is an area where the presidential candidate of the Republican Party , not being part of the Washington congressional establishment , can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have four more years of tinkering and dithering . <p> From Completing the Revolution by Robert D.
