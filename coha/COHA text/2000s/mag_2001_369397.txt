The moment of truth for Joseph Estrada came abruptly at 1 p.m last Friday , when Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo Reyes and Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado informed him that the military was withdrawing its support from him . Concerned that Estrada had not fully understood the finality of the call , Reyes asked his deputy , General Jose Calimlim , to follow up the phone call with a personal visit . Calimlim , a trusted former aide-de-camp to Estrada , was a person who could perhaps coax him through pakikisama ( camaraderie ) , the gentle pressure of " a friend , not an enemy . " <P> When Calimlim arrived at Malacanang Palace , the President was in his office with several advisers , speaking on the phone . In a fit of anger following the call , he ordered everyone out of the office so that he could talk privately with Calimlim . " You too ? " the President then said . " Everybody has forsaken me . " It was clear that he had been drinking , and Calimlim observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You know what I 'll do ? I 'll just wait for one soldier to come in and kill me . " Calimlim later remarked that " it was as if the whole world had collapsed on him without his knowing what hit him . " <P> Following a series of events that were almost as fantastical as the original revolution that toppled Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 , the Philippines was poised to make its fourth transition of power . By Saturday , Estrada , fighting a corruption scandal and a rancorous Senate impeachment trial , had resigned . He appeared to have the votes to survive the Senate action , but the Philippine people had seen enough . They took to the streets peacefully last week , and by week 's end Estrada 's 2 1/2-year rule was finished and his archrival , Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo , was sworn in . <P> The country faces immense challenges . Even before charges were filed against Estrada , sending the peso into a death spiral , economic growth had stalled while debt had soared to record levels , throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endemic in the Philippines , and they were focal points in Estrada 's trial . Century-old demands by Muslim secessionists for an independent Mindanao had quieted at the end of the previous presidency , Fidel Ramos ' , but flared anew under the erratic management of the Estrada administration . But that is not all . <P> By the time Estrada left office , reportedly headed for exile in Australia , the country was suffering its worst crisis of confidence since the Marcos years , with its banks , stock market , regulatory agencies and legislature all tainted by the revelations disclosed during the impeachment trial . Two days before Estrada was forced to resign , his newly appointed Executive Secretary , Edgardo Angara , a respected former Cabinet Secretary , voiced hope that the crisis atmosphere would " help push through those structural reforms that in normal times are so difficult to do , so that we can prove those people wrong who say democracy can never work in the Philippines .
