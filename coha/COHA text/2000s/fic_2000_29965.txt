My father , when he was a boy , took it upon himself to change his name . My grandparents had named him Leroy Martin , but when he went to school and started learning cursive handwriting , he had trouble forming a capital " L. " His answer to the problem was to drop the first two letters of his name and become , from then on , " Roy . " If he could n't be " the King , " he would settle for merely " King . " So began his method for confronting obstacles with swift and decisive action . One day , when I was a little over a year old , he was harvesting corn from a field he leased not far from our farm . It was late afternoon , November 3 , 1956 , and that evening he and my mother were supposed to go to my aunt and uncle 's to watch the election returns on television . Everything I know about that day and the events beyond it I 've had to piece together from bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a few letters I found in a drawer not long after my father died . I know that all our lives began to curve and change that day in the cornfield when the shucking box on the picker clogged , and my father tried to clear it without first shutting off the tractor . The picker , I would later learn from an old newspaper report , was a Wood Brothers corn picker with six " snapping rollers " devices similar to the rollers of a wringer washing machine , only studded with hard rubber fingers . As the rollers turned , these fingers worked the corn on through the shucking box . On this day , a key on one of these fingers had sheared off , and the shucking box was filling up with corn . Myfather was raking the corn out of the box with his right hand when the rollers grabbed onto it and pulled it in . There he was , one hand caught and one hand free , and a split second to decide . He reached in with his other hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine the day anyway I like : a brilliant sun glinting off the picker , the dry leaves of the cornstalks scraping together in the wind ; or perhaps it was overcast , the sky dark with the threat of rain , and perhaps the wind was cold on my father 's face . We lived in a township where the farmland stretched on for miles between houses that sat far back from the roads down long , tree-lined lanes . It was a vast landscape of cornfields , soybean fields , wheat fields . On occasion , a cloud of dust would roll up as a car sped along the County Line Road that passed our lane , and my heart would quicken . I so desperately wanted the car to slow and turn down our lane because I was an only child , eager for company , and often a nuisance to my parents , who were too busy with work to entertain me . Sometimes , particularly during harvest season , weeks would pass and the only people I would see would be my mother and father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to imagine that the mouth of our lane had closed , the way it did in winter when the snows came , and that no one could reach us . I suspect that my father feared that no one would ever find him that day in the cornfield . Fortunately , though , a gravel road ran by the side of the field , and finally another farmer driving past heard my father 's shouts . I do n't know how much time had passed , as my father stood there , the rollers mangling his hands , and I ca n't imagine what those minutes were like for him . I do n't know what my mother was doing when the phone rang in our farmhouse , and she got the news . And when I try to think of myself on that day , it 's nearly impossible . It 's as if I did n't exist . When my parents found out that my mother was pregnant with me , the first thing my father said to the doctor was , " Can you get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when she stunned me with this story after my father had died , she explained that he had asked the doctor that question out of concern . Concern for her and a first pregnancy , obviously unplanned , so late in her life . I imagine all of that is true , but still I find myself searching for signs that they were glad for me . I have my baby book in which my mother recorded the facts of my birth in her neat grade-school teacher 's penmanship , joyful with crisp lines and looping curves . And I remember a toy-sized rubber motorcycle , saved for years , because it was the first gift my father bought for me after I was born . I also have a Christmas greeting card my parents had made in 1955 when I was nine weeks old . It 's the size of a postcard , and there 's a pencil drawing on one half of it . It 's a drawing of a house , set back from the road , the peaks of its gables and the chimney of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picket fence out by the road and a beaming gaslight , and a gate with a Christmas wreath hanging on it . The gate is open and there are puddles of melting snow on the path that leads to the house . The caption reads : Greetings ... from our house to your house My father , at the time , was riding the wave of Eisenhower prosperity . He owned his land and equipment ; he had a wife and a son . So to the left of the Christmas scene on the card , there 's a photograph of me . I 'm wearing a shiny jumper , a short-sleeved white shirt , and a bow tie . My eyes are bright , my mouth is open in a smile , and I look as if I 'm damned glad to see whoever 's out there beyond the reach of the camera 's lens . In fact , I look a little bit like Ikethat same bald head , that winning smile . We 're in the middle of a booming decade , and I 'm a jaunty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it know how happy I am in my home . But , as the years go by , I learn that there are unhappy families all through our part of southern Illinoisfamilies who live in poverty or with some other misery they try to hide . From time to time , I catch glimpses of their troubled lives . One of my schoolmates comes with his father to our farm to beg for work . An older boy kills his father with a shotgun blast . My family harbors its own secret , my father 's temper , which he often turns against me . With his belt , he whips my buttocks , my legs , my armswhatever part of me he can reach . And I love him because he 's the only father I have to love , and I think I must surely deserve his whippings because I 'm a wicked child , too irritable , too stubborn , too full of sass . I do n't know , then , that the moment in the cornfield has already determined years and years of anger between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common between fathers and son . Instead , I rejoice in the few moments of closeness we share . On Sunday afternoons , he turns on the radio and I lie close to him on the couch , dozing to the sounds of a St. Louis Cardinals ' baseball game . On Friday nights , I go with him to basketball games at the high school , and later we stop at a cafe for hamburgers and chocolate milk shakes . He brags about my athletic abilities to his friends . " You should see him throw a baseball , " he says . " I tell you he 's got an arm . " The day of my father 's accident , a surgeon amputated the right hand and the third , fourth , and fifth fingers of the left . Three days later , gangrene set in . This time , the surgeon had to make his cuts above my father 's wrists : three inches above the right one and two inches above the left . While my father was in the hospital , my Grandma Martin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother stayed at the hospital , dozing at night in a chair by my father 's bed . Aunt Ruth was my father 's sister , and years later she told me about those days and how she took me to the hospital waiting room to see my mother , but every time I screamed and cried and refused to let my mother hold me . " You were just a baby , " Aunt Ruth said . " You did n't know what was happening . Your whole world got turned upside down . I guess you were scared . I guess we all were . " My father finally left the hospital , and he and my mother and my Grandma Martin and I went back to our farm . He had to wait nearly six months to go to Barnes Hospital in St. Louis where he would learn how to use a set of artificial hands . " Hooks , " he called them , prongs of steel that curved like question marks at the ends of flesh-colored plastic holsters . The time he spent at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Ruth told me later , was more complicated than most people knew . To those who saw him outside our home , it must have seemed that he was managing his circumstances . One story I remember , although I 'm not sure which relative told it , was one about my father driving his pickup truck to Ed White 's general store . I can imagine the people in that store speaking of him with admiration after he had gone . " Roy Martin . Driving his pickup truck with his stumpswith his stumps , I tell younow how about that ? " But all our lives have private truths , and the truth about my father was that after his accident he brought a deep and abiding rage into our home . His letters from Barnes Hospital are written in a spidery scrawl , the way he must have written when he was a child who was willing to sacrifice the first two letters of his name . The individual characters are legible , and I can imagine my father working hard , the pen held between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . St. Louis , MO 2:15 pm Tues Eve Dear Wife and all , Hope this finds everybody and everything O.K. I am O.K. I get good eats and plenty of them . I slept good last nite . It rained last nite . Looks like it might rain some more . Got my training through for the day . My arms are tired and have n't got a very good place to write . Hope you can make this out . My room mate has been very sick boy since I have been here . There are three of us amputee guys here now . Well my courage is picking up that I might get to come home some day . Goodbye . With lots of love and kisses , Roy I knew those hooks as intimately as I ever knew anything about my father . Thick bands made from rubber wrapped the bases of the steel prongs , and wires ran along the plastic holsters to a harness of canvas straps he wore across his back . When he contracted the muscles in his shoulders , the wires operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched the rubber bands , and the steel prongs opened . I remember the weight of the contraption and the way my mother helped him out of it each night and draped the hooks over the back of a chair . He wore long , white cotton socks on his stumps to protect them inside the plastic holsters , but still , from time to time , he would get a blister , and my mother would have to rub salve on it . I remember the freckled stumps , and the seams at their ends where the surgeon had sutured the skin . I have a newspaper clipping from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , a photograph of my father and his doctor appearing at the Industrial Health Conference at Keil Auditorium . My father is wearing his hooks , and the doctor is holding up the left one . Its prongs are open , right in front of my father 's face , so close he could reach up and grab his own nose . He looks a little scared , uncomfortable there in front of the camera . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand as if he wants to take it . St. Louis , MO 2:00 pm Thurs Eve Dear Folks , Just got dinner ate and a few odd jobs done . We went over to Keil Auditorium about 11 o'clock and gave another demonstration . St. Louis Post-Dispatch took mine and Dr. Dayton 's picture . So watch for my picture in the paper . Might not know who it is . Ha ! Glad to receive your letter . Hope the gilt has good luck with her pigs . May be home this weekend to stay . Got a promise yesterday . If I do get loose , be home on bus . Tell Ma and Lee I am O.K. Bye , Roy And so he came home on the bus , and got a ride from town out to the farm , and walked into the house , and my mother turned and saw him there , with his hooks , her husband , the way she would know him the rest of his life . When I look at photographs of my father before his accident , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out whether they resemble my own , but I can never really decide . His appear to be smaller , his fingers shorter , but that may only be the perspective of the camera . All I can be certain of is the sadness that comes over me whenever I look at those photographs . I want to tell my father about the Election Day that 's coming and that moment in the cornfield when the shucking box will clog . " Shut off the tractor , " I want to tell him , but , of course , I ca n't . He 's there in the photographs , and I 'm here over forty years later , recalling the cold steel of his hooks and how one night , when I was a teenager , he pressed one of them to my throat and pinned me to the wall , and I swore that he would kill me.
