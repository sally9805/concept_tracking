ONE <p> I was sitting at my desk , staring out the window into the drizzly gray light falling behind the Ely Building , when Felicia 's voice came over the intercom . <p> " Ruzak , what are you doing ? " <p> I jerked in my chair . I startle easily , which might explain why I have n't seen a scary movie since Aliens , and I only saw that because of Sigourney Weaver . <p> " I hate November , " I said , raising my voice a little , like a lot of people who use intercoms or talk to foreigners . " I 've lived in Knoxville for over half my life and I ca n't remember one single sunny day in November . " <p> " Maybe you should invest in a light box . " <p> " Light box ? " <p> " This big panel of bright light that depressed people sit in front of . " <p> " Why do they do that ? " <p> " Because they 're depressed , Ruzak . " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm not sure , but I think it stimulates something in their brain . " <p> " I do n't think my brain 's problem is lack of stimulation . " <p> " Probably not , " she agreed . I was n't sure why we were chatting over the intercom when she sat about twenty feet away , though we had remodeled recently , adding a wall and a door , turning the one big room into two smaller rooms . Felicia had said a detective needs privacy when consulting with his clients about their case . I suspected it had more to do with a secretary 's need for privacy when consulting with her boyfriend about their lunch plans . But that was cynical thinking , and I was at war with cynical thinking , the chief reason for half the world 's problems , in my opinion . You have to trust that most people act in good faith . Otherwise , you might as well build your bunker , stock up on the canned goods , and invest in the kind of firepower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the things I could n't understand in that movie was all the slobber . Those creatures seemed very insectlike to me , and I did n't think insects salivated . Of course , they were n't real monsters and it was only a movie . <p> " Now what are you doing ? " she asked . <p> " Wondering if insects salivate . " <p> " You know , that 's really weird . I was just wondering the same thing . " <p> " Really ? " It would be an extraordinary coincidence if she were . " Well , I know mosquitoes have spit . They inject it into the bite to facilitate blood flow . " <p> " Ruzak , only you could get from light boxes to mosquito spit in ten seconds . " <p> I did n't think she was paying me a compliment . I asked , " What 's going on ? " which was more polite than saying , " Why are you hassling me over this damned intercom ? " <p> " There 's somebody here to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments , so I asked , " Do they have an appointment ? " <p> " He says he does n't need one . " <p> My heart rate clicked up a notch . People who do n't need appointments are not usually the kind of people you want to meet with . <p> " Okay , show him in . " <p> The door opened and I recognized him right away , with the square-shaped head , the ill-fitting suit , the slight paunch and rounded shoulders . I could see Felicia over his shoulder making a slicing motion across her throat and I nodded toward her , saying , " Thanks , Felicia , I 'll take it from here . " <p> He sat in the chair in front of my desk , I sat in the chair behind my desk , and he was smiling with great satisfaction . <p> " Mr. Ruzak , do you remember me ? " he asked . <p> " Oh , " I said . " You bet I do . I 've always been pretty good with faces . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can I get you anything ? We 've got practically everything , even Starbucks coffee . " <p> " No thank you , " he said , crossing his legs and setting his briefcase on his lap . <p> " You sure ? Once a week , my secretary picks up a pound . That way I avoid the lady on the cup . " <p> " What lady ? " <p> " You know , the creepy Starbucks lady . Although she is on the bag too , but it 's usually my secretary who makes the coffee , so I do n't have to look at her . " <p> " You do n't have to look at your secretary ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't mind that . I was talking about the Starbucks lady . " <p> His smile had fled . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , Mr. Ruzak . " <p> " She 's on all the cups . Check it out next time you 're at Star-bucks . " <p> " I do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acquired taste , like beer . " <p> He shook his head quickly , as if he were clearing out the cobwebs , and said , " You must know why I 'm here , Mr. Ruzak . " <p> " I 've got a pretty strong suspicion , Mr. Hilton . " <p> " Hinton . " <p> " Hinton . Hinton . That 's right . Sorry . " <p> He pulled a computer printout from his briefcase . " Mr. Ruzak , I 've brought your test results .... " <p> " Okay , " I said . " I 've already seen them . I know you did n't come looking for excuses , but I was never very good with tests . " <p> " I , " he said , " do n't care . " <p> " I did n't think so . I do n't suppose you looked carefully at my door before you came in . Right below the ' Highly Effective Detection ' name thingy ? ' Theodore Ruzak , Investigative Consultant . ' We added that so potential clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Your clients might be confused , Mr. Ruzak . And , based on your test results , you are most definitely confused . But the state of Tennessee is not confused . All applicants must pass this test in order to obtain the license to practice private detection . " <p> " And that 's a good thing , " I said . " You would n't want just any yahoo dicking around with detection , private or otherwise . " <p> " No , we do not . " <p> " Well , I 'm already signed up for the next test , and this time I 've got high hopes of passing it . My problem was I did n't sleep well the night before , and this time I 'm planning to take a pill . Not a prescription , but something over-the-counter . " <p> " That 's entirely up to you , Mr. Ruzak . " <p> " Well , that 's a relief and one of the reasons this is such a great country , Mr. Hilton . Hillon . Hellion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right . And while you 're reloading ... " He pulled a document from his briefcase and slid it across the blotter toward me . <p> " What 's this ? " I asked . My name was in all caps in the left-hand corner , like this : THEODORE RUZAK d/b/a THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DETECTION AND INVESTIGATION COMPANY a/k/a " THE DIC " . Above it was this : THE STATE OF TENNESSEE VS . <p> " A cease-and-desist order , Mr. Ruzak . Effective immediately , you are no longer in business . " <p> " Wow . Just like that ? " <p> He was smiling at me like every villain in every B movie I 've ever seen . If he 'd had a mustache , he 'd have twirled it . <p> " Just like that , " he said . <p> " You know , I 'm not much for irony , but this strikes me as ironic . " <p> " How so ? " <p> " Up till this minute I was making a living off the fact that people do bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are shutting me down . " <p> " I do n't see the irony in that . " <p> " Well , like I said . " <p> " I understand from your application you used to be a night watchman . Perhaps you could apply for that job . " <p> " Does career counseling come with your work ? " I asked . " That part of the service ? " <p> " There 's no need for bitterness , Mr. Ruzak . " <p> " I guess not in general . But this is a particular case . " I was regretting offering him the coffee . " I was thinking about the movies before you came in . If this was a movie and I was your typical hard-case gumshoe , I 'd tear up this court order and throw the pieces back into your face . " <p> " I 'm a lucky man , then , that you are neither hard-case nor a gumshoe . " <p> He stood up . I stayed down . Felicia appeared in my doorway . <p> " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking over Hinton 's shoulder at me . " That 's all you 're gon na do ? " <p> " You have to the end of business today , Mr. Ruzak , " Hinton said , tipping his hat in my direction before slipping it on his square head . " Or I come back with the Knox County Sheriff 's Department . " <p> He left . Felicia sat in the chair he vacated and stared at me . <p> " I flunked the test , " I told her . <p> " You never told me you flunked the test . " <p> " I meant to . Okay , that 's a lie . What I meant to do was take it again and hope for the best . " <p> I braced myself for the explosion . But all she did was drop a piece of paper on top of the court order . <p> " What 's this ? " <p> " What 's left in the bank account . " <p> " Really ? I thought we had more than that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms over her chest and waited . <p> " Okay , " I said . " But let 's not jump the gun here . The next test is coming up in a couple of months . There 's enough here to cover both our expenses till then . Think of it as a paid vacation . " <p> " You 're such a ... " She searched for the word . <p> " Dumb-ass ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Mediocrity ? " <p> " Uh-uh . " <p> " Ne'er-do-well ? " <p> " Optimist . What 's the plan in two months when you flunk it a third time and all the money 's gone ? " <p> " It 's hard for me to plan for failure . " <p> " That 's really strange coming from you , Ruzak . You would think that 'd be second nature by now . " <p> She spun out of the chair and was gone , slamming my door behind her . No more than thirty seconds later  --  time to grab her purse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alone with my thoughts  --  and my ferns , which were slightly droopy , making me wonder if I had them too close to the cold windows  --  I stared out into the alley below , into a world bled colorless by the rain , at the jumble of old filing cabinets and bent metal trash cans and dead stalks of weeds glistening in the rain . They say even the greatest minds suffered from melancholy , though I wasted another minute or two trying to think of a single genius who suffered from the blues . Lincoln , maybe , though he 'd had a bit more on his plate than I did . <p> A voice cried out from the wilderness of the vestibule . <p> " Hello ? Hello , is anybody home ? " <p> I sighed . I knew that voice . I opened my door and Eunice Shriver shuffled in , wearing a wool overcoat speckled with rain and carrying a canvas tote . She plopped her eighty-plus self into one of my chairs and waited for me to sink into my leather executive chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank , I wondered if that might affect its resale value . <p> " Theodore , " she said , " you do not look well . " <p> " It 's this weather , " I said . " You know , rainy days and Mondays . " <p> " Rainy days and Mondays ? " <p> " Always get me down . It 's a song . " <p> " I do not listen to the rap music or that abhorrent hip-hop . " <p> " Neither do I. That song 's pretty old . " <p> " Meaning I should know it since I am , too ? " <p> " No , meaning it predates rap and hip-hop by at least a generation . " <p> " Theodore Ruzak . " She sniffed . " Music critic . " <p> " More an aficionado than a critic , Eunice . I struggle against judgmentalism . " <p> " ' Judgmentalism ' ? Is that a word ? " <p> " I do n't know . I 'm no lexicographer . " I almost added I was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-pity . Our reactions to personal catastrophe are minefields to be gingerly navigated . I wondered if I had read that somewhere , or if it was original . Sometimes I thought things I ascribed to myself only to find out days or weeks later that somebody else said it about a hundred years ago . <p> " Every time I see you we spin off on tangents , Theodore , " she said , waving her mottled , big-knuckled hand in a circular motion , to demonstrate a tangent . <p> " Well , like the poet said , the truth lies in the parentheses . " <p> " What poet ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Then how do you know he said it ? " <p> " Well , I may not know who said , ' Ask not what your country ... ' But that does n't mean it was n't said , Eunice . " <p> " Kennedy said that . " <p> " I know . " <p> " Then why did you say you did n't ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was making a point . " <p> " Well , perhaps there 's a first time for everything . " Eunice was eighty-six , and I figured the weather must be wreaking havoc on her joints . Thinking about her aching joints relieved some of the pressure in my chest  --  or rather moved the pressure a bit to one side , because empathy resides at a different spot than self-pity . I think the ancient Egyptians figured out that one . <p> " Theodore , I have come today for two reasons . " <p> " I 'll guess the first , " I said . " You want to know if there 's any progress on your case . " <p> " Effective , Mr. Detective , " she said . " Highly effective . " <p> " There is n't , " I told her . " Eunice , nobody is trying to kill you . People love you . They wish only the best for you . " <p> " You are hopelessly nanve . " <p> " Oh , you bet . But you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative . " <p> " Have you looked into the bag boy at Fresh Market ? " <p> " The one with the beady eyes ? " " The one with the mole . Beady Eyes was fired months ago . " <p> " He was ? " <p> " I made quite sure of that ! " <p> " Well , in that case he might be holding a grudge , but bag boy is one of those professions where you can generally find work anywhere . " <p> " One should never underestimate the maliciousness of bag boys . " <p> " Eunice , you know what it took me a long time to learn ? We 're not as important as we think we are . " <p> " And what is that supposed to mean ? " <p> " It means believing somebody 's out to get you wo n't make you important , and neither will confessing to crimes you did n't commit . " <p> " I believe you just called me a liar . " <p> " I do n't think you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive . Besides , even if you 're right and somebody is trying to kill you , I ca n't do anything about it . " <p> " And why is that ? " <p> I told her . She accused me of making it up just to get her off my back . I showed her the court order . <p> " Oh , Theodore , why did n't you study ? " <p> " That 's the distressing thing . I did . " <p> " Well , you 're still young . You 'll land on your feet . " <p> I nodded . " I 've got my fingers crossed there 's an opening at Fresh Market . " <p> She laughed . I 'm convinced old ladies have the best-sounding laughter on earth . She picked up her tote and plopped it into her lap . <p> " I 'm glad you told me , " she said . Somehow my losing the business had lifted her spirits . Like mine , her ache must have shifted . " Because I 've begun a little project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , too , of course . " <p> She fumbled in the tote . <p> " You 're knitting me a sweater , " I said . <p> She hauled out about half a ream of typing paper and slapped it on my blotter . I read the title on the cover page : Theodore Ruzak , The Highly Effective Detective . It was an eye-catching title , but I managed to tear my eyes away to look at her , cheeks that rosy red of a lot of old ladies , eyes sparkling in the center of their puffy folds . <p> " You remember we discussed committing your story to paper some months back , " she said . " I 've decided to take the liberty . " <p> " Committing my story to paper ? " <p> " Of course , the devil is in the details , as they say , and I 've reached a point in the narrative where I simply must have your input . " <p> " You 're writing my life story ? " I flipped through the pages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eunice s , and every now and again somebody ejaculated , as in " ' That killer 's as good as caught ! ' ejaculated Theodore . " The thought of crazy old Eunice Shriver writing a book about me was flattering and unnerving at the same time . " Why ? " <p> " To immortalize you ! " she fairly shouted . " Holmes had his Watson . Marple had her Christie . Nancy Drew had her Keene . Ruzak shall have his Shriver ! " <p> " Oh , Eunice . Eunice , that 's flattering as all get-out ; I 'm touched , really , but  --  " <p> " There are gaps , of course . Some things that I do not know , details and conversations and other matters that only you could know . I have been focusing on our relationship for the most part , but they 'll want to know more about the actual case and your secretary , I suppose , and how precisely you managed to bag the killer . " <p> " They ? Who 's ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally ! " <p> " Eunice , I do n't have any readers . " <p> " You will ! " <p> " I do n't want any readers . " <p> " Nonsense ! What detective in his right mind does n't want readers ? " <p> " I 'm not a detective . " <p> " You were ! " <p> " Then I 'm not in my right mind . " I scooped up the manuscript and held it out for her . She did n't take it . The loss in her eyes was profound , and I looked away . <p> " You think I 'm ridiculous , " she said , voice quivering . <p> " No . " <p> " A silly old woman with delusions of literary grandeur . " <p> " Of course not . " <p> " I wrote poetry when I was younger . " <p> I was n't sure what that had to do with anything , but I told her that was terrific . I was impressed . And how in the world could I accuse her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out the manuscript until my forearm began to ache . <p> " If you really feel it 's necessary , " I said , " I guess you could just make up the rest . " <p> " What rest ? " <p> " The gaps . " <p> " But this is n't fiction , Theodore . " <p> " It would probably work better that way , " I said . " Maybe you could put under the title : ' Based on a True Story . ' " <p> She snorted with disgust . I figured it was disgust , anyway . Is it possible to snort with something else ? Is there another emotion that causes you to snort ? <p> She leaned forward and snatched the papers from my cramping fingers . <p> " I shall finish with or without your help , Theodore . Do you know why ? " <p> " No . Why ? " <p> " Because at the ripe old age of eighty-six , I have finally stumbled upon my life 's calling . I shall be known to posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She stuffed the manuscript back into the tote and pushed herself out of the chair . We argued all the way to the door . Then I gave up . What did I care if she wrote about me ? You have to have purpose in your life . The fact that I had just lost mine made this painfully obvious . Loss makes a lot of things painfully obvious . <p> Excerpted from The Highly Effective Detective Goes to the Dogs by Richard Yancey <p> Copyright 2008 by Richard Yancey <p> Published in 2008 by Thomas Dunne Books St. Martin
