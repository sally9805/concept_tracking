LIFE LESSONS Photograph Photograph // The ten most important lessons you can teach your child A strong sense of self is the most important legacy a Black mother can give her child . Here are some basic truths every child should know to become a self-confident adult : 1 . Your body is beautiful . Children should respect all bodily functions and know proper names for all their body parts , including genitals . 2 . Your body belongs to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to touch their body without their permission , " says Gail Wyatt , sex educator and author of the upcoming No More Clueless Sex ( John Wiley &; Sons ) . " They need to know how to protect their bodies and who should or should not touch them and how . " When they 're 2 or 3 , talk about the difference between good touch and bad touch and why it 's important not to keep secrets about things that make them feel bad . Two good books : for parents , From Diapers to Dating by Debra Haffner , and for kids 4 to 8 , What 's the Big Secret ? ( Little Brown ) by Laurie Krasney and Marc Brown . 3 . Money does n't grow on trees . ATMs are n't money  --  making machines , and you ca n't buy the entire toy store by simply showing a credit card . It 's important that you help your little ones understand the value of money while they 're still young . Teach them how it 's earned and saved . Reinforce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart and soul that counts most-not the toys , games and stuff she has . 4 . You have a choice . Although our parents may have come from the " Do as I say ! " school , we understand that children develop a healthy sense of self-confidence when they know they have choices . When they 're very young , that may be as simple as offering them the opportunity to choose between two things you 've selected ( the apple or the banana ) . 5 . People come in many skin colors . According to Marguerite Wright , Ed.D. , author of I 'm Chocolate , You 're Vanilla ( Jossey-Bass ) , although kids from birth to about 5 may notice differences , they " really do n't attach any social or emotional importance to skin color . " Deal with your own biases , but do n't pass them on to your kids . 6 . We are a great people . While you should n't overemphasize race , Wright believes it is important to instill a sense of racial pride . Celebrate holidays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a rich and beautiful culture . 7 . Violence does n't solve problems . That begins with you . Experts agree that corporal punishment rarely corrects the behavior it 's meant to change . Child psychologist Howard Stevenson says that spanking sometimes works in the short term , but it 's not a long-term solution ; parents need to carefully assess its effectiveness . And remember that harsh language is a kind of violence whose effects can last longer than a spanking. 8 . I 'm the adult here . Stevenson says that as early as 9 months , children need to know consistently what behavior is acceptable and what is not . If you need help defining this , take a parenting workshop or turn to books such as Stickin ' to , Watchin ' Over and Gettin ' With ( Jossey-Bass ) by Stevenson , Gwendolyn Davis and Saburah Abdul-Kabir. 9 . You are safe . In the aftermath of last year 's terrorist attacks , it is especially important to convey this message to your child . The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell children that the violence they may see or hear about on the television is confined to certain areas and that they will not be harmed . 10 . You are loved . " It 's critical that there be no confusion in a child 's mind about how much you love him and how you love him , " says Stevenson . " It should be in how you speak to him , how you touch him and every way you deal with him . From there you can build a base of protection and correction . " It 's the most important lesson of all .
