<p> The Pulaski Skyway , a three-mile long steel silhouette rising and falling across the Meadowlands of New Jersey , has over the years attracted its share of praise , curiosity and , for those paying close attention to " The Sopranos , " a glancing kind of television fame . <p> The bridge , named after Casimir Pulaski , a general in the Continental Army during the American Revolution , was called the " most beautiful " steel bridge by the American Institute of Steel Construction the year it was finished . It was destroyed by Orson Welles 's fictional Martians in his famous " War of the Worlds " radio broadcast in 1938 . And more recently , its blackened steel beams flickered past Tony Soprano 's face in the opening sequence of the hit HBO show . <p> In the last week , though , the 75-year-old bridge has gained another kind of notoriety : It is one of 756 bridges across the country built in the same antiquated design as the bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis . These bridges , engineers now say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of just one piece of steel could send them plummeting to the ground . <p> And the Pulaski Skyway , again like the Minnesota bridge , has been found in recent years to be " structurally deficient , " a term indicating concern about several key aspects of its durability , but not a risk of imminent collapse . <p> Gov . Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey insisted this week that all the state 's bridges were safe , but suggested that the skyway might be at a critical juncture . <p> Mr. Corzine said that instead of spending the $10 million a year now planned to keep the skyway safe and operational , it might be wiser to replace it . But it is not clear where the $1 billion needed to do so would come from . <p> The exact nature of the government 's concern about the skyway has not been made public . This spring , inspectors finished the complete inspection of the bridge that the federal government requires every two years . <p> But the State Department of Transportation , citing security concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss whether the findings differed substantially from those of the previous inspection . Another inspection , in response to the Minneapolis collapse , is under way . <p> The skyway passed its previous inspection , in 2004 , though problems were noted , according to federal data . <p> The federal government 's rating system scores bridges on a scale of 0 to 9 in several categories , with 9 being perfect and 0 requiring a shutdown . In 2004 the skyway was rated 4 for the physical condition of its structural members and 5 for the physical condition of its piers and other substructure components . <p> Those numbers are not dire . But the scores are similar to those assigned to the bridge in Minneapolis . It received a 4 for structure and 6 for substructure during its most recent inspection . <p> For all its similarities to the Minneapolis bridge , which was completed in 1967 , the Pulaski Skyway , though 35 years older , may have some advantages . <p> For example , the skyway may be much more sturdy than the bridge in Minneapolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology . Because less was known then about how much weight various materials could handle , engineers of the era generally added more steel support than was later considered necessary . <p> " A lot of the bridges built back in the first half of the 20th century are a lot more robust , " he said . <p> The utility of the skyway has rarely been in doubt . Originally called the Newark-Jersey City viaduct , it was built to move the thousands of cars and trucks a day that began to emerge from the Holland Tunnel after it was completed in 1927 . <p> Its fast passage across the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers provided the final link between Manhattan and the nation 's first " superhighway , " the transcontinental Lincoln Highway . On its first day of operation in 1932 , 48,611 cars crossed the skyway ; today the number averages 85,000 , according to the Department of Transportation . <p> " The thing that the Pulaski Skyway does is that it allows you to leap over all the railyards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , " said Jeffrey M. Zupan , a senior fellow for transportation at the Regional Plan Association . " It 's an extraordinary thing . " <p> As swift as that eight-minute-or-so journey can be , it is also often an unsettling experience . The skyway was modeled after railroad bridges , with lanes that were uncomfortably narrow and , originally , undivided . <p> Those factors proved deadly to car passengers . In the skyway 's first 14 months of operation , 14 people in cars were killed in crashes with trucks on the bridge . Jersey City banned trucks from the bridge in early 1934 . <p> " When they banned truck traffic there , they made the skyway 90 percent obsolete of its intended purpose , " said Steven Hart , author of " The Last Three Miles : Politics , Murder , and the Construction of America 's First Superhighway , " a recently published history of the skyway . <p> But removing trucks may have lengthened the skyway 's lifespan , saving it from years of added weight and vibrations , which engineers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack , Mr. Schuring said . <p> The distinctive design in question is known as " steel truss deck , " in which the roadway sits atop interconnected triangles of steel girders . The Pulaski Skyway , composed of steel truss decks and two cantilevered sections over the rivers , is the eighth-most heavily traveled such bridge in the nation , and the busiest in the metropolitan region , according to federal bridge data . <p> All bridges of that design are being reinspected in the wake of the Minneapolis collapse . There are eight in New Jersey , 33 in New York and six in Connecticut . <p> The skyway last underwent major repairs in the mid-1980s , when its roadway was resurfaced and steel supports were reinforced at a cost of about $19 million . <p> A new round of repairs is set to begin this month . They include replacing the pier caps , the points where the steel structure connects and transfers weight to the massive concrete pillars below , key points of stress . The safety wall along the side of the lanes will also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadway deck will be removed and replaced in sections . <p> " These are our best efforts to rehabilitate the Pulaski Skyway to a fully functional state , " said Sandra Gutarra , a spokeswoman for the State Department of Transportation . <p> The repairs , combined with the lucky turning points in the skyway 's past , have led experts to refrain from raising alarm . <p> " I would not panic about the Pulaski , " Mr. Schuring said . " We have to continue to watch it closely , but I would not just say that we have to quickly replace it . " ##
