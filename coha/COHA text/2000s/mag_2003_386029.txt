President Bush wants faith-based programs to take over social services . But what happens when evangelical Christians try their hand at running prisons ? <p> PASTOR DON RAYMOND is n't trained in corrections and is not employed by the government , but he runs a new 140-person wing of the Ellsworth , Kansas , medium-security prison that draws inmates from throughout the state system . <p> In the phylum of prison staff , Raymond defies classification . He is not a tight-lipped warden , vindictive guard , or burnt-out social worker . In an industry that thrives on invisibility and resents the media , Raymond drives 140 miles , past newly seeded wheat fields and the rhythmically bowing heads of oil-well pumps , to pick me up from the airport , where he offers prayers of thanksgiving for my visit and " for the ministries of writing He has blessed Samantha with . " In a building that hums with hostility , Raymond is attentive , unguarded , gentle . Prison staff are not permitted to share personal information with inmates , address them by their first names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to speak privately with a counselor , he has to fill out a Form-9 . But these restrictions do not apply to Raymond , who often puts in 14-hour days working the cellblocks of the state 's prisons , recruiting men to transfer to his wing . In inmates ' marked bodies , averted eyes , and bristling rage , Raymond sees the debts and wounds , not of poverty or addiction , but of sin alone . He believes there is only one cure-Jesus Christ and that it is a perfect and complete cure . <p> Once at the Ellsworth prison , Raymond and I quickly pass through the general population area , avoiding the acid attention of men slouched in front of bolted-down TVs , fingering the buttons of their state-issue work shirts . " I seeeeee you , " an inmate coos at me through his window grate as we pass . " Do n't think I ca n't see you . " " I got to talk to you , girl ! I got to talk to you right now ! " another barks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is identical to the rest of the prison but feels like an entirely different place , an excessively well-lit church basement perhaps . Inmates have arranged their desks , stacked with Bibles and workbooks , in a tidy circle . One rushes to pull a chair out for me ; others reach out for a double-handed shake or a shoulder clap poised to morph into a full-body hug . These inmates see plenty of women ; Raymond keeps a steady flow of church volunteers , mentors , and teachers circulating throughout the wing . They do n't behave toxicly , because the InnerChange staff does n't treat them like they are murderers or rapists , even though some are . <p> Before Bible study starts , they want to ask me some questions : " Where are you from ? " " Have you been saved ? .... Do you know Jesus ? " After class , perhaps unsatisfied with my answers  --  I 'm Jewish  --  Raymond presents me with a pocket-size New Testament , " a gift from the guys . " He then invites me to spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive Scripture library more closely . A passing guard catches a glimpse of us crouched on the inmate 's cot and turns purple . " Do n't you know that no one is allowed in cells ? " he bellows at Raymond . " Not even me , and I am a guard ! " <p> Raymond is undeterred . Later that evening , after most prison staff have left , he leads InnerChange inmates across grounds off-limits to them because they are outside the view of security cameras . They set up amplifiers and a drum kit for an evening revival in the mess hall . With a backup band of inmates chanting , " You are the air I breathe , " Raymond preaches until the sun sets and goldfinches circle the indigo sky outside . By the end of the revival , Raymond has achieved his desired effect : The room is still with prayer ; inmates are holding each other ; some are crying . At 9:30 , Raymond can be found in a cellblock , bent at the waist , his face pressed into the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves the prison to eat a Dairy Queen dinner in the front seat of his pickup , the night is speckled with stars . <p> AIDED BY FRIENDS in high places  --  such as the White House  --  legislators in Kansas , Iowa , Texas , and Minnesota have , in the last six years , turned over portions of their prisons , and corrections budgets , to the politically powerful evangelical Christian group , Prison Fellowship Ministries , which pays Raymond 's salary . The largest prison ministry in the world , PFM sends more than 50,000 volunteers into prisons in every state with the goal of " declaring the good news of Jesus Christ to those impacted by crime . " The Ministries ' " Angel Tree " program has presented more than 4 million children of inmates with Christmas presents and evangelistic materials . The goal is clear . As Mark Earley , who was attorney general of Virginia before becoming president of PFM in 2002 , writes on its website , " I believe God is going to raise up the next generation of leaders for His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their children . " <p> In 1997 , as part of a larger effort to increase funding for faith-based services in Texas , then-Governor George W. Bush gave PFM the chance to do more than just visit prisons ; he allowed it to run a 24-hour " immersion " program in collaboration with the Department of Corrections . Three other states have since followed suit , and PFM plans to be in five more states by 2005  --  " God does amazing things ! " enthuses InnerChange executive director Jerry Wilger . In June , President Bush held a press conference with InnerChange officials and inmates , touting a University of Pennsylvania study that he , Majority Leader Tom DeLay , and the Wall Street Journal all claimed showed that InnerChange lowered recidivism . Critics later pointed out that the study actually indicated the opposite was true . In any case , InnerChange represents the cutting edge of President Bush 's faith-based initiatives , which seek to have religious groups take over social services once provided by state and federal agencies and , in so doing , fulfill two goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrinking government . <p> In Kansas , most inmates two years away from possible parole are eligible to join InnerChange . Inmates who choose to live on its wing rise at 5 a.m. for morning prayers and bustle purposefully through a day packed with studying Scripture , practicing gospel music , learning life skills , and undergoing " biblically based " therapy designed to transform them through an " instantaneous miracle . " Their study regimen includes lessons in creationism and an option to " convert " out of homosexuality . When I asked Alexander Curls , on work release after three years of InnerChange , what he was taught about other faiths , he said emphatically , " I found out that a lot of good people are going straight to hell ! " <p> Many inmates , however , do n't join for the ideology . They do it to transfer from other parts of the prison system , and because completing InnerChange amounts to a get-out-of-jail-free card with the Parole Board : " We have a very positive relationship with the board . Sometimes they just give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at work release , ' " said Larry Furnish , InnerChange program manager at Ellsworth . Kansas has only 298 coveted work-release positions for about 9,000 total inmates ; InnerChange graduates are all but guaranteed a space as well as help finding a job and housing after they get out . <p> Meanwhile , joining InnerChange brings about a radical change in lifestyle . The movements of the general population are highly restricted . Those who share a snack or a book will likely be written up for " dealing and trading " ; during visiting hours , hugs with family members are timed . But InnerChange " members " have good prison jobs and electric guitars . They are called by their first names , hugged and told they 're loved , and , because the program emphasizes reconciliation with family members , are provided much greater visitation rights  --  their wives can join them for Bible study and picnics . <p> And then there is the pizza . When a new class of inmates joins InnerChange , the staff orders 100 large pies , a fact that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aware of . " We are stretching the local Pizza Hut to its absolute capacity , " InnerChange office administrator Gale Soukup told me with a worried look , " and they 're the only game in town . " <p> Paid for in part by fees charged to the general population , InnerChange also offers substance-abuse treatment and free computer training , hot commodities in a time of budgetary woes . This year , the GED program Ellsworth offers regular prisoners was cut in half , the substance-abuse program eliminated . General-population inmates are still offered a computer class through the local community college , but as it costs $150 , and men who are lucky enough to land a prison job make an average of 60 cents a day , the general population 's six computers sit under dust covers most days . As Issac Jarowitz , an Ellsworth inmate who is n't in InnerChange , noted grudgingly , " The Christians do lots of stuff the state used to do , like vocational programs , but now they 're only for believers . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gesturing to the InnerChange ID card that inmates wear on a " What Would Jesus Do ? " neck chain , " to everything they need . " <p> PRISON FELLOWSHIP MINISTRIES , the group that runs InnerChange , was founded in 1976 by Charles Colson , the " evil genius " of the Nixon administration ; one of his unrealized dirty tricks was a proposal to firebomb the Brookings Institution . For his Watergate crimes , Colson served seven months . After being released , he remade himself as a poster boy for the redemptive power Christ can have on criminals and the government , and has since become one of " America 's most powerful Christian conservatives , " according to the Weekly Standard . Still chairman of PFM , Colson is also a prolific writer . In his column for Christianity Today or his daily radio address , Colson can be found criticizing PBS for " promoting " evolution , hawking a brochure called " Rick Santorum Is Right , " or claiming that the real weapons of mass destruction " are not in Baghdad " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In Colson 's first novel , Gideon 's Torch , the National Institutes of Health plans to harvest brain tissue from partial-birth abortions to treat AIDS patients , a scheme funded by Hollywood galas . Colson even has his anti-abortionist heroes firebomb the NIH . Gideon 's Torch , like much of Colson 's writings , ultimately argues that government without faith is doomed to destruction and corruption . <p> Colson also drums on the clash between Christianity and Islam , a religion , he told Fox TV , " dedicated toward hatred , " but that can be defeated by aggressive evangelizing . Last year , he wrote several op-eds warning that Muslim inmates present a terrorist threat , a message that 's trickled down to InnerChange . Raymond refused to participate in an interfaith conference at Ellsworth last year because he thought the Muslim organizers were trying " to recruit guys . " Texas InnerChange inmates told me they watched an evangelical documentary on a Christian woman who 'd been raped by Muslims . <p> At Ellsworth , Muslim inmates like Michael Patterson say that their practices have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families are treated to a Christmas dinner shared with prison staff , this year the Ramadan feast ( which Muslim inmates must pay for and their families ca n't attend ) was denied . InnerChange inmates engage in spontaneous prayer throughout the day , but Lakota , Muslim , and other inmates in the general population need approval to pray together . " If anyone but the Christians gets together for a prayer , security hits the panic button , " Patterson said , adding that the prison 's chaplain would not order Islamic texts and that an inmate who started studying Arabic was called into the warden 's office . ( The warden denies these reports . ) To Patterson , this pattern suggests that " through a variety of avenues , the prison is trying to pressure inmates to join InnerChange to turn the whole prison into a Christian place . " <p> That sounds paranoid , and Warden Ray Roberts ( who 's since become warden of another Kansas prison ) said inmates are not pressured , implicitly or explicitly , to join InnerChange . But Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief all told me they would like the entire prison turned over to InnerChange . While walking with Raymond , an inmate suggested airbrushing a giant mural of Jesus on the side of the prison . " The state wo n't let that fly , " Raymond said ruefully . " Wait until we take the place over . " <p> WARDEN ROBERTS previously served as director of the InnerChange unit in Texas , and he did his best to welcome the ministry to Ellsworth . Inmates in the program repair wheelchairs for an evangelical group that distributes them , and the gospel , in the Third World . When budget cuts affected state funding for InnerChange , Roberts allowed its inmates to hawk BBQ bacon cheeseburgers to the general population . <p> The prison 's chapel is small , so Roberts raised money for a large " Spiritual Life Center " that he said will make it easier to put on " wholesome entertainment , like gospel concerts . " Fundraising efforts included the sales of his wife 's " mop angels " ( do n't laugh  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a civilian-attended prison slumber party . Roberts said he did n't plan to undertake similar efforts to restore the drug-abuse or education programs cut this year or to subsidize the $150 that regular inmates must pay for computer training . <p> Cheeseburgers are n't the most substantial way Kansas ' inmates fund perks for their born-again brethren . Although some state legislatures allocate money for InnerChange ( Texas recently set aside $1.5 million ) , Kansas provides it with only about $200,000 out of the Inmate Benefit Fund ( profits from prison canteens and exorbitant phone rates ) . Kansas ' $4.3 million Inmate Benefit Fund typically buys library books and sports equipment , but Roger Werholtz , secretary of the Department of Corrections , said InnerChange is a fair allocation because it is voluntary and open to everyone . " Not everyone uses the basketball hoops , " he added . <p> In Kansas , the Inmate Benefit Fund covers only about 40 percent of InnerChange 's cost ; PFM pays the rest , making it attractive to government officials not swayed by the promise of kingdom-building alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participates in a regular group-therapy program ; InnerChange therapy costs the state only $1,086 per inmate . What 's more , the state saves money when inmates fulfill their requirements for vocational training or substance-abuse counseling through InnerChange . " I know we do n't have any good long-term numbers on recidivism with the program , " said Werholtz , " but I was willing to suspend judgment because it follows the form , if not the content , of a therapeutic program . I 'm interested in any kind of resources we can employ that will be effective on a low-cost or no-cost basis . " <p> Werholtz says , " If you turn down the volume , InnerChange looks like a therapeutic community program . " He is right . In their biblically based therapy sessions , InnerChange inmates break into tears and hugs with a frequency that would exhaust Oprah . These are n't crocodile tears . Many men are reconciled with estranged family members ; all can talk about whatever suffering , neglect , or poverty landed them in prison . <p> But lest anyone mistake an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in a handy page-long chart . For instance , while standard therapy " seeks gradual change of self , " the transformation that InnerChange promises " happens through an instantaneous miracle . " <p> InnerChange 's substance-abuse program is state accredited , although unlike in the regular state program , addiction is n't presented as a disease to be struggled with for life , but as a sin that can be permanently " cured " through Jesus . This is typical of the faith-based substance-abuse programs , like Teen Challenge , that President Bush ardently supports . As governor , Bush defended Teen Challenge against charges that it violated state and health-department codes , saying , " I believe that conversion to religion , in this case Christianity , by its very nature promotes sobriety . " <p> At Ellsworth , InnerChange staff use Teen Challenge materials whether or not inmates have a substance-abuse problem . " It 's all about discipleship , " program manager Larry Furnish explains . " The addiction part is just one component of the materials . " <p> InnerChange is also eager to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pastor Raymond does n't think it would be that hard to develop . " It 's all sin , " he said , shrugging . Jerry Wilger , head of InnerChange , said the idea is currently under consideration . <p> I GOT A TASTE OF WHAT a faith-based sex-offender program might look like when I attended an InnerChange support group that Furnish said was % little like AA for homosexuals . " The group was led by Clint Price , 28 , who Furnish said " had a reputation across the state for being a flaming homosexual , " while the other two members were " former cross-dressers . " <p> Serving out a sentence for burglary , Price showed me pictures of his pre-InnerChange days when he plucked his eyebrows and had long hair . " At one point , I had the Bloods and the Crips fighting over me , " he said with a trace of pride . <p> Price joined InnerChange because he had " some bad relationships and got let down and hurt so much . I was sick of competing with other queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just not faithful and I was taking a lot of abuse . " At InnerChange , Price was encouraged to grow out his facial hair , lift weights , stop shaving his legs , and abandon " the lifestyle . " The group Price leads  --  InnerChange plans to have him minister to those " in the lifestyle " when he 's released  --  is supposed to affect a similar change in the others . <p> I entered the InnerChange library unattended by any guard or staff . Sitting in the darkened room with Price 's group as he read evangelical texts on homosexuality off a slide projector in a Ben Stein monotone  --  " Start your life moving . " Click . " In a new direction towards complete manhood . " Click  --  was a profoundly unsettling experience . It quickly became clear that the other members , Terry Hoffman and James Gavin , were not simply " cross-dressers " but serious sex offenders ; Hoffman said he 'd attempted to sodomize a blind man , and Gavin had sodomized his four-year-old daughter . Hoffman attended InnerChange because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Gavin had completed . As Price shared the trials of growing up gay , Asian , and uncoordinated in " a town smaller than Ellsworth , where sports are everything , " it was clear he was out of his depth . <p> Privately , Price acknowledged that he 's " really not for sure on how to deal with someone who has a sex crime . Some of the things they bring up from their past  --  real , real dysfunctional things  --  go beyond my experience , " he said uneasily . " I do n't know what to say , so I just have us pray together . " <p> Letting Christ-based programs " cure " sex offenders  --  exempting them from state programs that employ aversion therapy and normative counseling , and releasing them into society armed primarily with polemics about sin  --  seems risky , to say the least , but Furnish is confident the state will go for it . " We already offer GED , substance-abuse , and pre-release programs . <p> If we get sex-offender treatment , we 'll have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , " he said . <p> INNERCHANGE is the sort of program President Bush is promoting with faith-based initiatives , appointments , executive orders , and ( so far failed ) legislative attempts . The director of the White House Office for Faith-Based Initiatives says Bush has asked Attorney General John Ashcroft to investigate using InnerChange in federal prisons . Former PFM officials also lead Dare Mighty Things , which , thanks to a $2.2 million grant by the Department of Health and Human Services , now serves as a clearinghouse for faith-based and community groups applying for federal money . <p> It was already possible for faith groups to receive government funding to work in prisons ; they simply have to separate their charity from their sermons and are forbidden to proselytize . But Bush 's faith-based initiatives promote a very different theology of social action  --  one that he and Colson have personally experienced  --  that claims religion itself is the cure for social ills . PFM can receive state funds because InnerChange members enroll voluntarily , though it 's hard to see the program as entirely voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick . Furthermore , lifers who graduate from the InnerChange " God pod " return to cellblocks as " disciples " and are encouraged to proselytize . <p> Bush 's faith-based initiatives are also part of a larger effort to privatize social services . As Robert Boston , a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State , says , " This is really about making dramatic changes in the structure of the social safety net . " Boston 's group is suing InnerChange in an effort to challenge faith-based initiatives on constitutional grounds . <p> Colson , in a recent radio address , said , " What 's at stake in the suit is not just a prison program , but how we deal with social problems in our country . Do we do it through grassroots organizations or big government ? We know what works . " <p> In fact , there 's no conclusive research about whether the treatments InnerChange is experimenting with do work . The Texas Freedom Network recently reported on how Bush 's faith-based initiatives have fared in that state , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at deregulated faith-based child-care centers and alcohol-treatment programs . Data compiled by Texas ' Criminal Justice Policy Council suggests InnerChange graduates have lower rates of recidivism . But as University of Arizona sociologist Mark Chaves notes , " Prison Fellowship claims amazing success rates , but in prisons where it exists , it 's often the only rehab program . We do n't have comparisons between PFM and secular programs ; we have comparisons between PFM and nothing . " <p> Faith-based programs have a synergetic relationship with government cutbacks ; InnerChange derives its transformational force from the stark neediness of inmates . It 's hard  --  even for Muslim inmates like Patterson  --  to be overly critical of InnerChange , because the services its inmates receive are such an improvement on what is offered in regular prison . Amy Fettig of the ACLU National Prison Project says InnerChange is " potentially problematic , " but " we have n't had any complaints from inmates . It may be that folks are just desperate to get any services with states cutting back their budgets so much . " Meanwhile , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like deprivation of food , crowding , and violence . " <p> THOSE ARE SOME of the conditions that Rodney Woods , 31 , said drove him to enroll in InnerChange . Previously , Woods was serving time in the Hutchinson , Kansas , maximum-security prison , where he shared a cell with four other men and was let out to exercise for an hour a day . <p> Woods , who has wide almond eyes and rows of neat braids knotted behind his ears , said he was angry all the time , frustrated , and scared of what he might do . " My home-boy got jumped and I knew when he got out of the hole we were going to take care of it . I was going to end up fighting , kill the guy if need be . I was going to do something I was gon na regret . " When Raymond came to speak at Hutchinson about the faith-based prison wing , Woods said , " I was attracted to the aspect of change . I wanted to be around positive people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Black Muslim sect and said he was n't interested in finding Jesus . " All I knew , " he said , rolling his WWJD neck chain around his index finger , " is I had to get out of Hutch . " <p> By enrolling in a Christ-based program , inmates at Kansas ' Ellsworth prison can receive the Spirit  --  and a host of prison and parole benefits . <p> Pastor Don Raymond believes that inmates can overcome addiction , violent tendencies , and sexual predilections  --  all by embracing Jesus Christ . <p> John Thomas leads other inmates at Ellsworth in Bible study class . <p> Warden Ray Roberts would like to see InnerChange run his entire prison . <p> Inmate Clint Price ( top right ) , who leads a support group , and InnerChange 's Larry Furnish ( above , far right ) see Christ as the ticket to rehabilitation . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Samantha M.
