Flesh and Blood // On a bleak twenty-fifth day of November in 1835 , a quixotic clan gathered in the one-room ground floor of a weaver 's cottage in Dunfermline , Scotland , to await the arrival of its newest member . That day , Andrew Carnegie-or Andra as his relatives would call him-was born into a large family of political activists , radicals , and eccentrics . These blood relations , with all their passions and idiosyncrasies , would inspire and haunt Andra ; they would infuse him with proletarian social and political convictions that would create merciless internal conflict as he came to embody the quintessential American rags-to-riches story . // The first in the family tree on record to protest the British monarchy and the oppressive living conditions suffered by the working class was James Carnegie , Andra 's great-grandfather , who was of Celtic blood . A shadowy figure in family lore , James had settled in Pattiemuir , just north of Edinburgh , where he leased land for farming and took up weaving . The village encompassed about a dozen cottages with red-tiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meal Riots of 1770 , which followed a bad harvest , he was arrested for sedition against the local gentry who controlled the land and bore the blame for the food shortages . While he was in prison , a mysterious lady visited him and gave him a jewel-encrusted snuffbox , which prompted rumors that the Carnegie lineage was of a more exulted rank than mere peasant weaver . The earls of Northesk and of Southesk both bore the name Carnegie , but the family proudly denied any connection . Although James escaped conviction and quietly returned to his family , the name Carnegie , a Gaelic compound word meaning " fort at the gap , " would be forever associated with the radical element . // James 's oldest son and Andra 's grandfather , Andrew Carnegie , was more of an eccentric than a radical . Also a natural leader , he was more blithe than his father and lived by the Scottish proverb " Be happy while you 're living , for you 're a long time dead " -a trait he bequeathed to Andra , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ability to shed trouble and to laugh through life , making ' all my ducks swans , ' as friends say I do , must have been inherited from this delightful old masquerading grandfather whose name I am proud to bear . " Grandfather Carnegie relished consorting with the hamlet 's men either at the smithy or the Black Bull Inn . In order to instigate political and social debate , he founded Pattiemuir College , which was no more than a single-room cottage in the village center were the men gathered weekly to argue over the important issues of the day . Grandfather Carnegie was dubbed the Professor , as were most of his cohorts , and considering that the so-called professors far outnumbered the students , whispers in town that rumored the college to be " a drinking place " were not unfounded . // To initiate the meetings , Grandfather Carnegie would climb upon his throne and , lifting his dram of malt whiskey , toast the common man 's king of poets , Robert " Rabbie " Burns , or some other Scottish icon . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public and private drinking , the ability to imbibe , otherwise known as " quaffing the goblet " or " chasing the rosy hours , " said a good deal about a man , and these men had much to say . After a benedictory toast , he would instigate heated debate by reading the news from either the London Times or the Edinburgh Scotsman . Topics ranged from theological matters to corruption in Parliament to factory reform . Regardless of the issue , whether national or foreign , Professor Andrew proved to be the expert . He was celebrated for his power of persuasion , his passion for debate , his skilled storytelling , his devotion to democratic ideals , and his righteous indignation ( particularly true after a few drams at the college ) - all traits that later manifested themselves in Andra , who would become renowned for his grandiloquence and derive exceptional pleasure from startling people with his wild stories and radical ideals . // As a second-generation weaver , Grandpa Carnegie accompanied his father , James , to cities such as Dunfermline and Edinburgh to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal town of Limekilns , he became smitten with Elizabeth Thom , the daughter of a customer . Their courtship began in earnest , but there was a major obstacle : Elizabeth 's wealthy father , a sea captain and shipowner , wanted his precious daughter to have nothing to do with a village weaver who offered no sign of being " specially successful in the acquisition of worldly gear . " ( Here the characters of Grandpa Carnegie and his namesake Andra diverged completely ; Andra would prove himself a prodigal capitalist . ) Despite the wizened captain withdrawing Elizabeth 's dowry , she and Andrew married for love , eventually producing ten children . // Andrew and Elizabeth 's seventh child was William , born on June 19 , 1804 , the future father of the world 's most rapacious steel master . The flaxen-haired boy with blue eyes bright against his milk-pale skin became a third-generation weaver and eventually specialized in damask , a craft involving the use of a lustrous fabric such as cotton , linen , or silk to create flat patterns in a satin weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced spectacular tablecloths as his feet worked the treadles and his hands deftly moved the shuttle from side to side . At that time , Dunfermline , two miles north , was the center for the damask trade . William , realizing an independent life in Pattiemuir would put few shillings in his pocket , journeyed there circa 1830 , his father to follow . It was a brave act moving from a mere hamlet to a burgh of more than ten thousand people , but William was young and ambitious . // Nicknamed " Auld Grey Toun " because all the buildings were constructed of gray sandstone , the seemingly dour Dunfermline nevertheless had a certain romantic lure that pervaded the inhabitants ' spirits , including that of Andra . It stood on high ground overlooking the Firth of Forth , a long , narrow bay backed by the silhouette of the Pentland Hills beyond , and had once been the capital of Scotland . Rich with tradition and treasure , at the start of the fourteenth century Dunfermline 's " Abbey and Monastery buildings stood unrivalled in Scotland for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town historian Ebenezer Henderson . On his death in 1329 , King Robert the Bruce was buried in the center of the abbey , surrounded by past kings and queens , including Queen Margaret , the patron saint of Scotland . But in the mid-1400s , the capital was relocated to Edinburgh , a far more powerful military seat , with its imposing fortress and ability to protect the royal family . When William Carnegie made his way to Dunfermline , the majestic monastery and royal palace were but ruins , though the air of nobility and pride remained , the noble ghosts of William Wallace and the Robert the Bruce alive in the streets . // William rented half of a cottage duplex on the corner of Moodie Street and Priory Lane , paying between $15 and $20 a year . He set up his loom on the main floor , the room 's dimensions a mere eight paces by six , and his living quarters in the cramped attic above . He shared the stairs with the other renters , along with the privy out back . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Dunfermline the damask handloom weaver was considered aristocracy , the nobility of the working class and relatively prosperous , in stark contrast to the suffering tenant farmers , coal miners , and factory workers who were paid starvation wages . // Recognized as a sober and skilled weaver , William Carnegie quickly made friends , including the Morrison family , who lived up the street . He became smitten with Margaret Morrison , who was born on June 19 , 1810 , the third of six children . Her father , Thomas , was a political activist , reminding William of his own radical heritage . Like all Morrison women , Margaret had a stout body and strong , dark facial features , her square chin and high cheekbones prominent in what was otherwise a plain face . As a polite Scotsman would say , she was a " wiselik " girl , or " She 's better than she 's bonny . " In other words , she was a woman with character . Considering her mother died when Margaret was just four , she had little choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with heavy , almost seductive lids that first captivated William . No fool , he recognized an efficient woman of good stock , and in December 1834 he took her hand in marriage . Although Andra was named after his paternal grandfather and had his father 's blond hair and blue eyes , he would inherit his mother 's resoluteness and tenacity , as well as the fiercely independent fighting spirit of his maternal ancestors . // The bellicose Morrison spirit was due to their Norse blood , their Viking ancestors having invaded northern Scotland and conquered the people there in the ninth and tenth centuries . They then migrated south . Some seven hundred years later found Thomas Morrison 's father , John , to be a prosperous leather merchant in Edinburgh . Thomas married Ann Hodge , the daughter of a wealthy Edinburgh merchant , and was running the family 's leather business when , according to family legend , he made some speculative investments and lost both the business and his wife 's inheritance . He moved the family to Dunfermline to begin anew , to rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade he had learned as a boy . // Although a widower since 1814 , Thomas found the time to pursue political activities , and derived great satisfaction in haranguing audiences about his favorite topic , land reform . It was time for the monarchy , the lords , and the privileged few to relinquish the land they had controlled since the beginning of the feudal system . In one torrid lecture , " Rights of Land , " he delivered his core doctrine : " Our rule is Each shall possess ; all shall enjoy ; Our principle , universal and equal right ; and our ' law of the land ' shall be Every man a lord ; every woman a lady ; and every child an heir . " His brooding black eyes would stare out at the crowd , and his wild outcropping of sable hair would shake as he gestured wildly with each point he shouted , his strong jaw jutting outward . His extravagant use of body language-a thrown-out chest , rollicking lips , violent hand motions-were so identically reproduced in Andra that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were embraced by the entire clan , including Andra , who came to despise inherited privilege and aristocratic tendencies in any form . // To further his political agenda , Morrison organized a Dunfermline political union of fellow radicals in the 1820s , which had the adopted battle cry " Agitation is the order of the day-the night of monastic ignorance is passed . " He also founded The Precursor , a newspaper " devoted to the interests of the Tradesmen and Mechanics in particular , " but it was considered so provocative that only a radical printer in Edinburgh would set it in type . Whether it was a readership too timid to buy the paper or the cost of sending each manuscript the sixteen miles to Edinburgh via horse-drawn carriage , the newspaper was declared defunct after just three issues . Enthusiasm unabated , Morrison took up his pen against the district 's representative to Parliament , the Tory nobleman Lord Dalmeny , and in an audacious stream of correspondence he advised and criticized Dalmeny on everything from his support of the monarchy to his grammar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died on the road in 1837 , haranguing the public and collecting money to continue his mission . // There was good cause for Morrison 's land reform agitation , as well as the general desire for revolution that pervaded Britain 's working class : the country 's deteriorating economic and living conditions had become unbearable . While Andra was yet too young to comprehend his immediate world , he was a creature of his environment , and these threads of history would be woven into the fabric of his soul . Social conditions , now and in the future , would shape his moral convictions . // No longer ignorant , voiceless peasants taking swipes at the monarchy by poaching deer on the nobility 's properties , the members of the disenfranchised working class were becoming more vocal , organizing themselves into trade unions , demanding reduced work hours and reasonable wages , and their leaders were inserting themselves into the political fray . Several issues in particular stirred the public 's ire , but , foremost , the middle and lower classes demanded the seemingly basic rights to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own property . Another thorn was the Corn Laws , which artificially supported the price of corn and wheat to benefit the farmers . The majority of the working class , however , lived in factory and mining towns where they could n't grow their own food and were forced to pay the artificially inflated prices or face starvation . It became difficult to earn a living wage and conditions continued to deteriorate , a situation described so depressingly well by Charles Dickens in such classics as Oliver Twist ( 1838 ) . These problems were not just political ; they were also the side effects of the Industrial Revolution , a revolution that was beyond the control of politicians . // Great Britain had taken an early lead in the Industrial Revolution . The isles , with rich coalfields to provide fuel for steam engines , many natural waterways for cheap transportation , and a booming international trade with its colonies , was ideally suited for a transformation from an agricultural-based economy to a manufacturing-based economy , from a handicraft system to a factory system . As country folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities in increasing numbers , the transition proved painful because already poor living conditions in urban centers were exacerbated by a population explosion . Contributing to this unprecedented growth were the Irish , who , seeking work , arrived in waves . Thus , employers had such a large labor pool to select from that they were able to dictate low wages and long hours , further suppressing the working poor . Disillusioned and embittered , the working class formed both trade and political unions to exert pressure , and activism increased dramatically . // Nationalistic-minded Scotland raised a collective cry of protest as industrial towns such as Dunfermline , Glasgow , and the mining towns that sprang up around the expansive central coalfields suffered more than most . The police superintendent of Glasgow , reporting on his own city streets , observed , " There is concentrated everything that is wretched , dissolute , loathsome , and pestilential. //
