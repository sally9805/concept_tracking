In 1627 , the great German astronomer Johannes Kepler first predicted a transit of Venus , but he died before he could witness the 1631 event . In 1769 , the explorer Captain James Cook-just a lieutenant at the time-made his first voyage to the South Pacific in order to view that year 's transit from Tahiti . And more than 50 expeditions were launched from the U.S. , Britain , Russia and other nations to every corner of the earth to see the 1874 transit . <P> There was an important reason to make such efforts : by recording the moments a transit began and ended from different vantage points on Earth , astronomers could use trigonometry to precisely calculate the distance from Earth to the sun . That was easier in theory than in practice , though , and nowadays astronomers use other methods to measure the distance to the sun . The world will be watching next month , but mostly out of curiosity and wonder at seeing a planet move across the face of the sun-firsthand proof that the seemingly two dimensional sky is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 . If you miss that one , you 're out of luck . There wo n't be another transit until 2117 . <P> Best seats in the house The transit takes only about six hours . The U.S. has a partial view ; the West Coast misses it because it happens there at night . <P> U.S. As the sun rises , New England sees Venus two-thirds of the way through its passage . As you head south and west , less and less of the transit is visible . <P> WORLD Europe and most of Africa and Asia are ideal for viewing <P> TRIP PAST THE SUN Venus passes between Earth and the sun more than once a year on average , but because its orbit is tilted with respect to Earth 's , a lineup precise enough to permit a transit is much rarer . <P> VENUS Its size and composition make it almost a twin of Earth , but its atmosphere is so thick that pressure at the surface is 90 times that on Earth . The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide flavored with sulfur and sulfuric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result : temperatures of more than 800F ( 430C ) . <P> VENUS 'S TRANSIT <P> June 8 <P> 1 A.M. ( E.T. ) 2 A.M. 3 A.M. 4 A.M. 5 A.M. 6 A.M. 7 A.M. 8 A.M. <P> How to view the transit safely <P> DO NOT WATCH THIS EVENT WITHOUT ADEQUATE EYE PROTECTION The sun may look dim through sunglasses , unexposed photographic film and CDs , but it can cause permanent blindness . The only safe way to look at the transit is through No. 14 welder 's glasses or a Mylar filter certified for sun observation ( some manufacturers have made such filters into goggles ) . If you are n't absolutely sure that 's what you 've got , you can avoid frying your retinas by making a pinhole projector , right , and watching indirectly . <P> Source :
