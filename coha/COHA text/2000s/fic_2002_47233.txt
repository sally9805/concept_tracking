Okay , do n't believe your editor . No one will blame you . But there are papers and documents to prove it , a contract dated October 2000 , a check , e-mail correspondence . Fact is , the following story was written before November 7,2000 . Of course you do n't believe it , in spite of the evidence . No one blames you . But it 's true . Dale Bailey reports that his first novel , Giants in the Earth , is slated for publication in the spring of 2003 . He has also contracted for a story collection , The Resurrection Man 's Legacy and Other Stories , to be published around the same time . We have chosen not to ask him how he voted ( or how often ! ) after writing this far-fetched tale . <p> IT 'S FUNNY HOW THINGS happen , Burton used to tell me . The very moment you 're engaged in some task of mind-numbing insignificance - cutting your toenails , maybe , or fishing in the sofa for the remote - the world is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush your teeth , and halfway around the planet flood waters are on the rise . Every minute of every day , the world transforms itself in ways you can hardly imagine , and there you are , sitting in traffic or wondering what 's for lunch or just staring blithely out a window . History happens while you 're making other plans , Burton always says . I guess I know that now . I guess we all know that . Me , I was in a sixth-floor Chicago office suite working on my resume when it started . The usual chaos swirled around me - phones braying , people scurrying about , the televisions singing exit poll data over the din - but it all had a forced artificial quality . The campaign was over . Our numbers people had told us everything we needed to know : when the polls opened that morning , Stoddard was up seventeen points . So there I sat , dejected and soon to be unemployed , with my feet on a rented desk and my laptop propped against my knees , mulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fifteen . As in directed public relations for the Democratic National Committee . As in directed a national political campaign straight into the toilet . Then CNN started emitting the little overture that means somewhere in the world history is happening , just like Burton always says . I looked up as Lewis turned off the television . " What 'd you do that for ? " Lewis leaned over to shut my computer down . " I 'll show you , " he said . I followed him through the suite , past clumps of people huddled around televisions . Nobody looked my way . Nobody had looked me in the eye since Sunday . I tried to listen , but over the shocked buzz in the room I could n't catch much more than snatches of unscripted anchor-speak . I did n't see Burton , and I supposed he was off drafting his concession speech . " No sense delaying the inevitable , " he had told me that morning . " What gives ? " I said to Lewis in the hall , but he only shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the drooping posture and hangdog expression of an adolescent . He stood in the elevator and watched the numbers cycle , rubbing idly at an acne scar . He had lots of them , a whole face pitted from what had to be among the worst teenage years in human history . I had never liked him much , and I liked him even less right then , but you could n't help admiring the intelligence in his eyes . If Burton had been elected , Lewis would have served him well . Now he 'd be looking for work instead . The doors slid apart , and Lewis steered me through the lobby into a typical November morning in Chicago : a diamond-tipped wind boring in from the lake , a bruised sky spitting something that could n't decide whether it wanted to be rain or snow . I grew up in Southern California my grandparents raised me - and there 's not much I hate more than Chicago weather ; but that morning I stood there with my shirtsleeves rolled to the elbow and my tie whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " My God , " I said , and for a moment , my mind just locked up . All I could think was that not two hours ago I had stood in this very spot watching Burton work the crowd , and then the world had still been sane . Afterward , Burton had walked down the street to cast his ballot . When he stepped out of the booth , the press had been waiting . Burton charmed them , the consummate politician even in defeat . We could have done great things . And even then the world had still been sane . No longer . It took me a moment to sort it all out - the pedestrians shouldering by with wild eyes , the bellhop standing dumbfounded before the hotel on the corner , his chin bobbing at half-mast . Three taxis had tangled up in the street , bleeding steam , and farther up the block loomed an overturned bus the size of a beached plesiosaur . Somewhere a woman was screaming atonally , over and over and over , with staccato hitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV crew was getting it all on tape , and for the first time since I blew Burton 's chance to hold the highest office in the land , I stood in the presence of a journalist who was n't shoving a mike in my face to ask me what had come over me . I was too stunned even to enjoy it . Instead , like Lewis beside me , I just stared across the street at the polling place . Dead people had gathered there , fifteen or twenty of them , and more arriving . Even then , there was never any question in my mind that they were dead . You could see it in the way they held their bodies , stiff as marionettes ; in their shuffling gaits and the bright haunted glaze of their eyes . You could see it in the lacerations yawning open on the ropy coils of their guts , in their random nakedness , their haphazard clothes hospital gowns and blood-stained blue jeans and immaculate suits fresh from unsealed caskets . You could see it in the dark patches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that they were dead . It was every zombie movie you ever saw , and then some . Goose flesh erupted along my arms , and it had nothing to do with the wind off Lake Michigan . " My God , " I said again , when I finally managed to unlock my brain . " What do they want ? " " They want to vote , " said Lewis . The dead have been voting in Chicago elections since long before Richard J. Daley took office , one wag wrote in the next morning 's Tribune , but yesterday 's events bring a whole new meaning to the tradition . I 'll say . The dead had voted , all right , and not just in Chicago . They had risen from hospital gurneys and autopsy slabs , from open coffins and embalming tables in every precinct in the nation , and they had cast their ballots largely without interference . Who was going to stop them ? More than half the poll-workers had abandoned ship when the zombies started shambling through the doors , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do as they pleased . The dead did n't threaten anyone they did n't do much of anything you 'd expect zombies-to do , in fact . But most people found that inscrutable gaze unnerving . Better to let them cast their ballots than bear for long the knowing light in those strange eyes . And when the ballots were counted , we learned something else as well : They voted for Burton . Every last one of them voted for Burton . " It 's your fault , " Lewis said at breakfast the next day . Everyone else agreed with him , I could tell , the entire senior staff , harried and sleep-deprived . They studied their food as he ranted , or scrutinized the conference table or scribbled frantic notes in their dayplanners . Anything to avoid looking me in the eye . Even Burton , alone at the head of the table , just munched on a bagel and stared at CNN , the muted screen aflicker with footage of zombies staggering along on their unfathomable errands . Toward dawn , as the final tallies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gravitate toward cemeteries . No one yet knew why . " My fault ? " I said , but my indignation was manufactured . About five that morning , waking from nightmare in my darkened hotel room , I had arrived at the same conclusion as everyone else . " The goddamn talk show , " Lewis said , as if that explained everything . And maybe it did . The goddamn talk show in question was none other than Crossfire , and the Sunday before the polls opened I got caught in it . I had broken the first commandment of political life , a commandment I had flogged relentlessly for the last year . Stay on message , stick to the talking points . Thou shalt not speak from the heart . The occasion of this amateurish mistake was a six-year-old girl named Dana Maguire . Three days before I went on the air , a five-year-old boy gunned Dana down in her after-school program . The kid had found the pistol in his father 's night stand , and just as Dana 's mother was coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulated lunch sack and shot Dana in the neck . She died in her mother 's arms while the five-year-old looked on in tears . Just your typical day in America , except the first time I saw Dana 's photo in the news , I felt something kick a hole in my chest . I can remember the moment to this day : October light slanting through hotel windows , the television on low while I talked to my grandmother in California . I do n't have much in the way of family . There had been an uncle on my father 's side , but he had drifted out of my life after my folks died , leaving my mother 's parents to raise me . There 's just the two of us since my grandfather passed on five years ago , and even in the heat of a campaign , I try to check on Gran every day . Mostly she rattles on about old folks in the home , a litany of names and ailments I can barely keep straight at the best of times . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-up in front of Little Tykes Academy , I lost the thread of her words altogether . Next thing I know , she 's saying , " Robert , Robert - " in this troubled voice , and me , I 'm sitting on a hotel bed in Dayton , Ohio , weeping for a little girl I never heard of . Grief , shock , you name it - ten years in public life , nothing like that had ever happened to me before . But after that , I could n't think of it in political terms . After that , Dana Maguire was personal . Predictably , the whole thing came up on Cross fire . Joe Stem , Stoddard 's campaign director and a man I 've known for years , leaned into the camera and espoused the usual line - you know , the one about the constitutional right to bear arms , as if Jefferson had personally foreseen the rapid-fire semi-automatic with a sixteen-round clip . Coming from the mouth of Joe Stem , a smug fleshy ideologue who ought to have known better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized the voice that responded to him . I felt as though something else was speaking through me - as though a voice had possessed me , a speaker from that broken hole in the center of my chest . What it said , that voice , was : " If Grant Burton is elected , he 'll see that every handgun in the United States is melted into pig iron . He 'll do everything in his power to save the Dana Maguires of this nation . " Joe Stern puffed up like a toad . " This is n't about Dana Maguire The voice interrupted him . " If there 's any justice in the universe , Dana Maguire will rise up from her grave to haunt you , " the voice said . It said , " If it 's not about Dana Maguire , then what on Earth is it about ? " Stoddard had new ads in saturation before the day was out : Burton 's face , my words in voice-over . If Grant Burton is elected , he 'll see that every handgun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday afternoon , we had plummeted six points and Lewis was n't speaking to me . I could n't seem to shut him up now , though . He leaned across the table and jabbed a thick finger at me , overturning a styrofoam cup of coffee . I watched the black pool spread as he shouted . " We were up five points , we had it won before you opened your goddamn - " Angela Dey , our chief pollster , interrupted him . " Look ! " she said , pointing at the television . Burton touched the volume button on the remote , but the image on the screen was clear enough : a cemetery in upstate New York , one of the new ones where the stones are set flush to the earth to make mowing easier . Three or four zombies had fallen to their knees by a fresh grave . " Good God , " Dey whispered . " What are they doing ? " No one gave her an answer and I suppose she had n't expected one . She could see as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dead were scrabbling at the earth with their bare hands . A line from some old poem I had read in college ahh , who 's digging on my grave lodged in my head , rattling around like angry candy , and for the first time I had a taste of the hysteria that would possess us all by the time this was done . Graves had opened , the dead walked the Earth . All humanity trembled . Ahh , who 's digging on my grave ? Lewis flung himself back against his chair and glared at me balefully . " This is all your fault . " " At least they voted for us , " I said . Not that we swept into the White House at the head of a triumphal procession of zombies . Anything but , actually . The voting rights of the dead turned out to be a serious constitutional question , and Stoddard lodged a complaint with the Federal Election Commission . Dead people had no say in the affairs of the living , he argued , and besides , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic National Committee counter-sued , claiming that the sheer presence of the dead may have kept legitimate voters from the polls . While the courts pondered these issues in silence , the world convulsed . Church attendance soared . The president impaneled experts and blue-ribbon commissions , the Senate held hearings . The CDC convened a task force to search for biological agents . At the UN , the Security Council debated a quarantine against the United States ; the stock market lost fifteen percent on the news . Meanwhile , the dead went unheeding about their business . They never spoke or otherwise attempted to communicate , yet you could sense an intelligence , inhuman and remote , behind their mass resurrection . They spent the next weeks opening fresh graves , releasing the recently buried from entombment . With bare hands , they clawed away the dirt ; through sheer numbers , they battered apart the concrete vaults and sealed caskets . You would see them in the streets , stinking of formaldehyde and putrefaction , their hands torn and ragged , the rich earth of the grave impacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they did n't stay dead ; the newly resurrected kept busy at their graves . A week after the balloting , the Supreme Court handed down a decision overturning the election . Congress , meeting in emergency session , set a new date for the first week of January . If nothing else , the year 2000 debacle in Florida had taught us the virtue of speed . Lewis came to my hotel room at dusk to tell me . " We 're in business , " he said . When I did n't answer , he took a chair across from me . We stared over the fog-shrouded city in silence . Far out above the lake , threads of rain seamed the sky . Good news for the dead . The digging would go easier . Lewis turned the bottle on the table so he could read the label . I knew what it was : Glenfiddich , a good single malt . I 'd been sipping it from a hotel tumbler most of the afternoon . " Why " nt you turn on some lights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark . " Lewis grunted . After a moment , he fetched the other glass . He wiped it out with his handkerchief and poured . " So tell me . " Lewis tilted his glass , grimaced . " January fourth . The president signed the bill twenty minutes ago . Protective cordons fifty yards from polling stations . Only the living can vote . Jesus . I ca n't believe I 'm even saying that . " He cradled his long face in his hands . " So you in ? " " Does he want me ? " " Yes . " " What about you , Lewis ? Do you want me ? " Lewis said nothing . We just sat there , breathing in the woodsy aroma of the scotch , watching night bleed into the sky . " You screwed me at staff meeting the other day , " I said . " You hung me out to dry in front of everyone . It wo n't work if you keep cutting the ground out from under my feet . " " Goddamnit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed everything we 've worked for . We had it won . " " Oh come on , Lewis . If Crossfire never happened , it could have gone either way . Five points , that 's nothing . We were barely outside the plus and minus , you know that . " " Still . Why 'd you have to say that ? " I thought about that strange sense I 'd had at the time : another voice speaking through me . Mouthpiece of the dead . " You ever think about that little girl , Lewis ? " He sighed . " Yeah . Yeah , I do . " He lifted his glass . " Look . If you 're angling for some kind of apology " I do n't want an apology . " " Good , " he said . Then , grudgingly : " We need you on this one , Rob . You know that . " " January , " I said . " That gives us almost two months . " " We 're way up right now . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah . " Lewis touched his face . It was dark , but I could sense the gesture . He 'd be fingering his acne scars , I 'd spent enough time with him to know that . " I do n't know , though , " he said . " I think the right might sit this one out . They think it 's the fuckin " Rapture , who 's got time for politics ? " " We 'll see . " He took the rest of his scotch in a gulp and stood . " Yeah . We 'll see . " I did n't move as he showed himself out , just watched his reflection in the big plate glass window . He opened the door and turned to look back , a tall man framed in light from the hall , his face lost in shadow . " Rob ? " " Yeah ? " " You all right ? " I drained my glass and swished the scotch around in my mouth . I 'm having a little trouble sleeping these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all I said was , " I 'm fine , Lewis . I 'm just fine . " I WAS N'T , though , not really . None of us were , I guess , but even now - maybe especially now - the thing I remember most about those first weeks is how little the resurrection of the dead altered our everyday lives . Isolated incidents made the news - I remember a serial killer being arrested as his victims heaved themselves bodily from their shallow backyard graves - but mostly people just carried on . After the initial shock , markets stabilized . Stores filled up with Thanksgiving turkeys ; radio stations began counting the shopping days until Christmas . Yet I think the hysteria must have been there all along , like a swift current just beneath the surface of a placid lake . An undertow , the kind of current that 'll kill you if you 're not careful . Most people looked okay , but scratch the surface and we were all going nuts in a thousand quiet ways . Ahh , who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't sleep . The stress of the campaign had been mounting steadily even before my meltdown on Cross fire , and in those closing days , with the polls in California - and all those lovely delegates - a hair too close to call , I 'd been waking grainy-eyed and yawning every morning . I was feeling guilty , too . Three years ago , Gran broke her hip and landed in a Long Beach nursing home . And while I talked to her daily , I could never manage to steal a day or two to see her , despite all the time we spent campaigning in California . But the resurrection of the dead marked a new era in my insomnia . Stumbling to bed late on election night , my mind blistered with images of zombies in the streets , I fell into a fevered dream . I found myself wandering through an abandoned city . Everything burned with the tenebrous significance of dreams - every brick and stone , the scraps of newsprint tumbling down high-rise canyons , the darkness pooling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was the sound , the lone sound in all that sea of silence : the obscurely terrible cadence of a faraway clock , impossibly magnified , echoing down empty alleys and forsaken avenues . The air rang with it , haunting me , drawing me on at last into a district where the buildings loomed over steep , close streets , admitting only a narrow wedge of sky . An open door beckoned , a black slot in a high , thin house . I pushed open the gate , climbed the broken stairs , paused in the threshold . A colossal grandfather clock towered within , its hands poised a minute short of midnight . Transfixed , I watched the heavy pendulum sweep through its arc , driving home the hour . The massive hands stood upright . The air shattered around me . The very stones shook as the clock began to toll . Clapping my hands over my ears , I turned to flee , but there was nowhere to go . In the yard , in the street - as far as I could see - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock stroked out the hours , staring up at me with those haunted eyes , and I knew suddenly and absolutely - the way you know things in dreams - that they had come for me at last , that they had always been coming for me , for all of us , if only we had known it . I woke then , coldly afraid . The first gray light of morning slit the drapes , but I had a premonition that no dawn was coming , or at least a very different dawn from any I had ever dared imagine . Stoddard made his run with two weeks to go . December fourteenth , we 're 37,000 feet over the midwest in a leased Boeing 737 , and Angela Dey drops the new numbers on us . " Gentleman , " she says , " we 've hit a little turbulence . " It was a turning point , I can see that now . At the time , though , none of us much appreciated her little joke . The resurrection of the dead had shaken things up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so - but Stoddard had been clawing his way back for a couple of weeks , crucifying us in the farm belt on a couple of ag bills where Burton cast deciding votes , hammering us in the south on vouchers . We knew that , of course , but I do n't think any of us had foreseen just how close things were becoming . " We 're up seven points in California , " Dey said . " The gay vote 's keeping our heads above water , but the numbers are soft . Stoddard 's got momentum . " " Christ , " Lewis said , but Dey was already passing around another sheet . " It gets worse , " she said . " Florida , we 're up two points . A statistical dead heat . We 've got the minorities , Stoddard has the seniors . Everything 's riding on turnout . " Libby Dixon , Burton 's press secretary , cleared her throat . " We 've got a pretty solid network among Hispanics - " Dey shook her head . " Seniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , " Lewis said . " We might as well wrap Florida up with a little bow and send it to Stoddard . " Dey handed around another sheet . She 'd orchestrated the moment for maximum impact , doling it out one sheet at a time like that . Lewis slumped in his seat , probing his scars as she worked her way through the list : Michigan , New York , Ohio , all three delegate rich , all three of them neck-and-neck races . Three almost physical blows , too , you could see them in the faces ranged around the table . " What the hell 's going on here ? " Lewis muttered as Dey passed out another sheet , and then the news out of Texas rendered even him speechless . Stoddard had us by six points . I ran through a couple of Alamo analogies before deciding that discretion was the better part of wisdom . " I thought we were gaining there , " Lewis said . Dey shrugged . I just read the numbers , I do n't make them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yeah , but Rob 's not allowed to do Crossfire anymore , " Lewis said , and a titter ran around the table . Lewis is good , I 'll give him that . You could feel the tension ease . " Suggestions ? " Burton said . Dey said , " I 've got some focus group stuff on education . I was thinking maybe some ads clarifying our - " " Hell with the ads , " someone else said , " we 've got ta spend more time in Florida . We 've got to engage Stoddard on his ground . " " Maybe a series of town meetings ? " Lewis said , and they went around like that for a while . I tried to listen , but Lewis 's little icebreaker had reminded me of the dreams . I knew where I was - 37,000 feet of dead air below me , winging my way toward a rally in Virginia - but inside my head I had n't gone anywhere at all . Inside my head , I was stuck in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the dead . The world had changed irrevocably , I thought abruptly . That seems self-evident , I suppose , but at the time it had the quality of genuine revelation . The fact is , we had all - and I mean everyone by that , the entire culture , not just the campaign - we had all been pretending that nothing much had changed . Sure , we had UN debates and a CNN feed right out of a George Romero movie , but the implications of mass resurrection - the spiritual implications - had yet to bear down upon us . We were in denial . In that moment , with the plane rolling underneath me and someone - Tyler O'Neill I think it was , Libby Dixon 's mousy assistant - droning on about going negative , I thought of something I 'd heard a professor mention back at Northwestern : Copernicus formulated the heliocentric model of the solar system in the mid-1500s , but the Church did n't get around to punishing anyone for it until they threw Galileo in jail nearly a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century trying to ignore the fact that the fundamental geography of the universe had been altered with a single stroke . And so it had again . The dead walked . Three simple words , but everything else paled beside them  --  social security , campaign finance reform , education vouchers . Everything . I wadded Dey 's sheet into a noisy ball and flung it across the table . Tyler O'Neill stuttered and choked , and for a moment everyone just stared in silence at that wad of paper . You 'd have thought I 'd hurled a hand grenade , not a two-paragraph summary of voter idiocy in the Lone Star state . Libby Dixon cleared her throat . " I hardly thin - " " Shut up , Libby , " I said . " Listen to yourselves for Christ 's sake . We got zombies in the street and you guys are worried about going negative ? " " The whole ... " Dey flapped her hand . " ... zombie thing , it 's not even on the radar . My numbers - " " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When it comes to death , sex , and money , everybody lies . A total stranger calls up on the telephone , and you expect some soccer mom to share her feelings about the fact that Grandpa 's rotten corpse is staggering around in the street ? " I had their attention all right . For a minute the plane filled up with the muted roar of the engines . No human sound at all . And then Burton - Burton smiled . " What are you thinking , Rob ? " " A great presidency is a marriage between a man and a moment , " I said . " You told me that . Remember ? " " I remember . " " This is your moment , sir . You have to stop running away from it . " " What do you have in mind ? " Lewis asked . I answered the question , but I never even looked Lewis 's way as I did it . I just held Grant Burton 's gaze . It was like no one else was there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and despite everything that 's happened since , that 's the closest I 've ever come to making history . " I want to find Dana Maguire , " I said . I 'd been in politics since my second year at Northwestern . It was nothing I ever intended - who goes off to college hoping to be a senate aide ? - but I was idealistic , and I liked the things Grant Burton stood for , so I found myself working the phones that fall as an unpaid volunteer . One thing led to another - an internship on the Hill , a post-graduate job as a research assistant - and somehow I wound up inside the beltway . I used to wonder how my life might have turned out had I chosen another path . My senior year at Northwestern , I went out with a girl named Gwen , a junior , freckled and streaky blonde , with the kind of sturdy good looks that fall a hair short of beauty . Partnered in some forgettable lab exercise , we found we had grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence , two Californians stranded in the frozen north , sustained us throughout the winter and into the spring . But we drifted in the weeks after graduation , and the last I had heard of her was a Christmas card five or six years back . I remember opening it and watching a scrap of paper slip to the floor . Her address and phone number , back home in Laguna Beach , with a little note . Call me some time , it said , but I never did . So there it was . I was thirty-two years old , I lived alone , I 'd never held a relationship together longer than eight months . Gran was my closest friend , and I saw her three times a year if I was lucky . I went to my ten-year class reunion in Evanston , and everybody there was in a different life-place than I was . They all had kids and homes and churches . Me , I had my job . Twelve-hour days , five days a week . Saturdays I spent three or four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk shows and then it was time to start all over again . That had been my routine for nearly a decade , and in all those years I never bothered to ask myself how I came to be there . It never even struck me as the kind of thing a person ought to ask . Four years ago , during Burton 's re-election campaign for the Senate , Lewis said a funny thing to me . We 're sitting in a hotel bar , drinking Miller Lite and eating peanuts , when he turns to me and says , " You got anyone , Rob ? " " Got anyone ? " " You know , a girl friend , a fiancee , somebody you care about . " Gwen flickered at the edge of my consciousness , but that was all . A flicker , nothing more . I said , " No . " " That 's good , " Lewis said . It was just the kind of thing he always said , sarcastic , a little meanhearted . Usually I let it pass , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veins to call him on it . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Lewis turned to look at me . " I was going to say , you have someone you really care about somebody you want to spend your life with - you might want to walk away from all this . " " Why 's that ? " " This job does n't leave enough room for relationships . " He finished his beer and pushed the bottle away , his gaze steady and dear . In the dim light his scars were invisible , and I saw him then as he could have been in a better world . For maybe a moment , Lewis was one step short of handsome . And then the moment broke . " Good night , " he said , and turned away . A few months after that - not long before Burton won his second sixyear Senate term - Libby Dixon told me Lewis was getting a divorce . I suppose he must have known the marriage was coming apart around him . But at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , I just sat at the bar running those words over in my mind . This job does n't leave much room for relationships , he had said , and I knew he had intended it as a warning . But what I felt instead was a bottomless sense of relief . I was perfectly content to be alone . BURTON WAS DOING an event in St. Louis when the nursing home called to say that Gran had fallen again . Eighty-one-year-old bones are fragile , and the last time I had been out there - just after the convention - Gran 's case manager had privately informed me that another fall would probably do it . " Do what ? " I had asked . The case manager looked away . She shuffled papers on her desk while her meaning bore in on me : another fall would kill her . I suppose I must have known this at some level , but to hear it articulated so baldly shook me . From the time I was four , Gran had been the single stable institution in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continent from home , when my family - my parents and sister died in the car crash . It took the state police back in Pennsylvania nearly a day to track me down . I still remember the moment : Gran 's mask-like expression as she hung up the phone , her hands cold against my face as she knelt before me . She made no sound as she wept . Tears spilled down her cheeks , leaving muddy tracks in her make-up , but she made no sound at all . " I love you , Robert , " she said . She said , " You must be strong . " That 's my first true memory . Of my parents , my sister , I remember nothing at all . I have a snapshot of them at a beach somewhere , maybe six months before I was born : my father lean and smoking , my mother smiling , her abdomen just beginning to swell . In the picture , Alice - she would have been four then - stands just in front of them , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid I used to stare at that photo , wondering how you can miss people you never even knew . I did though , an almost physical ache way down inside me , the kind of phantom pain amputees must feel . A ghost of that old pain squeezed my heart as the case manager told me about Gran 's fall . " We got lucky , " she said . " She 's going to be in a wheelchair a month or two , but she 's going to be okay . " Afterward , I talked to Gran herself , her voice thin and querulous , addled with pain killers . " Robert , " she said , " I want you to come out here . I want to see you . " " I want to see you , too , " I said , " but I ca n't get away right now . As soon as the election 's over - " " I 'm an old woman , " she told me crossly . " I may not be here after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the laugh sounded hollow even in my own ears . The words had started a grim little movie unreeling in my head - a snippet of Gran 's cold body staggering to its feet , that somehow inhuman tomb light shining out from behind its eyes . I suppose most of us must have imagined something like that during those weeks , but it unnerved me all the same . It reminded me too much of the dreams . It felt like I was there again , gazing out into the faces of the implacable dead , that enormous clock banging out the hours . " Robert - " Gran was saying , and I could hear the Demerol singing in her voice . " Are you there , Ro And for no reason at all , I said : " Did my parents have a clock , Gran ? " " A clock ? " " A grandfather clock . " She was silent so long I thought maybe she had hung up . " That was your uncle 's clock , " she said finally , her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don , " she said . " On your father 's side . " " What happened to the clock ? " " Robert , I want you to come out he - " " What happened to the clock , Gran ? " " Well , how would I know ? " she said . " He could n't keep it , could he ? I suppose he must have sold it . " " What do you mean ? " But she did n't answer . I listened to the swell and fall of Demerol sleep for a moment , and then the voice of the case manager filled my ear . " She 's drifted off . If you want , I can call back later - " I looked up as a shadow fell across me . Lewis stood in the doorway . " No , that 's okay . I 'll call her in the morning . " I hung up the phone and stared over the desk at him . He had a strange expression on his face . " What ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her ? " " They 've found her . " Eight hours later , I touched down at Logan under a cloudy midnight sky . We had hired a private security firm to find her , and one of their agents - an expressionless man with the build of an ex-athlete - met me at the gate . " You hook up with the ad people all right ? " I asked in the car , and from the way he answered , a monosyllabic " Fine , " you could tell what he thought of ad people . " The crew 's in place ? " " They 're already rigging the lights . " " How 'd you find her ? " He glanced at me , streetlight shadow rippling across his face like water . " Dead people ai n't got much imagination . Soon 's we get the fresh ones in the ground , they 're out there digging . " He laughed humorlessly . " You 'd think peopled stop burying em . " " It 's the ritual , I guess . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , we put some guys on the cemeteries and kept our eyes open , that 's all . " " Why 'd it take so long ? " For a moment there was no sound in the car but the hum of tires on pavement and somewhere far away a siren railing against the night . The agent rolled down his window and spat emphatically into the slipstream . " City the size of Boston , " he said , " it has a lot of fucking cemeteries . " The cemetery in question turned out to be everything I could have hoped for : remote and unkempt , with weathered gothic tombstones right off a Hollywood back lot . And would n't it be comforting to think so , I remember thinking as I got out of the car - the ring of lights atop the hill nothing more than stage dressing , the old world as it had been always . But it was n't , of course , and the ragged figures digging at the grave were n't actors , either . You could smell them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had begun to fall , too , and it had the feel of a genuine Boston drizzle , cold and steady toward the bleak fag end of December . Andy , the director , turned when he heard me . " Any trouble ? " I asked . " No . They do n't care much what we 're about , long as we do n't interfere . " " Good . " Andy pointed . " There she is , see ? " " Yeah , I see her . " She was on her knees in the grass , still wearing the dress she had been buried in . She dug with single-minded intensity , her arms caked with mud to the elbow , her face empty of anything remotely human . I stood and stared at her for a while , trying to decide what it was I was feeling . " You all right ? " Andy said . " What ? " " I said , are you all right ? For a second there , I thought you were crying . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the rain , that 's all . " " Right . " So I stood there and half-listened while he filled me in . He had several cameras running , multiple filters and angles , he was playing with the lights . He told me all this and none of it meant anything at all to me . None of it mattered as long as I got the footage I wanted . Until then , there was nothing for me here . He must have been thinking along the same lines , for when I turned to go , he called after me : " Say , Rob , you need n't have come out tonight , you know . " I looked back at him , the rain pasting my hair against my forehead and running down into my eyes . I shivered . " I know , " I said . A moment later , I added : " I just - I wanted to see her somehow . " But Andy had already turned away . I STILL REMEMBER the campaign ad , my own private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbled it together on Christmas Eve , and just after midnight in a darkened Boston studio , we cracked open a bottle of bourbon in celebration and sat back to view the final cut . I felt a wave of nausea roll over me as the first images flickered across the monitor .. Andy had shot the whole thing from distorted angles in grainy black and white , the film just a hair over-exposed to sharpen the contrast . Sixty seconds of derivative expressionism , some media critic dismissed it , but even he conceded it possessed a certain power . You 've seen it , too , I suppose . Who has n't ? She will rise from her grave to haunt you , the opening title card reads , and the image holds in utter silence for maybe half a second too long . Long enough to be unsettling , Andy said , and you could imagine distracted viewers all across the heartland perking up , wondering what the hell was wrong with the sound . The words dissolve into an image of hands , bloodless and pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , battered and raw and smeared with the filth and corruption of the grave , digging , digging . There 's something remorseless about them , something relentless and terrible . They could dig forever , and they might , you can see that . And now , gradually , you awaken to sound : rain hissing from a midnight sky , the steady slither of wet earth underhand , and something else , a sound so perfectly lacking that it 's almost palpable in its absence , the unearthly silence of the dead . Freeze frame on a tableau out of Goya or Bosch : seven or eight zombies , half-dressed and rotting , laboring tirelessly over a fresh grave . Fade to black , another slug line , another slow dissolve . Dana Maguire came back . The words melt into a long shot of the child , on her knees in the poison muck of the grave . Her dress clings to her thighs , and it 's a dress someone has taken some care about - white and lacy , the kind of dress you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it - and it 's ruined . All the care and heartache that went into that dress , utterly ruined . Tom and fouled and sopping . Rain slicks her blond hair black against her skull . And as the camera glides in upon Dana Maguire 's face , half-shadowed and filling three-quarters of the screen , you can glimpse the wound at her throat , flushed clean and pale . Dark roses of rot bloom along the high ridge of her cheekbone . Her eyes bum with the cold hard light of vistas you never want to see , not even in your dreams . The image holds for an instant , a mute imperative , and then , mercifully , fades . Words appear and deliquesce on an ebon screen , three phrases , one by one : The dead have spoken . Now it 's your turn . Burton for president . Andy touched a button . A reel caught and reversed itself . The screen went gray , and I realized I had forgotten to breathe . I sipped at my drink . The whiskey burned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think ? " Andy said . " I do n't know . I do n't know what to think . " Grinning , he ejected the tape and tossed it in my lap . " Merry Christmas , " he said , raising his glass . " To our savior born . " And so we drank again . Dizzy with exhaustion , I made my way back to my hotel and slept for eleven hours straight . I woke around noon on Christmas day . An hour later , I was on a plane . BY THE TIME I caught up to the campaign in Richmond , Lewis was in a rage , pale and apoplectic , his acne scars flaring an angry red . " You seen these ? " he said , thrusting a sheaf of papers at me . I glanced through them quickly - more bad news from Angela Dey , Burton slipping further in the polls - and then I set them aside . " Maybe this 'll help , " I said , holding up the tape Andy and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , Lewis and I , the entire senior staff , Burton himself , his face grim as the first images flickered across the screen . Even now , viewing it for the second time , I could feel its impact . And I could see it in the faces of the others as well - Dey 's jaw dropping open , Lewis snorting in disbelief . As the screen froze on the penultimate image - Dana Maguire 's decay-ravaged face - Libby Dixon turned away . " There 's no way we can run that , " she said . " We 've got - " I began , but Dey interrupted me . " She 's right , Rob . It 's not a campaign ad , it 's a horror movie . " She turned to Burton , drumming his fingers quietly at the head of the table . " You put this out there , you 'll drop ten points , I guarantee it . " " Lewis ? " Burton asked . Lewis pondered the issue for a moment , rubbing his pitted cheek with one crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The ad 's a frigging nightmare . It 's not the answer . " " The ad 's revolting , " Libby said . " The media will eat us alive for politicizing the kid 's death . " " We ought to be politicizing it , " I said . " We ought to make it mean something . " " You run that ad , Rob , " Lewis said , " every redneck in America is going to remember you threatening to take away their guns . You want to make that mistake twice ? " " Is it a mistake ? For Christ 's sake , the dead are walking , Lewis . The old rules do n't apply . " I turned to Libby . " What 's Stoddard say , Libby , can you tell me that ? " " He has n't touched it since election day . " " Exactly . He has n't said a thing &; not about Dana Maguire , not about the dead people staggering around in the street . Ever since the FEC overturned the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because it 's political suicide , " Dey said . " He 's been dodging it because it 's the right thing to do . " " Bullshit , " I snapped . " It 's not the right thing to do . It 's pandering and it 's cowardice- it 's moral cowardice- and if we do it we deserve to lose . " You could hear everything in the long silence that ensued - cars passing in the street , a local staffer talking on the phone in the next room , the faint tattoo of Burton 's fingers against the formica table top . I studied him for a moment , and once again I had that sense of something else speaking through me , as though I were merely a conduit for another voice . " What do you think about guns , sir ? " I asked . " What do you really think ? " Burton did n't answer for a long moment . When he did , I think he surprised everyone at the table . " The death rate by handguns in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet , " he said . " They ought to be melted into pig iron , just like Rob said . Let 's go with the ad . " " Sir - " Dey was standing . " I 've made up my mind , " Burton said . He picked up the sheaf of papers at his elbow and shuffled through them . " We 're down in Texas and California , we 're slipping in Michigan and Ohio . " He tossed the papers down in disgust . " Stoddard looks good in the south , Angela . What do we got to lose ? " We could n't have timed it better . The new ad went into national saturation on December 30th , in the shadow of a strange new year . I was watching a bowl game in my hotel room the first time I saw it on the air . It chilled me all over , as though I 'd never seen it before . Afterward , the room filled with the sound of the ball game , but now it all seemed hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaiety , the crack of pads had the crisp sharpness of movie sound effects . A barb of loneliness pierced me . I would have called someone , but I had no one to call . Snapping off the television , I pocketed my key-card . Downstairs , the same football game was playing , but at least there was liquor and a ring of conversation in the air . A few media folks from Burton 's entourage clustered around the bar , but I begged off when they invited me to join them . I sat at a table in the corner instead , staring blindly at the television and drinking scotch without any hurry , but without any effort to keep track either . I do n't know how much I drank that night , but I was a little unsteady when I stood to go . I had a bad moment on the way back to my room . When the elevator doors slid apart , I found I could n't remember my room number . I could n't say for sure I had even chosen the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bland and anonymous , a hallway of locked doors behind which only strangers slept . The endless weary grind of the campaign swept over me , and suddenly I was sick of it all - the long midnight flights and the hotel laundries , the relentless blur of cities and smiling faces . I wanted more than anything else in the world to go home . Not my cramped apartment in the District either . Home . Wherever that was . Independent of my brain , my fingers had found my key-card . I tugged it from my pocket and studied it grimly . I had chosen the right floor after all . Still in my clothes , I collapsed across my bed and fell asleep . I do n't remember any dreams , but sometime in the long cold hour before dawn , the phone yanked me awake . " Turn on CNN , " Lewis said . I listened to him breathe as I fumbled for the remote and cycled through the channels . I punched up the volume . " - unsubstantiated reports out of China concerning newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was awake now , fully awake . My head pounded . I had to work up some spit before I could speak . " Anyone got anything solid ? " I asked . " I 'm working with a guy in State for confirmation . So far we got nothing but rumor . " " If it 's true - " " If it 's true , " Lewis said , " you 're gon na look like a fucking genius . " Our numbers were soft in the morning , but things were looking up by mid-afternoon . The Chinese were n't talking and no one yet had footage of the Tibetan dead - but rumors were trickling in from around the globe . Unconfirmed reports from U.N . Peacekeepers in Kosovo told of women and children clawing their way free from previously unknown mass graves . By New Year 's Day , rumors gave away to established fact . The television flickered with grainy images from Groznyy and Addis Ababa . The dead were arising in scattered locales around the world . And here at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more enthusiastic at every rally , and as our jet winged down through the night toward Pittsburgh , I watched Stoddard answering questions about the crisis on a satellite feed from C-SPAN . He looked gray and tired , his long face brimming with uncertainty . He was too late , we owned the issue now , and watching him , I could see he knew it , too . He was going through the motions , that was all . There was a celebratory hum in the air as the plane settled to the tarmac . Burton spoke for a few minutes at the airport , and then the Secret Service people tightened the bubble , moving us en masse toward the motorcade . just before he ducked into the limo , Burton dismissed his entourage . His hand closed about my shoulder . " You 're with me , " he said . He was silent as the limo slid away into the night , but as the downtown towers loomed up before us he turned to look at me . " I wanted to thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held up his hand . " I would n't have had the courage to run that ad , not without you pushing me . I 've wondered about that , you know . It was like you knew something , like you knew the story was getting ready to break again . " I could sense the question behind his words - Did you know , Rob ? Did you ? - but I did n't have any answers . Just that impression of a voice speaking through me from beyond , from somewhere else , and that did n't make any sense , or none that I was able to share . " When I first got started in this business , " Burton was saying , " there was a local pol back in Chicago , kind of a mentor . He told me once you could tell what kind of man you were dealing with by the people he chose to surround himself with . When I think about that , I feel good , Rob . " He sighed . " The world 's gone crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on our side , I think we 'll be all right . I just wanted to tell you that . " " Thank you , sir . " He nodded . I could feel him studying me as I gazed out the window , but suddenly I could find nothing to say . I just sat there and watched the city slide by , the past welling up inside me . Unpleasant truths lurked like rocks just beneath the visible surface . I could sense them somehow . " You all right , Rob ? " " Just thinking , " I said . " Being in Pittsburgh , it brings back memories . " " I thought you grew up in California . " " I did . I was born here , though . I lived here until my parents died . " " How old were you ? " " Four . I was four years old . " We were at the hotel by then . As the motorcade swung across two empty lanes into the driveway , Gran 's words - that was your uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head . The limo eased to the curb . Doors slammed . Agents slid past outside , putting a protective cordon around the car . The door opened , and cold January air swept in . Burton was gathering his things . " Sir- " He paused , looking back . " Tomorrow morning , could I have some time alone ? " He frowned . " I do n't know , Rob , the schedule 's pretty tight- " " No , sir . I mean - I mean a few hours off . " " Something wrong ? " He held my gaze a moment longer . Then : " That 's fine , Rob . " He reached out and squeezed my shoulder . " Just be at the airport by two . " That night I dreamed of a place that was n't quite Dana Maguire 's daycare . It looked like a daycare - half a dozen squealing kids , big plastic toys , an indestructible grade of carpet - but certain details did n't fit : the massive grandfather clock , my uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dancing to big band music that seemed to emanate from nowhere . I was trying to puzzle this through when I saw the kid clutching the lunch sack . There was an odd expression on his face , a haunted heartbroken expression , and too late I understood what was about to happen . I was trying to move , to scream , anything , as he dragged the pistol out of the bag . But my lips were sealed , I could n't speak . Glancing down , I saw that I was rooted to the floor . Literally rooted . My bare feet had grown these long knotted tendrils . The carpet was twisted and raveled where they had driven themselves into the floor . My parents whirled about in an athletic fox trot , their faces manic with laughter . The music was building to an awful crescendo , percussives bleeding seamlessly together , the snap of the snare drums , the terrible booming tones of the clock , the quick sharp report of the gun . I saw the girl go over backward , her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , a spurting arterial fountain - I could feel it hot against my skin - and in the same moment this five-year-old kid turned to stare at me . Tears streamed down his cheeks , and this kid - this child really , and that 's all I could seem to think - he 's just a child he 's only a child - he had my face . I woke then , stifling a scream . Silence gripped the room and the corridor beyond it , and beyond that the city . I felt as if the world itself were drowning , sunk fathoms deep in the fine and private silence of the grave . I stood , brushing the curtains aside . An anonymous grid of lights burned beyond the glass , an alien hieroglyph pulsing with enigmatic significance . Staring out at it , I was seized by an impression of how fragile everything is , how thin the barrier that separates us from the abyss . I shrank from the window , terrified by a sense that the world was far larger - and immeasurably stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of vast and formless energies churning out there in the dark . I spent the next morning in the Carnegie Library in Oakland , reeling through back issues of the Post-Gazette . It did n't take long to dig up the article about the accident - I knew the date well enough - but I was n't quite prepared for what I found there . Gran had always been reticent about the wreck - about everything to do with my life in Pittsburgh , actually - but I 'd never really paused to give that much thought . She 'd lost her family , too , after all - a grand-daughter , a son-in-law , her only child and even as a kid , I could see why she might not want to talk about it . The headline flickering on the microfilm reader rocked me , though . Two die in fiery collision , it read , and before I could properly formulate the question in my mind - there were three of them -I was scanning the paragraphs below . Disconnected phrases seemed to hover above the cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and halfway through the article , the following words leapt out at me : Friends speculate that the accident may have been the product of a suicide pact . The couple were said to be grief-stricken following the death of their daughter , Alice , nine , in a bizarre shooting accident three weeks ago . I stood , abruptly nauseated , afraid to read any further . A docent approached " Sir , are you all - but I thrust her away . Outside , traffic lumbered by , stirring the slush on Forbes Avenue . I sat on a bench and fought the nausea for a long time , cradling my face in my hands while I waited for it to pass . A storm was drifting in , and when I felt better I lifted my face to the sky , anxious for the icy bum of snow against my cheeks . Somewhere in the city , Grant Burton was speaking . Somewhere , reanimated corpses scrabbled at frozen graves . The world lurched on . I stood , belting my coat . I had a plane to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during our final campaign swing through the midwest on January 3rd and the election that followed , but I think I had already arrived at a decision . Most of the senior staff sensed it , as well , I think . They congratulated me on persuading Burton to run the ad , but they did n't come to me for advice much in those final hours . I seemed set apart somehow , isolated , contagious . Lewis clapped me on the back as we watched the returns roll in . " Jesus , Rob , " he said , " you 're supposed to be happy right now . " " Are you , Lewis ? " I looked up at him , his tall figure slumped , his face a fiery map of scars . " What did you give up to get us here ? " I asked , but he did n't answer . I had n't expected him to . The election unfolded without a hitch . Leaving off their work in the graveyards , the dead gathered about the polling stations , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time around . They made no attempt to cast their ballots . They just stood behind the cordons the National Guard had set up , still and silent , regarding the proceedings with flat remorseless eyes . Voters scurried past them with bowed heads , their faces pinched against the stench of decay . On Nightline , Ted Koppel noted that the balloting had drawn the highest turnout in American history , something like ninety-three percent . " Any idea why so many voters came out today ? " he asked the panel . " Maybe they were afraid not to , " Cokie Roberts replied , and I felt an answering chord vibrate within me . Trust Cokie to get it right . Stoddard conceded soon after the polls closed in the West . It was obvious by then . In his victory speech , Burton talked about a mandate for change . " The people have spoken , " he said , and they had , but I could n't help wondering what might be speaking through them , and what it might be trying to say . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return to the graves , the world would be the old world we had known . But that 's not the way it happened . On January 5th , the dead were digging once again , their numbers always swelling . CNN was carrying the story when I handed Burton my resignation . He read it slowly and then he lifted his gaze to my face . " I ca n't accept this , Rob , " he said . " We need you now . The hard work 's just getting underway . " " I 'm sorry , sir . I have n't any choice . " " Surely we can work something out . " " I wish we could . " We went through several iterations of this exchange before he nodded . " We 'll miss you , " he said . " You 'll always have a place here , whenever you 're ready to get back in the game . " I was at the door when he called to me again . " Is there anything I can do to help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have to take care of this myself . " I SPENT A WEEK in Pittsburgh , walking the precipitous streets of neighborhoods I remembered only in my dreams . I passed a morning hunting up the house where my parents had lived , and one bright , cold afternoon I drove out 76 and pulled my rental to the side of the interstate , a hundred yards short of the bridge where they died . Eighteen-wheelers thundered past , throwing up glittering arcs of spray , and the smell of the highway enveloped me , diesel and iron . It was pretty much what I had expected , a slab of faceless concrete , nothing more . We leave no mark . Evenings , I took solitary meals in diners and talked to Gran on the telephone - tranquil gossip about the old folks in the home mostly , empty of anything real . Afterward , I drank Iron City and watched cable movies until I got drunk enough to sleep . I ignored the news as best I could , but I could n't help catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , the dead were walking . They walked in my dreams , as well , stirring memories better left forgotten . Mornings , I woke with a sense of dread , thinking of Galileo , thinking of the Church . I had urged Burton to engage this brave new world , yet the thought of embracing such a fundamental transformation of my own history - of following through on the article in the Post-Gazette , the portents within my dreams - paralyzed me utterly . I suppose it was by then a matter mostly of verifying my own fears and suspicions - suppose I already knew , at some level , what I had yet to confirm . But the lingering possibility of doubt was precious , safe , and I clung to it for a few days longer , unwilling to surrender . Finally , I could put it off no longer . I drove down to the Old Public Safety Building on Grant Street . Upstairs , a grizzled receptionist brought out the file I requested . It was all there in untutored bureaucratic prose . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white prints . I did n't want to look at them , but I did anyway . I felt it was something I ought to do . A little while later , someone touched my shoulder . It was the receptionist , her broad face creased with concern . Her spectacles swung at the end of a little silver chain as she bent over me . " You all right ? " she asked . " Yes , ma'am , I 'm fine . " I stood , closing the file , and thanked her for her time . I left Pittsburgh the next day , shedding the cold as the plane nosed above a lid of cloud . From LAX , I caught the 405 south to Long Beach . I drove with the window down , grateful for the warmth upon my arm , the spike of palm fronds against the sky . The slipstream carried the scent of a world blossoming and fresh , a future yet unmade , a landscape less scarred by history than the blighted industrial streets I 'd left behind . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had brought me here , after all . The nursing home was a sprawl of landscaped grounds and low-slung stucco buildings , faintly Spanish in design . I found Gran in a garden overlooking the Pacific , and I paused , studying her , before she noticed me in the doorway . She held a paperback in her lap , but she had left off reading to stare out across the water . A salt-laden breeze lifted her gray hair in wisps , and for a moment , looking at her , her eyes clear in her distinctly boned face , I could find my way back to the woman I had known as a boy . But the years intervened , the way they always do . In the end , I could n't help noticing her wasted body , or the glittering geometry of the wheelchair that enclosed her . Her injured leg jutted before her . I must have sighed , for she looked up , adjusting the angle of the chair . " Robert ! " " Gran . " I sat by her , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sun struck sparks from the wave-tops . " I 'd have thought you were too busy to visit , " she said , " now that your man has won the election . " " I 'm not so busy these days . I do n't work for him anymore . " " What do you mean - " " I mean I quit my job . " " Why ? " she said . " I spent some time in Pittsburgh . I 've been looking into things . " " Looking into things ? Whatever on Earth is there to look into , Robert ? " She smoothed the afghan covering her thighs , her fingers trembling . I laid my hand across them , but she pulled away . " Gran , we need to talk . " " Talk ? " She laughed , a bark of forced gaiety . " We talk every day . " " Look at me , " I said , and after a long moment , she did . I could see the fear in her eyes , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why I 'd never noticed it before . " We need to talk about the past . " " The past is dead , Robert . " Now it was my turn to laugh . " Nothing 's dead , Gran . Turn on the television sometime . Nothing stays dead anymore . Nothing . " " I do n't want to talk about that . " " Then what do you want to talk about ? " I waved an arm at the building behind us , the ammonia-scented corridors and the endless numbered rooms inhabited by faded old people , already ghosts of the dead they would become . " You want to talk about Cora in 203 and the way her son never visits her or Jerry in 147 whose emphysema has been giving him trouble or all the - " " All the what ? " she snapped , suddenly fierce . " All the fucking minutiae we always talk about ! " " I wo n't have you speak to me like that ! I raised you , I made you what you are today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , more quietly , I said it again . " I know . " Her hands twisted in her lap . " The doctors told me you 'd forget , it happens that way sometimes with trauma . You were so young . It seemed best somehow to just .. let it go . " " But you lied . " " I did n't choose any of this , " she said . " After it happened , your parents sent you out to me . Just for a little while , they said . They needed time to think things through . " She fell silent , squinting at the surf foaming on the rocks below . The sun bore down upon us , a heartbreaking disk of white in the faraway sky . " I never thought they 'd do what they did , " she said , " and then it was too late . After that ... how could I tell you ? " She clenched my hand . " You seemed okay , Robert . You seemed like you were fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " " Robert - " I turned at the door . She 'd wheeled the chair around to face me . Her leg thrust toward me in its cast , like the prow of a ship . She was in tears . " Why , Robert ? Why could n't you just leave everything alone ? " " I do n't know , " I said , but even then I was thinking of Lewis , that habit he has of probing at his face where the acne left it pitted - as if someday he 'll find his flesh smooth and handsome once again , and it 's through his hands he 'll know it . I guess that 's it , you know : we 've all been wounded , every one of us . And we just ca n't keep our hands off the scars . I drifted for the next day or two , living out of hotel rooms and haunting the places I 'd known growing up . They 'd changed like everything changes , the world always hurrying us along , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . I could n't leave Long Beach , not till I made things up with Gran , but something held me back . I felt ill at ease , restless . And then , as I fished through my wallet in a bar one afternoon , I saw a tiny slip of paper eddy to the floor . I knew what it was , of course , but I picked it up anyway . My fingers shook as I opened it up and stared at the message written there , Call me some time , with the address and phone number printed neatly below . I made it to Laguna Beach in fifty minutes . The address was a mile or so east of the water , a manicured duplex on a corner lot . She had moved , no doubt - five years had passed - and if she had n't moved she had married at the very least . But I left my car at the curb and walked up the sidewalk all the same . I could hear the bell through an open window , footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Then the door opened and she was there , wiping her hands on a towel . " Gwen , " I said . She did n't smile , but she did n't close the door either . It was a start . The house was small , but light , with wide windows in the kitchen overlooking a lush back lawn . A breeze slipped past the screens , infusing the kitchen with the scent of fresh-cut grass and the faraway smell of ocean . " This is n't a bad time , is it ? " I asked . " Well , it 's unexpected to say the least , " she told me , lifting one eyebrow doubtfully , and in the gesture I caught a glimpse of the girl I 'd known at Northwestern , rueful and wry and always faintly amused . As she made coffee , I studied her , still freckled and faintly gamine , but not unchanged . Her eyes had a wary light in them , and fresh lines caged her thin upper lip . When she sat across from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed a faint pale circle around her finger where a ring might have been . Maybe I looked older too , for Gwen glanced up at me from beneath a fringe of streaky blonde bangs , her mouth arcing in a crooked smile . " You look younger on television , " she said , and it was enough to get us started . Gwen knew a fair bit of my story - my role in Burton 's presidential campaign had bought me that much notoriety at least - and hers had a familiar ring to it . Law school at UCLA , five or six years billing hours in one of the big L.A. firms before the cutthroat culture got to her and she threw it over for a job with the ACLU , trading long days and a handsome wage for still longer ones and almost no wage at all . Her marriage had come apart around the same time . " Not out of any real animosity , " she said . " More like a mutual lack of interest . " " And now ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weight I had n't intended . She hesitated . " No one special . " She lifted the eyebrow once again . " A habit I picked up as a litigator . Risk aversion . " By this time , the sky beyond the windows had softened into twilight and our coffee had grown cold . As shadows lengthened in the little kitchen , I caught Gwen glancing at the clock . She had plans . I stood . " I should go . " " Right . " She took my hand at the door , a simple handshake , that 's all , but I felt something pass between us , an old connection close with a kind of electric spark . Maybe it was n't there at all , maybe I only wanted to feel it - Gwen certainly seemed willing to let me walk out of her life once again - but a kind of desperation seized me . Call it nostalgia or loneliness . Call it whatever you want . But suddenly the image of her wry glance from beneath the slant of hair leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , " I said , " I know this is kind of out of the blue , but you would n't be free for dinner would you ? " She paused a moment . The shadow of the door had fallen across her face . She laughed uncertainly , and when she spoke , her voice was husky and uncertain . " I do n't know , Rob . That was a long time ago . Like I said , I 'm a little risk averse these days . " " Right . Well , then , listen - it was really great seeing you . " I nodded and started across the lawn . I had the door of the rental open when she spoke again . " What the hell , " she said . " Let me make a call . It 's only dinner , right ? " I WENT BACK to Washington for the inauguration . Lewis and I stood together as we waited for the ceremony to begin , looking out at the dead . They had been on the move for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the eye could see . A cluster of the living , maybe a couple hundred strong , had been herded onto the lawn before the bandstand - a token crowd of warm bodies for the television cameras - but I could n't help thinking that Burton 's true constituency waited beyond the cordons , still and silent and unutterably patient , the melting pot made flesh : folk of every color , race , creed , and age , in every stage of decay that would allow them to stand upright . Dana Maguire might be out there somewhere . She probably was . The smell was palpable . Privately , Lewis had told me that the dead had begun gathering elsewhere in the world , as well . Our satellites had confirmed it . In Cuba and North Korea , in Yugoslavia and Rwanda , the dead were on the move , implacable and slow , their purposes unknown and maybe unknowable . " We need you , Rob , " he had said . " Worse than ever . " " I 'm not ready yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , his long pitted face sagging . " What happened to you ? " he asked . And so I told him . It was the first time I had spoken of it aloud , and I felt a burden sliding from my shoulders as the words slipped out . I told him all of it : Gran 's evasions and my reaction to Dana Maguire that day on CNN and the sense I 'd had on Crossfire that something else , something vast and remote and impersonal , was speaking through me , calling them back from the grave . I told him about the police report , too , how the memories had come crashing back upon me as I sat at the scarred table , staring into a file nearly three decades old . " It was a party , " I said . " My uncle was throwing a party and Mom and Dad 's babysitter had canceled at the last minute , so Don told them just to bring us along . He lived alone , you know . He did n't have kids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So the gun was n't locked up ? " " No . It was late . It must have been close to midnight by then . People were getting drunk and the music was loud and Alice did n't seem to want much to do with me . I was in my uncle 's bedroom , just fooling around the way kids do , and the gun was in the drawer of his night stand . " I paused , memory surging through me , and suddenly I was there again , a child in my uncle 's upstairs bedroom . Music thumped downstairs , jazzy big band music . I knew the grownups would be dancing and my dad would be nuzzling Mom 's neck , and that night when he kissed me good night , I 'd be able to smell him , the exotic aromas of bourbon and tobacco , shot through with the faint floral essence of Mom 's perfume . Then my eyes fell upon the gun in the drawer . The light from the hall summoned unsuspected depths from the blued barrel . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do was show Alice . I just wanted to show her . I never meant to hurt anyone . I never meant to hurt Alice . I said it to Lewis - " I never meant to hurt her " - and he looked away , unable to meet my eyes . I remember carrying the gun downstairs to the foyer , Mom and Dad dancing beyond the frame of the doorway , Alice standing there watching . " I remember everything , " I said to Lewis . " Everything but pulling the trigger . I remember the music screeching to a halt , somebody dragging the needle across the record , my mother screaming . I remember Alice lying on the floor and the blood and the weight of the gun in my hand . But the weird thing is , the thing I remember best is the way I felt at that moment . " " The way you felt , " Lewis said . " Yeah . A bullet had smashed the face of the clock , this big grandfather clock my uncle had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though the bullet had wrecked the mechanism . That 's what I remember most . The clock . I was afraid my uncle was going to be mad about the clock . " Lewis did something odd then . Reaching out , he clasped my shoulder - the first time he 'd ever touched me , really touched me , I mean - and I realized how strange it was that this man , this scarred , bitter man , had somehow become the only friend I have . I realized something else , too : how rarely I 'd known the touch of another human hand , how much I hungered for it . " You were a kid , Rob . " " I know . It 's not my fault . " " It 's no reason for you to leave , not now , not when we need you . Burton would have you back in a minute . He owes this election to you , he knows that . Come back . " " Not yet , " I said , " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upturned faces of the dead as a cold January wind whipped across the mall , I felt the lure and pull of the old life , sure as gravity . The game , Burton had called it , and it was a game , politics , the biggest Monopoly set in the world , and I loved it and for the first time I understood why I loved it . For the first time I understood something else , too : why I had waited years to ring Gwen 's doorbell , why even then it had taken an active effort of will not to turn away . It was the same reason : Because it was a game , a game with clear winners and losers , with rules as complex and arcane as a cotillion , and most of all because it partook so little of the messy turmoil of real life . The stakes seemed high , but they were n't . It was ritual , that was all - movement without action , a dance of spin and strategy designed to preserve the status quo . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get so involved in pushing your token around the board that you forget the ideals that brought you to the table in the first place . You forget to speak from the heart . Someday maybe , for the right reasons , I 'd come back . But not yet . I must have said it aloud for Lewis suddenly looked over at me . " What ? " he asked . I just shook my head and gazed out over the handful of living people , stirring as the ceremony got underway . The dead waited beyond them , rank upon rank of them with the earth of the grave under their nails and that cold shining in their eyes . I read a mute imperative there . This is your life , it said . Do n't waste it . Live . Live . And then I did turn to Lewis . " What do you think they want ? " I asked . Lewis sighed . " Justice , I suppose , " he said . " And when they have it ? " " Maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those words - justice , I suppose - still haunt me . I returned to D.C. in the fall , just as the leaves began turning along the Potomac . Gwen came with me , and sometimes , as I lie wakeful in the shelter of her warmth , my mind turns to the past . It was Gran that brought me back . The cast had come off in February , and one afternoon in March , Gwen and I stopped by , surprised to see her on her feet . She looked frail , but her eyes glinted with determination as she toiled along the.corridors behind her walker . " Let 's sit down and rest , " I said when she got winded , but she merely shook her head and kept moving . " Bones knit , Rob , " she told me . " Wounds heal , if you let them . " Those words haunt me , too . By the time she died in August , she 'd moved from the walker to a cane . Another month , her case manager told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We buried her in the plot where we laid my grandfather to rest , but I never went back after the interment . I know what I would find . The dead do not sleep . They shamble in silence through the cities of our world , their bodies slack and stinking of the grave , their eyes coldly ablaze . Baghdad fell in September , vanquished by battalions of revolutionaries , rallying behind a vanguard of the dead . State teems with similar rumors , and CNN is on the story . Unrest in Pyongyang , turmoil in Belgrade . In some views , Burton 's has been the most successful administration in history . All around the world , our enemies are falling . Yet more and more these days , I catch the president staring uneasily into the streets of Washington , aswarm with zombies . " Our conscience , " he 's taken to calling them , but I 'm not sure I agree . They demand nothing of us , after all . They seek no end we can perceive or understand . Perhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what they enable us to make of ourselves . And so we go on , mere lodgers in a world of unpeopled graves , subject ever to the remorseless scrutiny of the dead .
