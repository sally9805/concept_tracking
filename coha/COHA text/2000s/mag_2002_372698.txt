As an investing strategy , buy and hold has never been more suspect . Giant companies now collapse in scandal , like Enron ; fall woefully behind in technology , like Polaroid ; succumb to litigation , like Halliburton ( asbestos ) ; or get whacked by overpriced deals , like AOL . Are there still stocks that you can throw in a drawer and sleep well for years ? Or has investing got so hopelessly complicated that individuals should n't try to go it alone ? <P> TIME senior writer Daniel Kadlec questions five pros : Ron Baron , manager of Baron Asset Fund ; Eleanor Blayney , a financial planner at Sullivan Bruyette Speros &; Blayney ; Eric McKissack , a manager at Ariel Mutual Funds ; Gary Pilgrim , president of PBHG Funds ; and Gus Sauter , manager of the Vanguard 500 Index fund . Our panelists agree that diversified mutual funds are best for those with little penchant for serious stock research . For investors who want to buy individual stocks and are willing to do some homework , our pros offer tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME : Greedy , deceitful managers like those at Enron pose a risk for buy-and-hold investors . How do you defend against dishonesty ? <P> PILGRIM : The kind of problems we 're talking about with Enron  --  at large companies  --  is a fairly recent development . But routine efforts to stretch the financial truth , particularly among small companies , have been going on for a long time . It gets down to basic honesty and integrity . Some managements have a strong sense of that , and others do n't . Combine that with a flexible moral framework with stock options , and over a period of time the focus has increasingly shifted to how rich can you get , how fast ? The ploy is to keep expectations rising . But at some point the business wo n't support the expectations , and that 's when the cheating starts . <P> TIME : The spread of this behavior to large companies really undermines the buy-and-hold philosophy , since these are just the companies investors believe are safe . <P> PILGRIM : I agree . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other thing that 's been going on for years is managing earnings quarter to quarter to make it seem as though business is on a nice , smooth , upward slope . <P> TIME : But managed earnings can be good , right ? At least people thought that way about General Electric for decades . <P> BARON : I do n't think it 's a good thing . That 's not the way business works in the real world , and anyone who reports earnings at a predictable pace every single quarter , every single year is probably using practices that are questionable . <P> TIME : Would you stay away from GE for that reason ? <P> BARON : Yes . <P> TIME : Eleanor , what do you tell clients about managing company stock and stock options to stay away from a disaster like the one that befell Enron employees ? <P> BLAYNEY : Long before Enron came along , we were arm wrestling clients to divest , first in their 401(k) , then on their options . That 's a constant challenge as a planner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in it . <P> TIME : Options are tricky . You do n't want to exercise and sell the minute you have a 2-point gain . What 's the right formula ?
