Anyone who has ever visited the La Brea tar // pits in Los Angeles will understand how this great tasting // hors d " oeuvre got its name . The recipe came to // us from reader Metta Miller , from Boston , and it " s a // staff favorite . // 4 pounds chicken wings , split at joint and wing tips // discarded // 1 cup soy sauce // 1/2 cup dry red wine // 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar // 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger // Put a rack in middle of oven and preheat oven to // 400 ?
