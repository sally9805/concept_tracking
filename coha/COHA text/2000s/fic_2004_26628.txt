The Hidden Stars Book One of The Rune of Unmaking Chapter One On the great isle of Therie , there is a region north of the Siobhagh River where the barley fields and apple orchards of the south , the prosperous farms and the ancient many-towered cities , gleaming white and gold , give way to bleak dun-colored moorland , sullen hills , and rocky upland valleys . They call this country the Mointeach . Long ago , it was a land much plagued by warlocks , black bards , and cunning-men , but many perished at the Changing of the World , and many more fled at the coming of the High King . His allies were the mighty wizards of Leal , whose powers were far too great for these rustic necromancers and petty spellcasters to withstand  --  and there were still , in those days , many wild , uncivilized places in the world where those who made their living raising ghosts and cursing cattle might flourish unmolested . Yet they left a number of strange customs and beliefs behind them on the Mointeach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a rune-wand or a bundle of bones buried under the doorsill , some half-understood charm scratched upon the hearthstone . The land remained much as it had always been . Villages were few , and divided by vast tracts of wilderness , while the little stormy bays and inlets were treacherous and difficult to navigate . No visitor ever came there traveling for pleasure , and few of any sort came there at all . Yet it happened , one dreary day on the cusp of winter , in the time of the High King , that a trio of wizards trudged through the Mointeach . They were on their way to witness a birth and ( it might be ) a death , and a great sense of urgency and dread was on them . For hours they walked through country wild and trackless , while a lonely wind whistled in the rocky defiles , and hawks and gulls circled overhead . Late in the day , they finally came upon a road . Little more than a footpath it was , and very rough and stony , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for mile upon mile . They had seen no other signs of human habitation since landing their boat on one of the pebbly beaches to the northeast , and it seemed to the wizard Faolein and his two companions that this road must lead to the town of Cuirglaes . They decided to follow it . After skirting the hills for an hour or two , the track began to climb . The wizards kilted up their long robes and continued on . The road wound uphill between shadowy stands of pine and spruce . Every now and then the forest grew thinner , and Faolein could see all the way to the top of the hill , could just make out in the failing light a huddle of ancient buildings made of stacked stone . Could this be Cuirglaes ? he asked himself . They had been expecting a town of moderate size , at the very least a great seaside fortress , not this tiny isolated settlement . Sudden panic clutched at his throat . If they had missed their true road , gone somehow astray  - -  A scattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they touched the ground . Faolein tripped over a knotted root , barked his shin on a tree stump , righted himself , and continued on , trying to ignore the sting where his skin had been scraped raw . Clumsy . Clumsy he was and always had been , especially when he allowed his thoughts to wander , when he failed to use all six senses to observe his surroundings . The forest closed in again . Under the trees the air was damp and cool , heavy with the sharp scent of pine . He considered the possibility that a mistake had been made . The sky had been overcast since morning , with not a single gleam of sunlight the whole grey day . Nevertheless , his own sense of direction was good , and ireamhine 's was even better . He thought : If we 've gone astray , it is the curse at work . It must be . Mother and child will both die , and with them all our hope . Another bend in the road brought the village back into view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened from the road by a ragged line of beanpoles and skeletal dried cornstalks , Faolein spotted a cluster of buildings larger and more solidly built than the rest , and in their midst , thrusting upward , a round tower some thirty or forty feet high , with narrow windows set into the thickness of the walls . " Perhaps Cuirglaes after all , " said ireamhine . His pale , perfect face was impassive in the gathering gloom , the deep-set dark eyes without expression ; only his words betrayed his fear . " May the Fates grant that we come in time to save two lives and foil our enemy 's schemes . " Even as he spoke , the wind came up and scattered the clouds . The stone buildings on the summit stood silhouetted against a bloody sunset sky and the immense yellow moon , like a rotten pumpkin , just then rising behind the tor . As one man , the three wizards stopped where they stood , and Curide flung up his yew-wood staff like a barrier against the ill omen , muttering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , carried on the wind , thin but unmistakable , came the anguished cries of a woman suffering a difficult labor ... The Hidden Stars
