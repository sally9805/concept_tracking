Chapter One In 1960 , after two years of graduate school at Berkeley ; I returned to New York without a Ph.D . or any idea what I 'd do , only a desire to write stories . I 'd also been to graduate school at the University of Michigan , from 1953 to 1956 . All in all , five years of classes in literature . I do n't know how else I might have spent those five years , but I did n't want to hear more lectures , study for more exams , or see myself growing old in the library . There was an advertisement in the school paper for someone to take a car from Berkeley to New York , expenses paid . I made a phone call . A few days later , I was driving a Cadillac convertible through mountains and prairies , going back home , an overspecialized man , twenty-seven years old , who smoked cigarettes and could give no better account of himself than to say " I love to read . " It does n't qualify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , got along with my parents , and women liked me . Speeding toward the great city in a big , smooth-flowing car that was n't mine , I felt humored by the world . My parents ' apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , four rooms and a balcony , was too small for another adult , but I would n't be staying long . Anyhow , my mother let me feel like a child . It seemed natural . " What are you doing ? " she said . " Washing dishes ? Please , please , go away . Sit down . Have a cup of coffee . " My father sighed , shook his head , lit a cigar . Saying nothing , he told me that I had n't done much to make him happy . From their balcony , fourteen stories high , I looked down into Seward Park . Women sat along the benches , chatting . Their children played in the sandbox . Basketball and stickball games , on courts nearby , were in process morning and afternoon . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner of the park-cheap , bright , ugly clothing strewn along the benches . In the bushes , you could talk to a man about hot cameras and TV sets . At night , beneath the lush canopy of sycamores and oaks , prostitutes brought customers . Beyond the park , looking north , I saw Delancey Street , the mouth of the Williamsburg Bridge eating and disgorging traffic . Further north were the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building . Ever since I was a little kid , I 'd thought of them as two very important city people . A few degrees to the right , I saw the complicated steelwork of the 59th Street Bridge . To the west , beyond Chinatown ( where Arlene Ng , age ten , my first great love , once lived ) and beyond Little Italy ( where they shot Joey Gallo in Umberto 's Clam House on Mulberry Street ) , loomed Wall Street 's financial buildings and the Manhattan Bridge . Trucks , cars , and trains flashed through the grid of cables , crossing the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if in a dream , to and from the ocean . In the sky , squadrons of pigeons made grand loops , and soaring gulls made line drawings . There were also streaking sparrows , and airplanes heading toward India and Brazil . All day and night , from every direction , came the hum of the tremendum . I talked for hours on the telephone , telling my friends that I was home , and I sat up late at the kitchen table , drinking coffee , reading , and smoking . Most of the city slept . In the quiet , I heard police sirens as far away as Houston Street . Sometimes , I was awakened around noon or later by the smells of my mother 's cooking which , like sunlight , became more subtle as the hours passed . Days were much alike . I did n't know Monday from Wednesday until I saw it in the newspaper . I 'd forget immediately . After my parents had gone to bed , I 'd step out to buy The Times , then stare at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , none said my name . I wanted to do something . I did n't want something to do . Across the darkened living room , down the hall , in the big bed with my mother , my father lay snoring . Whatever my regrets about school-lost years , no Ph.D. -I was n't yet damaged by judgment . I had n't failed badly at anything-like Francis Gary Powers , for example , whose name I heard every day . His U-2 spy plane had been shot down over Russia , and he 'd failed to kill himself before being captured . Instead , he confessed to being a spy . President Eisenhower , who claimed the U-2 was a weather plane , looked like a liar . There were few heroes . Malcolm X and Fidel Castro , fantastically courageous , were figures of violent disorder . They had both been in jail . But even in sports , where heroes are simple , they could be the focus of violence . A mob swarmed out of the stands after a ballgame , surrounded the great Mickey Mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punched him in the jaw so hard they had to take X rays to see if the bone was broken . The odor of fresh newsprint , an oily film on my fingertips , mixed with cigarette smoke and the taste of coffee . Pages turned and crackled like fire , or like breaking bones . I read that 367 were killed in traffic accidents during the Memorial Day weekend , and , since the first automobile , over a million had been killed on our roads , more than in all our wars . And look : Two sisters were found dead in their apartment on Gracie Square , in the bathtub , wearing nightgowns . A razor lay in the hand of one of the sisters . Blood was n't mentioned . This was old-style journalism , respectfully distanced from personal tragedy . Nothing was said about how the sisters had arranged themselves in the tub . Their life drained away as the crowd vomited out of the stands to worship and mutilate Mickey Mantle . There were really no large meanings , only cries of the phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my species . * * * About a week after I arrived , I phoned Naomi Kane , a good pal from the University of Michigan . We 'd spent many hours together drinking coffee in the Student Union , center of romantic social life , gossip , and general sloth . Naomi , who had grown up in Detroit , in a big , comfortable house with elm trees all around , lived now in Greenwich Village , on the sixth floor of an old brick tenement on MacDougal Street . " Push the street door hard , " she said . " There is no bell and the lock does n't work . " From my parents ' apartment I walked to the subway ; caught the F train , took a seat , and was stunned into insentient passivity : The tram shrieked through the rock bowels of Manhattan to the West Fourth Street station . I walked up three flights of stairs in the dingy , resonant cavern , then out into the light of a hot Sunday afternoon . Village streets carried slow , turgid crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Eighth and Bleecker , the famous Eighth Street Bookshop at one end , the famous San Remo bar at the other . I 'd walked MacDougal Street innumerable times during my high school days , when my girlfriend lived in the Village , and , later , all through college , when my second girlfriend lived in the Village . But I 'd been gone two years . I had n't seen these huge new crowds , and new stores and coffeehouses all along the way . I had n't sensed the new apocalyptic atmosphere . Around then , Elvis Presley and Allen Ginsberg were kings of feeling , and the word love was like a proclamation with the force of kill . The movie Hiroshima , mon amour , about a woman in love with death , was a big hit . So was Black Orpheus , where death is in loving pursuit of a woman . I noticed a graffito chalked on the wall of the West Fourth Street subway station : FUCK HATE . Another read : Mayor Wagner is a lesbian . Wonderfully stupid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered a newspaper photo showing the city 's first meter maids , a hundred strong , in slate blue uniforms . They stood in lines , in a military manner , as Mayor Wagner reviewed them . Ergo : a lesbian . Before 1960 , could you have had this thought , made this joke ? There had been developments in sensibility , a visionary contagion derived maybe from drugs-marijuana , heroin , uppers , downers-the poetry of common conversation . Weird delirium was in the air , and in the sluggish , sensual bodies trudging down MacDougal Street . I pressed among them until I came to the narrow , sooty-faced tenement where Naomi lived . I pushed in through the door , into a long hallway painted with greenish enamel , giving the walls a fishy sheen . The hall went straight back through the building to the door of a coffeehouse called The Fat Black Pussy Cat . Urged by the oppressive , sickening green walls , hardly a foot from either shoulder , I walked quickly . Just before the door to The Fat Black Pussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banister . I climbed up six flights through the life of the building . A phonograph played blues ; an old lady screamed in Italian at a little boy named Bassano ; a hall toilet was clattering and flushing , flushing , flushing . At the sixth floor , I turned right and walked down a dark hallway , narrower than the one at street level . No overhead lights burned beyond the landing . There was the glow of a window at the end of the hallway . Brittle waves of old linoleum cracked like eggshells beneath my steps . Naomi 's door , formerly the entrance to an office , had a clouded glass window . I knocked . She opened . With a great hug , she welcomed me into a small kitchen . Behind her , I saw a refrigerator and stove . A half-wall partition separated the kitchen from the living room , with a gap that let you pass through . The partition served as a shelf for a telephone , papers , books , and pieces of clothing . A raw brick wall dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , splintery planks , as in a warehouse . It was strewn with underwear , shoes , and newspapers . Light , falling through a tall window , came from the west . The window looked over rooftops all the way to the Hudson River , then beyond to the cliffs of New Jersey . Another tall window , in the kitchen , looked east across MacDougal Street at a tenement just like this one . I supposed that Naomi 's apartment , in the middle of Greenwich Village , must be considered desirable . Naomi said , " Do n't make wisecracks . The rent is forty bucks a month . " Then she introduced me to Sylvia Bloch . She stood barefoot in the kitchen dragging a hairbrush down through her long , black , wet Asian hair . Minutes ago , apparently , she had stepped out of the shower , which was a high metal stall in the kitchen , set on a platform beside the sink . A plastic curtain kept water from splashing onto the kitchen floor . She said hello but did n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left , tossing the heavy black weight of hair like a shining sash . The brush swept down and ripped free until , abruptly , she quit brushing , stepped into the living room , dropped onto the couch , leaned back against the brick wall , and went totally limp . Then , from behind long black bangs , her eyes moved , looked at me . The question of what to do with my life was resolved for the next four years . Sylvia was slender and suntanned . Her hair fell below the middle of her back . Long bangs obscured her eyes , making her look shy or modestly hiding , and also shorter than average . She was five-six . Her eyes , black as her hair , were quick and brilliant . She had a high fine neck , wide shoulders , narrow hips , delicately shaped wrists and ankles . Her figure and the smooth length of her face , with its wide sensuous mouth , reminded me of Egyptian statuary . She wore a weightless cotton Indian dress with an intricate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her skin . We sat in the living room until Naomi 's boyfriend arrived . He was black , tall , light complexioned . Mixed couples were common , especially with Jewish women , but I was surprised . Conversation was awkward for me , determined not to stare at Sylvia . The summer heat and the messy living room with its dirty floor destroyed concentration , discouraged talk . Things were said , but it was dull obligatory stuff . Mainly we perspired and looked at one another . After a while , Naomi suggested we go for a walk . I was relieved and grateful . We all got up and left the apartment and went down into the street , staying loosely together , heading toward Washington Square Park . Naomi came up beside me and whispered , " She 's not beautiful , you know . " The remark embarrassed me . My feelings were too obvious . I 'd been hypnotized by Sylvia 's flashing exotic effect . Naomi sounded vaguely annoyed , as though I 'd disappointed her . She wanted to talk , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said " Ummm . " Incapable of anything better , I was literally meaningless . Naomi then said , as if she were making a concession , " Well , she is very smart . " We were supposed to have dinner together and go to a movie , but Naomi and her boyfriend disappeared , abandoning Sylvia and me in the park . Neither of us was talking . We 'd become social liabilities , too stupid with feeling to be fun . We continued together , as if dazed , drifting through dreamy heat . We 'd met for the first time less than an hour ago , yet it seemed we 'd been together , in the plenitude of this moment , forever . We walked for blocks without becoming flirtatious , barely glancing at each other , staying close . Eventually , we turned back toward the tenement ; with no reason , no words , slowly turning back through the crowded streets , then into the dismal green hall and up six flights of stairs , and into the squalid apartment , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . We made love until afternoon became twilight and twilight became black night . Through the tall open window of the living room we saw the night sky and heard the people proceed along MacDougal Street , as in a lunatic carnival , screaming , breaking glass , wanting to hit , needing meanness . Someone played a guitar in a nearby apartment . Someone was crying . Lights flew across the wails and ceiling . The city , made its statement in the living room . None of it had to do with us , lying naked on the couch , just wide enough for two , against the brick wall . Released by sex into simple confidence , we talked . Sylvia told me she was nineteen , and had recently left the University of Michigan , where she had met Naomi . Some years earlier , Sylvia 's father , who worked for the Fuller Brush company , died of a heart attack . The doctors had told him not to smoke and he tried to give it up , tearing his cigarettes in half , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one between his lips and light it . Her mother was a housewife who did well playing the stock market as a hobby . Soon after her husband 's death , she became ill with cancer . Sylvia visited her in the hospital every day after high school . She said her mother became exquisitely sensitive as she declined , until even the odor of the telephone cord beside her bed nauseated her . After her mother died , Sylvia lived with an aunt and uncle in Queens . She had bad dreams and heard jeering voices , as if the loss of her parents had made her contemptible . To get out of New York , she applied to the University of Michigan and Radcliffe . Her boyfriend was at Harvard . She described him as very kind and nice-looking , a lean , fine-featured blond . She said she was brighter than her boyfriend , but Radcliffe turned her down . They did n't need her ; they could easily fill every class with German Jews . Sylvia took the rejection personally . That was the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant . He was a tall , sweet , handsome Italian ; very sensitive and loving . He would show up tonight , she said . His swimsuit was in the apartment and he 'd come for it after work . Sylvia was telling me how she 'd met Naomi , and then telling me how much she loved Naomi . " But Naomi loves me in theory , not in practice , " said Sylvia . " She 's very critical , always complaining because she ca n't find a shoe or her glasses or something in the apartment . She sometimes threatens not to come home if I do n't clean up . " " Really ? " I was listening without hearing . The boyfriend would show up tonight . Sylvia had n't mentioned a boyfriend before she let me take off her clothes . I felt deceived . I wanted to go . She had a boyfriend . I 'd have done it anyway , maybe , but I felt suddenly distanced from Sylvia , as if I 'd dropped through the darkness into a well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagined my clothes on the floor beside the bed . I could reach down , grab my underwear and pants , dress , go . I did n't move . " He has a key ? " " No . " " The door is locked ? " " Yes . " " Look , I should go . I 'll phone you in the morning . " " Stay . " She got up . Without turning on a light , which would show in the glass window of the door , she moved quickly in the chaos of the apartment , shoving books and papers about , tossing pieces of clothing , and then she found it , with blind feel only , a rag amid rags . His swimsuit . She hung it on the doorknob outside the apartment by the jock , then returned to the bed .
