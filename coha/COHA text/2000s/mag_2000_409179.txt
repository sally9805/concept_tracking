I By Gary Seronik // Goodbye to Bad Vibes Single-stalk diagonal holders provide a simple and effective means of mounting a Newtonian reflector 's secondary mirror . Unfortunately , the longer the stalk and the heavier the diagonal mirror , the more prone the arrangement is to vibration . Mark Zemanek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fellow-ATM Tom Krajci . Zemanek drilled a hole in a rubber eraser and slid it down the stalk until it was snug against the tube wall . " It has reduced vibration by a good 50 percent . It was a pleasure to see objects in the eyepiece snap into focus without waiting for vibrations to die down , " reports Zemanek . Two-Tiered Dobsonian To sit or to stand ? Depending on where your telescope is aimed , it might be uncomfortable to do one or the other . In some positions the eyepiece might be positioned too high for seated viewing , while in others it is low enough that bending over is necessary , leading to a sore back . Luckily , there is an alternative to the fixed-height rocker box found on most Dobsonian telescopes . With Kentucky amateur John Holland 's Hi-Lo Dobsonian , the telescope 's height can be adjusted by 10 inches simply by shifting the telescope tube on the two-level rocker box . Writes Holland , " This allows both short and tall people to view with comfort and ease . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 " myself . " Powerful Counterweight Photograph Photograph // For astronomers on the go , keeping equipment bulk and weight to a minimum is a constant battle . This is especially true for eclipse chasers , who must comply with the luggage limitations imposed by commercial airlines . Singaporean amateur Soh Kim Mun has come up with an ingenious way to deal with the four D-cell batteries that supply power to his portable telescope . He bored four battery-size cavities into his mount 's counterweight . By using brass strips to provide the electrical connection between the individual batteries , and a pair of round plastic plates ( one on the top , the other on the bottom ) to hold the assembly together , Soh was able to put the weight of his batteries to productive use . One-Ton Portable Mount A Photograph // Tired of flimsy tripods that quaked and quivered in the slightest breeze , Greek amateur George Tatsis decided to make his portable observing setup solid - really solid . Tatsis mated his Tele Vue Ranger 70-millimeter refractor and its altazimuth mount to the roof rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than drilling a hole in the roof rack and running a standard Y4-20 bolt through the rack into the base of the mount . Concludes Tatsis , " All you need is a flat surface to park your car and there 's no going back to any kind of tripod . ' Ready-Made Dust Covers Photograph // The ideal telescope cover is one that keeps out dust but allows the moisture from a dewy night under the stars to escape . As Julie Hards of West Valley , Utah , points Out , such telescope covers already exist in the form of pillow cases designed for body pillows . Measuring 20 by 60 inches , they are large enough for most 8inch reflectors and can be found in almost any store that sells bedding supplies . The covers come in a variety of designer colors and patterns to match the decor of any home . A Place for Everything and Everything in its Place Photograph // As every amateur astronomer knows , there are always more telescope accessories than there are convenient places to put them . To avoid having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepieces , filters , tools , and various bits and pieces within easy reach . Unfortunately , the accessory trays supplied with most commercial mounts are often too small or difficult to reach . Andre Medvedeff of Clearwater , Florida , designed and built an accessory shelf perfectly matched to his needs . Of course , that 's part of the beauty of his setup - it is eminently customizable to the needs of the individual observer . The shelf braces against two tripod legs and is held in place with a single L-bracket fitted to the top of the tripod . Or , the reverse side is a hook for the telescope 's lens cap . Medvedeff even equipped his telescope 's shelf with a form-fitting leather cover to protect his accessories from dust when they 're not in use . Photograph // <p>
