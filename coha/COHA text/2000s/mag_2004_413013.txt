How to buy the right rose for your garden without getting stuck // Garden fashions come and go-right now , pale English borders are out , and hot-colored tropicals are in-but through it all , roses remain . No other flower is as widely loved , as widely planted-or as likely to cause you some sort of grief . And now that rose bushes are sold by supermarkets and big-box stores , die grief quotient appears to be rising . It does n't have to be that way . With several dozen classes of roses and somewhere around 11,000 varieties in commerce in die United States , at least a few will be right for you , no matter where you live or how verdant your thumb . The trick is knowing how to pick them without getting stuck . To that end , MONEY consulted expert rosarians , as rose specialists are called , from around the country . The result : five tips for success with roses . 1 . Know what you want Our experts all said that impulse shopping is responsible for the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love at first sight , " says Jeff Wyckoff , national chairman of horticultural judging for the American Rose Society . " You will have much greater success if you start with a list of priorities . " Do you want a small , tidy plant or something the size of a house ? Are you set on a hybrid tea , like the roses at the florist , or do you crave an old garden rose , as round and ruffled as an antebellum crinoline ? What color will fill the bill ? And just how do you feel about diorns ? Most roses marketed as " easy " are very prickly characters . 2 . Know your growing conditions Roses love sun and must have at least five or six hours of it a day in order to bloom . They also need well-drained , fertile soil . And location matters . " Folks in Southern California can easily grow beautiful hybrid teas , while simply getting the plants to survive is a struggle in the upper Midwest , " says Peter Schneider , co-editor of the Combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties ( combinedroselist . com ; 330-296-2618 ) . And there 's more to it than just stayin ' alive . Carl Wagner , a longtime rosarian and judge for die American Rose Society who gardens in Leakey , Texas , advises choosing hybrid teas with a high petal count because they last longer in the heat . The deep red ' Uncle Joe ' is " foolproof , " he says . But Wyckoff , who gardens in Seattle , volunteers that ' Uncle Joe ' often fails to open in the Northwest . Hybrid teas with fewer petals usually do better there , he says , " and so do those old garden roses , like gallicas , that bloom only once a year . If you live where there is a lot of hot weadier , " he adds , " rebloomers like Chinas , teas and noisettes are better old roses to choose . " 3 . Read up China ? Gallica ? Noisette ? And dial 's just the start of it . Get ready for damask , Bourbon and many others . You 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general sense of rose classes . The excellent short overview in Roses , by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix ( Random House , 1988 ) , is one of my favorites ; the book is currently out of print but is widely available used . Once you see the range of choices , you may want types of roses-like those gallicas and damasks-that do n't show up at die corner nursery . The Combined Rose List and the rose branch of helpmefind.com can lead you to diousands of varieties and hundreds of specialty nurseries . For users ' reviews of rose nurseries , check out the website Gardenwatchdog.com. 4 . Be skeptical Catalogues from specialty nurseries offer hundreds of roses , each of which sounds more glorious than the last . Many truly are terrific , but it is wise to take the descriptions with a grain of salt , says Suzanne Verrier , author of Rosa Rugosa ( Firefly Books , 1999 ) , who runs North Creek Farm rose nursery in Phippsburg , Maine . A spoonful of salt might be a better measure . Catalogues are ads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sure to get this disfiguring disease . " Light , " " delicate " or " subtle " fragrance means you wo n't detect any scent unless your uncle was a bloodhound . " Tolerates heat " means the plant wo n't do diddly unless you can use the pool for at least eight months a year . 5 . Buy the best You can find plenty of gorgeous roses at your neighborhood nursery , but it pays to be a picky customer . Most of the potted roses you 'll find there are field grown by wholesale nurseries and will carry a grade label : No. 1 for two-year-old plants with at least three strong main stems ; No. 1 for two-year-old plants that have two main stems ; and No. 2 for plants that are only one year old . ( Some specialty nurseries , primarily mail-order sellers , grow their own and may not use the grading system . ) " Buying grade No. 1 roses is always worth the investment , " says Kitty Belendez , president emeritus of the Los Angeles Rose Society . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for the rose , and the time it takes to reach its potential , there 's no sense in starting out with anything less than die best . In spring you may see plants being sold " bare root " instead of planted in soil . Because the naked roots must be packed in moist material , kept cool and planted as soon as possible , this works best with mail orders . A bare-root rose that 's been sitting around in a store is never a bargain , no matter what it costs . Look past the flowers on blooming plants and avoid those with crossing main branches , which will cause problems later . Check for aphids , yellowing leaves or other signs of distress . And do n't automatically assume that a big , bushy plant is robust . Most wholesale growers and retail nurseries routinely use lots of pesticides and fungicides , so if the variety is disease-prone , you 'll probably need to keep spraying . How can you know if the rose you like is disease-prone ? Go home and Google it , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " below .
