Chapter One Two Weeks Earlier Hannah Swensen did her best to convince her sleep-logged mind that the insistent electronic beeping she heard was in the soundtrack of her dream . A huge semi tractor-trailer was backing up to the kitchen door of her bakery , The Cookie Jar , to deliver the mountain of chocolate chips she 'd ordered for the gazillion Chocolate Chip Crunch Cookies she 'd promised to bake for her biggest fan , Porky Pig , who 'd finally overcome his stutter with the help of a voice coach and was now being sworn in as president of the United States ... The dream slipped away like the veils of Salome , and Hannah groaned as she clicked on the light . No doubt her dream was the result of watching Cartoon Network until two in the morning and eating two dishes of chocolate ice cream with a whole bag of microwave popcorn . She silenced the alarm and threw back the covers , sitting up in bed in an effort to fight her urge to burrow back into her warm blankets and pull them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moishe , " she said , nudging the orange-and white lump that nestled at the foot of her bed . " Daylight in the swamps , dawn in the desert , and sunrise in Lake Eden , Minnesota . " Moishe 's yellow eyes popped open . He looked out the window into the darkness beyond , then swiveled his head to stare at her accusingly . While most people did n't think cats could understand " human-speak , " Hannah was n't most people.This was primarily because Moishe was n't most cats . " Sorry , " Hannah apologized , backpedaling under his unblinking yellow gaze . " It 's not really daylight in Lake Eden , but it will be soon and I have to get up for work . " Moishe seemed to accept her explanation . He opened his mouth in a wide yawn and gave the little squeak in the middle that Hannah found endearing . Then he began to stretch . Hannah never tired of watching her previously homeless tomcat go through his morning calisthenics . Moishe rolled onto his back and gazed up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fascist salute and after a slight pause , his left front leg shot up to join it . Then his back legs pushed toward the foot of the bed and spread out in a tensely inverted " Y , " like the handholds of a witching rod . Once his whole body was stretched taut , he began to quiver like the proverbial bowlful of Jell-O . The kitty quiver lasted for several seconds and then Moishe flipped from back to stomach . This was the position Hannah called " shoveled , " because it was about as flat as a cat could get without the aid of a steamroller . All four legs were stretched out to the max and Moishe 's chin was perfectly parallel to the worn nap on the chenille bedspread Hannah had rescued from Helping Hands , Lake Eden 's only thrift store . The part that came next was Hannah 's favorite . Moishe 's back legs moved forward , first the left and then the right , in what her first grade friends had called " giant steps " in their games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Moishe 's rear was up in the air , his hips so high it turned him into a kitty teepee . Once the apex had been reached , he gave a little sigh , a little shake , a little flick of both ears simultaneously , and then he made a big leap to the floor to follow Hannah down the hallway . " Hold on , " Hannah said , hopping from foot to foot as she pulled on her fleece-lined moccasin slippers . " You know you ca n't open the Kibble Keeper by yourself . " After a short trip down the hall spent dodging Moishe 's efforts to catch the laces on her slipper , Hannah reached the kitchen . She flicked on the bank of fluorescent lights and winced as the walls shimmered dazzling white to her sleep-deprived eyes . Perhaps it was time to paint her walls a darker color , a color like black , especially if she kept operating on three hours of sleep . Last night had been another night in a long string of nights spent in her living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat perched on her chest , watching television until the wee small hours of the morning and wrestling with a decision that would have stymied even Solomon . An indignant yowl brought Hannah back to matters at hand and she opened the broom closet to lift out the Kibble Keeper . It was a round , gray , bucket-type container with a screw-on lid that was guaranteed to keep out even the most persistent pet . Hannah had found it at the Tri-County Mall after Moishe had defeated every other means she 'd tried to keep him from helping himself to his own breakfast . It was n't that she begrudged him food . It was the cleanup that made feline self-service dining unfeasible . Hannah had swept up and dumped out the last kitty crunchy she was about to sweep and dump , and the salesclerk at the pet store had assured her that no living being that lacked opposable thumbs could open the Kibble Keeper . It was made of a resin that was impervious to biting and scratching , knocking it over and batting it around had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been tested on a tiger at the Minnesota Zoo and come through with flying colors . Even though Hannah knew that Moishe was physically incapable of unscrewing the lid , she still concealed her actions from him . It was n't wise to underestimate the cat who was capable of so much more than the ordinary tabby . " Here you go , " she said , scooping out a generous helping and dumping it into his bowl . " Finish that and I 'll give you some more . " While her feline roommate crunched , Hannah poured herself a cup of steaming coffee and sent a silent message of thanks to whoever had invented the automatic timer . She took one sip , swallowed painfully , and added a coffee ice cube from the bag she always kept in the freezer . A regular ice cube would dilute what her grandmother had called " Swedish Plasma , " and that was why Hannah kept one ice cube tray filled with frozen coffee . She needed her caffeine full-strength in the morning . Several big gulps and Hannah felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was time to shower and dress . The lure of a second cup of coffee would make her hurry , and she was awake enough not to doze off and turn as red as a lobster under the steaming spray . Hannah reentered the kitchen eleven minutes later , her red hair a damp mass of towel-dried curls , and clad in jeans and a dark green sweatshirt that proclaimed CHOCOLATE IS A VEGETABLE-IT COMES FROM BEANS in bright yellow script . She 'd just poured herself that second cup of coffee when the phone rang . Hannah reached for the bright red wall phone that hung over the kitchen table , but she stopped in midstretch . " What if it 's Mike ? Or Norman ? " " Rrowww ! " Moishe responded , looking up at the phone as it rang again . " Yowwwww ! " " You 're right . So what if they both proposed ? And so what if they 're waiting for me to choose between them ? I 'm thirty years old , I run my own business , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into a decision I might regret later ... including Mother . " As Hannah uttered the final word , Moishe 's ears flattened against his head and he bristled like a Halloween cat . He despised Delores Swensen and Hannah 's mother had a drawer full of shredded pantyhose to prove it . " Do n't worry . If it 's Mother , you do n't have to speak to her . " Hannah took a deep breath and grabbed the phone , sinking down in a chair to answer . If it was her mother , the conversation would take a while and there were bound to be unveiled references to her unmarried state . If it was her younger sister , Andrea , the conversation would include the latest about Hannah 's two nieces , Tracey and Bethany , and it would also take a while . If it was Michelle , Hannah 's youngest sister , they were bound to have a discussion about college life at Macalester College and that would also eat up the minutes Hannah had left before she had to go to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping mightily that it was n't either of the two men in her life . " What took you so long ? I was almost ready to give up , but I knew you would n't leave for work this early . " It was a man , but it was n't either of the two in question and Hannah breathed a sigh of relief . It was Andrea 's husband , Bill , the only other early riser in the Swensen family . " Hi , Bill . What 's up ? " " I am . I 'm out here at the sheriff 's station and we 've got a problem . " Hannah glanced at the clock . It was only five-fifteen . Bill kept regular hours now that he was the Winnetka County Sheriff . He never went to the office until eight unless there was an emergency . " Is there anything I can do to help ? " " You bet there is . And you 're the only one who can fix this mess ! " " What mess ? " Hannah had visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and murder victims stacked up like cordwood . But if crime was running rampant in Lake Eden , she certainly had n't heard about it . And how could she possible be the only one who could fix it ? " It 's Mike . You really did a number on him , Hannah . One minute he 's on top of the world , telling everybody that you 're bound to choose him . The next minute he 's all down in the mouth , absolutely sure that you 're going to ditch him and marry Norman . " Hannah did her best to think of something to say . It was n't her fault that Mike could n't handle the stress of waiting while she made up her mind which proposal to accept . It had been only a week . A girl , even one whose mother thought her old enough to qualify as an old maid , was entitled to all the time she needed for such an important decision . " Look , Hannah . I know it 's not totally your fault , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dangerous ? " " That 's right . Mike 's supposed to be my head detective , my right hand when it comes to solving crime . The way he 's acting right now , he could n't catch a perp even if the guy stood in front of his desk holding a sign that said , I DID IT . I mean , what if we have a real murder , or something like that ? What 'll happen then ? " Hannah let out her breath . She had n't even realized she 'd been holding it . " So what do you want me to do ? " " Make up your mind so Mike can get back to work . Fish , or cut bait ... you know ? " ( Continues ... )
