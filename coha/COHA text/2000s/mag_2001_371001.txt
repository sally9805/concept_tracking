The boat industry was in another of its typically brutal down cycles in the early 1990s when Irwin Jacobs decided that his business did n't have to be so sink-or-swim . Lured with the right bait , Irwin figured , fishermen could offer his company , Genmar Holdings Inc. , a buffer of steady , stable growth . After all , the U.S. is a nation of fishing fools  --  a group estimated to be 55 million strong that buys $40 billion in equipment each year , from rods to reels to tackle boxes . Jacobs , 60 , saw a rare and untapped bounty . " I do n't make a hundred bets , " says Jacobs , who in his other life is a famous Wall Street dealmaker . <P> His bet : if you create a bass-competition circuit , it could harness the wealth of fishermen and - women into a huge new market that would rival NASCAR in popular appeal and in its ability to attract corporate sponsors who would want to reach them . " They 'd never been marketed to as a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having once been majority owner of the Minnesota Vikings . <P> Today Jacobs ' brainchild , FLW Tour ( named after bass-boat pioneer Forrest L. Wood ) , has moved tournament bass fishing from the swampy border of sports to deep in the mainstream . Each week pro fishermen aboard boats that resemble floating billboards  --  welcome to BASSCAR  --  seek out big fish and big bucks . There are now four separate bass tours and a fifth for walleye that began this year . At this year 's championship , to be held on Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh , N.Y. , the winner will net $250,000 . Says Irwin : " I 'm sitting here feeling pretty good . " <P> The FLW has hooked such big-name sponsors as Chevrolet , Kellogg 's and Pepsi . " We turn down more sponsorships than we have , " Irwin says . And the competition has become a staple on ESPN and ESPN2 . Initially , Irwin had to produce the program and buy the ad space himself just to guarantee the airtime . <P> But Irwin admits that FLW 's fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he persuaded Lee Scott , now CEO of the cautious but deep-pocketed Wal-Mart , to make the retailer FLW 's marquee sponsor . " I said , ' Lee , we 've got a program that is absolutely your customer , ' " recalls Jacobs . " He said , ' Look , we do n't do those kinds of things . ' " They do now . <P>  --  By Ron Stodghill II
