Venture capital investment in the U.S. is steadying after three years of sharp decline . Though the $4.2 billion invested in start-ups in the third quarter dropped 4.4% , this is the lowest year-to-year quarterly decrease since the industry peaked in the first quarter of 2000 , when $28.6 billion was invested . " It was an unhealthy level of investment in 1999 and 2000 , " says the National Venture Capital Association 's Jeanne Metzger . " Now we 've leveled off comfortably , at about $4 billion a quarter . " Biotech is the main beneficiary , having received $873 million in the third quarter , unseating software and reaching the top for the first time in seven years . New money has been slow to flow into venture-capital firms , but that should n't hurt young companies hungry for funding . The venture capitals did n't lose it all in the bust . They are still sitting on $84 billion in capital .
