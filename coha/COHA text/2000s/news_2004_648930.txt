<p> When Larry Lucchino turns away from his computer and rises from the swivel chair in his office , he is at eye level with a program from the 2003 American League Championship Series . A fan framed it and sent it to Lucchino , the president of the Boston Red Sox , at Fenway Park . Beneath the cover are the scores of each game between the Red Sox and the Yankees , and two words : unfinished business . <p> When Lucchino leaves the office , he may glimpse the front page of The Boston Evening Globe from Sept. 11 , 1918 , the last time business really was finished at Fenway . A framed copy proclaiming the last Red Sox championship hangs alone on a wall opposite the lobby receptionist . " No more than 15,000 persons were on hand , " the article begins , and the play-by-play shows that Red Sox left fielder Babe Ruth caught the second-to-last out . <p> History stalks the Red Sox , and the front office deals with it by embracing the present . Lucchino delights in surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the franchise-record attendance total from 2003 ? ( 2,724,162 ) Other numbers are less cheery but easier to remember . <p> " We have finished second six years in a row , " John Henry , the principal owner , wrote in an e-mail message . " We have n't won a championship in 86 years . Given that we have undoubtedly the most ardent fans in baseball , this is our mandate . We can leave no stone unturned . It 's a real-life Arthurian quest . It 's an epic saga that plays out over every single day , 365 days a year , in Boston . " <p> More than ever , it seems , the Red Sox are a year-round phenomenon . Just after the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl on Feb. 1 , a Red Sox-sponsored ad ran on local television stations . Terry Francona , the new Boston manager , congratulated Patriots Coach Bill Belichick . " Talk about a tough act to follow , " Francona said . <p> The Red Sox believe they can sustain the Patriots ' euphoria and build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The satisfaction that will come when  --  and I say when  --  we win a world championship will be enormous , " Tom Werner , the chairman of the Red Sox , said . " The jubilation in New England will just be amazing . It will be so sweet , it will make all the travail worth it . " <p> Werner , who watched the 1967 World Series from the Fenway bleachers during his freshman year at Harvard , was referring to the decades since 1918 . But he could have been alluding to the two years since the group headed by Henry , Werner and Lucchino bought the Red Sox for $660 million . ( The New York Times Company is a minority partner of the ownership group . ) <p> The team has not ruled out replacing Fenway , but it has focused on improvements that have made the 92-year-old park more popular and profitable . Concourses have been added or expanded , and after the success of the Green Monster seats in left last season , 200 more seats are being built on the roof above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the Red Sox had sold 1,781,000 tickets for this season , a 49 percent increase over the same date last year , when the team had sold 1,198,000 tickets . The team has sold 3,500 new season tickets , Lucchino said , compared with 500 last off-season . <p> The enthusiasm comes in the wake of another epic fold by a franchise famous for them . But after the Red Sox blew a three-run lead with five outs to go in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium , they succeeded in enacting an aggressive and fearless winter plan . <p> With a sense of desperation , a thick wallet and a curiosity to explore even the most fanciful ideas , notably the failed trade for Alex Rodriguez , Boston may have positioned itself as the best team in baseball . <p> " I 've been in the game long enough to know how unpredictable it is , how important randomness is to the success and failure of teams , and to know how important health issues are , " Lucchino said . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . " <p> Aggressive Against Yankees <p> The Red Sox traded for an ace starter , Curt Schilling , and signed an All-Star closer , Keith Foulke . They retained most of the offense that produced the highest slugging percentage in major league history last season . Pokey Reese replaced Todd Walker to improve the defense at second base , and the veteran Ellis Burks returned as a designated hitter against left-handers . <p> The payroll will rise from last season , when it was $108 million , and though the rest of the A.L . East has improved , the Red Sox and the Yankees may be the most assertive teams in the majors . " They 're every bit comparable to the Yankees in the sense that they have money and they 're smart , " Toronto Blue Jays General Manager J. P. Ricciardi said . " When you 're dealing with smart people who have resources , it 's a dangerous combination . " <p> Brian Cashman , the Yankees ' general manager , said the Red Sox had poured the extra cash from improvements to Fenway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Cashman said . " They 're aggressive like we 're aggressive . " <p> The Red Sox would rather be feisty underdog than fellow fat cat . The difference between the organizations ? " Besides light and darkness , good and evil ? " Lucchino said , laughing . " Sorry . " <p> Lucchino earned the eternal outrage of George Steinbrenner , the Yankees ' principal owner , by calling them the evil empire in December 2002 . Henry , once a limited partner of Steinbrenner 's , said the Red Sox and the Yankees were worlds apart in approach . <p> " The Yankees can essentially pursue any player , " Henry wrote . " We have our limits . They were evident in the potential Alex Rodriguez transaction . We clearly told all sides what our limitations were and went as far as we could go . " <p> But the Red Sox have enough resources , General Manager Theo Epstein said , that they are compelled to at least investigate every available player . He does not mind the workload . <p> Epstein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , said he had never lapsed into wonderment in his first year on the job . But as he watched the Red Sox take a 5-2 lead in the eighth inning of Game 7 last fall , he said , he thought of Williams and Pesky , Rice and Yaz , all the Boston teams that had never slain the Yankees . <p> Then the Yankees roared back against an exhausted Pedro Martinez to tie the score . In the 11th inning , Aaron Boone lifted a homer into the left-field seats to eliminate the Red Sox . Epstein staggered with the rest of the faithful , then made a decree . <p> " In baseball operations , we instituted a 24-hour rule , " Epstein said . " For 24 hours , we allowed ourselves to moan and feel sorry for ourselves and yell , ' Five more outs ! ' and things of that nature . And we stopped after 24 hours . " <p> Epstein paused . " I think it became a 36-hour rule , actually . But after 36 hours , we stopped and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the frustration over the outcome of that game to really motivate us to have a good off-season . " <p> A Philosophy With Statistics <p> The previous off-season had been a bargain hunt , and although some moves flopped  --  Ramiro Mendoza , Jeremy Giambi  --  others succeeded wildly . For a combined $5.3 million in 2003 , the Red Sox signed David Ortiz , Kevin Millar and Bill Mueller , who all became mainstays in the lineup . <p> Epstein has heard the talk that the Red Sox may suffer this season because so many players had career years in 2003 , but he dismissed that idea , using Mueller as an example . The same factors that produced a batting title for Mueller  --  good health , a ballpark suited to his style of hitting and a disciplined approach  --  would be unchanged , Epstein said . <p> Still , the Red Sox shopped in a tonier district this off-season . Seeing fewer bargains available , they traded for Schilling and signed Foulke , who will combine to make $15 million this season . Pursuing high-priced talent made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would have been a waste to do that last year , when you could get comparable production for much less cost , " he said . <p> The best-known adviser to Epstein is Bill James , the author who pioneered the use of statistics to analyze performance and wrote five reports for the Red Sox last season . Henry , a commodities trader who made his fortune developing a formula for forecasting markets , seems especially fond of James . " He is every bit as passionate about what we are trying to accomplish as we are , " Henry wrote . " What a great perk of this job it is to be able to ask Bill James questions ! " <p> One reason the Red Sox fired Grady Little was that they wanted a manager more receptive to the front office 's philosophies . They found that in Francona , who most recently worked for the Oakland Athletics , the team renowned for its emphasis on statistics . ( Francona 's presence also helped persuade Schilling , who played for him in Philadelphia , to approve the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare your ball club to be as good as it can be , " Francona said . " There are a lot of different ways to do that : video , practice , statistical analysis for the coaches and me . The more ways you start looking at it , the more intrigued you get . " <p> Epstein consults with James , but perhaps as valuable are the opinions of Craig Shipley and Jerry DiPoto , recently retired major leaguers who now work for the Red Sox . Epstein will ask Shipley or DiPoto to look into a player 's character and consider those reports as well as James 's . <p> The Red Sox are not the only team with a statistical analyst , but as Lucchino said : " We do n't have a Bill James apostle . We have Bill James . " That illustrates the overriding belief in the Fenway offices : that by being smarter , working harder and thinking deeper , the Red Sox may have an edge . <p> " We 're not going to turn our backs on things in baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's an opportunity here to get a competitive advantage because the industry has done things the same way for 100 years . So we should take risks . " <p> Realism Replaces Love <p> The Rodriguez deal was a risk the Red Sox felt compelled to take . They wanted to trade outfielder Manny Ramirez to Texas for Rodriguez , swapping one long-term contract for another . Then , with Rodriguez on board , they would have dealt shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to the Chicago White Sox for another player in the final year of his contract , outfielder Magglio Ordonez . <p> The two-month saga ended with the Red Sox 's worst-case scenario : the talks became public , and the union rejected the team 's effort to restructure Rodriguez 's contract . The episode embittered Garciaparra and seemingly threatened the cohesiveness of the clubhouse . <p> But Red Sox officials say they prepared for that outcome . Garciaparra has always been skeptical of management , and his stoic personality had set him apart from the exuberant , head-shaving " Cowboy Up " gang of last fall . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way permanently bruised , " Lucchino said , adding later , " If anything , we have shown our fans our willingness to be bold and to shoot for the moon in terms of the way we run the franchise . " <p> Lucchino said the team still hoped to re-sign Garciaparra , whose agent , Arn Tellem , did not respond to an interview request . Henry praised Garciaparra 's character and seemed committed to keeping him . " I ca n't imagine winning a World Series without him , " Henry wrote . <p> But if the Red Sox do not win the Series this year , they could try it without several prominent players in 2005 . Outfielder Trot Nixon signed a three-year , $19.5 million deal Feb. 6 , but Garciaparra , Martinez , starter Derek Lowe and catcher Jason Varitek remain unsigned past this season . <p> Loyalty for past deeds will not guide the Red Sox in those negotiations . They will largely ignore sentiment , wary of being penned in by expensive deals to aging players . " You can not fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a real temptation to do that because you know them and your fans know them . But one of the prerequisites of the job is an ability to curb your affection for your veterans as they get further along in their careers . " <p> This may be the last chance for this group of players . But like the Yankees , the Red Sox now expect to make the playoffs every season . Once there , Henry said , every team has at least a 10 percent chance to win a title , while even the best team has no more than a 15 percent chance . Given those odds , he said , a team that reaches the playoffs every year will eventually win it all . <p> It is a typically analytical view from Henry . But if those odds come up Boston , there is nothing objective about his vision of what will happen . <p> " There will be the longest celebration in the history of baseball over a Red Sox world championship , " Henry wrote .
