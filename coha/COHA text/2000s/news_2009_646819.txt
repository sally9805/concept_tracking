PLYMOUTH , Mich.  --  Auto enthusiasts have been pawing the turf like corralled mustangs waiting for the revived Chevrolet Camaro , unveiled as a concept car at the 2006 Detroit auto show and finally in showrooms this week . <p> A day driving most versions on back roads and through the 25-mph villages around here was generally rewarding , suggesting the wait was worthwhile . <p> And a cheery note : The low-end versions , about $25,000 , arguably were the best of the bunch . <p> The Camaro is not as obsessively retro as the Dodge Challenger out last year or the current Ford Mustang . But using the popular 1969 Camaro as a touchstone , Chevy left no doubt it 's a modern take on Camaro 's heritage . <p> The Detroit coupes were known as " pony cars " in recognition that the Mustang was launched first , on April 17 , 1964 . As their makers crammed in ever-more-powerful engines , they also were called " muscle cars . " Of the three now , Camaro probably best blends old ( styling cues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base engine , modern suspension ) . <p> It 's unlikely Mustangers or Challenger folk will acknowledge Camaro as champ , but an open-minded shopper probably would consider Camaro most satisfying to drive , whether hard and fast or in the school drop-off line . <p> Chevy insists the Camaro is so modern it also will compete with Asian sports coupes such as Mazda RX-8 , Nissan 370Z and Mitsubishi Eclipse . <p> Showroom models went into production at Oshawa , Ontario , Canada , on March 16 and are trickling into dealerships now . Chevy says dealers have orders for 14,000 . <p> A main reason the lower-price models are so satisfying : The base engine is a sweetheart , not a wannabe . It 's the 3.6-liter V-6 Cadillac uses and has the latest technology , such as variable valve timing and direct fuel injection . The result is 304 eager horses that will satisfy most drivers . <p> Mustang 's base V-6 is just 210 hp ; Challenger 's 250 hp . <p> Couple Camaro 's V-6 to the standard Aisin AY6 six-speed manual with its forgiving clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rated at 29 miles per gallon highway and delivered mid-20s in vigorous testing . <p> The starter Camaro LS is about $23,000 , but it has steel wheels you probably do n't want . Stepping up to the 1LT for alloy wheels still leaves you a few hundred bucks shy of $25,000 . That 's the hot setup : 1LT V-6 , manual , alloy wheels . Way more than you expect for the money . <p> Chevy put stiff suspensions on all versions , for control in tight corners , emergency swerves and the like . But the result is lots of slam and slap over patched or otherwise unfriendly road surfaces . But  --  another reason to save your money  --  the 18-inch-diameter wheels on the low-end LS and LT are shod with softer-riding tires that wipe out the harshness . Those tires still are serious 245-55s , not some skinny fuel-savers . If you opt for the 19- , 20- or 21-inch wheels and tires , prepare for a rough ride . <p> All V-8s are designated SS ( Chevy 's " super sport " logo ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.2-liter V-8 's credentials , it 's not so with its real-world behavior . <p> Perhaps it accelerated so smoothly that it felt less than rocket-like from a standstill . The engine shone in the middle speed ranges , though . Nail the throttle to pass and , yowzah . Throaty , old-days exhaust sound , too . <p> Still , Challenger 's Hemi V-8 , while less powerful , is much nicer to drive than the robust Camaro V-8 . And the transmissions married to Camaro 's V-8 had their own shortcomings . The Tremec 6060 six-speed manual had a bit much of the " mechanical " feel enthusiasts love ; more like you were wrestling the lever instead of shifting it . And the clutch engagement was sudden , leading to jerky shifts . The V-8 's five-speed automatic upshifted fine . But nail the pedal while rumbling along and it felt like a manual with a slipping clutch . Lots of engine revs but little acceleration until , slam , everything hooked up . The automatics in the V-6 test cars had no such pause , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give Camaro independent rear suspension . The car does n't skitter sideways over railroad tracks like a solid-axle car such as Mustang might . Steering 's better ; ride and handling both are enhanced . <p> Gripes : <p> *Rear seat . Scarce room and awkward access . No tip/slide mechanism on either front seat , so one must separately tilt , then slide , a front seat . Cumbersome when you 're getting in , impossible when you want out . <p> *Steering wheel . The rim cross-section is a flat-oval shape that does n't fit everybody 's palm . <p> You have to pull the automatic 's shift lever on the console into the " M " mode and only then can you tap buttons on the back side of the steering wheel spokes to shift up or down . A better system would let you use the manual-shift buttons directly . <p> The M mode is useful by itself , however . It keeps the transmission in lower gears a little longer for much snappier response , though at the expense of fuel economy . <p> Camaro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to overlook the harsh ride , ridiculous back seat and transmission annoyances. 2010 Chevrolet Camaro <p> *What ?
