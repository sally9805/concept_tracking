Baker is situated in Pullman Valley , a twelve-mile pothole which was gutted into the modern-day corn belt by the glaciers of a preceding ice age . The western lip of the valley rises to 425 m above sea level , with the crowning limestone peaks on the northern end towering an additional 20 m over all the rest . Between this 600 yard escarpment and the treeless barrens to the northeast lies a maze of knobs and hollows , all thick with saw-briars , sassafras , dogwood and fool 's gold . Most of the soil is fairly worn , though it was once among the most fertile in the state . The summers are hot and long , the winters brief , yet occasionally brutal . Positioned at the northeast corner of the town line , almost perfectly centered in the valley  --  just south of where the Patokah river veers off from its course along the eastern wall and cuts in toward the community  --  lies Gwendolyn Hill , home to the Ebony Steed coal company and probably the greatest key in existence to Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that swept across the corn belt and brought towns like Baker alive with manufacturing plants , a Bostonian entrepreneur by the name of Glendan Castor moved into an old Antebellum home on the north end of town . Castor had purchased three square miles of land in Pullman Valley with the intention of founding a mining operation . It was a fundamentally sound investment , as the land was cheap and the availability of an expendable labor force seemingly inexhaustible  --  New England money goes a long way in the corn belt . However , what he did not foresee was the endless chain of complications that would come about as the result of his chosen site for operations . Had he known what lay beneath the surface of Gwendolyn Hill , he very well may have packed up and headed back to Boston straightaway . As it was , the establishment of the company was fraught with disastrous setbacks right from the beginning . Unbeknownst to all concerned at the time , Gwendolyn Hill had been the original site of an early European settlement/trading post , of which most existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been previously inhabited by a tribe of Shawnee Indians . In effect , this meant that encased in the hillside lay a scrap heap of Kentucky rifles , dead Indians , corroded whisky stills , sod houses , busted cooking utensils and grindstones , all of which were deemed archaeologically significant ' in contemporary legal terms . As standard governmental policy dictated , the discovery of any such find mandated that the respective bureau in the capital be notified at once , and that all operations be temporarily seized . A crew of archaeologists would then be sent in to pick apart the 1.5 mile reservoir with a fine-toothed comb . Which was all good and well for everyone concerned , except the coal-truck operators on unemployment . Castor 's original crew had unknowingly inherited a buried pig sty left behind by its forebears . If a white burial ground was unearthed , the church was called in to exhume the graves . That took two weeks . If an Indian burial ground was unearthed , the bureau of archaeology was deployed . That took up to two months . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each being the size of the average American home , were left unattended , lined up in a row like sick dinosaurs at a watering hole . Their operators filled the taverns , commiserating openly and drinking themselves blind . Before long , they 'd become an active public menace . Their behavior was frowned on all through the community . They themselves were miserable and bored . Knockdown brawls resulted . The whole crew was thrown in the county jail overnight on more than one occasion . And no sooner would operations finally get underway again than someone would churn up a section of an old stone wall during a munitions blast , landing everyone back in the bread line for another few weeks . Back to the taverns , back to the public charge . It became a serious problem . Castor 's operations started to falter . The company 's future was in jeopardy . Some of the operators walked off the job , and , contrary to the way it had been mapped out , they were no longer so easily replaceable . But the precarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon a routine blast turned up a fully intact , perfectly preserved , calcified skeleton of a grown wooly mammoth . The moment exhibit #1A , ' as it would later be called , appeared on the southern end of the main quarry , the coal-truck operators leapt out of their rigs and ran screaming along the ledge with their heads in their hands . They swore that was it  --  it was all over ; they would be shut down for the entire season this time . They stood in a flap-jawed row along the drop off , staring down at the half-submerged ribcage protruding from the gravel . Visions of terminal unemployment and public disgrace swept over them . It probably would 've been curtains for the entire company right then and there had one man not quietly stepped forward and told them all to keep their hats on . At the time , the head of the human resources department at Ebony Steed was a barrel-chested , charismatic graduate of the university of St. Louis by the name of Ford Kaltenbrunner . Kaltenbrunner , in his trademark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black tarp over the latest find , and instructed everyone to take a break . All eyes followed him as he made his way back up the embankment to Castor 's office-house . The outcome of the resulting conference was this : the company 's administrators unanimously concluded , under advisement from Kaltenbrunner , that it was high time Ebony Steed took a few basic matters into its own hands . In the interest of self-preservation and at the risk of crippling legal repercussions , it was thereby decreed that , from that day forward , all significant archaeological finds would be handled in a clandestine manner . Kaltenbrunner himself was appointed overseer of the coverup . Beginning with the latest discovery , all artifacts were to be recorded , dusted off , and turned over to him personally . He would then package the material with any pertinent information intact , and store it in a secret , well-concealed location where no one , including Castor , could get to it . The less anyone knew of its whereabouts , the more secure the coverup , it was reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was n't shut down once for the next eleven years . Kaltenbrunner , for his efforts , was promoted and compensated accordingly . He rose through the ranks of Ebony Steed and was soon second only to Castor himself , though in the eyes of the machinery operators he was clearly the most capable man in the company , bar none . He was widely respected and well-liked , seen as a fair man , a brilliant conversationalist , and one of the finest drinking partners this side of the cross . His sway over those around him was widely coveted . He was consulted for professional and personal advice on a regular basis . He was never known to turn down anyone in genuine need of his help . At the age of thirty-four he was married to an area seamstress of Welsh descent . He and his wife put a down-payment on an estate situated one mile due north of Gwendolyn Hill , just across the river . Ford set up a study in the attic of the farmhouse and soon lined the shelves with long rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library grew , as did his personal interest in the subject matter . The highly classified evidence from the mine was stored in a hidden location , the whereabouts of which not even Madame Kaltenbrunner was aware . Everything else remained in the attic . A growing collection of textbooks lined the lower shelves of the wall-mounted book rack positioned over the main desk . Information pertaining not only to the heritage and ancestry of the original inhabitants of Gwendolyn Hill , but also further analysis on the settlement and foundation of all of Baker : a chronological study of European migrations to the Midwest , the development of industry in the corn belt , the genesis of waterway navigation on the Patokah , the establishment of the railroads , pre and postwar farm production , the staggering effects of prohibition on a community of drunkards , barnstormings , cornhuskings , quilting bees , revivalism , wood-sawing contests , and even family charts on a good many of the town 's oldest residents . Exactly what he was working toward will remain a matter of conjecture , but the fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock on the local populace than anyone in history . At the age of thirty-eight , when he and his wife conceived their first child , Ford was at the height of his powers . Glendan Castor had become a washed out , embittered old ghost at Ebony Steed , little more than a peripheral reminder that , technically , there was still someone higher up on the ladder than Kaltenbrunner himself . With that in mind , it 's no wonder that Ford 's untimely demise , which was officially attributed to an explosion caused by a buildup of methane gas in one of the underground caverns , immediately prompted allegations of foul play all through the community . At 2:30 p.m. on Thursday , September 20 , 19 --  , every operator in reservoir number six heard and felt a sudden explosion where there should not have been one . They all left their rigs at once and began scrambling down the embankment to where an underground entrance lay sealed off by a large deposit of fallen limestone . They spent the rest of the day clearing the mess as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the body , it was too late . Ford Kaltenbrunner had been dead for hours . Madame Kaltenbrunner was said to have never gotten over it . She was six months into term at the funeral and stood in her black combination maternity/mourning garb with a thousand-yard stare roped off behind her drawn veil . She was in shock , they said . She barely looked up all through the service . Afterwards , she left the cemetery without a word to anyone . She spent the evening alone . She did n't appear for the memorial banquet at the American Legion . No one ventured out to the farm to offer his condolences . The coal-truck operators ended up in the gazebo at the town square after midnight , downing quarts of Kentucky bourbon and crying like children . Madame Kaltenbrunner was left to herself . Thereafter she became an acknowledged recluse . She was only sighted from time to time , moping into the grocery in her beige overcoat . Most locals swore she 'd lost her mind . She never remarried . Three months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaltenbrunner was born on the fifth floor of the Baker General . He was one week premature , weighed 7 lbs . 7 oz. , with sandy brown hair , and type O+ blood . He was released after two days under a vitamin lamp . He and his mother were sent on their way , back to the empty farmhouse on the north end of the valley . John was a sickly infant , prone to chronic respiratory infections and long illnesses . He was slight of build and somewhat awkward . He always seemed to be stumbling over himself , putting his nose where it did n't belong , prying into things . Madame Kaltenbrunner was as attentive mother as could be . She listened to old phonographs in the parlor while John crawled around on the kitchen floor , fidgeting with the padlocked solvent covers and cornering mice in the cracks in the wall . He once ate a wild mushroom in the yard and had to have his stomach pumped at the Baker General . Another time he fell from the porch and cracked his skull on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mother 's wagon on the way back to the hospital . He would later recall the mask coming over his field of vision like a plummeting scavenger as the doctors prepared to sew up his head . He instinctively detested the infirmary from then on . Outside of those two trips to the emergency room he had very little contact with the world beyond the farm for the first several years of his life . The only visitors Madame Kaltenbrunner ever entertained , or even allowed into the house , were a few of the coal-truck operators from the mine who evidently felt they were paying some kind of tribute to their deceased colleague by visiting his widow and bastard . They were enormous men with wooly faces , Texas-hog belt buckles and stale breath reeking of tobacco and sardines . They would remove their hats at the door and stand over John with an almost apologetic air of reverence and discomfort about them . They would inquire after Madame Kaltenbrunner 's financial situation , assuring her that if there was ever any problem with her life insurance benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk in the parlor , most of them would then take John for a ride through the backroads in their pickups . During these outings he was spoonshoveled numerous laudatory anecdotes concerning his father : his father the dragonslayer , his father the genius , his father the benefactor , his father the almighty , his father this , his father that  --  and what was more , he was assured , he himself would one day grow up to be a hard-driving , fueled , giant-killing sonofabitch as well . He 'd see ... After their visits , after they 'd rolled away and left him standing by the mailbox with his hands in his pockets , John was usually left at more of a loss than ever before as to who his father had actually been . He generally felt he 'd spent the afternoon hearing out long-winded , harebrained , entirely pointless confessions which had nothing to do with him . He never said much in response to anyone 's claims , and even after many visits over a period of several years , he still had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did , he could n't even remember their names . After some time the operators began to pick up on his confusion and wonder what was wrong with him . He was a strange one , they noticed  --  not much to look at . He was small for his age . He was never seen with any playmates . He seemed to be hopelessly preoccupied at all times , hell-bent on collecting his roadside bottles and tending to that shoddy flock of hens . He almost appeared mildly inconvenienced whenever one of them dropped by for a visit , as though he were actually being interrupted from more important matters . They could n't understand it . Was it possible that the most magisterial individual they 'd ever known had spawned a bad apple ? Could John , with his father 's blood coursing through his veins , really have been all that dim ? Eventually it was decided that , yes , he was . He was a cave fish . It was a terrible shame , but it could n't be denied . In time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits , John had gained no insight of any worth into his father 's character . And his mother had n't helped much either . The only time Madame Kaltenbrunner ever appeared to acknowledge Ford 's existence at all was during her occasional late-night scrapbook sprees , which left her slumped over a pile of yellowing photographs and crying into her milk of magnesia . Otherwise , she was stone-cold indifferent and , for appearance 's sake , a-sentimental . It was all a mystery to John . A long patriarchal shadow had been cast over him from birth , and from beneath its penumbra he could n't help but feel he 'd already been deemed inadequate somehow , that by not immediately following in the footsteps of his father , by not simply existing as an instant carbon copy of Ford Kaltenbrunner to begin with , he was letting everyone down . It left him at a complete loss . He found it hard to believe he was really expected to fill the shoes of someone he 'd never known , never seen , never talked to or met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a shell-shocked widow , a few dusty books , and an incoherent drove of bad mythology . To expect him to make heads or tails of this barrage of contradictory input , and then , on top of everything else , to become the next heir to the throne , was an honor he had not asked for and wanted no part of . Anyway , for all he knew his father may very well have been a complete idiot . Thus far he 'd seen nothing to indicate the contrary . In the first seven years of his life , he 'd seen nothing to live up to at all . If his father had once chosen to go out and play Lord of the hill people , that was just fine , so long as he himself was n't really expected to follow suit . He had no plans of ever becoming a miner . Even as a child , there were certain outcomes he would have banked on instinctively . Such as : he knew he would never be a university graduate , an athlete , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just the thought of all those possibilities was enough to make his stomach churn . They were worlds away , and that was for the better . He planned on keeping it that way . For those reasons , and possibly others , Ford Kaltenbrunner remained an abstract non-entity for the first twelve years of John 's life . The photographs depicting him as the vigorous , able-bodied coal kraut with the acute disposition and the all-consuming gaze gathered dust and cobwebs on the black-lacquered stool table in the hallway . His library went unattended . His name became an indeterminate household memory , a dwindling fixture . For John , his father was the former tenant for whom occasional scrap mail still arrived from time to time , the old man who 'd once lived in the attic , the one who 'd left behind the Winchester and the shack full of tools that came in so handy around the farm . The ornately framed photographs of him as the centerpiece in a rollicking , sweat-soaked bash at one of the local taverns were the same kinds that ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic , then anonymous nickel bins at farmers ' market and rummage sales , and ultimately forty feet deep in the landfill . The world abounded with them . The world went on without them . John walked right by them every day without looking . They were n't real . His father was a stack of mildewed books in the attic . He himself was too busy building an empire in the yard to pay them any mind .
