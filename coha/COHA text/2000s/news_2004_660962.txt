<p> I 'm instinctively wary of genetic engineering , but Karen Fowler may have produced a literary equivalent of the elusive Super Tomato . " The Jane Austen Book Club " is modern chick lit spliced with genes from 19th-century romantic comedy . In fact , Fowler has so craftily designed this new novel to appeal to smart , middle-aged , book-buying women that one regards its demographic precision cynically . I 'm sorry to report that it 's delightful . <p> Her leisurely story revolves around the monthly meetings of six people - five women and one man - who gather to discuss Jane Austen 's domestic romances . You do n't have to know Austen 's work to enjoy it , but if you 've read them , you 'll catch all kinds of witty parallels with the lives of these modern fans . <p> I would n't normally recommend this , but start with the appendix . Fowler 's breezy summary of Austen 's novels at the back is a good refresher for anyone who finds the details of " Mansfield Park " blurring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible pages of quotations about Austen 's work from critics and authors over the past 200 years , including some wry comments by Austen herself . Writing about " Emma , " for instance , she notes that her old friend Mr. Fowle " read only the first &; last Chapters , because he had heard it was not interesting . " Mark Twain fumes , " Every time I read ' Pride &; Prejudice ' I want to dig her up and hit her over the skull with her own shin-bone . " An early 20th-century critic observes that " the reputation of Jane Austen is surrounded by cohorts of defenders who are ready to do murder for their sacred cause . They are nearly all fanatics . " <p> Not all the members of the Jane Austen Book Club in this novel are equally fanatic , but they 're all equally engaging : <p> 1 . Their leader , Jocelyn , is a dog breeder who , like Austen , never married but approaches the affairs of others with the same deliberate planning she brings to the kennel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden agenda , but who , " they wonder , " would put Jane Austen to an evil purpose ? " <p> 2 . At 67 , Bernadette is the oldest member and , alas , the most talkative . She considers her countless marriages proof of her devotion to the institution . <p> 3 . Purdie is the only one married at the opening of the book , and she 's shocked to discover her fidelity tested by the hunky students in her high school French class . <p> 4 . Sylvia is trying to hate the cad who abandoned her after 32 years of marriage , but she 's not having much success . <p> 5 . Allegra , Sylvia 's lesbian daughter , is struggling to forgive a lover who betrayed her , and she 's succeeding too well . <p> 6 . Grigg , the eligible bachelor ( despite an alarming interest in science fiction ) , has been recruited to the group as a new partner for Sylvia , but fans of " Emma " can already guess how those plans go awry . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and yet everything happens . The chapters rotate through these six characters as they meet throughout the year , but while their meetings provide the skeleton , they 're not really the meat of the book ; in at least one chapter , we never even make it to the monthly meeting . Some of my favorite parts , though , are Fowler 's dead-on portrayal of book-club talk and the silent dialogue that rages beneath everyone 's efforts to be appreciative and encouraging ( no matter how boring or harebrained so-and-so 's comments are . ) <p> Although Fowler has a charming voice all her own , she 's managed to pick up Austen 's wry accent as she recounts the sad , funny , touching , and constantly entertaining experiences that have shaped these six readers . Much of the gritty details of modern life , of course , do n't appear in Austen 's fiction , and Sylvia notes that a person could be seriously misled by treating her novels as a road map of what 's ahead . ( One chapter , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the books of Jane Austen : locked-room murders , spies , cats ... " ) But even though Fowler has a thoroughly modern sense of contemporary sensibilities , she 's equally devoted to those old-fashioned ideals that virtue will eventually be recognized , love will finally prevail , and despair that threatens to settle in permanently can be dissolved by genuine affection . <p> Jane Austen does n't need a publicist , of course , and book clubs probably do n't need any encouragement , but Fowler has written a testament to the happy marriage of literature and friendship , and that 's always something to embrace . <p> Book clubs multiply <p> Although stores and publishers court book clubs in ever more inventive ways , there are no good statistics about the number of Americans who gather periodically in homes and libraries to talk about what they 've read . Even Robert Putnam , who managed to track the status of all kinds of social groups in " Bowling Alone , " confessed that when it comes to book clubs , " the numbers are a bit uncertain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , counts about 200,000 members in her online book club ( www.oprah.com ) . Houghton Mifflin published 700,000 copies of Carson McCullers 's " The Heart is a Lonely Hunter " in response to Oprah 's announcement last week that it 's her next choice . <p> Yahoo lists more than 1,200 reading-group categories , from the general ( " People who like books " ) to the specific ( " Sistahs who reside in the L.A. area . " ) . <p> Each month , 100,000 visitors come to The Book Report Network looking for information about how to start , maintain , and even feed a book club ( **26;1025;TOOLONG ) . The site 's main attraction is a collection of more than 1,300 reading guides , mostly supplied by publishers and authors . <p> Some publishers now bind these guides into their trade paperbacks when they sense the hardback has inspired major book-club interest ( e.g. " The Red Tent " ) . Remember , though , these guides are written by people who really want you to like and recommend their books . <p> Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading groups : " The Reading Group Handbook : Everything You Need to Know to Start Your Own Book Club " ( Hyperion , revised 1998 ) .
