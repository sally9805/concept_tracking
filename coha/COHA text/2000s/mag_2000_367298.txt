Trickle-down economics has not yet sunk to the places that the people in George Saunders ' fiction must , for want of a better fortune , call home . The hilariously hapless heroes of the six stories in Pastoralia ( Riverhead Books ; 188 pages ; $22.95 ) live as adults with their crotchety mothers or religiously obsessed sisters or a menagerie of squabbling relatives . The beleaguered breadwinner in Sea Oak works as a male stripper at Joysticks , a club with an aviation motif , and notes of his lodgings , " At Sea Oak there 's no sea and no oak , just a hundred subsidized apartments and a rear view of FedEx . " <P> The narrator of Pastoralia , the title story , has things even worse . He lives in a cave , albeit a fake one , that is an exhibit in a mysterious , at least to him , theme park . He and Janet , his cavewoman partner , are supposed to perform daily Stone Age tasks  --  cooking a goat , working on pictographs , grabbing and pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hardly anyone comes by to observe them anymore . The fax machine in the caveman 's private quarters spits out ominous messages from the park management : " Those of you who have no need to be worried should not in the least be worried . As for those who should be worried , it 's a little late to start worrying now , you should have started months ago . " <P> The characters in Pastoralia try desperately to clamber up out of their ruts . In Winky , Neil Yaniky goes to a local Hyatt to hear a self-help guru named Tom Rodgers tell the paying guests how to get other people to stop " crapping in your oatmeal . " Yaniky adopts the speaker 's recommended mantra  --  " Now is the time for me to win "  --  but ca n't muster the appalling selfishness to act on those words and kick his deranged sister out of his house . <P> A character in The Falls daydreams about the greatness that has somehow eluded him : " His childhood dreams had been so bright , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that he was a nobody , although , on the other hand , what kind of somebody spends the best years of his life swearing at a photocopier ? " <P> That concluding question typifies the sort of humor that Saunders consistently wrings out of his characters ' constrained existences . These losers are too self-aware to pity , and the world they perceive is unsettlingly familiar . Think TV ca n't get any more moronic ? Check out what Saunders ' people watch : How My Child Died Violently or The Worst That Could Happen , " a half-hour of computer simulations of tragedies that have never actually happened but theoretically could . " Ever felt that your job is the equivalent of a theme-park exhibit ? Pastoralia will not refute such subversive notions , but it makes them tolerably , screamingly funny . <P>  --  By Paul Gray
