<p> Time and time again , Ed Whitacre has seen something he wants . Then he 's gone to get it . <p> Even if you do n't know Whitacre 's name , you certainly know his company  --  AT &T.; In December , San Antonio-based AT &T; became the new owner of two Atlanta corporate giants : BellSouth and Cingular Wireless . With that deal , and with several others from the past , Whitacre has remade what was once Southwestern Bell into a company that reaches around the globe . <p> On Monday , Whitacre jetted to Atlanta for a private luncheon with a group of power players from Atlanta 's business and civic communities . He came at the invitation of outgoing BellSouth Chairman and CEO Duane Ackerman , who wanted to introduce local bigwigs to the man who holds vast sway over the fortunes of thousands of workers . <p> Whitacre also talked with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about a host of issues , in a rare interview since the BellSouth/Cingular deal was finalized in December . <p> Q : You 've just acquired one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cingular , which was a joint venture with BellSouth . What major parts of the transition are done and what key things remain ? <p> A : We 're trying to integrate the companies now , as you might guess . We 're trying to do a lot on brand advertising and on products that take advantage of AT &T's; name . <p> Q : Atlantans pride themselves on being a headquarters city . How much independence do you give your operations , or is control centered in San Antonio ? <p> A : There 's the right amount of control . It 's not over-control . Of course , Cingular  --  AT &T's; wireless division  --  is still headquartered here . This is the headquarters of the Southeast region telephone company . Nothing 's moved from here . <p> Q : AT &T; has said the old Cingular will stay in Atlanta for at least five years . Is that something that could change in the long term ? <p> A : At five years and one day , we wo n't be moving it . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our governor once pledged to press you to move from San Antonio . <p> A : He did . <p> Q : Is n't he a good salesman ? <p> A : No , he 's a great salesman . It just did n't make sense , with us established on the West Coast and the Midwest and some in the Northeast . We 're in the right location for the headquarters . <p> Q : Did he actually make a trip to see you ? <p> A : No , he called me and asked me if I would come see him . Which I did . I went out to his house , and he came in and strong-armed me . Not really  --  it was a very nice discussion . <p> Q : Did Mayor Shirley Franklin also call on you ? <p> A : I called on her , at her request . She 's a powerful lady . I came to visit her . <p> Q : Has every city you 've bought into lobbied you to come and be there ? <p> A : Um-hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you ? <p> A : Uh-uh . <p> Q : In buying BellSouth , what kind of company did you inherit ? <p> A : They 've grown , they 've got a great reputation . They offer a lot of innovative products . <p> Q : More top BellSouth executives left than stayed . Why ? <p> A : Well , you 'll have to ask them to find out the true answer . All were offered jobs . Some wanted to pursue new careers . Some wanted to retire . There 's a variety of reasons . Are we surprised by that exodus ? No . <p> Q : AT &T; has said that its head count will drop by 10,000 over a three-year period due to the merger . There 's naturally a lot of concern in Atlanta . What have you told employees ? <p> A : The normal attrition rate is well over 1,000 per month , with people retiring , quitting , moving on for whatever reason . ... There wo n't be any massive layoffs . There probably wo n't be any little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize in your BellSouth acquisition . But Verizon Wireless is a strong competitor and is better by some measures , such as lower customer turnover . What needs to be done at Cingular ? <p> A : Cingular President and CEO Stan Sigman says we 've got a network that 's equivalent to Verizon 's . You 're right , they 're definitely the cream of the crop . But he says we 're there . Now it becomes a question of executing a business plan . So I think we 're pretty close . <p> Q : Talk about choosing the AT &T; name . How much of that was based on research and how much was simply what you wanted to do ? <p> A : It 's some of both . You just ca n't operate with several brands in a business like ours . We 're not selling soap and perfume . We want people to know you can come to AT &T; and get anything you want , related to communications and entertainment needs . <p> Q : Ralph de la Vega took a new job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief operating officer . Stan Sigman is n't far from retirement . Who do you see running the former Cingular ? <p> A : I 'd say we have a lot of candidates , and you just mentioned one of them . <p> Q : So Ralph could come back ? <p> A : Absolutely . But do n't put him up for the job , because I do n't know . We 've got a lot of good people . Nobody 's indispensable . <p> Q : What does wireless-wireline integration mean for a consumer ? <p> A : Consumers should look for all of their communications to come from one company . It 's making all that work together in a simple way . <p> Q : How hard is it to pull that off ? <p> A : It 's hard . You can see some evidence of that now , with TV , broadband and wireless . You can see the Internet on wireless . You can slowly but surely see it integrating . Will it all get to one device ? I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Internet protocol television service , called U-Verse , to compete with cable . But you 're not in many cities yet . What kind of time frame do you have for more , especially in the Southeast ? <p> A : We 've taken some criticism for that . We 've tried to go slow , because it is a brand-new technology . We do n't have many customers now  --  four to five thousand . We 're going to ramp that up a great deal in the next month or two . We think we 've got most of the bugs out of the software . We 'll bring that same product to BellSouth . <p> Q : This year ? <p> A : Yes , we 'll have some markets here . <p> Q : I hear questions from average consumers about what 's going to happen to their bills . What should they expect ? <p> A : They should expect no change . We hope they buy more and the bill goes up . But we 'll have to see how good we are at selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> A : Hey , I 'm 65 and a half now . <p> Q : You got any big deals left in you , or is this the last one ? <p> A : I have no comment on that . This morning , right this instant , I do n't have any . <p> THE AT &T; EMPIRE <p> AT &T; is now a major employer and corporate player in metro Atlanta . Here are some details about its new role in the city : <p> * The company : Today 's AT &T; is the former SBC Communications . SBC grew from being a Baby Bell to an industry powerhouse .
