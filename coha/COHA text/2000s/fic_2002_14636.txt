Forest and city are two things essentially deep and this depth is fatally condemned to become a surface if it wants to be wound up like thread on the spool ( bottom ) of visibility.Here comes my messenger . How now , Mad spirit ? What night rules now about this haunted grove ? A forest is an island . This island is full of voices . Whispering voices . The wandering lovers and those they sought have turned into melancholy whispers . Whispers whispering . Whispered pledges and exclamations of desire and delight . They have lost their names . The rules of nomenclature . The rules of the upper world . All are gone . Misrule reigns , only the rules of misrule are a little unclear . Even to us.Forthere is no absolute clarity hereabouts anymore , as the woods have told me in their whispers ( Puck ) . No , comrade Elf , anything can be born from a union of two vocabularies when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , substances and stars must obey the prestige of their names . Then the lovers must surely have fallen in love with the wrong person . They do not follow the rule of love correctly . What is a rule ? A rule is that which one must follow in order to do a thing correctly . Nonsense , if I follow a rabbit that does not mean that I know what I am doing . A rule is something to eat . A rule is not something to eat . A rule is too something to eat . Glaring eyes . Horripilation . Something is skewed.We all live on the edge of what 's underneath . Do n't distract me . Our beautiful changeling girl has been acting strange . She has bopped Hippolyta on the head , and now the poor dear wants to return to Brazil , Who is from where ? I always get confused . Which is which ? Given the sleep of reason in these parts it is hard to say . Maybe Mad Daddy knows . Who ? The man who lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would approach he would get up and go . That man . Maybe we should capture him and force him to do something so as to reveal the deep . Deep . Deep structure governing all the rules . Misrules you mean . Idiot . Elfish dolt . Foliot ( what 's a foliot ? ) Larva . Larva ? Looks like a bug . Looks like the north end of something wiggling her hundred legged way south . You 'll break the bough . Bough break . Ho . Hoo . Ho ho . For now we see they are all sitting perched on boughs of a giant tree . This is Richard Doyle " The Fairy Tree " . Ungag Theseus and see what he says . Mad Daddy has misunderstood the play . Who ? Moon 's a platinum blond who has her nesting rights higher than us . Who has her nest in the woods . Who has her nest high in the trees . Her face 's on fire . I shall tell what my childhood was like.Gag him . Fool . He knows nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? About ? About ? Who the hell is she ? Whispers in his ear . One to the next till all the boughs rise and lower as the weight of knowing shifts his ( her ) weight from place to place . From point A to point B , say . She 's the new changeling from someplace in Pennsylvania. ? ! From where ? Skip it.So the facts are these . Theseus has been tied up with the thread he used to escape from the labernath . Labyrinth . From the labernath . No the play begins with the trembling French teacher and the story of the eating of Josephine by the . By that horrid girl in her frilled lizard form.Hippolyta . The play has already begun and the play has already not begun with . I want to go back to Brazil , among others of my kind . For I was cruelly kidnaped by this idiot ( Theseus ) . And I was cruelly kidnaped by him ( Theseus ) . Then by you . Puck has over thrown Oberon and Titania , and in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dragon whose rear part , commonly referred to as " tail " . A tail , in short . Was too too terribly long . Constituted a tail of inordinate length.What does she think we are ? Idiots ? A doubt is shared . Each to himself , in silence . Hippolyta . But I did not kidnap you . Oberon did , and others among the great elves . But now the lesser elves have overturned proper order in the pretty pastorale of Faery . Well , all I know is that , like , I am having a pretty hard time being a changeling . I am the changeling , not you . Are you calling me the replica ? I am the one taken , you are the lesser thing left in my place . I am the original . You are the replica . If I am the replica the replica is not a replica but a superior repetition . Ha ! A pathetic devolution . Nay ! A triumph of the evolutionary principle as as some wise men imagined it to be in Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are the parody , I am the original . If you are the original the original is a grotesque parody of something higher . Clearer . Brighter . More removed from what is low and grotesque and subterranean . Type , antitype ( I always get these confused ) , thesis , antithesis.An arboreal pause . A pause with a tail of inordinate length.Puck we are not so concerned about that part of the play . We are never quite sure who is who in the better class of Shakespearean fol-de-rol because the characters all talk funny and have Greekish names . The whole thing causes my head to split like a cracked nut . Like a cracked hazelnut ( Theseus ) . So we know all the doubled parts are played by one . This means you had better pack your bags . Do n't get me started again . We know the main story is of the double changeling ( and her changeling double ) who endeavors to return from the world she finds herself lost in , to the one from which she has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that there are certain rules to be followed in enacting the chiasmus , this capital X of double repatriation . And that such transformations may only be accomplished through divine ( infernal ) agency . And that after the restoration , according to rule , divine order is achieved and . And at the marriage of all three couples ( all throw not such nice glances at the speaker of this ) . Three ? I see only two . Points at the dead-locked changeling duo , far from being a couple . At the marriage or ( perhaps I mean ) beheading of Theseus a bad play is to be enacted during which a discussion of rules occurs among the philosophically inclined shadows.But how ? No one seems to know.In the forest you see there are lots of nasty little theaters . Only you have to know where to find them . And that is not so easy . And this is my story , the story of how I gave away not only my soul ( who needs a soul anyhow ? Quite a few important people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be more of an impediment to sure and rapid advancement to be burdened by such an antiquated thing , but no . Silence . ) No . No no no . I had given away my nature , which very much resembles the soul , but is altogether a different thing.Tripping devils and spitting-devils appear . You are not of the forest . We are . We know what nature is . Youdon't.Ah . Er . Ah . Reprise of the French language song.We notice or . Better , try not to notice that all the boughs of the fairy tree upon which the various elves are arrayed are actually folds of the tail of the dragon . A tail of , as by this time goes without saying , is . Is a tail of inordinate length.This being said . They present the play . Pause silence . pause . Only . Only nothing happens , er.They present the play . An embarrassed ( and embarrassing ) pause . Can it be that these creatures are unable to present the play ? Another pause , more argumentative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt with some awkwardness , given the arboreal nature of their local habitation , to confer.Ahem . They present the play . They , the Great Elf , the lesser Elf and other elves of diverse proportion.Something strange happens.All drop out of character , as if the picture of the world had been cracked open . They consider this idea.They look anxiously at the tied and bound Theseus , but no . He has not been beheaded , although we do notice something a bit odd.By Protector Puck 's knee there now stands a demented , gibbering Fairy-Feller with an axe . He stands there . He remembers to stop gibbering so that all may admire the magnificence and gibbosity of his dementia . All do this . Pause . Silence . Pause.The Frizzard steps forth . They do not present the play . They present Bottom 's Dream , the only part of the play that they understand . She 's shoved aside . We are presenting tonight Bottom 's Dream , the only part of the play that interests us . Squabble over a piece of food . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only part of the play that interests them . They , the Great Elf , the Lesser Elf and all the hideous and vulgar and . And plebeian less than Lesser elves . Elves of various and insignificant proportion , only.Only they do not know what a " bottom " is , since all things in the darkness of the woods and of the state of nature are au fond bottomless . This is the story of the Changeling Girl . And the story of Puck and the revolutionary power of his potion which has gone to all heads but his own . And the story of his most excellent speech . And the story of the man . The man called by some Mad Daddy . The man who lives in the middle of the forest.And the story of Wall . Pause . Silence . Pause@@ Blackout . We hear voices in the dark . Not very nice voices . Strange lights and shapes . Pause . Silence . Pause.We do not believe what you have been saying , you changeling , you . Why should we believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We. We do not do not know what a " bottom " is . But we do not think you do either . If I show you Bottom ? We do not believe you are capable of showing us anything . The changelings light twin candles . Okay okay . They snap fingers twice and far far away we see Mad Daddy approach . The one who is to play Bottom . As he approaches , quietly , the two changelings . We were more than one in our trial life ( la vie essayee ) . In our primative . Only through the accounts of others have we come to know our unity . On the thread of our history as told by others , year by year , we have ended up resembling ourselves . We gather all our beings radiance around the central unity of our name . Nicole . The demons confer in the dark . The man draweth nigh.He stops . Returns to one of the puddles of light through which he has passed . Ahem . We perceive a faint tremor . A faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tremor of pointed ears . An almost imperceptible vibration of terrible tails and three-toed claws . On the 28th of August 1843 , while under the power of Osiris , I stabbed to death a devil in the form of my father , whereupon I fled to France , and was apprehended there after once more attempting to rid this pleasant ball of earth of one more devil whereupon I was sent to Bedlam where I was confined for the remaining 42 years of my life.I was frequently given opium and worked slowly on my picture , " The Fairy-Feller 's Master Stroke " , of which this moment is a partial and incomplete . Replica . I shall play Bottom , as this dream is my dream.Puck . No need for opium here . Everything is a drug for the man who lives on the other side . Mad Daddy replies . The power of men 's imagination is more powerful than all other drugs . Puck , how about if Obergammerau and Titanium play Pyramus and Thisbe . We will play the lion , jointly . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps forth from the shadows . I am Ludwig Wittgenstein and I shall be enacting Wall , as the one who was to play that part one . One Josephine , has had a very serious accident . Puck . Fine fine . Let us , then , enact this three dimensional play in a forest that is the two-dimensional replica of the picture once painted by the mad man who sits just there . A mere social dot in the one-dimentional nest of his dementia . Who just sits there enacting nothing . The entire apparatus must be rotated from time to time in four-dimensional space . And if we participate in the enactment , are we to understand , that we will each be restored to our proper world wheresoever each may properly reside ? Pause.Silence . Maybe . Pause . Sup to Mad Daddy . The picture is his picture . Okay okay . Let 's begin the play . Only . Only what is the play called ? The play is called . Called.Ah.Er.The play shall be called Bottoms Dream . Stop . Why ? What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you say " Bottom " . Do you not remember ? We have just finnished telling you . Telling you in English and Finnish . Telling you that we do not know what a Bottom is , since all things in the forest are , au fond , bottomless . We do not believe you . know what you are doing when you say what you say . We are beginning to have doubts . Serious doubts.Okay . Okay They confer . The elves look about themselves and are bored and becoming irksome . Okay . Okay . The play shall be called . Called " The Lowest Part of Anything 's Dream ; or the Clue With Which We Wind Up Thread " . The elves confer . One of the most slow-witted of these . Well , what 's a clue ? A clue is like a spool . Like a spool ? Yeah , like a spool . Like a spool or the same thing as a spool ? They confer , realizing the gravity of the situation . The same thing as a spool . Elves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical machine open to reveal the play . The Fairy-Feller bops Theseus on the head , and the wondrous world of the play is revealed . Clouds and red velvet plush . Putti and an ornamental dragon with a tail of inordinate length . At the sight of this Mad Daddy rises to his feet with an astonished gasp.The changeling duet snaps fingers , and Titania and Oberon take the stage as Pyramus and Thisbe . As Pyramus and Thisbe they confer . One changeling . What 's wrong ? This floor is filthy . And there 's a dangerous nail-head here . Who 's the Equity Deputy ? The Fairy-Feller strides manfully out to the spot . He and the shadows examine the offending nail-head . The Fairy-Feller lays down his axe , and hammers the nail-head with his shoe till it is once more flush to the floor . Pause . The briefest of brief Equity breaks . The other changeling , looking at her watch . Okay okay . We 're back . Waits for actors . Elves to return . Okay . Okay , places . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my love . Oh Thisbe . Oh , Thisbe , true heart . Hey , where 's the Wall ? Wall ? Wall , where are you ? Wall has been sitting to one side quietly reading his book . Yeah ? Wall , you have to go on and stand between Pyramus and Thisbe . Pause . Why ? Because you are playing the part of Wall . The Wall has the task of standing in between the thwarted lovers . Another equity pause . Why ? If the lovers are thwarted why is wall even necessary ? Probably it is the case that one of the lovers does not know how to tell the other that he no longer loves her . No . No no no . The rule of the play is that the wall is what comes between them . And as you must surely know a rule is that which one must follow in order to do a thing correctly . Dimmest Elf . I thought a rule was something to eat . Another elbows him . Okay , if that 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another equity pause . Oh , Pyramus . Oh , Pyramus , my love . Oh , Thisbe . Oh , Thisbe , true heart. Wall . Perhaps all human needs can not be met . Perhaps we can not live forever . Perhaps we can not all.Wall , yours is not a speaking part . Your rule is that you are a mute , dumb . Wall . A wall-type wall . A wall . A solid thing . Okay okay . But if I am a solid thing how do Pyramus and Thisbe talk through me ? It does not seem believable to me that two lovers would try to express their love by talking through a wall . Have n't you read the Shakespeare version ? An anti-theatrical pause.No , I find his images unconvincing . I can never rid myself of the suspicion that praising him has been the conventional thing to do . Silence.Shakespeare 's similes are in the ordinary sense , bad . So if they are all the same good  --  and I do n't know whether they are or not , they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring of truth , and this gives them plausibility . I do n't know.Another anti-theatrical silence.My failure to understand him could then be explained by my inability to read him easily . That is , as one views a splendid piece of scenery.General exasperation . Look , Wall , the lovers talk through the wall because there is a hole . A hole in the wall . Now you are telling me there is a hole in the wall . That is correct now we are telling you there is a hole in the wall . Look , my contract clearly stipulates that I am to play " Wall " . There is nothing in this contract about playing both a wall and a hole in the wall . This violates a basic rule of things namely that a thing can not both be and not be . The truth consists of everything that is the case . The changelings confer . Elves grumble quietly and begin , singly , in pairs , and in small groups , to absent themselves from this felicity . The creatures begin to retreat deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silence . Pause . Pause.Okay . Have it your way . I shall play the hole in the wall . You shall play Wall . The Frilled Lizard shall play the lion all by herself.What kind of hole are you ? Are you an immaterial object or a superficial discontinuity ? What possible difference does it make ? Puck . Does the practice determine each rule throughout the whole of your Anything 's Dream ? Theseus . All that is needed to legitimize assertions that something means something is that there be roughly specifiable circumstances under which they are legitimately assertable , and that the game of asserting under such conditions has a role in our lives.Wall , agreeing . We may speak without " justification " ( Rechtfertigung ) ; but not wrongfully ( zu unricht ) . Changeling . Sometimes when she has a pain , it is I who feels it . This strikes me a deeply unfair . Hippolyta . One person in isolation can not be said to be following or not following a rule . That 's what they said to me when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ? Forty-two years in the bin has taken a toll on my poor wits.Puck . Community means following common rules ; insanity means following no rule . Like the narrative of this crazy dream . The two girls rage ( in silence ) and thrash about on the floor . Realizing the spectacle they are making , they cut it short , and tidy themselves up . Wall . That 's right . Agreement . Shared forms of life . If a lion could talk we would not know what it were saying . Changelings ROAR.Mad Daddy . Play 's over ! They play has just begun . When the lion roars , the play is over . Puck . But what ? What does the play mean ? Shadows settle in for the post-play discussion . What this play is all about is the deep deep deep structure of all rules . The dimmest elf . And what in the name of peaseblossom is that ? Mad Daddy . A ) The dragon 's tail is always longer than it looks . B ) There are more things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C ) Great Pan is dead . Now the Greater Elves begin to retreat , as steathily as possible.But what about us ? How are we to be restored to our respective domains ? Pause . Silence . Pause.Mad Daddy reasons . If this play follows according to rule ( and it must , must n't it , being a play qua play ? ) , order must already have been restored . One does not enact a bad play , even in the deepest of forests unless such a restoration has already come to pass . Puck . I would only suggest the problem may reside in your inappropriate observance of proper dress code . Puzzlement . If you two exchange costumes all will be as it was , or as it should seem . Or the other way around . Whichever . Where are you going ? Wall is going somewhere.Wall . Juoksentilisinkohan . Exit . Pause.What . What did he say ? He spoke the appendix to these proceedings . And the appendix is . If these rules be difficult to fathom , to get to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages . The Finnish . Because the Finnish is to the bottom as the Bottom is to the finish . Elves . Juoksentilisinkohan ! Which means ? Which means , I wonder if I should run around a little without a particular destination . The changeling duet do so , arm in arm , and disappear into thenight.Puck . Now is time the crack open the hazelnut . Theseus shudders in terror.The Fairy-Feller raises his axe.Blackout.A loud crack.Lights up on scene as the cast enacts the complex mise en scene of Richard Dadd 's painting , " The Fairy-Feller 's Master Stroke " , while he watches , off to one side , sitting on Wall 's former stool . All sing a slow reprise of the French language song . Pause . Silence.All go out leaving only the smallest , dimmest elf . He looks around and , quaveringly , sings his own song . Silence .                                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
