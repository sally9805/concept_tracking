The regulars are gathered around the bar at Our Place , drinking cold colas to slake the Mojave Desert 's midday parch , when somebody finally brings up the subject on everyone 's mind : Erin Brockovich . " I remember the night the real Erin Brockovich walked in here , " recalls bartender Lynn Tindell . " She was strutting her stuff . She knew all the guys were looking at her . " Brockovich , as anyone who has seen the movie knows , was the sexy single mom who helped the residents of Hinkley , Calif. , win a record $333 million settlement against Pacific Gas &; Electric for contaminating their well water with toxic chromium VI . Then , like a true Cinderella , she sold her story to Hollywood . Happy ending ? Not quite . " Good movie , " says Lynn Morris from one end of the bar , " but they 're making millions , and we 're still dying out here . " <P> Last week the film passed the $100 million mark in box-office receipts , and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her uplifting role as the gutsy and busty Brockovich . But in Hinkley , plenty of people are angry over Erin , which they feel portrays the lawyers as white knights and the townspeople as a bunch of hicks . Residents are angry because , while the movie makes it seem that justice was done , in fact only 600 of the town 's 1,000 residents won a money award . They are also peeved because the movie 's success has scared off potential home buyers and made it difficult for residents to get health insurance . Another sore point : most of the movie was filmed in nearby Boron , not Hinkley . <P> Such are the dangers of taking real life to the screen . Controversies over fact-based movies like The Hurricane , Boys Do n't Cry and The Insider have got big ink in the past year , but Erin Brockovich 's problems slid by almost unnoticed . Residents who received settlements back in 1996 were sworn to secrecy as part of the agreement , but now their sick neighbors are piping up . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Give me a break ! What s ! They depicted the lawyers as so concerned about the residents , " says Diane Zuniga , whose mother got $40,000 in the lawsuit but whose father , brother and sister got nothing , despite what Zuniga says were equally serious health problems . " Does Brockovich really care ? I do n't know . I just know I want enough money to get this crap out of my body . " <P> Brockovich and her boss , Ed Masry ( played by Albert Finney in the movie ) , are preparing to go to trial again in November against PG &E; on behalf of 140 more Hinkley residents and a group of victims in nearby Kettleman City . So many are seeking to be part of a third lawsuit  --  800 in all  --  that Masry is turning people away . Hinkley resident Susan Cordova , who claims the hysterectomy she had at 28 was necessitated by the chromium contamination but has twice been turned down by Masry , says lawyers in Los Angeles ( one of whom was portrayed by Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " ashamed " for complaining since her health problems were n't life-threatening . ( The lawyers deny having said this . ) Masry and Brockovich did n't take Thelma Hunter 's case either , though she has cancer of the right kidney and a shoulder eaten away by disease . Or Tom Owens ' , with his cancerous tumors . " Most of us got screwed , " says Lynn Morris . " We did n't know about the original lawsuit . Only a little clique knew . "
