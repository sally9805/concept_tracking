From a rolling repair school and his cinder-block shop , Les Welch teaches and preaches maintenance . WRENCH // Why We Love Him : After 15 years as a mechanic , Les Welch , now 51 , helped found a bicycle-repair school in Virginia 's Shenandoah Valley , where he grew up , in 1987 . Today , the East Coast Bicycle Academy is more shop than school , though Welch still teaches customers , bike cops and EMTs , and serves as an adjunct professor of mountain bike repair at nearby Garrett College . " I sell bikes , " he says . " But my passion is repair-real repair , not just changing an old component for a new one . " In the Shop : You 'll find boutique brands such as Independent Fabrication ( " Matt Bracken , the company president , is one of our alumni " ) , Landshark and Calfee , plus plenty of spare and vintage parts for tinkering .

" On the Road : Welch keeps a complete repair school out back in a 16-foot trailer , with tool boards , workstands , truing stands and eight repair benches . " I drive the school to wherever I need to teach , " he says . He also spends 75 days per year working as the chief of mechanics for Ironman triathlons . His Stoker : While Welch is away , his general manager , Taz , runs the shop with the same care , and is happy to tell you about the wheels she rides ( she built them herself ) , her tandem escapades with her teenage son , and the latest from the local off-road motorcycle circuit , in which she 's a top racer . Tinker Toy : Welch 's favorite tool is a pair of chrome-plated miniature Craftsman pliers with offset alligator jaws . " They belonged to my dad , " who was a self-taught mechanical genius , he says .

Maintenance Tip : Check for bearing play in your headset , wheels and cranks . " It 's one of those things that , if neglected , turns a simple adjustment into a major replacement , " says Welch . To check headset bearings , " squeeze the front brake and rock the bike fore and aft , " he says . For wheel and crank bearings , pull the wheel or crank side to side .
