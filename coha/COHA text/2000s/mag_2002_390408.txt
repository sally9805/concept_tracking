Why some germs may be good for your child 's health // EMMA DONAHUE , 2 , ENJOYS LIFE ON HER FAMILY 'S FARM . She loves to touch the menagerie of animals-and pick up the feathers and other " treasures " they leave behind . " I 'm not the type to get stressed out over dirt . That takes a lot of the fun out of being a kid , " says her mom , Stacey , of Lithia , Florida . " I just tell Emma not to put her hands in her mouth until we can wash up . " Emma 's early exposure to old-fashioned muck , with its cornucopia of germs , may be just what the doctor ordered-at least according to the " hygiene hypothesis " and a growing number of studies that support it . The crux of the theory : The modern war on germs may have gone too far , wiping out too many of the good guys along with the culprits that cause diseases . Exposure to certain bacteria in the first years of life is crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe . Without this early training , the imbalance within the body 's immune cells may predispose them to attack a host of harmless substances , such as cat dander and pollen-or even other cells in the body . Photograph Bursting the hygiene bubble : Kids do n't always need to be Squeaky-clean // That immune-system immaturity may be a major contributor to one of the most perplexing public  --  health problems our country faces : the increasing number of kids who are suffering from childhood allergies , asthma , and eczema . " The hypothesis is a leading theory to explain things like rising rates of these illnesses , " says Richard Johnston , M.D. , a member of the Institute of Medicine and a pediatric immunologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine , in Denver . Many experts are also investigating possible links to adult autoimmune diseases , such as diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and lupus . It 's time to rethink our efforts to wipe out every microbe that comes near us . Some of those germs might actually be good for our kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in the myth that we would want to live in a germ-free world , " says Graham Rook , M.D. , an immunologist at the Royal Free and University College Medical School , in London . " Lab animals raised in a genuinely sterile environment develop abnormal immune systems . " Indeed , a typical adult human houses trillions of bacteria in his intestines . These normal gut " flora " aid digestion , produce such nutrients as vitamin K and certain B vitamins , and play a long-recognized but little-understood role in the operation of the immune system . Even our skin is replete with harmless bacteria so deeply embedded you could never scrub or sanitize them away . Nor would you want to : These skin germs serve as a barrier against harmful stray bacteria that might otherwise take up residence there .

Just make sure you use an alcohol-based cleanser rather than an antibacterial one . * " At our house , we 're big fans of the " five-second rule .

My wife and I just nodded politely without mentioning that we had n't boiled a bottle since we first bought them . Hot , soapy water does the trick for us. " - Butch Kinemey , South Riding , VA ; dad of Judiciaire , 2 Experts say : As long as your tap water is chlorinated , it 's fine just to wash the bottles and nipples , preferably in a dishwasher , which gets hotter than most sink water . Well water ? You 'd better boil " em . // Of course , no one is claiming we should n't protect ourselves against illness . Or return to the days before water treatment , antibiotics , and vaccinations largely wiped out scourges like cholera , tuberculosis , and polio . " Rather , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've taken away something that the immune system needs to program its early development , " says Dr. Rook . Scientists are n't yet certain how the process works , but they believe specific microbes switch on cells that then suppress a reaction against allergens and beneficial bacteria . They point to numerous studies that show that allergies and asthma occur less frequently among children who : * have older siblings ( think walking germballs ) * spend time in daycare in the first year or two of life * have early exposure to pets or farm animals * live in rural parts of the country or in areas of the world that lack modern sanitation . The good news : The organisms that babies and toddlers need to encounter in daily life to develop healthy immune systems are n't the kinds that make us sick . Instead , the common denominator among older siblings , daycare , animals , and rural environments appears to be the largely harmless bacteria found in dirt , mud , puddles , and ponds . ANTIBIOTIC OVERKILL ? The hundreds of antibacterial products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap to toys and even sneakers-may be making the problem worse . " If our past experience with overuse of antibiotics is any guide , these items could do more than eliminate good germs , " says Tufts University microbiologist Stuart Levy , M.D. , author of The Antibiotic Paradox . " They 're likely to encourage bacterial resistance to these products-and to antibiotics . " Some of those newly resistant bacteria could cause illness . Echoing Dr. Levy 's concerns , the American Medical Association recently urged government regulators to speed their review of antimicrobial agents in consumer products to determine whether they actually pose a threat . ( Manufacturers of these products defend them as beneficial , pointing out that they can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria , including salmonella and E. coli , that cause intestinal illnesses , skin infections , and other unpleasant-and in some cases fatal-diseases . ) The alarm first sounded in 1998 , when researchers at Tufts University discovered that triclosan , the active ingredient in most antibacterial cleansers , works more like an antibiotic drug than a disinfectant . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triclosan blocks a specific enzyme that germs need to survive . The trouble is , microbes are infamous for developing ways around such narrow modes of attack . Triclosan also lingers on such surfaces as tubs and kitchen counters for days , even weeks , which gives bacteria plenty of time to develop resistance . While critics counter that no one knows whether any of this poses a real problem , many microbiologists believe that it 's not worth taking the risk , especially given that the only place triclosan and other similar products have been proven to reduce the spread of illness is in hospitals , where workers scrub their hands and douse surfaces for 5 to 20 minutes-not the mere seconds most people spend on such activities . A HEALTHIER KIND OF CLEAN So what should you do to give your child 's immune system a head start , without going overboard ? Experts-even those who are n't sold on the hygiene hypothesis yet-agree that taking the following easy steps is wise : WIDEN YOUR CIRCLE If your child 's not in daycare and does n't have an older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other kids-and their germs . You might join a playgroup or sign her up for Mommy and Me classes once or twice a week . But do n't purposely expose her to people who are sick-those are not the type of bacteria she needs . DO N'T RELEGATE YOUR PET TO THE BACKYARD It 's fine to have a gentle pet in the same room with your baby . ( But not if your child 's already developed an allergy to animals-in that case , isolating the pet from bedrooms , or even finding it a new home , may be called for . Once an allergy develops , exposing a child to the allergen only makes things worse . ) HEAD OUTDOORS Because good bacteria are found in soil and natural bodies of water , families who enjoy gardening , camping , a day at the lake , or trips to the country should n't be shy about including their youngest one in the fun . STICK WITH YOUR TRIEDAND-TRUE CLEANERS The best antibacterials are the oldfashioned ones , says Dr. Levy . That includes bleach water ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like Comet or Bon Ami ) , alcohol ( either isopropyl or ethyl alcohol ) , or hydrogen peroxide . It 's also smart to open windows to bring in fresh , clean air . Recent warnings about the dangers of triclosan have spurred new antibacterial cleaners and lotions labeled " alcohol- and triclosan-free . " But take care : These often use triclosan 's close cousin , triclocarban , a compound that is thought to work in essentially the same way , so check the ingredients . If you must use these or other antimicrobial products , do so sparingly  --  only when cleaning up after cutting raw meat or poultry , for example , or if someone living in the house has a medical condition that leaves him susceptible to infection . DO N'T ENCOURAGE GERMOPHOBIA Of course , parents mean well when they disinfect playground equipment or insist that kids stay away from yucky , dirty mud . But doing so may pass on some unnecessarily scary ideas about the world . Instead , try to give your child the freedom to explore his environment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he starts refusing to touch things , washing excessively , or asking fearful questions about dirt and grime , look hard at the message you 're sending . It may be that in the end , the best way to give our kids a healthy attitude about germs-as well as a strong immune system-is by trying not to protect them too much . a Photograph When Soap Is Essential Some germs still pose serious health risks , so it 's smart to be vigilant about the following : The Kitchen * Raw poultry and hamburger are often contaminated with harmful bacteria , including salmonella and E. coli , so wipe surfaces they 've touched with paper towels and a bleach-based cleanser , and dice fruits and vegetables on a different cutting board . When you barbecue , do n't put cooked meats on the same platters you used when they were raw . * Use sponges on dishes-not on tables , countertops , or floors , where they can pick up unpleasant bugs that thrive in moist crannies . Once a week , microwave the sponge for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grungy. * All family members should wash their hands before touching any food . All it takes is 30 to 60 seconds of sudsing with plain soap and warm water-tell kids to lather for as long as it takes to sing the ABC 's . Do n't dry your hands on the same towel you use for dishes . Always wash your hands after handling raw poultry , fish , meat , or eggs . The Grocery Store Salmonella lurks , thanks to leaky chicken packages . So use the plastic bags In the produce aisle to pick up poultry-and do n't let your baby mouth the cart handle ! Colds and Flu If your child Is sick , ask him to wash his hands frequently ( once an hour is ideal ) , try to avoid touching other members of the family , and sneeze and cough into a tissue  --  or , in an emergency , in the crook of his arm-instead of his hands . There 's no need to go around sterilizing door  --  knobs , but remind other family members not to touch their eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containers . When your little one is better , buy him a brandnew toothbrush . - NICHOLE CIPRIANI Author Affiliation JESSICA SNYDER SACHS , a PARENTING contributing editor , wrote about vaccine safety in the April issue . // <p>
