<p> WHAT a sight it would be . What a traffic jam it would create . <p> Take all of the pitchers who changed teams this winter and tell them to report first to their former teams ' training camps . Then at an appointed hour , they are to leave those camps and drive to the camps of their new teams . The vehicles would be whizzing all over Florida and Arizona this week as pitchers report for work . <p> Spring training already ? It seems like only yesterday that the Boston Red Sox were about to be swept by the Yankees but instead went on an unprecedented eight-game winning streak and became World Series champions . Considering that it was their first World Series triumph in 86 years , ca n't they have a little more time to savor it ? <p> Well , maybe not . So much of the team is scattered that players would have to savor it on their own . Look at the pitchers who started games against the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals . Two pitchers , Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 games will be elsewhere this week , Martinez with the Mets , Lowe with the Los Angeles Dodgers . In their place : David Wells , Matt Clement and Wade Miller . <p> The Yankees also have a largely reconfigured starting rotation . Jon Lieber , Javier Vazquez and Orlando Hernandez , who started five of the Yankees ' 11 postseason games , are gone . Randy Johnson , Carl Pavano and Jaret Wright will be in Tampa , Fla. , in their place , while Lieber will be with Philadelphia , Vazquez with Arizona and Hernandez with the Chicago White Sox . <p> To put the moving pitchers in a larger perspective , 30 of the 68 pitchers who started last October 's 34 postseason games  --  44 percent  --  were free agents this winter . Seventeen starters who won 10 or more games in 2004 have changed addresses for 2005 . The biggest names are Johnson , Martinez , Mark Mulder , Tim Hudson and Pavano . Johnson , Pavano and Martinez will pitch in New York , Mulder in St. Louis and Hudson in Atlanta . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winners the Braves let leave as free agents , Wright and Russ Ortiz . The other replacement comes from within . Instead of signing or trading for another starter , the Braves acquired a closer , Dan Kolb , in a trade with Milwaukee , enabling them to restore John Smoltz to a starting role . Smoltz has been the team 's closer the past four years . <p> Although some of the pitchers  --  primarily Johnson , Mulder and Hudson  --  were traded , most of the moving pitchers changed teams as free agents . It happens every winter , but it happened in greater numbers than usual this winter . <p> " Why did so many pitchers go out on the free agent market this year ? " Milwaukee General Manager Doug Melvin said , repeating a question . " Probably because their teams did n't think their value was that high . But it turned out that it was . " <p> Contracts for pitchers raised eyebrows because they raised salaries so significantly . The Mets were generally blamed for setting the market high by re-signing Kris Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free-agent signing period . But even if the Mets overpaid for Benson , other teams did not have to follow . <p> Asked about that development , Washington Nationals General Manager Jim Bowden said : " They do n't have to follow . We did n't . Odalis Perez would have come here had we stepped up . If we had paid close to Benson and close to what Eric Milton got , Odalis would have been a National . But we did n't . We walked away . We did a lot of walking away . Just because there 's one or two bad signings , we do n't have to do it . " <p> Perez , after rejecting the Nationals ' three-year , $18 million offer , went back to the Dodgers for a three-year , $24 million deal . <p> " The agents held out and got what they wanted , " Bowden said . <p> Some team is usually willing to pay more . Before making some of their pitching moves , the Yankees negotiated with Milton , offering him $18 million for three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up signing with Cincinnati for $25.5 million , an uncharacteristic expenditure for the Reds . <p> Time Served <p> With Barry Larkin having presumably finished his career in Cincinnati , Craig Biggio ( Houston ) and John Smoltz ( Atlanta ) will become the active players with the longest continuous major league service with one team . <p> Larkin played for the Reds for 18 years and 54 days ( a major league service year is 172 days ) . Biggio has played for the Astros for 16 years and 99 days , Smoltz for the Braves for 16 years and 72 days . <p> Bronx Bound <p> For years , George Steinbrenner , the Yankees ' principal owner , bad-mouthed the Bronx as a dangerous place to go to a baseball game . Never mind that on game days the Yankee Stadium area was so loaded with police officers that it was the safest spot in the city . <p> Steinbrenner 's warnings had an effect on attendance . If the chairman of General Motors said his company 's cars were not safe , would you buy a Buick or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees drew 2.25 million fans . Their season record was 2.6 million in 1988 . But with four World Series championships in five years , the Yankees made it fashionable to go to their games . Steinbrenner stopped squawking , and the fans started flocking . <p> Last year , their sixth straight above 3.2 million in attendance , they drew a record 3,775,292 fans . As ticket sales wound down last week , the Yankees had sold 2,527,901 tickets for the coming season , putting them about 340,000 ahead of last year 's ticket sales at this time of year . <p> If they maintain that pace , they will hit four million for the first time . <p> Leiter : Come On Down <p> Jeffrey Loria , the owner of the Marlins , put his money where Al Leiter 's mouth was last month . This is how Florida got the free-agent first baseman Carlos Delgado , Leiter said , " I told him to join us if he wanted to be on a better team , a winning team , a team that has a lot of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida , an hour and a half from San Juan . " <p> Leiter , a new pitcher for the Marlins , also told Delgado , a native of Puerto Rico , that the Mets and New York were not the only team and place that could offer a diversified fan base . <p> " You talk about Latin influence ; you ca n't get any more Latino than South Florida and South Beach , " Leiter said recently . <p> Leiter said a major point he made to Delgado was that slumping in Miami would be no big deal . In New York , it is material for bold headlines . <p> " You 're not going to deal with the craziness of the media and all the little brush fires that happen periodically , " Leiter said . " Whether true or not . Whether rumor or not . " <p> Leiter said the Marlins can compete financially with the Mets and the other teams that pursued Delgado with the help of a new stadium . <p> " The stadium is huge , " Leiter said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new stadium next to the Orange Bowl that 's fabulous . It 's going to be a wonderful stadium . They 're crossing the t 's and dotting the i 's now . <p> " It will be done in a way that Loria will lose some money for a couple of years . But he 's a huge baseball fan . He impressed the heck out of me when he told me before I signed exactly when my first appearance was for the Yankees in 1987 . Who it was against . He knew incidents within the game . " <p> Loria also knew how to spend for Delgado : $52 million for four years . <p> Lohse Living Large <p> Once upon a time , a player had to produce a good record to get a raise . That idea has gone the way of the Sunday doubleheader . <p> Kyle Lohse , a 26-year-old Minnesota pitcher , had a 9-13 won-lost record and a 5.34 earned run average in 34 starts last season . An arbitration panel heard his case last week and set his salary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contract the previous two years apparently helped more than his pitching performance . <p> Lohse , who had a $395,000 salary last year , won his bid for $2.4 million , more than a 500 percent raise . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com ( Photo by Vincent Laforet/The New York Times ) ( Photo by Richard Perry/The New York Times ) ( Photo by Barton Silverman/The New York Times )
