Marc Rich trades nearly every plant , mineral and fuel that can be taken from the earth and turned into profit . He does it on such a grand scale that his trades actually affect how much Americans pay for a slice of bread or a light bulb . " Some say he is the greatest trader since Moses made a deal to part the Red Sea , " says biographer A. Craig Copetas , a Wall Street Journal reporter . When Clinton pardoned Rich last month , it was yet another deal  --  a business problem that took 18 years for Rich to solve . <P> Before the pardon , Rich appeared to have it all  --  a mansion in a Swiss village , a global business and a helicopter to take him skiing where no lift could reach . But if he left Switzerland , Israel or Spain , he risked getting bounced to New York to face criminal tax-evasion charges from 1983 .
