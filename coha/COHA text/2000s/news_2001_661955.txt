The papers found that Gore 's name was marked on overvotes far more often than Bush 's name . <p> An undervote is a ballot on which no mark or punch for president registered ; an overvote is a ballot on which more than one mark or punch registered . <p> More than any other conclusion , the review showed the depth of voter confusion , the newspapers said . <p> " Ultimately , the lesson is the system we had in place caused so many people to misvote that the real result of the election is n't known , " said Doug Pardue , projects editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Herald , the review was sponsored by the Herald 's parent organization , Knight Ridder newspapers , and six other Florida newspapers : the Tampa Tribune , the Tallahassee Democrat , The Bradenton Herald , Florida Today , The News-Press of Fort Myers and the Pensacola News Journal . <p> The papers agreed there were 111,261 overvotes , although the Herald said it examined 64,826 undervotes , while USA Today put the figure at 60,647 . But the papers agreed on the final results of the analysis . <p> Last month , relying on accountants to review just the undervotes , USA Today and the Herald reported that Bush would have won Florida under nearly every scenario had the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a statewide hand recount to be completed . <p> In the latest review , the papers relied on reporters to examine the overvotes and found that 97 percent were marked so badly that no clear intent could be discerned . <p> Most of the remaining 3 percent , or 3,146 ballots , bore markings that made it clear who the voter preferred . Generally , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write-in vote for that same candidate . <p> Most of those recoverable overvotes - 1,871 - were for Gore . Bush received 1,189 such votes , and 86 went to other candidates . <p> Gore wound up with a net gain of 682 votes from overvotes , leaving the outcome of any review up to the standards used when examining punchcard ballots with their infamous hanging chads . <p> With the strictest standard , the papers said , Bush would have won with 407 votes , fewer than the official 537-vote margin that gave him Florida 's 25 electoral votes and the presidency . <p> With the most lenient standard - one that counted any dimpled ballot as a vote - Gore would have won by 332 votes , the newspapers reported . <p> " So what has changed ? " said former Montana Gov . Marc Racicot , a Republican . " The only count that really counts is the one conducted under the rule of law . " <p> For Democrats , the results confirmed their suspicions . <p> " These numbers certainly back up our feeling that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Doug Hattaway , a former Gore campaign spokesman . " It 's hard not to cringe when you think about the possibilities . " <p> A group consisting of The Associated Press , The New York Times , The Washington Post , CNN , The Palm Beach Post , St. Petersburg Times , The Wall Street Journal and Tribune Publishing , whose newspapers include the Chicago Tribune , Los Angeles Times , Newsday , Orlando Sentinel and the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , is analyzing all uncounted presidential ballots cast in the Florida election . <p> Though the USA Today and Herald study found Gore might have won a narrow victory if lenient standards had been used , it also showed that Gore could not have won without a hand count of overvote ballots throughout the state . <p> Early in the post-election struggle , Gore chose not to ask for an official statewide review of every rejected ballot - both undervotes and overvotes . Instead , he requested a recount only in four counties . <p> But if Florida 's new election law had existed last November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> NEWSPAPERS : <p> Philadelphia Daily News and Inquirer to cut 200 jobs <p> PHILADELPHIA ( AP ) - The publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News plans to cut 200 jobs , or 6.4 percent of the newspapers ' work force , by July 1 . <p> Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. initially will offer voluntary buyouts and early retirement packages but will turn to job eliminations and layoffs if necessary , Publisher Robert J. Hall said . <p> Hall told managers on May 11 that the company this year will see the largest year-to-year drop in advertising revenue in its history . He also cited sharp increases in newsprint costs . Both factors have been cited by many other newspaper publishers that have announced cuts . <p> The reductions will have " minimal impact " on the papers ' content , Hall told the Daily News . " We hope to maintain the same quality that we have now . " <p> Last month , Knight Ridder , the San Jose , Calif. - based parent company of the Inquirer and Daily News , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job reductions . <p> Other Knight Ridder newspapers to announce job cutbacks include The Kansas City Star , which is eliminating 6.7 percent of its work force ; the Saint Paul Pioneer Press , 10 percent ; the Grand Forks ( N.D. ) Herald , 13 percent ; and The Charlotte ( N.C. ) Observer , 3.5 percent . Knight Ridder executives have not said how many jobs will be cut companywide . <p> Henry J. Holcomb , president of the Philadelphia local of the Newspaper Guild , sent an e-mail on May 11 to staffers outlining the separation packages offered to nonunion workers . The package could pay them up to a year 's salary and a one-time bonus of $ 20,000 , depending on length of service , Holcomb said . <p> &gt;+++++ Mercury News and former columnist settle charges <p> SAN JOSE , Calif . ( AP ) - The San Jose Mercury News and a former columnist who was demoted after trading stock in a Silicon Valley company have settled charges she brought against the paper . <p> Chris Nolan had filed a labor grievance and sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , were not disclosed . <p> In 1999 , Nolan bought 500 shares of Autoweb.com at the initial offering price under a " friends and family " allotment not available to the public . Nolan , a friend of the company 's CEO , eventually sold her shares and made about $ 9,000 . <p> Nolan said she had told editors about the deal before and after she sold the stock , and no one disapproved . After The Wall Street Journal reported on the trade , Nolan was demoted and accused of violating the paper 's ethics policy , which prohibits business reporters from investing in local companies . <p> In a joint statement , Nolan and the newspaper said : " The Mercury News strives to adhere to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct and recognizes that Ms. Nolan does as well . Ms. Nolan is grateful for the opportunity to have worked for the Mercury News and has nothing but good wishes for the future prosperity of the paper . " <p> Nolan filed a grievance against the Mercury News with the San Jose Newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration . <p> The settlement also resolves sex discrimination charges she had filed against the paper with the state Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . Nolan contended that male columnists were paid more and were given more outside speaking opportunities . <p> Nolan , 41 , eventually left for the New York Post , where she now has a Silicon Valley column . <p> &gt;+++++ Boston Globe halting weekly New Hampshire section , closing bureau <p> BOSTON ( AP ) - The Boston Globe will cease publishing its Sunday New Hampshire news section next month and close its Manchester bureau in a response to the sluggish economy and reduced advertising revenues . <p> The final issue of the New Hampshire Weekly Section will be published June 24 , the newspaper said May 10 . Beginning July 1 , the Globe will provide expanded versions of its North Weekly and NorthWest Weekly sections with at least a page devoted to New Hampshire news . <p> Publisher Richard H. Gilman said the Globe " remains committed to readers and advertisers in southern New Hampshire , and we feel we can still serve them well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Globe is owned by The New York Times Co. , which has announced several cost-cutting measures in recent months . The Globe has sent letters offering buyouts to 800 managers and eligible union employees . <p> &gt;+++++ Third daily makes first appearance in Denver <p> DENVER ( AP ) - A third daily newspaper began circulating in Denver , but its publisher says it is not trying to compete with The Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News . <p> The Denver Daily News , a free tabloid , circulated about 1,000 copies of an eight-page edition on May 10 in Denver 's Lower Downtown section . <p> " We are Colorado people who always wanted to start a free newspaper in Denver and now we 've done it , " said Mike Kirschbaum , publisher and editor . <p> The newspaper is published by investors led by Jim Pavelich of Vail and Dave Price formerly of Denver . They are co-publishers of the Palo Alto ( Calif . ) Daily News , a free newspaper that distributes about 30,000 copies in Silicon Valley . <p> The new Denver paper has three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is printed at a commercial plant in Golden . Kirschbaum said he soon would hire additional employees , including editors and reporters , and increase circulation . <p> Jim Nolan , spokesman for the Denver Newspaper Agency , which publishes the Post and the News , declined comment on the new newspaper . Both papers carried brief stories about the new daily on its first day . <p> The Post and the News formed a joint operating agency in January , merging all of their operations except their newsrooms . They began a new publishing schedule on April 7 : The News publishes alone on Saturdays and the Post publishes alone on Sundays . <p> The newspapers experienced significant circulation declines in the first quarter after they phased out subscription incentives , including penny-a-day rates . And some advertisers , led by furniture dealer Jake Jabs , complained the newspapers increased their rates exorbitantly after they merged . <p> Also , voters recently agreed to allow Denver government to suspend its rule that legal notices be published in one of the newspapers after an official complained the new advertising rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to take advantage of the new newspaper landscape . <p> " We have no intention of competing with those folks , " said Kirschbaum , who was general manager of three suburban Denver dailies . " We are trying to fill a need we see for a free newspaper and affordable advertising in a section of Denver that is often forgotten . " <p> &gt;+++++ Rival newspapers in Arizona unite to oppose news-rack plan <p> TEMPE , Ariz . ( AP ) - A city proposal to clean up littered street corners by replacing individual sidewalk newspaper racks with a single steel box to hold all the papers is drawing criticism from national and local publications . <p> Newspapers including USA Today and The Wall Street Journal are joining forces with Phoenix-area rivals the East Valley Tribune and The Arizona Republic to ask the Tempe City Council to kill the idea . <p> The Phoenix suburb proposed starting the six-month newspaper rack experiment in July . The five downtown test locations could be increased to 25 locations if the program is successful . <p> The modular news racks hold several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space available to the newspapers and often do n't work . <p> Rod Keeling , director of Downtown Tempe Community Inc. , said individual newspaper racks contribute to litter and have become an eyesore . <p> " It would n't be so bad if everybody policed themselves , but they do n't , " he said . " Newspapers are flying all over the place . " <p> The company that would bring in the steel boxes , City Solutions of Santa Barbara , Calif. , already maintains boxes in Indianapolis and will soon start a pilot program in Miami . <p> Neither Tempe nor newspapers would be charged for the racks . City Solutions makes money by selling advertising on the back of boxes facing the street , company partner Dave Hughes said . <p> Attorney David Bodney , who represents the Republic , said ads on the boxes would violate Tempe 's ban on billboards . <p> Several newspapers have offered to hire workers to keep existing news racks clean . <p> &gt;+++++ Record Stockman sold to Denver publisher <p> WHEAT RIDGE , Colo . ( AP ) - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , has been sold to a Denver publisher . <p> John Thomas , former publisher of several weeklies in Colorado and Idaho , has purchased the newspaper 's stock owned by Publisher Harry Green . <p> Green , 78 , who worked in livestock publishing for 63 years , will be publisher emeritus and a consultant . His son , Dan Green , is editor . <p> The sale took place May 2 and was announced May 9 . <p> Affiliates , stations oppose lifting TV cap <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - The nation 's broadcasting lobby and more than 600 network affiliate stations are asking a federal appeals court to keep in place restrictions on how big a TV company can grow . <p> Specifically , they want the court to retain a federal rule that prevents one entity from owning TV stations that reach more than 35 percent of U.S. households . <p> Major networks Fox , NBC and CBS have petitioned the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to throw out the cap . They believe it no longer has a place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets provide a diversity of viewpoints for consumers . The networks also have argued that the rule intrudes on their First Amendment rights , since it limits how many people one company can talk to . <p> But local stations say that relaxing the rule will give the networks too much control and an even stronger hand in negotiations with their affiliates . <p> With this bargaining power , networks can demand that all their national programming be carried through by local affiliates , the National Association of Broadcasters and the Network Affiliated Stations Alliance argued in a petition filed with the court May 8 . <p> In turn , stations will lose their ability to pre-empt national programming to air shows of interest to their local area , the groups said . <p> " This shift in the balance of power has already begun to impinge on the ability of consumers to view local programming that meets community needs , " the groups wrote . <p> The split between networks and local affiliates over the cap has become so tense that all the major networks except for ABC have dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents more than 600 TV stations , which are affiliates of NBC , ABC and CBS . <p> The court will hear arguments on the case this fall . Earlier this year , the court threw out similar restrictions on cable TV companies - a move many believe gives new vigor to the networks ' battle against the broadcast limit . <p> On another media regulation , the Federal Communications Commission indefinitely delayed its plan to propose changes to a rule that currently prohibits one company from owning a broadcast station and newspaper in the same market . <p> On the Net : <p> FCC : http : //www.fcc.gov <p> NAB : http : //www.nab.org <p> &gt;+++++ Lack named NBC president in corporate restructuring <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - NBC has restructured its top management , naming NBC News chief Andrew Lack network president and chief operating officer as 15-year leader Bob Wright devotes more time to parent company General Electric . <p> Lack will report to Wright , who moves from president to chairman of the network , and will oversee NBC 's news and entertainment divisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sales team . <p> Wright , who referred to Lack as his partner , retains authority over NBC Sports , its Olympic coverage , CNBC International and NBC 's staff operations . The management changes were announced May 8 . <p> It 's the second time in six months that a news executive has taken authority over NBC 's entertainment operations . Jeff Zucker , the former " Today " show executive producer , became NBC entertainment president in December . <p> NBC News has become the profitable leader of the industry since Lack took over in 1993 . The " Today " show and " NBC Nightly News " lead in the ratings and " Dateline NBC " is a mainstay in prime-time . <p> " It 's fair to say I could n't be more excited , " said Lack , 53 . " This is a great opportunity for me . " <p> " Dateline NBC " executive producer Neal Shapiro was appointed May 10 as Lack 's successor as NBC News president . <p> Shapiro , 43 , has been executive producer of " Dateline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hours of news each week on NBC 's prime-time schedule . Before that , he worked at ABC News for four years as a producer at " Primetime Live . " <p> Wright , 58 , has been NBC president and chief executive officer since 1986 . He 's also vice chairman and executive officer and GE , and said he expects to spend more time there with an upcoming transition in leadership . <p> While the news division is doing well , Lack faces more challenges in prime time . NBC is involved in a bitterly competitive race for dominance with CBS and ABC , has been slow to jump into reality TV and saw CBS mount a serious challenge to its Thursday night schedule this spring . <p> The profitable CNBC is the clear market leader in business news . MSNBC is third behind CNN and Fox News Channel , but it boasts a younger audience than its rivals . <p> NBC has recently had some business disappointments , shutting down its loss-ridden Internet subsidiary and seeing its partnership with the World Wrestling Federation in the XFL football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings disappointment . <p> Both Lack and Wright said NBC will be looking aggressively to grow , strongly discounting any thoughts that NBC will be a takeover target . Unlike rivals ABC and CBS , NBC is not affiliated with a large , diversified media and entertainment company . <p> " The challenge that I have in my GE and NBC roles is to find good , solid growth opportunities for NBC , " Wright said . " It is not to sell the company , it is not to merge the company , it is not to break it up . " <p> Asked whether Lack should be considered the heir apparent as overall NBC chief , Wright said he did n't want to use the term . <p> " The announcement speaks for itself , " he said . " Andy and I have to live by the sword in terms of our ability to accomplish things . Everyone will succeed based upon our ability to be successful .

Each rating point represents a little more than 1 million TV homes . <p> " Launching a new football league in such a short time period was a daunting and exciting challenge , but we gave it our best shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoped to provide his network with football after it lost its National Football League contract after the 1997 season . <p> NBC had planned to use the promotional skills of WWF Chairman Vince McMahon to draw the young male viewers that advertisers crave and air games on Saturdays , which generally have poor TV ratings . <p> But the " extreme " football league had trouble deciding whether it wanted to be about sport or spectacle . <p> Early games had lascivious cheerleader shots , sophomoric double entendres and screaming announcers - including Minnesota Gov . Jesse Ventura , a former WWF wrestler - who sounded more like shills than analysts . <p> The XFL even sped up games after a double-overtime contest in Week 2 delayed " Saturday Night Live . " Other rules changes came as late as the playoffs , and tinkering with the production side never ceased . <p> At stadiums , the eight-team league said it sold about 1 million tickets , but the championship game drew only 24,153 people to the 90,000-seat Los Angeles Coliseum . <p> Overall , the league sold only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable channel TNN . The rest was given to sponsors for free to make up for the low ratings . <p> NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league would have no comment - a position the NFL has maintained throughout the XFL 's existence . <p> &gt;+++++ CNBC responds to return of Lou Dobbs ' to CNN 's ' Moneyline ' <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - CNBC is responding to the return of Lou Dobbs to the set of CNN 's " Moneyline " by expanding its rival " Business Center " to two hours . <p> CNBC also is instituting format changes and scheduling an exclusive interview with one of the world 's richest men on May 14 , the day Dobbs starts . <p> The veteran anchor should take that as a compliment , and evidence of the outsized importance of these two nightly business wrap-up programs to their cable networks given their relatively small audiences . <p> Dobbs certainly was n't worrying about high expectations , fueled in part by some tongue-in-cheek promotions that aired incessantly on his network . <p> " I suppose I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I 've been brought back to do a job that I was very comfortable doing for 19 years . I 'm very comfortable with my audience and very comfortable with the material . " <p> Dobbs left the program nearly two years ago after feuding with since-departed management . He joined an Internet startup . His return was negotiated this spring by a struggling network anxious for some good news . <p> " Moneyline " lost roughly 25 percent of its audience since Dobbs left and lost its ratings lead to " Business Center , which averages 323,000 viewers a night to CNN 's 258,000 . <p> PBS ' " Nightly Business Report " has a bigger audience than both cable networks combined . But it has no commercials , and advertisers are eager to reach the affluent audiences of the cable business shows . At the time Dobbs left , " Moneyline " was CNN 's most profitable show and is still able to charge more for ads than " Business Center . " <p> Starting May 14 , " Business Center " will move its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 8 p.m . EDT on weeknights . " Moneyline " is on from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m . <p> " Business Center " plans , at 7:30 p.m. , to give a special " executive summary " of the day 's top business stories , designed for people who get home from work later than the show 's 6 p.m. start . That also gives " Moneyline " viewers the chance to switch over and see CNBC 's top stories . <p> For the May 14 program , CNBC is touting an exclusive interview with Prince Al-Waleed of the Saudi royal family , one of the world 's wealthiest men . <p> CNN plans some high-profile guests of its own the same day , including U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Prescott Bush Jr. , chairman of the United States of America-China Chamber of Commerce . <p> The May 14 program also will mark the first day of work for Tim O'Brien , formerly of ABC News , who will be a Washington-based " Moneyline " correspondent . Dobbs is planning other production and personnel changes and a viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I prefer a broader look at the world and frankly a deeper one than the tack taken recently , " Dobbs said . <p> He 's not expecting to overtake CNBC immediately but predicts it will happen . <p> " I do n't have any illusions about how difficult this task is , to restore the competitiveness of this broadcast , " he said . " My guess is it will take somewhere in the neighborhood of a year to be competitive . " <p> CNBC is confident it will keep its lead , saying Dobbs has to bring back virtually all the viewers the telecast has lost over the last two years to win . <p> &gt;+++++ Poor box office drags down News Corp . results <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . reported lower profits May 9 as a poor showing at the box office worsened the decline from a year ago , when results were lifted by a one-time gain . <p> News Corp . earned $ 111 million in the three months ending in March , well below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when the company had a $ 107 million gain from the sale of its stake in Zee TV , an Indian television business . <p> Without the effect of that sale and other one-time factors , earnings fell 34 percent to $ 127 million from $ 193 million a year ago . Per-share profits fell to 12 cents from 18 cents , beating the 9 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call . <p> Revenues rose 1 percent to $ 3.27 billion from $ 3.24 billion in the same period a year ago . <p> Earnings at News Corp . ' s Hollywood studio Twentieth Century Fox fell by more than half to $ 46 million compared with $ 95 million a year ago , a decline the company blamed on poor receipts from " Monkeybone " as well as higher marketing costs for new releases . <p> News Corp . president Peter Chernin , speaking to reporters in a conference call , declined to specify the amount of losses attributable to the box office flop . " It 's one of the vagaries of the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into problems sometimes . " <p> Chernin said he was " optimistic " that an end was near in the company 's negotiations with General Motors Corp . to acquire DirecTV , the leading satellite broadcaster in the United States . News Corp . has been trying to advance the talks for months , and Murdoch has expressed frustration at the delay . <p> Earnings from television edged up 1 percent to $ 96 million despite a 9 percent decline in earnings from Fox 's television stations due to the softer advertising market . The Fox network made up for the shortfall by cutting costs with cheaper programming . <p> Cable television earnings rose 26 percent on growth from FX and Fox News Channel , which had its second consecutive quarter of profitability . The gains came despite startup costs from News Corp .
