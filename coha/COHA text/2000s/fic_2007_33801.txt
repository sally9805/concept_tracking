The Man Who Knew Too Much-or , Possibly , Too Little The face of the woman behind the reception desk at FBI headquarters in downtown Cincinnati was oddly familiar and a bit unsettling . Something about her skin did n't look quite right . It looked like the skin of a dead person . It looked like you could peel her face right off her skull . " Yes , may I help you ? " asked the woman , but there was n't much help in the voice . " We 're Wally and Cheyenne Shluffmuffin , " said Wally . " We 're here to see Special Agent Cromwell . " " And you have an appointment ? " said the woman . " Well , no , but we 've been here before , " said Wally . The Shluffmuffin twins were ten years old , had red hair and freckles and a tendency to attract creatures with sinister intentions , most of whom were not even human . " And what was this in reference to ? " said thewoman . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pictures . . . ? " " Of the six buses that disappeared in downtown Cincinnati , " said Cheyenne . " And pictures of the people who were on the buses when they disappeared . Agent Cromwell said he was going to show them to people in his department and then get back to us , but we have n't heard from him in over two weeks . " " And these pictures were taken where ? " said the woman . " It does n't matter , " said Wally , deciding against saying they were taken in the cave of the Ont Queen , ruler of all giant ants in the state of Ohio . " Can we just please see Agent Cromwell ? " " No . " " Excuse me ? " said Wally . " Special Agent Cromwell no longer works here , " said the woman . " No ? What happened to him ? " said Cheyenne . " He 's dead . " " Dead ? " said Cheyenne . " But we just saw him two weeks ago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was fine , " said the woman . " But now he 's dead . It was very sudden . Sudden and tragic . We were all quite stunned . " " What did he die of ? " Wally asked . " Heart attack , " said the woman , suddenly losing interest in the discussion and turning back to papers on her desk . " Is there anything else ? I 'm afraid we 're quite busy here today . " " Who 's taking over for Agent Cromwell ? " Cheyenne asked . " Nobody . " " Well then , can we at least get our pictures back ? " Cheyenne asked . " And what pictures would those be ? " said the woman , studying her papers . " We just told you , " said Wally . " Pictures of the six buses that disappeared downtown ? " The woman reached into a drawer , pulled out some printed forms , and held them out to the twins without looking up . " Fill these forms out in triplicate , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances under which you are claiming it , attaching a notarized statement of value and a proof of loss form , and then we will process your claim . When the process is complete , somebody will be in touch with you . " " And when do you think that might happen ? " asked Cheyenne , taking the forms . " Twelve to fourteen weeks , " said the woman . " This is our busy season . " " Never mind , " said Cheyenne . She gave back the forms . As soon as they got into the elevator and pushed the down button and the doors slid closed , Wally announced : " Cromwell was murdered . " " Are you sure ? " Cheyenne asked . " I 'm positive . " " But why ? " Cheyenne asked . " He knew too much . " " How do you know that ? " Cheyenne asked . " I just know , " said Wally . " He either knew too much or he knew too little . He did n't know just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alive today . " " How much is just enough ? " said Cheyenne . " That is something we will never know , " said Wally . " You think it was because of the pictures ? " said Cheyenne . She sneezed and blew her nose into a tissue . Cheyenne was allergic to absolutely everything . " Oh god , Wally , I 'd hate to think it was because we gave him those pictures . I 'd hate to think we caused his death . Do you think we caused his death ? " Wally nodded . " I 'm sure of it , " he said . " But then what happened to our pictures ? The whole thing sounds so bogus to me . A sudden heart attack , right ? The onts must have a mole in the Cincinnati office who killed him . It might even have been that stupid receptionist we just talked to . " " Why do you say that ? " Cheyenne asked . " Did you get a good look at her face ? " said Wally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those rubber masks that Dagmar and Hedy used to wear . " Cheyenne shuddered . Dagmar and Hedy Mandible were the two mysterious ladies who 'd taken them out of the Jolly Days Orphanage to their home in spooky Dripping Fang Forest for a trial adoption . After discovering the Mandible sisters were n't ladies but giant ants breeding a race of super-ants to enslave humans and end life on Earth as we know it , the twins managed to escape . " I hate to say it , but I think you 're right , " Cheyenne murmured . " I sure hope she does n't think we suspect her . " " We did n't do anything to make her think we suspect her , " said Wally . " Lucky I still have the negatives , " said Cheyenne . " I 'll get some more prints made . Who can we take them to , though ? " " Well , we sure ca n't trust anyone in the Cincinnati office , " said Wally . " Let 's go to that FBI place in Quantico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the guys who profile serial killers and stuff . I doubt the onts have planted anybody in Quantico yet . " " How will we get there ? " Cheyenne asked . " We do n't have money for planes . " " We 'll take the train , " said Wally . " It 's cheaper than flying and a whole lot safer . " The elevator arrived at the main floor . The doors slid open and the twins stopped talking , fearing they might be overheard . The receptionist switched off the small silver tape recorder on her desk . She hit rewind and then play . The voices from the elevator were thin and tinny but very clear : " . . . to that FBI place in Quantico , Virginia , where they train their agents . Where they have the guys who profile serial killers and stuff . I doubt the onts have planted anybody in Quantico yet . " e : 10.0pt ; mso-bidi-font-family : ' Times New Roman ' " " How will we get there ? We do n't have money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's cheaper than flying and a whole lot safer . " The receptionist hit stop and slipped the small silver tape recorder into her handbag . Text copyright c 2007 by Dan Greenburg Illustrations copyright c 2007 by Scott M.
