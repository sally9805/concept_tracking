<p> CLEVELAND  --  When outfielder Kenny Lofton left the Cleveland Indians after 2001 , he felt empty and incomplete without a championship . Now , at 40 , he ca n't think of a better city for which to win his first World Series ring . <p> " It was hard to leave when I know we should have won , " he says . " Cleveland is a special place . We had a lot of good teams , and we did n't win . That 's a little depressing , and I can understand how the fans in Cleveland feel . I 've been there with them . I have felt their pain , lived their heartache . I feel for them . " <p> The Indians have n't won the World Series since beating the Boston Braves in 1948 , a little-known fact outside the city and northeast Ohio . Cleveland 's misery does n't get the attention of the Chicago Cubs , the lovable losers who have n't won a Series since 1908 . <p> But at a time when droughts are ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston Red Sox for baseball 's best record , they open tonight at home against the New York Yankees in a best-of-five American League Division Series . <p> In 2004 , the Red Sox ended their " Curse of the Bambino " by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals to win their first title since 1918 . A year later , the Chicago White Sox swept the Houston Astros to end a drought that started in 1917 . <p> " The fans in this city are ready and eager for a championship , " says Hall of Famer Bob Feller , who pitched on the 1948 team . " I like this team 's chances to win . It 'd be wonderful for the city of Cleveland . " <p> Cleveland 's championship drought goes beyond the Indians ' powerhouse teams of the 1990s . The Cavaliers have never won an NBA title . The football Browns ' last championship was in 1964 , two seasons before the first Super Bowl . <p> The Indians won what was arguably baseball 's best division , the AL Central , and pounded division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champ Minnesota Twins , including 5-0 against Johan Santana , the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner . <p> A World Series title would end what Terry Pluto , an author and columnist for The ( Cleveland ) Plain Dealer , says is the worst suffering of all baseball fans . Cubs , Schmubs . <p> " As for the misery index , we do n't want to hear their problems , " says Pluto , a life-long Indians fan . " We know we 've had it worse . The media just like them better . " <p> Long frustration <p> The Indians ' losing does n't take long to describe . Cleveland won 111 games in 1954 , then got swept by the New York Giants in the World Series . From 1960 through 1993 , the Indians did n't play a September game with pennant hopes . In 1994 , they were one game out in the division when the labor dispute led to the cancellation of the season in August . <p> Cleveland won six of seven AL Central titles from 1995 through 2001 , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six games in the ' 95 World Series . Two years later the Florida Marlins beat them in Game 7 of the World Series on Edgar Renteria 's RBI single in the last of the 11th inning . <p> In 2005 the Indians lost six of the last seven games to be eliminated from playoff contention . " We learned a lot from that season , " ace left-hander C.C. Sabathia says . <p> Pluto says the ultimate insult was the ' 97 World Series loss to Florida , an expansion team in its fifth season : " Two generations of baseball fans have passed since 1948 . That 's why 1997 hurts so much . Losing in Game 7 to the Florida Marlins , a team that has been around for five minutes ? In 1995 , fans were just happy to be in the World Series for the first time in 41 years . In 1997 , that was their chance . " <p> Suffer in silence <p> So why is n't the Indians ' misery more publicized ? " The Red Sox have a bunch of celebrity mourners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Red Sox fan , " Pluto says . " It takes guts to follow the Tribe . The fans suffer , but no one outside of northeast Ohio or the transplanted Clevelanders listens or cares . " <p> Maybe , but walk the spacious corridors of Jacobs Field , which opened in 1994 , and Indians fans , dressed in bright red T-shirts , say the losing hurts . They only talk about it in matter-of-fact tones . They do n't create their identity with never-ending losing from the past . They talk about their frustration but quickly direct the conversation to the present . <p> They like that the organization develops players with a blue-collar approach and does n't depend on big-money free agents for stability . They loved that the team 's management did n't panic when the Indians finished 78-84 in 2006 , a year after they built incredible expectations by going 93-69 . <p> Life-long Indians fan Fred Klohs , 68 , a retired bakery salesman from the Cleveland suburb of Brook Park , recalls attending the 1948 World Series parade , the Giants ' sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to teach his grandchildren about loyalty . <p> " I 've sat through 100-loss seasons , and that 's what a true baseball fan does , " Klohs says . " You take it to heart , but you support the team . It hurt to lose to the Marlins in ' 97 , but ( Florida ) sold off the whole team the next season ( and lost 108 games ) . We do n't blow our team up like that . " <p> Shirley Roberts , a truck driver from Salineville , Ohio , about 100 miles southeast of Cleveland , says she will never stop cheering for the Tribe , although " you are always saying , ' Wait till next year , wait till next year , wait till next year . ' It 's time to win . " <p> Timothy Shaw , a taxicab driver who has spent his entire life following the Indians , says the city " would go insane " with a World Series title . <p> " It would be especially nice for the old-time fans who sit and listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " And I think the Indians have a chance to win . Pitching wins in October , and the Indians have a lot of pitching . " <p> Stronger arms <p> That much is true . <p> The Indians of the 1990s were defined by the bruising lineups of Albert Belle , Jim Thome , Manny Ramirez and David Justice . In ' 97 , eight players reached double figures in home runs , including three with 100-plus RBI . The pitching was average , with 15-game winner Charles Nagy , Orel Hershiser ( 14-6 ) , who was 38 , and three other starters ( Chad Ogea , Bartolo Colon and Jaret Wright ) who combined to go 20-19 . <p> This season , the Indians rotation is led by Sabathia ( 19-7 , 3.21 ERA ) and Fausto Carmona ( 19-8 , 3.06 ) , strong hopefuls to win the AL Cy Young Award . <p> Sabathia is a homegrown pitcher who is 100-63 over his seven seasons . Carmona signed as a non-drafted free agent in December 2000 and went 1-10 as a rookie last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Injuries to Jake Westbook and Cliff Lee were the only reason Carmona got a chance in the rotation this season . <p> Cleveland also has Paul Byrd , 36 , whose old-fashioned windup makes him a modern-day right-handed version of Warren Spahn . Byrd went 15-8 this season , his most victories since 2002 . <p> The no-name bullpen , a nightmare in past seasons for the team , matches the city 's blue-collar psyche . The Rafaels  --  Betancourt and Perez  --  each has an ERA lower than 1.80 , setting up closer Joe Borowski , who has 45 saves . The bullpen ranks fifth in the AL in ERA . <p> The pitching makes up for the typical Cleveland outcome of nothing going as planned : <p> *The intended closer , Keith Foulke , retired in spring training . <p> *The first homestand was postponed by snow . <p> *Designated hitter Travis Hafner , a career .297 batter before this season , ended at .266 . <p> *Lee , an 18-game winner two years ago , and Jeremy Sowers , 7-4 as a rookie in 2006 , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't play well and David Dellucci was hurt . <p> *Casey Blake was supposed to play right and first but wound up at third base . Ryan Garko was a converted catcher playing first base . <p> *Perez and outfielder Franklin Gutierrez made unexpected contributions . <p> *Switch-hitting rookie shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera , who began at Class AA Akron ( Ohio ) , came up Aug. 7 and has hit in the No. 2 slot while playing second base  --  even though he had never played that position in the minors . <p> " Somewhere among the snow , craziness and injuries this team has become family , " Byrd says . " I 've never seen anything like this in my career . It seems like every time we needed a lift , a pickup , somebody came through . It 's been a lot of unsung heroes that have really made this team what it is . " <p> ' 48 flashback ? <p> The Indians took over first for good in the AL Central in mid-August . They took control by sweeping the AL champion Detroit Tigers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-2 win against the Oakland Athletics on the second-to-last weekend of the season . Betancourt struck out Mark Ellis to end the game . <p> " It 's been a special season the way we 've won , " Blake says . " We have a good feeling every time we take the field . We think this is going to be our year . " <p> In a sense , the Indians have turned back the calendar to the ' 90s , especially with the return of Lofton , playing in his 11th postseason . A decade ago he was the team 's speedy center fielder who hit leadoff . Now he plays left and hits toward the end of the lineup . <p> In the last week , memories of the 1990s have come flooding back to Lofton . He started this season with the Texas Rangers and returned to Cleveland in a July27 trade . In his first at-bat , the fans at Jacobs Field gave him a standing ovation . <p> It was an emotional moment . <p> " It was nice , " Lofton says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special time for me . I knew this team had a chance , but I want this team to know how good it is . I want to be part of the puzzle and win in Cleveland . " <p> And turn back the calendar to 1948 . <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
