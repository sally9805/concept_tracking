Chapter One Early September 1901 The same . Everything was always the same . Sophie Knutson glared at the face in the mirror . Her face , her hair , her home , Blessing , and now that school had started , it was one more same old thing . The final same old ? She 'd not heard from Hamre in over a month . Not that it mattered , of course . She pinned her hair in a swirl on top of her head , but when she moved , it slipped and fell about her shoulders . Slamming her comb down on the dressing table , she leaped up and returned to her pacing . " I hate school ! " Grace looked up at her sister stomping from one side to the other of the bedroom they 'd shared all their lives , just as they 'd shared their mother 's womb seventeen years ago . Grace spoke slowly , as if choosing her thoughts with great care . She kept her fingers in her lap , fingers that spoke far more swiftly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words she could not hear . " Sophie , look at me . What did you say ? " " I said I hate school . " " I know . But this will be our last year , and you promised to finish . " Grace picked up the hairbrush lying in her lap . Sophie clamped her fists on hips clothed by a white lawn chemise , trimmed in lace , all sewn with love by Grace , who was now sitting cross-legged on the bed . As usual , Sophie had started something and never gotten around to finishing it . Months ago she 'd cut out the lawn pieces , and when Grace tired of looking at them , she finished the garment for her sister . " I wish ... I wish I ... " Sophie 's eyes grew dreamy , looking into some faraway place . " School is so boring . " She plopped down on the bed , facing Grace so they would n't have to sign . Grace had been born deaf but was liberated from her silent world when Kaaren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill to all of them , which led to starting the school she now ran for the training of deaf people . " What do you wish ? " Grace asked . Sophie knew her sister already knew the answer , since it had been the same since their childhood . Nevertheless , Grace indulged her . " I want to go places , see new things , meet new people . " Sophie flung her arms dramatically wide . " There 's a whole world out there , and we are stuck here in Blessing . " " Not forever . " " I know , but the ever seems so far away ! " She flopped back on the pillows . I do n't want to go to school . That 's all there is to it . " What would you do if you did n't go to school ? " Ever practical , Grace unplaited her daytime braids with graceful fingers . " I could help Bestemor at the boardinghouse or work for Penny in the store , since Rebecca will be back in school . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I could find work in Grand Forks or Grafton . Grafton-Ellie 's family lives there . Surely Goodie could find me something to do . " But you do n't like blood . " " Better than school . " Sophie ran her fingers into her dark hair and pulled it straight up . " Maybe I should cut my hair into a fringe . " " Now that would be an adventure . " " I saw it in a magazine . It 's the latest rage . If I get the scissors , will you help me ? " " But your hair waves back so beautifully . Not like mine . " Grace pulled a hank of what she called mouse brown hair over her shoulder and waved it at her sister . She 'd gone back to braiding it to keep it out of her way . " Be right back . " Sophie signed with flying fingers as she leaped off the bed . Racing down the stairs , she snatched the scissors out of the sewing room and raced back up . Sophie never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway . Grace lived up to her name . Right now she sat on the bed with her arms raised , braiding her thick hair for the night . The light from the kerosene lamp outlined her in gilt . If I leave , or rather , when I leave , what about Grace ? How will I live without her ? Yet I know she wo n't want to go along . Grace loved school , loved being at home , loved helping their mother with the deaf school . Her patience with the new students was never ending , forming their fingers into the signs that would free them from their silent prison . After all , she had once been where they were . She understood . Sophie crossed to stand in front of the mirror . Did she dare cut her hair ? Just a few strands right in front . She tried folding her hair to hang short in front on her forehead to give her an idea what it would look like . She turned without thinking so that Grace could read her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had n't you better think on it more ? " " No . At least I will look a little different . Hold the hair in back so I can drop just the ends over my forehead . " Grace did as she asked and looked over her sister 's shoulder to stare into the mirror . Their eyes met , Sophie 's dancing with the thought of such daring , Grace 's caught in a question mark . " I 'm going to do it . " Sophie handed Grace the scissors . " I 'll hold the comb ; you cut . " " No . If you want them short , you cut . " " I know . You cut mine , and I 'll cut yours . " Sophie whirled and , with the comb , tugged a few strands of Grace 's hair loose from the night braid . While the two girls looked much alike in stature , Sophie had a wider forehead , an upturned nose , and darker eyes to match her hair . Grace 's face was more oval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashes . While Grace called her hair mousy , Sophie referred to it as tawny , shot with gold . Together they decided to call Sophie 's hair nutmeg with cinnamon trails . They 'd been on a spice-searching mission that day , with Sophie dreaming of the lands that grew the spices they used to flavor food . Pepper had been too dark , cinnamon too red , allspice too strong , and nutmeg just right . Grace hefted the scissors , opened the blades wide , slid one edge along her sister 's forehead , and pulled away . " I ca n't do this . " " Of course you can . Just cut right above my eyebrows . I read that was best . " " But what if I slip and cut you ? " " You wo n't . " Sophie combed the long strands all the way out and started again at her scalp , stopping at eye level . " There , now cut . " She adopted a frown of command on her face , knowing her sister well enough to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm stand . " Sophie Knutson , if Mor scolds you , do n't you dare blame me . " Grace slid the scissors back in place and snipped . The newly released long tresses slid through the comb and drifted to the floor . Both girls studied the results in the mirror , mouths matching in perfect Os . " Do you like it ? " Sophie asked , breaking the silence . " Not much . Do you ? " " I think it will take some getting used to . " " What will Mor say ? " " What will Mor say to what ? " The voice from the doorway spun Sophie around with a shriek . " Ah , I ... ah ... " Grace followed , her eyes as round as her sister 's . " Sophie , what did you do ? " Kaaren stood stock-still . " Ah , Grace ... " Grace gave her a shove and stepped backward , her fingers flying so fast even Kaaren could n't keep track . " Sophie made you ? " Grace nodded vigorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught with her finger in the cookie dough . She straightened her shoulders and huffed , " I 've wanted a fringe for a long time . " " I see . " Kaaren crossed the room to peer more closely at the damage . " Is it supposed to look ragged like this ? " " No-o . " Sophie turned and stared in the mirror again . " The pictures in the magazine showed them even and puffy . Maybe we should cut it all off , right at the roots . " Kaaren shook her head , the lamplight catching highlights in her golden coronet that had always reminded the girls of either crowns or halos , depending on what they were reading at the time . " Mother , do n't laugh , " Sophie wailed . " I 'm trying not to . " Kaaren took the scissors in one hand and the comb in the other . Sophie backed away , her hands splayed in defense in front of her . " What are you going to do ? " " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless you 'd rather leave it the way it is . " She turned to hand the scissors to Grace , who backed away , her hands locked behind her back . When she offered the tools to Sophie , she got the same reaction . " All right , then , go the way you are or let me fix it . " Sophie gulped and nodded . Surely her mother could redeem the efforts . She 'd always been able to do so with everything else . She scrunched her eyes closed and offered her face as if going to the guillotine . " Just look at me like you usually would , or I will not be responsible for the way it looks . " Sophie opened her eyes wide , then blinked and focused on her mother , her shoulders tense , arms rigid at her sides . Kaaren snipped a bit here and trimmed a bit there . The hair fell , and Sophie sneezed . " Sorry . " " Good thing I was n't cutting right then . " Kaaren trimmed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and combed the hair up and over her finger . " There , I think that will do . " She stepped back . " Not bad if I do say so myself . " She turned to Grace . " What do you think ? " " Better , much better , but I 'm still not sure I like it . " " I 'm afraid it will take some getting used to . " Kaaren studied her daughter . " But I think it looks good on you . " " Now it 's Grace 's turn . " Sophie gave herself a doubtful look in the mirror one more time . Grace shook her head . " I am not cutting my hair into a fringe . " She signed at the same time , her fingers slashing the air . " But you said ... " " No . You said I would . " Grace knelt down and swept the fallen hair into one hand with the other . " I 'll bet you a penny that the other girls will have theirs cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no betting in this house . " Kaaren brushed short bits of dark hair off her daughter 's chemise . " Now , it is bedtime , and you should be grateful your pa is off with the threshing crew . The shock of this might be too much for him . " " Ma , you really- " Sophie caught the glint of teasing in her mother 's eyes and tone . She shook her head and turned back to the mirror . " I think it does indeed grow on one . " She fluffed the fringe with her fingers . Kaaren kissed each of her daughters good-night . " You get to sleep now . Morning will come far too soon , and the cows need to be milked before you leave for school . " " I know . " Sophie left off studying her new hairstyle and pulled her cambric nightdress over her head , then shimmied out of her chemise and camisole underneath it . She tied the blue ribbon at the neckline and folded back the blue-and-white nine-patch quilt they 'd helped their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Night , Mor . " She slid under the sheet and puffed her pillow behind her . After Kaaren left the room , Sophie turned on her side to watch her twin finish getting ready for bed and waved to catch Grace 's attention . " I have n't heard from Hamre for more than a month now . " " I know . " Grace tied her pink neck bow . Their light nightdresses matched , including the deep ruffle edged with lace at the bottom and the bodice trimmed with a dainty row of tatting , but for the colored ribbons . " He is either fishing or forgetting . " " Hmm . " Sophie pursed her lips and slitted her eyes . " We 've been corresponding regularly . Why would he forget ? " " Maybe he found a girlfriend . Can I blow out the lamp now ? " Sophie nodded and sighed . " I guess . " She stared at the ceiling in the darkness . Hamre would n't forget her , would he ? Unless he had indeed met someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side and clutch her pillow . Seattle was so far away . He 'd said there were lots of Norwegians there ; there must be plenty of attractive Norwegian girls . And he always signed his letters , " Your friend . " Did he care for her or not ? She tossed to the other side , and Grace reached over to pat her shoulder . Sophie rolled on her back and held her sister 's hand until they both fell asleep . (
