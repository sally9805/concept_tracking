Two years ago , I received five new organs in a rare transplant operation . The doctors did n't expect me to make it ... but my mom never let me stop fighting . // Unable to move my arms and legs , and silenced by the breathing tube inserted in my trachea , I looked at my mother . Painfully , I mouthed the words : " I want to die . " " No , Kathryn , you ca n't give up , " Mom said , reading my lips . She leaned in so close I could feel her breath merge with mine . Caressing my cheek , she said , " You do n't want to die . You 're going to live . " In 1996 , in a single day , our lives went from normal to nightmare . At first , I thought I just had a bad case of indigestion from eating too much Mexican food the night before . I was a junior in high school at the time and rarely ill . After my younger brother , Cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my parents went to work , and I fell back asleep . I woke up feeling nauseous . Throwing up was a relief , but then I saw the bathroom floor was covered with blood . Terrified and feeling faint , I staggered to the phone and called my mom , who raced home just in time to watch me get sick again . It took both my parents to get me to our family doctor . How ridiculous , I remember thinking as they carried me down the stairs . I 've been taking ballet for eleven years . How can my legs not work ? By afternoon , I was in the hospital near my home in Evans , Georgia , listening to doctors tell me that autoimmune hepatitis-probably the result of an undetected early-childhood virus-had silently destroyed my liver . Blood , unable to get through the hardened organ , was backing up , causing hemorrhaging throughout my body . I needed a transplant . At Emory University Hospital , in Atlanta , a shunt ( or bypass tube ) was put into my liver as a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hemorrhaging stopped . Doctors said I might not need a transplant after all . With my liver functioning at 50 percent capacity , I could live comfortably , and I soon resumed my full schedule , which included debate team and playing violin with the Georgia Honors Orchestra . I refused to brood ; I was too busy . By senior year , I was a National Merit Finalist and a Georgia Scholar . In the fall of 1997 , I headed for Atlanta as a premed student on scholarship at Georgia Tech . I immediately felt right at home . But the day after I got my bid from a sorority , I started feeling nauseous while buying books in the student center . Rushing to the bathroom , I threw up . Thank God , this time I knew what was happening and could get outside before I fainted . I sank to my knees in the hall and shouted , " Please help me ! " Then I passed out , fell on my face , and broke my nose . I woke up surrounded by paramedics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , I was bleeding internally . They reopened it , but I continued to hemorrhage and spent two weeks in the ICU , where my mom said I was completely out of it . Finally things stabilized , but doctors realized that the shunt was no longer a reliable option . They put me on the transplant list . Photograph Photograph Kathryn Smith in her dorm room at Georgia Tech , and , opposite , with her mother , Charlotte // Fourteen days later , I returned to school with an IV pole , bottles of medications , and a beeper that would alert me when an organ had been found for me . Until it went off , I intended to have a great time . Sometimes at parties , I had to explain why I did n't drink , and when I saw how shocked people were , it would hit me : " Whoa ! I 'm going to have a liver transplant ! " Mostly , though , I did n't dwell on it . I went out with friends a lot but also studied hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt tired the following summer , but not unwell , and I was able to return to Georgia Tech in the fall . Then , in the middle of my sorority semiformal , on November 8 , 1998 , the beeper went off . I arrived at the hospital with an entourage , everyone but me still in long dresses and tuxedos . Looking at photos taken that night , I 'm still struck by how radiantly healthy I looked . The surgery , I 'm told , went smoothly . My body did n't reject the liver , but it failed within a week anyway , when an artery became blocked . When the doctors explained that I would need a second liver transplant , I began to cry . Then I saw that my mom was crying too . " Mama , " I said , as we held each other . Suddenly I felt more calm . " Mama , " I told her , " I can do it . " The second operation , which , like the first , took place at Emory , lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it became clear that the new liver had been damaged when blood dots developed in vessels connected to the bowels . My intestines began to shut down , and doctors told my parents that I had 24 hours to live . Later , my mom told me that this had been the worst day of all . When she and my dad heard the news , they ran out of the hospital right onto Emory 's campus . " All around there were college students , young people who were ( continued from page 119 ) carefree and healthy , " Mom explained . " I kept thinking , This is a bad dream . Why ca n't I wake up ? Why is this happening to my child ? " ' When family and friends found out what was going on , they arrived at the hospital en masse and began a prayer vigil . God must have been listening , because somehow I beat the odds and lived . My doctors began to consider transplanting both a new liver and new intestines . I was transferred to Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical centers in the United States that do this type of multiple-organ transplant . The organs all come from the same donor and are transplanted as " clusters . " I would have been terrified if I 'd been conscious . As it happened , I had been out cold since the second transplant and stayed that way for the entire winter . In spring and early summer , I battled life-threatening infections that made the surgery impossible . At one point , doctors told my parents I had perhaps three hours to live . Nobody really knew what kept me going . But I imagine my mom had something to do with it . Having given up her job teaching high-school biology and left my dad , sister , and brother at home , she was by my side every day , arriving early and leaving late , nursing me , waiting . In August , the infections cleared just enough to allow surgery . Miraculously , donor organs became available , and the transplant doctors flew to Mississippi to harvest them . By this point , the doctors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also a new kidney , pancreas , small intestine , and stomach . My mom said it was the most difficult thing in the world for her to have to tell me that not only would I have to go through it all again , but that now I faced an even more monumental surgery . Because I was so weak , my chances of survival were only about 50 percent . The organs were declared a match at 3:00 A.M. on August 25 , 1999 ; transplant surgery began at 5:30 A.M. Twenty-one hours and 100 units of blood later , I awoke in the ICU , hooked up to a maze of wires and tubes , unable to move . I felt like I 'd been abducted by aliens . I was blind without my glasses , could n't talk because of the tracheotomy , and was freezing cold . Somehow I knew when my parents came in . Sensing them there was such a comfort ; it made me feel human again . Then my mom , who 's able to anticipate my every need , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got worse before they got better . First , a bowel leak triggered severe infections , which required massive doses of antibiotics . Those medications , in such a large quantity , cost me all of the hearing in one ear and half in the other . And then I battled drug-induced hallucinations , exhaustion , and depression . At first , I was too sick to think about what my body looked like . But one day I asked to see the scar . I will never forget the look on my mom 's face as she handed me a mirror . I know we were both praying that God would give me the strength to handle this devastating new reality . Covered only by thin nylon mesh , what once was my torso was now , from diaphragm to pelvis , an open wound . After nine tortuous months in the hospital relearning how to hold my head up , sit , stand , and walk , I moved into the apartment my mother had rented nearby . My body was terribly swollen , my hair was falling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a colostomy bag . But the ordeal was made more bearable by my family . My dad and my siblings-Cliff , Jay , and Dottie-were my cheering squad , always showing up just when I needed them most . Cliff once dressed up in a gown and mask to " assist " the doctor who was changing my dressing . I think I have every item ever made with the Harvard logo , sent by Jay , who was at law school there . Dottie spent two months with me in Miami . She 'd buy silly presents and paint my toenails with sparkly nail polish . I returned home to Evans in August 2000 , and it took the better part of a year for me to feel like myself again . I got rid of the tubes and colostomy bag , and physical therapy has helped me improve my posture , which had suffered from my spending so much time in bed . I 'm still determined to stand tall again , like the ballet dancer once was . My doctor says my prognosis is very good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . Of course , there are also risks , but I try not to think about them . This fall , I was thrilled to finally return to Georgia Tech , where I am studying hard , intent on becoming a doctor . Dottie is now in college , too-a junior at the University of Georgia , in Athens . My mother said it was " craziness " getting two girls ready for school , but , of course , she loved it . And I think she might be secretly happy to be rid of me for a while : Things are so normal again that my mom and I definitely can get on each other 's nerves ! I joke , but the truth is I will never take her for granted . I think of her sitting by my bed as I lay unconscious in the ICU ... hour after hour , day after day , month after endless month .
