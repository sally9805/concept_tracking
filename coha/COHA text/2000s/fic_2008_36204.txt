Judith McMonigle Flynn stood on the front porch of Hillside Manor , took a deep breath of fresh summer air , and gazed around the cozy cul-de-sac on the south slope of Heraldsgate Hill . It was a perfect June morning with pink and white dogwood trees in full bloom , maple trees swaying in the soft wind , and rosebushes bursting with new buds . <p> " Nice , " she said out loud . Not too warm , she thought , and so peaceful . The only sound was the chirping of baby birds in a nest that Mama and Papa Robin had built in the branches of a cotoneaster bush by the east side of the house . All the weekend B&amp;B guests had left by eleven o'clock on this last Monday of the month . <p> Judith was about to go back inside when she heard a rumbling noise . A plane overhead ? A helicopter ? A herd of stampeding buffalo ? The sound grew closer . She leaned on the porch railing and saw a huge truck pulling into the cul-de-sac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . Judith went down the front steps to see the big black and red letters on the truck 's side : grooving moving , inc . <p> " What 's going on ? " a voice nearby called out . <p> Judith turned to see Arlene Rankers coming out of her house on the other side of the laurel hedge . " I do n't know , " Judith replied . " Are Rudi and his girlfriend moving out ? " <p> Arlene 's pretty face puckered into a scowl . " If they are , I should 've known about it . Cathy keeps her ear to the ground when it comes to the real estate business . Surely my own daughter would 've told me . " <p> Judith gestured at the two burly young men who had gotten out of the truck . " They 're going to Rudi 's rental . I think their lease is up about this time of year . " <p> " That 's right . " Arlene started across the pavement that curved in front of the Rankerses ' house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Judith hesitated . She was as curious as Arlene , but lacked her neighbor 's brashness in posing awkward questions . Then again , there were times when Judith did n't want to know the truth . The moving van 's arrival was one of them . " Arlene ! " called a voice from farther down the cul-de-sac . " Wait ! " Rochelle Porter , who lived on the other side of the Rankers , hurried to the middle of the street where Arlene stood with her head cocked to one side like a curious bird . " What is it , Rochelle ? " she asked . <p> Rochelle motioned for Judith to join them . " Last night I could n't sleep , " Rochelle said , lowering her voice . " Gabe got a crazy notion that he wanted some real soul food . He made chitlins with vinegar and some kind of hot sauce that practically set my mouth on fire . For a black man who was raised right here in this city and has n't been farther south than Disneyland , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with these peculiar cravings . " She shook her head . " I was up half the night with heartburn . About three in the morning I saw lights over in Rudi Wittener 's house and a big U-Haul . Rudi 's girlfriend , Taryn , came outside , and the movers started hauling furniture from the house to the truck . " Rochelle gazed at the newly arrived moving van . " Look , they 're unloading the truck . Somebody else must be moving in . " <p> Arlene stamped her foot . " I 'm going to strangle Cathy ! She should have told me ! I 'm never the last to know ! " <p> Judith suppressed a smile . Arlene was right : she was indeed the font of all knowledge , rumor , and gossip on Heraldsgate Hill . Long ago , Judith had dubbed her neighbor 's store of information as Arlene 's Broadcasting System , or more briefly , ABS . <p> " Maybe , " Judith said soothingly , " Cathy does n't know . It 's odd to move out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ? " <p> Arlene glared at Judith . " You wonder ? Not as much as I do ! And , " she added , marching off toward the van , " I intend to find out ! " <p> Rochelle laughed and shook her head . " Arlene 's got more nerve than a peanut merchant . I admire her gumption . " <p> Judith nodded . " Me , too . She 's a terrific neighbor . " <p> Both women stopped talking as they watched Arlene 's animated conversation with the brawny movers . <p> " Bus ? " Arlene shouted . " What bus ? The nearest stop is a block and a half over on Heraldsgate Avenue . " <p> One of the men threw his hands in the air ; the other stomped off toward the ramp that had been propped up behind the van . <p> " Oh , for heaven 's sake ! " Arlene exclaimed . " If you people ca n't speak English , at least show me your work order ! My husband 's the block watch chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a heavy sigh and sagging of broad shoulders , the mover who 'd remained by the curb came around to the driver 's side of the van and opened the door . He returned with a clipboard and shoved it at Arlene . <p> " ' Buss ' ? " Arlene snapped , looking up from what Judith presumed was the work order . " You do n't spell ' bus ' with two esses . " <p> The man tapped his finger several times on the sheet of paper . <p> " Oh , " Arlene said , more quietly . " That 's the person 's name . Carry on . Or lift on . Or ... whatever you people do . " She headed back to Judith and Rochelle . " Someone named Billy Buss is moving in , " Arlene announced . " He 's from Oklahoma . There was a handwritten note attached to the work order . I think I got the gist of it . It indicated that Mr. Buss was anxious to be in the house by today , which , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such short notice . I hope they got a break on their rent . I was never fond of them , but fair is fair , after all . This Buss person sounds very demanding . I hope he 's not a musician . " <p> " Amen , " Rochelle said with fervor . " Rudi and his violin just about drove Gabe and me crazy as a pair of three-legged chickens . " <p> Judith agreed wholeheartedly . " His outdoor practice sessions , especially when he did them in the nude during the hot weather , upset all of us , including my B&amp;B guests . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
