" I was young and foolish then ; now I am old and foolisher. " * * * On October 15 , 1900 , in the twilit moments of the shifting century he had dissected in his books and embodied in his life , Mark Twain reemerged as from a long , dark dream into the welcoming uproar of his native America . He had been abroad in auto-exile , save for brief visits , for nearly ten years . It had been the most public of privations , this self-inflicted banishment of his . The newspapers had chronicled his plunge from literary eminence into bankruptcy ; Europe had welcomed him and his family as interesting fugitives , fallen literary royalty of an obverse kind . Then the western world had watched him mount an obsessive journey around it , lecturing in Ceylon and South Africa and other exotic lands to earn his way out of his $100,000 debt . Recovering in Guildford , England , at the end of that year-long ordeal , he had suffered a thunderclap of nearly unendurable grief , a bereavement that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of his life . For a man predisposed to brood on the unstable borders between apparent reality and the cataclysmic demimonde of dreams , the past decade must have seemed at times like a sleep-induced psychosis ; indeed Twain , the childhood sleepwalker , had written compulsively in those years on the theme of dreams as storm-tossed voyages that engulfed and drowned the dreamer . But now he had awakened into a kind of dawn , his ship in the harbor , his dreamvoyage over at last . The welcoming shock of American lightbade fair to bathe him for the remainder of his days . Unless of course the light was beckoning him into the refuge of some new oblivion . There was nothing to do but move toward it . And so on this gusty October Monday , Twain at sixty-four made his way down the crowded gangplank of the Minnehaha , off the Atlantic seas from London , docked in New York harbor . The world was quietly shifting from one order of consciousness to the next . Sigmund Freud 's The Interpretation of Dreams had been published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain read that work , but Freud was aware of Twain , and regarded his work as the leading example of the " highest " form of humor . ) Albert Einstein graduated from Polytechnic Institute of Zrich , Switzerlandhis great theory , completed fifteen years in the future , would give scientific weight to Twain 's metaphysical anarchies . Queen Victoria neared her demiseher era had constrained Mark Twain 's sexual candor but not his gleeful truant wit . Twain , who had confessed in his notebook that the twentieth century was a stranger to him ( he was to be , in ways he would not live to appreciate , among its most profound prophets ) , was walking down the gangplank toward it . " Twain " of course was the necessary artifice , the carefully manufactured persona that the wary man inside kept wrapped ever more tightly about him in public ; soon it was to bloom full and white as the new century 's first pop-cultural icon . The horde on the pier recognized the image at once , and the outcry was worshipful and noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . They 'd taunted him with their sarcasms before ; had him destitute , even reported him dead just three years earlier ( " an exaggeration , " he 'd replied famously ) ; but now they were here to yell out questions and jot dutiful notes . The next day they would tell the nation that " Mark Twain Comes Home , " and would call him " the bravest author in all literature " and " the Hero as Man of Letters , " and compare him to Walter Scott , a writer he detested , but the fellows meant it kindly ; let it go . He put a ruddy smile on his face for the straw-hat reporters and " showed off " a little bit and soon had them laughing and fawning. ( for they , as Twain himself might have written it , were " showing off " too ) . A master mesmerizer of lecture-hall audiences , Twain treated the newsmen to a vintage performance . His gray-blue eagle eyes glinting , he struck a pose of careless lan that seemed magically to banish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos or grief or humiliation tarnished his playful indulgence . " Never looked better , was in splendid humor , " the New York Times assured its readers the following day . " As soon as the author had finished with the salutations of his friends , he was surrounded by a large number of newspaper men and asked for a story of what he had been doing during all the nine years of his absence from his native land . " Genially , as his wife and two surviving daughters looked on , Twain obliged . " Now , that is a long story , but I suppose I must give you something , even if it is in a condensed form , " he drawled . And he began to delight the reporters , this small narrow-shouldered man with the famous tangled eyebrows and heraldic mustache , with fine summonings of Frankfort and the Riviera and Aix-les-Bains .

" Expansively , in the wash of laughter , he continued to embroider the contours of a fabulous idyll . " In the spring of 1895 I came to the United States for a brief stay , crossing the continent from New York to San Francisco , lecturing every night . In October of that year I sailed from Vancouver for Sydney , where I lectured , or , more properly speaking , gave readings from my works to the English-speaking people . I also visited Tasmania and New Zealand ... " He conjured India for them : Bombay and Calcutta . He told them of his arrival at Delagoa Bay , South Africa , in April 1896 . He limned Kimberly , of the fabulous diamond mines ( the source of an old private obsession of Clemens 's ) , and Johannesburg and Cape Town , and of his daring contacts with some principals of the Boer War . " I met Oom Paul , " he casually disclosed , and told them the great Transvaal patriot conformed to his popular image " that beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is a true likeness . " Indifferent to the transient squabbles that divide mankind , he had visited Paul 's imperialist enemies , the famous Jameson raiders , * in their jail . " I told them of the advantages of being in jail . This jail is as good as any other , ' I said , and besides , being in jail has its advantages . A lot of great men have been in jail . If Bunyan had not been put in jail , he would never have written Pilgrim 's Progress . Then the jail is responsible for Don Quixote . So you see being in jail is not so bad , after all . ' Finally I told them that they ought to remember that many great men go through life without ever having been in a jail . " All this time , Twain told the reporters , his family had been with him . After their adventures in Cape Town they had taken a steamer for Southampton .

" Grateful chuckles over this shaft of the famous Twainian foolery ; and now one of the more awestruck newsmen made bold to invoke a topic of nearly celestial magnitudeMark Twain 's rumored autobiography " that is to be published 100 years hence .

You know , I never told the truth in my life that someone did n't say I was lying , while , on the other hand , I never told a lie that somebody did n't take it as fact . " Laughter all around ; and then another questioner , apparently swept away in the lovestruck mood of the moment , cried out : " Well , it 's not wrong , anyway , to tell a lie sometimes , is it ? " " That 's right , exactly right ! " Mark Twain exclaimed . " If you can disseminate facts by telling the truth , why that 's the way to do it , and if you ca n't except by doing a little lying , well , that 's all right , too is n't it ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant nod to the genuflecting newsmen and , allowing himself to be swept up by an entourage of friends and family , strolled off , the New York Times reported , " to locate his baggage . " He strolled , in fact , into an America that wanted to carry his baggage for him , and that would garland him with honors and banquets and worshipful attention for the remaining ten years of his life . Within weeks of his return , his slight , shuffling figure was drawing stares and salutations in theaters and restaurants and the swarm of Fifth Avenue ; he was the first public celebrity in a new century destined to be saturated with them . He manipulated his visibility with the same shrewdness that he 'd summoned to manipulate lecture-hall audiences as a kind of proto-rock star of the 1870s ; a new wardrobe of six white broadcloth suits to match his white mane and mustache , and worn in all seasons and for virtually all occasions , offered the world 's rotogravure sections a distinctive image . He loved white , but his true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; its descriptive term , yet uninvented , was " psychedelic . " " I would like to dress in a loose and flowing costume made all of silks and velvets " he remarked in 1906 , " resplendent with all the stunning dyes of the rainbow , and so would every sane man I have ever known ; but none of us dares to venture it . " A publishing friend soon said of him : " I doubt if there is another man on earth whose name is more familiar . " Common people , the folks who had bought his subscription books from door-to-door salesmen and who now bought the daily papers , felt at ease stopping him and chatting him up . Porters rushed to grab his bags when he traveled . At railroad stations the conductors solemnly held up express trains while Mark Twain relieved himself in the Gents room . The old rivertown urchin strutted among the gods of his time . His friendships had already touched the giants of the nineteenth centuryUlysses S. Grant , Whitman , and Emerson among them . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two months after his return , Twain introduced the twenty-six-year-old Winston Churchill to his first American lecture audience at the Waldorf-Astoria . As the decade progressed he would dine at President Theodore Roosevelt 's White House and hobnob with the future President Woodrow Wilson in Bermuda ; he would gossip and drink with Andrew Carnegie ; he would greet the Russian revolutionary Maxim Gorky with Jane Addams and Finley Peter Dunne ; he would have Helen Keller to dinner . By 1902 his fortune was fully restored : His income exceeded $100,000 . In that year he made a triumphal final visit out west to Hannibal , Missouri , the Mississippi rivertown of his boyhood and the seedbed of his richest imaginings . He posed for photographs by the doorway of the little whiteframe house on Hill Street where the Clemenses had lived for a time , and thus consecrated it . A century later that same dwarfish house , propped upright with reinforcing dowels and framed in the background by a billboard advertising " Mark Twain Fried Chicken , " stood as an official shrine to his memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; oysters and champagne became his regular bill of fare . In 1905 he was toasted at a seventieth-birthday banquet at Delmonico 's that included , among its guests , Willa Cather and Emily Post . ( " If you find you ca n't make seventy by any but an uncomfortable road , " he told the celebrants , " do n't you go . " It was received as a witticism . ) Two years later at Oxford he received an honorary doctorate of letters and met King Edward VII . ( The Queen scolded him to keep his hat on , for fear of him catching cold . ) He also met Sir James Barrie , of Peter Pan fame , and George Bernard Shaw , who called him " by far the greatest American writer . " William Dean Howells , the editor of The Atlantic who was his lifelong friend and ardent reviewer , would exalt him as " the Lincoln of our literature , " and gave him a nickname that another blazing icon of the culture would one day claim : " The King . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whited sepulchre " that he seemed to the world . Beneath his calculated outer wrappings , the small figure descending the Minnehaha gangplank was a Mysterious Stranger , alienated and dream-driven , and the glint in his eye was not public amusement but private fury . A great dark river raged out of control through the vast channels of his being , a river that roiled against the foundations of his past , his friendships , his art ; against mankind , against fate , against the Christian God , and against the fat and grasping nation that even now rushed out dumbly to worship him . A cultural treasure he might have been ; but the Mark Twain reentering America at the opening of the twentieth century had hardened as well into a kind of cultural Antichrist . The manuscripts in his trunk , and the others yet unwritten in his head , would swell against and seek to drown the tinny pieties that his doting host culture held dear , or thought it did . His performance with the welcoming reporters had established the watershed between his public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly , but he had not disseminated all the facts by telling the truth , either . The pierside interview had amounted to a serenely promiscuous gilding , if not an outright revision , of inner reality . The decade and a half just concluded had been progressively disheartening for Samuel Clemens ; the past ten years had all but wrecked his health and the most recent five had pushed him to the borders of insanity . The pressthe worldknew some of this , but by no means all . And in a way peculiar to Mark Twain 's reputation available through his life and his works , the darker dimensions lay , and would remain lying , concealed in plain sight : available as evidence in his novels and essays and memoirs , but discounted somehow , against the blinding glosses of the man himself and the encircling custodians of his legacy . Europe had been a refuge , a continent of sanctuary and cheap lodging where he had fled with his wife Olivia and his daughters Jean and Clara . ( Elegant Susy , his eldest , most literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her education at Bryn Mawr . ) A catastrophic loss of fortune had driven him abroad ; the fortune he had earned as author of celebrated travel books and founder of the Tom Sawyer/Huckleberry Finn mythos . He 'd squandered that wealth by increments during the 1880s through irrational , addictive investments in publishing and in the demonically unworkable Paige typesetting machine . By 1889 , Clemens 's unrecovered payouts to the eccentric putterer James W. Paigewhose invention he 'd imagined would make him a multimillionairehad exceeded $150,000 . Tortured with rheumatism ( his writing arm nearly useless ) and frantic with financial anxiety , Clemens closed down his extravagant house in Hartford in the spring of 1891 . He dismissed the servants and sold off many of the lavish furnishings accumulated over seventeen legendary years as the presiding genius of a storied literary/social enclave that included Charles Dudley Warner and Harriet Beecher Stowe . In June 1891 he and the family left Americafirst for Aix-les-Bains , France , and then on to Germany and Italy and a spacious but inexpensive villa in the hills above Florence . There he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pudd'nhead Wilson , as he 'd blandly informed the reporters , but the process had been at once more nakedly commercial and more heroic than he 'd let on . In Aix-les-Bains , preoccupied with debt , he had labored through his arm pains , trying to generate cash through travel journalism , even switching to his left hand when the agony of motion grew unbearable . That winter an attack of influenza had left him with a permanently damaged lung . It would be yet more months before his inflamed joints allowed him to grasp a pen with his right hand . His output at Florence had been physically prodigious for a man approaching sixty and nursing an afflicted writing arm : nearly two thousand manuscript pages in something under six months . Artistically , it yawed wildly , in quality and intent , forking the polarities of his nature . Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc , stilted and unctuous , would rank among the quaintest of his novels ; he wrote it out of an old clinging piety ( toward women , if not God ) and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been brushed by a windblown page from a Joan of Arc history , and it had awakened his lifelong absorption in medieval life . He had modeled St. Joan 's traits upon his prim daughter Susy , had read aloud from it sonorously at every opportunity , and had thought at first to have it published as an anonymous gift of cultural uplift . Pudd'nhead Wilson , which would prove his last novel of any merit , unsheathed his colder , more modern vision . Begun as a playful piece of mixed-identity farce , it had matured into a flawed but unrelenting satire of man 's flattened moral state and the instability of the human self . " For the next two years I was in France , " he 'd told the reporters , and wisecracked , " I ca n't speak French yet ... " The little jest masked a season of ghastly anxiety . Speaking French was scarcely the point . Sam Clemens spent large draughts of that period sailing between Europe and America . He made eight crossings , begging loans and investments to salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , of course , to feed the curse of the Paige typesetter . In May 1894 Clemens slunk back across the Atlantic to his exiled family in humiliation . Magazine installments of Pudd'nhead Wilson were rekindling a national admiration for him as a literary light , but his finances had now slipped beyond his control . He arrived back in Paris a declared bankrupt , his slide into irretrievable poverty being averted by the guidance of an admiring captain of Standard Oil named Henry Huttleston Rogers . Still he hoped obsessively that Paige could somehow stanch the typesetter 's breakdowns . When that hope collapsed for good early in 1895 , Clemens could see nothing but failure in himself . Life was a dream from which he could not awaken . " In the spring of 1895 I came to the United States for a brief stay , crossing the continent from New York to San Francisco , lecturing every night ... " No , not San Francisco . He 'd ended up swinging well north of California , which he 'd departed a generation before , and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twainian mistake of memory , or a mixing of memory and desire . He had wanted to include his old " heaven-on-the-half-shell " city of bygone newspapering days on this transcontinental barnstorm , but was talked out of it by his agent . In every other respect , the remark was singular for its understatement : Mark Twain 's lecturing sweep of the United States in the summer of 1895 , just months after a near physical collapse , was the first leg of the protean round-the-world platform tourLivy and Clara in towon which ( combined with " Following the Equator , " his literary accounting of it ) he earned the money to pay back his creditors one hundred cents on the dollar . This was the odyssey that allowed him finally to regain financial and spiritual control of his life , and the world recognized it for the heroic gesture it was . As the Clemenses made ready to sail the Pacific from Victoria , B.C. , one newspaper sent them off with this salute : At the age of sixty years Mark Twain manfully faces four sic years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his comforts nor for a heritage to descendants , but to pay debts contracted by a firm of which he was a member ... Without any appeal for sympathy or any suggestion of assistance , keeping away from pathos and avoiding pity , this man of stern honor begins in his old age the same struggle as he once before made . Back in England in August 1896 , in the house at Guildford where he was staying alone . Clemens received a cable telling him : " Susy was peacefully released to-day . " Only twenty-four , she had died of meningitis back home , in the old family house at Hartford . Neither Sam nor Olivia Clemens ever stopped suffering the ache of that loss . Sam tortured himself by grasping at artifacts of her ; he read and reread the biography she had begun of him when she was thirteen . ( " He has the mind of an author exactly , " one passage had gone , " some of the simplest things he ca n't understand . " ) An entry in his own great disheveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is one of the mysteries of nature that a man , all unprepared , can receive a thunder-stroke like that and live . " This , then , was the accounting beneath the accounting ; the essence of the dark twin concealed beneath the amiable lion of American letters who disembarked from the Minnehaha in New York harbor on October 15 , 1900 . Mark Twain , the figure in white , would reign over his mechanizing , urbanizing culture almost as a living statue through the new century 's ambiguous first decadea comforting symbol of the accelerating nation 's virtue , its unbroken connection with its arcadian , small-town ( in certain ways feudal ) past . A self- " petrification , " to use a favorite term of Twain'sone he employed only in the service of undeviating contempt . Unobserved by the enveloping entourage of friends and family was the man entirethe dream-ridden , river-tossed world wanderer out of the old Interior , a purer product of America in his gorgeous flaws and terrible genius than most of his celebrants would ever want to consider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation : exploitative appetite , an irreducible nativism that endured despite his travels , an uncritical faith in technical progress and the perfectability of man 's nature via the machine . As a writer he had seldom shown concern for the received aesthetic demands of his craft . Form inconvenienced him ; bother form ; a Twain book , especially a Twain novel , went drifting like a river , from change to change , until it ended . Likewise consistency of tone , or consistency of anything : He would be uproarious one minute , maudlin the next , turgidly " historical " the moment after that , and then the writerly voice might disappear utterly into a Cheshire smile of reportage . The characters in his novels could be shockingly cardboard , grown-up ones especially and grown-up females most especially of all . In this , too , he was distinctly American ; form , the nuances of character and the edgy implications of gender were worse than precious ; they were downright French . But his genius was distinctly American as well , the raw , improvising genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius lay partly in his way of either adjusting his flaws to accommodate reality , or else melding them into the service of his art . His self-liberation from high European style ( except when he was lampooning it ) gave him room to write U.S. English in as pristine and stripped-down a way as it had ever been written , especially when he was replicating speech ; and this in turn made him the fountainhead of modern U.S. literature . His most characteristic modehumor in its many varietiesbetrayed his American stamp more than anything else . Twain had lived long enough to have experienced New World humor in its still-forming , unconsecrated state , and in that state it was seldom merely funny ; more often it was a densely accumulating series of myths and metaphors for rationalizing chaos . Men and women of the frontier had traded in humorous archetypesa kind of diplomatic folk-languagein order to understand and safely negotiate the backwoods country 's extreme religiosity , its uncontrollable violence , and the many deadly gradations between the two . More than one commentator remarked on Twain 's preternatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and some people thought he actually never spoke or wrote in deliberate jest at all . " He was an American ; that is , an unfathomably solemn man , " ventured G.K. Chesterton , who also found him " serious to the point of madness . " Even his unfailing booster Howells cited " the profoundly serious , the almost tragical strain " that was the fundamental tone of the Southwestern culture from which Twain sprang . Still , the man could get a laugh . But now as Twain returned scarred and grieving to America , the locus of his humor had shifted to a place outside the limits of his own petrifying canon . " For several years I have been intending to stop writing for print as soon as I could afford it . At last I can afford it , " he had written to Howells while still in England . And while he would not abandon " for print " entirely , he plunged now with avidity into his newly defined subject-matter . " It is under way now , &; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual drunk ... " W. D. Howells knew " Clemens " ( as he always insisted on calling him ) for forty-six years . He probably knew Mark Twain better than any other human being , with the possible exception of Olivia . Among the most fundamental and unqualified pronouncements Howells would ever make was that his friend " had the soul of a boy . " ( Olivia would seem to have agreedher pet name for her husband was " Youth . " ) Now , it seemed , the aging boy 's subject-matter , the substance of his intellectual drunk , was to be man ; was to be mankind ; was to be the loss of Mark Twain 's pride and respect for mankind . He wrote furiously now out of a hot dark private place , where men are trapped on monstrous voyages inside drops of rainwater ; where angels mock the works of a conscienceless God ( whose motto read , " Let no innocent person escape " ) ; where mankind 's " Moral Sense " is shown inferior to the base instincts of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sham and men are nothing more than self-deceiving machines ; where a malign Source of All Etiquette can exterminate the house of Baasha for the crime of pissing against the wall . This new sulfurous strain of humor knew no limits of blasphemy whatsoever : it even imagined the game of baseball as a sport in which the batsman , " in the fullness of time , " " did lay the Umpire dead , " and then was himself annihilated by a beanball that cracked his skull . No more the self-kidding of his old California newspapering days , no more the indulgent manners-and-morals humor of the great set pieces in the travel books , no more the brilliant explosions of rendered vernacular , no more the containable naughtiness of his immortalizing boyhood novels . ( It would still be some decades before the critics pried loose the more subversive visions embedded in those . ) His endearing public writings were all behind him now . Ahead lay the full discharge of the pen warmed up in hell . The world received a sampling of this heat six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and Livy into a townhouse on West Tenth Streetan area that would become famous among midcentury artists as Greenwich Village . On New Century 's Eve , he unveiled what he called " A Salutation Speech from the Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth taken down in shorthand by Mark Twain " in the December 31 edition of the New York Herald : I bring you the stately matron named Christendom , returning bedraggled , besmirched and dishonored from pirate raids in Kiao-Chow , Manchuria , South Africa , the Philippines , with her soul full of meanness , her pocket full of boodle and her mouth full of pious hypocrisies . Give her soap and a towel , but hide the looking-glass . That was for practice . A month later , Twain shocked his public by unleashing all , concerning that subject , that was on his mind . He chose the February North American Review , an unassailably stately journal of opinion , for a corrosive assault against American highhandedness in the Far East . Modeled vaguely on Swift 's " A Modest Proposal , " and laced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Person Sitting in Darkness " mocked the false pieties that had attended the recent coercive demands by United States missionaries upon the Chinese following the Boxer rebellion . The screed ended with nothing less than an early-century version of a flag-burning : his suggestion that the American flag be repainted black and its field of stars replaced by a skull and crossbones . For a while , the creamy banquets and the polemic bursts alternated in an uneasy tension . Luxury and radicalism coexistedvalidating the insight of Howells , who called him a theoretical socialist and a practical aristocrat . After moving to a large rented house in fashionable Riverdale in the autumn of 1901 , Mark Twain joined the Anti-Imperialist League , which was monitoring the Philippine situation . So did Howells ; they both served as vice presidents . Twain threw in with the activist Society of Acorns and helped them turn public opinion against an enclave of rascals from the Tammany Hall machine . Writing to Harper 's Weekly in 1905 in the voice of Satan , Twain excoriated the philanthropies of John D. Rockefeller as " conscience-money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given that Rockefeller 's Standard Oil colleague , Henry H. Rogers , had recently saved the author from the poorhouse . Perhaps that incongruity was on Twain 's mind when an ingratiating friend remarked to him that the Rogers wealth was " tainted , " and Twain snapped back : " Yes . ' Tai n't yours , and ' tai n't mine . " ) Such polemical firebursts made a public stir , influencing the political thinking of the decade and creating , temporarily at least , an altered image of Americana 's great white father . Yet neither the firebursts ( the public ones , anyway ) nor the new image was destined to endure . By the time Halley 's Comet , which had hovered over his birth in 1835 , came round again to reclaim him on April 21 , 1910 , the overheated old man had slipped back into the comfort of his nation 's damp embrace . He died beloved and was laid to rest in one of his white suits " humorist. " aphorist , family patriarch , valiant traveler , enduring poet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riding the comet into the next world , Mark Twain was still performing , still fooling the press . And still the cultural Antichrist underneath . All of this might suggest that by the end of his life , Mark Twain had voyaged irretrievably far from the memories and the qualities of temperament that had infused his canonical works : The Innocents Abroad , Roughing It , Life on the Mississippi , and especially his signature " boys ' " novels , The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . It might suggest that Twain in the tortured final decade-and-a-half of his life had in some elemental sense ceased being Mark Twain at all , or at least had ceased being the Samuel Langhorne Clemens whose early lifehis boyhood and youth in Hannibal , on the great river and in the far western territorieshad given Twain his mythic stature and the canonical works their content . This has remained , roughly , the assumption of many of his readersand many more of his nonreadersin the century since his death : that after a sunny , pastoral boyhood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyhood ever lived , " in the phrasing of Justin Kaplan ) , followed by an idyllic , dream-come-true adventure as a Mississippi River steamboat pilot and some prospecting and newspapering exploits in the West , Mark Twain settled in to an extended career as a fond memoirist and novelist , then grew old , grew unaccountably alienated and " bitter , " and died . The popular-cultural consensus , especially among the many commercial marketers and theme-park packagers of his image , has been to focus on the sunlit tales and aphorisms of Twain the " humorist , " and leave Twain the bewildering dark prophet to his convenient obscurity . Twain 's own inner circle collaborated in this smothering , sterilizing legacy . The chief perpetrators were Clara and his genuflective first biographer and literary executor , Albert Bigelow Paine . To a lesser extent , Twain was muted by his astute and worshipful , but fatally Victorian chum Howells . Howells , plump and humid , is the least suitable object of blame ; without Howells and his passionate effusions stretching across forty years , there might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American literature . It was Howells , among the " serious " critics , who had first paid attention to Twain in 1869 , Howells who swept the rough-edged westerner into respectability among the New England literary elite . But it was also Howells who gave Twain a discrete nudge now and then regarding the limits of good taste , and it was Howells who in 1883 had sent Twain a strong signal about the suitability of his more searing childhood memories . " Do n't let anyone see those passages , " he implored his friend about a particularly morbid anecdote in the manuscript of Orion Clemens 's autobiographywhich went unpublished and eventually was lost . Clara was the most vigilant suppressor of her father 's unbridled imaginings . The middle of the three daughters , and not the favorite , she was the last to survive her father and influenced his legacy until her own death at eighty-eight in 1962 . She had trained for a career in music , excelling at voice and the piano , but caring for her invalid mother , her aging icon of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd repaired to a sanitorium in 1904 after her mother 's death . Recovering , she took on the role of managing her father 's household and , more tellingly , his wholesome " humorist " image . ( She 'd found his taste in white suits vulgar . ) After Twain 's death , Clara hovered over the process of any book published about him , suppressing photos she did n't like ( including some of her dad with members of his " Angelfish " club ) and the entire contents of Letters from the Earth until after her own death . Clara found a malleable ally in the fastidious Paine . A dapper , starch-collared Iowan , sometime photographer , and writer of children 's books , Paine had attached himself to the old writer after having met him several times in the early 1900s , including the seventieth birthday fete at Delmonico 's . In 1906 he boldly sought and immediately received Twain 's permission to write his biography . From that time until the end , Paine virtually merged his identity with Twain 's , indulging him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , even going so far as to retrace the author 's voyage to the Holy Land that had resulted in The Innocents Abroad . As Paine scrutinized his subject , Clara scrutinized Paine . She would make sure that this biographer betrayed no hint of her father 's dark side . In the event , there was no serious conflict ; the two of them were equally determined to enforce a sanitized , sentimental perception of Twain that had no place for satanic angels , hellacious dreamvoyages , degraded Moral Senses , or pissing against the wall . Paine 's three-volume , half-million-word study , Mark Twain , a Biography : The Personal and Literary Life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens , was published in 1912 . Exhaustive and valuable in many ways , it fatally suppressed the brimstone . And Paine 's damage to his subject 's legacy extended well beyond his prim and proper biography . As literary executor , he maintained control of those unpublished papers for a crucial quarter-century after Twain 's death . His selections of material for publication were invariably skewed by his and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine actually meddled in the workabridging Twain 's letters , even rewriting ( and bowdlerizing ) passages of " The Mysterious Stranger " ( published in 1916 ) without disclosing his interventions .
