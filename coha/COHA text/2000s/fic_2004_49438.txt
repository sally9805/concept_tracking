IF YOU ASK ME FOR A STORY on a night like this , when the wind howls through the canyons like a live thing , there 's only one I can tell . I know well when I 've gone up to bed , some of you will whisper that I 'm just an old and crazy widow who should , by rights , be dead by now . How well I understand that there are truths too frightening to believe . But truths these are . The events I recount to you now have haunted me every windy night for more decades than I care to number - since the days when gold and silver mines were the lifeblood of this town , and evil could be recognized and felt and guarded against , or so we thought . Bring me that quilt . Stoke up the fire , and I 'll begin . <p> The year was 1905 , just barely , for it was mid-January when Jesse took me on our first outing to the old Pahpocket Mine and its fabulous sentinel . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest , and families were leaving in a slow , steady trickle . Nobody knew whether the community would pull through or not . If the town had been a human being , a doctor would have advised making out a will and setting things in order , for the situation seemed grave . <p> It was a sad and frightening time for all of us . Certainly , it was for Jesse and me . We had only been married a couple of years . Ten months of that , we had spent here in the desert , eighty miles from nowhere , because Jesse was a mining engineer fresh out of college . He 'd had several job possibilities , but Pactolus won because the Double Silver Company offered us a house along with his pay - a big house , and we wanted lots of children . Now the town was dying . <p> I felt as if I were dying , too . I had just lost the third of our babies , a little boy who had arrived much too early and stillborn . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own heart for fear of what I 'd find there . The Pactolus cemetery seemed awash in dead babies , not just mine , but everyone else 's , too , and sometimes their mothers as well . I could n't speak to God anymore , though I did n't understand why . If I had n't been trying so hard not to feel anything , I 'd have realized I was furious at Him . <p> On this particular January day , a Saturday , the air was unseasonably warm - " a January thaw , " the old-timers said . And Jesse , shaving shirtless at the washbowl , glad for the feel of fresh air on his skin , turned and caught me up in his arms and said , " Kezzie , let me take you on a picnic . It 'll do you good . You do n't have to work . Just sit . I 'll put up a basket myself , if you 're willing to eat squashed sandwiches . " He smiled like a child . Oh , how we loved each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread it with a patchwork from the previous night 's chicken dinner that he 'd heard of a spot that sounded interesting . The abandoned Pahpocket Mine . <p> So I put on an old skirt . The roads were knee-deep in mud and I did n't want to ruin one of my good ones . Jesse saddled up Tailings , our horse , and we rode double and slowly through the sagebrush and junipers to the Pahpocket . As we plodded along with the warm sun on our shoulders , Jesse told me what Davey , an old miner he knew , had related to him about the place . <p> Forty years before , the Pahpocket Mine had been one of the richest in the country . It was , as well , the deepest in history as far as anyone knew , and there should have been many who knew , for the entire state was aswarm with mining experts in those days . The miners were following a vein of gold ore that seemed to lead down and down , growing ever wider and richer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something big went wrong , and almost all of the 150 men in the tunnels that day were killed . The details of the disaster were sketchy , Jesse said . Whatever happened was so unusual that the whole incident lay cocooned in legend and rumor . The survivors ( there were very few ) spoke of things no sane person believed . The mine had come to life . Or the miners had pierced the heart of darkness , and it had devoured them in retribution . All the machinery stopped at once - the air compressors , the big water pump , the man skips - and could not be restarted . Men were sucked bodily into the void , seven thousand feet down . Rescue parties disappeared . Not a single body was ever recovered . <p> Clucking softly to urge Tailings over a hillock , Jesse finished the story . " Davey says the owners tried to clean things up and reopen it , but they never managed to . Nobody would go down there anymore , not even the Chinamen , and you know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cursed . Those Cornish miners , you could understand them hanging back . But the Chinese ? Now that 's saying something . " <p> Tailings trotted us over a rise , and there in a hollow at the foot of a hill , we saw what was left of the Pahpocket Mine . <p> Even as little time as I 'd spent in mining country , I knew the place did not look right , considering the supposed size of the operation . True , there was a conical mountain of gray detritus , steep in its angle of repose , the guts of the Earth brought up yard by square yard . And the vicinity was scattered with the usual array of massive , rusted equipment . But , strangely , there were no intact buildings , just twisted heaps of corrugated tin . Even the head frame lay in ruins . <p> Because of this the main shaft gaped darkly from the hillside . The main shafts of the big mines I had seen were always obscured by housings and equipment . So exposed , this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dentures out . I felt as if I had no business looking . <p> Yet I could n't turn my gaze . For directly in front of this huge , empty mouth sat an incongruous , bone-pale figure of tufa stone , twice as tall as a man . <p> We dismounted from the horse and I walked up for a better look , so astonished that I forgot to hold up the hem of my skirt , which was quickly soaked in snow melt . It was difficult to say whether the thing was just a piece of rock with an unnatural shape , or had been crudely carved somehow . Though I looked hard , I did n't find a single mark that could be said , without doubt , to have been made by a tool . I knew that tufa sometimes takes amazing and unlikely shapes with no human help at all , but this defied probability . <p> It did n't fit any easy description . Its great knob of a head seemed part lion and part man , though shapes like long , wolfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdress , or perhaps a thick , straight mane out of which peeked small misshapen creatures . Its seated body curved cougarlike , except for its legs , which might have been a horse 's , or might have been a dog 's . Its feet , encircled by oddly incongruous rusted iron chains , were half hidden beneath smaller versions of itself . Wings - which might once have had stone feathers - swept along its sides , though they were lumpish and asymmetrical . It faced not outward , toward the world , but inward , toward the mine , its neck arched back and its gaze turned skyward as if it longed to be gone from the Earth . <p> " What is it ? " I said as Jesse came up behind me , carrying the picnic basket . <p> " They say it 's an Indian version of a gargoyle . Set there to guard forever against the evil in the mine . " He laughed , confident in the silliness of the story . " After the accident , Wuzzie Stovepipe and her tribe hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paid the driver in gold , too . " <p> I knew something of Wuzzie Stovepipe - an ancient local Paiute woman who haunted the streets of town , dressed in a rabbitskin cloak and a hat made of magpie feathers . Many Indians we never knew , because they preferred the cleanliness and freedom of the desert and never came near Pactolus . Most of those we did know spent their time begging outside the saloon or drinking themselves stupid in the alleyways . But never Wuzzie . Wherever she went , she walked purposefully . Something in the way she carried herself , or the look in her black , black eyes , made men doff their hats and women nod in deference as she passed . I had felt the same impulse myself - shivering as we crossed paths outside the mercantile or the butcher shop . <p> I knew , too , that Niminaa Lake was many miles away . The stone figure was massive , and must have required a dozen or more mules to pull it so far . Where would an old Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh along with Jesse , but it came out forced . A strange certainty was building inside me , a kind of high-pitched resonance that began in the soles of my feet and rushed upward through my heart , a current of compassion for the dead men , or love , and surely gratitude to Wuzzie and her people , because I was convinced at that moment that the monstrous effigy was indeed protecting us from something . <p> I felt so overwhelmed that black spots swarmed before my eyes , and I lost my footing . The next instant , I found my face pressed against that strange , forbidding figure . The rough stone scratched my cheek . The tufa was slightly warm , from the desert sun I supposed , which can be strong even in winter . It had a disconcertingly good smell , perhaps because it was damp from thawing snow - powerful with potential like soil in spring . Even as I recoiled from it , I felt so oddly comforted that tears spilled down my cheeks . <p> It was the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . Jesse rushed to smooth my hair and whisper hushes in my ear , hugging me from behind . There I stood and wept a torrent , pressed between my husband and the palpable shield of the gargoyle , if that 's what it was , finally able to begin the long process of releasing my grief . <p> A FEW WEEKS LATER , the clergyman from the Episcopalian church , Father Marshall , came to call . I invited him in . <p> Balancing a cup of tea and the last of our sugar biscuits on his knee , he said , " Mrs. Mayhew , I know you 've had a difficult time these last few months . You 've been in our prayers . So you need n't answer my question right away . But the mayor has sent me to ask if you might consider becoming our school teacher . " <p> I was silent for a minute . The request was so unexpected it took a while to sink in . " But I thought we already had one , " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter was too hard for her . " <p> Yes , I thought . Deep snow and wind like a bitter fist . Half the mines played out , and nothing in the town to show for it except widows and fatherless children . People too depressed to speak to each other . The doctor gone . No library . No culture . The arrival of a single bolt of calico at the mercantile was cause for celebration , and the mail took two weeks , sometimes three , in each direction . Oh yes , I understood how a woman might find the winter too hard . <p> " What makes the mayor think I 'm suitable for the position ? " I asked . <p> Father Marshall smiled . " I approve of your modesty , " he said . " But we understand you 've been to college in the East . You are undoubtedly the most educated woman in Pactolus . And , well , it did occur to me that you might welcome some occupation just now . To keep from dwelling on your troubles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> I found myself returning his smile . Though I 'd never taught before , the idea appealed to me . " I 'll think it over , " I said . <p> " We 'd be grateful . " Father Marshall stood to leave , and as I showed him to the door , he added , " It need n't be permanent unless you want it to be . I hope you 'll accept . " <p> I did think it over , but it did n't take me very long to arrive at a decision . He was right . Having been educated at Barnard and having traveled a little , I was an unusual woman in this remote place . I had no children of my own . I had nothing to do with my time but fuss around the house , bake things that used too much of our precious sugar , and replace the occasional lost button . It would feel good to be useful . And we could certainly stand the extra money , given that I 'd married for love against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all we had . <p> The next morning , I agreed to take the job , and a side of Pactolus I 'd never seen before opened up to me . <p> I doubt there is any better way to know a town than to spend your days rubbing elbows with its children . The Pactolus school house was built to accommodate thirty students , but there were only eighteen that spring . Just as well , since I was as busy learning as they were . <p> The youngest was six , and the oldest a towering sixteen . There were eleven girls , most of them well mannered and eager to please . And there were seven boys , all of them problems of one kind or another . There were Jesus and Xavier , a sheepherder 's sons who barely spoke English and seemed never to have touched books before . There were Phinney , Doyle , and Quince , who ranged in age from ten to thirteen , full of wild energy and thoughtless cruelty . Phinney 's father ran a bar , Doyle 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miner - was dead . <p> Then there were Nev Treleaven and Jacques Dechain , whom this story is really about - whose fates , as it turned out , were enmeshed with each other 's , with the Pahpocket Mine , and with its strange guardian . <p> Nev looked to be thirteen or fourteen years old , dark of hair but fair of skin , with eyes like the sea off the Cote d'Azur . He sometimes sat outside the schoolroom and listened beside the window , but refused to come in . He told me once , after half an hour 's coaxing , that he did n't like being in the school . It was too hot and small and full of people 's smells . He could n't breathe . Claustrophobia , I suppose . Indeed , he seemed half feral . More than once , I saw him running through the brush like an antelope or a mustang , for no apparent reason beyond the joy of it . <p> I asked about him at the mercantile whose proprietor , Mr. Oxoby , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my astonishment , that Wuzzie Stovepipe was the only mother Nev Treleaven had ever known . Oxoby said Nev 's mother died giving birth to him . Nev 's father , Dub , a taciturn miner raised in the hardrock country of Cornwall , was so entirely shattered by her death that he became a recluse , spending most of his time alone in the nearby hills . He was often gone for weeks at a time and would reappear in town with a bag of gold nuggets , or a wagon full of high-grade silver ore . Most people thought he must have a rich mining claim somewhere , but no one knew for certain . <p> Mr. Treleaven had made arrangements with Wuzzie shortly after his wife 's death . The woman was to care for little Nevlin and mother him to the best of her abilities , in return for which she was compensated with gold , though Mr. Oxoby whispered behind his hand that there might be compensations other than gold , if I took his meaning - which I did , with a grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised by a Paiute explained a lot about his behavior , and also about the way the other children treated him . They seemed frightened of him . I say this because they never teased him or made him the brunt of jokes to his face . They kept a rather respectful distance . But whenever they thought he was n't looking , they called him a half-breed and a queer duck . They blamed every outbreak of head lice on him , even though he never had any physical contact with any of them and smelled better than some . They said his Indian mother had taught him black magic . Every piece of bad luck was a " Nev 's curse . " Nev was even blamed for big storms . <p> In short , he was an outcast , though he was probably the kindest and most attentive child in Pactolus . I have thought often about the reasons for this ostracism , down through the long years I 've spent here . People always fear the unfamiliar , and Nev was certainly that - unknown and unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark hours after midnight , a conviction rises in my mind unbidden : perhaps Nev Treleaven was outcast with good reason , for he was not entirely human . How else could the events I 'm about to relate be explained ? <p> Jacques Dechain , on the other hand , was more human than most . <p> His family did not arrive in Pactolus until March of that year - two months after I began teaching . They were from Paris . Professor Dechain had taken a leave from the Sorbonne to do archeological research on a group of unusual petroglyphs someone found in a narrow canyon on the far side of Niminaa Lake . Jacques was at that time the Dechains ' only child . He was twelve , though I guessed ten when I first met him , not because he was small - he was about average height , and somewhat stocky - but because of the way he behaved . He had a quality of sweet dreaminess that led him to see the distant mountains as sleeping dragons and himself as a brave knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nev had one thing in common , their difference from the others . Jacques spoke technically perfect English , though with a heavy , florid accent . The girls liked it , and Jesus and Xavier , who struggled with English themselves , did n't seem to notice it . But Phinney , Doyle , and Quince pranced around imitating it and roaring with laughter . In fact , they mocked him at every chance . They implied that he was a pansy because he wrote in lovely , well-practiced script . They made fun of his lunch , which his mother packed beautifully with linen napkin , silverware , and china plate . They even made fun of his name . <p> Boys of this sort seemed entirely outside Jacques 's experience . He had no idea how to deal with them . He had virtually no sense of humor , and what he did have was utterly foreign to the other children . He did n't know how to fight , or how to deflect a taunt with sharp wit . So he became angry , or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal and hoped-for response , the bullies stole the leather-bound books of French philosophy with which he tried to impress them . He wore an unlikely hat of heavy , pale felt with a dandyish curve to the brim , and this they gleefully grabbed and threw into the mud . They sniped at him with tiny , stinging pebbles from their slingshots . They put horse manure inside his desk . Their imaginations knew no bounds when it came to tormenting Jacques . <p> I tried my best to protect him , but I could n't hover over him every minute of the day , or keep watch when school was not in session . Besides , that only embarrassed him further . I did speak to his parents about the problem over tea one afternoon , but it did n't seem to help much . In the end , the best I could do was forbid the taunting during school hours , teach the children a little French , and hope the boys would work things out among themselves . <p> MEANWHILE , I had discovered that Father Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and preoccupation with other people were at work within me , as I 'm sure he suspected they would be . My grief over the loss of our son , which I had carried in my heart all winter like the wound from a dark , bloody bullet , began at last to heal . <p> Healing is a strange thing , sometimes painful in itself , and sometimes hard to recognize for what it is . As spring progressed toward summer and the days lengthened , urges that I could neither explain nor understand overcame me . I felt a great need to wander the hills alone , where I could weep and wail as much as I wanted without fear of discovery . <p> I spent many afternoons that season walking through the brush fast and hard with only the most trivial of goals - a glitter on a distant hillside , an abandoned shack rising from the yellow-tipped scrub , an interesting rock formation . All the while my pain broke and rose like river ice in a thaw . <p> One such afternoon , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pahpocket mine . Though I had recalled the figure often since January , I had only seen it that once with Jesse . I think I was half afraid of it , or of the black hole it guarded . <p> But on this day , I felt an almost lunatic need to find it again , to touch it , and to reassure myself that we were still safe and life would go on , for some of us at least . So I set off for the Pahpocket . I was tight and desperate inside myself at first , as always when I began these walks . But the day was bright and warm , the air tinged with the resinous scent of sage blossoms and the hum of hardy bees . I could see for miles with perfect clarity - desolate gray-green hills , stark shadows , stone outcroppings - and the longer I walked , the more beautiful it all seemed . <p> By the time I reached the Pahpocket , I was in what I had come to think of as my desert state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings . I came over the crest of the hillock before the mine and discovered , to my surprise , that I was not the only one thinking of the stone figure that day . Jacques and Nev stood beside the thing , talking . <p> I was n't quite close enough to hear what they were saying . And it seemed probable that Nev would fade away like smoke if he knew I was anywhere near . So , curiosity overcoming scruples , I crept among the boulders and clumps of sage till I reached a hidden rocky niche perfect for eavesdropping . <p> " It has a powerful name . Nimitseahpah . The Paiutes never say it aloud . They only whisper it , same as the old miners , " I heard Nev say . <p> Jacques slapped the statue with the flat of his hand , as one might slap the flank of a favorite horse . He jerked away slightly , as if surprised at the way the stone felt , but unwilling to show it . " I 've seen a lot of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A piece of stone with a silly face . They 're everywhere in Paris . " <p> Even from my distance , it sounded like false bravado . Or maybe I was just biased , for I remembered well the last time I had touched that pale figure . Nimitseahpah , I whispered to myself , savoring it , only at that moment realizing that I had been yearning to call the guardian by name . <p> " You 're wrong , " said Nev . " It 's more than a stone . They put it here to hold back the darkness the miners disturbed . It has power . Ca n't you feel it ? " <p> Jacques blinked and hesitated a moment before shaking his head almost stubbornly . " Feel it ? What am I supposed to feel ? " <p> Nev chewed at his lip , trying to explain something that seemed difficult for him . " The place where the light meets the darkness . The balance . It feels like ... like the afternoon before a storm . A hum . Inside you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost disdainful this time , Jacques said , " Is this a joke ? " <p> Nev gazed at him calmly . " No . " <p> Jacques kicked at one of the chains that adorned the figure 's feet . Nev 's cheek twitched . <p> " Phinney and Doyle say you 're crazy , Treleaven . Maybe it 's true . " <p> Laughing softly , Nev answered as he often did - with a question of his own . " They say you 're a mamma 's boy . Is that true ? " <p> Jacques 's face turned bright red , and he clenched both fists at his sides , his mouth working though no words came out . <p> Nev regarded him with an odd expression , somewhere between a frown and a smile . " They know you hate them . So they hate you back . " <p> Words burst from Jacques at last . " I would n't hate them if they treated me better ! Ca n't you see ? " <p> " Does n't matter . You ca n't make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You are crazy ! " said Jacques , and he laughed . It sounded almost like a bark . " They hate you , too , you know . " <p> Nev looked off into the far distance , where the Desatoya mountains rose , purplish in the afternoon light . There was no longer any trace of a smile on his face . " No . They do n't hate me . They fear me . I 'm not like them . I 'm not like anybody . " <p> " I do n't fear you , " said Jacques , pulling himself up straight , looking insulted . <p> " You will , " said Nev . <p> Without another word , he turned and began to walk away , out into the brush . <p> " Where are you going ? " cried Jacques . <p> But Nev did not respond . His easy pace turned into a lope , and within seconds , he was gone from sight . <p> Jacques bellowed . It was n't a word ; just an angry shout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he threw it into the mine shaft with the might of blind fury . The bang and rattle of its fall lasted a long time . <p> The next day was May 2 , 1905 . A Tuesday . The date occupies a permanent place in my mind , as if burned there , or incised with a chisel . The dawn was clear , the morning unseasonably warm . The birds were silent and invisible , the noise of insects incessant . <p> Even before I rang the school bell , I knew it would be a difficult day . Tessie Penryn and her best friend Beth Young had a highly uncharacteristic hair-pulling fight on the playground over possession of a carved wooden horse . <p> I discovered Phinney hunched behind the fence in tears . His father , who slept late because of the hours he kept at the bar , had beaten him for making too much noise at breakfast . I helped him clean up at the hand pump , but no amount of soap and water could wash the bruises from his face , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out on Jacques . Phinney began by needling him about his accent , an old refrain to be sure , but on this day there was a new twist to the cruelty . Phinney swore at Jacques in French . This he had learned to do from Jacques himself , which I 'm sure added injury to insult . Moreover , given Phinney 's gift for mimicry , he did it abominably well . Quince and Doyle took up the chorus with great relish . <p> Everyone was out of sorts . The children bickered like sparrows at a feeder , and my patience gave way to sharp retorts more than once . I felt the tension , too , as if static electricity were building everywhere - in the rocks , in the sky , in the air between people , headed for the inevitable shock of discharge . <p> By two o'clock , a bank of ugly black clouds had appeared low in the sky southwest of town . Not long after , the Terrible Trio smeared a wad of juniper pitch into Jacques 's hair . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom while I tried to get the sticky mess cleaned up . Jacques was in furious tears , and I had just resorted to scissors , when the door flew open with a crash . <p> We all looked toward it , shocked at the sudden noise . There stood Nev , the clouds gray and swirling behind him . The smell of dampened dust and sage drifted in on the breeze , an odor peculiar to the high desert , one that makes the hair on my neck rise to this day . It means there is rain not far off . <p> Nev was trembling visibly . " Big storm coming , " he said . " Take shelter . " Then he was gone again , running fast toward the center of town . <p> Before the door had closed , many of the children leapt from their desks into the aisles , babbling . There were even a few shrieks . I picked up a ruler and smacked it against my own desk . The noise got their attention , at least for a second or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , " I said in my firmest teacherly voice . <p> " But Mrs. Mayhew , when Nev talks about storms , he 's always right . Even my dad says so , " said Sally Deidesheimer . She was usually so shy and quiet that this was the longest sentence I had ever heard her say . <p> Jesus , the sheepherder 's towering son , stood up then . Gazing steadfastly at the floor , he removed his crumpled felt hat from his back pocket , pulled it onto his head , and said , " Meesus Mayhew , I got ta go tell Aita . I big sorry . " With that , he grabbed his little brother Xavier and ran outside to find their horse . <p> After that , there was no stopping any of them . In moments , the room was empty . I stood in the open doorway , looking out . The breeze had picked up and the temperature was falling rapidly . The sky was a deep , bruised gray . The scent of coming rain permeated everything . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin into goose flesh . <p> On the playground , Jacques Dechain , still nearly blind with fury , his hair sticking up in wild , pitch-stiffened spikes , had chosen this moment to exact revenge . He had managed to grab Quince 's slingshot from its accustomed spot in Quince 's back pocket . And he was shooting stones at his three enemies as quickly as he could pick them up . Most of his efforts went astray . I do n't think he 'd ever held a slingshot before , let alone practiced with one . But one pebble nicked Phinney on the cheek , leaving a shallow , bloody trail there below the eye his father had blackened that morning . It was more than Phinney could bear . <p> " I 'll kill you , you little pansy bastard ! " he screamed . <p> " Try it ! Try it , I dare you ! " cried Jacques . He took one last wild shot at Phinney with Quince 's slingshot . It went wide , but before it landed , he was already running off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " And he and Quince and Doyle sped after Jacques in a way that looked serious indeed . <p> I called for them to stop , but they either did n't hear me or did n't care to . <p> So I hitched my skirt around my knees in a fashion that probably would have made Father Marshall apoplectic , and ran after them through the rising wind . <p> Jacques was a fairly good runner - not in Nev 's league , but a good runner nonetheless . He ran with balance , dodging whatever clumps of sagebrush he could n't leap . And at first he was swift , opening a considerable gap between himself and his pursuers . But he did n't have their endurance . Slowly the distance narrowed . I was becoming winded , too , when I realized where he was leading us . <p> I lost sight of Jacques first . Then Phinney , Doyle and Quince , who were well ahead of me , too . But it did n't matter . I knew where they were going . I topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood beside the misshapen stone figure , so out of breath that his sides heaved . Above his head , he held a rock so big I wondered how he 'd ever had the strength to move it , let alone pick it up . His face was contorted with the effort of holding it aloft . <p> The other boys had stopped a respectful distance from him . <p> I shouted at them as I slipped down the hill toward the mine , but by then the wind was blowing in earnest , grabbing at our hair and clothes , peppering us with grit . And it carried my voice in the wrong direction . <p> As I got closer , I heard Doyle shout at Jacques , " Are you crazy ? " <p> Jacques was in such a state that he was screaming at them in French . They could n't understand him , but he did n't seem to notice , and even if he had , I think he was beyond caring . But I knew French well from my studies at college and from traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Roughly translated , he was saying that he would fix them once and for all , and they would see who killed who . <p> " Stop it at once ! " I shouted as I ran toward them . <p> Phinney turned toward me , his mouth open , and said , " Mrs. Mayhew ? " clearly shocked to see me there . <p> " Yes ! Jacques , put the rock down ! " I said . <p> But poor Jacques Dechain had been driven far past his breaking point . Tears streamed down his cheeks , and he laughed crazily . " I 'll make you so sorry ! " he cried , still in French . " I 'll set it free . I 'll make you so sorry ! " <p> He turned toward the statue and all at once I saw clearly what he meant to do . There was something in the mine that could kill people in a moment . And Nimitseahpah was all that stood between Jacques and that power . <p> Who knows where Nev came from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had done before . Or maybe he knew somehow what was happening at the Pahpocket . The children said he spoke the language of the wind , that it told him things no one else could understand . <p> Quite suddenly , he was lunging toward Jacques , shouting , " No ! No ! " <p> He literally flung himself through the air . I had already launched myself in Jacques 's direction , too . I fell short , tumbling into the windblown dirt . Nev did not . He hit Jacques broadside , knocking him off his feet . But he was an instant too late . The massive rock had already left Jacques 's hands . There was a hollow popping sound . I felt a sharp pain somewhere behind my eyes . I watched as the porous tufa of our guardian shattered , the anguished head leaving the obscene body , the body severed from the legs and their heavy shackles , in a spray of pale dust and inexplicable , brilliant light . Grief pierced me like a spear . I swear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nights when the wind blows into this valley , and I can never tell whether it is the sound of jubilation or of pain . <p> I did n't realize it , but a piece of the broken figure had hit me hard in the head . All I knew at that moment was that the world seemed oddly wrenched from its usual state . <p> Something as cold as a January night seemed to be dragging me through the sand toward the main shaft of the Pahpocket . I stretched out my arms , grabbing for an anchor point , and I found Nimitseahpah 's heavy , broken base . I saw Phinney , Doyle , and Quince slide past me on their bellies , screaming . It felt exactly as if the ground around the shaft had tilted and risen upward like the sides of a funnel . <p> " Catch hold of me ! " I cried . <p> The rest of it is very difficult to remember clearly . I have only a series of disconnected impressions to guide me . There was a terrible howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys caught my ankle . I had bruises from it later . I suppose it must have been Quince . I could n't see him . I could only feel his white-hot grip and hear him screaming . I remember Phinney catching my elbow , and working his way up from there , so that he , too , held onto the remains of the statue . I had a glimpse of Jacques 's face , slashed with horror , that made me think , poor Jacques . He had n't thought far enough ahead to see his own danger , or he did n't care about it in the moment of his passion . Every child his age has such moments , though few are made to die for them . <p> What I recall most clearly is a brief impression of Nev . He stood miraculously upright , arms spread wide , his neck arched back in a posture for all the world like Nimitseahpah 's . The black power of the mine drew his clothing and his hair toward it , but some other force held him where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Help me ! " I thought at first he was calling to me , or to one of the children , or to God . A moment later , the air became opaque with flying objects - boards , branches , boulders , pieces of metal - and I realized he was speaking to the storm . <p> THERE BEGINS a gap in my memory . I awoke in my own bed . It was morning . The world beyond the window made me think of a china cup , brilliant white , and brilliant blue . It had snowed , but the sky was vivid and clear . The branches of the little plum tree in our yard drooped , the spring blossoms ruined . <p> Jesse told me there had been an accident at the Pahpocket . Jacques and Doyle were missing . The gargoyle was gone . There seemed to have been a cave-in . People were hoping I would know what had happened . <p> I knew in an instant that Jacques and Doyle were gone forever , down the throat of what Nimitseahpah had guarded so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept there . I knew as well that Nev Treleaven had saved my life , and Phinney 's and Quince 's . And that it was true what he 'd said . He was not like anybody . Sooner or later , everyone who knew him feared him . <p> It was a long time before I could speak of it , or even think of it without great pain , and longer still before I could weather a storm without weeping again for all that year 's dead children . <p> A few weeks after Pahpocket , I begged Jesse to take me away or send me home . He said , " Kezzie , mines are all I know . I could take you to Tonopah or Goldfield , but I do n't think it would help much . They 're bigger , sure , at least for now . But every mining town is boom or bust and full of death . If you left and went home , I .... " He stared at the floor , then out the window . I watched the muscles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong line . After a time , he cleared his throat , looked into my face , and said , " Stay with me . I promise I 'll make you happy here . " <p> I thought of mornings in our kitchen , his hand on my waist as he waltzed me across the floor , beaming at the sunrise . I thought of waking in a lonely bed two thousand miles away from him , in a clean and civilized place that never smelled of sagebrush and never contained his smile . And I thought of my schoolroom , and the sixteen children remaining , who might never learn to read or figure sums without their teacher . I kissed him and stayed . <p> Not that it was easy . It was two more long and sorry years before the 1907 bonanza strike at the Double Silver Mine turned things around for Pactolus . Jesse and I never did have children , much as we wanted them . But by and by , I grew to love all the children of Pactolus save one as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , was Nev Treleaven , who fended off love as if it were hailstones . He grew to manhood and married a Paiute no one in Pactolus had ever seen before - a beautiful girl as strange and wild as he . They had four children together , all named after trees , seasons , and other elements of nature . One died young , two moved away , and the other one , River , everyone knows . You can see the little house Nev built for his family still , near the river , across from Moffat 's ranch . It is made of bottles mortared together with the necks all facing out . And when the wind blows through them , it moans like a sad , sad living thing . <p> Listen . You can hear it now . It 's not coyotes ; it 's the wind in Nevlin 's house . Please an old woman , do , and throw another stick or two of wood on that poor fire . It 's cold tonight , inside and out . <p> Sidebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
