<p> LOS ANGELES  --  In God , Hollywood is trusting it will find big profits . <p> Inspired by box-office smashes such as The Passion of the Christ and The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , studios are not only casting an eye to more religious-themed stories , but they 're also marketing movies more aggressively than ever to churchgoers . <p> Producers now find themselves making sales pitches to ministers . Executives are screening films in church community rooms . One studio has created a " faith division " to market to the devout . <p> The strategy has two aims : to use faith-based hits to help staunch a three-year box-office slide and to convert those with little faith in Hollywood fare into permanent moviegoers . <p> No fewer than a dozen films with religious themes are on tap through 2007 . Not all of the movies are overtly spiritual : Next month 's The Da Vinci Code , for instance , is based on a novel that has infuriated Catholics for questioning the origins and motives of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic that has been largely overlooked since Charlton Heston grabbed some tablets and a chariot a half-century ago . <p> Among the high-profile films in the works : <p> * <p> The Da Vinci Code <p> ( opening May 19 ) . Based on Dan Brown 's best seller , the Tom Hanks thriller tells of a murder at the Louvre and possible Vatican involvement . <p> * <p> Nativity <p> ( Dec. 1 ) . Keisha Castle-Hughes ( Whale Rider ) plays the Virgin Mary in this story of her trek with Joseph to Bethlehem for the birth of Jesus . <p> *The Chronicles of Narnia : Prince Caspian ( Dec. 14 , 2007 ) . The Christian parable and sequel to last year 's hit continues the story of siblings who are caught in a battle of good vs. evil in a fantasy kingdom . <p> " Hollywood is finally waking up to the fact that people who go to church also go to the movies , " says Tyler Perry , the director who turned his church plays into the surprise hits Diary of a Mad Black Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what took them so long to see that  --  or how long they 'll keep it up . <p> " But at least we 're getting the chance to prove that there 's an audience for movies with the right message . " <p> A collection plate for studios ? <p> There 's also money . The literary world has been reaping profits for decades with religious fare . The biblical Left Behind novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins , for example , have racked up sales of more than $650 million and spawned four movies . <p> But it was n't until Passion arrived in theaters in February 2004 that major studios saw their own stairway to financial heaven . <p> Before Mel Gibson 's telling of the Crucifixion , " we all knew we had a lot to learn about this market , which was obviously underserved , " says Steve Feldstein of 20th Century Fox 's new division , Fox Faith . <p> The department markets DVDs and feature films to hundreds of pastors nationwide . The studio offers churches trailers , posters and even Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Beyond the Splendor Gates and Hangman 's Curse . <p> As The Passion of the Christ marched to more than $370 million in North America , " it gave us all our MBAs pretty quickly , " Feldstein says . Executives discovered that a thumbs-up from a pastor could go further than from a film critic and that word of mouth spreads pretty quickly in a church , he says . " For many families , church is n't just somewhere you go to pray , " he says . " It 's a social venue . There 's more opportunity for discussion of things beyond just faith . " <p> Like movies . <p> Reuben Cannon discovered the power of the divine at the box office in Houston in 2003 . Cannon , a producer , was attending the annual Woman , Thou Art Loosed conference , a religious convention based on Bishop T.D . Jakes ' self-help novel of the same name . <p> Cannon was astounded to see the conference draw 60,000 people , primarily women , each day of the three-day convention . " Rock stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I thought if we could bring in that kind of audience into a theater , we 'd have a hit . " <p> He was right . Cannon produced the film adaptation of Loosed in 2004 for less than $1 million . It brought in nearly $7 million and paved the way for Cannon to produce two No. 1 films , last year 's Diary of a Mad Black Woman , which raked in $50.6 million , and this year 's Reunion , which earned $63.1million , more than 10 times its budget . <p> He built momentum for the films much the way Gibson did for Passion and Disney executives did for Narnia : with private screenings for church members and private sales pitches to ministers . <p> " With so much competition , you ca n't just put your movie out there with a few ads , " says Chuck Viane , head of distribution for Disney . " You have to build word of mouth . And it can build quickly " in the religious community . <p> When the church is united behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cannon says . " That 's why people are paying a lot more attention to the mega-pastors . When you 've got thousands of people who listen to you every week , when you can rent out entire theaters , you 've got a powerful voice . " <p> Indeed , studios are finding that ministers who preach to flocks of 5,000 or more a week can be as powerful a marketing tool as a slick advertising campaign . <p> The clergy , says Steve Rothenberg , distribution chief for Lionsgate Films , are one of the few links " to a group that 's been largely ignored when it comes to movies . " <p> " I 'm not sure why , but Hollywood did n't consider ( churchgoers ) a very viable audience , " says Rothenberg , whose studio distributed Diary and Reunion . " But I think that 's changing , especially with the success of the movies recently . " <p> ' The fifth quadrant ' <p> Industry executives are revising advertising campaigns to recognize audiences of faith . Traditionally , studios market movies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moviegoers younger than 25 , and those 25 and older . The churchgoing community has become the " fifth quadrant . " <p> Just how big that demographic is , however , is anyone 's guess . According to a Gallup survey in December , about 57% of Americans consider religion " very important " in their everyday lives . <p> Hollywood has found religion before . Through the 1950s , studios churned out hits ( 1953 's The Robe , 1956 's The Ten Commandments , 1959 's Ben-Hur ) . But by the mid- ' 60s , religious epics gave way to musicals , leaving religious fare largely to niche producers . <p> The industry is just now rediscovering the scope of the faith-based audience , says Joel Silver , producer of The Reaping , starring Hilary Swank as a Christian missionary who loses her faith after a tragedy . It 's due Aug. 11 . " We really have n't marketed to that group , " Silver says . " I 'm not sure why . We market to urban audiences . " <p> Joe Bubar , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welcomes being Hollywood 's hot new demographic . His church rented five theaters during the opening week of Narnia and urged its 5,500 members to turn out in force . <p> He says churches welcome faith-based films as much as Hollywood welcomes faith-based money . " We 're looking for things that help us deliver our message , " he says . " And , particularly with younger people , movies do that . We welcome movies with a positive message . " <p> Do n't call it pandering <p> Some filmmakers , in turn , are responding with biblically based stories such as Passion or Nativity and other films that take an earnest look at religion . <p> " There 's another way to look at faith in movies , " says James Marsh , director of The King , a William Hurt drama about a minister father who reunites with his troubled son that 's due May 19 . " Instead of mocking religious people or portraying them as hypocrites , you 're seeing a more straight-up examination of how hard it is to be righteous . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dramatic storylines . " <p> J.J. Abrams , who routinely examines faith in his television series Lost , does n't see the move toward religious-based entertainment as pandering . <p> " We 're seeing more religion in mass entertainment because it has become so topical , " says Abrams , whose Mission : Impossible III is due May 5 . " Given all the conflict in the world based on religion , I think there 's a real hunger for that kind of dialogue . " <p> Perhaps , but selling movies to faith-based audiences also means hearing from them when they 're not happy with your film . Already , Sony Pictures is bracing for possible protests over Da Vinci . <p> The studio has set up a website , **26;1350;TOOLONG , that essentially distances Sony from the film 's message by presenting counterarguments to the drama . The site features essays by religious scholars about the historical beginnings of Christianity and invites readers to chime in . <p> " We view The Da Vinci Code as a work of speculative fiction , and at its heart , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Jim Kennedy , a senior vice president at Sony . " We encourage everyone to visit sites like ours and join in a dialogue that can shed light on topics explored in The Da Vinci Code . " <p> For Da Vinci director Ron Howard , the approach has been a little simpler in dealing with letters from protesters . He does n't open them . <p> " I 'm not a caterer , " Howard says . " I just have to stay with my creative convictions . At some point , you have to just get past the special-interest groups and do what you 're there to do , which is make a movie .
