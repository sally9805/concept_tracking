A few years ago a psychopath burned down my house . The night it happened , I was out to dinner with the woman whod designed the house and lived in it with me . We were driving up Beverly Glen when the sirens cut through the darkness , ululating , like coyote death wails . The noise died quickly , indicating a nearby disaster , but there was no reason to assume the worst . Unless youre the worst kind of fatalist , you think : Something lousy happened to some poor devil . That night , I learned different . Since then , the Klaxon of an ambulance or a fire truck in my neighborhood sets off something inside mea crimp of shoulder , a catch of breath , an arrhythmic flutter of the plum-colored thing in my chest . Pavlov was right . Im trained as a clinical psychologist , could do something about it but have chosen not to . Sometimes anxiety makes me feel alive . When the sirens shrieked , Milo and I were having dinner at an Italian place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool June night . The restaurant closes at eleven , but we were the last patrons , and the waiter was looking tired . The woman I was now seeing was teaching a night course in abnormal psychology at the U. , and Milos partner , Rick Silverman , was busy at the Cedars-Sinai ER trying to salvage the five most seriously injured victims of a ten-car pileup on the Santa Monica Freeway . Milo had just closed the file on a **27;172;TOOLONG homicide at a liquor store on Pico Boulevard . The solve had taken more persistence than brainwork . He was in a position to pick his cases , and no new ones had crossed his desk . Id finally finished testifying at the seemingly endless child-custody hearings waged by a famous director and his famous actress wife . Id begun the consult with some optimism . The director had once been an actor , and both he and his ex knew how to perform . Now , three years later , two kids whod started out in pretty good shape were basket cases living in France . Milo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad , orrechiati stuffed with spinach , veal pounded to paper . Neither of us felt like talking . A bottle of decent white wine smoothed the silence . Both of us were strangely content ; life wasnt fair , but wed done our jobs well . When sirens came , I kept my eyes on my plate . Milo stopped eating . The napkin hed tucked in his shirt collar was spotted with spinach and olive oil . Do nt worry , he said . Not a fire . Whos worrying ? He pushed hair off his forehead , picked up his fork and knife , speared , chewed , swallowed . I said , How can you tell ? That its not a big-red ? Trust me , Alex . Its a black-and-white . I know the frequency . A second cruiser wailed by . Then a third . He pulled his tiny blue cell phone out of his pocket and punched a button . A preset number rang . I raised my eyebrows . Just curious , he said . His connection went through , and he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just went out in the vicinity of upper Beverly Glen ? Yeah , near Mulholland . He waited , green eyes dimmed to near brown in the miserly light of the restaurant . Under the spotted napkin was a baby blue polo shirt that really did nt work well with his pallid complexion . His acne pits were flagrant , his jowls gravid as freshly filled wineskins . Long white sideburns frizzed his big face , a pair of skunkish stripes that seemed to sprout artificially from his black hair . He s a gay policeman and my best friend . That so , he said . Any detective assigned , yet ? Okay , listen , I happen to be right near there , can make it over in tenno make that fifteenmake it twenty minutes . Yeah , yeah , sure . He snapped the little phone shut . Double homicide , two bodies in a car . Being this close , I figured I should have a look . The crime scenes still being secured , and the techs havent gotten there , so we can still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check , and he offered to drive me home , but neither of us took that seriously . In that case , he said , well take the Seville . I drove quickly . The crime scene was on the west side of the intersection between the Glen and Mulholland , up a skinny , decomposed , granite road marked private that climbed through sycamore-crowned hillside . A police cruiser was stationed at the mouth of the road . Staked to a tree several feet up was a for sale sign bearing the logo of a Westside Realtor . Milo flashed the badge to the uniform in the car , and we drove through . At the top of the road was a house behind high , night-blackened hedges . Two more black-and-whites kept us ten yards back . We parked and continued on foot . The sky was purplish , the air still bitter with the smolder of two early-summer brush fires , one up near Camarillo , the other past Tujunga . Both had just been vanquished . One had been set by a fireman . Behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left open . The bodies slumped in a red Mustang convertible parked on a semicircular flagstone driveway . The house behind the drive was a vacant mansion , a big neo-Spanish thing that was probably cheerful peach in the daylight . At this hour , it was putty gray . The driveway bordered a half acre of front yard , shaded by more sycamoresgiant ones . The house looked newish and was ruined by too many weird-shaped windows , but someone had been smart enough to spare the trees . The top was down on the little red car . I stood back and watched as Milo approached , careful to stay behind the tape . He did nothing but stare . Moments later , a pair of crime-scene techs walked onto the property lugging cases on a dolly . They talked to him briefly , then slipped under the tape . He walked back to the Seville . Looks like gunshot wounds to both heads , a guy and a girl , young . He s in the drivers seat , shes next to him . His flys open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed in the backseat along with her bra . Under the shirt she wore black leggings . Theyre rolled down to her ankles , and her legs are spread . Lovers lane thing ? I said . Empty house , he said . Good neighborhood . Probably a nice view from the backyard . Seize the night and all that ? Sure . If they knew about the house , they could be locals . He looked clean-cut , well dressed . Yeah , Id say local is also a decent bet . I wonder why the gate was left open . Or maybe it wasnt , and one of them has some connection to the house and a gate-clicker . For all we know , one of their families built the place . Crime Scene will do their thing , hopefully theyll find IDs in the pockets . The cars plates are being run right now . I said , Any gun in sight ? A murder-suicide thing ? Not likely . He rubbed his face . His hand lingered at his mouth , tugged down his lower lip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two head-shots plus , Alex . Someone jammed what looks to be a short spear or a crossbow bolt into the girls torso . Here . He touched a spot under his breastbone . From what I could see the damn thing went clear through her and is lodged in the seat . The impact jolted her body , shes lying funny . A spear . She was skewered , Alex . A bullet to the brain wasnt enough . Overkill , I said . A message . Were they actually making love or were they positioned sexually ? He flashed a frightening smile . Now were veering into your territory . From the Hardcover edition .
