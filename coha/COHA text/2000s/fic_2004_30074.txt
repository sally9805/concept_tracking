Chapter One LIZARDS Sometimes it seems unfair that events so old can reach forward through the years , sinking claws into one 's life and twisting all that follows it . Yet perhaps that is the ultimate justice : we are the sum of all we have done added to the sum of all that has been done to us . There is no escaping that , not for any of us . So it was that everything that the Fool had ever said to me and all the things he 'd left unsaid combined . And the sum was that I betrayed him . Yet I believed that I acted in his best interests , and mine . He had foretold that if we went to Aslevjal Island , he would die and Death might make another snap of his jaws at me . He promised to do all in his power to see that I survived , for his grand scheme to change the future required it . But with my latest brush with death still fresh in my memory , I found his promises more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once we were on the island , I would have to choose between our friendship and my loyalty to Prince Dutiful . Perhaps I could have faced one of those things and stood strong before it , but I doubt it . Any one of those things was enough to unman me , and facing the sum of them was simply beyond my strength . So I went to Chade . I told him what the Fool had said . And my old mentor arranged that when we sailed for the Out Islands , the Fool would not go with us . Spring had come to Buckkeep Castle . The grim black stone edifice still crouched suspiciously on the steep cliffs above Buckkeep Town , but on the rolling hills behind the keep , new green grass was pushing optimistically up through the standing brown straw of last year 's growth . The bare-limbed forests were hazed with tiny green leaves unfurling on every tree branch . The wintry mounds of dead kelp on the black beaches at the foot of the cliffs had been swept away by the tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges in the forested hills and along the beaches where seabirds battled for choice nesting nooks in the cliffs . Spring had even invaded the dim halls and high-ceilinged chambers of the keep , for blossoming branches and early-blooming flowers graced every alcove and framed the entries of the gathering rooms . The warmer winds seemed to sweep my gloom away . None of my problems and concerns had vanished , but spring can dismiss a multitude of worries . My physical state had improved ; I felt more youthful than I had in my twenties . Not only was I building flesh and muscle again , but I suddenly possessed the body that a fit man of my years should have . The harsh healing I had undergone at the inexperienced hands of the coterie had inadvertently undone old damage as well . Abuse I had suffered at Galen 's hands in the course of his teaching me the Skill , injuries I had taken as a warrior , and the deep scars from my torture in Regal 's dungeons had been erased . My headaches had nearly ceased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did not ache in the chill of early morning . I lived now in the body of a strong and healthy animal . Few things are so exhilarating as good health on a clear spring morning . I stood on the top of a tower and looked out over the wrinkling sea . Behind me , tubs of earth , freshly manured , held small fruit trees arrayed in blossoms of white and pale pink . Smaller pots held vines with swelling leaf buds . The long green leaves of bulb flowers thrust up like scouts sent to test the air . In some pots , only bare brown stalks showed , but the promise was there , each plant awaiting the return of warmer days . Interspersed with the pots were artfully arranged statuary and beckoning benches . Shielded candles awaited mellow summer nights to send their glow into the darkness . Queen Kettricken had restored the Queen 's Garden to its former glory . This high retreat was her private territory . Its present simplicity reflected her Mountain roots , but its existence was a much older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter path , and then forced myself to stand still . The boy was not late . I was early . That the minutes dragged was not his fault . Anticipation warred with reluctance as I awaited my first private meeting with Swift , Burrich 's son . My queen had given me responsibility for Swift 's instruction in both letters and weaponry . I dreaded the task . Not only was the boy Witted , but he was undeniably headstrong . Those two things , coupled with his intelligence , could carry him into trouble . The Queen had decreed that the Witted must be treated with respect , but many still believed that the best cure for Beast Magic was a noose , a knife , and a fire . I understood the Queen 's motive in entrusting Swift to me . His father , Burrich , had turned him out of his home when the boy would not give up the Wit . Yet the same Burrich had devoted years to raising me when I was a lad and abandoned by my royal father as a bastard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now do the same for Burrich 's son , even if I could never let the boy know that I had once been FitzChivalry and his father 's ward . So it was that I awaited Swift , a skinny lad of ten summers , as nervously as if I faced the boy 's father . I took a deep breath of the cool morning air . The scent of the fruit tree blossoms balmed it . I reminded myself that my task would not last long . Very soon , I would accompany the Prince on his quest to Aslevjal in the Out Islands . Surely I could endure being the lad 's instructor until then . The Wit Magic makes one aware of other life , and so I turned even before Swift pushed open the heavy door . He shut it quietly behind him . Despite his long climb up the steep stone stairs , he was not breathing hard . I remained partially concealed by screening blossoms and studied him . He was dressed in Buckkeep blue , in simple garments befitting a page . Chade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was thin , in the way of active boys of that age , but the knobs of shoulders under his jerkin promised his father 's brawn . I doubted he would be tall , but he would be wide enough to make up for it . Swift had his father 's black eyes and dark curling hair , but there was something of Molly in the line of his jaw and the set of his eyes . Molly , my lost love and Burrich 's wife . I took a long , deep breath . This might be more difficult than I had imagined . I saw him become aware of me . I stood still , letting his eyes seek me out . For a time we both stood , unspeaking . Then he threaded his way through the meandering paths until he stood before me . His bow was too carefully practiced to be graceful . " My lord , I am Swift Witted . I was told to report to you , and so I present myself . " I could see he had made an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Beast Magic in how he named himself seemed almost a rude challenge , as if he tested whether the Queen 's protection of the Witted would hold here , alone with me . He met my gaze in a forthright way that most nobles would have found presumptuous . Then again , I reminded myself , I was not a noble . I told him so . " I am not ' my lord ' to anyone , lad . I 'm Tom Badgerlock , a man-at-arms in the Queen 's Guard . You may call me Master Badgerlock , and I shall call you Swift . Is that agreed ? " He blinked twice and then nodded . Abruptly , he recalled that that was not correct . " It is , sir . Master Badgerlock . " " Very well . Swift , do you know why you were sent to me ? " He bit his upper lip twice , swift successive nibbles , then took a deep breath and spoke , eyes lowered . " I suppose I 've displeased someone . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what I did , or to whom . " Almost defiantly , he added , " I can not help what I am . If it is because I am Witted , well , then , it is n't fair . Our queen has said that my magic should not make any difference in how I am treated . " My breath caught in my throat . His father looked at me from those dark eyes . The uncompromising honesty and the determination to speak the truth was all Burrich 's . And yet , in his intemperate haste , I heard Molly 's quick temper . For a moment , I was at a loss for words . The boy interpreted my silence as displeasure and lowered his eyes . But the set of his shoulders was still square ; he did not know of any fault he had committed , and he would not show any repentance until he did . " You did not displease anyone , Swift . And you will find that to some at Buckkeep , your Wit matters not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other children . Rather , this change is for your benefit . Your knowledge of letters surpasses the other children of your age . We did not wish to thrust you into a group of youths much older than you . It was also decided that you could benefit from instruction in the use of a battle-axe . That , I believe , is why I was chosen to mentor you . " His head jerked and he looked up at me in confusion and dismay . " A battle-axe ? " I nodded , both to him and to myself . Chade was up to his old tricks again . Plainly the boy had not been asked if he had any interest in learning to wield such a weapon . I put a smile on my face . " Certainly a battle-axe . Buckkeep 's men-at-arms recall that your father fought excellently with the axe . As you inherit his build as well as his looks , it seems natural that his weapon of choice should be yours . " " I 'm nothing like my father . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but because the boy had never looked more like Burrich than he did at that moment . It felt odd to look down at someone giving me his black scowl . But such an attitude was not appropriate to a boy of his years , so I coldly said , " You 're like enough , in the Queen 's and Councilor Chade 's opinions . Do you dispute what they have decided for you ? " It all hovered in the balance . I saw the instant when he made his decision , and almost read the workings of his mind . He could refuse . Then he might be seen as ungrateful and sent back home to his father . Better to bow his head to a distasteful task and stay . And so he said , voice lowered , " No , sir . I accept what they have decided . " " That 's good , " I said with false heartiness . But before I could continue , he informed me , " But I have a skill with a weapon already . The bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I did not think it would be of interest to anyone . But if I 'm to train as a fighter as well as a page , I already have a weapon of choice . " Interesting . I regarded him in silence for a moment . I 'd seen enough of Burrich in him to suspect he would not idly boast of a skill he did n't possess . " Very well , then . You may show me your skills with a bow . But this time is set aside for other lessons . To that end , we 've been given permission to use scrolls from the Buckkeep library . That 's quite an honor for both of us . " I waited for a response . He bobbed a nod , and then recalling his manners , " Yes , sir . " " Good . Then meet me here tomorrow . We 'll have an hour of scrolls and writing , and then we 'll go down to the weapons court . " Again I awaited his reply . " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a good horseman , sir . I 'm a bit rusty now . My father refused to let me be around his horses for the last year . But I 'm a good horseman , as well . " " That 's good to know , Swift . " I knew what he had hoped . I watched his face , and saw the light in it dim at my neutral response . I had reacted almost reflexively . A boy of his age should n't be considering bonding with an animal . Yet as he lowered his head in disappointment , I felt my old loneliness echo down the years . So too had Burrich done all he could to protect me from bonding with a beast . Knowing the wisdom of it now did n't still the memory of my thrumming isolation . I cleared my throat and tried to keep my voice smoothly assured when I spoke . " Very well , then , Swift . Report to me here tomorrow . Oh , and wear your old clothes tomorrow . We 'll be getting dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is it , lad ? " " I ... sir , I ca n't . I , that is , I do n't have my old clothes anymore . Only the two sets the Queen gave me . " " What happened to them ? " " I ... I burned them , sir . " He suddenly sounded defiant . He met my eyes , jaw jutting . I thought of asking him why . I did n't need to . It was obvious from his stance . He had made a show for himself of destroying all things that bound him to his past . I wondered if I should make him admit that aloud , then decided that nothing would be gained by it . Surely such a waste of useful garments was something that should shame him . I wondered how bitterly his differences with his father had run . Suddenly the day seemed a little less brightly blue . I shrugged , dismissing the matter . " Wear what you have , then , " I said abruptly , and hoped I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I realized that I had n't dismissed him . " You may go now , Swift . I will see you tomorrow . " " Yes , sir . Thank you , Master Badgerlock . " He bowed , jerkily correct , and then hesitated again . " Sir ? May I ask you a last question ? " " Certainly . " He looked all around us , almost suspiciously . " Why do we meet up here ? " " It 's quiet . It 's pleasant . When I was your age , I hated to be kept indoors on a spring day . " That brought a hesitant smile to his face . " So do I , sir . Nor do I like to be kept so isolated from animals . That is my magic calling me , I suppose . " I wished he had let it rest . " Perhaps it is . And perhaps you should think well before you answer it . " This time I intended that he hear the rebuke in my voice . He flinched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic was not to make a difference to anyone . That no one can treat me poorly because of it . " ( Continues ... )
