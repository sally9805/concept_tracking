Preface Adi Ignatius // It was an exhilarating moment for China and the world . In late 1987 , at the end of a spirited Communist Party Congress that seemed to propel China on a more progressive course , a new team of leaders emerged , led by a preternaturally tranquil man named Zhao Ziyang. // Zhao was n't an unknown : after an impressive career in the provinces guiding the first , baby steps of China 's recovery from Mao Zedong 's lethally unsuccessful economic experiments , Zhao had been summoned to Beijing in 1980 and was soon named Premier , responsible for the economy . // Yet now he was being elevated to the most senior position in China 's leadership : General Secretary of the Party . Since he was only sixty-eight years old  --  a mere child among China 's leaders  --  he had to deal with an older generation of Party veterans who lacked official titles but nonetheless wielded ultimate authority . But the supreme leader of those octogenarians , Deng Xiaoping , had given Zhao the keys to the republic . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any previous Chinese leader . When the new inner core , the Standing Committee of the Politburo , appeared at the end of that Congress in 1987 for an unprecedented face-to-face with the international press corps at the Great Hall of the People , Zhao beamed with a relaxed confidence . He seemed to signal that China was ready to join the world , that it had begun a process of transforming not just its economy but also its tightfisted politics . // For the first time in memory , the entire Standing Committee appeared in Western attire , their Mao suits stashed away for this photo op aimed at telling the developed West that China was comfortable on stage . When a reporter commented on Zhao 's impressive double-breasted pinstripe suit , Zhao , with a big grin , playfully pulled open the jacket to show off a lapel that indicated : made in China . A new era seemed to be at hand . // Over the next two years , however , things would spin out of control , for China and for Zhao . Missteps on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens and opened the door for China 's more cautious leaders to seize authority and reimpose central controls . // And then , in April 1989 , the Tiananmen protests erupted . By the time they were suppressed , less than two months later , Zhao was out of power and under house arrest in his home on a quiet alley in Beijing . China 's most promising change agent had been disgraced , along with the policies he stood for . // Zhao spent the last sixteen years of his life , up until his death in 2005 , in seclusion . An occasional detail about his life would slip out : reports of a golf excursion , a photo of his aging visage , a leaked letter to China 's leaders . But China scholars often lamented that Zhao never had his final say , that he did n't leave his take on what really happened behind the scenes during the tumultuous years that he was in Beijing and , in particular , in 1989 during the Tiananmen protests , when he stood up to China 's conservative forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce such a memoir , in complete secrecy . This book is the first time it is being made public . // Zhao , it turns out , methodically recorded his thoughts and recollections on some of modern China 's most critical moments . He talked of the Tiananmen crackdown , of his clashes behind the scenes with his powerful rivals , of the often petty bickering that lay behind policy making , of how China had to evolve politically to achieve long-term stability . // Somehow , under the nose of his captors , Zhao found a way to record about thirty tapes , each about sixty minutes long . Judging from their contents , they were made around the year 2000 . Members of his family say they knew nothing about the project . Zhao produced these audio journals mostly by recording over some low-quality cassette tapes that were lying around the house : kids ' music and Peking Opera . He indicated their order by numbering them with faint pencil markings . There were no titles or other notes . The first few recordings , covering Tiananmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Zhao had backstabbed his predecessor , Hu Yaobang , when Hu had been forced out of power in 1987  --  seem to have been made in discussion with friends . Their voices are heard on the tapes but have been edited out to protect them and their families ' security . // When Zhao finished the recordings after about two years , he found a way to pass tapes to several trusted friends . Each was given only a portion of the total recordings , clearly an attempt to hedge the risk that the tapes might be lost or confiscated . When Zhao died in 2005 , some of the people who knew of the recordings launched a complex , clandestine effort to gather the materials in one place and then transcribe them for publication . Later , another set of the tapes , perhaps the originals , was found , hidden in plain view among the grandchildren 's toys in Zhao 's study . The audio recordings themselves have been returned to Zhao 's family , who will decide how they should be preserved . Clips of the recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book . // Prisoner of the State is a nearly complete presentation of Zhao 's recorded journal . The book does not follow Zhao 's precise sequence . Some chunks were rearranged and others trimmed to eliminate repetition and for greater readability . For instance , we open with sections that deal with the Tiananmen protests and crackdown of 1989 and with Zhao 's many years under house arrest . We begin each chapter with brief editors ' notes , in italics , to help set the stage for readers who are n't familiar with what was happening in China at the time . We also have inserted material throughout the book in brackets and footnotes to provide added clarity . Wherever these appear , these are our words , not Zhao's. // Although Zhao gave no instructions as to how or when the materials might be published or otherwise used , he clearly wanted his story to survive . Here 's what he says at the start of Part 1 , which covers the events leading up to the Tiananmen Massacre of June 4 , 1989 : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth incident because I was worried that I might start forgetting some of the specifics . I hoped that it might serve as a kind of historical record . " // What is the significance of this journal ? Above all , it is the first time that a leader of Zhao 's stature in China has spoken frankly about life at the top . He provides an intimate look at one of the world 's most opaque regimes . We learn about the triumphs and failures , the boasts and insecurities , of the man who tried to bring liberal change to China , and who made every effort to stop the Tiananmen Massacre . This is Zhao 's version of history , and he perhaps was making his arguments for a future generation of leaders who may revisit his case and decide whether he should be rehabilitated in the memory of the Party , and of the nation . // The power structure that Zhao describes is chaotic , often bumbling . Competing factions rush to win over paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , whose nods of assent or rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this narrative , Deng is a conflicted figure who urges Zhao to move quickly with economic reforms but consistently fights back against anything that seems to challenge the Party 's supremacy . He is at times portrayed not as the authority , but as a puppet , subject to manipulation by Zhao or his rivals , depending on who presents his case first . Zhao reflects on comments he made to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that upset Deng . His assumption , based on years in the inner circle , is that Deng could not have had such a reaction simply on his own : " I have yet to learn who it was or how that person managed to provoke Deng . " // The China that Zhao portrays is not some long-lost dynasty . It is today 's China , where the nation 's leaders accept economic freedom but continue to intimidate and arrest anyone who tries to speak openly about political change . Although the central figures of Zhao 's narrative have mostly passed from the scene , the system itself and its habits have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred Chinese activists , marking the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , jointly signed Charter 08 , a document that called on the Party to reform its political system and allow freedom of expression and an independent judiciary . Beijing responded as it always has : by interrogating many of the signatories and arresting some , including prominent dissident Liu Xiaobo. // China is still a nation where the Party 's obsession with self-perpetuation drives its public behavior , and where patriotic voices that do n't narrowly conform are silenced . That has consequences far beyond the political sphere . In 2003 , when the deadly SARs virus began to spread in China , officials initially resorted to form by trying to control the news and cover up the extent of the problem . That lack of candor may have exposed many thousands more to possible infection . // This journal is n't comprehensive . It does n't deal with Zhao 's long and productive career , only the tumultuous three years before he fell from power . Yet his impressive achievements and the reputation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power traces to his success running economic policy in the provinces . Though born in Henan Province , he built his career in Guangdong , where he became Party chief in 1965 at the remarkably tender age of forty-six . Like countless other officials , he was purged during the Cultural Revolution ; he was assigned the relatively menial task of being a fitter at the Xiangzhong Mechanics Factory in Hunan Province . Zhao Wujun , the youngest of his four sons ( there is also one daughter ) , worked with him . The family lived in a small apartment nearby with a suitcase in the middle of the living room that served as the dinner table . // Zhao 's return from exile shows the high regard Beijing 's leaders had for him . As Zhao once described it to friends , in April 1971 the Zhao family was suddenly roused in the middle of the night by a banging at the door . Without explanation , the factory 's Party chief informed Zhao that he was to go at once to Changsha , the provincial capital . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was quickly readied to take him . // Zhao was driven to Changsha 's airport , where a plane had been prepared to fly him to Beijing . Still unaware of what was happening , he boarded the plane ; it landed in Beijing , and he was driven to the well-appointed Beijing Hotel . Zhao said he did n't sleep all night ; after his years in the political wilderness , the mattress was too soft . // In the morning , he was taken for a meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai at the Great Hall of the People . When they met , Zhao began a speech he had been preparing all night : " I have been rethinking the Cultural Revolution during these years as a laborer  --  " Zhou cut him off and told him , " You 've been called to Beijing because the Central Committee has decided to name you as a deputy Party chief of Inner Mongolia . " // Zhao later learned that Chairman Mao himself had been responsible for his return from political exile . Mao one day had suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was told that Zhao had been purged and sent to the countryside as a laborer , Mao expressed his displeasure with the excesses of the purification effort he had launched with the Cultural Revolution : " Purging every single person ? That 's not what I want ... " With that , Zhao Ziyang was rehabilitated . // Zhao held top jobs in several provinces and won widespread praise for finding solutions to the economic paralysis left over from Mao 's collectivization . He became the Party leader in Sichuan Province in 1975 and launched ambitious changes in the countryside that increased agricultural output and farmers ' wealth . His success prompted locals to say " yao chi liang , zhao Ziyang , " a wordplay on his name that translates roughly as " If you want to eat , look for Ziyang. " // Unlike many other high-ranking officials , Zhao had a reputation for pragmatism , for taking care of business . He could n't stand having people do things for him . Before he was purged for the final time in 1989 , there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's service bureau sent over a doctor to give him massages to help him rest . After a few visits , Zhao had them stopped . Asked why , he said , " The first thing this doctor did each time he came was to kneel down on the floor and take off my shoes . I could n't stand it . " Zhao never seemed to warm to the isolation of Zhongnanhai , the Party 's fortified compound in the center of Beijing . When he 'd meet people from outside China 's inner circle , he 'd excitedly ask , " What 's the latest news out there ? " // But if Zhao was a rule breaker , he was also a man of discipline . Whereas his predecessor as Party chief , Hu Yaobang , was indiscreet ( an incautious interview with a Hong Kong journalist may ultimately have cost him his job ) , Zhao was circumspect and mindful of the potential fallout from every step he took . That rigor extended to his personal life as well . For years when he worked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1980 when he was about to become Premier , he changed his mind . " Okay , it 's time , " he told friends . He never smoked again . ( He did continue to drink , however , and had a reputation for being able to handle large quantities ; a friend says Zhao had no trouble tossing back six mao-tais over a dinner. ) // His years in the provinces were surely his happiest . In Beijing , Deng charged him with leading reforms  --  first in the economy , and later in politics . But China could n't easily adapt to dramatic change , and when things got too shaky , Deng opted for stability . He sacrificed his two most liberal lieutenants : first Hu , then Zhao . Dreams of a broad political awakening in China were put on hold . // Zhao 's account of his final years is dignified , yet sad . Under house arrest , he could do little but obsess over events , rewinding the clock to pore over the technicalities of the Party 's official case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was handled gently , at least compared with earlier , violent purges of communist officials . He was n't put in jail , and the Party eventually lost interest in trying to tear him down . But his captors succeeded in keeping him out of view and making him irrelevant , throwing up enough obstacles to deter all but the most determined visitors . As Zhao says in this journal , " The entrance to my home is a cold , desolate place . " // Scholars will no doubt wish to compare Zhao 's memoir with other accounts of that era . For one thing , he contradicts the widely held belief that the decision in 1989 to call in the military to crack down on student demonstrators was put to a formal vote of the Politburo Standing Committee . Zhao attests otherwise : there was no vote . For Zhao it 's a critical detail , since a proper vote could have lent the decision an air of procedural legitimacy . Zhao explains his own defiance in the clearest of terms : " I refused to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . " // Just after the decision was made to call in the army  --  and aware that his own political career was probably finished  --  Zhao made a remarkable visit to the seething Tiananmen Square to speak with the student protesters . ( Hearing that Zhao was making the trip , his rival , Premier Li Peng , tagged along . Zhao says Li was " terrified " and quickly fled the scene . ) Accompanied in the end by director of the General Office Wen Jiabao , who would later become China 's Premier , a teary Zhao spoke to students through a bullhorn . " We have come too late , " he said , urging students to leave the square to avoid a violent outcome . They did n't heed his words . Around two weeks later , the tanks were unleashed , and hundreds of demonstrators were killed . // Though he was the main voice at the top articulating a gentle response to the protests , Zhao is largely forgotten today . For three years after Tiananmen , China stagnated under the repressive shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own legacy , made a celebrated trip to China 's vibrant southern region and sounded a call to free up economic policy and let people get rich . The result is a China with a booming economy and a repressive government . If Zhao had survived politically  --  that is , if the hard line had n't prevailed on Tiananmen  --  he might have been able to steer China 's political system toward more openness and tolerance . His ultimate aim was a strong economy , but he had become convinced that this goal was inextricably linked to the development of democracy . // Zhao 's call to begin lifting the Party 's control over China 's life  --  to let a little freedom into the public square  --  is remarkable coming from a man who had once dominated that square . Although Zhao now speaks from the grave , his voice has the moral power to make China sit up and listen.Preface copyright ? 2009 by Adi Ignatius //                    @
