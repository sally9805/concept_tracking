ONE FAMILY 'S SIGNAL THAT AUTUMN HAS ARRIVED . BY FAITH ANDREWS BEDFORD // that fresh cider has always heralded the change of seasons for me is no surprise , for my family 's annual trip to the farmers ' market for apples and cider was my signal when I was a kid that fall was finally in full swing-and that Halloween was not far behind . When our own children were small , our little cottage stood beside an abandoned apple orchard nestled at the foot of a small mountain . The trees had been neglected for years , but their gnarled branches still produced fruit-small and misshapen , perhaps , but just fine for pies and applesauce . When my daughter Eleanor became a Brownie Girl Scout , I volunteered to help . At my first leaders ' meeting , I sat quietly listening to the other mothers plan the year 's activities . " And of course the last week in October will be our annual cider making , " one said . " We just have to find the apples . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide with delight . " Where ? " " Up at Sly Creek , " Jan , my new coleader , said , smiling . " Henry Williams has turned the old mill into a cider press . The first pressing starts next week . " At supper , I told my family that the other leaders were thrilled to learn that we lived next to an orchard . I 'd already called the owner and asked if we could gather the windfalls . " Fine with me , " he 'd replied . " I never use ' em . " When I 'd promised to bring him some cider , he 'd snorted , " Probably be awful tart . " THE BROWNIES BEGAN SAVING JUGS . SOON THE leaders ' houses looked like recycling centers ; piles of plastic milk bottles filled every corner . When harvest day arrived , we all gathered at our house and each girl was given a paper sack and instructions to fill it with as many apples as she could find . With an explosion of excitement , the girls scattered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apples that had fallen beneath each tree . But others had their own special method of gathering . Susan , for instance , discarded any apple that was not round and red . But when she noticed that her bag was not nearly as full as those of her friends , she began to adjust her standards of perfection . My daughter Eleanor screwed up her face with disgust if she picked up an apple that was rotten or-heaven forbid ! - contained a worm . Beth , the troop adventurer , climbed to the very tops of the trees seeking the highest fruit , completely ignoring the apples lying in great profusion on the ground . In the tall , golden grass , some of the smaller girls almost completely disappeared . High in the catbird seat of my backpack , my youngest child , Sarah , surveyed the lively scene with delight and reached out for the lumpy , red apples that dangled at eye level . I backed Sarah up to one low-hanging branch and let her grab a prize . She munched on it contentedly , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Exhausted but happy , the Brownies carefully lodged their bulging bags in the cars and we made plans to rendezvous at the cider mill the next day . At supper that evening , Eleanor chattered happily about the apple hunt , then she made a face . " But some of the apples had yucky worms ! " Drew , ever the helpful big brother , said , " You probably ate a worm and did n't even notice . " I shot him " The Look , " but not before he had elicited the desired squeal from his sister . CIDER-MAKING DAY DAWNED BRIGHT and cool . As we drove up the valley to the mill , other families joined us , their cars full of laughing children , bags of apples , and stacks of sterilized milk jugs . We looked like a station wagon train . Henry Williams helped us unload our harvest into a big tub , where the apples tumbled about beneath a spray of water . Then the apples rolled down a chute into a big grinder that spit them out , finely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fascination as Henry leveled the chunked apples with a broad wooden rake and carefully folded the burlap flaps over the apples . His son helped him pile the racks one on top of another until they had a tower eight layers high . It looked like a giant apple-and-burlap sandwich . Then they slid the stack into place beneath the press . " Is everybody ready to make cider ? " Henry called out with a grin . The girls gave a loud cheer : " Yes ! " By pulling a lever , Henry opened the sluice . The old mill began to shudder as water shot over the great wheel and the wheel began to turn . The cogs engaged and the screw slowly lowered the press onto the apple racks . The children held their breath . After a minute or two , golden liquid began to ooze from the edges of the bulging burlap . " Oooooh , " the Brownies sighed in unison . Soon the trickle of cider began to gush from the stack in a thick stream . The little girls raced over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jugs . They quickly formed an impromptu bucket brigade . I stood beside Henry and peppered him with questions . What kind of apples did he think we had ? Should we have been more careful about winnowing out bad apples or those that were n't ripe ? And what about the worms ? Handing me a paper cup filled nearly to the brim with our very own cider , Henry replied simply , " Takes all kinds to make a good batch . " Autumn sunlight streamed through the leaves of the oaks , filling the mill with an amber glow . As I sipped the tangy cider , I gazed at the Brownies as they filled up the jugs . Some squealed with excitement as cider spilled on their hands , some carefully screwed on tops , others quietly organized filled jugs into neat rows . " Yes , " I agreed , " it certainly does .
