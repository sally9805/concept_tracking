Here , our handbook on the private life of your man 's private parts . // TOOL TIME 7 ways to keep his johnson happy ( it 's not what you think ) When a man begins having penis problems , he 'll usually respond in two ways : avoid discussing the issue and wish that the trouble would disappear . But these reactions pose major health risks . So it 's often up to the women in their lives to look after their man 's sexual health .

Although testicular cancer is rare in African-American men ( about 2 in 100,000 cases are diagnosed each year , according to the American Cancer Society ) , Baker suggests that your man perform monthly self-exams . He should feel his testicles for abnormal lumps and look for any changes in size , texture or appearance . Clean up . Within an hour after sex , he should urinate and wash his penis to get rid of any vaginal or anal bacteria . Drink less . " Many men mistakenly assume that alcohol improves sexual performance , " Baker says . " But moderate intoxication will impair lovemaking skills . " More serious is chronic alcoholism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get erections , " he warns . Another damaging habit is smoking , which can lower sperm count and decrease sperm mobility-not good for wanna-be dads . Eat healthy . " A low-fat diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables is best for good sexual function , " Baker says . " Fat causes hardening of the arteries , which can reduce blood flow to the penis and result in erectile problems . " Decreasing fat intake , particularly saturated fat ( found mainly in animal products ) , is also thought to lower the risk of developing prostate cancer , says Jeannette Jordan , a registered dietician and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . Exercise . Kegel exercises , which women can perform to strengthen pelvic muscles and heighten sexual pleasure , can also be done by men . " The exercises can prevent premature ejaculation and heighten orgasmic pleasure , " says Cedric Bryant , Ph.D. , chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise in San Diego .

Briefs hug the testicles to the body , and it 's possible that wearing them can slightly raise the sperm 's temperature , and heat can kill sperm . In fact , it 's the scrotum 's job to maintain the testicles at their ideal temperature , about 93.6F . Keep moving . " Exercise can resuscitate a dying libido , " Bryant says . " It promotes feelgood endorphins for increased arousal , improves blood circulation for better penis function , and helps prevent obesity , which can lead to impotence .

PROSTATE CANCER UPDATE Get the facts on how you can help protect your man Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men , and Black men are 66 percent more likely than White men to develop the disease and two to three times more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cancer Society . But if caught early , prostate cancer is one of the most curable forms of cancer . Isaac Powell , M.D. , a professor of urology at Wayne State University in Detroit and a prostatecancer survivor himself , spells out what Black women and their men need to know about screening , diagnosis Photograph // and treatment : By Aliyah Baruchin ESSENCE : What is the prostate ? Powell : The prostate is a gland located at the base of the bladder . It has two functions : It opens and closes the urethra , the tube through which urine flows from the bladder to the penis , and it produces semen , which provides nutrients to the sperm and allows sperm to move in the vagina . ESSENCE : What are the symptoms of prostate cancer ? Powell : Unfortunately prostate cancer does n't have any specific symptoms , particularly in the early stages . Some patients may complain of nocturia , meaning they get up more than twice a night to urinate , or they may have blood in their urine or have difficulty urinating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , and you can have prostate cancer without any symptoms . That 's why getting tested regularly is so important . ESSENCE : What are the tests ? Powell : Prostate cancer screening consists of two tests . The first is a digital rectal examination ( DRE ) , in which the doctor inserts his finger in the patient 's rectum and feels the prostate for any nodules or hard areas . Men should also get a prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) blood test , which measures the amount of a protein produced by the prostate gland . A PSA between zero and four is normal . An abnormal PSA does n't automatically mean a person has this form of cancer , but it is a cause for further investigation . The PSA is about 40 to 45 percent accurate ; the DRE about 20 to 25 percent accurate . Combined , the tests can provide close to 65 percent accuracy . ESSENCE : Who should be screened ? Powell : Black men and anyone with a close relative who has had prostate cancer should be tested annually starting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men more likely to get this disease and die from it ? Powell : We 're not sure . Genetics may play a part . Researchers are investigating whether certain abnormal genes that may be more prevalent in African-Americans cause prostate cancers to develop more frequently and grow more aggressively . And there are a number of reasons the mortality rate for African-American men is so high . One is diet ; we know that a high-fat diet causes prostate cancer to progress , and Black men tend to have a fattier diet . In addition , African-Americans are less likely to be screened for this illness and are less likely to seek treatment . This is usually out of fear-of the DRE , of the diagnosis and of the treatment , which can result in the loss of sexual function . ESSENCE : What are the treatment options ? Powell : Traditional treatments include radical prostatectomy , in which the entire gland is removed . The benefit of this approach is that if the cancer is confined within the capsule of the gland , the cure rate is 95 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impotency is 50 percent . Another treatment is external beam radiation therapy , an outpatient procedure . Alternative procedures include the use of radiation seeds , which are implanted in the prostate , and cryosurgery , in which ice is injected into the prostate to freeze it . But all these treatments carry the risk of losing some form of sexual function . ESSENCE : Is that why men avoid getting the necessary screening ? Powell : Oh , yes . When I counsel patients about treatment options , I typically talk to the men and their wives , and I 've had men tell me that if they ca n't function sexually , they 'd rather be dead . The wives , of course , think their husbands have lost their mind . But I remind these men that there are some great new treatments for impotence , such as Viagra . ESSENCE : How has your personal experience with prostate cancer affected your work ? Powell : I 'm a five-year prostate-cancer survivor . Experiencing the disease firsthand has made me even more committed . Once I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hopeful . " Aliyah Baruchin writes about health and lives in New Rochelle , New York . EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 9 surprising reasons he may not be able to rise to the occasion Almost every man at some point in his life will experience temporary , situational impotency . But an estimated 30 million American men suffer from full or partial erectile dysfunction ( ED ) , the inability to have or maintain an erection satisfactory for intercourse , according to the National Institutes of Health . But while erectile dysfunction may be a source of embarrassment and frustration for him , it can also indicate health problems . " Most men consider ED to be more of a psychological problem than a medical one , " says Gerald P Hoke , M.D. , chief of urology at Harlem Hospital in New York City . " But it may signal a systemic disease that should be treated . " By Aliyah Baruchin According to Hoke , erectile dysfunction is most often caused by diabetes , hypertension and high cholesterol , all of which are more prevalent in African-Americans and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has difficulty obtaining an erection , he ca n't just chalk it up to getting old , and he should n't be ashamed to talk about it , " says Hoke . " The most important thing is to see a doctor . " Below is a list of other possible causes of erectile dysfunction . Photograph // Heart disease or vascular problems can inhibit the amount of blood that enters the penis , hindering the ability to achieve an erection . A primary-care physician can test for these problems and make referrals to a cardiologist or vascular surgeon for treatment . In some cases , treating the underlying cause successfully , such as getting blood pressure under control , can help improve sexual function . Commonly prescribed medications such as cimetidine ( used to treat ulcers ) , antihistamines , antidepressants and tranquilizers can cause erectile dysfunction by interfering with nerve impulses or blood flow to the penis , Taking certain blood-pressure medication , particularly beta-blockers , can sometimes result in erectile dysfunction . But if this happens to your man , he should ask his doctor about switching medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as smoking , drug use ( especially cocaine or opiates like heroin ) and excessive alcohol consumption can affect sexual function . Physical trauma to the pelvis , sometimes the result of something as simple as frequent bike riding on a hard and narrow seat , can cause ED by compressing the blood vessels and nerves connected to the penis . Nerve disorders such as Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and spinal-cord and brain injuries , which interrupt nerve impulses from the brain to the penis , can lead to erectile dysfunction . Irregular hormone levels are responsible for 5 percent of erectile-dysfunction cases , according to the American Foundation for Urologic Disease . Low testosterone levels can be treated with testosterone injections , skin patches or a topical gel applied to the skin . &gt; DOWN  --  THERE SCARES 4 potential problems that can hit him below the belt Compared with the female anatomy , a man 's sexual organs seem deceptively straightforward , but looks can be deceiving . The good news is that " Most urological conditions can be treated or managed if medical attention is sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a urologist Photograph // in Atlanta and chairwoman for the urology section of the National Medical Association . Be on the lookout for these conditions : By Nancy Rones Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) : A noncancerous enlargement of the prostate that can cause urination problems . The risk of BPH increases with age . According to the American Urological Association , BPH affects 50 percent of men between the ages of 51 and 60 , and up to 90 percent over age 80 . Doctors do n't know what causes it , but several medications have been successful in treating it , including alpha blockers , which help relax prostate muscles , and finasteride , a drug that shrinks the prostate gland . There are also nonsurgical heat therapies that use laser and microwave . If drug therapy is unsuccessful , surgery offers the best long-term solution for relieving symptoms . The most common surgical procedure is transurethral resection of the prostate , in which excess prostate tissue is removed to reduce pressure on the urethra . Balanitis : It 's an infection of the foreskin and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition can also result from an allergic reaction to soaps , detergent or other chemicals and is more common in uncircumcised men . Treatment depends on the underlying cause , but common methods include antifungal creams , antibiotics and topical gels . Balanitis is usually not considered serious , although repeated bouts may signal diabetes , warns Foote . Penile injury : A penis caught in a zipper is n't that far-fetched . Foote advises cutting the zipper , rather than pulling down on it , to minimize the damage . A penis can also be damaged during intercourse if the penis hits against a woman 's pubic bone , although it 's rare . It 's uncommon for a penis to be injured during sports since a flaccid penis is flexible and in a reasonably protected location , and men commonly wear protective cups . If the testicles are struck , it can cause pain , bruising and swelling , but often is not serious . Priapism : His erection does n't go down , even after ejaculation , because of obstructed blood in the penis . Sickle-cell disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . " If a man has an erection for a few hours , he should be brought to the emergency room , " says Foote . If priapism is not relieved within 24 hours , permanent impotency may result . Once the underlying cause is diagnosed , the doctor may inject medication into the penis or insert a needle to drain the excess blood . If the erection still does not subside , surgery may be required . o Sidebar * A man 's diet can affect the taste of his semen .

Sidebar The Cervical Cancer  --  Circumcision Link Sidebar Whether your man is circumcised or not can have big implications for your health . Uncircumcised men have n't had their foreskin-the loose skin that covers the head of the penis-surgically removed . And women who have sex with them run a higher risk of developing cervical cancer , says a report published last April by the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Barcelona , Spain . Researchers examined data from previous studies of more than 1,900 couples in five countries . In fact , among couples in which the man was uncircumcised and had at least six sex partners , the risk of his partner getting cervical cancer was more than double that of partners of circumcised men with multiple partners . Uncircumcised men were three to five times more likely to be infected by the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which they may then pass on to their partners through sexual intercourse . This virus can cause genital warts in both men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't certain why being snipped protects against HPV infection , but they suspect that the inside surface of the foreskin is more vulnerable to infection than other penile skin . The bottom line ? " Whether her partner 's circumcised or not , a woman needs to take a proactive role in her health care , " says Beth Y. Kadan , M.D. , director of gynecological oncology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles . " Using condoms can significantly reduce her risk of contracting HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases . And women should have a Pap smear at least once each year . " // <p>
