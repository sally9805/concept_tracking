<p> According to Richard Petty , being a NASCAR champion is kind of like being Miss America : You smile , you schmooze and  --  bingo !  --  people pay attention to your cause . <p> As NASCAR 's gentlemanly ambassador for three decades , Petty , 65 , gave the rest of America a taste of an exclusively Southern sport . Then came current champion Jeff Gordon , who pushed stock car racing closer to the mainstream with Hollywood looks and a game-show-host personality . <p> But the Mr. Congeniality sash hardly fits Tony Stewart , whose 2002 accomplishments include three victories , more than $ 4.6 million in prize money  --  and one photographer-shoving incident at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in August that nearly cost him his job and spurred him to add an anger-management counselor to his race-weekend posse . <p> Barring an unprecedented meltdown , Stewart will clinch his first Winston Cup title in Sunday 's season finale , the Ford 400 . In many respects the 31-year-old Indiana native is a throwback to a time when racing not only tolerated , but celebrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its corporate sponsors expect drivers to project a polished , good-guy image . And within that context , Stewart , a short-fused fountain of sarcasm , stands out like an imported car on the Talladega infield . <p> Petty says it 's time for the sport 's soon-to-be leading man to start acting more grown up . " People become role models , not because they want to . That 's an obligation that they get by doing the job they want to do , " says Petty , a seven-time series champion . " So that job does n't just constitute driving a race car . If the people before him had treated the people as he treats them today , then there would n't be no Tony Stewart running Winston Cup  --  because there would n't be no Winston Cup . " <p> NASCAR 's executives could count on recent champions such as Gordon , Dale Jarrett and Bobby Labonte to handle the off-track duties of a champion : promoting the sport during a weeklong media tour in New York , then becoming what three-time series champion Darrell Waltrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps , offering opinions on racing issues . <p> Nobody in NASCAR 's Daytona Beach , Fla. , offices knows quite how Stewart might handle such expectations . Although he can come off as intelligent and even charming in relaxed situations , he often needs prodding from his handlers to attend organized news conferences . While most drivers politely endure the most mindless of questions for the sake of promoting their image and their sponsor , Stewart is more likely to roll his eyes and make a snide comment . <p> How would that act play on Live with Regis and Kelly ? <p> " Look , Tony understands his situation better than anybody , and I think Indianapolis was a wake-up call for him , " says NASCAR vice president of communications Jim Hunter , a trusted adviser of chairman Bill France Jr . " He 'll be a great champion . I think he 'll go out of his way to put his best foot forward . " <p> Selling the sport <p> More established pro sports do n't spend time debating whether their champions will do a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an overt blessing from corporate America , NASCAR has n't completely sold cultural barometers such as Jay Leno , big-city newspapers and ESPN 's SportsCenter on the notion stock car racing is as big time as baseball and basketball . <p> " How do we get the clout that other major sports leagues get ? How do we get on the front page instead of the back page ? " asks Waltrip , now a Fox TV analyst . " We do it with our drivers . " <p> Petty , Waltrip , Gordon and others have played a vital role in the advancement of NASCAR , but there 's work to do . Stewart , however , does n't seem up for it . <p> " Maybe I 'm wrong about this , but the last time I checked , we were running for a points championship , not political office , " Stewart says . " I 've not been told of any quote-unquote responsibilities . If everybody 's going to make it a lot more complicated than that , I 'm going to be pretty disappointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David M. Carter , principal of the Los Angeles-based Sports Business Group , says having a champion with a few rough edges might help NASCAR attract casual fans , " even if it just comes down to marketing him as Darth Vader , the opposite of milk-and-cookies Jeff Gordon . " <p> Like most major sports leagues , NASCAR uses fines and suspensions to keep competitors in line . But NASCAR has a separate and unique disciplinary dynamic : Without corporate sponsorships that have risen dramatically since the early 1990s , big-budget race teams would n't exist  --  and drivers would n't have fancy lakefront houses or private airplanes . <p> In return , sponsors expect drivers to steer clear of anything that could be perceived as controversial . Waltrip says that has sucked some of the life out of the sport . <p> " There 's too much of that , " Waltrip says . " That 's what sponsors do to you : The bigger they get , the more scared you get . You start looking at how much you 're making , and you get scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came not from NASCAR but in the form of a $ 50,000 fine from his sponsor Home Depot . NASCAR fined him $ 10,000 and put him on probation through Dec. 31 . Home Depot officials did not answer an interview request , but Stewart said after the incident that he came close to getting fired . <p> " Any action by Tony would obviously have an effect on The Home Depot , " says Stewart 's team owner , former NFL coach Joe Gibbs . " So there were just a series of serious discussions there between us and them . . . . We were never close to saying , ' Tony , you 're fired . ' But you obviously know that any driver here could do things that would cost him his job . " <p> Act out Sunday , and you 're likely to get a call from your sponsor Monday . <p> " Oh , yeah , and ( we ) should , because we are representing those people , " says current driver Kyle Petty , 42 , Richard 's son . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm wearing a Sprint uniform and I scream at somebody on TV and they get it all on film , would I get a call from the sponsor ? Yes , just like the guy who does customer service ( would ) if I call up and say my phone 's not working and he starts screaming at me . I 'm a representative of Sprint . " <p> One result , Kyle Petty says , is that drivers tend to avoid the legal scrapes and court appearances seen in other sports . But the byproduct of drivers ' relatively good behavior is that any sort of outburst gets blown out of proportion  --  such as when Stewart had to be restrained while yelling at NASCAR officials after a race in July 2001 at Daytona and then knocked a tape recorder out of a reporter 's hand . <p> " OK , we have n't choked a coach , we have n't shot a limo driver , we have n't been in rehab . That 's controversy , " Petty says . " This is not controversy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wise to tone down his act for mainstream talk shows . But in general , Carter says , Stewart 's attitude differentiates him from other drivers and , as long as it does n't seem contrived by NASCAR 's marketing department , might help him earn more endorsements . " It will be important to his cash flow long term that he deliver on that surliness without going overboard , " Carter says . <p> Gibbs says every driver has a temper but most learn how to control it . " He does n't hide things , " Gibbs says of Stewart . <p> But Gibbs also says Stewart is " making progress " in counseling . <p> Says Richard Petty : " I know he 's probably been to them shrink doctors and been talked to , but he 's the one . It 's his mind . He 's got to accept that stuff in his mind . " <p> Gordon is perhaps the best mainstream evangelist NASCAR has had . Perhaps no professional athlete is as polished as Gordon , who looks just as comfortable guest-hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 185 mph . <p> " I think , single-handedly , he has moved this sport up a notch , maybe two , " Waltrip says . <p> But Gordon sticks up for Stewart , saying the champion 's obligation to promote the sport is somewhat overrated . <p> " They deserve it because they earned it , OK ? " Gordon says . " This whole , ' I 've got to represent the sport and I 've got to say all the right things and look pretty and smile , ' that 's not what makes you a great champion . " <p> Although Gordon and Stewart have had a few on-track run-ins , Gordon 's support of Stewart is no surprise ; the vast majority of drivers and others who work in racing seem to genuinely like Stewart . When a fan accused Stewart of shoving her after a race in late August  --  the charge was investigated and later dropped  --  Jarrett , a respected veteran , stood up during a pre-race drivers meeting and voiced support for Stewart . <p> " Should he change his personality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think Tony should change , " Kyle Petty says . " I do n't think we should all be cookie-cutter people , either . " <p> Says Gibbs : " My hope would be that the world kind of gets to see the real Tony Stewart  --  the guy that , when he 's away from the racetrack , is kind of laid-back , not hyper , enjoys talking to people , spends extra time at the autograph deals , goes out of his way to say stuff to kids . I think you get him around the racetrack , and he 's one kind of guy . You get him away from the racetrack , he 's a different guy . " <p> People 's champion ? <p> Gordon 's advice to Stewart : be yourself . " Do n't get mad because somebody criticizes the way you did or said something . If that 's your opinion , man , go with it . " <p> But maybe it 's OK that Stewart 's not as polished as Gordon . <p> " He 's not the white-collar Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-collar guy . He 's a little bit in the Earnhardt mold , a modern-day A.J. Foyt . I think it 's great . You 've got to have a balance , man . " <p> Some fans are put off by Stewart 's behavior , but others can identify with him . Much like the people who sit in the grandstands or watch NASCAR on TV , Stewart likes to sleep late , play video games and eat fast food . Sometimes he 's too lazy to shave . Above all , he 'll drop everything for a midweek race on some Midwest dirt track against a bunch of no-names . <p> " How cool could it be to have the Winston Cup champion run a dirt race in Iowa somewhere ? I think that 's huge , " Kyle Petty says . " That represents the sport in a different way than what you guys ( the media ) are looking for . <p> " I 'd say Jeff Gordon or guys like that take the sport to the boardroom . I think Tony Stewart can take the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances are he 's going to feel like taking it to Des Moines . He 's going to feel like taking it to the grass roots of America , and I think he 's going to be more of a people 's champion than a Jeff Gordon is . And that 's not a knock on Jeff Gordon , believe me . It 's just a different type of person .
