The Reno legacy ? Seven-plus years of defending Clinton instead of the law . <p> The U.S. Department of Justice is the government agency directly responsible for performing the president 's central constitutional mission to " take care " that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed . Those laws have come to reach into every aspect of American life , from jobs , environment , civil rights , elections , taxation , communications and antitrust , to tens of thousands of federal criminal laws covering everything from kidnapping to poultry inspection . <p> The Justice Department oversees several of the most feared and potentially intrusive federal agencies , including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Immigration and Naturalization Service , and the Bureau of Prisons . The department 's prosecutors have relatively unfettered discretion to bring down the full force of the government 's investigative and prosecutorial powers on private citizens . <p> The Department of Justice thus both implements and symbolizes the rule of law in the United States . It is imperative , therefore , that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint . Abuse or misuse of those powers has devastating and lasting consequences , not just for the individuals directly affected , but , more fundamentally , for the nation 's integrity and for the confidence that citizens must have in their government if they are to honor and respect its laws and institutions . <p> The department and its officials traditionally have been held to a standard of independence and non-partisanship not expected at other federal agencies . While the president has the prerogative to set broad law enforcement policies , and occasionally to participate directly in those DOJ decisions that influence the nation 's direction and priorities , the president must never interject his personal or partisan political impulses into individual DOJ decisions . And it is one of the most important responsibilities of the attorney general to insist that the line between national policy and personal advantage never be crossed . Whenever that barrier has been breached in the past , whenever politics has permeated the decision-making or the atmosphere at the Department of Justice , as occurred in Watergate , the consequences for the nation have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half years as attorney general , longer than all but one of her predecessors , an individual who held office in the early nineteenth century when there was no Department of Justice , when the attorney general 's staff was tiny , and the responsibilities of the office were quite limited . To put her tenure in perspective , Richard Kleindienst , Elliot Richardson , William Saxbe , Ed Levi , and Griffin Bell held the position of attorney general in the 1970 's . Janet Reno has served longer than all of them combined . No person in American history has held more law enforcement authority for such a long period . <p> It may be some time before an authoritative judgment is made concerning Janet Reno 's stewardship of the Department of Justice . Much of the story remains concealed behind the iron doors of Main Justice in Washington , and some of it may never be known , especially if Janet Reno is succeeded by an Al Gore Department of Justice . Bill Clinton 's worst nightmare is a George W. Bush-appointed attorney general who will have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has kept during its corrupt reign and a Congress that will keep the Justice Department shredding machines out of operation between November and the inauguration . <p> But the public record already tells enough to portray an unattractive story of a Clinton political takeover of the Justice Department . There is ample evidence that can not be ignored that , from the beginning , Janet Reno allowed her department to be overwhelmed by partisan politics and that she readily submitted to the personal and private interests of President Clinton and his partner in running the department , First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . Space permits only a limited review , but what follows is a partial evaluation of Janet Reno 's tenure according to commonly accepted standards for measuring the work of her department . RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW <p> The attorney general 's most important responsibility is to insure that the White House and the administration respect the rule of law and live up to the highest legal and ethical standards . By this measure , it is difficult to assign to Janet Reno anything other than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both civil and criminal proceedings . A federal judge has found him in contempt of court for willful obstruction of justice . The president manipulated witnesses , lied to his cabinet , including the attorney general , and set in motion a massive and meticulously coordinated campaign to destroy a duly appointed , lawfully empowered , independent counsel . <p> The first lady has , to put the most charitable possible spin on it , made false statements under oath and concealed evidence from Congress and criminal investigators . The Office of Counsel to the President has been dedicated in substantial part to the obstruction and delay of lawful investigations under the leadership of the president 's long-time friend and accomplice Bruce Lindsey . <p> When Deputy Counsel to the President Vincent Foster was found dead of a gunshot wound , White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum prevented Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann from conducting a proper investigation . The attorney general not only did not raise a finger in protest , she allowed the investigation to be conducted , not by her department and the FBI , but by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that it would investigate an apparent suicide of an African-American teenager in Mississippi . But the mysterious death of a top White House official was sent elsewhere . <p> Under five administrations going back to Richard Nixon , executive privilege could not be asserted by the president without the written endorsement of the attorney general . This vital check on the exercise of presidential power was snatched from Janet Reno 's department and handed over to White House lawyers working for Bruce Lindsey . <p> The public record can be searched in vain for a single word of protest by Attorney General Reno concerning these , and many , many other abusive acts by the president of the United States , the first lady , and White House confidants and attorneys , which not only eroded respect for the rule of law but weakened the department 's ability to do its job . If the attorney general can not stop the subversion of the nation 's laws by the president under whom she holds office , she must resign . Attorney General Reno did neither . THE COMPETENCE , PROFESSIONALISM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged in substantial part by the quality and integrity of their subordinates , and by their insistence that they be selected on their merit and for their commitment to the rule of law . <p> Janet Reno failed this test and succumbed to political pressures before the ink was dry on her appointment . Only days after she took office , she ordered the removal of all 93 of the nation 's United States attorneys . In order to maintain continuity in thousands of pending prosecutions , and as a statement to the public that elections do not influence routine law enforcement , the nation 's top prosecutors are traditionally replaced only after their successors have been located , appointed and confirmed by the Senate . On instructions from the White House , ( she claimed it was a " joint " decision ; no one believes that ) Reno ordered all 93 to leave in ten days . <p> There could not have been a clearer signal that the Clinton campaign war room had taken over law enforcement in America . And few observers missed the point that Reno 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbent U.S. attorney in Little Rock , the location of so many Clinton family skeletons bursting to get out of their respective closets . Janet Reno filled that particular post with a former Bill Clinton student , someone who had worked in every one of his gubernatorial campaigns and the Clinton-Gore 1992 election effort . The world was to learn later how helpful the new U.S. attorney was in aborting federal investigations into Clinton involvement in the looting of federally insured Arkansas thrifts . <p> Sacking the nation 's front-line prosecutors was just the beginning . Janet Reno watched as Hillary 's Wellesley roommate and close friend was placed in charge of the department 's legal policy apparatus and the selection of judges . The sister of Hillary 's close friend and former law partner , Vince Foster , took over the department 's relationships with Congress , the better to prevent unpleasant departmental leaks to congressional investigators . Al Gore 's brother-in-law was handed the all-powerful civil division . A wife of a Democratic senator took over antitrust policy . Robert Kennedy 's daughter and a key Senator Ted Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former chief of staff of the Democratic National Committee . The department 's reputation for nonpartisanship became a quaint memory . <p> Looming over all these appointments , including Janet Reno , herself , was the now-infamous Webster Hubbell , yet another former Hillary Clinton law partner . Hubbell was installed as the Clintons ' eyes , ears , and voice in the department before Janet Reno even arrived . He moved immediately into the office adjacent to the attorney general 's quarters , space traditionally occupied by the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel . OLC has long been considered the department 's legal conscience , and its proximity to the attorney general reinforced that office 's ability to insure that legal considerations trumped politics at the Justice Department . The message of the Hubbell move was not lost on department officials . Janet Reno had the title , but the White House would be running things . That impression was underscored when Reno went off to give a trivial speech as the Waco disaster unfolded . Webster Hubbell , not the attorney general , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When Hubbell resigned a year later , under investigation for stealing from his former clients and law partners , Attorney General Reno demonstrated her acute judgment of character and her utter obliviousness of what was going on around her . Hubbell , she declared , " has been a tireless crusader for Justice , for doing the right thing . I do n't believe he did a thing wrong . " ABUSE AND ATTACK <p> Perhaps the harshest indictment that can be levied against the Reno Justice Department is that it allowed itself to be misused , again and again , to pursue and punish those whom the Clinton White House perceived as enemies , or merely obstacles . The first instance was one of the most egregious . When the first lady decided to remove White House Travel Office employees and replace them with cronies from Arkansas and Hollywood , the career workers were given two hours to get out . Not satisfied with a simple purge , the White House then manipulated the FBI to make it appear that the Travel Office employees were under criminal investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the White House to back down and find jobs for most of the disgraced and humiliated workers , the Department of Justice went after the head of the office with a vengeance . Billy Dale had started in the office 30 years earlier under President John F. Kennedy . He worked his way to the top and was uniformly well-liked by the White House press corps , whom he helped to serve . Justice investigated him for 18 months and then prosecuted him for embezzlement . The evidence at the trial was so contrived , flimsy , and laughable that the jurors could not figure out why the charges had been brought . They acquitted in two hours . <p> The Billy Dale incident showed Washington not only how ruthless the Clintons could be in using government power to further their own ambitions , but also , sadly , that the immense power of the Justice Department could be used and abused to destroy a career just to make a Clinton point . <p> Manipulation by the Clinton administration of the Justice Department has repeatedly blemished Reno 's tenure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush administration officials were requisitioned by the White House from the FBI . These files then became accessible by White House political functionaries including people later found to have been involved in creating a White House database , a favorite Hillary Clinton project . The press has often commented how quickly the Clinton political machine is able to respond to an attack with a savage and personally damaging counterattack against any accuser . That defense mechanism requires information  --  and the Justice Department has information . <p> During the Kenneth Starr independent counsel Whitewater investigation , rumors surfaced from the teenage son of an Arkansan tarot card reader that Clinton Little Rock accuser David Hale had received financial assistance from this magazine . When this unsubstantiated charge from a manifestly unreliable source reached Janet Reno 's Department of Justice , it reacted as if the Attorney General 's Office had been fire-bombed . Its normal standards for launching a criminal investigation were tossed out the window as Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder put public pressure on Starr to launch a criminal probe that would require scrutiny of the magazine that reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prolonged . It led nowhere . But the message had been sent . Governmental prosecutorial power was there to be used , even against the press , and the First Amendment be damned . SHIELDING THE WHITE HOUSE <p> While the Reno Justice Department has been quick to investigate those who find themselves on the Clintons ' enemies list , the president , the first lady , the vice president , and senior White House staff have been treated as if coated with an invisible plastic shield . <p> The Clinton-Gore re-election campaign finance " investigation " is the most outrageous example . The independent counsel law in place during most of the years in question required the attorney general to seek the appointment of an independent counsel if she found a reasonable basis for investigating whether " covered persons , " including the president , vice president , and certain top White House and campaign officials , had committed federal crimes . The attorney general managed to turn this law on its head into a barrier precluding her investigators from looking into any evidence that covered persons might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation was deftly transformed into a shield against any serious scrutiny . <p> In October 1997 , Washington Post reporters Susan Schmidt and Robert Suro disclosed that the department 's investigators had been instructed that the independent counsel law " prohibited them from looking at the activities of covered persons , " and not to " ask anyone whether a covered person committed a crime . " As a result , any time the investigation seemed to be getting near the president , vice president , or top White House or Democratic Party officials , the investigators turned their attention elsewhere . <p> In July 1997 , Laura Ingersoll , head of the fundraising investigation , actually quashed FBI efforts to search the home of notorious Clinton fundraiser Charlie Trie in Little Rock despite reports that Trie was destroying key documents . Justice lawyers had refused for four months to allow agents to ask for a search warrant for Trie 's home . When Ingersoll learned that the search had somehow finally been approved , she aborted the search and recalled the agents from Little Rock . An FBI agent said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue any matter related to solicitation of funds ... for the President ... because that 's the way the American political process works . " <p> After the fundraising scandal had been on the front pages of the nation 's papers for months , New York Times columnist William Safire reported that one of the central figures in the illicit fundraising , John Huang , had never been interviewed , asked to testify , or required to produce any records . Safire also reported that after Laura Ingersoll was removed as head of the investigation , for what was widely perceived both inside and outside the department as an incompetent , at best , investigation , Reno gave her a special departmental commendation praising her dedication and the thoroughness of her work . <p> On numerous occasions , Reno insisted that her periodic decisions not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the Clinton-Gore fundraising abuses were based on recommendations from career prosecutors . It was later learned that FBI Director Louis Freeh and other top FBI officials had urged in writing in the strongest possible terms the appointment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand-picked replacement for Laura Ingersoll , advised the attorney general that Reno " had no alternative but to seek an appointment of an independent prosecutor . " Even the criminal division 's Robert Litt , described as a Democratic Party loyalist and " friend of Bill , " twice urged that an independent counsel be appointed to investigate whether Vice President Gore had lied to FBI agents in connection with his fundraising . Finally , Robert Conrad , the current head of the fundraising task force , is now known to have recommended appointing a special counsel to investigate these matters . Attorney General Reno rejected every one of these recommendations from experienced , career prosecutors at the very highest levels of the investigations . <p> Reno initially decided that Gore 's telephone calls from government property to raise campaign funds were not illegal because there was " clear and convincing evidence that he was only seeking ' soft ' money , " and that soft money fundraising was somehow not prohibited by the statute . The DOJ task force was accordingly told to stop investigating . When the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , raising hard money , Reno declined to seek an independent counsel investigation based on her freshly-minted conclusion that the vice president did not know that he was raising hard money . <p> Unfortunately for Gore , evidence continued to seep out . No problem . In her most recent rejection of calls for an independent look at Gore 's role in raising hard money from government telephones , Reno managed to levitate above indisputable evidence that the vice president had attended a lengthy meeting at which that subject was discussed , handwritten notes by a top Gore staffer that showed that hard money fundraising was an important subject during the meeting , and testimony by Clinton 's Chief of Staff Leon Panetta that Gore had been listening attentively during that portion of the meeting . Reno nonetheless bounded to the astonishing conclusion that " there is no evidence that he heard the statements about the hard money or understood their implications . " <p> While Reno defenders point to the number of independent counsel appointments she did seek , it is simply impossible to frame a rational explanation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton-Gore years was never permitted to be investigated by persons not appointed by and working for Bill and Hillary Clinton . POLITICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION <p> Janet Reno 's Justice Department has proved particularly solicitous respecting matters of political interest to the White House . For example , when it came to clemency for imprisoned Puerto Rican terrorists , an issue of potential significance to the first lady 's New York Senate campaign , the Department of Justice forwarded a pardon report concerning the 16 terrorists to the president despite strong and unanimous opposition by the FBI , the Bureau of Prisons , and the U.S. attorneys in Illinois and Connecticut . According to the New York Times , the Justice Department report " suggested a diversity of views within law enforcement agencies that did not exist . " The Times reported that " the Justice Department took extraordinary steps to enhance the chances for clemency " for the Puerto Rican terrorists " after receiving ... expressions of interest from the White House . " In fact , the applications for clemency were processed by the department even though the terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case against the tobacco industry is another example of the department throwing its legal principles out the window in response to the president 's political desires . In 1997 , Attorney General Reno told the Senate Judiciary Committee that there was no federal legal basis for suing the tobacco companies . In January of 1999 , President Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that he had instructed the Department of Justice to sue the tobacco companies . In October of 1999 , the suit was filed . <p> Although Janet Reno repeatedly , albeit reluctantly , approved expansions of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 's jurisdiction to investigate President Clinton , she ultimately came to join forces with the White House campaign to delay and impede Starr 's investigation and to discredit his efforts . Early on , her department filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting the president 's assertion that the Paula Jones civil suit should be suspended for the duration of the Clinton presidency . The Supreme Court rejected the argument 9-0 . Justice lawyers then filed briefs endorsing the White House claim that communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starr 's subpoena , on behalf of the government , because of a government attorney-client privilege that could be asserted  --  against the government ! And Justice fiercely supported claims that Secret Service agents could not be made to testify about things they may have heard or seen based upon an unprecedented claim of a " protective service " privilege . These and other White House delaying tactics were ultimately rejected by the courts , but the Justice Department support added valuable credibility to the White House arguments , and served to gain the president valuable time in his fight against impeachment . <p> DOJ officials also debriefed Secret Service officials after their grand jury testimony in the Starr investigation and the gist of that testimony was circulated to the Clinton defense team . <p> Finally , as Clinton 's impeachment trial began in the Senate , Reno sent Starr a letter informing him that the department was opening an investigation of his handling of the Monica Lewinsky matter and " potentially unethical contacts with the lawyers pursuing Paula Jones ' sexual harassment suit against Clinton . " Janet Reno thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the independent counsel law prevented Reno from any direct interference in Starr 's investigation , she would do so indirectly by investigating Starr himself . <p> Space has not permitted a discussion of the unaccountable delays and inexplicable decisions in the campaign finance investigation that allowed witnesses to flee the country , evidence to disappear , and potential defendants to coordinate their stories . Nor has this account examined the numerous sweetheart plea bargains that resulted in the surrender of leverage over key witnesses in that investigation . The curious inability of the Justice Department to examine the government-owned computer of Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee , and the strange investigation and prosecution that have followed is another important piece of the mosaic , as is the near-tragic , prolonged bumbling of the Elian Gonzalez case . The non-prosecution of the Defense Department officials who opened Linda Tripp 's classified personnel files to a Clinton-friendly New Yorker reporter , and the Justice Department vendetta against Kenneth Starr press aide Charles Bakaly , are other incidents that scream out for scrutiny . <p> But these events , and a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Department of Justice that was captured in early 1993 and has been directed by an intensely political and single-mindedly partisan White House . And an attorney general who has not only turned a blind eye to lawlessness in government , but who seems utterly unable to prevent the Department of Justice from being used to accomplish political ends . <p> The New York Times has said that " Attorney General Janet Reno has consistently failed to enforce the law against top Clinton Administration officials .... She has an uncanny instinct for ignoring or misreading the evidence and the law when top officials are credibly accused of misconduct . " Unfortunately , this is only a part of Reno 's sad legacy . It will take a strong and principled attorney general and determined efforts to root out the contamination that has occurred and restore the Justice Department to the vital and proud position in government which it once occupied . <p> By Theodore B.
