Chapter Two With the patience of a predator waiting for supper , Duncan leaned against the candy red SUV in the dimly lit parking lot , his arms folded over his chest and his feet crossed at the ankles in a pose that might appear almost languid to anyone who did n't know him . He was soon rewarded by the sight of Willow climbing out the restroom window of his pub ; one shapely jeans-clad leg appearing first , followed by a deliciously firm little butt , followed by another leg , until she was hanging suspended over the sill . Her sweater caught on a protruding nail as her waving feet searched for a toehold , and she suddenly tumbled down over the stack of firewood with a curse loud enough to be heard all the way across the parking lot . Despite his dark mood , Duncan could n't stifle a smile . It was a wonder she could even walk after putting first one foot in her mouth by spilling Rachel 's secret , then cramming in her other foot when she 'd blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . That Rachel had told Duncan she 'd heard Willow on the phone with an old high-school boyfriend earlier also did n't bode well for the sassy-mouthed little brat . He was one second away from dragging Willow home  --  kicking and screaming , if that 's what it took  --  and tying her to his bed and not letting her go until she agreed to marry him . Duncan 's smile widened at the image of her tied to his bed . He watched Willow creep toward freedom while looking over her shoulder at the front corner of the building . A cool ocean breeze was blowing her long , blunt-cut brown hair across her face , the hem of her heavy wool sweater was hiked upover one shapely breast , and there was a smudge of white paint on her left knee . She was also fishing in her pocket for her keys , obviously forgetting that she had the same bad habit as most of the citizens of Puffin Harbor and had left them on the floor of her truck . Those keys were now tucked safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her escape relatively unscathed , Willow started sprinting toward her truck only to finally spot him , swallow a gasp , and skid to a halt just four paces away . Duncan continued to watch in fascination as her chin came up , her shoulders squared , and her large hazel eyes glittered with challenge . Still he did n't move from his insouciant pose , but simply stared back , not saying a word , and waited to see how inventive her lie would be . Lord , he enjoyed her games . She suddenly made a production of looking at her watch , holding her wrist toward the dim light of the streetlamp . " I 'm going to be late , Dunky , " she said with a hint of impatience , lifting one brow as her shimmering gaze returned to his . " Was there something you wanted ? " " Aye . You . " She smoothed her sweater back down into place , settled her hands on her hips , and shook her head . " We both know that 's never going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a word that always comes back to haunt ya . Where are ya going tonight , Willow ? " " If it 's any of your business , I 'm going to visit an old friend I have n't seen since high school . " " All night ? " Her chin rose the slightest bit higher , and her hands on her hips balled into fists . " We 'll probably have a few drinks , so I wo n't be able to drive home . And if I know his wife , she 'll cook a breakfast so big I wo n't be able to walk away from the table , either . " " Ray and Patty Cobb separated three months ago . " Willow 's hands fell from her hips . " They 're separated ? " Her surprise was n't fake , Duncan realized . She truly had n't known . " Aye , " he said quietly . " So tell me , did you call Cobb or did he call you ? " She took a cautious step back , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she stiffened . " How do you know I 'm going to see Ray ? " Her eyes narrowed . " And who told you he and Patty are separated ? " " Your sister just told me , while you were hiding in the restroom , " he said with an indifferent shrug . " As payback , I suppose , for your so eloquently telling Kee she 's pregnant . " Duncan saw her wince . " Rachel 's not even sure yet , " she muttered . She took another step , this one sideways instead of back , obviously hoping to work her way toward her truck door . Duncan was on her before she could react . He caught her around the waist and lifted her up as he turned , dropped her down on the front fender of her truck , and settled himself between her knees so quickly that she had to grab his shoulders to steady herself . He threaded his fingers through her hair and cupped the sides of her face firmly enough to warn her against struggling . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it awareness ? " Come home with me tonight . " " I ca n't , Duncan . And you know why . " There was anger in her whispered response . And also regret . " Then stay and help me finish my bottle of Scotch . " She slowly shook her head inside his hands . " I 'll just find myself waking up in your bed again . " " Eighteen months is a long time to be celibate . " Her face under his hands flushed with heat , and her eyes shimmered defiantly . " What makes you think I 've been celibate ? I 'll have you know I 've had lots of dates in the last year and a half . Probably hundreds , " she said , waving an angry hand over his shoulder . " But not one of those dates ended in bed . " " How do  --  Dammit ! " She squirmed to break free and pushed at his shoulders . " Let me go . I have to go kill my sister ! " He ignored her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long overdue , holding her firmly as he tasted peat-dried barley malt mingled with her own sweet flavor . She stiffened on an indrawn breath , her hands on his shoulders digging into his leather jacket . Duncan dropped his own hand to her backside and slid Willow forward , pulling her pelvis firmly into his . He groaned into her mouth , and with an aggression born of need , deepened the kiss , not backing down until he felt her shudder in response . " Sweet heaven , " he growled , forcing himself to come up for air . " Dammit , Willow , do n't do this to us . You want it as much as I do . " She set trembling , delicate hands on either side of his face , and smiled sadly through passion-bright eyes . " You blew any chance for us eighteen months ago , Duncan , when you took me home , made incredible love to me all night , and then turned into a chest-beating caveman the next morning . " " It 's troglodyte , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a troglodyte . " " Yes , you are , " she whispered back , her own hands tightening on his face . " You 're possessive , protective , and wonderfully physical , and you have n't evolved into this century . If I ever let down my guard with you , for even a minute , I 'd find myself in more trouble than I could handle . " Duncan took her hands from his face and held them securely against his thumping chest . " But that 's the very thing we have going for us , lass . Your own strength matches mine in a way that promises us a lifetime of passion . " " I 'm not capable of making that kind of commitment , Duncan . Ca n't you understand that ? " " Aye , " he said on a sigh , leaning forward and giving her mouth a gentle kiss . He pulled back slightly . " I 've understood that from the beginning . Cancel your date with Cobb . " " I ca n't . " She also released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , really . I 'm meeting Ray tonight because he has something to show me . " Duncan just bet Cobb had something to show her . " Then let me come with you . " She shook her head . " I ca n't . This is business . " " Attorney general business ? " He canted his head . " Your sister said Cobb is a lobsterman . What 's he got that concerns your office ? " Duncan tightened his grip on her hands . " And why did you have to come here to meet him , and at night ? All night , for that matter . " She wiggled to get free , and Duncan allowed her to shove him away and slide down off the fender of her truck . She turned with a snort and finally opened the driver 's door . " This is exactly why we ca n't be together . I ca n't even have a simple meeting without you getting all possessive and protective . I 've been doing my job for over two years now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Go tend your bar . " " I have a staff for that . I 'm taking tonight off . " " You ca n't come with  --  " She stopped in mid-sentence and reached inside her truck , picked up the bottle he 'd set on the seat while waiting for her , and turned back with one brow raised in question . " Pretty damn sure of yourself , are n't you ? " She returned her gaze to the bottle , lifting it toward the street light to read the label . " Rosach Distillery , " she read out loud , looking back up at him . " It 's the same name as your bar  --  The Rosach Pub . " He took the bottle from her . " They 're my silent partner . " " But I thought you bought and remodeled the bar with your share of the reward you and Kee and the others got when you recovered Thaddeus Lakeman 's stolen art ? " " Aye , I did . But I also went into partnership with the Rosach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willow reached into the truck again and reemerged with the small leather box that had been sitting next to the bottle . " What 's this ? " she asked , running a finger over the faded gold letters embossed into the top of it . " Who 's Galen Ross ? " she asked , opening the box . Willow shot him a quick look of surprise , then lifted the tulip-shaped glass from the velvet and held it up to see the etching . " This is the glass I just used inside , " she said , looking back at him . " It has the same crest as the label on the bottle . Who 's Galen Ross ? " she repeated . " My father . " " You have a father ? " she blurted out . She shook her head and smiled . " I mean , I know you did n't really crawl out of a cave , but I never thought of you as having a family . You never talk about them . " He tucked the bottle under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass back in the velvet , and carefully closed the lid . " My father and I were supposed to share this Scotch when it came of age , but he died six years ago . " " I 'm sorry , Duncan , " she said softly . He tucked the bottle and box under his arm . " Life happens " was all he could think to say . " So that 's why you know so much about whisky , " she continued brightly . " Your father worked for the Rosach Distillery . Was he one of those ... what do you call them ? A noser ? " " Aye , Galen Ross had a legendary nose for blending whisky . " " And that 's his nosing glass , " she said , stepping forward and lifting up on her toes as she pulled on the sleeve of his jacket . " Thank you for sharing your special Scotch with me , Duncan , " she whispered . " And for letting me drink from your father 's glass . " She gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed into her truck . Duncan watched her grope around on the floor for her keys , then bend over with a muttered curse and continue her search in front of the passenger 's seat . Duncan took her keys out of his pocket but said nothing , deciding to let the woman 's frustration build  --  even though he knew it would n't even come close to his own . He smiled when she suddenly stilled , his grin widening when she bolted upright , glared at him , and held out her hand . He dangled the keys just out of her reach . " Take me with ya and I promise to be as quiet as a church mouse and not interfere in your work . " She climbed back out of the truck , stood directly in front of him , and stared up with a fierceness that would have worried the devil himself . " Do you trust me , Duncan ? " He relaxed back on his hips and folded the hand holding the keys under his arm holding the Scotch . " I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said softly . " And I trust that ya know what you 're doing when it comes to yar work . But I do n't trust an old boyfriend not to have an agenda . " " Ray and I dated three months , " she snapped , clearly at the end of her patience  --  and seemingly not at all impressed that he trusted her . " I am not interested in Ray Cobb that way . " " Then ya should n't have any problem with my tagging along . " She shoved her hand out again . " You are not coming with me . " He held his own hand over hers , the keys locked in his fist . " Then agree to have dinner with me tomorrow night . " She actually stamped her foot , and Duncan realized she 'd just barely restrained herself from kicking him . " I will not be seen on a date with you . It would only feed the rumors about us . " " Then we 'll eat in . At my house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shin , her mutinous eyes obviously judging her aim . But she looked back up at the sound of her jangling keys as Duncan made them disappear behind the zipper of his jacket , to an inside pocket over his chest . And then her eyes widened when his hand returned not with her keys but with a pen . He stepped forward , the bottle and box tucked firmly under his arm , and took her still extended hand in his and started writing on her palm . Just as he 'd known it would , Willow 's curiosity held her still as she tried to read what he was spelling out in small , bold blue letters . " What does that say ? " she demanded , pulling free the moment he finished . She held her hand flat , facing the light , and squinted down at it . " Potes currere ... " She looked up and scowled at him . " Either you ca n't spell worth a damn , Dunky , or this is n't English . " She looked back down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occulere non potes . " Duncan winced . " Ya 're slaughtering it , lass . " " What language is it ? French ? Latin ? Stone Age gibberish ? And what does it mean ? " He placed the pen back in his pocket , his hand returning empty . " You 're an educated woman , counselor . Do what I did when ya wrote troglodyte on my palm two years ago . Look it up . " Her eyes glittering in the street light , Willow balled her hand into a fist and spun back to her truck with a muttered curse . She climbed in , slammed the door shut behind her , and tripped the electric locks . Then she reached up , pulled down the visor , and took out a hidden key . She shot him a triumphant smile as she crammed the key into the ignition and started the engine . Duncan stepped back with a long-suffering sigh and turned to avoid the parking lot dust and debris shooting out from her screeching tires as Willow exited the parking lot with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to do something about her recklessness , Duncan decided as he loped to his car . He climbed into the right-hand seat , tucked the Scotch and leather box safely under the left-hand seat , fished his own keys out of his pocket , and started the fifteen-year-old Jaguar . The engine rumbled to life with the distinct purr of a jungle beast , and Duncan slowly pulled out of the parking lot . But the moment he turned onto the road , he pushed the powerful engine through the gears , only easing back on the throttle when he caught sight of Willow 's taillights . Aye , he thought with another sigh . The game continued . Not only was their game continuing , Duncan decided thirty minutes later , it was getting curiouser and curiouser . He could have been watching a B movie for all the drama of the scene unfolding through his binoculars : the old fishing pier hugging the shore of the fog-obscured cove , the halo of one weak bulb from the scale house illuminating the two people standing hunched over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by an occasional , distant foghorn . He 'd witnessed this sort of scene more times than he cared to remember , and Duncan 's gut tightened at the thought of Willow being in the middle of this one . Cobb 's personal interest in her was no longer a worry ; it was the situation the man was getting her into that made Duncan break into a cold sweat . When state 's assistant attorneys general met with men who wanted to show them something on a desolate pier at night , it usually meant trouble . Big trouble . Usually more trouble than one tiny woman could handle . Duncan was back to rethinking his plan of dragging Willow home and tying her to his bed . He straightened from leaning over the roof of his car , tossed the binoculars onto the front seat , softly closed the door , and started down the steep hill toward the clandestine meeting . He had no trouble keeping to the shadows as he carefully worked his way out onto the pier , his ears tuned to the silence around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this been going on , Ray ? " Duncan heard Willow whisper . " They started turning up about seven weeks ago , " Cobb answered just as softly . " Just a few at first , and only in my traps closest to the island . And it 's not just the lobsters . Even the crabs look like this . " Duncan inched forward and peered around the end of the scale house , but he still could n't see what Cobb was holding , since the man was standing with his back to him . " Why call me ? " Willow asked . " You should have contacted Marine Resources . " " I did . George White covers this part of the coast , and I told him exactly what I 'm telling you . I even gave him some of my catch . " " And ? " " And he said he 'd look into it , but that was six weeks ago . I called his office several times and they told me he 's gone on vacation . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan heard Willow murmur as she looked back at what Cobb was holding . " What about the other lobstermen ? Are they turning up the same thing ? " Cobb dropped what Duncan guessed was a lobster back into the crate and brushed his hands on his pants . " Yes , " Cobb said , closing the crate and picking it up . " There 's about seven other fishermen who usually set traps around the island . But we 've all had to move them because we ca n't afford to keep throwing back our catch . " Cobb started walking farther out the pier , and Willow fell into step beside him . Duncan silently followed . " And that means we 've started crowding each other , " Cobb continued , stopping beside the gently bobbing roof of a fishing boat . " We 're on the verge of starting a trap war . " " A trap war ? " Cobb snorted . " You know how territorial fishing gets . And we ca n't afford to just pull our traps , so we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting down the crate . " After I called and asked you to come down , I set some traps around the island so you could see for yourself what I 'm talking about . " " And the sick lobster are only coming from this one place ? " Willow asked . " They 're not turning up anywhere else ? " " No . Other than an expected mutation and the occasional blue or harlequin lobster , all 's normal . " The tide was low , and Cobb stepped onto the ladder that ran down to his boat , slid the crate onto its deck , then turned and faced Willow at eye level . " I run almost nine hundred pots from June to October , and about three hundred in winter . I 've been fishing for over ten years , and I 've never seen anything like this . " Duncan could just make out Cobb 's smile as the man held out his hand . " Come on , Willy . It 'll be just like in high school , when I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us would head out to one of the islands for a party . " Dammit , he was not letting Willow get on that boat . Duncan silently moved forward , preparing to rush her , when the beam of a powerful light suddenly cut through the fog , scanning shoreward from the water in a sweeping arc . Duncan stepped back into the shadow of several stacked crates and listened to the muted chug of an engine approaching at idle speed . The searchlight stopped on Willow as she stood on the pier , its beam also catching Cobb in silhouette . " Hey The Corncobb Lady , " the man in the approaching boat hollered . " That you , Ray Cobb ? " Duncan watched as Cobb quickly helped Willow down to the deck of his boat and rushed her into its wheelhouse . Then he climbed back up the ladder and moved down the pier to intercept the boat coming in . " You 're out late tonight , Gramps , " Cobb said , leaning over to catch the roof of the other boat as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope handed to him and tied it off on a large post . " You have engine trouble ? " he continued , moving back to help the old man up the ladder . " Naw . I anchored myself off Pregnant Island and had a nap , " he said with a chuckle . " Next thing I knew , I woke up and it was dark . Already radioed the missus , so she ai n't worried none . " Gramps leaned around Cobb , eyeing the younger man 's boat . " Who you got there , Ray ? I thought I recognized her . " Cobb moved into his line of sight . " Just a friend . " The old man squinted up at him . " You should be working on winning Patty back , not fishing new waters . " He suddenly stiffened . " Willow Foster , " he said , starting toward Cobb 's boat . " That 's who I recognized , damned if it ai n't . " " Go home , Gramps , " Cobb said gently , crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willow Foster . " " I sure hope to hell not , " the old man said , stopping and looking up at Cobb . Duncan slid deeper into the shadows , since the men were only ten feet away now . " I hear that huge Scot over to Puffin Harbor already got a claim on her , " Gramps continued . " He owns The Rosach Pub , and I hear he used to be a ... what you call them ? A fortune soldier or something . Ayuh , " he said with a nod . " Word is he 's trying to take up with that Foster girl , but she ai n't making it easy for him , " he finished with a cackle . He pointed at Cobb 's chest . " You mind whose traps you 're pulling from . That Scot ai n't no one to mess with . Go back to Patty . " " I 'm trying , " Cobb growled . " But she 's being stubborn . She says I take her for granted or something . " Gramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cocked his head at the young man . " Maybe you should spend more money on your house than you do your boat , boy . Homes are important to women . " He puffed up his chest . " I 've kept the same missus and the same boat for near forty-six years , ' cause I spent my earnings on whichever one was complaining the loudest at the time . " " Maybe I 'll do that , " Cobb said , urging the old man toward land . " And you should get home before Mildred locks you out . " That said , Cobb jogged back to his boat , untied the ropes with quick efficiency , jumped onto the deck , and had the engine started before Gramps even got moving . Duncan gritted his teeth in frustration , inching around the crates as the old sea salt finally walked by muttering something about the foolishness of horny toads . By the time Duncan was able to move down the pier , Cobb 's boat was already disappearing into the fog  --  and Willow Foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
