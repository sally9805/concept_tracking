Feed By M.T . Anderson Candlewick M.T . Anderson It was maybe , okay , maybe it was like two days after the party with the " never pukes when he chugalugs " that Violet chatted me first thing in the morning and said she was working on a brand-new project . I asked her what was the old project , and she was like , did I want to see the new one ? I said , Okay , should I come over to su casa ? I 've never been there , and she was like , No , not yet . Let 's meet at the mall . I was like , Okay , sure , fine , whatever swings your string , and she was all , Babycakes , you swing my string , which is a nice thing for someone to say to you , especially before you use mouthwash . So I flew over to the mall near her house through the rain , which was coming down outside in this really hard way . Everyone had on all their lights until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny , and people were flying very businesslike . The mall was really busy , there were a lot of crowds there . They were buying all this stuff , like the inflatable houses for their kids , and the dog massagers , and the tooth extensions that people were wearing , the white ones which you slid over your real teeth and they made your mouth just like one big single tooth going all the way across . Violet was standing near the fountain and she had a real low shirt on , to show off her lesion , because the stars of the Oh ? Wow ! Thing ! had started to get lesions , so now people were thinking better about lesions , and lesions even looked kind of cool . Violet looked great in her low shirt , and besides that she was smiling , and really excited for her idea . For a second we said hello and just laughed about all of the stupid things people were buying and then Violet , she pointed out that , regarding legs to stand on , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeling around a wheelbarrow full of a giant hot cross bun from Bun in a Barrow . I said , " Yum , yum , yum . " She was like , " You ready ? " I asked her what the idea was . She said , " Look around you . " I did . It was the mall . She said , " Listen to me . " I listened . She said , " I was sitting at the feed doctor 's a few days ago , and I started to think about things . Okay . All right . Everything we do gets thrown into a big calculation . Like they 're watching us right now . They can tell where you 're looking . They want to know what you want . " " It 's a mall , " I said . " They 're also waiting to make you want things . Everything we 've grown up with - the stories on the feed , the games , all of that - it 's all streamlining our personalities so we 're easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies that divide everyone up into a few personality types , and then you get ads based on what you 're supposedly like . They try to figure out who you are , and to make you conform to one of their types for easy marketing . It 's like a spiral : They keep making everything more basic so it will appeal to everyone . And gradually , everyone gets used to everything being basic , so we get less and less varied as people , more simple . So the corps make everything even simpler . And it goes on and on . " This was the kind of thing people talked about a lot , like , parents were going on about how toys were stupid now , when they used to be good , and how everything on the feed had its price , and okay , it might be true , but it 's also boring , so I was like , " Yeah . Okay . That 's the feed . So what ? " " This is my project . " " Is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the collar of my shirt . " Listen , " she said . " What I 'm doing , what I 've been doing over the feed for the last two days , is trying to create a customer profile that 's so screwed , no one can market to it . I 'm not going to let them catalog me . I 'm going to become invisible . " I stared at her for a minute . She ran her finger along the edge of my collar , so her nail touched the skin of my throat . I waited for an explanation . She did n't tell me any more , but she said to come with her , and she grabbed one of the nodules on my shirt - it was one of those nodule shirts - and she led me toward Bebrekker &; Karl . We went into the store , and immediately our feeds were all completely Bebrekker &; Karl . We were bannered with all this crazy high-tech fun stuff they sold there . Then a guy walked up to us and said could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Violet was like , " Sure . Do you have those big searchlights ? I mean , the really strong ones ? " " Yeah , " he said . " We have . . . yeah . We have those . " He went over to some rack , and he took these big searchlights off the rack . He showed us some different models . The feeds had specs . They showed us the specs while he talked . When he went into the back to get another , cheaper searchlight , I said to Violet , " What next ? " She whispered , " Complicating . Resisting . " Bebrekker &; Karl were bannering us big . It was , We 've streamlined the Tesla coil for personal use - you can even wear it in your hair ! With these new , da da da , and Relax , yawn , and slump ! While our greased cybermassage beads travel up and down your back ! Guaranteed to make you etc. , like that . I was like , " Okay , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searchlight . He told us , " You can see shit real good with this one ? I have one of these on my upcar . It 's sometimes like - whoa , really - whoa . There was this one time ? And I was flying along at night and I shined the light down at the ground , to look at the tops of all the suburb pods ? And all over the top of them , it looked like it was moving , like there was a black goo ? So I turned up the brightness , and I went down , and I shined it more bright , and it turned out the black moving goo was all these hordes of cockroaches . There were miles of them , running all over the tops of the domes . . . . Continues ... by M.T . Anderson
