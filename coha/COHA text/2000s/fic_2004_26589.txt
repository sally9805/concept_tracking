The Faith of a Writer Life , Craft , Art Chapter One As a child I took for granted what seems wonderful to me now : that , from first through fifth grades , during the years 19431948 , I attended the same single-room schoolhouse in western New York that my mother , Carolina Bush , had attended twenty years before . Apart from the introduction of electricity in the early 1940s , and a few minor improvements , not including indoor plumbing , the school had scarcely changed in the intervening years . It was a roughhewn , weatherworn , uninsulated woodframe building on a crude stone foundation , built around the turn of the century near the crossroads community of Millersport , twenty-five miles north of Buffalo and seven miles south of Lockport . I loved my first school !  --  so I have often said , and possibly this is true . In late August , in anticipation of school beginning immediately after Labor Day in September , I would walk the approximate mile from our house , carrying my new pencil box and lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the school building . Just to sit there , dreamy in anticipation of school starting ; possibly to enjoy the solitude and quiet , which would not prevail once school started . ( Perhaps no one recalls pencil boxes ? They were of about the size of a lunch pail , with several drawers that , slid out , revealed freshly sharpened yellow " lead " pencils , Crayola crayons , erasers , compasses . Lunch pails , which perhaps no one recalls either , were of about the size of pencil boxes but , unlike pencil boxes , which smelled wonderfully of Crayolas , lunch pails quickly came to smell awfully of milk in Thermos bottles , overripe bananas , baloney sandwiches , and waxed paper . ) The school , more deeply imprinted in my memory than my own child-face , was set approximately thirty feet back from a pebble-strewn unpaved road , Tonawanda Creek Road ; it had six tall , narrow windows in its side walls , and very small windows in its front wall ; a steeply slanting shingleboard roof that often leaked in heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front called the " entry " ; nothing so romantic as a cupola with a bell to be rung , to summon pupils inside . ( Our teacher Mrs. Dietz , standing Amazon-like in the entry doorway , rang a hand bell . This was a sign of her adult authority , the jarring noise of the bell , the thrusting , hacking gesture of her muscled right arm as she vigorously shook it . ) Behind the school , down a slope of briars and jungle-like vegetation , was the " crick "  --  the wide , often muddy , fast-moving Tonawanda Creek , where pupils were forbidden to play or explore ; on both sides of the school were vacant , overgrown fields ; " out back " were crudely built wooden outhouses , the boys ' to the left and the girls ' to the right , with drainage , raw sewage , virulently fetid in warm weather , seeping out into the creek . ( Elsewhere , off the creek bank , children , mostly older boys , swam . There was not much consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less fastidiousness on the part of energetic farm boys . ) At the front of the school , and to the sides , was an improvised playground of sorts , where we played such improvised games as " May I ? "  --  which involved " baby  --  " and " giant-steps "  --  and " Pom-Pom-Pullaway " which was more raucous , and rougher , where one might be dragged across an expanse of cinders , even thrown down into the cinders . And there was " Tag " which was my favorite game , at which I excelled since I could run , even at a young age , out of necessity , fast . Joyce runs like a deer ! certain of the boys , chasing me , as they chased other younger children , to bully and terrorize us , and for fun , would say , admiring . Inside , the school smelled smartly of varnish and wood smoke from the potbellied stove . On gloomy days , not unknown in upstate New York in this region south of Lake Ontario and east of Lake Erie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much reinforced by ceiling lights . We squinted at the blackboard , that seemed far away since it was on a small platform , where Mrs. Dietz 's desk was also positioned , at the front , left of the room . We sat in rows of seats , smallest at the front , largest at the rear , attached at their bases by metal runners , like a toboggan ; the wood of these desks seemed beautiful to me , smooth and of the red-burnished hue of horse chestnuts . The floor was bare wooden planks . An American flag hung limply at the far left of the blackboard and above the blackboard , running across the front of the room , designed to draw our eyes to it avidly , worshipfully , were paper squares showing that beautifully shaped script known as Parker Penmanship . Mrs. Dietz , of course , had mastered the art of penmanship . She wrote our vocabulary and spelling lists on the blackboard , and we learned to imitate her . We learned to " diagram " sentences with the solemn precision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading aloud , and we learned to spell by spelling aloud . We memorized , and we recited . Our textbooks were rarely new , but belonged to the school district and were passed on , year after year until they wore out entirely . Our " library " was a shelf or two of books including a Webster 's dictionary , which fascinated me : a book containing words ! A treasure of secrets this seemed to me , available to anyone who cared to look into it . My earliest reading experiences , in fact , were in this dictionary . We had no dictionary at home until , winner of a spelling bee sponsored by the Buffalo Evening News , when I was in fifth grade , I was given a dictionary like the one at school . This , like the prized Alice books , remained with me for decades . My early " creative " experiences evolved not from printed books , but from coloring books , predating my ability to read . I did not learn to read until I was in first grade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already produced numerous " books " of a kind by drawing ... The Faith of a Writer
