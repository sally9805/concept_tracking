<p> Midsummer Saturday nights used to be big times for the little stock car tracks across America . But the sport of short track auto racing is in a serious decline . <p> Officials fear that an industry that has provided an integral slice of rural Americana might be headed the way of drive-in theaters and old-fashioned family reunions . <p> The signs of troubling times are hard to miss : <p> * Veteran promoter Charlie Edwards , who has made a career of resurrecting short-track operations , took a non-scheduled midseason break at Senoia Speedway this summer after car and crowd counts dwindled in the first three weeks of operation . He 's making another attempt . <p> * Seven Flags Speedway in Douglasville , a fixture on the local dirt-track scene since the 1960s , was bulldozed three summers ago to make way for residential development . <p> * Montgomery Motor Speedway in Alabama , one of the finest short track facilities anywhere , was closed earlier this year and turned into a storage facility for new Hyundai cars . <p> * Highway 106 Racing Complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are idle this summer . <p> * Lanier National Speedway in Braselton , generally regarded as one of the nation 's premier short tracks , has had to resort to creative marketing approaches to keep attendance steady . Several weeks ago , the track brought in the actor who played Rosco P. Coltrane on the " Dukes of Hazzard " television show to produce one of the season 's top crowds . <p> " The decline in attendance , in general , has been going on at least 10 or 12 years , because there are so many things that people can do with their entertainment dollar , " said Ernie Saxton of Langhorne , Pa. , a participant in the sport for more than 50 years and the publisher of Ernie Saxton 's Motorsports Sponsorship Marketing News , a widely read industry newsletter . <p> " But I 've noticed a significant decline in the last couple of years . It 's been maybe a few percentage points each year before , but in the last couple of years , 10 to 15 percent a year . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for promoters each year , said there are two reasons short tracks are struggling : NASCAR delivered a major blow when it began televising several Nextel Cup , Busch and Craftsman Truck races on Saturday nights . And promoters are n't working as hard as they once did . <p> " The NASCAR TV package gives people an excuse to stay home in their air-conditioned home and sit in their big easy chair and watch it on color TV , " Saxton said . " The concession prices are a lot cheaper , and they do n't have to get involved in traffic . " <p> It was precisely those " couch potatoes " that Lanier promoter Donnie Clack was hoping to attract when he brought in actor James Best , who played Sheriff Coltrane , as a special Saturday night treat for his fans . He said it takes something like that to get fans in the stands . <p> " Strictly good racing is not enough to make fans want to come out , " Clack said . " It takes something out of the ordinary . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his career working with NASCAR-sanctioned short tracks , said short tracks are lucky to draw 800 to 1,000 fans each week . <p> " Ten years ago the number was two times that ... or more , " he said , adding that some tracks , including Dixie Speedway in Woodstock and Bowman-Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem , N.C. , continue to do quite well . <p> Track vice president Mike Swims said Dixie Speedway and its sister track , Rome Speedway , had record back-to-back crowds for the July 4 weekend races . But many operations are trying to survive with 400 fans in facilities designed for 2,500 or more . Ticket prices normally range from $10 to $12 . <p> Clack and Edwards said it also has become tough to get drivers to run on the 1/4-mile to 1/2-mile tracks , mainly because of expenses . <p> " It just does n't seem like racers are as dedicated to racing anymore , " Edwards said . " That leaves the track promoter in a position where it 's hard to figure out what to do . " <p> Clack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were down 20 percent last year but have rebounded some . He said he is worried that the ritual of attending Saturday night races is becoming a thing of the past . <p> " People are not into being dedicated to anything on a regular basis anymore , " he said . " Kids who are growing up on video games do n't like to get out in the yards . People do n't like to get out of the air-conditioning . They do n't like the down-to-earth basic stuff anymore on a regular basis . <p> " Every now and then , you can pack a place out , but not on a regular basis . They can go to the lake , to the movies , to a ball game . It 's hard for us to put our fingers on it . " <p> Saxton , the industry expert , said drivers and promoters are caught in an expensive , destructive swirl . <p> " They 're buying $40,000 motors and $60,000 race cars and racing for $1,500 to win , " he said . " It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing , and it has become very difficult for the promoters to foot the bill for the purses that are required to get the guys to come out and race . They 've actually painted themselves into a corner . " <p> Feeder system no more <p> At one time , the impact on NASCAR would have been dramatic . Most of the older Nextel Cup drivers honed their skills on short tracks in the South before moving to the sport 's top circuit . Today , many drivers are programmed by their parents as soon as they are old enough to reach go-kart pedals . <p> Current Nextel Cup stars Carl Edwards and Denny Hamlin advanced from traditional Saturday night tracks , but many of NASCAR 's younger drivers have come from open wheel and off-road . <p> " If it continues like it is ... the feeder system will not exist , " Saxton said . " You 'll be seeing more of teams going to drivers from other forms of racing . " <p> Hunter understands the potential ramifications , but said NASCAR has not created the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for drivers and the failure of promoters to modernize facilities . He said NASCAR 's TV package has nothing to do with it . <p> " That 's not a reason ; that 's an excuse , " Hunter said . <p> Veteran driver Lee Hansard of Tyrone said drivers and promoters need to regroup and get back to an old-school approach . <p> " I can still go race the way I used to , and if promoters would still promote the way they used to , maybe it would still work , " Hansard said , explaining that he believes it 's possible to race competitively without buying all of the latest high-tech gadgets . <p> Edwards , who reopened his track Saturday night in an effort to jump-start his weekly program , has tried to cut costs for racers by amending his rules to make " crate " engines competitive . <p> Crate engines ( they are packed in crates ) are available from General Motors for approximately $6,000 , compared to $30,000 to $50,000 for a specially built racing engine . <p> Like drive-in movies <p> Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rebuild their businesses , but one major question lingers . <p> " I do n't know if we 're a dying sport , " Edwards answers . <p> But everyone agrees the industry is shrinking . <p> " In time , the strong will survive , but the mom-and-pop operations that have been the backbone of this sport for many years will fall by the wayside , " Saxton said , adding that the surviving tracks will be those that emphasize marketing and public relations and are structured like major speedways . <p> Clack predicts that only 50 to 60 percent of Georgia 's 25 short tracks will exist in 10 years . He said lucrative offers from real estate developers will be too tempting for struggling track owners . <p> " When a promoter 's out there every Saturday night beating his brains against the wall trying to figure out how to get people in there , and then some high-dollar developer comes in there with more money than he knows what to do with , he has n't got any choice but to sell it , " Clack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lost forever because local governments and neighborhood groups would n't allow construction of a new facility . <p> " I think you could build a nuclear plant easier than you could build a short track in most areas , " Saxton said . <p> Clack , tongue-in-cheek , suggested another approach . <p> " It would take a fool to go build a new race track in an industry that 's struggling like it is , " he said . " You may as well go build you a new drive-in movie theater .
