" Great speaker last night , right ? " Vince Flockhart , Fenimore 's principal , looked hopefully down at Anne Ehrlich , head of guidance , as she ate her grilled cheese sandwich in the faculty cafeteria . Report had it that the parents had been impressed by the speaker -- though half had left in tears and the other half had been digging in the bottom of their bags for Valium . " He was very high energy , " conceded Anne . " You did n't like him ! " declared Vince , peering more closely at Anne 's face . He liked to look at that face -- it had a sweetness and unconventional beauty that was undeniably appealing -- but he was also attuned to its judgment , which he had learned to ignore at his peril . " My only concern , " acknowledged Anne carefully , " is that he may have upset some of our more high-strung parents . " Vince swallowed queasily . The idea of Fenimore parents , jumpy under normal circumstances , whipped into a frenzy by the speaker made him reach in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Anne reassured him , " I 'm sure they 'll be no worse than usual . " ( This , admittedly , was small consolation --  " usual " for Fenimore parents was very bad . ) " Besides , we just have to get through the next few months . It 's downhill after that . " Her tone was encouraging , but she was not without her own sense of dread . If Vince as principal was the last line of defense against Fenimore parents , Anne as head of guidance was the first . Soon , anxious parents would be dropping by her office to ask whether to capitalize the S in " Secretary of the French Club " and whether to use Times Roman or Courier font on their kids ' college applications . Soon , she would be witness topitched battles between kids and their parents that went well beyond the scope of the curriculum ( " Maybe if you and Dad had worked harder at staying married , I 'd have worked harder at honors chem ! " ) . Last year , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of the fathers , an expert in international law , had confided that he had n't been so tense since he drew a low draft number during Vietnam . Applying to college was a big deal in Westchester County , as it was throughout much of the country . This was due , in part , to the prestige that certain colleges were assumed to confer -- the decal on the car functioning in the manner of a designer logo and marking the kid as a high-end accessory . This was also due to the insecurity of parents , who sensed that their children were unformed artifacts at eighteen and were hoping that an excellent college would hand them a finished product . ( What a finished product was supposed look like , of course , was open to question -- although the next Steven Spielberg or Bill Gates , with a burning desire to live next door to their parents in Westchester , would n't be so bad . ) Fortunately , as Anne reminded Vince , the most stressful period occurred during the first few months of the school year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ) applied for early admission . Once that notification had been made by mid-December , things grew relatively calm until the final decisions for regular applicants arrived in April . By then , changes in the angle of light , not to mention the approach of summer vacation , moderated the tendency to hysteria . Vince , however , did not seem comforted by the reminder that he had only three months of pure hell ahead of him . He heaved a sigh , popped the antacid into his mouth , and lumbered off . After he left , Marcy Fineman , who taught history at Fenimore and was sitting across from Anne , looked up from scraping the mayonnaise off the top slice of her turkey sandwich . " Was he cute ? " she asked . " Was who cute ? " responded Anne , confused . " The speaker last night . The one Vince just mentioned . Did he have potential ? " Marcy had a way of lagging behind in conversation , her mind distracted by what she was n't going to eat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five ! " " And what 's wrong with twenty-five ? You 're only thirty-four . You see thirty-four-year-old women marrying twenty-five-year old-men all the time in The New York Times wedding section . " " Really ? " Anne looked unconvinced . She knew that , as a historian , Marcy felt obliged to cite evidence for her assertions , but since she often asserted what she wished to be true rather than what actually was , her evidence tended to be fabricated . " The point is , " continued Marcy , disregarding Anne 's question , " age should n't be an issue . You know you do n't look a day over twenty-five . I read in Cosmo that most women do n't start to age until their late thirties . " Anne looked doubtful again , but Marcy continued unfazed . " All I 'm saying is that you should n't rule people out . It 's not that you do n't attract men -- I mean , they 're always looking at you . But you do n't encourage them . You ca n't know if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I give people a chance , " said Anne , " within reason . " " But your idea of reason is n't reasonable . Personally , I think you 're too picky . " Marcy paused here to wipe the mayonnaise off the lettuce in her sandwich with her napkin , then continued : " You 've met some nice enough guys , but they 're never good enough . There was Chris who had that great car and Steven who sent you flowers . " " Steven was sweet , " Anne admitted . " He cooked you dinner . He served you breakfast in bed . He fixed your computer . For God 's sake , what did you want ? " " He did n't like to read , " noted Anne . " So he was n't into books . Big deal . " " Marcy , how can you say that ? You 're a history teacher . " " Yes , well , I happen to like to read . But I would n't judge someone else for not liking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Anne , " not jury selection . Shared interests are important . " Marcy sighed and looked momentarily despondent . " Rich and I used to have lots of shared interests . We once read through the Declaration of Independence and pretended we were the Founding Fathers . It was very romantic . " Anne was about to say she was sure they would do such romantic things again -- but Marcy had already plunged ahead : " I think that you 're comparing them all to that first one , what 's his name -- the one you let get away . " Anne was silent for a moment . " Ben Cutler , " she finally said . It was odd how just saying his name could still move her . Marcy was right ; she did , unconsciously , compare every man she met to Ben Cutler . " He was exceptional , " she admitted in the detached tone she tried to adopt on this subject . She liked to think that she had gotten over Ben , though in moments of solitude his memory still haunted her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my family thought he did n't have the right background or enough ambition . Even Winnie was against it . " " Your grandmother is a fabulous woman , " said Marcy , " but she 's a snob . " " Maybe , " Anne said quietly . " But I think she 's mellowed and would see things differently now . Not that it matters . Ben Cutler is rich and successful and proved us all wrong with a vengeance . " " You 're in touch with him ? " " No . " " You Googled him ? " " Is there anyone we have n't Googled ? " Marcy agreed . " Yesterday I Googled some kid who picked his nose behind me in the fifth grade . He owns a chain of optical shops in New Jersey . So your guy , Cutler , what does he do now ? " " He writes those travel books , Cutler 's Guides to Culture . Sort of a high-end version of Frommer 's . They 're very popular . " " No kidding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used Cutler 's Guide to Sicily on our honeymoon . It had a great section on Godfather shooting sites and the best places for canneloni -- not that I ate any , but it was nice to know . " She drifted for a moment . " Rich and I have n't gone anywhere since that trip . They say that you ca n't really take time off at a top law firm until your first heart attack . " " Marcy ! " exclaimed Anne , but Marcy waved her hand . " So did you contact him ? Did you write this travel mogul Ben Cutler ? " Anne shook her head . " I could never contact him now . He 's probably married with kids -- and it would seem like I was only interested because he 's successful and I'm -- well , you know --  " " And how is that situation ? " " The same , " Anne said wearily . If anything , she thought to herself , things were worse . Her father had just bought a new cashmere sports jacket -- she had found the bill for it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . The only consolation was that if you were already over a million in debt , a thousand more or less hardly mattered . As her mind pondered the " situation , " as Marcy put it , a small line formed over Anne 's forehead , giving her gentle face a touch of severity . Countless Fenimore boys , summoned to the guidance office for the conventional misdemeanor , had kept to the straight and narrow in order to avoid seeing that line form again over Anne Ehrlich 's forehead . " We 're going to have to sell the Scarsdale house , " she explained to Marcy now . " I hate to do it ; I grew up there and Winnie 's lived there for so long , but I do n't see another option . " " What does your father say ? " " Not much . You know my dad ... " Marcy rolled her eyes to indicate that she did . " But it 's Winnie I 'm worried about . I have n't told her yet , and I really do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ask me , now 's the time to give Harry Furman a chance , " said Marcy , returning to the subject of Anne 's love life . Harry Furman was a partner in Marcy 's husband 's law firm , who she 'd been pushing Anne to go out with for weeks . " Harry 's rich . He has a duplex on Park Avenue . I 'm sure he 'd love a weekend home in Westchester . So what if he 's been married before ? " " He 's been married twice before . " " OK , twice . Glamour magazine says twice-divorced men make great husbands ; they do n't want to strike out . So he 's not perfect . I 'm sure that this Cutler fellow was n't perfect either . They 're never as good as you think they are . " Anne let herself consider this . Had she idealized Ben Cutler ? It was possible , given the time that had elapsed -- thirteen years , after all . And even if he had been as good then , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had contributed to making him different : less trusting and less kind . It would be natural for such a thing to happen . Marcy was about to expound on the advantages of Harry Furman 's twice-married state and duplex on Park Avenue , when Anne interrupted . " I have to go , " she said abruptly . They were over the half hour she usually took for lunch , and the mention of Ben Cutler had unnerved her , making her eager to get back to work . " I 'm up to my neck in early admissions letters , and the Hopgoods have a one-fifteen that 's probably going to take up the rest of the afternoon . Mr. Hopgood asked me to prepare a full strategic plan for getting Trevor into Williams . When I told him I could n't do that , he said they were going to hire their own Ivy packager . " " Ivy packager ? " " It 's our guidance lingo for a college consultant . Like the speaker last night . He charges two hundred fifty dollars an hour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parents hire people to sell their children ? " " Absolutely . They do it for toothpaste , toilet paper , and deodorant , so why not your standard-issue teenager ? " " I must have missed that one , " noted Marcy , who admittedly missed a lot , since her mind , when not teaching the Louisiana Purchase , tended to be occupied with whether to have lo-cal Italian or lo-cal French dressing on her salad that day . " But come to think of it , I did have a weird thing happen with a reference letter last week . " She paused , taking a sip from her unsweetened iced tea . " Tim Dougherty , one of the seniors in my second-period American history class , asked if I was ' into letter writing . ' That 's how he put it . Then , his mother called to ask what my ' philosophy ' on reference letters was . I did n't know that I had to have a philosophy . " " They just want to know if you 're trustworthy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then go ahead and screw the kid in the reference letter . " " How awful ! " said Marcy . " Are there really teachers who do that ? " " Of course , screwing is a matter of perspective . Nowadays , saying that a student is diligent and nice can be the kiss of death for admission to a good school . " " What 's wrong with ' diligent and nice ? ' " asked Marcy , looking worried -- she had used more or less these words in her reference letter for Tim Dougherty . " You might as well say the kid is an unassuming clod who 'll add nothing to the vibrant atmosphere of the college . You have to say he 's of exceptional caliber -- the best you ever had , or at least the best in some particular area ; it does n't matter what . A good packager can turn ' the best at being rude and disruptive ' into ' a fiercely independent spirit . ' " " Thanks for the clarification . " Marcy sighed . She wondered if she should send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best she 'd ever had in the production of flatulence during a fifty-minute period . No other exceptional quality came to mind . " It 's ridiculous how competitive things have gotten , " admitted Anne , " which explains why the parents are going nuts . They want their kids to have everything for a happy , successful life , and a good college seems to be part of the equation . God knows , I 'd probably be buying the prep books and hiring the tutors if I had kids of my own , " she noted wistfully . " Well , thank God , Rich and I do n't , " declared Marcy . She and her husband had made the decision not to have children , owing , in part , to a desire to remain in Manhattan ( a relative impossibility once the financial albatross of a child entered the picture ) , and because the prospective weight gain associated with pregnancy had a way of making Marcy hyperventilate . " I 've got the kids in my classes , " she rationalized , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , thank God , I do n't have to see after three P.M. I suppose I 'll be losing out on those lifetime events like the bar mitzvah and the wedding -- but I do n't think I 'd be very good with the caterer anyway . " Anne said nothing . She secretly believed that Marcy would make an excellent mother -- if only she could get herself to eat a doughnut.
