Chocolate sales rise every February as romantics search for the perfect confection to express their feelings . But this year the message may contain a bit more bite , now that chocolatiers are creating treats that are more savory than sweet . Vosges Haut-Chocolate is offering truffles filled with Taleggio cheese or topped with dried olives . Chefs are also using cocoa in dishes that come before dessert . F.
