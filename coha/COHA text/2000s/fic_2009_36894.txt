PALM SPRINGS , CALIFORNIA <p> The first time I saw him , he was nothing more than a face and a pair of hands . Not once did his eyes meet mine . Even as he took my order , his chin was already lifting to greet the man behind me . The first time I saw him , he did not see me . <p> It was a green night . The mountains were gray and the sand blowing in from the desert was yellow , but the night itself was so green , it was almost emerald . A mirage , I knew . A trick of the setting sun . On a green night , nothing was what it seemed . <p> " Do you know who he is ? " I asked my friend Randall , my eyes fixed on the bartender . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Him . " <p> Randall shook his head . " Never seen him before . " <p> " He 's beautiful . " <p> " You think ? " <p> With much reluctance did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A green cast was coloring his face as the last slanting rays of the sun reflected against the mountains . Night was rushing in to fill up every corner of the bar 's outdoor deck , and the busboys were busy lighting the lanterns that hung over our heads . Little flames leapt and hopped as if they were living , breathing creatures , and I was reminded , yet again , of the night my sister disappeared twenty-seven years before , the night when everything in my world changed , the night I came to understand that I would never grow up to be the man I had expected to be . <p> " He is beautiful , Randall , " I said , with conviction . " Absolutely beautiful . " <p> " Danny , " my friend replied , " I did not come out with you tonight to moon over beautiful bartenders . " He glowered at me , his face pinched and unhappy , as if he 'd just bitten into a lemon . <p> I gave him a small smile . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk about Ike . Go ahead . I 'm listening . " <p> He looked aghast . " I do not want to talk about Ike . " <p> " Okay , then , let 's not talk about him . " <p> Randall huffed . " Why would I drive all the way out here to the desert if I wanted to ruin your birthday by talking about Ike ? " <p> I managed a small smile . " It would n't ruin my birthday , Randall . " <p> He pouted . " Of course , it would . It ruined my entire life . " He raised his martini to me . " Happy birthday , Danny . " <p> I raised mine to him . " Thank you , Randall . " <p> My birthday . Ever since my teens , the day had felt awkward and peculiar , even inappropriate , fraught with memories tattered and terrible but sometimes freakishly funny as well . After the age of fourteen-the age I turned on the day my sister disappeared-all birthday parties ceased in my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought it unfair . Not until I was twenty did I have another birthday party-given to me , in fact , by Randall , soon after I 'd arrived in California . It felt odd , all that singing and merrymaking , not to mention the sex that went on after the party . I felt as if I was being unfaithful-not to my sister , not to my parents , but to me , to the boy I 'd left behind in Connecticut . The boy who had done everything he could but still had ultimately failed . <p> " Talk to me , " I said to Randall . " Talk to me about Ike . " <p> He frowned . " It 's your birthday , Danny . We 're out to have fun tonight . It 's not often you and I get a chance to go out on our own . Usually , there 's Frank with us and- " <p> " And Ike , " I finished . <p> " And Ike . " Randall let out a long , dramatic sigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more . " <p> We were never a happy little foursome , but I did n't say that to Randall . Neither Frank nor I had ever cared all that much for Ike . I did n't say that , either . What I did do was glance back at the bar . I could n't see the bartender anymore . It was too dark now . Besides , too many men had crowded around his station . <p> " Did I tell you he wants to take the dog ? " Randall asked . <p> I returned my eyes to Randall 's face . " You never liked that dog . " <p> " Still , we got it together . I paid for its shots . " <p> " Now you 're being petty , Randall . " <p> " Well , what 's wrong with being petty ? He 's the one who fell in love with someone else . Someone younger , someone more attractive . Now that 's being petty . " <p> No , not petty . Cruel . Heartless . Inconvenient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty . Yet none of it did I say to Randall . <p> Instead , I looked again for the bartender and spotted his face emerging for a moment from the crowd . " How can you say he 's not beautiful ? " I asked despite myself . <p> Randall snorted . " Please . They 're a dime a dozen , those bartenders . He probably has a crystal meth habit . " He took another sip of his martini . " Well , what are you doing standing here if he fascinates you so much ? Are n't you going to introduce yourself ? " <p> " Maybe . " <p> Randall leaned in for the kill . " Make sure you tell him you 're married . You know how pissed these boys get when you fail to mention that little detail . " <p> Instinctively , my thumb moved inside my palm to feel the titanium band around my left ring finger . Married . Yes , I supposed I was , even if California had yet to consider what Frank and I had done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway-especially here , on this green night in the middle of the desert ? What did it mean after twenty years-the last four of which had been a string of silent nights , the only sound the tapping of our computer keys , our faces bathed in the blue light of our monitors , each of us waiting for the other to call it a night so that the last one of us awake might be free to jack off , to find some fleeting , puny satisfaction with the boys of online porn ? <p> I looked back over at the bar . All I could see was the top of his head . His thick , dark hair , the sharply cut sideburns . How very much I wanted to see his eyes . <p> " I know what you 're thinking , " Randall said . " I should have de- fined my relationship with Ike the way you 've defined yours with Frank . You ca n't lose someone if that 's simply not part of the playbook . That 's why you and Frank have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 've come between you . " He knocked back the last of his martini . " How very nice for you . " <p> I smiled , eyes still averted . " Bitter does n't become you , Randall . " <p> " I 'm not bitter . " <p> That was debatable . Randall had always had big dreams , though they were n't anything like my big dreams . My dreams had always been about success ; Randall 's were about contentment . Once , just starting out in med school , he 'd imagined he 'd be a great surgeon ; he 'd ended up as a kids ' orthodontist in Century City . Once , when we were young , he 'd dreamed of finding a husband with whom he 'd grow old . But the only thing that had happened was that Randall himself had grown old . <p> " I could never have been like you and Frank , " he was saying , shaking his head , as if he were reading my mind . " I could never have let Ike sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once , I had been in love with Randall . We had both been twenty years old-slightly more than half our current ages . We 'd been living in West Hollywood , in those exciting months when it first broke away from Los Angeles to become its own city-the first gay city in the world , we liked to say . It was difficult for me to remember the way Randall had looked back then . The eyes were the same , round like buttons and as blue as an August sky . But the glorious black hair had receded over the passing years , and the belly , once trim , had grown thick . I tried to picture him as he was , but I could n't . <p> Not that it surprised me . So little of my months in California before Frank remained in my memory . All I could remember now with any real clarity were the Big Weenie hot-dog stands ( BIG WEENIES TASTE BETTER ) and the NO FAGS sign posted at Barney 's Beanery . And the clubs . I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of piss and beer , the silver strobe lights , the music ( Duran Duran , Cyndi Lauper , Yes ) . I think my strongest memory of those days was doing lines of coke behind the bar as " Owner of a Lonely Heart " played on the sound system . <p> But not much else remained in my brain from the time before Frank . I 'd been a scared , insecure kid just off the bus . I 'd lived with Randall in an apartment near Fairfax . I remembered a claw-foot bathtub , a ratty old couch , VHS tapes stacked against the wall almost to the ceiling . There 'd been sex , a lot of sex , even though the plague was all around us then : sex with Randall , sex with Edgar , sex with Benny , sex with tons of others , usually on my waterbed , which one time sprang a leak . <p> But what could never fade from my memory of that time was the ambition , so tightly wound up inside me that it sometimes woke me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands clenched at my sides , causing me to scream out loud , waking the neighbors . I had traveled all the way across the country on a Peter Pan bus in order to be someone . I had failed back home , failed miserably , and so I had come west , like so many had before me . To be someone . And so I did-I became someone on top of a box in a club on Santa Monica Boulevard , wearing a pair of cowboy boots and a yellow thong , twisting my ass to Boy George and " Karma Chameleon . " <p> Oh , yes . A very long time ago . <p> On nights that were never green . <p> " I thought it would be me who found the lasting relationship , " Randall was saying , his voice low , his words beginning to slur from the vodka . " I thought it would be me who ended up living happily ever after-not you , Danny . You were always so flighty . Always moving from one boy to the next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll find someone , Randall . You 'll forget Ike , and you 'll fall in love again . With someone who is worthy of you this time . Ike never was . " <p> This mellowed him a bit . " I 'm just not sure how many more times I can go through it . " He looked so sad standing there . So sad and so old . " Falling in love is hell , " he said . <p> " You 're crazy . Everyone wants to be in love . " <p> " Oh , sure , in the beginning . " Randall drew up his chin and looked defiantly at me with his blue eyes . " It 's great to be in love in the beginning-when you 're giddy and lovesick , and you think about the person all the time , and he thinks about you . You call each other nine , ten times a day . You wish you could be together all the time . You start to miss him even before you say good night . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . " He paused for dramatic effect . " In the beginning . " <p> I laughed . " What you need is to get laid tonight . " <p> Randall scowled . " Oh , let 's just get out of here and have some dinner . " <p> " I 'm not hungry , " I lied . <p> " Well , we 've got to eat . " <p> " Who says ? " <p> Randall was looking past me , into the crowd . I followed his gaze . A slim , blond young man in blue jeans and a vintage Atari T-shirt . <p> " He 's cute , " I said . <p> Randall 's scowl only deepened . " Well , then it 's your lucky night , Danny , because he 's been looking at you ever since we got here . " <p> " How do you know that ? Maybe he 's been looking at you . " <p> Randall narrowed his eyes at me . " No , Danny . Let me give you a visual . Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of hair . Need I say more ? " <p> " You 're too hard on yourself , Randall . " <p> " He 's just a kid , anyway , " he said , shrugging . " Why would he look at old men like us ? " <p> I laughed . " You forget that in Palm Springs , even turning forty-one still qualifies us as chicken . " I gestured with my drink . " Look around you . " <p> The place was , as usual , packed with fifty- to seventy-somethings . Distinguished-looking men mostly , men who had once been handsome , men who even now retained some awareness of how they should look , even if they were largely held together by buttons and cinched belts and oversize Tommy Bahama floral-print shirts . A noticeable few displayed the plumped lips and shiny foreheads of cosmetic surgery . But the ones who stood out most were the heirs of Liberace , scattered randomly throughout the crowd , wearing red velvet blazers and too much sweet cologne . <p> " Go ahead , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there . " <p> " Oh , please . He wants you , Danny . Do n't you want a birthday fuck ? " <p> I leveled my eyes at him . " For your information , I had already planned on going home to Frank tonight . " <p> " Oh , really ? And will there be a trick waiting to sleep between you ? " <p> " Tonight , my friend , " I told him , " it will be you who goes home with the trick . " <p> I took hold of Randall 's arm and tugged . I owed him this one . <p> " What are you doing ? " he asked , big-eyed . <p> " Come with me . " <p> I led him across the deck . The curly blond in the Atari T-shirt noticed our approach but continued talking with two older men , pretending he had n't . <p> " Hello , " I said to the group . " I hate to interrupt .... " <p> " Well , we 've been hoping you might do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older men . " Or at least , he has . " <p> The man 's eyes twinkled . He wore a black double-breasted blazer with a pink silk pocket puff . I assumed the " he " being referenced was blondie . <p> " Great , " I said . " Because I want to introduce you to my great friend Randall here . Randall Drew , prominent orthodontist of Century City , collector of East Asian artifacts , and all-around good guy , meet ... " I gestured around at the three men . <p> " I 'm Thad Urquhart , " said the man with the pink puff . <p> " Jimmy Carlisle , " said the second older man . <p> Our eyes turned to the young blondie . <p> " Jake Jones , " he said . If his eyes were still on me , I did n't know it . I kept mine elusive . <p> Randall was shaking each of their hands , leaving Jake for last . " I 'm sorry for my bold friend , " he was telling them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all , " said Thad Urquhart , apparently the spokesman for the group . " We enjoy meeting new people , do n't we , Jake ? " <p> Jake did n't reply . And I refused to look at him to see his expression . <p> " But we did n't get your name , " Thad said to me . <p> " Call me Ishmael , " I told them , and before anyone could stop me , I lifted my hand in a gesture of farewell and shouldered my way back into the crowd . <p> Randall was on his own now . <p> And I was on my way back to the bar . Friday night happy hour was always packed , and this night was no exception . A crush of men clustered around the bar , waiting for drinks . It was easy to understand why the line at this station was longer than any of the others . Apparently , much of the crowd agreed with my assessment of the bartender 's beauty . <p> He was young , perhaps very young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones . He moved with a determined concentration , mixing drinks with an intense , uncanny focus . Not once did I see his lips , full and pink , stretch into a smile . From his black tank top protruded lean , muscled arms , their lower halves covered with soft dark fuzz . A cleft indented his chin . His hair , almost black , was artfully messy ; his cheeks were covered with carefully clipped dark whiskers . At the very base of his neck , a small tattoo of an eagle spread its indigo wings . <p> But what I could n't see-and longed for-were his eyes . <p> " Danny Fortunato ? " <p> I turned . A man was approaching me , a short , slight man of maybe fifty-five . A toothy , eager smile seemed to precede him . <p> " You are Danny Fortunato , right ? " <p> " Yes , " I said , studying him . I did n't know his face . <p> " That 's what I thought , " the man was saying , extending his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm staying at one of the resorts in Warm Sands , and the innkeeper told me you often come to happy hour on Fridays . I was hoping I 'd bump into you , and well , here you are . " His smile extended , revealing more teeth . " I 'm a huge fan . " <p> I shook his hand . " Thank you . " <p> " I just saw the cover of Palm Springs Life . " His face was reddening . " I 'm an artist , too , though certainly not of your caliber .... " He was still pumping my hand . " I 'm not anywhere as good as you are . I 've bought several of your prints , in particular the whole series you did for Disneyland . That was amazing ! Hollywood classic ! " <p> " Thank you , " I said again . <p> " Do you still sell your prints in retail ? Or is it all now just by commission ? " <p> I wanted to get away , get to the bar , discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let go of my hand . He was gripping it so hard , I was losing feeling in it . <p> " Mostly commission now , yes , " I told him , hoping the conversation would end there . " Hotel chains and restaurants ... you know , that sort of thing . " <p> " Oh , if only I could ever get to that point , " he said , " when I 'd be well known and well regarded enough to get commissions and just live off those , and not have to crank out so many prints-and you 're so much younger than I am ! " He sighed , drawing in closer . " I do mostly giclTe prints myself . They 're sold in a few galleries in L.A. How did you ever get a commission with Disney ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
