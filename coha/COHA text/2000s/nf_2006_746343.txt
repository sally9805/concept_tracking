Wilbur Zelinsky has spent his spectacular scholarly career enhancing our understanding of American life through explorations into the nation 's cultural geography . Although he has illuminated grand themes , he is also celebrated for his eclectic work on the geography of Americana . Few , however , may appreciate his lifelong enjoyment of American literature . Early in my scholarly journey , Wilbur encouraged my awakening interest in reading widely , beyond the boundaries of professional literature . Conversations with him about shared literary enthusiasms affirmed my reading proclivities . From classic novels to those of minor authors , commentary by journalists , biographies , and mass-market fiction , literature offers provocative insights into American life and landscape . Reading widely takes one in unforeseen professional directions and yields unexpected rewards . Wilbur 's sheer delight with the phenomena of the American scene , however seemingly trivial , instructs us to not overlook their possible geographical significance . <p> Keywords : American literature ; cultural geography ; landscape reading ; sense of place ; United States <p> About twenty-five years ago I received a telephone call from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to the SNACS conference in Louisville , Kentucky . I had not been planning to go to Louisville . In fact , I am not certain that I could have accurately translated the acronym " SNACS " into its full title , the Society for the North American Cultural Survey . However , this was Wilbur Zelinsky at the other end of the telephone communication . . Although I did not know Professor Zelinsky personally , I certainly knew who he was . I was only a handful of years out of graduate school ; he was a recent past president of the Association of American Geographers . His The Cultural Geography of the United States ( 1973a ) sat near at hand on my bookshelf , a staple in my courses . His articles on population geography , American settlement , and the cultural landscape informed my graduate training ( Zelinsky 1994 ) . His essay " In Pursuit of Historical Geography and Other Wild Geese " had stirred controversy , and even some heat , among those of us who identified ourselves as historical geographers ( Zelinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I would be delighted to travel with him ! <p> As I recall , Wilbur swooped down to the University of Pittsburgh in the late afternoon from Pennsylvania State University , nestled snugly in the Allegheny Mountains . To reach Louisville that night , he uncharacteristically stuck to Interstate highways because the distance was long and daylight growing short . The more Wilbur-like peregrination through the countryside on blue highways had to wait for the return journey . At our stop for dinner that evening , I received a quick lesson in being a cultural geographer . We historical geographers out of the University of Wisconsin , from the Andrew Clark and David Ward years , had received training in archival research , not cultural observation . In the restaurant we sat down to table settings with coffee cups turned upside down on their saucers . The waitress approached our table with greetings , menus , and a steaming hot coffeepot . As she parroted the dinner specials , she simultaneously righted the cups and prepared to fill them with coffee . We had not even ordered yet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behavior , he informed me later , signaled that we had entered mid-America . Clearly , I needed to pay closer attention . This weekend 's travel partner had much to teach me , much that was not in archives . <p> Darkness shrouded the landscape for the remainder of the drive to Louisville . With little to see beyond the headlights , conversation came easily and filled the void . We discovered a common interest in reading broadly , beyond the boundaries of professional literature . Wilbur 's unbridled delight in authors such as H. L. Mencken , Wallace Stegner , Hugh MacLennan , or John O'Hara , to name those I had been reading enthusiastically , lit up the interior of the car for me . This eminent geographer shared my enjoyment of reading North American writers of fiction and nonfiction , writers whose work conveyed a sense of place . If Wilbur Zelinsky gained both pleasure and intellectual inspiration from reading nonprofessional literature , then surely my own dabbling was not simply a diversion from professional life . <p> I needed this confirmation . I had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the University of Maryland to the University of Pittsburgh , from a geography department to a history department , and from Washington , D.C. to Pittsburgh with my young family . Although newly tenured and feeling somewhat more professionally secure , I could nonetheless sense my intellectual horizons shifting in ways that were not yet in focus . My leisure reading had provided some insights and materials for courses on North American historical and regional geography , but for the most part I had kept private my excitement about , for example , Mencken 's commentary on the American city or O'Hara 's fictional construction of the anthracite region 's social geography . I had no more idea how the insights of these authors and many others would fit into my new disciplinary pursuits and responsibilities than I had had to date in connecting them with my research and writing in the historical geography of cities . <p> Armed with Wilbur 's tacit affirmation , I continued my wandering through American literature and expanded my forays into biography in the years after that Louisville trip . While Wilbur boldly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausting and eclectic array of topics  --  most recently the attire of the modern Western male ( Zelinsky 2004 )  --  employing wide-ranging fieldwork and often idiosyncratic methodologies , I kept the personal and the professional separate , confining my leisure reading to the privacy and safety of my home , where I could explore with minimal inconvenience the exploits and settings of Venetian commissarios , Edinburgh detectives , or Navajo reservation police , and the lives of twentieth century writers , politicians , architects , and urban planners . <p> Eventually I began to realize that the hours of reading enjoyment were enriching my teaching and scholarship , often in unanticipated ways . The work of many writers , whether acknowledged classics or simply mass-market potboilers , deepened my appreciation of the meanings , workings , and variety of North American landscapes , often in unforgettable phrases and images , and led to discoveries of aspects of America 's geography I had not previously considered . Additionally , the biographies of significant people , particularly of those whose lives overlapped in some manner , revealed the intricacies and implications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional and personal networks , the exercise of power , and even serendipity . Such rewards from leisure reading  --  and from paintings , photographs , or films  --  are not surprising , for , as geographers know , landscape and place are the product of human experience , insights into which come from the full panoply of artistic and intellectual endeavors . The history and geography of the American experience are for me less comprehensible , even less exciting , without the novelists , biographers , journalists , and essayists rounding out the picture , offering their interpretations , and deepening my perspectives . REVEALING THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE <p> My discovery of the professional benefits of leisure reading hardly broke new ground . Some literary critics , historians , and geographers long ago recognized the importance of the landscape and a sense of place in literature . In turn , it is widely acknowledged that the works of writers , as well as movies , sometimes shape the popular images of specific landscapes . Museum curators , scholars , writers , and moviemakers intent on correcting the popular view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's powerful image of the southern antebellum landscape embodied in Gone with the Wind 's fictional plantation , Tara . The list of writers for whom the landscape is central to their work seems endless . The novels of Willa Cather and Ole Rolvaag , for example , foregrounded the beauty , perils , and mysteries of the Great Plains . Conrad Richter immersed his readers in the dark , dense forests that confronted settlers who ventured beyond the Appalachian Mountains . In both his fiction ' and his nonfiction , Wallace Stegner emphasized the aridity , vast distances , and isolation of the mountain West . <p> Some writers have emphasized the impact of the physical environment more than scholars will accept today , but most  --  and the best  --  writers have not limited themselves to simplistic environmental determinism . They have also recognized the critical role of human activities , perceptions , and institutions . Bernard DeVoto , Utah born and frequent commentator on the West , stressed the significance of aridity and violent weather events for understanding western life . When DeVoto was forming his own interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Prescott Webb 's general environmental thesis about settlement west of the 100th meridian ( Webb 1931 ; DeVoto 1934 ) . But DeVoto did not restrict his view to the influence of the physical environment on the West . He developed a number of other themes critical to the area 's predicament , such as its colonial relationship to eastern capital interests , the impact of industrialization , the legacy of powerful myths  --  the cowboy and rugged individualism , for example  --  and its habitual provinciality and defensiveness ( DeVoto 1946 , 1947 ) . <p> Like DeVoto , many writers indicted the American economic system for the West 's problems because it enticed many westerners to overlook the limitations of the physical environment . Based on his personal experiences growing up on the frontier and homesteading in South Dakota , Hamlin Garland stressed the human tragedy that often attended the typically speculative , profit-focused settlement process . He described the excitement and hope of men chasing the midwestern farming frontier being settled under the Homestead Act in the late nineteenth century . He captured the different character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the epoch of the canvas-covered wagon had passed . . Free land was receding at railroad speed , the borderline could be overtaken only by steam " ( 1917,244 ) . In contrast to the frequently romantic portrayals of frontier settlement , the real story , Garland claimed , was not the land rush and subjugation of the plains to the plow . Rather , it was the hardships of life , the never-ending drudgery , speculative risk , and inevitable crop failures , all visible in the dreary human landscape and in the face of his mother , who had aged terribly and rapidly as she followed his father 's frontier dreams . <p> All that day I had studied the land , musing upon its distinctive qualities , and while I acknowledged the natural beauty of it , I revolted from the gracelessness of its human habitations . The lonely box-like farm-houses on the ridges suddenly appeared to me like the dens of wild animals . The lack of color , of charm in the lives of the people anguished me . I wondered why I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm . ( Garland 1917 , 356 ) <p> In a long and prolific career of writing about the West , Wallace Stegner penned informed , poignant , and at times fond descriptions of the western environment ( Benson 1996 ) . Like his friend Bernard DeVoto , he believed the West 's topography and climate were an essential part of what made western life distinctive , but he too located the source of many problems in western attitudes and behavior . In some of his novels and nonfiction accounts , Stegner described the peripatetic life of his family around the West and the hardships his mother and siblings endured . He had his father embody the speculative get-rich-quick attitude common among many Westerners ( Stegner 1943 ) . Stegner characterized his father 's failed , seasonal wheat enterprise on the High Plains near the Saskatchewan-Montana border with an unforgettable metaphor : " It was not a farm , and we were not farmers , but wheat miners " ( 1955 1977 , 280 ) . The mining metaphor succinctly conveys the goals and character of so many late-nineteenth-century agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves few students uncertain of the point . <p> Memorable landscape writing is not confined to the countryside , the frontier , or the West . A rich variety of streetscapes , neighborhoods , and peoples populate writing set in America 's towns and cities . Examples abound , but Sinclair Lewis 's 1920s satirical novels offer some of the best and most well-known landscape descriptions of an era now remote to many readers ( Lingeman 2002 ) . Lewis froze the image , albeit a negative one , of small-town America through the eyes of his heroine , Carol Kennicott , in his enormously popular novel , Main Street . Newly wed and accompanying her husband back to Gopher Prairie , where he practiced medicine , Carol struggled to keep her spirits up when she first encountered her new home town . The reader joins her as she conducts her " private Seeing Main Street tour . She was within ten minutes beholding not only the heart of a place called Gopher Prairie , but ten thousand towns " ( Lewis 1920 , 34 ) . The scene disheartened Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She saw in it the dilemma of the American built environment . <p> It was not only the unsparing unapologetic ugliness and the rigid straightness which overwhelmed her . It was the planlessness , the flimsy temporariness of the buildings , their faded unpleasant colors . The street was cluttered with electric-light poles , telephone poles , gasoline pumps for motor cars , boxes of goods . Each man had built with the most valiant disregard of all the others . Between a large new " block " of two-story brick shops on one side , and the fire-brick Overland garage on the other side , was a one-story cottage turned into a millinery shop . The white temple of the Farmers ' Bank was elbowed back by a grocery of glaring yellow brick . One store-building had a patchy galvanized iron cornice ; the building beside it was crowned with battlements and pyramids of brick capped with blocks of red sandstone . ( Lewis 1920 , 37 ) <p> In this one brief paragraph Lewis condemned America 's worshipping of its core values of individualism and private property rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town is provincial , dull , ugly , and rustic , in contrast to the places of nostalgia , familiarity , and community that many others perceive the American small town to be ( Francaviglia 1996 , 65-67 ) . <p> A few years later Lewis took his readers on a tour of the large American city of the 1920s . This time the real estate broker , Rotarian , and professed local booster George E Babbitt led the virtual field trip , as he drove on a sunny April morning from his suburban home in Floral Heights to his office in downtown Zenith ( Lewis 1922 ) . Who can forget how Lewis 's opening paragraph conveys the signature image of the industrial metropolis , which marked it as an American landscape and starkly distinguished it from earlier urban forms : " The towers of Zenith aspired above the morning mist ; austere towers of steel and cement and limestone , sturdy as cliffs and delicate as silver rods . They were neither citadels nor churches , but frankly and beautifully office-buildings " ( Lewis 1922 , 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as if he were traversing , or forecasting , Ernest Burgess 's concentric zonal model of the city published in 1925 , three years after Lewis 's novel appeared in bookstores ( Burgess 1925 ) . Zenith , Lewis reminds the reader , could be any American city . <p> He admired each district along his familiar route to the office ; the bungalows and shrubs and winding irregular driveways of Floral Heights . The one-story shops on Smith Street , a glare of plate-glass and new yellow brick ; groceries and laundries and drug-stores to supply the more immediate needs of East Side housewives . The market gardens of Dutch Hollow , their shanties patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors . Billboards with crimson goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema films , pipe tobacco , and talcum powder . The old " mansions " along Ninth Street , S. E. , like aged dandies in filthy linen ; wooden castles turned into boarding-houses , with muddy walks and rusty hedges , jostled by fast-intruding garages , cheap apartment-houses , and fruit-stands conducted by bland , sleek Athenians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tall stacks  --  factories producing condensed milk , paper boxes , lighting-fixtures , motor cars . Then the business center , the thickening darting traffic , the crammed trolleys unloading , and high doorways of marble and polished granite . ( Lewis 1922 , 31 ) <p> Lewis 's fellow writer and friend H. L. Mencken also wrote about the American city of the early twentieth century . A celebrated and prolific newspaper columnist , as well as an editor , essayist , and general provocateur , Mencken commented on many aspects of the American scene , always in his distinctive , lively , rambunctious , and irreverent writing style ( Bode 1969 ; Teachout 2002 ) . A confirmed urbanite , he frequently turned his eyes and pen on Baltimore , where he lived all of his life . Despite his unabashed love for his hometown , Mencken rarely missed an opportunity to puncture the overblown rhetoric of local politicians , air the stench of corruption , or ridicule the bombast of self-important boosters . In concocted words like the " booboisie " that encompassed Lewis 's Babbitts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsympathetic rural-dominated state legislators ignored his city 's needs , Mencken captured and skewered quintessential features of urban life in the 1920s ( Mencken 1928a ) . Although Lewis 's " Babbitt " entered the American language , derogatorily meaning " a self-satisfied person who conforms readily to conventional middle-class ideas and ideals , esp . of business and material success " ( J. Stein 1966 , 63 ) , Mencken 's harsher " booboisie , " blending " boob " ( a stupid person ) with " bourgeois " ( characterized by materialistic pursuits ) , was too uncomfortable for most Americans to incorporate into everyday speech . But the images created by Mencken were no less unforgettable or insightful than Lewis 's now-classic satires . <p> Drawing on his years as a reporter and columnist , Mencken observed the idiosyncrasies and changes that were shaping Baltimore in the interwar decades . He relished local characters , such as the courthouse loafers who stood outside for hours exchanging idle chatter and spitting tobacco juice routinely , voluminously , and unhealthily on the sidewalk . In an age when tuberculosis shortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scornful and legislative attention of local councilmen ( Mencken 1900 ) . He railed against change that threatened his sense of the city . Mencken espied and described the process whereby real estate agents purposefully precipitated racial turnover in residential neighborhoods , the process called " blockbusting " years later ( Mencken 1928b ) . Motor-vehicle operators , he sputtered , rudely blocked downtown traffic flow and dangerously diminished street use by pedestrians . Automobiles , he demanded , should be banned from downtown streets and mass transit supported , especially as subways , with greater public funding ( Mencken 1925 , 1931 ) . Mencken correctly identified the brewing contest between streetcars and automobiles , which played out over several subsequent decades . He incorrectly predicted the winner . He did not realize that his fellow Americans would eschew public subsidies for mass transit , gladly flee the crowded and democratic trolleys for the privacy of their cars , and willingly give up the public life of the streets for the convenience of motor vehicles . <p> For Mencken , Baltimore 's culinary delights  --  Maryland crab cakes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block of red-brick row houses , and many other features made his hometown the epitome of a civilized American city . Cleveland , Buffalo , Pittsburgh , Detroit , and the other upstarts of the second Industrial Revolution received Mencken 's sharp disdain . These new , rapidly growing midwestern industrial cities , which were challenging or surpassing Baltimore in population , were nothing more than glorified , overgrown railroad yards . Forced annexations to augment population and prestige , as in Pittsburgh 's swallowing of its cross-river sibling , Allegheny City , in 1907 , he exclaimed , did not instantly translate into a more civilized city ( Mencken 1907 ) . Pittsburgh especially felt the point of his sharp pen ( Muller 1991 ) . In several articles published during the first third of the twentieth century Mencken ridiculed the city 's indigestible food , marrying millionaires , and mammonism . Pittsburgh 's industrialized landscape did not escape the " Sage of Baltimore 's " searing exaggerations that left indelible impressions . Like others before him , Mencken described the Steel City as " filthy " and " black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One expects steel towns to be dirty " ( Mencken 1927 , 187 ) . But his penchant for hyperbole produced images that went far beyond the commonplace . He called Pittsburgh " an ash pile . " In 1909 he derided the environment : " There is good reason to doubt , for example , that pansies would flourish along the Monongahela River particularly within sight , sound or scent of Pittsburg sic . The soil there is of a peculiar quality , being composed of almost equal parts of coal dust , grease and garbage , and is plainly too rich for small plants " ( Mencken 1909 ) . Years later Mencken left little doubt about his feelings for Pittsburgh 's landscape in a famous Baltimore Evening Sun column entitled " The Libido for the Ugly " and subsequently reprinted many times . <p> Here was the very heart of industrial America , the center of its most lucrative and characteristic activity , the boast and pride of the richest and grandest nation ever seen on earth  --  and here was a scene so dreadfully hideous , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man to a macabre and depressing joke . Here was wealth beyond computation , almost beyond imagination  --  and here were human habitations so abominable that they would have disgraced a race of alley cats . . <p> What I allude to is the unbroken and agonizing ugliness , the sheer revolting monstrousness , of every house in sight . . By the hundreds and thousands these abominable houses cover the bare hillsides , like gravestones in some gigantic and decaying cemetery . On their deep sides . they bury themselves swinishly in the mud . Not a fifth of them are perpendicular . They lean this way and that , hanging on to their bases precariously . And one and all they are streaked in grime , with dead and eczematous patches of paint peeping through the streaks . ( 1927,187-189 ) <p> In contrast to Lewis 's satire and Mencken 's trenchant hyperbole , many writers have portrayed cities , often their home cities , in favorable , even endearing , terms that are no less insightful for their positive approach . William Kennedy 's Albany novels provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Americans from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century , Kennedy simultaneously painted a picture of Albany and upstate New York that does not flinch from the violence , vice , and corruption so often endemic to American urban immigrant life ( Van Dover 1991 ; Michener 1998 ) . But the portrait that unfolds over the cycle of the novels also conveys the author 's affection for this urban past , rather than the kind of condemnations prevalent in earlier realist novels of cities ( Seshachari 1997 , 6 , 20 , 30 ) . E. B. White 's ( 1949 ) paean to New York City shortly after World War II serves as another case in point . White compared Manhattan to a poem because <p> A poem compresses much in a small space and adds music , thus heightening its meaning . The city is like poetry ; it compresses all life , all races and breeds , into a small island and adds music and the accompaniment of internal engines . The island of Manhattan is without any doubt the greatest human concentration on earth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whose full meaning will always remain illusive. ( pp. 21-22 ) <p> In only fifty-three pages , White ranged widely around New York City in the kind of prose for which he is famous . He wrote : " It is by all odds the loftiest of cities . It even managed to reach the highest point in the sky at the lowest moment of the depression . . It is to the nation what the white church spire is to the village . the visible symbol of aspiration and faith , the white plume saying that the way is up " ( pp. 22-23 ) . <p> Popular novels written for mass-market entertainment and without pretension as great literature may also provide windows to the workings of cities and their landscapes . Mysteries are my favorite genre for pure late-night entertainment . The best for my tastes incorporate local characters , social divisions , and political insights along with landscapes that are not merely background and place references for the plot but integral to the story . In a mystery series the sense of a particular city unfolds through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of several novels . In recent decades , American mystery novels have shed the Raymond Chandler style of city noir that initially made the genre so popular and branched out to a great variety of protagonists and cities . Laura Lippman 's private investigator , Tess Monaghan , for example , takes the reader through several neighborhoods and suburbs of Baltimore over the course of eight stories , while Sara Paretsky 's V. I. Warshawski roams much of Chicago , particularly the deteriorating industrial , white ethnic communities of the South Side . Walter Mosley 's Easy Rawlins stories describe life for African Americans in post  --  World War II Los Angeles . The streets come alive through the dialogue and action . He links his African American characters and their habitual violence back to the East Texas region from which many emigrated and portrays their economic vulnerability and victimization by public officials , notably at the hands of the Los Angeles police . One can not help but feel the inevitable drift in these stories to the crisis of the Watts riots in 1965 , which Mosley finally addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The most memorable representation of an eastern ethnic neighborhood in recent years comes from a series with no serious literary pretensions . Janet Evanovich has produced twelve slapstick mysteries around the misadventures of Stephanie Plum , a young , inept bounty hunter in Trenton , New Jersey . Formulaic but at times hilarious , the novels will disappear from airport newsstands , paperback new-release tables at megabookstores , and American literature soon after Evanovich tires of the series . However , her portrayal of the mixed , white ethnic Chambersburg neighborhood of Trenton , along with the adjacent commercial streets and other innercity areas of this tired , small eastern industrial city , deserves to last much longer . Evanovich has a keen insider 's eye for the landscape , institutions , and behavior of the people who populate such cities . Exaggerated for comic effect , the food , clothing , hair styles , neighborhood institutions , housing , family and kin relations , and gendered behavior all add up to a compelling portrait of Trenton and the " burg " as the neighborhood is known . Working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community characters as she explores the city 's social crevices in her quest to capture hapless souls and violent criminals who have skipped bail . At times of high stress and low self-image she overdoses on junk food , shops obsessively for shoes , or adorns sleazy clothes and hairdos . Stephanie and the cast of regular characters who appear in each book move routinely about the aging , working-class neighborhood and larger city such that the reader comes to know the places . Evanovich writes that the " burg " comprises narrow houses and narrower minds . For the burg 's older women , most memorably Stephanie 's widowed and liberated grandmother , funeral homes offer a prime social venue because of the propensity for delicious neighborhood gossiping at viewings . For women of all ages beauty parlors are central neighborhood institutions that , in the author 's hands , tie social custom , social philosophy , and social geography together : <p> Bars , funeral homes , bakeries , and beauty parlors form the hub of the wheel that spins the burg . Beauty parlors are especially important because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time warp . The translation of this is that girls in the burg become obsessed with hair at a very early age . The hell with coed peewee football . If you 're a little girl in the burg you spend your time combing out Barbie 's hair . Barbie sets the standard . Big gunky black eyelashes , electric-blue eye shadow , pointy outthrust breasts , and a lot of platinum-blond phony-looking hair . This is what we all aspire to . . Little girls in the burg know better than to get sucked in by yuppie Barbie . <p> The way I see it is , we 're so far behind we 're actually ahead of the rest of the country . We never had to go through any of that messy readjustment with roles stuff . You are who you want to be in the burg . It 's never been men against women . In the burg it 's always been weak against the strong . ( 1996,149 ) <p> Bit by bit over the course of the twelve mysteries , Evanovich tucks within Stephanie 's slapstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspicacious pictures like that of beauty parlors , which together profile the " burg , " a kind of neighborhood common to so many older industrial cities . DISCOVERING REGIONAL SOCIAL GEOGRAPHIES <p> For much of the 1980s Wilbur Zelinsky and I met regularly as part of the editorial team preparing The Atlas of Pennsylvania ( Cuff and others 1989 ) . Wilbur was practically in a state of perpetual giddiness thinking about the cartographic presentation of cultural ephemera . One page on Pennsylvania writers adapted two maps from Matthew J. Bruccoli 's biography of John O'Hara that showed O'Hara 's fictional world in the state 's anthracite coalfields ( Bruccoli 1975 ; Cuff and others 1989 , 165 ) . In many short stories and several novels , O'Hara brought to life characters who resided in the small city of Gibbsville and surrounding Lantenengo County . These places were thinly veiled fictional representations of Pottsville in Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania . Some critics have noted that he did for Lantenengo County , or " the Region , " what William Faulkner did for Yoknapatawpha County in Mississippi ( Aiken 1977 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent on delineating its social dimensions through fiction during the middle third of the twentieth century , created a fictional world in which I have discovered  --  really have only glimpsed at this moment  --  a dynamic regional social geography quite likely representative and therefore pertinent to the historical geography of America . <p> The son of a Pottsville doctor , O'Hara had a modestly privileged childhood but rebelled against his father 's high expectations and stern parenting ( Wolff 2003 , 3-79 ) . In the twenty-three years he lived in the Region before leaving for New York to become a writer , O'Hara developed an understanding of its diverse social groups and experienced its many different places . Numerous readers from southeastern Pennsylvania readily correlated his fictional places with real ones in Pottsville and the Region . They also tried to identify the real models for his fictional characters . In this exercise they were less successful , although a fictional doctor 's son , Jimmy Malloy , often exhibited similarities with O'Hara himself ( Wolff 2003 , 25-28 ) . O'Hara insisted that his characters were creations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Region bear close resemblance to reality . <p> O'Hara was not primarily interested in describing place . His themes involved social distinctions , manners , morals , and , from the frictions of these social divisions , the dilemmas of " social cruelty , human isolation , the need for love and the hell of loneliness " that torture individuals functioning within the social system ( Bruccoli 1975 , 72 ; see also 177 ) . His method as a novelist has been variously depicted by him and critics as " social realism , " " social history , " and " naturalism . " Without exploring the distinctions among these terms , suffice it to say that O'Hara used accuracy in dialogue , custom , and material culture to convey social stratification . For O'Hara , biographer Bruccoli wrote , " accurate dialogue is governed by the character 's **27;2175;TOOLONG background " ( 1975,115 ) . The credibility of what he had to say , he believed , depended on the accuracy of his representations . Consequently , many critics disdainfully considered him more of a social historian than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was meant to demean his literary achievement . <p> Despite such protestations , O'Hara stressed at other times that he was concerned to tell " the truth about his time " ( Bruccoli 1975 , xvi ) . In his forward to Sermons and Soda-Water , a collection of three novellas , he stated his intention as an author to provide a social history : " The United States in this Century is what I know , and it is my business to write about it to the best of my ability , with the sometimes special knowledge I have . The Twenties , the Thirties , and the Forties are already history , but I can not be content to leave their story in the hands of the historians and the editors of picture books . I want to record the way people talked and thought and felt , and to do it with complete honesty and variety " ( O'Hara 1960 , 6 ) . As geographers have long known , place is as much a part of the social environment as are lineage , schooling , memberships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the make of automobile one drives . One might surmise , therefore , that accuracy about place fit with O'Hara 's desire to provide credible social context for , and construction of , his characters . Gibbsville and Lantenengo County constituted that place , and , as biographer Geoffrey Wolff recognizes , the Region was ideally suited in its size , demographically and geographically , for such a purpose . Wolff wrote , " It also helped O'Hara 's imaginative reach and power of connection  --  the structure itself of his fiction  --  that Pottsville and the Region were ideally scaled to encourage a writer to explore networks of manners and economy , family and ethnic stresses , ambition and exclusion " ( 2003 , 48 ) . O'Hara 's vision also extended beyond the Region , since it was embedded in a larger region . When writing about the Region , O'Hara had his characters live , work , and play throughout what geographers might call the southeastern Pennsylvania hinterland of Philadelphia . He changed the names of towns within the Region but generally left intact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were outside the Region but nonetheless part of his fictional characters ' frame of reference . <p> Before he fled Pottsville in 1928 , O'Hara traveled extensively about the Region . He often journeyed by trolley or train with his mother to his grandparents ' farm 30 miles away near Lykens , and once there he accompanied his grandfather 's grocery deliveryman on his rounds among the towns of that part of the Region . He became a good horseman at his father 's horse farm and attended races at several of southeastern Pennsylvania 's small cities . He visited collieries , small mining-company towns , and rail yards when he went with his father to tend to the sick , injured , and dying . As a young man chafing from paternal disgrace for several academic failures and other transgressions , O'Hara worked as a reporter for the Pottsville Journal and caroused among the diverse and often contentious ethnic and class groups that populated the Region ( Wolff 2003 , 3-79 ) . <p> Pottsville  --  that is , Gibbsville  --  was the center of banking , mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat ) , and various other services for the Region 's anthracite , manufacturing , and farming enterprises . Pottsville functioned as a small city within the larger hinterland that centered on Philadelphia ( Conzen 2001 , 337-341 ) . The Region was a subregion of that hinterland . Although 100 miles south and east of Pottsville , Philadelphia sat at the apex of the economic and social system . Philadelphia capitalists bought up the coal lands . Early in the nineteenth century shippers brought coal to the Quaker City by canal down the Schuylkill River Valley . Later , Philadelphia railroads , the Pennsylvania and the Reading , linked the coalfields to the city 's markets , tying the Region even more tightly to the metropolis . O'Hara personally experienced the primacy of Philadelphia . His father trained in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and returned there often to enhance his surgical skills . He took his son to the city for the university 's football games and dreamed of entering him and his horse in the upscale Philadelphia horse show . John 's first love went to Bryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , having gotten another girl pregnant , reportedly solved the problem in the city of Brotherly Love ( Wolff 2003 , 31 ) . <p> The economic relationships of metropolis , hinterland cities and towns , and the surrounding countryside  --  the regional economic system  --  are familiar ground for geographers . But the historical social geographies of regional systems have not been explored well . O'Hara did not expressly write about economic activities ; nor did he develop his fictional characters through their work , for which he was often criticized . Rather , he placed them within the social dimensions of the Region and the larger hinterland system . His characters both displayed and were acutely aware of the social distinctions and relationships among the different places of the regional hierarchy . He knew these distinctions from first-hand experience , and through his obsession with accuracy  --  the clubs , schools , romances , marriages , cars , clothes , and speech  --  revealed this social fabric within which individuals functioned . Through their social customs , material details , and goals he unfolded for the reader a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed from his voluminous writings . <p> A few historians have examined the differential and changing composition of elites in regional social systems , recording the upward locational movement in the hierarchy over time as economic power and thereby social prestige inexorably shifted toward the metropolis ( Folsom 1981 ; Davies 1985 ) . The closeness of fit between the geographical distributions of economic power and social prestige are not well known , and the difference between them might well have significant implications when dramatic economic transformations take place . In the myriad possible social indicators that an innovative and inexhaustible researcher like Wilbur Zelinsky might conceive , an historical social geography awaits discovery for any metropolitan hinterland , whether it be the Maryland Eastern Shore of the Baltimore-Washington area , southwestern Pennsylvania ( to name two regions familiar to me ) , or , say , southwestern Wisconsin around Milwaukee . O'Hara limned the contours for such a study for the middle decades of the twentieth century through his fiction . PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL NETWORKS <p> My experience in reading John O'Hara 's Pennsylvania short stories and novels underscores the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biography is another genre that has expanded my understanding of American geography . Some biographers wonderfully evoke the physical and social landscapes that in some manner informed their subjects . Robert Caro 's ( 1982 ) first book of his masterful , three-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson serves as an example . Caro presents an outstanding , though too dependent on Frederick Jackson Turner 's ( 1961 ) frontier theory of American democracy for my taste , piece of landscape writing in his depiction of the early-twentieth-century Texas hill country that was home to the thirty-sixth president . However , geographical settings are not what I have in mind . Rather , biographies of individuals working in a particular profession such as American planning or living during a particular era , such as writers or politicians in the middle third of the twentieth century , have revealed to me both additional writing that I had not known existed and , more important , the significance of personal and professional networks for understanding how decisions and plans came to be . Thus my enjoyment in having read Mencken , Stegner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , the networks of these writers , laid out in the biographies , identified additional writers and professionals of interest . The cycle of discovery went on . <p> Late one evening during the 1994 annual meeting of the Association of American Geographers , I browsed the voluminous holdings of a used bookstore , saw the name " Stegner " on the spine of a book , purchased it , and embarked on yet another intellectual adventure . Titled The Uneasy Chair , my new acquisition turned out to be an exhaustive biography of Bernard DeVoto ( Stegner 1988 ) . I knew that in the 1940s DeVoto had written a famous historical trilogy on the exploration and settlement of the American West , but until I read The Uneasy Chair I was unaware that he was also a sagacious commentator on the American scene . An essayist , literary critic , editor , and failed novelist , DeVoto became a familiar feature writer in magazines of the 1930s and afterward . He assumed the prestigious " Easy Chair " column of Harper 's Magazine in 1935 and contributed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in 1955 . Much to my surprise , I also learned that he was a leading conservationist in the mid  --  twentieth century and spearheaded the battle against western congressmen and livestock interests who were angling to privatize public lands . Upon reading his conservationist essays , mostly in Harper 's Magazine , I realized that his struggle with western opponents to the federal lands was a perennial one , surfacing again in the 1980s as the Sagebrush Rebellion and carried on in Republican-led Congresses since the mid-1990s . I have since collected into a book many of these essays , along with others of his on the West and on protecting the national parks from resource development , another issue of concern today ( Muller 2005 ) . Moreover , Stegner 's biography of his friend , fellow westerner , and colleague delineated DeVoto 's network of conservationists , which led me back to Benton MacKaye ( who conceived the idea of the Appalachian Trail ) and some of America 's most illustrious early planners about whom I had been reading , for both pleasure and professional interest ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became interested in the emergence of professional planning in the first third of the twentieth century . Pittsburgh 's early experience with city planning involved three giants of the new profession , Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. , Harland Bartholomew , and Robert Moses . Each was at different times a consultant to the city , and their professional practices , philosophies , and networks were important to my understanding the Pittsburgh story ( Bauman and Muller 2006 ) . Each had a connection with Pittsburgh 's primary in-house planner , Frederick Bigger , during the period . He in turn had close relationships with several other notable planners and intellectuals , such as Clarence Stein and Lewis Mumford , who were part of a broad professional network . The biographies and letters of these men and women pointed to the inspiration and precedents provided by an earlier nineteenth-century generation , to the personal and professional networks of those who worked between 1900 and 1940 , and to their legacies for succeeding planners of the mid-twentieth century . Although historians of American planning have generally laid out the contours of planning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. , to Catherine Bauer and James Rouse , the biographies demonstrate the importance of individual agency , connections among professionals , and even serendipity in shaping outcomes of planning philosophy , policies , programs , and projects . They make specific designed landscapes less simply manifestations of macroforces and macropolicies and more than the scholarly literature often suggests , the products of particular personalities compromising their visions with the inevitable demands of clients and other exigencies . <p> A paradox in the career of Pittsburgh 's Frederick Bigger offers an example of the utility of biography for understanding the past . Bigger dominated planning in the Smoky City during the 1920s and 1930s . Roy Lubove , the initial historian of the city 's planning experience , criticized Bigger as a detail-obsessed planning technician without either the vision for grand plans or the ability to implement major projects ( Lubove 1969 ) . At times Bigger even called himself a " technical planner . " In some of the interwar era 's national planning milestones , historians have mentioned Bigger 's involvement , but without elaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Regional Planning Association of America ( RPAA ) in 1923 , the ad hoc , mildly socialistic group that advocated visionary designs of city housing projects and neighborhoods as well as garden-city-style planning for metropolitan development ( Lubove 1963 , 40 ; Scott 1969 , 223 ) . Bigger also had an invited essay in the 1925 special issue on city planning of the Journal of the American Institute of Architects , in which he lamented the political and economic limitations to planning established cities and , like his RPAA colleagues , advocated regional planning , whereby the design and development of new towns could be controlled from the outset ( Bigger 1925 , 211 ) . In the mid-1930s he became the chief planner of the New Deal 's innovative greenbelt town program , which built three new suburban communities based on principles not generally employed by either the real estate industry or most planners . How could Bigger 's technical-planning proclivity in Pittsburgh be reconciled with his involvement with visionary planning on the national scene ? <p> The answer lies in part with the political situation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish an effective Department of Planning , retrofit the city for the automobile , and implement zoning . The explanation is also found in Bigger 's personality and connections with Progressive Era planners committed to reforming housing and cities ( Bauman and Muller 2002 ) . Evidence suggests , but is not conclusive , that he participated in the federal government 's innovative World War I defense housing program , where he likely met Charles H. Whitaker among other architects and planners who would become lifelong colleagues . Whitaker convened the RPAA , which met at Clarence Stein 's New York atelier , and probably invited Bigger to attend . Stein was at the center of the RPAA activities ; he and Henry Wright designed key housing projects in the 1920s , which were precedents for the greenbelt towns . Through the RPAA Bigger actively participated in this national network of planners who were dissatisfied with the state of American cities and low-income housing . He maintained a lifelong relationship with Stein and kept in touch with Henry Wright , Frederick Ackerman , and several others of that group ( C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged the gritty , often political battles in Pittsburgh over zoning , new streets , and ordinary residential subdivisions , he envisioned grander solutions to the nation 's urban problems by participating in the imaginative and at times even radical activities and plans of colleagues like the critic Lewis Mumford , the housing reformer Catherine Bauer , and Stein . Through this network , Bigger 's reformist dreams found expression and even were put into action when Stein and Wright proposed him for the greenbelt towns position . In addition to Bigger 's few extant writings , the letters and biographies of these colleagues fill out the picture of this important planner , who bridged the era 's intractable planning problems and its grand ideas . A LIFELONG JOURNEY <p> In 1939 Robert Lawson published an amusing and fanciful tale about Amos the mouse , who lived in Ben Franklin 's Philadelphia row house and accompanied the founding father wherever he went while perched comfortably in his fur cap , altered for this purpose . Ben welcomed Amos 's residence in his house and cap , where in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's affairs . Lawson titled the little book Ben and Me , for it purported to be an edited version of a tiny manuscript in mouse handwriting found 150 years later by workmen remodeling the house . In it Amos claimed to have been responsible for many of Ben 's greatest decisions and inventions . " For many years I was his closest friend and adviser and , if I do say it , was in great part responsible for his success and fame . Not that I wish to claim too much : I simply hope to see justice done , credit given where credit is due , and that 's to me  --  mostly " ( Lawson 1939 , 4 ) . <p> In titling my essay , " Wilbur and Me , " I do not , of course , claim any responsibility for Wilbur Zelinsky 's astonishing academic success or imply that , like Ben , Wilbur had some extraordinary helper about whom we do not know . I am simply looking back on that trip to Louisville with Wilbur and the wonderful , long ride that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , more than a quarter of a century later . It has been a journey of enormous personal enjoyment and professional enrichment . Over the years , leisure reading has mixed with professional pursuits , often without conscious design , and the resulting brew has yielded immeasurable rewards for my classrooms and my scholarship . <p>
