THE MACHINES BROKE DOWN so much that it was comical , but the security people never laughed about that . <p> Felix could endure the delay , for plumbers billed by the hour . He opened his tool kit , extracted a plastic flask and had a solid nip of Scotch . <p> The Moslem girl was chattering into her phone . Her dad and another bearded weirdo had passed through the big metal frame just as the scanner broke down . So these two somber , suited old men were getting the full third degree with the hand wands , while daughter was stuck . Daughter wore a long baggy coat and thick black headscarf and a surprisingly sexy pair of sandals . Between her and her minders stretched the no man 's land of official insecurity . She waved across the gap . <p> The security geeks found something metallic in the black wool jacket of the Wicked Uncle . Of course it was harmless , but they had to run their full ritual , lest they die of boredom at their posts . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Miss Mujihadeen discovered that her phone was dying . She banged at it with the flat of her hand . <p> The line of hopeful shoppers , grimly waiting to stimulate the economy , shifted in their disgruntlement . It was a bad , bleak scene . It crushed Felix 's heart within him . He longed to leap to his feet and harangue the lot of them . Wake up , he wanted to scream at them , cheer up , act more human . He felt the urge keenly , but it scared people when he cut loose like that . They really hated it . And so did he . He knew he could n't look them in the eye . It would only make a lot of trouble . <p> The Mideastern men shouted at the girl . She waved her dead phone at them , as if another breakdown was going to help their mood . Then Felix noticed that she shared his own make of cell phone . She had a rather ahead-of-the-curve Finnish model that he 'd spent a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Help you out with that phone , ma'am ? " <p> She gave him the paralyzed look of a coed stuck with a dripping tap . <p> " No English ? " he concluded . " Habla espanol , senorita ? " No such luck . <p> He offered her his own phone . No , she did n't care to use it . Surprised and even a little hurt by this rejection , Felix took his first good look at her , and realized with a lurch that she was pretty . What eyes ! They were whirlpools . The line of her lips was like the tapered edge of a rose leaf . <p> " It 's your battery , " he told her . Though she had not a word of English , she obviously got it about phone batteries . After some gestured persuasion , she was willing to trade her dead battery for his . There was a fine and delicate little moment when his fingertips extracted her power supply , and he inserted his own unit into that golden-lined copper cavity . Her display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix pressed a button or two , smiled winningly , and handed her phone back . <p> She dialed in a hurry , and bearded Evil Dad lifted his phone to answer , and life became much easier on the nerves . Then , with a groaning buzz , the scanner came back on . Dad and Uncle waved a command at her , like lifers turned to trusty prison guards , and she scampered through the metal . gate and never looked back . <p> She had taken his battery . Well , no problem . He would treasure the one she had given him . <p> Felix gallantly let the little crowd through before he himself cleared security . The geeks always went nuts about his plumbing tools , but then again , they had to . He found the assignment : a chi-chi place that sold fake antiques and potpourri . The manager 's office had a clogged drain . As he worked , Felix recharged the phone . Then he socked them for a sum that made them wince . <p> On his leisurely way out - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that little goddess , browsing in a jewelry store over Korean gold chains and tiaras . Dad and Uncle were there , with a couple of off-duty cops . <p> Felix retired to a bench beside the fountain , in the potted plastic plants . He had another bracing shot of Scotch , then put his feet up on his toolbox and punched her number . <p> He saw her straighten at the ring , and open her purse , and place the phone to the kerchiefed side of her head . She did n't know where he was , or who he was . That was why the words came pouring out of him . <p> " My God you 're pretty , " he said . " You are wasting your time with that jewelry . Because your eyes are like two black diamonds . " <p> She jumped a little , poked at the phone 's buttons with disbelief , and put it back to her head . <p> Felix choked back the urge to laugh and leaned forward , his elbows on his knees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peanuts , " he told the phone . " I am totally smitten with you . What are you like under that big baggy coat ? Do I dare to wonder ? I would give a million dollars just to see your knees ! " <p> " Why are you telling me that ? " said the phone . <p> " Because I 'm looking at you right now . And after one look at you , believe me , I was a lost soul . " Felix felt a chill . " Hey , wait a minute-you do n't speak English , do you ? " <p> " No , I do n't speak English - but my telephone does . " <p> " It does ? " <p> " It 's a very new telephone . It 's from Finland , " the telephone said . " I need it because I 'm stuck in a foreign country . Do you really have a million dollars for my knees ? " <p> " That was a figure of speech , " said Felix , though his bank account was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his girlfriend Lola had dumped him . " Never mind the million dollars , " he said . " I 'm dying of love out here . I 'd sell my blood just to buy you petunias . " <p> " You must be a famous poet , " the phone said dreamily , " for you speak such wonderful Farsi . " <p> Felix had no idea what Farsi was - but he was way beyond such fretting now . The rusty gates of his soul were shuddering on their hinges . <p> " I 'm drunk , " he realized . " I am drunk on your smile . " <p> " In my family , the women never smile . " <p> Felix had no idea what to say to that , so there was a hissing silence . <p> " Are you a spy ? How did you get my phone number ? " <p> " I 'm not a spy . I got your phone number from your phone . " <p> " Then I know you . You must be that tall foreign man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Look outside the store . See me on the bench ? " She turned where she stood , and he waved his fingertips . " That 's right , it 's me , " he declared to her . " I ca n't believe I 'm really going through with this . You just stand there , okay ? I 'm going to run in there and buy you a wedding ring . " <p> " Do n't do that . " She glanced cautiously at Dad and Uncle , then stepped closer to the bulletproof glass . " Yes , I do see you . I remember you . " <p> She was looking straight at him . Their eyes met . They were connecting . A hot torrent ran up his spine . " You are looking straight at me . " <p> " You 're very handsome . " <p> IT WAS N'T HARD to elope . Young women had been eloping since the dawn of time . Elopement with eager phone support was a snap . He followed her to the hotel , a posh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a bag with a big hat , sunglasses , and a cheap Mexican wedding dress . He sneaked into the women 's restroom - they never put videocams there , due to the complaints - and he left the bag in a stall . She went in , came out in new clothes with her hair loose , and walked straight out of the hotel and into his car . <p> They could n't speak together without their phones , but that turned out to be surprisingly advantageous , as further discussion was not on their minds . Unlike Lola , who was always complaining that he should open up and relate - " You 're a plumber , " she would tell him , " how deep and mysterious is a plumber supposed to be ? " - the new woman in his life had needs that were very straightforward . She liked to walk in parks without a police escort . She liked to thoughtfully peruse the goods in Mideastern ethnic groceries . And she liked to make love to him . She was nineteen years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridges for his little refugee . Once she got fully briefed about what went inside where , she was in the mood to tame the demon . She had big , jagged , sobbing , alarming , romantic , brink-of-the-grave things going on , with long , swoony kisses , and heel-drumming , and clutching-and-clawing . <p> When they were too weak , and too raw , and too tingling to make love any more , then she would cook , very badly . She was on her phone constantly , talking to her people . These confidantes of hers were obviously women , because she asked them for Persian cooking tips . She would sink with triumphant delight into cheery chatter as the Basmati rice burned . <p> He longed to take her out to eat ; to show her to everyone , to the whole world ; really , besides the sex , no act could have made him happier - but she was undocumented , and sooner or later some security geek was sure to check on that . People did things like that to people nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whole affair , so , mostly , he did n't think . He took time off work , and he spent every moment that he could in her radiant presence , and she did what a pretty girl could do to lift a man 's darkened spirits , which was plenty . More than he had ever had from anyone . <p> After ten days of golden , unsullied bliss , ten days of bread and jug wine , ten days when the nightingales sang in chorus and the reddest of roses bloomed outside the boudoir , there came a knock on his door , and it was three cops . <p> " Hello , Mr. Hernandez , " said the smallest of the trio . " I would be Agent Portillo from Homeland Security , and these would be two of my distinguished associates . Might we come in ? " <p> " Would there be a problem ? " said Felix . <p> " Yes there would ! " said Portillo . " There might be rather less of a problem if my associates here could search your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A young woman named Batool Kadivar ? Would we be recognizing Miss Batool Kadivar ? " <p> " I ca n't even pronounce that , " Felix said . " But I guess you 'd better come in , " for Agent Portillo 's associates were already well on their way . Men of their ilk were not prepared to take no for an answer . They shoved past him and headed at once for the bedroom . <p> " Who are those guys ? They 're not American . " <p> " They 're Iranian allies . The Iranians were totally nuts for a while , and then they were sort of okay , and then they became our new friends , and then the enemies of our friends became our friends .... Do you ever watch TV news , Mr. Hernandez ? Secular uprisings , people seizing embassies ? Ground war in the holy city of Qom , that kind of thing ? " <p> " It 's hard to miss , " Felix admitted . <p> " There are a billion Moslems . If they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a choice about that . You know something ? I used to be an accountant ! " Portillo sighed theatrically . " ' Homeland Security . ' Why 'd they have to stick me with that chicken outfit ? Hombre , we 're twenty years old , and we do n't even have our own budget yet . Did you see those gorillas I 've got on my hands ? You think these guys ever listen to sense ? Geneva Convention ? U.S. Constitution ? Come on . " <p> " They 're not gon na find any terrorists in here . " <p> Portillo sighed again . " Look , Mr. Hernandez . You 're a young man with a clean record , so I want to do you a favor . " He adjusted his handheld and it showed a new screen . " These are cell phone records . Thirty , forty calls a day , to and from your number . Then look at this screen , this is the good part . Check out her call records . That would be her aunt in Yerevan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or six of her teenage girlfriends , still living back in purdah .... Who do you think is gon na pay that phone bill ? Did that ever cross your mind ? " <p> Felix said nothing . <p> " I can understand this , Mr. Hernandez . You lucked out . You 're a young , red-blooded guy and that is a very pretty girl . But she 's a minor , and an illegal alien . Her father 's family has got political connections like nobody 's business , and I would mean nobody , and I would also mean business . " <p> " Not my business , " Felix said . <p> " You 're being a sap , Mr. Hernandez . You may notbe interested in war , but war is plenty interested in you . " There were loud crashing , sacking and looting noises coming from his bedroom . <p> " You are sunk , hermano . There is video at the Lebanese grocery store . There is video hidden in the traffic lights . You 're a free American citizen , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're free to watch all the backup tapes . That would be the big story I 'm relating here . Would we be catching on yet ? " <p> " That 's some kind of story , " Felix said . <p> " You do n't know the half of it . You do n't know the tenth . " <p> The two goons reappeared . There was a brief exchange of notes . They had to use their computers . <p> " My friends here are disappointed , " said Agent Portillo , " because there is no girl in your residence , even though there is an extensive selection of makeup and perfume . They want me to arrest you for abduction , and obstruction of justice , and probably ten or twelve other things . But I would be asking myself : why ? Why should this young taxpayer with a steady job want to have his life ruined ? What I 'm thinking is : there must be another story . A better story . The flighty girl ran off , and she spent the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse thing for her . She got frightened and upset by America , and then she came back to her people . Everything diplomatic . " <p> " That 's diplomacy ? " <p> " Diplomacy is the art of avoiding extensive unpleasantness for all the parties concerned . The united coalition , as it were . " <p> " They 'll chop her hands off and beat her like a dog ! " <p> " Well , that would depend , Mr. Hernandez . That would depend entirely on whether the girl herself tells that story . Somebody would have to get her up to speed on all that . A trusted friend . You see ? " <p> AFTER THE DEPARTURE of the three security men , Felix thought through his situation . He realized there was nothing whatsoever in it for him but shame , humiliation , impotence , and a crushing and lasting unhappiness . He then fetched up the reposado tequila from beneath his sink . <p> Some time later he felt the dulled stinging of a series of slaps to his head . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tequila onto the floor , accenting this gesture with an eye-opening Persian harangue . Felix staggered to the bathroom , threw up , and returned to find a fresh cup of coffee . She had raised the volume and was still going strong . <p> He 'd never had her pick a lovers ' quarrel with him , though he 'd always known it was in her somewhere . It was magnificent . It was washing over him in a musical torrent of absolute nonsense . It was operatic , and he found it quite beautiful . Like sitting through a rainstorm without getting wet : trees straining , leaves flying , dark , windy , torrential . Majestic . <p> Her idea of coffee was basically wet grounds , so it brought him around in short order . " You 're right , I 'm wrong , and I 'm sorry , " he admitted tangentially , knowing she did n't understand a word , " so come on and help me , " and he opened the sink cabinet , where he had hidden all his bottles when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down the drain : vodka , Southern Comfort , the gin , the party jug of tequila , even the last two inches of his favorite single-malt . Moslems did n't drink , and really , how wrong could any billion people be ? He gulped a couple of aspirin and picked up the phone . <p> " The police were here . They know about us . I got upset . I drank too much . " <p> " Did they beat you ? " <p> " Uh , no . They 're not big fans of beating over here , they 've got better methods . They 'll be back . We are in big trouble . " <p> She folded her arms . " Then we 'll run away . " <p> " You know , we have a proverb for that in America . ' You can run , but you ca n't hide . " ' <p> " Darling , I love your poetry , but when the police come to the house , it 's serious . " <p> " Yes . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got no LD . You have no passport . You ca n't get on any plane to get away . Even the trains and lousy bus stations have facial recognition . My car is useless too . They 'd read my license plate a hundred times before we hit city limits . I ca n't rent another car without leaving credit records . The cops have got my number . " <p> " We 'll steal a fast car and go very fast . " <p> " You ca n't outrun them ! That is not possible ! They 've all got phones like we do , so they 're always ahead of us , waiting . " <p> " I 'm a rebel ! I 'll never surrender ! " She lifted her chin . " Let 's get married . " <p> " I 'd love to , but we ca n't . We have no license . We have no blood test . " <p> " Then we 'll marry in some place where they have all the blood they want . Beirut , that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " We were married in my heart , the first time we ever made love . " <p> This artless confession blew through him like a summer breeze . <p> " They do have rings for cash at a pawnbroker 's .... But I 'm a Catholic . There must be somebody who does this sort of thing .... Maybe some heretic mullah . Maybe a Santeria guy ? " <p> " If we 're husband and wife , what can they do to us ? We have n't done anything wrong ! I 'll get a Green Card . I 'll beg them ! I 'll beg for mercy . I 'll beg political asylum . " <p> Agent Portillo conspicuously cleared his throat . " Mr. Hernandez , please ! This would not be the conversation you two need to be having . " <p> " I forgot to mention the worst part , " Felix said . " They know about our phones . " <p> " Miss Kadivar , can you also understand me ? " <p> " Who are you ? I hate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <p> " Salaam alekom to you , too , " Portillo concluded . " It 's a sad commentary on federal procurement when a mullah 's daughter has a fancy translator , and I ca n't even talk live with my own fellow agents . By the way , those two gentlemen from the new regime in Teheran are staking out your apartment . How they failed to recognize your girlfriend on her way in , that I 'll never know . But if you two listen to me , I think I can walk you out of this very dangerous situation . " <p> " I do n't want to leave my beloved , " she said . <p> " Over my dead body , " Felix declared . " Come and get me . Bring a gun . " <p> " Okay , Miss Kadivar , you would seem to be the more rational of the two parties , so let me talk sense to you . You have no future with this man . What kind of wicked man seduces a decent girl with phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playboy . America has a fifty percent divorce rate . He would never ask your father honorably for your hand . What would your mother say ? " <p> " Who is this awful man ? " she said , shaken . " He knows everything ! " <p> " He 's a snake ! " Felix said . " He 's the devil ! " <p> " You still do n't get it , compadre . I 'm not the Great Satan . Really , I 'm not ! I am the good guy . I 'm your guardian angel , dude . I am trying really hard to give you back a normal life . " <p> " Okay cop , you had your say , now listen to me . I love her body and soul , and even if you kill me dead for that , the flames in my heart will set my coffin on fire . " <p> She burst into tears . " Oh God , my God , that 's the most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped . " This would be mental illness that I 'm eavesdropping on here ! You two do n't even speak each other 's language . You had every fair warning ! Just remember , when it happens , you made me do it . Now try this one on for size , Romeo and Juliet . " The phones went dead . <p> Felix placed his dead phone on the tabletop . " Okay . Situation report . We 've got no phones , no passports , no ID and two different intelligence agencies are after us . We ca n't fly , we ca n't drive , we ca n't take a train or a bus . My credit cards are useless now , my bank cards will just track me down , and I guess I 've lost my job now . I ca n't even walk out my own front door .... And wow , you do n't understand a single word I 'm saying . I can tell from that look in your eye . You are completely thrilled . " <p> She put her finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . <p> Apparently , she had a new plan . It involved walking . She wanted to walk to Los Angeles . She knew the words " Los Angeles , " and maybe there was somebody there that she knew . This trek would involve crossing half the American continent on foot , but Felix was at peace with that ambition . He really thought he could do it . A lot of people had done it just for the sake of gold nuggets , back in 1849 . Women had walked to California just to meet a guy with gold nuggets . <p> The beautiful part of this scheme was that , after creeping out the window , they really had vanished . The feds might be all over the airports , over everything that mattered , but they did n't care about what did n't matter . Nobody was looking out for dangerous interstate pedestrians . <p> To pass the time as they walked , she taught him elementary Farsi . The day 's first lesson was body parts , because that was all they had handy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this expanded their passionate communion . He was perfectly willing to starve for that , fight for that and die for that . Every form of intercourse between man and woman was fraught with illusion , and the bigger , the better . Every hour that passed was an hour they had not been parted . <p> They had to sleep rough . Their clothes became filthy . Then , on the tenth day , they got arrested . <p> She was , of course , an illegal alien , and he had the good sense to talk only Spanish , so of course , he became one as well . The Immigration cops piled them into the bus for the border , but they got two seats together and were able to kiss and hold hands . The other deported wretches even smiled at them . <p> He realized now that he was sacrificing everything for her : his identity , his citizenship , flag , church , habits , money .... Everything , and good riddance . He bit thoughtfully into his wax-papered cheese sandwich . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with an apple , a small carton of homogenized milk , and some carrot chips . <p> When the protein hit his famished stomach Felix realized that he had gone delirious with joy . He was growing by this experience . It had broken every stifling limit within him . His dusty , savage , squalid world was widening drastically . <p> Giving alms , for instance - before his abject poverty , he 'd never understood that alms were holy . Alms were indeed very holy . From now on - as soon as he found a place to sleep , some place that was so wrecked , so torn , so bleeding , that it never asked uncomfortable questions about a plumber - as soon as he became a plumber again , then he 'd be giving some alms . <p> She ate her food , licked her fingers , then fell asleep against him , in the moving bus . He brushed the free hair from her dirty face . She was twenty days older now . " This is a pearl , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare to be contained within the shell of time and space . " <p> Why had those lines come to him , in such a rush ? Had he read them somewhere ? Or were those lines his own ? <p> Author Affiliation
