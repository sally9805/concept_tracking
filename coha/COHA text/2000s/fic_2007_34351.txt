The sky was blue and the air was cold . Big fir trees stretched as far as the eye could see in every direction . In the tiny knothole of a huge pine tree , three little chipmunks were working hard . They had to store their nuts away before the full cold blast of winter set in . The weather was already chillier . They sang and chirped and tried not to shiver . One of the chipmunks , named Alvin , suddenly stopped in mid-song and threw a worm-infested nut down to the ground . He folded his arms and looked out across the forest . " Alvin , what are you doing ? " asked Simon , his brother . Alvin sighed . " I ca n't take this anymore ! " Simon , who was the oldest chipmunk , frowned . " Then by all means , stop . " Simon paused and glared at Alvin . " I 'm sure when you get hungry this winter you can order a pizza . " Theodore staggered over , his little arms full . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , " he mumbled . " See , Alvin ? " said Simon . " That 's how it 's done . " " Those are not nuts ! " exclaimed Alvin . " What ? " mumbled Theodore , with his mouth full . Alvin reached out and grabbed one from Theodore and shook his head . " These are rocks . Not nuts . " Alarmed , Theodorespat them out . " I thought they were a little crunchy , " he said . Simon squinted and peered at the little pile at Theodore 's feet . " Yup , " he said . " Rocks . " In his frustrated mood , Alvin kicked a rock off the branch . " I 'm sick of struggling for survival . I 'm sick of scratching around in the dirt searching for food . " He kicked the branch of the tree he was sitting on . " And I 'm especially sick of this stupid , stupid tree ! " The pine tree started to shake when he kicked it . Snow fell from its branches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tree kept shaking and a loud whirring noise roared through the forest . " What 's happening ? " cried Simon . " I think Alvin made it angry ! " said Theodore , scared . " What 's it gon na do ? " said Alvin . The tree started to teeter , and Alvin clutched Simon and Theodore . " Whoa ! " screamed all the chipmunks , and they jumped into their knothole at the very last moment . The pine tree , cut down by a chainsaw , toppled to the ground . The huge fallen tree was quickly wrapped up in plastic netting by men in green jumpsuits . All together , they hoisted the tree up and carried it to a long , red truck already loaded with more firs cut for Christmas . When the tree was finally settled in the truck bed , Alvin poked his head out of the knothole for one last look at the forest . The truck sped away , winding its way down the mountain road , rolling through a tiny town , and finally speeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the truck rumbled past a billboard that said : Welcome to the city of Los Angeles !
