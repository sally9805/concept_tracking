Tuesday , August 22 , 1837 <p> Peace of mind ! Oh , the oblivion of peace of mind ! They were Charmaine 's last thoughts as she drifted off to sleep . Like a prayer answered , she succumbed to a deep and restful slumber , the first she 'd had in three long nights . <p> Songbirds in the great oak just outside her window awoke her , and she lay abed enjoying nature 's symphony , a harbinger of the brilliant day ahead , one that was perfect for a picnic . Sherose and peeked into the children 's room . They were fast asleep . She began to dress , determined to get an early start . <p> The letter she had written to Loretta Harrington sat propped on her chest of drawers . She scanned the pages , resurrecting the turmoil of the past three days . <p> <p> I was pleased to receive your letter . . . I am quite well . . . The children are a constant comfort to me and I enjoy my position on the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to so cruel a woman as Agatha Ward . . . I avoid her whenever possible . . . Paul is the consummate gentleman , and aside from Rose and George Richards , I sometimes feel he is the only friend I have in the house . . . George returned this past week , but you should not harbor hope of him as a possible suitor . . . my thoughts have been far from such concerns . . . John Duvoisin has ventured home , even though it is whispered his father forbade him to do so . His presence has rekindled my former reservations concerning matrimony . I can understand Frederic Duvoisin 's disdain for his own flesh and blood , for John is a rude , ill-bred , detestable cur who spends his days closeted in his apartments drinking from dawn to dusk . I 've tried to avoid him at all costs , but he appears at the worst possible times , and I find myself poorly equipped to respond to his sarcasm . He has taken a dislike to me for a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his intended bride , the widow Anne Westphal London . . . Do you know her ? But I am not the only person he ridicules . He wages war with practically everyone , including his aunt or stepmother , as the case may be . . . Tell Mr. Harrington he was never more correct in his opinion of a person than he was of this man . Please give everyone my love . . . <p> <p> Sighing , she tucked the letter into its envelope . Then she sat at her dressing table and began brushing out her unruly hair . <p> The serenity of the morning was shattered by a series of vociferous oaths that brought her straight to her feet and into the corridor . Joseph Thornfield was racing down the stairs , a wooden bucket tumbling after him , ricocheting off the walls and splattering water everywhere . <p> " Damn it , boy ! I love hot baths almost as much as I love music , but I refuse to be scalded into singing soprano in a boys ' choir ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped . There stood John Duvoisin , dripping wet from head to toe , leaning far over the banister , and shouting after the servant boy . He was naked save for a bath towel clasped around his waist , unperturbed by his indecent state of undress . Charmaine compared him to Paul  --  the gold standard by which she assessed all men  --  annoyed to find his toned body rivaled his brother 's : wide shoulders , corded arms , and taut stomach , which sported a reddish hue . Belatedly , she realized she was no longer staring at his back . She grimaced as she lifted her gaze and her eyes connected with his . A jeering smile broke across his face , his pain apparently forgotten now that he had the governess for an audience . <p> " You 're as red as a ripe apple , my Charm . I thought my brother had shown you a man 's body , or did I interrupt that lesson in anatomy the other night ? " <p> Degraded , Charmaine marched back into her bedchamber and slammed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal ; it was a full minute before his laughter receded from the hallway . <p> It was still early when she left her room again . Her plans for a quiet breakfast had been dashed . John had effectively roused the entire household , except for Agatha , who ate in her boudoir . Paul , George , and Rose converged on the staircase . Charmaine prayed John would be delayed , but , lately , none of her prayers were being answered . He appeared just as they reached the dining room . <p> " Good morning , everyone ! " he greeted brightly , winking at her . <p> She glowered in response , but he dismissed her , settling at the table with the children , who were thrilled to see him . She hesitated , debating where to sit . With Paul still talking to George in the archway , she remained indecisive . <p> John noticed at once . " Do you plan on eating , Mademoiselle , or will you just stand there and watch us ? You paint the picture of a wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stung like salt in an open wound , the promise of a brilliant day rapidly fading . Taking courage , she stepped closer . <p> " Ah yes , " he mused , pretending ignorance of her quandary and coming to his feet , " the lady expects a gentleman to help her with her chair , but since Paul is preoccupied right now , I suppose a convict like me will just have to do ! " <p> He rounded the table and pulled the chair out for her . With a great flourish , he whisked a napkin through the air and dusted off the seat cushion , finishing his theatrics with a servile bow and a gesture she be seated . She did so with as much aplomb as she could rally , but as she spread her serviette in her lap , her eyes went to Paul , whose jaw was clenched in monumental self-control . <p> John returned to his own chair , and chatted with George , Rose , and the children , the meal uneventful until Jeannette produced the letter Charmaine had written to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph to post , Mademoiselle ? " Charmaine cringed . " Yes , please , " she hastily replied . <p> <br> Continues ...
