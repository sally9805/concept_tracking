1 <br> Looking Up <br> The last thing Richard Hilzoy thought before the bullet entered his brain was , Things are really looking up . <br> He was on his way to the Silicon Valley offices of his lawyer , Alex Treven , who had arranged a meeting with Kleiner Perkins , the Midases of venture capital who could increase a company 's value a hundredfold just by offering to invest . And now Kleiner was considering writing a check to him , Richard Hilzoy , genius , inventor of Obsidian , the world 's most advanced encryption algorithm , destined to render all other network security software obsolete . Alex had already applied for the patent , and if things worked out with the VCs , Hilzoy would be able to rent office space , buy equipment , hire staff  --  everything he needed to finish commercializing the product and bring it online . In a few years he would take the company public , and his shares would be worth a fortune . Or he 'd stay private , and become to security software what Dolby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or Google would buy him  --  they were into everything these days . The main thing was , he was going to be rich . <br> And he deserved it . Working for chump change in an Oracle research laboratory , drinking Red Bull after Red Bull late at night and shivering in the deserted company parking lot for tobacco breaks , enduring the taunts and laughter he knew went on behind his back . Last year his wife had divorced him , and boy was the bitch ever going to be sorry now . If she 'd had any brains she 'd have waited until he was rolling in money and then tried to shake him down . But she 'd never believed in him , and neither had anyone else . Except Alex . <br> He walked down the cracked exterior steps of his San Jose apartment building , squinting against the brilliant morning sun . He could hear the roar of rush hour traffic on Interstate 280 half a block away  --  the whoosh , whoosh of individual cars , trucks grinding gears as they pulled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional angry honk  --  and for once , having to live like this , right on top of the freeway , did n't bother him . Even the cheap bicycles and rusting barbecues and stained plastic garbage containers crammed together against the side of the adjacent building did n't bother him , nor did the reek the autumn breeze carried from the overflowing parking lot Dumpster . <br> Because Alex was going to get him out of this sewer hole . Oracle was a client of Alex 's firm , and Hilzoy was Alex 's contact on patents there . Hilzoy had n't been overly impressed initially . He 'd taken one look at Alex 's blond hair and green eyes and figured him for just another pretty boy  --  rich parents , the right schools , the usual . But he 'd recognized soon enough that Alex knew his shit . Turned out he was n't just a lawyer , but had degrees from Stanford , too  --  undergraduate in electrical engineering , same as Hilzoy , and a Ph.D . in computer science . He knew at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilzoy had finally worked up the nerve to pull him aside and ask about patenting Obsidian , Alex had gotten it right away . Not only had he deferred his fees , he 'd introduced Hilzoy to a group of angel investors who had put in enough money for Hilzoy to quit his day job and buy the equipment he needed . And now he was poised to take money from the biggest swinging dicks of all . All in the space of a single year . Unbelievable . <br> Of course , there were aspects of Obsidian that the VCs might not like if they knew about them . They might even have found them scary . But they would n't know , because there was no reason to tell them . Obsidian could protect networks , and there was n't a Fortune 500 company out there that would n't pay out the wazoo for that . That 's what VCs understood . The rest . . . well , that would all just be his little secret , a kind of insurance policy to fall back on if Obsidian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums . <br> He looked at his watch . He was nervous about the meeting . But there was time enough for a cigarette ; that would calm him down . He stopped at the bottom of the stairs and fired one up . He took a deep drag , then put the pack and the lighter back in his pocket . There was a white van parked next to his car , an ' 88 Buick Regency he 'd bought after selling his Audi during the divorce . humane pest control , the van said . He 'd noticed it here , what , three times in the last week ? Four ? He 'd seen a rat once , under the Dumpster . And there were roaches . Somebody must have made a stink with building management , and now the idiots were trying to show they were doing something about it . Whatever . Pretty soon that would all be someone else 's problem . <br> There were some scares along the way , existing inventions Alex was concerned might prevent them from getting a patent . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could slow things down . But so far Alex had always found a way around the problems . The patent had n't been issued yet , but the application itself was bankable . <br> Hilzoy had been worried at first about describing the source code in the patent application because anyone who got hold of it would know the recipe for Obsidian , but Alex had assured him the Patent and Trademark Office maintained all applications in strict confidence for eighteen months , at which point they 'd have a good idea about whether a patent would be forthcoming . And once the patent was issued , it would n't matter whether people knew the recipe or not  --  they could n't use it without paying him the big bucks . And if they tried to , Alex would sue them into the ground . That 's right , people , you want to play , you got to pay . <br> He paused in front of the Buick and got out his keys . What a piece of crap . It had over a hundred thousand miles on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of car you could piss all over and no one would even notice . A Mercedes , he thought , not for the first time . Or maybe a BMW . Black , a convertible . He 'd have it detailed four times a year so it would always look new . <br> The pest control guy got out of the van . He was wearing a baseball cap , coveralls , and gloves . He nodded to Hilzoy through a pair of shades and moved past him . Hilzoy nodded back , glad he did n't have to kill rats for a living . <br> He took a drag on the cigarette , then tossed it away , enjoying the feeling of wasting it . He blew the smoke up at the sky and unlocked the car door . Yeah , baby , he thought . Oh yeah . Things are really looking up . <br> Continues ...
