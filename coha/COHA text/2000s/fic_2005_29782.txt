Chapter One Magiere sensed the instant of dawn , though the inn 's small room was dark and shuttered . It called her from sleep . This first night with Leesil in her arms lingered in her memory , his shoulder beneath her cheek and her outstretched palm on his chest beneath the blankets . She still feared for him , but perhaps if she kept him always this close , she could keep him safe even from herself . A more troublesome thought wormed into her awareness . She fought it down , recalling the scent and taste and touch of Leesil in the night , until they 'd settled into warm slumber . But the thought would n't leave , and perhaps in part it was Leesil 's closeness that fed it strength . Magelia-and Nein'a . Two mothers waited . One dead , but the second soil lived , or so she hoped-for Leesil 's sake . Magiere opened her eyes to see her fingertips peeking from beneath the blanket 's edge across Leesil 's chest . When she lifted her gaze past his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber eyes looking down at her . " You 're awake , " she said . " I like watching you sleep . It 's the only time you 're peaceful . " Did he always have to make jokes ? Magiere tried to sit up , but his arms closed around her . " Notyet , " he said . " It 's early . I do n't think the sun is even up . " " It will be soon , " she lied , and relaxed back against him . Her dhampir nature had grown more pronounced in recent days . She felt the sun 's presence even when indoors . In the night , the heat Leesil stirred in her made her heightened senses open wide . With only a sliver of moonlight through the window 's shutter crack , she 'd clearly seen his white-blond hair , narrow face , and lithe body . His amber eyes , almond shaped from his half-elven heritage , were locked upon her . At most times , her unnatural senses frightened or sickened her for what they revealed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as all she sensed was him . She was in Leesil 's arms , and little else mattered . Except for two mothers , who 'd each left her child with a dark and bloody heritage . " Did you sleep all right ? " she asked . " A little , " he answered . She knew he might be lying . He often had trouble sleeping , now that he 'd stopped drinking . This , as well , was linked to a mother he 'd thought dead for years . Magiere peered about the room . " Where 's Chap ? Did he stay out all night ? " Leesil smiled . " For once , he showed some manners . " Magiere scowled . She rolled over to reach for the sulfur stick on the bedside table and lit the one candle resting there . The night before , they 'd taken this room at the first inn outside Bela , the capital city of Belaski . The three of them had often slept outdoors in past years . Their dog , Chap , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had n't thought of him all night . She rolled back to find Leesil leaning up on one elbow above her . He slid his fingers between hers , a striped pattern of flesh in the mingling . Half-elf and half-undead , they were a strange contrast with his golden-brown skin and white-blond hair and her blood-tinted black tresses and pale flesh . A mischievous smile crossed Leesil 's lips , and Magiere lost all concern for the moment . Chap could wait a little longer . The candlelight revealed their surroundings more clearly . It was all simple , neat , and pleasant , but it was n't home-was n't the Sea Lion tavern in Miiska . Her falchion leaned against the bedside table , close within reach beside the bed on which they lay . Their travel chest and belongings sat under the window , reminding her that soon they would be on the move again . " What ? " he asked . " Another journey , " she answered . Leesil settled back on the bed , comfortably close as he brushed stands of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies , but as we get farther north and into the Warlands , restocking could get difficult . More so as we move on to the northern mountains and the Crown Range between there and the elven lands . We 'll need more before we leave . " Magiere hesitated . How could she make him face her new choice ? In youth , he 'd fled from slavery as a warlord 's assassin , knowing his escape would cause his own parents ' execution . For years afterward , he drank himself to sleep each night to smother guilt-spawned nightmares . Even Magiere had n't known , until he 'd confessed but a few nights ago . Then an assassin named Sgile-one of the elven anmaglhk-had come to take Leesil 's life . Leesil 's mother had betrayed her own caste by teaching him and his father the anmaglhk 's cold-blooded ways . The assassin changed his mind and let Leesil go . From this encounter , Leesil suspected his mother still lived , imprisoned all these years by her own people . Now that he had hope , Magiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seek your mother , if she still lives , " she said , " we need to go to my home village in Droevinka . " She 'd fled from there nine years ago at the age of sixteen , and the thought of returning made bile rise in her throat . Her discomfort vanished when Leesil 's smile faded . He rose up in the bed . " If she lives ? What does that- ? " Magiere quickly covered his lips with her fingers as she sat up . " I did n't mean it that way . I want to believe as much as you ... but I had a mother , as well , and a past neither of us knows . I need answers , too . " Twice they 'd been manipulated into battles with the undead . The last time they fought , in the king 's city of Bela , had left them both with more questions than answers . Magiere learned more of her nature-dhampir , hunter of the dead-in being coerced into ridding Bela of its undead predators . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought an ally , revealed himself as a Noble Dead akin to the ones he 'd pitted her against . He 'd staged the encounters to train her for his own purpose in acquiring an unknown artifact supposedly guarded by ancient Noble Dead . Welstiel had been less than forthcoming or even knowledgeable about her origin , but his actions stirred Magiere 's desire to know . Leesil 's eyes betrayed a twinge of dismay as he looked at her . " No ... no . " He shook his head . " It 's been too many years- " " Please , listen , " Magiere cut in . " This is n't just for me , but for both of us . There 's so much we do n't know about my past compared to yours . " " And we 'll get answers , " he said , " but the living come first . " " I was n't made by the living ! " she snapped . " An undead used my mother to make me-to kill its own kind . I need to know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him made Magiere calm herself before continuing . " Before we can head north through the Warlands and beyond to the elven territory , we must travel eastward and inland , around the Gulf of Belaski . That 's halfway to Droevinka and my past , so close to my answers and less than a third the distance we will travel north . " She put her hands upon Leesil 's cheeks and leaned in close until her forehead touched his . When she lifted her head again , he stared downward , not looking at her . His expression softened as his hand slid down her cheek , her long neck , and across her breastbone , and finally gripped her hand . " All right , it makes sense . If my mother is alive after all this time , likely she 's in no danger . It makes no odds if we take a little longer to reach her . " Magiere scooted forward and wrapped herself around him , flesh to flesh , and held him . He understood , but it made her feel no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear , " she whispered in his ear , " once we learn what we can for me , we 'll hurry north for your mother . " She pulled back enough to look into his sad but resolved eyes . Although she spoke calmly , the scope of their impending journey left her feeling small and lost . He was about to answer when the thud of a door and running feet echoed from somewhere out front in the inn , and footsteps grew louder . " The innkeeper is up and about , " Magiere said , wanting to push away the outside world a bit longer . Leesil shifted her out of his lap and reached for his breeches as he swung his legs over the bed 's side . " No , " he said . " It 's probably- " The little room 's door burst open and slammed against the wall . " Magiere ... Leesil ! I 'm coming with you ! " Wynn cried out , and she twisted the latch and shoved the door open with both hands . " Domin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck the wall , Wynn Hygeorht , apprentice for the Belaskian branch of the Guild of Sagecraft , stopped cold . All her excitement drained away . Leesil clutched a blanket as he grabbed for his breeches , his wiry torso dark gold in the candlelight . Startled , Magiere jerked the blanket back over her own specterlike body . The blanket snapped from Leesil 's hand , and he lost his grip on the trousers , as well . His amber eyes widened , and Wynn 's cheeks flushed as all thought scurried from her mind . Leesil stood before her , stark naked . " Oh ... , " Wynn stammered . " Oh ... " The door recoiled from the wall and struck her shoulder , and Wynn stumbled back into the opening . A low grunt made her glance down long enough to see Chap standing beside her . A few burrs and twigs stuck in the dog 's long silver-gray fur , and his crystalline eyes widened as he looked into the room . Wynn lifted her head again , and embarrassment overwhelmed all good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still clutching the blanket as she stood up . " With all that learning , did n't those sages teach you to knock ? " With a sudden inhalation , Wynn slapped her hands over her eyes at the sight of an exposed Leesil and an incensed Magiere heading straight for her . In less time than it took to announce her presence , she had lost the good graces of everyone she intended to join on the coming journey . How much worse could this possibly become ? " Get out ! " Magiere snarled . Wynn fumbled for the doorframe , too mortified to open her eyes . Two large paws thumped against her rear , and she stumbled into hallway . She heard the door slam shut behind her as she caught herself on the passage 's far wall . When she turned about to peek between her fingers , Chap sat before the closed door . His translucent blue eyes were filled with something akin to an elder 's disappointment . Wynn slid down the wall to slump upon the floor . " You should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , unblinking . His expression was too much like that of an old master sage waiting for a slow pupil to see the obvious answer to a stupid question . Wynn stared back at the closed door . " Oh , my , " she groaned . Chap grunted and licked his nose . " Oh , be quiet , " Wynn snapped . Leesil belted on his breeches and pulled his shirt over his head . " Well , now neither of us has any secrets from Wynn . " " You knew she was coming , " Magiere said in the same biting tone she 'd used on Wynn . Leesil saw the accusing wrinkle of Magiere 's brow as her own white shirt dropped around her neck . It was difficult to decide which response would spare him the worst of her coming assault . An uncovered lie would be dangerous later , but so was the truth in the moment . Looking at Magiere 's uncanny beauty , at her black hair loose over her shoulders , and her pale face and dark eyes , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd thought their previous night together could never have happened . As much as Leesil adored her challenging nature , and even goaded it at times to watch her smolder , this was n't the time for another clash with Magiere . And worse , with the lingering memory of her pressed against him , he could n't think of a convincing lie . " Yes , I knew , " he admitted . " I gave Wynn a necklace to sell , and she 's brought us the coins from it . " " Necklace ? What necklace ? Leesil , what did you- ? " " I took it from Sapphire 's body before we burned her corpse in Bela . We 've a long way to go , and we 're not going to get there on your bad temper and my charm . " He jerked the door open before she could come at him again . Chap sat before the open door , his tail thumping . Wynn slumped against the far wall , her face buried in her hands . Barely twenty years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shoulder , and the sage 's traditional long gray robe had been replaced with a shorter one that hung to the thighs of her new breeches . Her little hands slid down from her eyes and she peeked up at Leesil , her olive cheeks flushed , and she covered her face again . " You two get in here , " Leesil ordered . Chap trotted in , and , at the sight of Magiere 's stern expression , he slipped past the travel chest and out of the way . Wynn entered more slowly . " I am so truly sorry , " she whispered . Magiere crossed her arms . Leesil tensed as he shut the door , waiting to see if she would continue with him or turn her ire elsewhere . " What 's this nonsense about coming with us ? " she snapped at Wynn . " You 're supposed to be on your way to Miiska with our payment from Bela 's city council . " Leesil and Magiere had been well paid for their services . Wynn had promised to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karlin explaining their plans and other matters . " Domin Tilswith will go in my place , " Wynn blurted , plainly relieved that her poor manners seemed forgotten . " Your town council can begin building the community warehouse . He asked me to travel with you to the elven territory and serve as your translator . The elves here are different from those of my continent , so reclusive and secretive , and- " " You 're not coming with us , " Leesil cut in , astonished . Wynn was little more than a sparrow barely out of its mother 's nest-too innocent and naive to get involved in what he and Magiere did n't fully understand . " Now , did you sell the necklace I gave you ? " The young sage stood silent . With only a brief hesitation , she frowned , pulled a pouch from her robe 's pocket , and handed it to him . Leesil looked into it and found a fistful of coins , half gold and half silver , and mostly sovereigns . It was more than enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped . " I received a good price for it-and I am coming with you , " Wynn said . " Domin Tilswith assisted you both more than once and gave you shelter in Bela . He wishes me to- " " I doubt it was his idea , " Magiere scoffed . " We have other more immediate plans , " Leesil said . " And when we do turn toward the elven territory , it may well be winter . Wynn , you are n't fit for such a journey , and we do n't have time to coddle a scholar on the road . " Wynn straightened her back , head up , embarrassment replaced by stubborn indignation . Leesil had seen this more than once during their time in Bela . " And how will you get your answers ? " she asked . Continues ...
