DANIEL IS N'T TALKING MARTI LEIMBACH <P> Melanie Marsh knows something is wrong with her son Daniel . He wo n't let go of his Thomas the Tank Engine train . He walks on his toes and collects objects , especially anything disk shaped . And he is n't talking . When the diagnosis comes  --  Daniel is autistic  --  Melanie 's very proper English husband Stephen walks out , leaving her to feel her way forward with only a mysterious child and an army of ( mostly ) unhelpful doctors to guide her . This is a tearful , joyful novel , and Leimbach ( Dying Young ) comes by tears and joy honestly : she has an autistic son . <P> FISHSCALE GHOSTFACE KILLAH <P> The Wu-Tang Clan 's last reliably great member has n't exactly softened his material ( fishscale is apparently slang for uncut cocaine ) , but then he has n't lost his ability to tell a story either . In Ghostface 's dexterous delivery , a line like " Workin ' out , all I curl is my index finger " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of paranoia . The production puts equal value on melody and tension and even has room for nostalgia  --  9 Milli Bros. is a Wu-Tang reunion  --  but the truth is that Ghostface is better on his own . <P> THE COMPLETE MR . ARKADIN ORSON WELLES <P> " Will you let me tell it in my own way ? " begs the tough-guy narrator ( Robert Arden ) of this 1955 crime drama . Alas , neither he nor Welles  --  the film 's star , writer and director  --  got his wish . Arkadin was taken from Welles , its convoluted form ironed out and the result renamed Confidential Report . At least seven versions of the film exist , none to his specifications . This superb Criterion DVD pack offers three variations , including a new " complete " assembly . In any form , it 's a rococo mix of Citizen Kane and The Third Man : a study of a rich man 's power and isolation amid the seedy , greedy flotsam of postwar Europe . In a way , this is a do-it-yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the real Arkadin  --  a film that is its own Rosebud . <P> BROMWELL HIGH BBC AMERICA , THURSDAYS , 11:30 P.M. E.T . <P> South Park meets Zadie Smith 's White Teeth in this offensive , riotous cartoon about a multicultural high school in South London . The trio of main characters includes scheming , crude Keisha ( imagine a black female Eric Cartman ) ; Natella , the earnest South Asian class brain ; and Latrina , the bigoted white working-class bombshell . Like many good satires , Bromwell is rooted in the idea that shallowness and venality transcend color and creed . The faculty ranges from an assortment of Anglo ignoramuses to Iqbal , the greedy , sleazy Middle Eastern headmaster . And when the immigrant students discuss their favorite foods and cultural activities for a diversity-day assembly , they all choose KFC and text messaging . Bromwell is a rude cannonball splash into the 21st century melting pot .
