September 3 , 2006 <p> The water in the bucket was meant for the tomatoes . As it cascaded instead over the tousled head and shirtless torso of her husband , Holly felt her knees wobble . She 'd been watching him from the parlor window for a few minutes now , still amused after two and a half years that her city boy had taken so enthusiastically to life in the Virginia sticks . The vegetable garden had been all his idea . Tomatoes , squash , onions , corn , peas , and four varieties of chili peppers received his intense devotion every evening when he got home ; on Sundays like this one he spent hours out back , babying anything that needed extra attention . <p> Yep  --  scratch an Irishman , find a peasant . She grinned to herself . He made quite the bucolic picture in the noonday heat : six feet four inches of summer-tanned Pocahontas County sheriff , wearing frayed old cutoffs and a pair of sneakers , with a battered Yankees cap pulled low over his forehead to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thin stalk of hay sticking out from between his teeth . <p> When he took off the cap and stretched wide , her laughter faded ; when he reached for the water bucket , the shift of muscle in strong arms and long back brought a little whimper to her throat . Now , with water gliding down his chest and belly , heat curled low in her abdomen and she leaned a little more heavily on the windowsill in deference to her shaky knees . <p> After a moment she unlatched the screen , pushed it open , and called out , " Hey , farmboy ! " <p> Evan squinted , using both hands to rake back the wet hair dripping into his eyes . The gesture flexed chest , arms , and shoulders to noteworthy effect ; he knew it , too , damn him . The grin he gave her made him look half his forty-two years . Holly gulped . <p> " Yes , ma'am ? " <p> " Do n't you think it 's time you took a breather ? " Breathing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Sounds mighty nice , ma'am , " he drawled in his atrocious version of her native accent . " Pardon for askin ' , but y'all would n't happen to be one of them desperate house wives I hear tell about , would you ? " <p> Yeah , he knew what he was doing , all right : knuckles propped just above the low-riding waistband , hips and head in a speculative tilt . Holly 's thoughts turned to pillage and plunder  --  and she 'd do it right in the middle of the crookneck squash if she had to . As he showed off a few more moves with an artfully artless scratch to the small of his back , she pretended to consider his question . " Now that y'all mention it . . . " His answering grin was entirely too smug . So , resting one shoulder against the window frame , she folded her arms beneath her breasts . Instant cleavage . Fairly impressive cleavage , too ; becoming the primary milk wagon for twins could do that . <p> His turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rat bastard  --  and said , " Shucks , ma'am , kinda depends on how desperate we 're talkin ' here . " <p> Holly repressed a sardonic snort . Evan Lachlan and hard to get were mutually exclusive terms . She hiked the skirt of her cotton sundress up her thighs , hitched herself sideways to sit in the window , and slung one bare leg over the ledge . Dangling her foot , scraping the soft dirt of a flower bed with her toes , she told herself that if the cleavage and the naked leg did n't get him over here within the next thirty seconds , she would go with her original pillage-and-plunder plan , and the squash could damned well fend for itself . Evan cleared his throat and took a couple of involuntary steps toward her . She hid a smirk . Gotcha ! " Y'all got any ideas , farmboy ? " <p> " One or two , " he allowed . The self-confident saunter was back , signaling a tweak in the balance of power . " I 'm all sweaty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest as if embarrassed by his scruffiness . " And there you are , all pretty and sweet . . . . " <p> She heard herself growl . She heard him chuckle . She came out of the window like a tackle going for a quarterback sack . <p> The crookneck squash never had a chance . <p> MUCH LATER , after a change of venue upstairs to their bedroom , Evan hummed low in his throat as Holly 's fingertips stroked his shoulder . His wife knew every one of his buttons and exactly how to push them ; the thing was that she never pushed them in the same order . Systematic sequential insanity on a regular basis he could have handled , no sweat . But Holly was way too creative for that . He felt a corner of his mouth twitch , knowing how many husbands would give their left nut to have this problem , and tightened his arms around her . <p> " You have the most amazing skin , " she mused drowsily , hand drifting down his chest . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch her fingers before they reached the center of his breastbone . He was n't quick enough . <p> "  --  except for the scar that 's my fault . " <p> Lachlan was quiet for a long moment , spreading his hand over Holly 's on his chest . He did n't try to see her face ; he knew she would n't look at him . Not that he blamed her ; his own mind seemed all bruises whenever he tried to think about that night . Finally , he murmured , " We do n't talk much about it , do we ? " <p> " I know . " <p> " Three years this Hallowe'en . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " It was n't your fault . I know damned well I 've said that before . I 've got a scar . You did n't put it there . " He waited , but she was n't talking . " Holly , I 'm alive because of  --  " Something occurred to him , and he drew away from her , turning onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow ? " <p> " Evan ? " She met his gaze , frowning . <p> " I never did ask you why I 'm still breathing . What you said about how if I ever raised a hand to you again , you 'd kill me  --  " <p> " We avoid talking about that night , too , " she muttered . <p> " At the Hyacinths , " he persisted , " I did n't just raise my hand to you . I put a gun to your chest . " <p> He did n't know whether he was more grateful or exasperated when she tried on a mile  --  not a very good fit  --  and said , " I thought you were supposed to have amnesia about all that . Or did you forget ? To have amnesia , I mean  --  " <p> " Knock it off . You know what I 'm talking about . " <p> Relenting , she bit her lower lip , then said , " It was n't you . " <p> " Part of it was . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  Evan , I watched it , I saw it come toward you and  --  and merge with you . But it was n't you that night  --  either of those nights . " <p> " Is that what you 've been telling yourself this whole time ? " <p> " What have you been telling yourself ? " <p> He lay back flat again and stared at the ceiling . " That I have to be careful . I always knew that . We 've talked about my parents before . We both know I have a temper . If  --  " <p> " I have a temper , too . " <p> " Ya think ? " He smiled briefly , but did n't look at her . " You do n't have a family history like mine . If I ever hit you  --  or one of the kids  --  " <p> " Never . " <p> " I know you 're sure , Holly . I ca n't be . I can never be sure . " <p> " What does that mean ? That you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? Listen to me , a chuisle . The one time , you 'd been drunk for a week and you were in martyr mode  --  " <p> " You really want to go there ? " he asked softly . <p> " No . " Holly took a deep breath . " The other time , you were loaded half out of your skull on that incense stuff to begin with , and then Noel 's little playmate came along . I saw it happen , and I was cold sober . You were n't . Not either of those times . Do you remember anything about what happened ? " <p> " Some . Not much . " He considered for a moment . " I never knew the flowers on my mother 's dress were hyacinths , that day I saw her with the priest . That 's what I saw , all those goddamned purple flowers  --  only it was you wearing the dress . How did Noel do that ? What did he tap into ? " <p> " I do n't know . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shifting against him , she went on , " We 've both had nightmares about it . " <p> " Yeah . I can always tell , because those are the ones you wo n't talk about . " <p> " And who does this remind us of ? My point is that I actually remember both those nights , and you do n't , so you 're just gon na have to trust me on this , husband mine . " <p> " I am , huh ? " He turned his head and eyed her grimly determined face . " Does that mean you 're gon na have to trust me about the scar ? That it was n't your fault ? " <p> " Oh , clever man ! " she snarled  --  but her heart was n't really in it . " Got me that time , did n't you ? " " Yep , " he agreed , unrepentant . Holly sulked for a moment , then settled into his arms once more . " It still does n't negate the fact that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't think we want to go there , either . " " Just be glad we survived it , and move on ? " she suggested . " It 's worked so far . " She kissed his throat by way of apology . " I ca n't help it . I analyze . " " And you 're only turning analytical about us because you 're not writing a book right now . " She groaned elaborately . " Do n't remind me . " " You 'll find something . You got ta admit you 've been a little busy . " <p> Time for a change of subject , he told himself . " Speaking of the offspring , are you sure Lulah 's okay with us stashing them with her all afternoon ? " <p> " And tonight . " <p> " That gawdawful politicking party . I 'd forgotten . " <p> His grimace gained him no sympathy . " Democracy in action , Sheriff honey . " <p> " I 'm still not clear on why I actually have to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pretty much runs Pocahontas County , does n't it ? " <p> " For the last three and a half centuries , " she confirmed . <p> " So  --  ? " he prompted . <p> " Cousin Jesse was duly elected every four years . You 're an interim <p> appointment so he could retire  --  and , not incidentally , give folks a chance to get to know you and what a staggeringly brilliant law enforcement officer you are . But you still have to be elected . " <p> " And again I ask : why ? " " And again I reply : democracy in action . Labor Day is the traditional start of the campaigning season  --  something I wish anybody running for <p> president would remember , " she added crossly . " They seem to think everybody in this country really , truly wants to spend two solid years listening to them yammer . " <p> " I 'm no politician , " he groused . " I do n't do the grip-and-grin thing . " <p> " It 's free food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't we just skip it ? That place makes me twitchy . Do n't tell me I 'm being weird  --  Lulah does n't like it , either , and for reasons other than you 'd think . " <p> Many and many a year ago , Lulah McClure and Jesse McNichol had cleaned out a houseful of neo-Nazis who had taken over the old Neville mansion . The magical decontamination had taken many days and enough spells to fill a fair- sized grimoire . They had n't known about Holly back then ; unaware that she was a Spellbinder , and that her blood would seal any Work they did , they 'd had to return again and again to take care of lingering nasties . One would think that the place had been scoured clean . But Evan got the creeps whenever he even drove past the new wrought iron gates marking the entrance to the access road  --  and he did n't have a speck of magic in him . <p> Westmoreland , named ( though misspelled , as generations of the truly pedantic had pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed was in his ancestry before emigration to Virginia , had once spread across a thousand acres . Now it was reduced to about twenty , the rest having been sold off as the Neville fortunes waned . Since they had abandoned the place , back in the ' 40s , it had changed hands many times  --  and languished vacant and deteriorating for many years . There had been some talk in the ' 90s of using it as a field project for the archaeology department of the University of Virginia , digs at old plantations  --  especially the slave quarters  --  having yielded fascinating finds elsewhere . A preliminary survey was done , and the engineering students had just ascertained that the central staircase , the walls on either side , the vast cellar , and the back of the house were as sound as the day they 'd been finished  --  when a chimney suddenly collapsed , almost on top of their professor . So much for that plan . In March of 2004 it had been purchased by a German businessman who had turned it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an architectural horror would result . Contractors and craftsmen were imported from outside Pocahontas County  --  partly because almost everybody in the construction business who lived in the vicinity had been hired to refurbish and expand the old overseer 's house at Woodhush . It was n't until Westmoreland was completed that county residents got a look at it : an extravagant grand opening party that November had introduced the new Westmoreland Inn and its owner , Bernhardt Weiss . <p> Not as readily seduced by his kitchen or his wine list as he might have wished , PoCo residents nevertheless admitted , more or less grudgingly , that the Inn was an acceptable successor to the antebellum mansion . Greek columns , gracious portico , grand staircase , great wraparound verandah  --  everything about the house , with its eighteen guest suites and huge ballroom and muraled dining room , was just an eyelash shy of excessive , just a whisker away from overkill . <p> Herr Weiss had saved that sort of thing for the Spa . <p> If the house was Greek Revival , the spa facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could even get as classically oiled-and-strigiled as if one were at the Baths of Caracalla , although this turned out to be only a rumor . <p> Since the grand opening event , Evan had n't set foot on the property . Holly and Lulah , taking advantage of the certificates handed out at the party , had spent a whole day getting massaged , facialed , manicured , pedicured , moisturized , exfoliated , and waxed . Holly reported a lovely experience  --  while teasing Evan that without at least one spa afternoon at Westmoreland , his New York Metrosexual credentials would expire . But Lulah agreed with Evan : the place was creepy . Further , she told him privately , the whole time there she 'd felt blind . <p> Other men in the county admitted to the occasional massage , and more readily to using the state-of-the-art gymnasium . This was the one reason Evan might have considered driving the long spur road to Westmoreland again ; relaxational farming , the occasional horseback venture , and intermittent jogging kept him not quite in shape . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd been doing this weekend , he 'd be able to toss the t-shirt his snide little sister had sent him last Christmas : This is NOT a beer belly . This is protective camouflage for my rock-hard abs . <p> As often happened , especially when they were physically close like this , Holly picked up on his thoughts . She rubbed a hand across his stomach and grinned at him . " I keep telling you : I 'll ogle Brad Pitt 's perfect pecs any day of the week , but who wants to cuddle up to a marble statue ? " <p> Lachlan snorted . " So I should n't get all crazy jealous of your old boyfriend ? " Who was n't quite as sculpted as Brad Pitt , but certainly came close . <p> " Only if it amuses you . And I 've told you before , he was never a boyfriend . " <p> He stared at her . " You never did it ? " <p> " No . " <p> Evan began to laugh . " Oh , that poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looks at you ! " <p> " How does he look at me ? " <p> " You would n't understand . It 's a Guy Thing . " <p> " Whatever . " She dismissed the incomprehensibility with a wave of her hand . " What I want to know is why we 're discussing some other man when I 've got you naked as a jaybird and ready for more ? " <p> " Who said I 'm  --  " When she gave him a slow , lascivious grin , every nerve below his waist started chanting her name . " Christ , woman , are you trying to kill me ? " <p> " Time I ' fessed up , huh ? I 'm after the insurance money . " <p> " Why do n't you take that smart mouth of yours and do something useful with it ? " When she did , he exclaimed , " You are gon na kill me ! " <p> " Trust me , lover man  --  you wo n't mind . " <p> " FOUR- THIRTY . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the curve of Evan 's neck . " No . " <p> " C'm on . If we 're going to this stupid thing  --  " <p> " No . " His skin was warm and smooth , smelling of sweat and sex and the jasmine and marjoram their sheets were folded in , and she did n't want to leave here , ever . <p> " Whatever happened to ' democracy in action ' ? " He poked her ungently in the ribs . " I 've already thought of all the smart remarks you could make about the action in here , so do n't bother . " <p> Groaning , she rolled out of bed and grabbed a shirt Evan had dropped on a chair yesterday  --  or maybe the day before . A housekeeper she was n't . " Have I mentioned lately that you 're an asshole ? " <p> " Ah ! " He wagged an admonishing finger . " Five bucks  --  pay up . " <p> " We 're allowed to swear in our bedroom , " she protested . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule because otherwise , as Lulah had acidly observed , the twins ' first words would undoubtedly have been unprintable . The hefty fine had been Lulah 's idea as well : financial motivation . For about six months the gallon pickle jar in the kitchen had rapidly filled with portraits of Abraham Lincoln , and the twins ' college fund thrived . But it was rare these days that Holly or Evan slipped around the children . <p> " Door 's open , " he reminded her sweetly . " Five bucks . " <p> " They 're not even in the house ! " Padding over to the closet , she started rummaging for clothes . She was Sheriff 's Wife tonight , not Bestselling Author , so nothing backless , strapless , or cut halfway down to Argentina . Besides , there was a tropical storm plowing its way to the Virginia coastline , which meant rain here in the Blue Ridge by midnight or so , which meant a jacket for later . <p> " Okay , then , " Evan was saying . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me shoes . " <p> Distracted from sartorial musings , she turned an incredulous stare on him . " The what ? " <p> " You know  --  the choo-choos or the blah-blahs or whatever the hell they are . The stiletto things , with the straps . The Fuck Me shoes . " <p> " It 's Jimmy Choo and Manolo Blahnik , you ignorant lout . And I 'm assuming you mean these . " She held up six hundred bucks ' worth of snakeskin sandals with four-inch heels . They were three years out of fashion ; had this been New York she would have culled them from her closet long ago . Or maybe not ; her husband liked them , and she was ludicrously indulgent of his whims . <p> He stretched wide , eyeing her and the shoes . " Too bad you ca n't wear just those and that shirt . There 's nothing sexier in the world than a woman wearing stilettos , a man 's shirt  --  and nothing else . " <p> " Sorry , darlin ' . The county sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? Not indecent exposure . Everything 's covered . " <p> " I know the guy , and I 'm sure he 'd think of something . " <p> " You could probably bribe him . " His arching eyebrows and innocent grin told her exactly what the county sheriff had in mind by way of a payoff . <p> While he showered , she searched her closet in earnest . There was still a whole section of her pre-pregnancy wardrobe she could n't have squeezed into with a can of axle grease and a crowbar . Evan did n't seem to mind this more voluptuous version of his wife , so she shrugged it off , reasoning that any woman of forty-something who expected to have the body she 'd had at twenty- something was out of her mind anyhow . Besides , as Lulah had remarked , " Anytime past thirty-five , you might as well enjoy what you look like now , because in five years you 're gon na look worse . " <p> The annoying exception was her husband , Holly mused . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years ago . It was nothing she could put her finger on  --  or , rather , it was everything she put her fingers on whenever she got the chance . <p> " What 're you grinning about ? " <p> Startled , she dropped the skirt she 'd chosen and turned quickly . He stood in the bathroom doorway with a beard made of soap , a straight razor in his hand , a towel around his hips , and a quizzical look in his eyes . <p> She considered leering , considered what leering usually led to , and shook her head . " Never mind . Let 's stop off and kiss the kids before we head over , okay ? " <p> " Sure . Hey , you wan na grab that long- sleeved t-shirt out of the drawer for me ? " <p> " No . " Holly slid past him into the bathroom . <p> " What , you got two broken arms ? " <p> " No black tonight . You ca n't wear the cashmere jacket , either . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " But you always tell me I look hot in the cashmere jacket . " <p> " You do . Just not tonight . " <p> He pondered . " Oh . Too in-your-face New York , huh ? " <p> " Not even in the same league as the Yankees jersey , " she teased , and he gave the predictable groan . " It 's just that we want people to come up and talk to you , not ask if you want a Zoloft . " <p> " If we do n't get out of this party by ten , I 'm gon na need a Zoloft . " <p> Fifteen minutes later , he was dressed in dark-wash Levi 's , white shirt , and leather jacket . And , of course , those miserable old ostrich-hide cowboy boots . Despite the casual outfit , despite two years as sheriff of the smallest county in Virginia  --  even despite the cowboy boots  --  New York was scrawled all over him . It always would be . He needed a haircut , and he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , and the boots should have completed the picture of Sunday-go-to-meetin ' rural chic . But he was instantly identifiable as a New Yorker , as unmistakably as Americans were tagged as such in a single glance by Europeans . It was n't just the clothes  --  his shirt a shadow- striped silk that fit him to perfection , his jacket tailored to within an inch of its life notwithstanding the fact that it was battered brown leather . It was the way he wore the clothes , the way complete contentment fused with complete confidence  --  plus an intriguing insinuation of power . Nothing could intimidate him , nothing could scare him . He 'd spent most of his life in the greatest city in the world , and more than fifteen years as a law enforcement officer in that city . Deposit him stark naked smack in the middle of Buenos Aires , Bialystok , or Borneo , and New York would still gaze arrogantly from his eyes . <p> " You 're staring again , " he remarked as he strapped on his wristwatch and snagged up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is unexpected , " she mocked . <p> " Back at you , lady love , " he chuckled . " Except the skirt 's too long . " <p> " No miniskirts after age forty . " <p> " And there are how many precincts of fashion police in this county ? Turn around . " <p> She obediently twirled on her toes so that the tulip hem of her skirt flared around her knees . " Okay ? " she prompted , knowing very well that the apple green silk dress was a winner  --  even if it had come from a catalog instead of Barneys , and even if it was n't hemmed halfway to her ass . <p> " Oh , very okay . " He tucked his Glock into the shoulder holster beneath his left arm . " Married or not , girl , you 're going home with me tonight . " <p> " Pretty sure of yourself , are n't you ? " <p> " Nah , " he replied breezily , catching her by the waist and pulling her in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Excerpted from Fire Raiser by Melanie Rawn . Copyright 2009 by Melanie Rawn .
