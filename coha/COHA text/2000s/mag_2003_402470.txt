True , half of Americans are seriously overweight , but many of us are in the gray area , or we imagine we 're fat . Whether they show on the scale or not , the extra pounds take their toll , physically and emotionally . Herewith , a full menu of stories to give you some perspective on obesity , to rid you of the notion that deprivation works and to help you nurture your body and feed your soul while achieving your best , most healthful weight . OUR FEAR OF OBESITY Even if you 're struggling with just three pounds , trying to achieve perfection can be a heavy burden . BY DIANE GUERNSEY // For countless women , fear of fat , food and eating is a fact of life . And small wonder . To be slender , even bony , is part of the ( mostly unspoken ) imperative that a woman look flawless from her shining hair to her Gucci pumps . And the higher up the socioeconomic ladder she rises , the more intense the pressure : all too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the tangible proof that she 's mastered her body 's inconvenient appetites and achieved society 's most exacting standards of perfection . Trying to meet this ideal is difficult enough , but the real problem starts when normal caution about overindulgence shades into fear of appetite-and , by extension , of food itself . Self-restraint slips into self-denial or even self-loathing ( witness Texas dentist Clara Harris 's desperate attempts to " perfect " her body in response to her husband 's sneering criticisms-before she finally murdered him for cheating on her and got a twenty-year sentence ) . For many women , it seems , the only solution to the fear of fat lies in a militant regulation of their food intake . " My attitude toward food is not obsession , but it 's not far off , " says Muffie Potter Aston , the socially prominent wife of Manhattan plastic surgeon Sherrell Aston . " I am religious about what I eat . I start the day with a bowl of sliced cantaloupe , three apricots and three prunes ; then I go to the gym . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For many people like Aston , this soldierly rigor works , but for others it can lead to joyless hypervigilance , spasms of rebellious overindulgence or an eating disorder ( see " Weight Obsession , " page 115 ) . The same holds for commercial blockbuster diets that advocate reducing your consumption to starvation levels or sweeping whole food groups off your plate . After all , the occasional spoonful of creme brulee nurtures the soul . How can you strike a balance between healthy discipline and wholehearted indulgence ? The answer , say a growing number of experts , lies in designing a personalized plan , one that allows for the pleasures of food , incorporates exercise and sound nutrition and reflects your individual need for more or less structure . ( This strategy will need fine-tuning as you age ; see " Combating Toxic Weight , " page 111 . ) While some women prefer to pursue a weight-control program on their own , others find the support of professionals ( physicians , nutritionists ) , family members or friends essential ( see " Which Diets Work ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vital to avoid the extremes of self-deprecation ( " I was n't even hungry , and I still ate that slice of Brie " ) and total abandon ( " I can eat as much as I want , whenever I want " ) . The goal is not self-annihilation but self-nurturing , ultimately leading to good health and possibly preventing heart disease and various cancers that have been linked to excess weight . Granted , it takes tremendous resolve to create and maintain this moderate lifestyle , but so does nixing creme brulee forever . The reward is rich indeed : finding a way of eating , and living , that eases the fear of fat and satisfies body and soul . There I was , fifty-three years old and , like many American women , facing the fact that my weight was creeping up with every passing year . An avid runner from the age of twenty-three and a food writer since turning thirty-one , I had always hoped , even assumed , that my passion for running would offset any damage done at the dinner table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my weight a lot-the scale read 180 pounds by the end of 1999-and although I was running longer distances , and more often , I was getting nowhere . I began to believe that my size-16 frame was inevitable , given my age and my work as a cookbook author , cooking teacher and restaurant critic for The International Herald Tribune , where I have worked since moving to Paris in 1980 . Then I was talked into celebrating a friend 's birthday at the Golden Door , a spa near San Diego . I went along in January 2000 to be a good sport , but I certainly did not anticipate any life-changing epiphany . How wrong I was . It turned out that while I had plenty of motivation , I did not have the information I needed to lose the weight and keep it off , or to get fit and stay fit . The Door did . By putting in hours of hard work and heeding the advice of trainer Mike Bee and other specialists at the Door , I lost six and a half pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with even greater motivation and discipline-combined with lots of jogging-lost a total of thirty-six pounds in seven months . Since that first visit , I have returned to the Door twice a year . Each time , my weight inches downward , my strength builds , and I leave with a specific , attainable new goal . I am now forty pounds lighter than I was before my initial orientation at the spa . None of this would have happened without small but dramatic changes leading me toward an approach known as attuned eating . After my first stay at the Door , I examined my eating patterns and determined that it was not the three-star-restaurant meals that were making me fat , but many seemingly innocent day-to-day indulgences : a single nibble of cheese that turned into three or four nibbles at about five in the afternoon ; that extra glass of wine at the end of the day ; a second helping of anything . I needed a permanent lifestyle change , in diet as well as in exercise . And I needed a program that I could follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not about skipping meals , using diet aids , counting calories obsessively or depriving yourself . To practice it means to learn , or relearn , the " art " of being in touch with your body 's appetite signals instead of relying on external cues . It means eating only when you 're hungry , and then mindfully ( see " Which Diets Work ? " page 113 ) , without letting stress , emotional issues , social pressures or insane schedules drive you to eat more . Food is not meant to be a punishment , reward or crutch , but simply fuel ; and eating , a pleasurable ritual . I have integrated the following attuned-eating concepts into my daily life . Changing Your Ways The first time I visited the Door , the nutritionist taught me the importance of creating new habits . I discovered that if I did n't give in to the afternoon nibble of cheese for twenty-five to thirty-five consecutive days , on the thirty-sixth day I did n't even consider that old ritual an option . Believe me , it . works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eating habits , I realized that for most of my life I ate until I was full ( instead of satisfied ) . That seemed normal . During the past three years , I 've rarely eaten until I became full , and when I have , I 've felt uncomfortable . Setting Small but Attainable Goals Before spending time at the Door , I had been goal-oriented but had n't realized how important it-was to break down a huge objective into little parts-for example , losing five pounds in a month or getting into a favorite pair of slacks . Set your sights too high and you 're likely to fail . Sticking to It Attuned eating calls for mindfulness every day . That does not mean depriving yourself of foods you love , but it does involve finding the discipline to be attentive to your body 's signals on a daily basis . Maintaining the Pleasure Factor I have always had a good relationship with food and considered eating a joy . I 've never connected guilt with eating , and I know that if I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie low the next . Since moving to Paris , I have adopted the French commitment to moderation . While Americans eat every meal as though it were their last , the French know that the slice of foie gras or extra piece of chocolate cake will be there tomorrow . These days , I enjoy food more than ever . Because I make sure that every bite I take counts-especially in terms of pleasure-I find that I can easily reject foods that I know wo n't really satisfy me . ( In fact , I get downright cranky when faced with a tasteless meal or a disappointing glass of wine . ) I approach each meal with a sense of anticipation and a good bit of hunger , so my palate is clearer and food seems more flavorful . As a food writer , I can stretch the enjoyment beyond the table : writing about what I have eaten allows me to relive the delight , as does describing a meal to a friend . As for exercise , I realized that I had to do more than run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I trained for a marathon I never ran because of constant injuries . ) Today I have a toy chest full of options for workouts . Depending on my mood and schedule , I run outdoors or on a treadmill ; ride my mountain bike ; use an elliptical trainer , free weights or a cable machine ; and walk everywhere I can . And it is the dailiness of the exercise that is important . Day in and day out for the rest of my life . I have retooled favorite recipes to make them lighter and integrated special fitness weeks into the roster of cooking classes I teach at my farmhouse in Provence . During these two-week sessions , in addition to the regular daily activities-hands-on cooking classes ; visits to markets , vineyards and local restaurants-we hike and do pool workouts . I would be a liar if I sugarcoated the past three years . There were many moments when I was convinced that no amount of attuned eating or working out would budge the scale . There were those miserable weeks of injury during which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book tours and eating trips or travel days when food options ranged from over-the-top to awful . But the good days have outweighed the bad . And the bonuses never stop . There 's the great feeling I have all day after a good workout , increased flexibility , constant compliments on how I look and an understanding that I 'm doing all I can to live a good , long , healthy life . You 've been there ( serious dieting ) and done that ( repeatedly ) . So you know that , in the long run , most diets do n't work . Americans spend at least $40 billion a year on diet products and programs , and only 2 to 5 percent lose weight permanently . The average dieter winds up heavier afterward . You know why this happens . Any program that severely restricts calories and food choices also slows your metabolism , so weight drops off more grudgingly and reappears more quickly with each try . The physical and emotional stress of dieting lowers your brain 's serotonin levels , muddling your body 's full/empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of Feeding the Hungry Heart ( Plume ) , says , " For every diet , there is an equal and opposite binge . " You may have tried prescription drugs like phentermine , Topamax or Zonegran to combat diet-induced cravings . But if you 're like most women , you shy away from their potential side effects . Perhaps you 've tried hypnosis or acupressure . Or you simply prefer a do-it-yourself approach to weight loss . You also know that , although obesity savages your self-esteem , so does a failed diet . " Once you break a diet , you believe that you 're someone who can not be trusted with food , " says Wendy Oliver-Pyatt , M.D. , author of Fed Up ! The Breakthrough Ten-Step , No-Diet Fitness Plan ( Contemporary Books ) . " You end up eating for emotional reasons , not from physical hunger . You gain weight ; then you 're filled with fear , guilt and anxiety . " Oliver-Pyatt advocates " mindful eating , " a self-trusting , nonpunitive approach whose principles echo those of the decades-old school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weight , " page 111 ) : to eat only when you 're hungry , to identify which emotions spur nonhungry eating , to seek support through individual or group therapy . Over time , this enables women to retool their eating patterns ; some also lose weight . The Diet Dilemma You may feel you 'd do better starting with more structure . Most successful losers achieve their goals through a personalized plan , not a cookie-cutter approach . Many women do so by attending a reputable clinic or spa ( see " Word of Mouth on the Best Treatment Centers and Spas , " page 116 ) ; another good choice is Weight Watchers , which offers sound nutritional guidance , group support and flexible food choices . The best-selling diets are trickier . Which is healthiest ? Low-fat , high-carbohydrate ( Dr. Dean Ornish 's Lifestyle Program ) ? High-protein , low-carbohydrate ( Dr. Atkins ' diet and the Sugar Busters ! approach ) ? An optimal protein-carbohydrate blend ( the Zone ) ? The scientific debate rages on : high-carb diets encourage in-sulin resistance ( meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-protein diets increase the risk of heart disease and kidney damage ; ultralow-fat diets lead to terminal deprivation and may even backfire , since fat helps regulate appetite . The argument about high-protein , low-carb diets is especially complex ; the research cuts both ways on whether they cause cardiovascular harm . And the latest news-from a Yale-Stanford review of more than 100 studies-is that there 's no link between cutting carbs and losing weight . " The greatest predictors of weight loss appear to be caloric intake and diet duration , " says researcher Dawn Bravata of the Yale School of Medicine . " If you want to lose weight , you should eat fewer calories and do so over a long time period . " You can achieve this with any of the programs above-as long as it features the foods you love . If you crave meats and vegetables , you might do well with Atkins . If you delight in pasta and rice , the Zone could be your best bet . For a nice balance , there 's the Mayo Clinic Healthy Weight Pyramid : unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( minimum , three ) ; four to eight servings of carbohydrates ( whole-grain breads , pasta , rice ) ; three to seven servings of protein/dairy products ( low-fat milk and cheeses , meats , seafood , legumes ) ; three to five servings of fats ( oils , avocado , nuts ) ; up to seventy-five calories of sweets . No matter how you lose weight , your chances of keeping it off are best if you eventually adapt your diet to include lots of high-quality carbohydrates : a recently released USDA study found that people whose diets are more than 55 percent carbs ( fruits , vegetables , whole grains ) enjoy the lowest BMI ratings and consume 200 to 300 fewer calories per day than their peers . Expert Assistance You have a better crack at making long-term dietary changes , say the American Dietetic As-sociation and several other groups , if you consult an expert-whether it be a nutritionist , dietician or doctor . A case in point : Angelina Painter , a managing director of U.S.Trust , was looking to lose about twenty-five pounds when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nutrition and weight reduction . After giving Painter a complete medical workup , Klauer designed a program that reflected her back-to-basics approach : plentiful fruits and vegetables , low-fat protein and dairy products , vitamins and calcium supplements , forty minutes of exercise daily and regular visits for nutrition and lifestyle counseling . A quick initial weight loss helped , but what really made the difference was Dr. Klauer 's personal involvement . " We 'd talk through things , " says Painter . " When I 'd go on a trip , we 'd discuss situations I might face . For me , the challenge was going to dinner parties and not having that glass of wine . Or she 'd draw a dinner plate and tell me how much of it should be protein , how much vegetables . She 'd say , ' Eat your vegetables first , so your protein will seem bigger . ' We took power walks in the park and did exercises along the way . " Under Klauer 's customized coaching , Painter lost twenty-five pounds ( still off a year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership of her lifestyle . " It puts you in control , " she says . " Now if I go to a dinner party and I want to eat my whole dessert , it 's my decision . I exercise every day ; it 's a choice I 've made . I could n't do anything about growing older , but I did n't want to grow older and fatter . " The portrait of eating disorders is a study in shadow and light ; the grim statistics on anorexia ( self-starvation ) and bulimia ( the binge-purge syndrome ) are brightened by glimmers of hope for better , more effective treatments . First , the bad news . Eating disorders are on the rise : their incidence has at least doubled since the 1960s . And though the typical anorexic is still a woman under twenty , many millions of sufferers today are girls under ten , men and , reportedly , middle-aged women . In addition , eating disorders are notoriously difficult to treat : many of the 5 million to 8 million Americans ( 85 to 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of those who do , only about half recover fully . Between 5 and 20 percent of sufferers eventually die of medical complications , including arrhythmia , metabolic and gastrointestinal problems and emotional distress leading to suicide . Nevertheless , experts express cautious optimism . Steps in the Right Direction " People come into treatment earlier than they once did , and clinicians are much better informed . That 's a big advance , " says psychiatrist David Herzog , president and founder of the Harvard Eating Disorders Center ( hedc.org ) . " The earlier a woman seeks help , the more likely she is to recover . " And since research has revealed eating disorders ' genetic component , a study is under way to isolate the relevant genes so as to help devise new treatments . Nonetheless , eating disorders are daunting-tricky to spot , wrenching to acknowledge . Victims ' self-critical perfectionism makes them ashamed of their behaviors , often deftly concealed beneath a veneer of normalcy . One recovering anorexic recalls how she masked her self-imposed stringent food restrictions behind her former husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake , it was okay for me to be precise and finicky , " she says . " We always ate in a below-normal range . " A newly recognized compulsive behavior that is also concealed is exercise bulimia . Instead of purging by vomiting or using laxatives , exercise bulimics work out for a carefully calculated number of hours every day to burn a specific number of calories . They 'll often go to great lengths to hide their compulsion-for example , setting the alarm for the middle of the night to go running . This disorder is further overlooked because we think of exercising as an absolute good , and we view people who do it regularly as enviably disciplined and dedicated . It 's not easy for medical professionals to distinguish between a person simply passionate about a sport or other pursuit and the obsessive who 's driven by body-image problems and other emotional issues . All of this underscores how important it is to seek help for an eating disorder as soon as possible . Once a woman does so , she is assessed for risk factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating disorders , obesity , depression , substance or sexual abuse ; a history of dieting or doing gymnastics or ballet , activities in which body shape counts ) , and a treatment is selected . For women who binge and purge many times daily or who are extremely underweight or suicidal , a hospitalization of several weeks or months is necessary . Inpatient and outpatient treatments alike feature a broad arsenal of psychotherapies ( group , family , couples or individual , often for several sessions a day ) , supervised meals and antidepressant medications . The Body-Image Problem A large part of the treatment involves helping the patient reshape her crushingly negative body image . " A woman 's loathing of her body can keep her from getting a job , socializing or shopping for clothes ; it can damage her parenting , " says Herzog . " In her intimate relationships , she 's preoccupied and does n't want to be touched or be seen in nightwear . " Therapy can literally mean taking another look in the mirror , with the therapist alongside . " If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , ' and she 's emaciated , you gently challenge her perceptions , " Herzog says . The process becomes especially thorny when a waif-thin woman begins to put on weight . " We discuss the fact that it will be difficult for her to tolerate body change , " says Herzog . " I spoke to someone who 's gone from a size 0 to a size 2 . For her , that 's a big deal . " HOW to Help a Loved One Trying to help a friend , partner or family member with an eating disorder can be tricky . Take action by initiating a conversation and listening actively-but tread carefully . " The topic should be approached in the most supportive , empathic manner possible , because these individuals are exquisitely sensitive to criticism , " Herzog says . " You need to say , ' I 'm really concerned , and I 'd like to help . ' It may take a village-first one person brings it up , then a close friend-before it finally hits home . " For triathlete Beth Backer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept saying , ' I 'm fat , I 'm fat , ' and he finally said , ' You clearly have an issue . ' I admitted I was fixated on my weight and started seeing a nutrition counselor . I realized it was time to wake up and smell the coffee . " She reluctantly quit her intensive training ( miles of running , biking and swimming ) because she and her husband wanted to have children , but her body fat was so low that her periods had ceased . The Backers now have an eleven-month-old son , and Beth says she ca n't follow her passion for triathlons for now . " I ca n't compete and be a woman having children . " Would someone with a more severe disorder require more than a gentle expression of concern ? " Intervention is usually not necessary and not advisable , " says Michael Strober , head of the eating disorders program at UCLA 's Neuropsychiatrie Institute . " The psychological issues have a unique complexity , and an intervention could alienate the individual . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferer seems medically unstable , and in this case you 'd get her to a doctor or an emergency room immediately . Once treatment has started , family members and friends should heed the following guidelines : after educating yourself about eating disorders , scrutinize your attitudes ; if you admire or envy the person 's " willpower " and pencil-thin figure , you may undermine her efforts to change . Do n't comment on weight or appearance , nag her about eating ( or not ) or spy on her ; these actions will increase her self-consciousness and secrecy . Do n't agree to " help " a bulimic by hiding food to keep her from binging ; she will eventually resent it and binge anyway . In other words , stay clear of her struggle with food while she deals with the underlying psychological issues , but do offer her ample nourishment in the form of uncritical support and encouragement . Sidebar HOW THE FRENCH DO IT It has long been a given that the French have an edge over us when it comes to heart health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foie gras and triple-creme cheeses . The idea was reinforced a dozen years ago when researchers coined the phrase " the French Paradox " and posited that relatively high rates of wine consumption might be protecting the French heart . Studies since then have found a correlation between drinking moderate amounts of red wine and reduced heart-disease risk . Only 12 to 15 percent of Gallic adults are clinically obese compared with our 20 percent , but adult obesity rates in France are on the rise , and childhood obesity there has more than doubled since the 1980s ( the culprits : an increasingly sedentary lifestyle , plus changes in the quality and quantity of food consumed ) . Some experts say that the French will fend off epidemic obesity as long as they stick to their traditional mode of dining : three meals daily ( no snacks ) , comprising a variety of fresh , high-quality foods in modest portions , savored slowly ( no seconds , no skipping the haricots to get to the tarte Tatin ) and eaten mostly in a family setting . Wait a minute-is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat ? D.G. COMBATING TOXIC WEIGHT " A woman can keep her body fat down and her muscle mass up into her late thirties . Then something curious happens , " says Dr. Pamela Peeke , author of Fight Fat After Forty ( Penguin ) and an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine . Partly because of waning estrogen , says Peeke , many forty-something women add a " menopot " - an extra layer of fat on the abdomen . This wo n't seriously jeopardize their health , and sticking to a sensible lifestyle can reduce it . But what Peeke calls " toxic weight " - excess fat under the abdominal muscle wall due to chronic stress , overeating and inactivity-is another story . Toxic weight , Peeke asserts , compromises the immune system and interferes with the liver 's ability to break down cholesterol , raising your risk of heart disease . " The way to minimize toxic weight is to be stress-resilient-eating well , exercising and using your mind appropriately to lower your stress levels . " She recommends the following : eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , fat-free yogurt , low-fat string cheese ) three hours later ; for lunch have a high-quality protein ( such as cottage cheese or lean turkey ) , a fat ( like olive oil ) and carbohydrates ( whole grains , brown rice , fruit or vegetables ) ; eat a midafternoon snack , such as natural peanut butter on a whole-grain cracker ( " excellent fat , protein and high-quality carbohydrate " ) ; for dinner consume soup or salad , vegetables , and lean poultry , meat or legumes . Avoid refined starches ( white rice , white flour ) , which stimulate appetite and make women retain water ; highly processed fat-free foods ; and large portions ( " News flash : you are not a man ; the rule for women is to taste and savor a few bites of each food-no gulping or overconsuming " ) . Peeke also recommends thirty to forty-five minutes daily of high-intensity exercise-running , weight training , brisk walking-along with mindbody soothers such as meditation and yoga . D.G.

How to choose the weight-loss program that 's best for you-and no one else but you . BY DIANE GUERNSEY Sidebar What 's Your BMI ? The Body Mass Index ( BMI ) is a measure of body fat . To calculate your BMI : multiply your weight in pounds by 703 . Multiply your height in inches by your height in inches . Divide the first result by the second . Example : If you 're 5 foot 5 and weigh 125 pounds , your BMI is 20.8 . A BMI of 18.5 or less means you 're underweight ; 18.5 to 24.9 , healthy ; 25 to 29.9 , overweight ; 30 and above , obese .
