TOTAL-BODY WORKBOOK v2.0 ARMS ( 2 ) Chapter 8 of our 10-part series <p> VIDEO GAMES ARE N'T USUALLY ASSOCIATED with fitness . But you could probably learn something about building muscle from that old Atari 2600 in your basement . Like most video-game systems , it lets you start with easier versions of a game when you 're a beginner and adds tougher levels of play later on . The reason : You need to keep challenging yourself in order to improve . <p> The same holds true for your muscles . They adapt to your exercise routine by growing , which in turn makes your workout easier . But the longer you do the same exercises the same way , the less the muscles are forced to progress . And that means you get diminishing returns on your workout investment . <p> In this chapter of Total-Body Workbook v2.0 , designed by Men 's Health exercise advisor Michael Mejia , C.S.C.S. , we 're going to make all of the standard arm exercises men normally use more difficult . Think of it as playing a video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . You 'll have to rise to the occasion . Follow this plan and your muscles will do the same . THE MUSCLE GROUPS BICEPS TRICEPS BRACHIALIS BRACHIORADIALIS <p> Version 2.0 of the Total-Body Workbook is a sequel to a workout series that ran 2 years ago in Men 's Health . Our goal this time is to show you how to build muscles that show and go . Stick with it and you 'll build the body you want in the time you have . Guaranteed . <p> MISSED PREVIOUS CHAPTERS ?
