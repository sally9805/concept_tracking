/Jan 2002 When it comes to ceramics , Susan Peterson has done it all . An Honorary Fellow of the American Craft Council recipient of the prestigious Charles Fergus Binns Medal from Alfred University for distinguished service to the ceramics field and of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts , Susan has been a potter for over half a century , as well as a teacher , administrator , writer and curator . She established ceramics programs at Chouinard Art Institute , the University of Southern California and Hunter College , and was called in to organize the Joe L. Evins Appalachian Center for Crafts . Susan 's books on Shoji Hamada , Lucy Lewis and Maria Martinez are classics ; to this list of monographs must be added her recent volume on Jun Kaneko . Pottery by American Indian Women : The Legacy of Generations is the title of narz important 1997 exhibition she curated and the accompanying catalog she wrote . Working With Clay is a valuable introductory work , while The Craft and Art of Clay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text . Susan shows no sign of slowing down . Just back from China , with the Kaneko book and another , Smashing Glazes , hot off the presses , she was about to launch into revisions for a new edition of Working With Clay when she took time out to engage in a marathon interview that touched on some ofthe high points ofher extraordinary life and career . " Confrontation with clay , " she says , in The Craft and Art of Clay , " can bring us into contact with the self-earthy , intense , passionate . " Conversation with Susan brings one into contact with the whole world of ceramics and with an earthy , intense , passionate and altogether delightful individual.1 ROBERT SILBERMAN : Shall we start with the obvious question ? How did you decide to become an artist ? SUSAN PETERSON : I do n't think there was ever a moment that I did n't believe I was going to be an artist . When I was 16 , a painting I made in my Nebraska high school won a national contest for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company 's Art Awards Program . My father , who was high school principal , wrote artists ( all male ) asking if art school was better than an academic college . All answered that they wished they 'd had a liberal arts background instead of art school . So I ended up in college instead of at Carnegie . Also , every summer of my youth my father taught at some university-Harvard , Wisconsin , Missouri , Montana , Wyoming-and my mother and I took painting classes , usually from a famous visiting artist . I was sure I 'd become a painter . When it came time to pick a college , the war was on . Some women 's colleges had good art departments , so I went to Monticello College in Illinois for the A.A. degree , then to Mills College in California for my A. B. degree , finishing in 1946. 1 got a fantastic education . Both schools influenced me , especially Mills . My mother had an etching on her wall by Roi Partridge , who was head of the art department at Mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Imogen Cunningham taught photography , Raymond Puccinelli sculpture , Dong Kingman watercolor  --  the art faculty were philosophers as well as professional artists . Darius Milhaud and Stravinsky were on the music faculty . Dave Brubeck was a graduate student-Mills allowed men in grad school . What made you turn from painting to ceramics ? I started ceramics at Mills in my last semester , with F. Carlton Ball . He had been a student of Glen Lukens at the University of Southern California , who was for a long time the only ceramics teacher in California . Ball was six feet two , a former boxer , a charismatic person . I did n't stay for grad school even though I won the scholarship for the M.F.A.-or I might have become Mrs. Carlton Ball ! I was fascinated by the wheel . I loved working in 3-D . The clay was soft , pliable , easier to change than paint . I loved the color that came out of glaze . It was different from pigment on canvas . And after Mills ? I was lured by palm trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Honolulu . Being in Hawaii for a year right after the war was one more exciting experience . When Ball wrote me that he was having a summer workshop with Clarence Merritt , an expert on glazes from Alfred University in New York , I returned to Mills to attend the workshop . The Natzlers were there , Edith and Brian Heath , Jade Snow Wong , Tony Prieto and other potters I had only heard about . We all learned what none of us on the West Coast knew : the chemistry and mathematical calculation of clays and glazes . My father by then was director of curriculum for the Wichita , Kansas , schools , and my mother belonged to the Wichita Art Association , which had a museum and a school and held the annual National Decorative Arts  --  Ceramics Exhibition . Maude Schollenberger , the director , wanted ceramics to be taught and my father arranged for me to do it . I 'd had that one semester of ceramics in college . Now I had to develop a new department  --  wheels , kilns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night until I made enough money to apply to Alfred for January 1949 . But I was not admitted , because Charles Harder , the famous Dean of Ceramic Art , said I was from the West Coast and that nobody from the West Coast knew anything about clay . Carlton Ball knew nothing about ceramics , said Harder . He also said that potters on the West Coast were making bright colors and clunky ware . He was right about that ! Carlton was firing Lincoln ( California ) Fire Clay to cone 07-much too low . Well , I had never been denied like that before . I was high school and college valedictorian . I called Clarence Merritt and he said , " I 'll take care of it . Come . " So I got on the train . I did n't know Alfred was a town of 300 people , mainly Seventh-Day Baptists . Nobody knew I was coming . I had a steamer trunk and the train stopped at Hornell . I asked , " How do I get to Alfred ? " and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got there and found the Dean of Women , who turned out to be the same dean I 'd had at Mills . She asked where I was going to stay-there were no dorms for graduate students . She took me home and put me on her couch and called the Dean of Men , saying , " You have a cupola on the top of your octagon house you 're not using ? " So I wound up there-no heating , glass all around , no weather stripping , I just about froze that winter . But the worst thing was walking into the College of Ceramics . The Dean of Women said I would have to make peace with Charles Harder . When I got to his office , Harder said , " I told you not to come , " and I replied , " Clarence Merritt said I could come . " That was the beginning of my woes . Merritt finally took me to Dean Scholes , who headed the ceramics college , and got me enrolled . But I was totally ostracized . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semester I flunked everything but glaze technology from Merritt . Ai n't academic politics grand ! A C-grade then meant no credit for the course . They arbitrarily gave me C 's so I would get no credits and have to leave . Merritt took me back to Scholes , who took my side . So I graduated with my class in 1950 . The others had been there three years ; I 'd been there a year and a half . I was a hard worker-totally involved . I had no car and there were no bars because of the religious community . We worked in the studio day and night . Daniel Rhodes returned to Alfred as a professor after the war . He and Vivika Heino had been the first two M.F.A. degrees in ceramics given there , in 1943 and 1944 . One ceramic workroom had a glass kiosk in the middle . Often Rhodes would be inside , taking one student at a time for a crit . But never me . He closed up the kiosk when my turn came . Finally , I confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the library . " He pulled out books . Then he started drawing , showing me profiles and cross sections of forms . This was the most wonderful thing that happened to me at Alfred , almost . I knew from nothing about 3-D form . He had summed me up exactly . He barely talked to me again at Alfred . Later , when he came to study painting in California with Rico Lebrun , he lived briefly with me and my family and said he did n't remember anything of our Alfred experience . But he had shown me what I needed and that you can teach anybody anything . My forms were lousy , my decoration not good . I was not born gifted . You have to go with what you 're given . When I began , I was a timid tweaker . Other memories of Alfred ? Once Harder came in after we 'd been working in our clay-encrusted studios all night . He said , " Go home , get a toothbrush , we 're taking a little trip . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design show of ceramics and metal . Then he took us to Cranbrook and had us look at the little room where Maija Grotell taught , and showed us the Carl Milles fountains and the beautiful green lawns . Finally he took us to the Ford Motor Company to see the mass-production conveyor belts run by men in white coats . When we got back to Alfred , he asked " Now what do you think ? Do you like what you do here better than what you saw ? " Of course we did n't want to do mass production , nor work in confines like Cranbrook . Harder still believed " the greatest good for the greatest number " should be our guiding principle , and at Alfred the program then was Industrial Ceramic Design . Most companies did n't want designers , but Corning hired one of our class , Blenko Glass another , and one went to Lenox China . Harder wanted us to be hand potters but understand all aspects of production . Maybe he thought we 'd all set up small shops . My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harder invited Leach for his first trip to America , to work with us graduate students for three months . I was mesmerized . A year after I graduated , I went back to Alfred with my ceramic engineer husband , Jack Peterson , whom I had married at Alfred , and we had dinner with the Harders . He said , " Susan , you wrote the best thesis I ever read . " It was titled " Design : The Common Denominator in Earthenware , Stoneware , and Porcelain , " because they made me do it all . At first he had said , " You 're a woman , you 'll just have babies . " I had gone through everything-the whole gamut of ceramic art-as they threw the book at me . But I loved his belated compliment . What did you do after graduation ? When I was trying to start out as a designer , there were 400 production potteries in the Los Angeles area . Usually the superintendent was an Alfred grad and I could get in the door . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . There were no designers . I finally landed a job at the Max Weil Pottery-they made the first square dinnerware with round corners . Weil asked if I could do slipware , mold-making , jiggering and mix glazes and fire a kiln . I could handle all the basics because we 'd done that at Alfred . So he said , " Okay , you 're the vacation replacement . You 'll have a new job every two weeks . " That was the start of my next great education . But you went back to teaching ? Yes , at Whittier Union High School . How did you wind up at Chouinard ? The Chouinard Art Institute was a famous " fine art " school , but the GI 's were coming back after the war and wanted something vocational too . So Nelbert Chouinard , the founder , put in industrial design for a year . But the equipment cost a lot , so she asked what else there was . Somebody said , " Ceramics . " I was substitute teaching in ceramics at Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made the department by hook and by crook while I was teaching high school . I also had a baby . Mrs. Chouinard said , " Susan you have to make these kilns so they can be picked up by forklifts in the middle of the night in case the creditors come . " That 's how we got updraft kilns on the West Coast ( the East Coast had downdrafts , built directly on the ground ) . My husband did n't know how to do that , but our friend Mike Kalan , another Alfred engineer , said , " Oh sure , that 's the oldest form of kiln in the world , fire underneath , flue on top . " That kind of kiln could be on legs ! We built two for Chouinard , and I had Mike build a 16-cubic-foot one for me for my own studio , which I have used over the years and brought here to Arizona . I can fire to cone 10 reduction in four to five hours . The department was built and ready by summer 1952 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacArthur Park from Chouinard , in 1954 . Voulkos , from Montana , was winning national prizes with elegant , functional forms , but with recognizable Alfred glazes . Beautiful pots . But we knew this guy had never been to Alfred . Where did he come from ? I had gotten a letter from Voulkos before he arrived , saying , " Jayne Van Alstyne says I have to talk to you before I take the job at Otis . " She taught Industrial Design at Montana State College , so that was the Alfred connection ; she knew the glazes and she knew me . Jack Peterson made the wheels for Chouinard that Voulkos saw when he came . Our two big kilns could hold a lot of stuff Voulkos had Kalan build an even larger kiln for Otis , because he knew he was going to make big stuff , and that kiln burned the building down . What was it like to set up a program ? It was different from Wichita . I 've always been sure of myself and willing to try anything . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been indoctrinated by Leach , but I had not yet met Shoji Hamada . I just think I was gung ho . I was going to teach . I was a crusader for making your own money , going your own way and yet not working for money only . In 1952 1 wrote an article , " Why Is n't Craft Art ? " I asked , " Why could n't we be in museums and galleries ? " There was a gallery in a hotel in Los Angeles with work by Glen Lukens and the Natzlers , but that was it . I never expected to see what we are seeing now . Of course , then it was 11 craftsman , " not " craftsperson . " The idea was to learn how to do everything so you could decide what you wanted to do . My students at Chouinard were fine-art trained , really well trained , so they easily picked up on every challenge I threw out . If theywere developing a functional pot , they brought their sculptural experience with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my students were men , men who had been to war . They were mature , they had commitment . Youngster that I was , I knew how lucky I was . One day , when I was just getting the studio built , this guy walked in and asked if I needed an assistant . I said I did n't think so . Then I thought again . Maybe I could use an assistant . He explained he was at Otis , but they had only a small kiln . Could he exchange being an assistant for tuition ? That was John Mason , who became my student and assistant . John was n't making big work then , he was just beginning . It was Voulkos who later started the big stuff . As far as I know , none of us had seen Picasso 's ceramics . I just think that Pete was this wild , gifted , energetic fellow who kept making multitudes of cylinders and stacking them up . We got along fine . People were always going between Otis and Chouinard . Pete was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soldner came as Pete 's first student , then Mike Frimkess , Mac McClain and Jerry Rothman . Ken Price was in high school when he came to my class at City College . In fact , Ken used to tell me that he climbed over the transom at night to work . When I moved to the University of Southern California , Ken came too and graduated from there . He was so gifted . I called Dan Rhodes at Alfred and said , " Would you like to have the most talented student I have ever seen for grad school ? " In my classes , Price was a continuous worker , a continuous thinker . He still is . You brought Leach , Hamada and Yanagi to Chouinard ? When we started , Mrs. Chouinard asked me what I 'd like to do to inaugurate the program . I replied that I 'd like to bring Bernard Leach because I wanted him to see the West Coast . Leach wrote back , " So sorry , Hamada is making his first trip to England since the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamada . " Leach wrote again , " So sorry , Dr. Soetsu Yanagi is making his first trip to England since the war , with Hamada . " Mrs. Chouinard said-you guessed it- " Okay , invite Dr. Yanagi . " I had read about Hamada and Yanagi in Leach 's book and at Alfred had heard Leach speak of them both . When they came , in 1952 , they sat on the big stage at Chouinard . We had made a hand-turned chestnut wheel for Hamada and a treadle wheel for Leach . People came from Northern California and the East , and Voulkos was there from Montana . Leach took the initiative and said , " My friend Mr. Hamada does not speak English and he will work all the time . Dr. Yanagi will give a lecture every morning and every afternoon on folk art . " My first misconception , our misconception , was that Hamada did n't speak English . I forgot he had lived with Leach in England for three years . So we did n't talk to Hamada . Yanagi put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day . I do n't think any of us understood what he was saying because we did not yet have any concept of what folk art was . I did n't take a single note . I do n't think anyone did . We did n't know what we were looking at or what we were listening to . We did n't know about Hamada , or that Yanagi had lectured at Harvard , Princeton , Yale , Stanford , Honolulu . What about the actual making ? I think we were n't really interested . Theywere performing on stage . There was no intimacy . One day they did a critique of our work and Voulkos brought a pot and Hamada refused to talk about it . Probably it was too good a pot ! Ten years later , in January 1962 , I went to Japan during my first sabbatical . I had n't been to St. Ives yet . I 'm not sure I was even thinking about those guys except in terms of my own work . But our relationship grew mightily over the years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book about Hamada . A wonderful book . But let 's stay in California . You 've described the ceramics scene in Southern California around the time you were at Chouinard as " a vortex of exploration and development . " In June 1957 at Asilomar , California , there was the first American Craftsmen 's Council national meeting , organized by Mrs. Vanderbilt Webb . Architects , designers , artists , Charles Eames , Rhodes , Voulkos-a real mix . We Californians , because we were hosting , had our own exhibition . At Alfred they used kick wheels and made small pieces . Rhodes sees the big Voulkos pots , the big Soldners , big Carlton Ball pots , and says , " Tell me , are those-the Ball pots-all thrown in one piece ? " I said , " Yes . " He said , " On what wheel ? " He had n't seen it done , so he could n't believe it . The potters in Los Angeles were working big and letting go , attacking the clay and swinging it around . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Voulkos . It came from the old sense of pioneering . Pioneering the wheel design , the glazes , the big kilns , the size of the piece . Was there a rivalry between the West Coast and East Coast ? I do n't think so . I do n't think we realized there should be a rivalry . I just think we were so much better , farther along . Besides , East and West did n't talk to each other in those days . And everything was happening so fast . Museum exhibitions , including the competitions at the Everson Museum and in Wichita , and gallery exhibits-Voulkos and Kaneko had a twoman show at the David Stuart Galleries in Los Angeles in 1968 , and there was the Fetus Gallery , Irving Blum . We were all working professionally and some of us were teaching as well . Why did you leave Chouinard for USC ? Nelbert Chouinard told me I was only an adjunct to her program in painting and sculpture . So that helped me make up my mind to go to the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majors and grads , and better equipment-six kilns for example-and could develop a complete ceramics curriculum . And that led to your long association with the Idyllwild Arts Summer Program . How did that start ? Max Krone , Dean of Music at USC , and some others , bought 250 acres on a mountain between Los Angeles and Palm Springs in 1950 . He was from the East and knew of Interlochen in Michigan and Tanglewood in Massachusetts . Originally his idea for the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts was a family program that would be educational as well as recreational for all ages . Meredith Wilson wrote The Music Man there , while he conducted the summer orchestras . Merce Cunningham and John Cage were there and all kinds of artists from all over taught . Anyone who was somebody in folk music came . Pete Seeger hitchhiked out , as did Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee . The synergy there was the reason . I was in the clay studio at USC when Max walked in the door and said , " How 'd you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smog , so I said , " Fine and dandy . " Over the years I added three buildings for ceramics . I could work there all the time , every summer . Though I had my own studio at home , it was different firing in the mountains . After being with students from nine to five , my assistants and I did our own work , fired kilns and got tons ofwork done at night . I was there 30 years , for 10-week summer sessions . In the beginning I did all the teaching . Later I had visiting artists part of the time . Rhodes came , Jerry Rothman , Marilyn Levine , Tony Hepburn , Clayton Bailey and lots of others .

The Pennsylvania Dutch chest is a family heirloom. // From 1967 or so I planned an American Indian program at Idyllwild every summer for four weeks , initially funded by the National Endowment for the Arts , then by USC . Weavers , basketmakers , jewelers and of course ceramists-Maria Martinez was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families . I was head of the art department at Idyllwild and invited Franqoise Gilot ( the painter and author ofMy Life with Picasso ) and Dr. Jonas Salk to teach . June Wayne , the lithography lady , had a party where I met Francoise , and on the spur of the moment I asked her whether she would be interested in teaching painting at Idyllwild . The next day she called and said she 'd love to , but that Jonas would like to teach too . Like a dummy , I asked , " What would he teach ? " " Creativity , " she said . I did n't know he had written two books on this subject . So they both taught and we became friends for all these years . Jonas would teach from nine to four , with breaks for lunch and tea . His class was divided into 15minute topic segments with students hanging on his every word . He taught just that once , but Franqoise returned for several more summers . We take a break from the QandA to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceramics , " Wheels , Kilns , and Clay , " 54 half hour programs .

Susan filmed these segments herself with a 16mm camera . She presents diagrams showing bow to set up a studio with a sample floor plan and discusses how to organize one 's independent business , saying , " Working as a studio potter is not an easy life because one has to work all the time . " How did you come to do this television show ? The head of film at USC recommended me to the CBS affiliate , KNXT , which covered the West . We did two practice runs for the television program .

I had a potter 's wheel , a kiln , worktables , a glaze booth , a Parisian-style window , very Montmartre . It was the hardest work I 'd ever done , but I loved it-I always wanted to be Shirley Temple ! I had a ball , but I was a nervous wreck . I was teaching a full schedule at the time . Now I 've made these shows available on video . 2 You 're so coherent , did you write everything out and use cue cards ? I did n't have time . The only cues I required were for minutes toward the end of a show . I had it all in my head . But I spent 18 hours in my own studio before each show , trying to make the best 30-minute compilation . And , like Julia Child , I had duplicates of everything under the tables-six or eight of each piece-because the klieg lights dried everything out instantly . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case I became ill . I could n't plan the whole 54-show series at the start . So I went from program to program making up ideas . We did each show straight through live . My father had a wonderful drama teacher in his high school , where I went , so he had made me take dramatics . It was those high school classes and plays that made me so comfortable with the television show . In 1972 you moved to Hunter College in New York City . What were the differences between USC and Hunter ? First of all , USC was populated entirely by blondes wearing roller skates and carrying a surfboard , while Hunter was filled with people of all colors , and the facilities-at East 68th Street in Manhattan-were lousy . It was a real urban institution . Ceramics was in the basement of the old Hunter High School building . There was no campus . But it was a fine school with fine professors . It was also an A.B . degree college , no B.F.A . What about New York ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists ? Toshiko Takaezu was at Princeton , Hui Ka Kwong at Rutgers , also New Jersey , and Alfred was way upstate . There was no ceramic scene as there was in California . I spent time at the theater and the opera , and I was busy building the department . And I brought two children with me ; my other child was in college . I needed two teachers for the program that Jacqueline Wexler , Hunter 's president , wanted me to build . My first colleague was Karen Karnes , for two years . Then John Mason came for 11 years . Neither John nor I was ever able to work in our own studio in the city . I went back and forth to Idyllwild to make pots , John went back and forth to L.A. That 's one reason he quit to return to California . I built a gas kiln in my loft , but could n't fire it for lack of gas pressure . John never could build a kiln in his space . I 'd say that those years , 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . That 's when I wrote the Hamada book , the Maria Martinez book , the Lucy Lewis book , The Craft and Art of Clay , and started Pottery by American Indian Women . Let 's talk about your last big project as a creator and an administrator of programs , the Joe L. Evins Appalachian Center for Crafts . Joe L. Evins of Tennessee was retiring as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in Congress and wanted to give his state a craft center . He got a $ 10 million allocation for three years , but no maintenance budget or endowment . He also got 250 acres of government land in Smithville , on Center Hill Lake on the Cumberland Plateau . The site had five studio buildings , administrative buildings and dorms-cottages for 80 students , brought from somewhere-but nothing else . Clay , Fiber , Glass , Metal and Wood were the subjects . That had been decided , nothing more . I was asked to pick up the pieces in 1979 and open in fall 1980 . That 's just my meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a golden opportunity to create a model . My program was going to be led by a master craftsperson and an associate craftsperson in each of the five subjects . Where else could you put together a clay part , a glass part , fiber , wood and metal in one structure , learn something from each , and concentrate in one ? It was so exciting I could hardly see straight . All I had to do was find the faculty and equip the studios . It was spring and we were to open in September . Down came five people I had selected from applicants to interview . It was an isolated place , but ideal if you wanted to do your own work as well as teach . After selecting the craft faculty , I interviewed five applicants for director . Then whammo ! The board said , " You ca n't have a director . You 're the consultant . You be the director . " But I already had a job . I stayed long enough to open in the fall and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite handicaps , the school , a division of Tennessee Technological University , is going strong . Under the system I set up , people moved from medium to medium , combining interests , with daily lectures going on by the master craftspeople . We had short certification courses , workshops and apprenticeships . I considered this a unique curriculum . The mistake I made was not understanding what I had to do politically in the state of Tennessee to make things work out better . But for me , the experience was stupendous . Let 's go back to your career as a writer . Were you surprised to find yourself an author ? I like writing . I enjoyed it in college . That artistic surge when things are really going well , it 's great . I 've experienced it many times as a ceramist . But I have been fragmented , pulled in many directions . Obviously , I chose this way.That 's why I 'm not a clay artist all the time . Your first book was on Hamada and it is a classic . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folk pottery tradition ? It took 20 years for Mashiko , Japan , to recover from Hamada after his death . Today , if you say the name Shoji Hamada , people do n't know who that is . His way of life and work are gone . Ten years ago this was n't the case . Many of the mom-and-pop ceramic shops in Mashiko are being renovated into glass-fronted modern galleries and selling all this modern crap , A little of it is good ; most of it is bastardized international style.Traditional contemporary or folk ceramics are mostly gone . The influence Hamada hoped he was leaving is not there . In his own lifetime he undid himself . He did n't learn how to perpetuate himself . He thought he had done it in his museum , but he was wrong . His legacy is alive in many of us , but not in the whole world of ceramics anymore . And my book is out of print . Hamada never tried to be a philosopher . He did n't ask to give the Emperor folk art lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal was to make good pots . Leach 's original philosophy was a communal effort in the truest sense . When he and Hamada were building Leach 's pottery in Cornwall , Leach realized the workers were n't as good as he was ; he knew there had to be a hierarchy . He told me " communal " flew out the window the first week . After some years he put his stamp on his own work and the St. Ives stamp on the workers ' ' . Hamada never signed a pot , only its box ! I 'm curious . Did Hamada pay much attention to newspapers or watch television or go to movies ? He grew up in a big city , not a rural village . Hamada kept out the modern media world of television and movies . He did not wish to be touched by those things . I did not see newspapers or magazines in his home . I did not see the outer world coming in , except visitors who came to look at and listen to him . It was a communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you were Shoji Hamada , you 'd know you should n't look at work by contemporaries . If you were Ken Price and John Mason and you were working with Peter Voulkos , you would have learned not to watch him too much either . A gifted artist knows not to drink from too many fountains . Leach was like a king people came to worship . He reveled in it . Hamada accepted visitors as part of his responsibility and was always gracious , but he would rather be working . The Hamada tradition was true folk pottery , but he added his own image and vitality . Japanese folk tradition and Hamada 's tradition continued for a long time , but it is gone now , except for maybe Tatsuzo Shimaoka 's work . It is not the same in England , where you still have artist-potters heavily influenced by Leach 's work . Are there places where folk still exists ? In India folk pottery is fantastic . There are one million potters in India . Pottery in India is this pointing to Traditional Pottery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deborah Smith and Ray Meeker , are potters at Pondicherry , Sri Arubindo Ashram , who have followed a Japanese stoneware and earthenware tradition there for 30 years in their own way . But folk art is still there in the Indian culture . Also , in Africa , Michael Cardew notwithstanding . Hamada and Cardew parted company over Cardew 's philosophy of taking British stoneware and hightemperature glazes and imposing these on traditional potters in Nigeria . In Africa , yes , it is a living tradition . India seems more diversified and , to me , the pottery is more pleasing aesthetically . There 's some traditional pottery in Spain , Italy , southern France , and I assume there are pockets in Russia and Eastern Europe . But Africa and India seem the most alive . And your latest discovery ? Morocco . I had a wonderful guide . A Belgian who grew up in the Congo and had been married to a Moroccan . I found two remarkable villages . The whole damn village were potters , making what people need . And what did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we would call folk , but it is folk . When you think of folk in Hamada and Leach terms , it 's unrefined and full of spirit . In China there are villages where they say there 's a tradition of2,000 years , hardly changed , and the work is elegant . There 's a plant in a little village I visited , and hundreds ofyears ago-pre-Sung certainly-they discovered that this plant , dried , burned and with calcined calcium carbonate added , layered two or three feet high and burned again , makes a celadon glaze . Can you imagine ? Jackson Lee-really jiansheng Li-Hamada-like , is trying to establish a museum of folk ceramics of China and the world at his compound called Sanbao near Jingdezhen . He had never seen this glaze village , but he 'd heard about it and we went there . This was my fourth trip to China . My first was in 1980 , right after the Cultural Revolution . You could n't go to any pottery villages then . They said there were no roads . We did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having been there , I find it astonishing that these villages still exist and that the dynastic development from Han to Sung to Qing is available in a single village . The stylistic dynasties are visible in villages throughout the country.They progressed from earthenware to porcelain over hundreds of years and are still working . I do n't think that exists anywhere else in the world . The village where they used the plant for glaze was a kind of headquarters for Ming-style production .

Box 28 , Woodstock , NY 12498 845-331-7900 crafts@artrider.com - www.artrider.com // One of the potters said they rode horses . They had messengers everywhere . It was an eye-opener to see how much ceramic work is there , still being done . And I am sure there is more than what I have seen . I spoke to a conference of university people and said , " You must find your history . You have lost so much in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No other country has that . " And they asked , " Where do we find our history ? " And I said , " Find an elder . Go to Shanghai , to the museum and the library that Chou En-lai saved . " When I went there in the 80s , they had excavated only a few of the large Xian terra-cotta soldiers and horses . Now there are thousands , all put back together , all marching along . Shall we shift to the Southwest ? Sandzen , the Swedish painter and printmaker living in Kansas , went to Taos every summer . He was my mother 's painting teacher . She heard about Taos from him , and we stopped there en route to California every summer . I met Maria when I was about 10 years old . In 1950 , married , driving cross-country from Alfred , I stopped with my husband where I had not been since I was a kid , and that started things again and led to my Indian program at Idyllwild and the Maria and Lucy books . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing that 's going on . Lucy 's daughters , Emma and Dolores , are being copied . Another Lewis family uses the same names . Some Indians are buying greenware and using Duncan underglaze stains . The Pueblo allows this . I tell Emma and Dolores , " Youjust have to keep on your course . Do n't be angry . Do n't be influenced . " I juried Phoenix 's Heard Museum Indian Fair and Market this year and three years ago . I definitely saw less good stuff . And I do n't care whether it 's traditionally done or not . When the market comes in , when the money comes in , very often the quality diminishes . And many young Indian potters go to art school and are college educated , so that changes things too . I would prefer that the avant-garde attitude come out of their native way of life , as it does in the work of Nora Naranjo-Morse and Roxanne Swentzell . Can I help to preserve tradition ? If it is there and they see it , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren , yet she is a good potter . Cavan , Barbara Gonzales 's son ( Maria 's great great grandson ) went to Alfred , but works without a wheel using a traditional polychrome technique . At Alfred he also learned painting and printmaking . All four of Barbara and Robert 's sons are potters . She understands that this is their livelihood . Through this they will survive . But she was raised by Maria . A final thought ? Some final questions . My life as a potter-ceramic artist , teacher , writer , collector , mother-all of it.3 When you think about destiny , what is it about life that made me meet , know and understand Bernard Leach , Shoji Hamada , Maria Martinez and Lucy Lewis ?
