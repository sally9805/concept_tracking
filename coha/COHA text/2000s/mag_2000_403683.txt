/Jan 2000 Back in the Stone Age , when I was a kid , parenting lingo was in the same stage of development as colour TV . It had been thought of , but was rare , and owned by only the enlightened few . Most broadcasts to kids took the form of , " If you want to live in this house you 'll live by our rules . " Or my dad 's personal favourite , " When I say " Jump , " you say , " How high ? ' ' " Reception was limited to one station ; parents spoke with one voice . Discipline was firm and consistent . Siblings were expected to have rivalry , and parents certainly did n't try to listen so that their children would talk . And there would have been no joy in Mudville for the poor child who said to his folks , " You 're not the boss of me . " But now kids are growing up in a climate of openness . " Today , not only are parenting styles incredibly diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Toronto 's Jasmine Erie , a 20-year veteran in the parenting education field . And , she points out , " We have encouraged kids to speak up . " One way kids are speaking up is by throwing our parenting lingo right back at us . Just ask Diane Marshall , a Mississauga , Ontario mother of two , about the scene in her house : " It 's not that I had n't repeatedly explained the dangers of running what we call the circuit . The way our house is set up the boys take great delight in running through a narrow swath in the kitchen , making a sharp Indy turn past the fireplace grate and on into the family room . Here they accelerate to Concorde-level speed travelling down the hall , bank around the staircase and skate back through the kitchen . The laps are limitless . " One typical morning , as Marshall was trying to beat the Olympic get-ready-for-work record , Scott and Sean began the circuit between bites of cereal . It was a multiple-choice parenting test . Answer A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer B : Shriek like it 's the shower scene in Psycho . Marshall chose B. " I lost it . When I was finished my tirade , Sean , my eight-year-old , said , " Mommy , I think you need a time out . ' ' " What do the experts make of this ? Stanley Shapiro , co-author of Practical Parenting , states his approval : " Sean is expressing his belief that he and his mother are equals , and therefore what is good for him is also good for her . Since parenting should be based on a democratic approach and not a manipulation , the fact that Sean is imitating his mother is wonderful . " The same can be said for five-year-old Eric Manning , also of Mississauga . His mom , Michelle , relates : " If Eric is being very demanding and impolite , I correct him by telling him that that tone of voice does n't work with me . Lo and behold , if I 'm having a bad day that involves raising my voice , Eric immediately corrects me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tone of voice " changes . " Giving choices is another trendy tactic . And , let 's face it , we often use choices to coerce our kids into doing our bidding without them realizing it . So what 's to stop them from manipulating mom and dad in the same fashion ? Does " Are we going to ride our bikes or rollerblade to the store after dinner ? "  --  when no excursion has yet been planned  --  sound at all familiar ? Or the little hand pointing to the school book-order forms with the inquiry , " Should I get this book or that book ? " Funny , you must have missed the " Mommy , will you buy me a book ? " part of the equation . Calgary dad Jay Paylor read about giving choices in all the parenting books , and thought it was a good idea . " One day I wanted Wesley , our youngest , to take a bath . He was engrossed in a TV show . I said , " Wesley , you have two choices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you get out , or you can go to bed now . ' Of course Wesley opted for the bath . A few days later , Debbie , my wife , was going over a list of chores that needed to be done around the house . She told me the eaves needed cleaning and the shower needed caulking , neither of which I felt terribly inclined to do . Wesley , who was quietly sitting at the table during our conversation , said , " Well Dad , it looks like you have two choices . ' ' " Linda Levon of Willowdale , Ontario decided to subscribe to the popular parenting method , 1-2-3 Magic . When five-year-old Blake misbehaved or did n't respond immediately to his mom 's request , she started counting . The effect was quite positive , and usually Blake would change his behaviour before Levon had reached " three . " One day at lunch Blake asked for a glass of juice . Busy  --  what mother of four is n't  --  Levon failed to immediately heed his command and leap for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he had counted to two , mom dutifully had the juice in hand . Kathy Bitove of Aurora , Ontario admits to using parenting jargon she borrowed from her mother . " If my daughter Tory requests permission to do something that I do n't approve of , she will often quote the name of another child who is allowed to participate in this activity . My pat response is , " I do n't care what Lisa can do , you 're not Lisa . ' ' " ( Does n't that conjure up fond childhood memories ? ) " In return , in an effort to get Tory to wear winter boots to school against her will , I will point out that Lisa is wearing boots . I am told , " I do n't care what Lisa does , I 'm not Lisa . ' ' " Touche . Glenn DiPasquale , chief psychologist with the York ( Ontario ) Region District School Board , views this talk-back behaviour as positive as long as it is not being done in a disrespectful way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . " He does believe , however , that parents need to act as parents , and children are not always owed an explanation for our actions . " Children have to understand that adults can do some things that children ca n't . " At our house we are striving to develop a more democratic system , although there still remain traces of the old autocratic rule . There is currently a Nintendo ban on school nights , which , I must admit , was not arrived at by consensus . The other day my son Fraser came to me . I had just finished explaining the parliamentary election process to him in terms that I thought he would understand . Fraser began , " The way I see it is that you and Dad hold two seats , and we hold four . Therefore we have decided that we can play Nintendo at any time . " Ah , democracy at its finest ! Good point , Fraser , but we have n't finished our lesson yet . There is a thing called the Party Leader and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were appointed to . <p>
