BLAKEY LOST HIS WIFE to a fast-moving cancer named Dr. Kevn Foley . The doctor shared the news with Blakey on an Octoberfestless October afternoon in Blakey 's basement pool room , where the doctor seemed completely at home expounding on his love for Blakey s wife , only pausing when lining up , and usually making , a shot . FACT : This was the first time Blakey had ever met the doctor . FACT : The doctor knew trick shots . FACT : Blakey was terrifically high . Later , in the shower , a sober Blakey thought of myriad ways to harm the doctor . He could shoot him , gouge him with some fine German cutlery , disfigure him with bleach , or : knock him unconscious and put him in a car ( stolen , of course ) , drive the car to an abandoned meat-packing district , perfume the entire car in gasoline and-spark-compact the doctors existence into just a midnight plume of crematory smoke . TV was educational . At the time of the revelation Blakey had been incapacitated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Blakey feel almost guilty for being the impediment to a fully bloomed romance between the doctor and Blakey s wife Lizzie . Great things would happen after his wife moved in with the doctor , Foley assured him . Life would be better for everyone involved . Blakey envisioned them running for a thankless political office , or starting a charity , or simply exploding with sweet intentions , like a struck pinata . When the doctor finished his spiel , Lizzie came downstairs and told Blakey the truth about those out-of-state conferences , the gym membership , and all the other excuses she 'd used to spend time with the doctor ( who was now performing trick shots in the background ) . Blakey wondered if the doctor had shown his wife a thing or two on the felt . That would explain the stain Lizzie blamed on sweaty ceiling pipes . He asked , they said yes , but not before looking at each other , thoughts bumping back and forth so loudly Blakey could almost hear them . Was it the pool table or the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other one ? And remember that one table where you got up and I and you and then we ... ? The hot water gave out . Blakey dressed and within five minutes was speeding , stop sign to stop sign , to the doctors house in the Heights . He replayed more of the doctors visit in his head . The doctor s hightops coated in chalk dust . Him standing there , grinding a cube onto Blakey s favorite cue stick . Was that some kind of Freudian thing ? He could n't help but see Dr. Foleys kind stare as the front to a med-schooled mind diagnosing the deficiencies in Blakey that had driven his wife from him . He probably looked at cancer patients that way . The stricken , terminals . Blakey felt asymptomatic . How had he failed his wife ? Was he a bad conversationalist ? Did he not work , keep the cars clean , do the yard work ( until he caved and used the three Ecuadorian brothers who did the neighbor 's lawn-great , great , great decision ! ) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by going on that Cajun diet where the sheer amount of cayenne pepper made it too painful to overeat . Was he a bad catch when it came to other appetites and affections ? But how would his wife know ? It had been many weeks , fortnights , since they 'd even slept with each other , forget sex for the moment . He had timed them once and discovered they only spent fifty minutes in the same room together-for a week . Nights were even more separate . She slept in the other bedroom because she could n't take his snoring . But Blakey had tape-recorded himself , and other than the necessary farts , coughs , and side-to-side shifting and realignments , he had n't heard even a cursory snort from himself . Meanwhile , he could hear his wife inside her bedroom , turning the crisp pages of magazines and watching movies and always typing on her laptop . Now , though , knowing about the doctor , Blakey realized the spastic plastic clicks were less than innocent . They were not " work taken home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That feels so good , doctor . I love it when I pretend to touch myself where you tell me to touch myself so I can pretend to arouse myself , so that I arouse you . My husband could walk in at any minute . Counterclockwise , Doctor ? DRLOVE : MMM . LizzieBoredom : You should have taken typing . Here 's to you , Mr. Shaninatitsch , middle-school typing teacher , toupee king , and lech . Oh yes . Almost there , Doctor ( but thinking of Mr. Shaninatitsch , the hunting , the pecking . The touch typing ) . DRLOVE : NNN DRLOVE : I NEAN MMM DRLOVE : MEAN . I MEAN . SHIT . BATTERY LOW . Or , perhaps more likely : DRLOVE : Just leave him , Liz . He 's not making you happy . I am a doctor . I have money . I am good-looking and work out . My cholesterol is 170 . I will make you happy . I have motherless children and you are not yet a mother and no longer 30 . LizzieBoredom : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't love him . He does n't love me . Anymore . We 're like strangers in the same house . DRLOVE : It would be needlessly cruel to let your lives continue this way . LizzieBoredom : It 's a given . This marriage is over . But you better watch it . Blakey 's in the know . And he 's heading to your house now , clearheaded and angry . Blakey : I am . Left turn , another left , right , left , right , right-there . So close , so startlingly close ! Only 3.4 miles ! The doctor 's neighborhood was golden , pumpkin strewn , and there seemed an unusual number of children scattered about . It might be Halloween , he was n't sure . He pulled his wife 's car up to the curb ( she had taken his car earlier to go see a movie because his car was blocking hers in the driveway ) and stormed up the walkway , a gonna-kill-him rush pumping the pistons of his heart . A stone path wound past the three-car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor , Blakey noted ) , then past the combination lamppost/mailbox , then curved so that it was impossible not to take in the whole enormous house , the immaculate wood shingle siding , the painted shutters that seemed functional , the roof littered with sycamore leaves , the sycamore tree itself the post-sunset hues of oatmeal and cream and full of cawing crows-a murder of crows , Blakey noted . The entrance had been swept clean of the leaves by a broom and a pair of gloves now duncing in a corner . As soon as he heard the musical doorbell , Blakey regretted not having strode right across the lawn to the door and once there , issued a violent knock , maybe even kicked it . But it was too late , now . The door was opened by a remarkably dexterous golden retriever-no , wait , by kids just behind the door , TV-cute kids . One was a bumble bee , another a pirate . And behind them , entering what could only be called a foyer , Dr. Foley himself appeared and removed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are you supposed to be ? " asked the pirate . " Say " trick or treat , ' " said the bumble bee . The ballerina held her tongue . During the drive over , Blakey had settled on trying to break the doctors jaw . seeing the kids , plastic jack-o ' - lanterns in hand , their faces candy-starved , Blakey felt his need to inflict physical violence on the doctor reduced to something small but still bitter . He needed recompense for the loss of his wife . A rough shove , a trip of the feet . Perhaps giving the doctor a bad cold , but one that only inflicted him and did n't get passed on to his patients . But with the kids watching him and asking their father when he would take them out trick-or-treating , Blakey felt entirely impotent . " Come inside , " the doctor said , and Blakey followed . Blakey felt ill-prepared to replace brash violence with clearheaded arguments on why his wife should not take a large step up and enter the doctor s life permanently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to defend . " You want a drink ? " Blakey nodded . And soon found himself at a bar listening to Dr. Foley s story , of the kids " late mother , of the kids themselves , especially the dyslexic one , the pirate , and how they all loved Blakey s wife and how tough those first couple years as a widower had been for the doctor . He 'd taken a whole year off from his practice . He 'd had to rebuild his client base from scratch . Did Blakey know how hard that was ? The doctor 's wife had loved the sea . The doctor told Blakey how he had borrowed a friend 's sailboat ( knows how to sail , has boat-owning friends ) on New Year 's Eve ( their anniversary , of course ) and gone to the Outer Banks to scatter her ashes . Incidentally , the bar was inside Dr. Foley 's house , just off the kitchen with its twin dishwashers , fridges , stoves , and sinks . Nearly the whole house ( for he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools of light on the Berber carpet and the wood and stone flooring that seemed too perfect to be true wood or stone , but were rather improved wood and stone and doubtless more expensive than the real thing . Blakey thought of his basement pool room , his collection of jazz and seventies rock on the bookshelves , and the modest house surrounded by yards , not gardens . The doctors golden retriever began humping Blakey 's leg again . " We do n't know why he does that , " the doctor said , aiming several squirts of water at the dog 's muzzle . " It 's embarrassing . " Blakey looked down at the dog and where the spray of water had hit his own pants . He stood to leave . " Did you wet yourself ? " asked the pirate child , pointing to Blakey 's crotch in a way that made Blakey feel eight again . " I used to wet myself , " the pirate said . " But I outgrew it . " From inside the doctor 's bathroom , Blakey could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pants as dry as possible with one of the many hand towels . He heard a dozen thank-you 's from outside , the door shutting , the doorbell again , the soft plop of candy falling onto candy . It was hard not to see the reflection of himself in th enormous mirror , stooped over , like some masturbating hunchback . He turned around . The doctor 's late wife stared at Blakey from picture frames . The children were young in the photos , even cuter . There was one photo of her and the doctor , the doctors arms wrapping around her from behind , his jaw resting on her head . And there was one of just her alone , staring out a window , not particularly happy or sad , but pensive , as though she could see the car accident that would claim her , or her replacement that would appear , later , in the form of Blakey s wife . Or maybe she was simply upset that the toilet paper roll was put on the wrong way , whatever direction of wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His own wife . The doctor said his name . Blakey waited in the bathroom as he heard Lizzie gather up the doctor 's kids and take them out the door for their sugar rounds . It took all of thirty seconds . Blakey left the house unseen . His heart forgot beats on the drive home , leaving seemingly vast spaces of dead silence in his chest . He dug out a tight knot from his pants pocket and pulled out a cube of pool chalk . He peeled back the paper and wrote LIAR across the dashboard of his wife 's car , then scrawled spirals over the word until it was illegible , until he could figure out why " liar . " Would " Thanks for wasted years " be more appropriate ? Or , " Why did we even bother ? " And why did his heart not feel broken , only ill spent . What a bad , bad limb he 'd climbed . He blubbered and swore . He 'd prefer his wife 's new love to be one of the gardeners ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone but this doctor with the fine home , the children , the tragic loss of his first wife . Could n't she just have a fling , not a replacement ? Because now he was losing his sense of self and- . Maybe if he reexamined himself , all was not lost . Maybe he had more to offer . Maybe he had n't wasted the past seven-no , nine ! - years . Maybe she would fall in love with him again . And vice versa . FACT : Blakey did n't have a chance . He was a loser . FACT : Blakey rented an apartment , survived divorce proceedings , and retained custody of the cat and parrot . FACT : Blakey could n't listen to anything but the Stones for weeks on end . " You Ca n't Always Get What You Want . " His wife-nearly ex-wife-had more surprises , this time delivered over the phone . " I 'm pregnant . " " That was quick , " Blakey said , feeling instantly hurt at how urgently she seemed to be making up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . But then , " There 's a possibility the baby could be ours , " she said . " Yours . Ours . You know what I mean . Or not . " No , he did n't know . What did this news mean , exactly ? Was it possible she 'd been sleeping with the doctor so close to their last marital coupling ( he 'd heard her watching porn on her TV and he had come in , available in her eyes , he supposed ) that she really had doubts as to the father ? And , if so , did this mean there was a remote chance her egg had been assaulted by two dueling sperm not of the same father ? No , that was too disgusting an idea , his guys and the doctor 's thrashing their way wherever it was they thrashed . " Blakey ? " And why-here was the question that did n't matter anymore-why had n't she and the doctor used protection , a condom at least ? Or one of those morning-after pills-he could write prescriptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of transmittable disease ? Blakey knew that doctors were notorious smokers , drinkers , and drug users ( his own was all three ) . He made a mental note to check himself for signs when he got off the phone . And the baby , of course-what if it was something that could be passed down to the baby ? But he did n't ask these questions because his wife was going on about paternity testing . The next morning , Blakey sat alone in a clinic reading about the DNA test in one pamphlet called Paternity 1-2-3 and about amniocentesis in another simply called Amniocentesis , a trifold that had given him a bloody paper cut . For some inexplicable reason , the clinic did not stock bandages they could simply give out . He sucked his finger and looked at the colored drawing in the Amniocentesis pamphlet . A long needle reached all the way into the amniotic fluid , the tip just millimeters , at least on paper , from the curve of the baby 's soft , vulnerable skull . Everything in the drawing-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother s body-were bright and brightly colored , though Blakey suspected that , really , it was dark inside there . Or maybe faintly red , like a darkroom . Still , darkness . And in that darkness a needle headed blindly toward a baby that might be his . That was the moment it really hit him : fatherhood . Or at least the opportunity of being a father . It was the one thing in his life that was new and untouched and full , immeasurably full , of possibility . Dare he-yes , OK-he dared think the word " pregnant " with opportunity . Blakey left the clipboard and unsigned consent forms on top of old issues ofRedbook and Field &; Stream , drove back to his apartment , and Googled " amniocentesis dangers . " Despite the doctor 's assurances later that evening , via cell phone from the mountains on his week-long vacation with the kids and Lizzie , Blakey told them both he wanted to wait until the baby was born . If this was to be his son ( the ultrasound had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to risk any harm . FACT : Blakey felt reborn . FACT : He started carrying a dumbbell around the house to build up his childholding muscles . FACT : He began seeing a chiropractor to end his back pain . He woke . Taped to the ceiling above the couch where he slept was his homemade sign from the night before : GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER ! First , though , breakfast . He groaned to the coffee maker , fed the cat , then cut up some fruit for the parrot , refilled the seed cup , and changed the newspaper . His back was killing him . Worthless chiropractor . He needed to buy a bed . An hour later , after shaving his divorce beard , trimming his nose and ear hairs , and dealing with the other minor general grooming areas ( neck hair , eyebrows , the funky mole on his chest that was basically a quarter-inch patch of regenerative monkey skin ) , he was ready to move from physical revival to examining his economic state of affairs . Once his half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could live on that for a couple years before he 'd be back at zero . In the meantime there were expenses . The first and last to secure the apartment had tapped him out . He was living on credit . He 'd lost his freelance clients from not working ( now he knew what the doctor meant about client base ) , and the only work left were the book projects , with deadlines becoming obscenely overdue . The manuscripts for Write Right Press were Quirky Careers and Peculiar Professions and A Dark and Stormy Night : 1,001 Types of Weather for Writers . He 'd already included all the jobs and forms of precipitation he could conjure up without serious research , and now , well , there was n't a chance he was going to spend hours in libraries while his ( maybe ) son 's cells were dividing and subdividing into limbs and organs and needed a father who 'd be waiting for him , whole , with all his shit together . True , it felt good to be working and to fill the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waiting . He did n't know if he could distract himself for that long . Blakey looked outside . There was no weather . In fact , it might as well have been a vacuum outside , sucking him right into emptiness . And though he was on a familial basis with that feeling , emptiness , the prospect of having a son made him desire a warm summer breeze bending fountain grass , dappled shade on park lawns , and other weatherrelated imagery that adorned the free calendar he had tacked up in the kitchen . There was an early Christmas tree in an apartment window across the street . He wondered if lumberjacks still worked the forests . He sat down and wrote a section on lumberjacks for the Quirky Careers book , renaming them " forest engineers " to make it seem he 'd conducted some bona fide research . After writing up the section on forest engineers , Blakey listened to a record he 'd picked up at a yard sale earlier that week , Become a Court Stenographer ( 1969 ) . He boosted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen stenographers on TV talking into something like a gas mask-what were those called ? Audiotranscribers sounded good , he decided ) , and continued his half-improvised account of what a fictionalized stenographer , Lizzie the stenographer , might be like . He omitted her possible ambitions and dead-of-night fears ( privacy , folks-we do n't need to know how she shakes the clammy hand of midnight ) , but he imagined details to bulk up her character . He bulleted out facts about stenographers . Lizzie earns more than her husband , the forest engineer , mostly by selling trial transcripts to the media , thanks to being placed on a particularly high-profile and endless ( **37;2565;TOOLONG endless ) **25;2604;TOOLONG trial . She is falling in love with the D.A. , and he wants her to dump the lumberjack-the lumbering , blundering , blubberer-and take dictation just for him . Blakey worked all day into evening , then went out for Chinese . It was a slow night , or perhaps every night was slow here-he was still scoping out the neighborhood restaurants . The kitchen staff sat at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped through a two-foot-high pile of green beans . Or maybe they were n't gossiping-he does n't speak the language , after all . They could be continuing a nightly dialectic involving- . No , no , they were definitely gossiping . He sipped from his bottle of Tsingtao and eavesdropped , understanding only syllables of what ? Mandarin ? Cantonese ? He wondered which dialect cornered the Chinese restaurant market , then , thinking of the overdue book project , began an entry for translator in his head . When Blakey returned to the apartment there was an " I 'm concerned " message on his machine from his editor at Write Right Press ( delete ) and one from Lizzie . They 'd received his message about waiting until the baby was born for the paternity test , but they 'd gone ahead with the amniocentesis that morning , at a local hospital where Dr. Foley ( she called him " doctor " ) knew the doctor personally . She paused and Blakey could see the needle enter her , pierce her womb and then into the amniotic fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was still feeling morning sickness and staying in the lodge , watching TV and drinking mugs of decaf . He could go to his clinic and deliver a saliva sample for his DNA . OK . Good-bye . He was furious at their betrayal , and so thankful he would n't have to wait all those months to learn whether he had a son . Just a saliva sample and he 'd know . A sample which he 'd provide on his own terms . They 'd have to wait for him now , for his news . He drank a fruit juice glass of Cognac , then smoked a joint . The heater had been on too long , too high , and the apartment felt a thousand degrees hot . Blakey opened a window , but the cold air seemed reluctant to enter and dissatisfying , like when he stood in front of an open freezer in summer . He poured himself a glass of ice water and stood in front of the refrigerator where , pinned by his realtor 's magnet , " Crystal Jolly-Selling with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dr. Foley . Who were these people , he wondered-like the neighbors across the street with the tree-who dragged Christmas into November ? He knew his having received the card must have been an office staff mistake . Mailing list cock-up . Oh dear . Bloody hell . He talked in mock-British until the parrot squawked at him . In the photo , Blakey 's wife posed with Dr. Foley and the doctor 's four kids , including one Blakey had n't met , even cuter than the others and hidden until Blakey had peeled away the mail-forwarding sticker . The kids resembled his ex-wife , more so the longer he stared . In fact , the soon-to-be Mrs. Foley blended so seamlessly into this family that Blakey wondered if he had imagined his own marriage to her . If , standing here in the kitchen looking at the card , he 'd just experienced an epic illusion in the span often seconds in which he had believed ( " yet how real it felt ! " ) that he had met this woman , Lizzie , in a concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and then gotten married , bought a house , woken up next to each other thousands and thousands of times , at least until she moved into the separate bedroom . Really , Blakey might not be Blakey . He 's Porter Johnson , Asian language translator , come back from a business trip in Shanghai , and he 's just had something go off in his brain , some delusion that 's played out this Life of Blakey story in his head . Some delayed flight-cabin pressure pop . In reality Porter 's got two kids at the academy , a skyline view from the penthouse window , a wife in the bedroom waiting for him ( the sex is always sublime , the lingerie outrageous , when he returns from extended business trips ) , and there , digesting in his belly , a big fat bite of American Dream . FACT : Blakey is not Porter Johnson . FACT : Blakey is both drunk and high . FACT : Blakey is about to do something he will regret . Having steadily lost its adhesion through the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign dropped silently from the ceiling , curved past the couch , and landed on the many unpacked moving boxes . Blakey remembered when tape used to be good , when it actually held things together for longer than a few hours . What had happened ? He felt lonely , thought of his son , and admitted to himself that chances were slim it would be his . After all , was n't copious copulation the mainstay of any affair ? His sperm had a hundred-to-one-shot . With all the doctors medical training , his sperm probably knew the route , what to look for , and how to get inside once there . Blakey felt angry again , here in this four-hundred-square-foot apartment , no house of his own , unemployed ( the pay for the book projects was n't worth claiming for the 1RS ) , soon nothing but the bitters and aperitifs left from what had been a well-stocked matrimonial liquor cabinet . He looked at the Foley Christmas card in his hand . There was no personal message ; just the photo , and underneath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp spears of holly . Blakey grabbed a beer from the fridge and threw the Foley family Christmas card in the trash after the bottle cap . He then searched the moving boxes for The Collected Works of William Shakespeare and flapped the book 's pages until the Polaroids came out . He and Lizzie in Vegas , hotel bed , poker chips almost concealing her nipples . The other photos-well no need to go there now when , focus , focus , focus . OK , but just this once , Blakey thought , also aware how low this was as he sat down , leaned a photo against the beer bottle , and unzipped his pants ( how he wished they had made a video ) . But nothing . Not a stirring , not a damn thing . Not even from the one where Lizzie is- . Nope . Not even with a little help . Blakey Jr . did n't have a thing for Lizzie anymore either . In the kitchen he blistered the Polaroids over the range . He could ruin her for the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sleepy female voice . Undeterred , he called the doctor s home number , got the machine , and proceeded to tell the doctor about how he and the former Mrs. Blakey had consummated their marriage in the limo ride between church and reception . He told Kevn Foley , M.D.-that 's right , K-e-v-n , some fancy spelling-a thing or two , intimate details , then exaggerations , complete fabrications , mean lies . While in the midst of recounting a fictitious three-way with a stranger , the machine cut him off . He suddenly felt cold , the apartment freezing and thick with the smell of melted plastic . He winced . What had he been saying about the woman who could , possibly , be bearing his child ? What had he spoken to the man who might help raise that child ? Was he , Blakey , to be an ugly cowbird , putting his child in a fatter , more comfortable nest , all the while crying about not getting a personal relationship with his son ? Advantageous and devastated ? And there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby filled him with remorse so strong he vomited into the kitchen sink . Why was it so hard to get your shit together ? As he ran the garbage disposal , he knew one thing : He needed to erase the doctor s answering machine . Blakey walked 3.4 miles . While sounding short , it turned into a substantial distance in his condition . He made it up the path , dusted now with first snow . The dog did n't bark , so he knew they must have taken it with them to the mountains . He lifted pots , felt under the fancy WELCOME mat , then walked around back . The yard had a wood and metal playground and a giant trampoline that looked , with the pristine layer of light snow , like a giant sugar-dusted chocolate cake . He found a key under a ceramic frog and thanked him , patting his head gently . He kept the lights off once inside . He was thirsty and poured himself a glass of water in the kitchen . He then washed and dried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd be foolish to leave the glass in the sink , saliva primed for DNA snatching . He felt his way upstairs and found the kids " rooms and the doctors bedroom . Blakey 's ex-wife 's clothes filled a quarter of a walk-in closet . He could smell her shampoo in the pillow and saw that she kept the same side of the bed as she had with him . An old photo of her sat on the doctor s side of the bed , like she had been there since their high-school romance years , ready to greet the doctor every morning with a smile . The room began to spin , so Blakey lay down on the bed , then eased into a short nap because he had forgotten how comfortable a good mattress could be , having slept on the sofa for so long now . He waited for dreams , but none came . He was empty . When he woke , he looked for a nursery , but found none . Would some of the doctor 's kids bunk together , or would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , would he , Blakey , get full custody ? If the boy was his , then there 'd be shared responsibilities , even down to naming him . Would he come here to help out in those first weeks , or would she live in his apartment ? No , no , all unlikely . Would the boy grow up here in this house , with the doctor and the doctor 's kids and a house that , he noticed now , could be dangerous for a toddler ? Who needs this many electrical outlets ? he thought to himself , counting sockets as he moved down the hallway back to the sweeping staircase-with enough space between the banister posts for a child to slip through and fall to the hard marble floor below ( " I had my back to him for just a second . Just a second ! " ) . Blakey finally found the answering machine in a nook off the kitchen , its red light blinking like a beacon . He tried to delete the message but there was only one button on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did n't hear any ringing anywhere in the house . Outside , Blakey was surprised by the amount of give in the trampoline . He swept clear a body 's worth of snow and lay on his back , the answering machine on his stomach . It was too cold to sleep . He stood and bobbed up , down , up , down , then jumped , heaving himself upward into the cold night air , and with each bounce he could see a little more over the hedge to the neighbors . A lit window . A man alone at a sink . Then turned away . Then gone . Lights out . He was flying into darkness . It seemed to take hours to come home . He could n't remember the last time he 'd seen a predawn glow . It was a little scary , the sky looking poised to catch fire . He threw the answering machine into a Dumpster . Back in his apartment , wide awake from the cold and the walk , he did n't even want to consider sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reminded himself . He made a new sign , BUY A BED ! and taped it to the mirror in the bathroom . He washed his face and felt better . He had said terrible things , thought terrible thoughts , but had taken them back now . He was getting his shit together . And then he did what he had n't done for so long . Blakey called Mexico City . He grilled his brother , a chemist there , for the ins-and-outs of his profession , taking notes as his brother spoke . Then he chatted with his sister-in-law , once a minor soap-opera star in Mexico . He 's never been to Mexico or seen their house , but in his mind he always pictured a sprawling hacienda with tile floors , the big two-foot-wide variety , and his sister-in-law walking around in bare , manicured feet and wearing a robe , or eating melon balls in the kitchen while reading foreign newspapers , or sitting in bed and reading fan mail aloud to his brother . Her story was surprisingly dull . All the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to his brother again . His brother asked him about Lizzie , and he told him the truth-she was happy , doing well . He told his brother about his book projects and asked him for weather ideas . He wrote down " ball lightning . " He wrote down " fish falling from sky " and remembered how much he liked talking to his brother . It was strange , being in the same time zone , yet with so much longitudinal distance . He wondered if his brother was going gray , too . His brother said he had to leave to go to work , and Blakey promised to call again soon . He rolled and lit up and shuffled through the stack of LPs he 'd picked up from the yard sale , settling on a Burl Ives album . Mr. Ives sang " The Owl and the Pussycat " while Blakey began working on the last half-inch of tequila from the bottle . How could we still call cats pussycats , in this day and age ? he wondered . " O lovely Pussy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What a wonderful Pussy you are , you are . What a wonderful Pussy you are . " Fifty bucks says Burl was thinking what I 'm thinking , Blakey wagered to the parrot . And then , not even to the B-side yet , an idea descended on Blakey that seemed so brilliant he said " brilliant " out loud . It was an epiphany . He immediately rounded up his ex-wife 's eighteen-pound Calico cat ( all of Dr. Foley 's kids were allergic to cats ) and the parrot , Gim me ( who only said gim me , gim me , gim me ) , and sat/perched them side by side on the kitchen counter as- " get this , " he informed them , " get this ! " - bride and groom . He was going to make something right in this world and form a new union for one that was lost . Gim me was n't an owl , but he 'd do . Blakey officiated , rendering an eloquent little speech about the blessings of lifelong companionship , all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly hungry feline bride . Gim me was half-asleep . A reception followed immediately afterward in the living room , complete with tequila for all , metal cup for the parrot , saucer for the cat . He cut up little slices of cheese and put them on crackers . He pulled down the shades to keep the rising sun at bay , then put some mellow , night-invoking Miles on the stereo . Watching the bride and groom feast , Blakey felt an immense sense of satisfaction . It was like a buzz while sober . He fell into his first good sleep in a month . The hangover was debilitating . While dumping the contents of the freezer into a garbage bag ( the door had been left open all night and morning ) , he noticed blood on the floor . And then the feathers . And then , in another room , the parrot . Dead . Later , because at the moment it hurt too much to walk , he found the oneeyed cat , or rather the cat who was now one-eyed , perhaps Gimme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at the veterinarian and then , back at the apartment , told himself that now , now , with casualties on his conscience , with a freezer full of pizzas gone to waste , he needed-no , must-get his shit together . First , he unplugged the stereo , then set up his laptop and deleted all his unread e-mail . He sneezed and the air was atomized with the scent of tequila . He got up to dump the last of the vodka into his orange juice , but held the bottle upside down over the sink instead . After all , this is what fathers do , is n't it ? he thought . Shed bad habits , get serious , face up to reality , do the right thing . The weed disappeared down the toilet so , so slowly . Blakey found the factory-direct mattress store easily . It was all glass and aluminum , like it 'd been a car dealership in another life . The late afternoon light came in sideways , all glare , and his shadow stretched over the rows of mattresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squint from all the sunlight . He was the only customer . The saleswoman approached , and rather than say he was just looking , then buy a mattress anyway , he put himself completely in her hands . She asked about the sleeping situation . Wife , partner , alone ? She explained how there were mattresses designed for each situation . He accepted the complimentary soda and listened to her and looked at their demonstration mattress with the corner cut-away that let him peer inside ( mostly coils in empty space ) . He lay down alone on a twin , then tried a queen-size , then she lay beside him so he could feel the difference . The sunlight fell behind another building at the far end of the parking lot , and the flickering fluorescents above were suddenly noticeable and unbelievably harsh . He closed his eyes . He told her about the couch he was sleeping on , then just a tracery of info about his failed marriage to explain why he was sleeping on a couch . And , yes , the mattress was comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't admit it or he 'd sound desperate ) . He told her about the books he was writing so he would sound gainfully employed , and she told him a little about herself . For his book , she said . Blakey discovered she was not just a mattress salesperson for the months of October , November , and December . She told him how she used to be a dancing instructor . This was after the semester in a dental school academy but before a weekend in truck-driving school , three years in the army , one year at a defense contractor , six years in a back office , two years at a day care center , and three years in a shoe store . Blakey figured that put her at about thirty-five or so . Lying next to her on the mattress he could only see her sideways , but she was good-looking sideways , a nice profile , really white teeth , and bright eyes . Thirtyfive seemed about right . Staring up at the grill of the ceiling speaker from which " Sailing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Christopher Cross . Blakey 's hand covered hers for the rest of the song . A minute like this , maybe , not saying much . The longest he 'd been with another woman , in private , for years . It was perfect , until the first commercial . He felt it , just lying there on the mattress : This was the one . The mattress arrived the next day . He did n't have a frame , but they threw one in . He called the mattress store to thank the saleswoman for her help and they talked for an hour , through three periods of holds , including one that was twenty minutes long and involved a sale . He wrote a new entry for the occupation book while he waited . FACTS ABOUT SALMON COUNTERS Number : Hydroelectricdam operators employ at least a dozen people to count salmon run populations , chiefly in the Northwest . The Daily Grind : Salmon returning to spawn navigate around dams by climbing water-filled chutes known as fish ladders . A salmon counter sits behind a window mounted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe the fish as they continue upstream . Trends &; Growth : Future career growth is expected to decline as dam operators increasingly adopt technology to automate fish counting . Compensation : Depends on employer but ranges from $10,000-$15,000 a year . Will be expected to assume other duties during nonspawning season . Titles : Also known as Salmon Population Engineer , or , in one case , Jeanette . Sweet , sweet Jeanette with the hip-length red hair with faint gray highlights . No longer counting fish but currently salesperson of the month in factory-direct sales at Sweet Dreams Mattress Co . Jeanette was already at the coffee bar that Friday night . They sipped doubles because it was cold out now . He said it was a cold snap , like the weather man had said , then he said that that 's what the weather man had said , in case Jeanette had watched the same forecast and thought Blakey was unoriginal . There was n't enough breathing room inside to feel comfortable , and it being too early to invite her to his apartment around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapping the battery . He looked at the fingers he 'd felt but never seen closely . She wore wool gloves with the finger parts cut off . Small , delicate fingers . Nail polish , but it was too dark in the car to tell the color . The tip of her left index finger was bandaged . He imagined her cutting a bell pepper , shiny-side up , the knife slipping ( " damn , happens to us all " ) . Because the drinks would n't fit in the car 's cup holders , Blakey held her coffee as they drove . Jeanette sucked on a stick of rock candy from the coffee bar . They moved , slippery at first , a few fishtails , then straight , past the dark laundromat , then the park and trees so beautiful it came as a shock to see them . Jeanette pulled over before he even thought to ask her to . Later , for the weather book , he wrote : HOAR FROST Hoar frost can occur in all areas where temperatures drop below - 25 R Typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost requires a combination of sustained freezing temperatures , high humidity , and little wind . Hoar frost has been observed from pole to pole , with crystals reaching as much as an inch in length . Blakey was pretty iffy about everything he was writing now , but the important thing was to make the third , or was it fourth ? , deadline . Fact checking and revisions could follow . Examples of possible usage : Covered with hoarfrost , the tree was as delicate as lingerie . Or , Lit by the park lights , the trees seemed dipped in sugar . ( First kiss , there , in the car . First first kiss in a decade . Jeanette tasted sweet and natural , but still somewhat bad for you , like all sugar . ) In his apartment Jeanette spilled cold coffee on Blakey while attempting to show him her tattoo . He only saw it after he cleaned up the spill , and this time she was less discreet in displaying a salmon tattooed on her upper left ass cheek . There was more detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They cleared the table to the wall so Jeanette could show Blakey some dance steps he did not want to attempt . And though he thought he hated dancing , he found that this was n't so . She taught him a tease of cha-cha-cha , both coasts of swing , the foxtrot . He turned off the heater but not until they were both drenched with sweat . If this were a movie , he thought to himself , this would be the moment they 'd take each other . But not only was Blakey exhausted , he could smell himself and it was the odor of a mailman on a summer day : sweet , pulpy , and ink-sour . She asked if she could take a shower , and after she finished , he took one himself , noticing the light rings of her hair in his tub . Despite being hot , the water felt wonderful . He thought again of how , in a movie , they 'd have taken a shower together , even on a first date like this one , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts of kisses and caresses , hands running down sides , a quick but tasteful butt shot or two . Blakey extended his shower by another ten minutes to allow his erection to go down . He dried , dressed , and hoped Jeanette had n't become bored , or fallen asleep , or left . He had a fleeting image of Dr. Foley standing in his apartment , holding hands with Jeanette , and her smiling up at him . But he found Jeanette sitting alone on his new mattress , towels around her hair and body . She 'd turned out all the lights , and the only illumination came through the windows . Light snow falling , caught in the streetlights . " It 's beautiful , " she said . And she said it so honestly that Blakey was afraid she had forgotten she was only wearing towels and that he should look away in case she noticed . Except she turned her head to him just then , and smiled . The sex-the sex was cool , slow , comfortable . It was n't like dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work . Like he had known her for much , much longer than just a week . Blakey woke an hour or so later with a dull headache . He brought back a bottle of aspirin from the bathroom , and they each popped a couple and downed them with a shared glass of water , then looked outside at the snow falling , just small specks of snow . And then , this time , the sex was just like dancing . And then , even later , it was shower steam and hands on tile , the water dripping off Jeanette 's nipples as though she were lactating . But it was n't comfortable and he could n't finish anyway-and instead they stood together in the shower , laughing and making funny hairdos out of shampoo and Jeanette 's long , long hair . She was punk rocker , then alien , unicorn , Princess Leia , Big Foot , beautiful . The phone rang during the night and he heard his ex-wife 's voice on his machine . " Just calling to say Dr. Foley took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , " she said . " So nothing for you to worry about . " Jeanette turned in her sleep and moved away from him . Blakey sat up in bed and waited for the sadness to come . But it did n't come . It stayed far outside , tiny shreds of sadness like the falling snow . He settled back into bed and spooned Jeanette . In the morning , after Jeanette left for work , Blakey lay on the bed and played with one of her long stray hairs , the only one he could find in the bed . He liked her , really liked her . She was like a vacation from his life . Could he stay in Jeanetteland longer ? What was the immigration policy ? He stepped out of bed to reach the phone and call her at work when his big toe squashed something soft , yet hard , too . Like a raisin . If it were spring , he 'd easily mistake it for some exotic tree seed , some sidewalk fruit that got embedded in his sole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them now , and this was no fruit . He looked closer . It was the cat 's eye . For the rest of the morning Blakey felt terrible about the cat . He hoped some amicable peace could develop between himself and his ex-wife 's cat , some forgiveness on both sides for the things that had made the relationship with the parrot come apart , whether rooted in betrayal , alcohol , or the more primeval animosity that had doomed the arranged marriage . He realized he felt more remorse for this failure than for the breakup of his own marriage . After all , no one had died during his divorce . There had been no physical violence ( and none inflicted on Dr. Foley , unfortunately ) , no trips to the ER . He drove to the veterinarians and picked up the survivor of the marriage . The feline widow was ghastly looking thanks to twenty-three stitches and the bruising . She was shaved in places that he did n't think would have needed shaving . There was something embedded where her eye once took root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of her a bit , afraid he could n't rely on his former expectations of cat behavior with one who 'd survived such an ordeal . In the apartment , he used a ruler to open the door to the carrier . She would n't have anything to do with him and did n't come out for an hour . Blakey did n't play any music that evening . The next evening he drove to the mattress showroom and left the car running . This much he knew : When his half off the equity money came in , he and Jeanette were going to have some fun . Go someplace warm , like Puerto Rico . Or maybe visit his brother in Mexico and talk about when they were younger and start over with those memories as his rootstock . He 'd spend , say , $10,000 , just like that , on a room with an ocean view , breakfast in bed , swimming , sleeping . He could see Jeanette smiling at him from a hotel pool . If , in all the sex they would certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pregnant , he would be ready for the feeling and even , he knew now , want her to be . And then , when he got back , he 'd find a regular job . Something steady . There were a book 's worth of career ideas in his head , though none appealed to him yet . None called out to him , saying , " Join us , Blakey . Become a . " He 'd like to own a record store that sold nothing but Hawaiian music . Maybe ukuleles , too . Buying and fixing up old houses also appealed to him , though he knew he had little grasp of repair work . Teaching also seemed plausible ; at least the concept of teaching was attractive , but only to bright kids , kids with good taste in music and no B.O. From inside the car Blakey watched Jeanette close up the yellow-bright mattress store . He lost sight of her for a few minutes , then the store lights vanished . The night was purple . " This ca n't end well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or unmentioned ex-husband ) that 'll come back into the picture ( " suddenly showed up again , can you believe it ? " ) or she 'll simply discover whatever qualities Lizzie discovered that made her leave him . Or if not that , then things will deteriorate simply because he ( and probably Jeanette , too ) are on their best behavior . They 've known each other , what , two weeks ? They 're as nice as possible , accommodating , as interesting and interested as they can stand to be . And though it 's genuine now , sure , he knows it ca n't be forever . He could n't possibly be genuinely interested in someone else for the rest of his life , could he ? So , for the moment , sitting in his car , watching Jeanette lock the store and adjust her scarf and head toward him within a clear circle surrounded by fogged window , all bundled up and now turning her brisk walk into a jog as she came toward the car-though whether to get out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure-right in this moment , he took the happiness he felt and swallowed . He leaned over , unlocked the passenger door , and pushed it open toward her . The air that rushed in was frigid , face slapping . He felt the past rush out . Jeanette is impossible to read until , halfway to him , he detects an extra skip in her stride . Even given half of this moment-say , if Jeanette were only to come within ten feet of his car and no closer-he 'd feel happier than he thought he would again , and happier than he 's been in at least a couple years . Jeanette is halfway to him , then halfway again , then suddenly she is inside the car , inside his car , Blakey 's car , Blakey 's hunk of junk , and her lips , freshly minted , are on his lips , his chapped lips , and her breath-cold tongue goes past meeting and takes only seconds before it , too , is warm like everything else . " Let 's go , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I could cut glass with my tits . " And he starts driving without knowing where to . FACT : Blakey is in love . FACT : Blakey is in love .
