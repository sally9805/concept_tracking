TYLER ARRIVED WITH THE horses February eighteenth , three days after the battleship Maine blew up in Havana harbor . He saw buzzards floating in the sky the way they do but could n't make out what they were after . This was off Morro Castle , the cattle boat streaming black smoke as it came through the narrows . But then pretty soon he saw a ship 's mast and a tangle of metal sticking out of the water , gulls resting on it . One of the Mexican deckhands called to the pilot tug bringing them in , wanting to know what the wreckage was . The pilot yelled back it was the Maine . Yeah ? The main what ? Tyler 's border Spanish failed to serve , trying to make out voices raised against the wind . The deckhand told him it was a buque de guerra , a warship . Earlier that month he had left Sweetmary in the Arizona Territory by rail : loaded thirty-one mares aboard Southern Pacific stock cars and rode them all the way to Galveston on the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this deal , Charlie Burke , Tyler 's foreman at one time , years ago . Charlie Burke introduced him to a little Cuban mulatto --  " Ben Tyler , Victor Fuentes "  - -  the man appearing to be a good sixty years old , though it was hard to tell , his skin the color of mahogany . Fuentes inspected the mares , none more than six years old or bigger than fifteen hands , checked each one 's conformation and teeth , Fuentes wiping his hands on the pants of his white suit , picked twenty-five out of the bunch , all bays , browns and sorrels , and said he was sure they could sell the rest for the same money , one hundred fifty dollars each . He said Mr. Boudreaux was going to like these girls and would give them a check for thirty-seven hundred fifty dollars drawn on the Banco de Comercio before they left Havana . Fuentes said he would expect only five hundred of it for his services . Tyler said to Charlie Burke , later , the deal sounded different than the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you did business in Cuba was the same as it worked in Mexico , everybody getting their cut . Tyler said , what he meant , he thought they were going directly from here to Matanzas , where Boudreaux 's sugar estate was located . Charlie Burke said he thought so too ; but Boudreaux happened to be in Havana this week and next . It meant they 'd take the string off the boat , put the horses in stock pens for the man to look at , reload them and go on to Matanzas . What Tyler wanted to know , and Charlie Burke did n't have the answer : " Who pays for stopping in Havana ? " That evening Charlie Burke and Mr. Fuentes left on a Ward Line steamer bound for Havana . It was late the next day Tyler watched his mares brought aboard the cattle boat , the name Vamoose barely readable on its rusted hull . Next came bales of hay and some oats , one of the stock handlers saying you did n't want a horse to eat much out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind the animals himself . That was fine with the stock handlers ; they had the cattle to tend . They said the trip would take five days . It was back toward the end of December Charlie Burke had wired : FOUND WAY TO GET RICH WITH HORSES . He came out on the train from East Texas and was waiting for Tyler the first day of the new year , 1898 , on the porch of the Congress Hotel in Sweetmary , a town named for a copper mine , LaSalle Street empty going on 10:00 A.M. , the mine shut down and the town sleeping off last night . Charlie Burke came out of the rocking chair to watch Tyler walking his dun mare this way past the Gold Dollar , past I.S. Weiss Mercantile , past the Maricopa Bank -- Charlie Burke watching him looking hard at the bank as he came along . Tyler brought the dun up to the porch railing and said , " You know what horses are going for in Kansas City ? " " Tell me , " Charlie Burke said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen each other in almost four years . Charlie Burke said , " Then we do n't want to go to Kansas City , do we ? " He watched Tyler chew on that as he stepped down from the dun and came up on the porch . They took time now to hug each other , Charlie Burke 's mind going back to the boy who 'd come out here dying to work for a cattle outfit and ride horses for pay . Ben Tyler , sixteen years old and done with school , St. Simeon something or other for Boys , in New Orleans , this one quicker than the farm kids who wandered out from Missouri and Tennessee . Charlie Burke , foreman of the Circle-Eye at the time , as many as thirty riders under him spring through fall , put the boy to work chasing mustangs and company stock that had quit the bunch , and watched this kid gentle the green ones with a patience you did n't find in most hands . Watched him trail-boss herds they brought down in Old Mexico and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years to work for a mustanger named Dana Moon , supplying horses to mine companies and stage lines and remounts to the U.S. cavalry . Watched him take over the business after Moon was made Indian agent at White Tanks , a Mimbreno Apache subagency north of town . The next thing he saw of Ben Tyler was his face on a wanted poster above the notice : $500 REWARD DEAD OR ALIVE What happened , Tyler 's business fell on hard times and he took to robbing banks . So then the next time Charlie Burke actually saw him was out in the far reaches of the territory at Yuma Prison : convicts and their visitors sitting across from one another at tables placed end to end down the center of the mess hall . Mothers , wives , sweethearts all wondering how their loved ones would fare in this stone prison known as the Hell Hole on the Bluff ; Charlie Burke wondering why , if Tyler had made up his mind to rob banks , he chose the Maricopa branch in Sweetmary , where he was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Charlie Burke said , " I come all the way out here to watch you stare past me at the wall ? " So then Tyler said , all right , because it was where LaSalle Mining did their banking and LaSalle Mining owed him nine hundred dollars . " Four times I went up the hill to collect , " Tyler said in his prison stripes and haircut , looking hard and half starved . " Try and find anybody in charge can cut a check . I went to the Maricopa Bank , showed the teller a .44 and withdrew the nine hundred from the mine company 's account . " " That 's how you do business , huh ? " " Hatch and Hodges owed me twelve hundred the day they shut down their line . They said do n't worry , you 'll get your money . I waited another four months , the same as I did with LaSalle , and drew it out of their bank over in Benson . " " Who else owed you money ? " " Nobody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , well , once we had the hang of it ... I 'm kidding . It was n't like Red and I got drunk and went out and robbed a bank . Red worked for Dana Moon before he came with me , had all that experience , so I offered him a share , but he 'd only work for wages . After we did the two banks I paid Red what he had coming and he bought a suit of clothes cost him ten dollars , and wanted to put the rest in the bank . We 're in St. David at the time . We go to the bank to open a savings account and the bank refused him . I asked the manager , was it on account of Red being Warm Springs Apache ? The manager become snotty and one thing led to another .... " " You robbed the bank to teach him manners . " " Red was about to shoot him . " " Speaking of shooting people , " Charlie Burke said , prompting his friend the convict . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wanted posters out on us . To some people that five hundred reward looked like a year 's wages . These fellas I know were horse thieves -- they ran my stock more than once -- they got after us for the reward , followed our tracks all the way to Nogales and threw down on us in a cantina -- smoky place , had a real low ceiling . " " The story going around , " Charlie Burke said , " they pulled , Ben Tyler pulled and shot all three of them dead . " " Maybe , though I doubt it . All the guns going off in there and the smoke , it was hard to tell . We came back across the border , the deputies were waiting there to run us down . " " Have you learned anything ? " " Always have fresh horses with you . " " You 've become a smart aleck , huh ? " " Not around here . They put you in leg irons . " " What do you need I can get you ? " " Some books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets from some fella he knows . " " You do n't seem to be doing too bad . " " Considering I live in a cell with five hot-headed morons and bust rocks into gravel all day . I 've started teaching Mr. Rinning 's children how to ride the horsey and they like me . Mr. Rinning 's the superintendent ; he says to me , ' You 're no outlaw , you 're just stupid -- a big educated fella like you robbing banks ? ' He says if I 'm done being stupid I 'll be out as soon as I do three years . " Charlie Burke said to him that day in the Yuma mess hall , " Are you done ? " " I was mad is all , those people owing me money I 'd worked hard for . Yeah , I got it out of my system , " Tyler said . " But you know what ? There ai n't nothing to robbing a bank . " He was back at the Circle-Eye riding the winter range , looking for late calves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other that hug , Charlie Burke felt the shape of a revolver beneath Tyler 's sheepskin hanging open . Stepping back , he pulled the coat open a little more , enough to see the .44 revolver hanging in a shoulder rig . " You have somebody mad at you ? " Charlie Burke speaking , as usual , through his big mustache and a wad of Mail Pouch . " You do n't ever want to win fame as an outlaw , " Tyler said , " unless everybody knows you 've done your time . There 're people who save wanted dodgers and keep an eye out . They see me riding up the street and think , Why , there 's five hundred dollars going by . Next thing I know , I 'm trying to explain the situation to these men holding Winchesters on me . I 've been shot at twice out on the graze , long range . Another time I 'm in a line shack , a fella rode right into my camp and pulled on me . " " You shot him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives looking for me . It 's the kind of thing never ends . " " Well , " Charlie Burke said , " you should never 've robbed those banks . " Tyler said , " Thanks for telling me . " They sat in rocking chairs on the shaded hotel porch , the day warming up , Charlie Burke in town clothes , a dark suit and necktie , his hat off now to show his pure white forehead , thin hair plastered across his scalp . In no hurry . He said , " If the market ai n't Kansas City , where you suppose it is ? " " I 'm trying to think , " Tyler said , sounding tired from a life of scratching by and those years busting rocks , his long legs stretched out , run-down boots resting on the porch rail . A saddle tramp , if Charlie Burke did n't know better . The boy had weathered to appear older than his thirty or so years , his light tan J. B. Stetson favoring one eye as he turned his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped forever with a gentle curl to the brim . " You 've been reading about the gold fields , " Tyler said . " Take a string up to Skagway , not a soul around last year , now there 're three thousand miners , a dozen saloons and a couple whorehouses on the site . I suppose put the horses on a boat , it 's too far to trail drive . I 've thought about it myself , " Tyler said , though he did n't sound fond of the idea . That pleased Charlie Burke , his plans already laid . He said , " You could do that . But if you 're gon na take a boat ride , where 'd you rather go , to a town where people live in tents stiff with the cold , or one that 's been there since Columbus , four hundred years ? " He saw Tyler smile ; he knew . " Has palm trees and pretty little dark-eyed girls and you do n't freeze to death you step outside . " " So we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thought of me because I 've been there . " " I thought of you ' cause horses do what you tell ' em . I recall though , " Charlie Burke said , still in no hurry , " your daddy ran a sugar mill down there , when you were a kid . " " The mill , " Tyler said , " what they call a sugar plantation . The mill itself they call the central . Yeah , I was nine years old the summer we went to visit . " " I thought you lived there a while . " " One summer 's all . My dad wanted us with him , but my mother said she 'd lay across the railroad tracks if he did n't book us passage home . My mother generally had her way . She was afraid if we stayed through the rainy season we 'd all die of yellow fever . Seven years later her and both my sisters died of influenza . And my dad , he came back to New Orleans to run a sugarhouse out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed in an accident out there . " Charlie Burke took time to suck on his chewing tobacco , raise up the chair and spit a stream of juice at the hard-packed street . " You recall much of Cuba ? " " I remember it being green and humid , nothing like this hardscrabble land . Cuba , you can always find shade when you want some . The only thing ugly are the sugar mills , black smoke pouring out the chimneys .... " " You have a feeling for that place , do n't you ? " " Sixteen years old , I was either going back to Cuba or come out here , and hopping a freight was cheaper than taking a boat . " " Well , this trip wo n't cost you a cent , and you 'll make a pile of money before you 're through . " Tyler said , " What about the war going on down there ? It was in the paper the whole time I was at Yuma , the Cubans fighting for their independence . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like a real war , " Charlie Burke said . " The two sides line up and shoot at each other . It 's more hit and run . The Cuban insurgents blow up railroad tracks , raid the big estates , burn down sugar mills , and the Spanish army , the dons , chase after ' em . You understand that 's what gives us our market , replacing the stock they run off or kill . Once I 'd made a few trips for a Texas outfit ships cattle down there , it dawned on me , hell , I can run this kind of business . No time at all I 'm living in railroad hotels and drinking red wine with my supper . " " Speaking of hotels , " Tyler said , " I spent Christmas in Benson . " " You visit Miz Inez ? " " I stopped in . " " Camille still there ? " " She married a railroad click , man hangs around freight yards with a ball bat . " " You wanted , you could 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to walk down a mustang . Listen , what I did for two days , I sat in the lobby of the Charles Crooker and read newspapers as far back as they had any . All the news , I swear , was about Cuba and how the Spanish are mistreating the people there . A correspondent named Richard Harding Davis saw whole villages of people taken from their homes and put in prison camps , where he says they starve to death or die of sickness . Another one , Neely Tucker , saw Cubans lined up against a wall and shot in the back , their hands tied behind them . At La Cabana , the fort right there in Havana harbor . This Neely Tucker said the wall had blood all over it and what must 've been a thousand Mauser bullet holes . " Charlie Burke said , " You read for two days , huh ? " " Any time now we could be going to war with Spain . " " We do , it 'll be a popular cause , wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see nothing wrong with that ? " " Not a thing , " Tyler said . " Only I read the main reason we 'd go to war 'd be to protect American business down there . " " And I hear the newspapers are the ones want war , " Charlie Burke said . " Print casualty lists and increase their circulation . " He sat up in his chair to spit a brown stream , some of it hitting the porch rail this time . " I guess we 'll have to wait and see what McKinley wants to do . There 's a war , you 'll be back selling remounts , ' less you volunteer and ride off with the troops . Get sent to Cuba to shoot at people you never saw before , some Spanish kids with no idea what they 're doing there . In the meantime , partner , what 's wrong with taking a string down to Cuba ? The buyer 's an American , Mr. Roland Boudreaux . You ever hear of him ? From your old hometown , New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Owns a sugar estate near Matanzas . You know where that is ? " Now Tyler was nodding and Charlie Burke knew he had him . " The sugarhouse my dad ran was south of there , near a place called Limonar . " " You 'll be right at home then , wo n't you ? How many mares can you put on the train by the end of the month , say around fifty ? " " Be more like half that , even with help . Hire some trackers out of White Tanks . You want ' em by the end of the month , huh ? " " How about Galveston the middle of February the latest ? " Charlie Burke brought out a billfold from inside his coat . " You sign the passport application -- I brought one along -- I 'll have it by the time you come to Galveston . " He handed Tyler a packet of U.S. scrip with a bank strap around it , the price of doing business already calculated . " That 'll cover your expenses , get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , you 'll have enough left to buy yourself some town clothes and a new hat . You are n't a poor workaday ranny no more , Mr. Tyler , you 're a horse trader . " Looking at the money , Tyler said , " What 's this man paying for range stock ? " " Hundred and fifty a head . " " You serious ? " " The man wants cutting horses to use for polo ; he 's a famous polo player . " " Who pays expenses ? " " We do . " " What 's it come to ? " " Let 's see , freight costs ? Train and boat would run close to thirty-six dollars a head plus feed , wharfage , loading , veterinary inspection . Get to Cuba there 's an eighty-five-dollar a head duty the Spanish make on horses . What 's that come to ? " Charlie Burke said , looking right at Tyler , wanting to see if he was as smart as he used to be . It took him maybe four seconds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doing ? " " I would n't be surprised you 're running guns , " Tyler said . He watched Charlie Burke turn his head to spit a stream . " You are , are n't you ? Jesus Christ , you 're filibustering , and that 's against the law . " Now Charlie Burke was shaking his head . " I 'm not joining the fight or stirring up insurrection , that 's filibustering . I 'm delivering merchandise , that 's all , as a business . This trip , a hundred and fifty shotguns . Two hundred Smith &; Wesson .44s , both the regular model and the Russian . Like the one you have if I 'm not mistaken , except these are copies made in Spain and shipped to Mexico . I 'm also delivering a couple hundred Krag-Jorgensen carbines , five hundred rounds for each weapon , and we 're throwing in a pile of machetes picked up used . " " You bankroll all that ? " " Their man in Mexico buys the arms . What 'd you pay for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bought it off a fella use to be in the cavalry . " " Their man in Mexico picked up two hundred brand-new for ten apiece , still had factory oil on them . " " Stolen . " " I imagine . All the weapons are bought in Mexico and shipped out of Matamoros . See , what happened , this particular Cuban sees me delivering cows , he asks me what side I favor in the revolution . I said well , if I had to pick one it would n't be Spain . He says what 're the chances of bringing his friend Maximo some guns ? " " Maximo Gomez ? " " Head of insurgents . How would I like to run guns for the rebels ? But as a business , without taking sides or contributing to the cause . There 's no outlay of money either . This delivery coming up will cost the insurgents about twelve thousand . So what they can do , they send a message to one of the sugar planters : Give us twelve thousand pesos or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peso being worth ninety-two cents on the dollar right now . They raise the money that way or get it from people supporting the movement -- Cuban cigar rollers in Tampa and Key West . Two-thirds of the money goes for the purchase of weapons , covers expenses and pays the crew of the cattle boat , the Vamoose ; and the rest we get for risking our necks . It 's against the law ; yeah , you can go to jail , but that ai n't as bad as if the dons catch you . You either get stood against a wall or they use the garrote on you : strangle you to death . " Tyler watched him rub the back of his neck , like he was feeling to see if he needed a haircut . " Half the crew of the Vamoose are Mexicans and half are Cubans , the kind of fellas you do n't have to worry about . They load the weapons aboard off a lighter and come up to Galveston for the cows and horses . There is n't much of a duty on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we ship fifty or so head and make a few dollars there . By the time the Vamoose gets to Matanzas the guns are underneath a deck covered with manure . We bring the horses and cows ashore , the Cuban custom inspector takes a quick look below and leaves with a few pesos but without getting anything on his shoes . So now the Vamoose heads east along the coast to where it 's been arranged to drop the weapons . A Spanish gunboat stops them beforehand , they can show they 've been inspected and cleared customs . " " You 've done this already , " Tyler said . " One trip with guns . The next one after this , the fella in Mexico is lining up a Hotchkiss 12-pounder and that Sims-Dudley dynamite gun . Artillery 's what the insurgents want more'n anything . Or machine guns . Get your hands on some machine guns , you can ask anything you want . " Tyler said , " I do n't see what you need me for . " " The horses . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'd have to pay for ' em . " " Come on -- why me ? " " This business makes me edgy and you have nerve . " " You think I 've done it ? " " No , but you 've rode the high country and had a price on your head . I feel if I 'm gon na break the law I ought to have a partner knows what it 's like , " Charlie Burke said , " somebody that 's et the cake . "
