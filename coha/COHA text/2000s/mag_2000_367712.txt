As Elian Gonzalez 's grandmas informed us this year , their clan sometimes displays affection by nibbling on each other . So when Elian 's grandfather Juan Gonzalez scooped the boy into his arms last week at Havana 's Jose Marti Airport , he kissed him and joyfully urged him , " Bite my ear , hard ! " Elian shyly buried his head in Juan 's neck , then revealed to his Cuban kin why he could n't chomp on his abuelo 's lobe : he had lost his two front baby teeth during the final weeks of his seven-month-long stay in the U.S. <P> But Fidel Castro is much more concerned with what the world-famous six-year-old acquired in the U.S.  --  symbolized by the black suede Pokemon chain Elian wore when he arrived from Washington , a capitalist contrast to the Young Communist Pioneer scarves that dozens of his shouting , flag-waving Cuban classmates donned to greet him . In a calculated show of political restraint , Castro did n't come to the airport to hail the pint-size icon . Instead , he broadcast a Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elpidio Valdes , the patriotic , machete-swinging colonel who tells children to eat their vegetables , brush their teeth , and recently exhorted them to march against Elian 's imperialist " Miami kidnappers . " It was a cuddlier reminder of the dour communique Havana issued earlier in the week , promising that Elian would become a " model child . " <P> The odyssey of Elian supposedly ended when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the Miami Cuban exile lobby 's bid to win political asylum for him ; and the boy and his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez , who had gone to the U.S. to claim him , were free to go home . Cubans like architect Ernesto Pasalagua , 67 , called Elian 's return " a great victory , just like the Bay of Pigs . " But this custody saga has proved to be more than an extended tit for tat . Just as Elian 's young mind will now struggle to reconcile the polarized worlds of Pikachu and Elpidio , he may have forced post-cold war politics to do the same . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba wears a beard , fatigues and an anti-gringo scowl . <P> But his elfin face may not be as visible anymore . Elian and his family will spend the next three weeks in a seaside Havana house , and officials plan to keep international media out of Elian 's hometown of Cardenas , ostensibly to let Elian get caught up in school so he can enter second grade in September . But critics in the U.S. warn that the quarantine is meant to deprogram Elian . ( If so , he 'll be used to it : the private school he attended in Miami , owned by a right-wing Cuban-exile leader , was just as dogmatic . ) Last week he used the luxurious house as a romper room , giggling at the bald head of his other grandfather Rolando , who had worn a shaggy wig in a video the family had sent to Elian in the U.S. , telling the boy that doctors had discovered a miraculous hair tonic .                   @ @
