ONE NIGHT IN 1989 MY WIFE AND I TOOK our son , aged six at the time , to see Ron Howard 's Parenthood . The movie starts sweetly and predictably enough , with Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen playing parents who are going crazy trying to get their kids into the family wagon for an outing . Then it quickly changes tone , with Martin 's teenaged niece ( Martha Plimpton ) telling her teenaged fiance ( Keanu Reeves ) that she would n't live with him " if the world were flooded with piss and you lived up a tree . " A little while later Keanu asks his future mother-in-law if she knows what a boner is , and assures her that he 's just straightened out her disturbed 12-year-old by telling him it 's all right to " slap the salami . " " You know , " Keanu adds , " you need a licence to buy a dog or drive a car , but they 'll let any butt-reamin ' asshole be a father . " It was n't the dirty words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than dirty  --  it was the movie 's apparent inability to recognize how jarringly mean the words were , how weirdly brutal they sounded coming out of the mouths of young people . It was a sensor , not a censor , that had been switched off in movieland that night . And not just in movieland . Lately I 'd been catching my six-year-old son saying things like " I 'm gon na bust your butt ! " and " This sucks ! " with pure elan and no hint of sheepishness , until I got on his case about it . He did n't recognize it either . ( In a way I would rather he had said fuck and run as opposed to butt and stayed . ) And now Ron Howard had come up with this . Parenthood ( with a PG rating ) was ostensibly about the hypocrisy of adults , but the movie-makers were too cynical or confused to acknowledge that the " honest " words they were having the kids say were a hypocritical bonanza . I figured that we 'd got about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral honesty when discourse like this could be shrugged off as humour . But last summer my son , now 16 , took me to see South Park : Bigger , Longer , and Uncut . The opening musical was astonishingly great  --  as good in its twisted way as the Belle sequence in Beauty and the Beast . And then the movie kept going , and I realized that when it came to the assault on civility , I had n't seen anything yet . That children today are less civil , at least overtly , than they were a generation ago is unarguable . Stand on a subway platform in the late afternoon , or walk past a schoolyard at recess , and you can gather all the anecdotal evidence you 'll need . The professional testimony is equally available . Shelly Rodney , who 's taught high school in the Toronto area for 33 years , says he 's noticed a tremendous change over that time , particularly in the last decade . " It 's not just the swearing in the hallways , which is terrible today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vandalism and graffiti , or even the truly new fact that you often ca n't look at kids today without them getting resentful and hostile . It 's the fact that they do n't know . They do n't know to be quiet in assemblies , or movies , which is n't just rude , it 's embarrassing for them and everybody . " In younger children the change is even more dramatic . Rodney 's wife , Laura , has been teaching elementary grades for a quarter of a century , and while she maintains that " kids are still kids , " she concedes that their concept of civility has changed . " in the elementary schoolyard you 'll hear " I do n't give a shit " or " Fuck off " regularly . The strange thing is , they do n't even know what it means , but they know it 's not nice . It 's not that they 're any crueller than they ever were , at least not the little ones  --  kids have always been cruel to each other  --  it 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough , about how they 're behaving . " Both Rodneys also make the point that the respect children have today for traditional authority figures , particularly teachers , has plummeted drastically . Last year my son had an older woman for a supply science teacher , and he and his classmates were shocked  --  and indignant  --  when she started throwing people out of the class for speaking before being acknowledged . " We even put our hands up before we spoke , " my son maintained . " But did you wait for her to call on you ? " I asked . He looked at me like I was speaking Sanskrit . Call on him ? The thing that characterizes this generation of children is n't its brazenness , though , or outspokenness or lack of respect  --  all of which were matched or trumped by the children of the ' ' 60s  --  but its almost casual aggressiveness . What raised its head in the movie Parenthood in 1989 has reached a kind of apotheosis in 2000 . By now butt and sucks are archaic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children that is very different from simple profanity , in the same way that shut up can be far more devastating than any list of mere swear words . If kids are n't more mean-spirited , the language they use definitely is . It 's traditional to blame this new rudeness on a triumvirate of whipping horses : parental absence ( both parents working , latchkey kids ) ; reduced behavioural standards or apathy among professionals ( i.e. teachers ) ; and , of course , the media . In other words , adult neglect . I think the crime of adults is more specific : I think we 've kidnapped kids ' culture , repackaged it and sold it back to the original creators , coalsto-Newcastle style . We 've done this under the guise of ceding popular culture to children , of disappearing completely from the cultural scene . But we 've hung around behind the scenes , and in the process we 've inadvertently taught kids to speak a new language crafted in our own immature image : the language of insult . Anyone wanting to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  the apparent disappearance of adults  --  only had to take a seat while the previews were running before South Park . There you would have seen trailers for three movies : Outside Providence , Mumford and Drive Me Crazy , all of which could have been watched ( with adult accompaniment ) by a child of any age . In fact , of the 27 movies showing at our local multiplex that afternoon , only two had an R rating and were off limits to children . Of the 25 remaining movies , five were adult-themed ; the rest were either about teenagers or children , or obviously aimed at them . In 1960 , for every ten movies aimed at adults , there were two children 's , or family , films . Today the percentages are reversed . In popular culture today , " adult " means pornographic ; in films , on TV , on the radio , teen- and child-centred culture has become the culture . If a kid wants to know how he should be acting , or how he does act , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader might label this one more rant about the media corrupting youth , but it 's not  --  in this case the media are just along for the ride . Because what a ten-year-old child sees on TV or in the movies is not " the media "  --  what he sees there is us , and what we think of him . A remarkable percentage of programs and films today reflect the way adults would like to see children , or the way they think children would like to see themselves . The result is a weird amalgam of verbal sophistication and emotional stupidity , the ten-year-old equivalent of Steve Martin 's " wild and crazy guy . " Kids in these entertainments ( the Home Alone and Problem Child series , for instance ) are meant to look smart and funny ; instead they look cynical and mean . With no firm moral touch behind the adult creator 's eyes ( except in rare exceptions  --  The Simpsons , Roseanne ) , children act in patterns that are morally confused and bizarre . Rudeness is seen as one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , civility is apparently a non-issue . The result , more often than not , is a conflagration of insults . It 's Billy Madison . It 's also baffling . Do we , as adults , think that this is what children are ? If so , we 're doing a good job of imposing our vision on them . That kids are influenced by this adult distortion is as inevitable as life mirroring art . Kids have always been attuned to the seductiveness of cruelty ( what Laura Rodney was alluding to when she said kids have always been cruel ) , even when that cruelty was primordial and forbidden , as opposed to trivialized . Now , with our inadvertent help , it 's cool to be cruel . The larger question is , why ? Why have we overseen the creation of a child-centred culture that not only distorts children , but also disenfranchises them ? Are we villains by design ? Or are we ourselves as lost as our kids ? The other day I was putting out the garbage when three or four kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to the school-bus stop . Two of the boys were jostling each other , and one pushed his buddy and ran away , lanky and grinning , the way kids do . His friend kept walking and yelled , " I 'm gon na put a cap in your ass , motherfucker ! " The first kid 's grin faded to something quizzical ; his friend was n't smiling . Something had been let loose in the air that both of them knew was different , but not how different . They felt wrong not just to me but to themselves , but they did n't know why . The response ? " Fuck off yourself , " the lanky kid said . They did n't know , because neither do we . A kind of moral autism has trickled down from parents regarding the fine distinctions that create a civil society . The cultural tuning fork no longer vibrates for kids , because it no longer vibrates for adults . " There 's less understanding now of how important social graces are , " says Debby Zeliger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Catholic Children 's Aid Society in Toronto for 20 years , " and more a sense of " I can say what I want , when I want , ' without any true understanding of the relationship between what 's said and the reaction it elicits from other people . I 'm not sure that kids are any ruder than they ever were , it 's just that they let the adults and the outside world see it more . We had more of a sense of the larger impact , that the world would fall apart if you said certain things in certain contexts . We knew that we could say certain things to our friends , but not to our mothers . " Indeed we did , so how did we come to forget it ? Our civil amnesia is evident not just in our garbled view of kids ' culture , but in the icons of supposedly grown-up culture . In real life you have the burgeoning institution of road rage ; in the land of pop consumption you have the talk show  --  both fuelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1975 would have been unthinkable ; but then in 1975 professional wrestling was still a fringe sport . ) Paradoxically , talk shows are cast in the schoolyard-brawl model , with guests encouraged to act like children and insult each other . Except that children do n't insult each other that way ; they 're never that leaden or contrived . ( Unless , of course , they 're imitating the children they 've seen on TV , or in the movies , or on talk shows . ) Kids left to their own devices will be cruel the way fish swim  --  naturally . " You ca n't play , " a kid will say , and consign another to the hell of the outcast , and himself to the role of bully . At least that was the case till now . Today a kid will say , " I 'm gon na put a cap in your ass , " and dehumanize himself and anyone listening . Kids have weapons of insult now they 've never had before , weapons they do n't even vaguely understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . This is n't to say that a child ca n't be blunt , or outspoken , or even profane ( with a peer ) without being rude . I 've heard kids talk back to adults and been heartened by it . ( I 'll never forget a certain eight-year- old camper telling a director , " No way , Jose ! " on being informed that he had to change his underwear at least twice a week . ) In fact , any parent knows that it 's harder to teach a timid child licence than it is to teach an obnoxious one restraint . But what 's hardest of all to teach to someone who 's been weaned on an ageless , undifferentiated culture , is a sense of fine moral distinction , a sense of discrimination that makes inappropriate behaviour obvious . What 's hardest to teach , without sounding like a prehistoric artifact , is the idea of civility . How , again , have we come to this pass ? What accounts for our own lack of moral touch ? Somewhere in the vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scent of fear . Fear that if we fail to control every aspect of our children 's lives they 'll have the chance to be real children on their own ( a dangerous idea ) . Fear that if we differentiate between that which is for adults and that which is for children we 'll be forced to become true adults ourselves ( an even more dangerous idea ) . Fear that if we do n't make culture homogeneous there will be areas of it we may never have access to again ( the scariest idea of all ) . Take the afternoon my son took me to South Park . For anyone who is n't acquainted with the film , it 's about a group of kids in a " redneck mountain town " who become enamoured of a movie called " Asses of Fire , " starring a pair of Canadian twits , which teaches them to swear even more appallingly than they already do . The adults in the town , scandalized by their kids ' language , declare war on Canada . Take away the feces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of censorship . But I kept having flashbacks to Parenthood , because at the centre of South Park is a dishonest hole wide enough to drive a truck through . What the adults in the town are objecting to are n't the words , but the effect behind them . The kids of South Park are n't simply profane , they 're mean . They 're rotten . They 're little jerks . They 're more cynical and less attractive than any of the adults they 're supposed to be lampooning . If the grown-ups are a tad excessive in declaring war , they 're absolutely right to be up in arms . Their position is the correct one . The fact that they 're rigid , anal-retentive and a pain in the ass does n't mean they 're not right . They 're sensors , not censors , which is what we need to be again , too . To have civil children , it 's not enough for parents to learn to be civil themselves . We have to learn to be adults . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
