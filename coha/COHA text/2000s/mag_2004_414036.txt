Recent movies like 50 First Dates probably have you loss . of what you have seen . // Memory loss seems to be the hot topic onscreen , with Drew Barrymore putting Adam Sandier through 50 First Dales ( in the flick , she suffers from a rare condition in which she wakes up every morning with amnesia ) and Jim Carrey blotting out painful memories of his ex in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . And this month , Matt Damon returns in The Bourne Supremacy , about a hunky secret agent with one teensy problem : He ca n't remember who he is . All of which leave you , the viewer , sitting there in the dark , looking up at the screen and asking yourself , Could that ever happen to me ? Do n't Believe What 's on the Big Screen The reality is that everyday people really do lose their memories , say experts . But while amnesia makes for high Hollywood suspense , in the real world , memory failure is pretty uncommon and , when it does occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown in a very sensationalistic way , " says Lawson Bernstein , MD , assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine . " But those portrayals do n't have much basis in fact . " While complete amnesia ( the wiping out of a lifetime of stored memories ) can and does occur , it 's almost unheard of , Dr. Bernstein says . Clinically , amnesia is defined as memory loss-short- or long-term-and can be caused by a variety of factors , from brain damage , illness , or shock to drugs , alcohol , stress , or the always cinematically popular blow to the head . The common thread running through all of them is that each factor , in some way , attacks the hippocampus , a ridge alongside each lateral ventricle of the brain that processes memories . But how amnesia typically manifests itself has been-surprise ! - wildly exaggerated by Hollywood . Exhibit A : secret agent Jason Bourne , who 's had his memory wiped out thanks to anasty head injury and bullet wounds . While that could indeed lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in no shape to run around the world chasing bad guys . " Anyone who suffers that kind of severe brain trauma would not be coming back and functioning like a secret agent , " says Dr. Bernstein . " He would have serious motor impairments that would hamper his performance . " And pixieish Lucy Whitmore , who makes poor Adam Sandlerwin her heart over and over and over in 50 First Dates ? The daily memory loss she experiences ( in the movie , it 's the result of a car accident ) is pure fiction . The closest thing to it is Alzheimer 's , the degenerative , memory-robbing disorder that affects an estimated 4.5 million people in the ILS. , almost all of them over the age of 60 . How People Get Amnesia A significant clunk on the head can cause temporary memory loss , but " if someone suffers a mild concussion , the chances that their memory will return to normal in a few days are quite good , " says Dr. Bernstein . However , if the injury is more serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all depends on what part of your brain was injured and how badly . In cases where ; a person is assaulted or has survived a traumatic experience , the brain is under attack on two fronts . The first is physical damage to the hippocampus from the head injury . In addition , a psychological reflex can literally shut down the brain after an event that 's too traumatic or frightening to deal with , such as a rape or witnessing a brutal crime in childhood . The brain , in effect , locks the memory away until the person can face it . This latter scenario is called hysterical amnesia and can sometimes take years to conquer . " With this type , the person usually ca n't remember the period right before or immediately after the trauma , " explains Mark Levy , a forensic and general psychiatrist in Mill Valley , California . " The memories associated with the event are too painful to recall , so a person suppresses them . " In milder cases , overwhelming stress can also trigger hysterical amnesia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a grueling seven-hour court deposition in which he was continuously verbally attacked by an attorney , later lost any awareness of where he had driven . " He did n't remember getting into his car and driving afterward , " says Dr. Levy . " He had been on the road for 30 minutes and did n't know where he was . " The good news is that total recall is possible . " With the use of psychotherapcutic techniques like hypnosis or biofeedback , a person is often able to get those memories to return , " says Dr. Levy . " There are also some practical methods , like showing them photos or objects reminiscent of the forgotten portion of an event , " that can bring lost memories flooding back . Still , the overwhelming number of cases of non-Alzheimers memory loss can be attributed to one thing : a night of hard partying . While you 'll lose memories of only the period during which you were sloshed ( alcohol basically short-circuits the brain s temporal lobes , the filing cabinet for shortterm memory ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irreversible damage to memory . In other words , your mother was right : Drinking too much kills brain cells , and it can eventually lead to atrophy of the hippocampus . For example , Dr. Bernstein recalls treating an alcoholic pilot who flew drunk all the way from the East Coast to the West , safely landed the plane , and later did n't remember doing any of it . Pill-Oh ! Talk These days , the biggest talk-show buzz around erasing memory is the intriguing idea that it can be induced , a notion introduced in the Jim Carrey movie . " It 's an interesting concept , " offers Gary Small , MD , director of the Memory Clinic at UCLA and author of The Memory Bible . " I think we are going from science fiction to science . It 's something that is probably feasible in the future . I ca n't tell you when . " Dr. Bernstein agrees : " I think what you might see is some sort of genetic manipulation of the brain in which you can selectively alter certain areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of surgery like what is shown in the movie would be like killing a fly with a cannon . It would get the fly hut leave a lot of collateral damage . The person would he a vegetable in terms of memory . " Recently , beta-blockers have been bandied about on every cable talk show as the shortcut to erasing painful memories , but experts warn not to believe the hype . " I do n't know of any chemical eraser drugs , " says Dr. Levy . " Beta-blockers were originally developed to treat high blood pressure and coronary artery disease . Because they block the adrenaline receptors , they can also be used as antianxicty agents . " So if you 're hoping to make your life with Mr. Wrongdisappearwith the pop of a pill , the experts have two words for you : Forget it .
