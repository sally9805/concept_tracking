When Pia walks into his flat in Bombay , she thinks it 's a joke . She looks up at Adil , the man she has agreed to marry , waiting for him to ask the rightful occupant of this miniature box to step out of his hiding place . <p> " So what do you think ? " he says , mistaking her smile for approval . <p> Her instinct is to pick up her bags , say no thanks-this was meant to be romantic-and return home to Delhi . But Adil looks so proud . <p> " I like the windows , " she says . <p> " Really ? " <p> She unzips her bag and takes out a fresh T-shirt . He offers her a hanger . Pia wonders if she should move to her girlfriend 's house , which , in any case , is where her father thinks she 's spending the weekend . <p> It is n't just the room 's tininess or squalor . It 's the impermanence , the essentials thrown together with no design . The largest object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows . A curry-stained stove rests on a counter along the wall , its umbilical cord connected to a gas cylinder . No telephone , no air conditioner . The only features are the waist-to-ceiling windows on two of the four walls . Half-open , they draw in the saltiness of the Arabian Sea , the smell offish and damp gutters . <p> Pia asks for the key to the toilet , more to compose herself in private than out of necessity . She moves down the hallway , unlocks the toilet door , and squats over a simple hole in the ground . The stink of human waste hangs in the air . Her thigh muscles twitch ; she steadies herself . Pia ca n't help but think of Adil 's room . Had he noticed her hesitant step that could neither go forward nor turn back ? Crossing the threshold meant giving up a way of living , all those high standards she had been schooled in since childhood . Good breeding , her father called it . <p> Yet the ugliness of his place has already begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the time she crept into the servant quarters at the back of her house and lay for hours curled up on a thin , soiled mattress . <p> Pia met Adil six months ago when he was in Delhi modeling for a condom advertisement and she was studying journalism . He pressed his fingertips against her many books , marveled aloud at the knowledge encoded in her brain . Before he knew her , Adil confessed , he 'd done cocaine , freeloaded on women , posed nude for money- " Now , " he said , " my ass is hanging in black and white in some rich faggot 's dining room . " <p> Then , during a hiking trip to Ladakh , she agreed to marry Adil . A week later , she informed her family . <p> " What does he do for a living ? " her father asked . <p> " Adil 's an actor . And he is n't rich or anything . " <p> " Oh , " her father said , too self-conscious to take on the role of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . At twenty-three , you 're mature enough to know who to spend your life with . " <p> Some part of her was disappointed by his tempered reaction . <p> Now , Pia wonders if she is being foolish . There is a loud thud on the toilet door . " Arre , hurry up , or I 'll su-su in your Kelvinator . " The knob wriggles like a netted fish . <p> The neighbor , Mackrand , she guesses . Adil has told her about him . <p> " Stop playing with yourself , bhenchod , save something for your rich girlfriend . " <p> Pia pulls up her panties . She can hear Adil 's voice in the hall , then the neighbor 's . " So who 's in there ? Some slut ? " <p> Pia stands with her hand curled around the knob . She does n't want Adil to witness her embarrassment . She collects herself and , a moment later , steps out . A stocky man with a towel around his bare shoulders faces her . <p> Mackrand smiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances up as Adil approaches . " Aaay , give me an intro to her , yaar . " <p> Pia avoids Adil 's eyes and wipes her hands on her jeans . " I 'd better go back . " She motions to his room . <p> " Man , she 's much taller than her photo . She looks like a cross between Kareena Kapoor and Preity Zinta . Fair and innocent . Sexy , too . " <p> Pia shuts the door . The baby-blue Kelvinator stands in the corner like a spectator ; fruit flies hover around its sticky frame . Adil has unpacked , folded her clothes away in his closet . He comes in as the kettle on the stove steams . <p> " Tea ? " he turns the heat off . <p> " Why did n't you say something to him ? " She already knows : it 's because Mack has set him up with some big-shot director . <p> Adil looks at his feet , a sulky droop to his lips . " Mack 's like a brother to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could have said anything . " Pia realizes this could become an excuse to move to her friend Maya 's house . " You just stood there like a chicken , " she says . <p> " Look , I 'm sorry . It wo n't happen again . " <p> She allows Adil to put his arms around her and rock her gently . His spontaneous affection surprises her , like a sudden rain , and she soaks in it . By comparison , her parents ' kisses are dry , careless brushes against her cheek . <p> Adil goes to the counter , picks up a tall steel glass of tea , and holds it out to her . It is cupped in his palms like an offering . <p> " Sit , " he says , and pulls a chair toward her . <p> She takes a seat . The tube light makes her feel like they 're in an examination hall . " I need to call home . " " I 'll take you downstairs . We can go to the beach after that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cook some fish . " <p> " I 'm not hungry . " <p> " Eat something , no ? " Adil selects a coconut from a stack . He slices the crown off with a butcher 's knife and empties the liquid in a glass . She sips slowly and watches him . He is beautiful-tall with narrow hips . His lean body is almost hairless ; tight muscles define his shoulders and legs . His face is oval , widest at the cheek-bones , tapering down to a square jaw . He has dark eyes and a protruding , wet mouth , like a fruit . <p> Adil carves the milky flesh from the shell in bite-size pieces and feeds her with his fingers . <p> " Shush , " says Adil , when they reach the landing where the landlord lives . " Uncle does n't allow women to stay overnight . " Pia smiles and puts a finger on her lips . Invisibility is new to her . She takes exaggerated steps , hums the Pink Panther tune in her head . <p> When they reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying guest : an up-and-coming veejay who calls herself Fleur . <p> " Adil talks about you all the time . Everything is always Pia-says-this and Pia-does-that . " Fleur speaks in a birdlike voice . She wears pink hipsters that show off her pierced bellybutton . <p> " I 've heard about you as well , " Pia says , though she has n't . Adil rarely talks about his female friends . <p> " Really , like what ? " Fleur turns to Adil and ruffles his hair . Her gunmetal eye shadow accentuates her light eyes . <p> " Only your finer qualities , do n't worry , " he says . " Pia needs to call Delhi . She 'll pay for it . " <p> " All yours , " says Fleur . <p> Pia dials the number on the ancient phone . She watches Fleur , the way she jokes with Adil . Her body sways into his-one bump for every sentence . <p> Adil and Fleur talk about the film industry : no work these days , bullshit money . Arre , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it 's flopped . Producer gave Twinkle the role ' cause she 's Dimple 's daughter . Big name , influence and all , so what do you expect ? And who the fuck lip-synched for her , just horrible , yaar . <p> On the phone , Pia 's father picks up . " Where are you ? " he says . <p> " Your cell phone is out of range . " <p> " At Maya 's house . " Pia cups the receiver to block the noise . <p> " Uncle 's been looking for you , " Fleur says . " He wants rent . " <p> " I 'll deal with it , " Adil says quickly . Mack walks into the room . <p> " Janeman , " he whispers into Pia 's ear , and presses a hand to his heart . <p> She tries to concentrate on her father 's voice . " Our filly runs on Sunday in Bombay . Hope you 're going to be there . " <p> " Adil , you 're on for the screen test Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Fleur cocks her head to one side and sticks her finger at Adil . <p> " You 're the man ! Is n't he , Mack ? " <p> Mack scrapes his ear with a hairpin . " The chutiya 's not a man , he 's superman . " <p> " Is your friend Adil joining us ? " Her father will be coming to Bombay the day after tomorrow for the annual derby . He 'll stay at the Oberoi Hotel , two hours from Adil 's flat in Lokhandwalla . <p> " Yes , " she says . " We 'll both come . " Adil laughs . " Fleur , you have the MTV act nailed . " <p> " Yo ! " Fleur jumps in the air . Her breasts jiggle and then settle in her tank top . <p> " I 'll send a car for you , " her father says . " You know that Adil needs to be properly dressed . What 's that racket in the background ? " <p> " The television . I 'll call you later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adil . " My father is sending the car to pick us up on Sunday . " <p> " A Porsche or a striped Jaguar ? " Fleur says , sucking the tip of her thumb . Adil tries to hide a smile . <p> " Neither , actually . " Pia feels dowdy in her tailored pantsuit next to Fleur . " Adil , we should leave . I want to get to the beach before dark . " <p> " Do n't mind her . She 's not potty-trained . " Mack pins Fleur 's arms behind her . " Stop by when you come home . " Home ? The word rattles in her head . <p> Juhu Chowpatti is nothing like a beach . The sand is filthy . Jagged seashells poke out like warnings . The only people in the water are squatters shitting or washing their laundry against salt-bitten rocks . Adil and Pia sit on plastic bags , shelling roasted peanuts , inventing ways to describe the sea . <p> " The waves roll toward us , " Pia says , " like huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves roll toward us like a forming thought . " <p> " Nice . " She thinks of how they 'd watched the blue waters of Pangong Lake in Ladakh turn a mysterious emerald at noon . Adil had asked her to recline on the shore to pose for his camera , but the photographs mostly showed her long fingers interlacing across her face . Now , she turns toward Adil and surprises herself by kissing him . <p> " There 's Kareena Kapoor , " an impish beggar boy screams . <p> " Aay-haay , Kareena is giving Akshay Kumar a chummi ? A group of potbellied boys form a circle around them , tittering like thin-legged chicks . Adil lifts his arm and chases after them . <p> " Let 's go . " He looks impatient . <p> They walk against the wind . Lame ponies pulling carriages trot at their heels , the drivers begging them to take rides . On the slope above , overlooking the sea , the homes are mini-fortresses surrounded by barbed wire and gunmen . They remind Pia of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adil says , " we can move into one of those . " <p> " And in the meanwhile ? " she says . Adil likes to talk about his future . <p> " You can redecorate . " <p> " I ca n't live like this . In these sort of conditions , I mean . " <p> He does n't reply at first , just looks out at the horizon . " Okay , I 'll join Dawood 's gang as a hit man and buy you an eight-bedroom apartment . Happy ? " <p> She grins . " Only if all the rooms are sea-facing . " <p> " How about if I build you a houseboat ? Great view even when you take a shit . " <p> " How about if I say get famous first ? " <p> " Pia , you ever taken the ferry ? Come on . " <p> She and Adil squeeze into a rickety wooden boat , squashed among mothers and children in synthetic clothes , half-asleep cows , sweaty workmen , and motorcycles . Adil looks at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drone of the engine . <p> " Remember when I met you at that pool party ? " he says . " I was dripping wet , and you stood there , this graceful woman I hardly knew , listening to my crazy ideas . " <p> " You 're lying . " Pia strokes a sleepy cow on its neck . <p> At night , Adil drags the mattress to the floor so they can lie side by side . The table fan does n't keep the mosquitoes away-they 're like a net around her . Adil faces her , the blanket bunched around his heels . His skin is tanned and glossy , except for the birthmark on the rise of his hipbone . The mosquitoes do n't touch him . Familiarity maybe . <p> Pia keeps her cotton nightdress on . Sleeping naked , she has been taught , is inappropriate . Having sex is n't appropriate , either . Sex is the mysterious blackout in Hindi movies , the missing frames after rain-swept song-and-dance sequences , the lovers ' clothes wet with longing . <p> But lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or blow-dried hair . As a kind of game , he shows her how to tear open condoms with his teeth . Pia pokes her thumb into the condom 's sticky mouth , laughs , shakes her head , and watches Adil demonstrate different sexual positions . " For posterity , " he says . He rolls on his back and pulls her on top of him . Pia giggles . She bounces up and down . She can feel him beneath her , sense his desire , but of course it is only make-believe . Pia knows how to control herself . " It 's not right , " she says . " I feel dirty . " She is a decent girl , a virgin , the type men want to marry . <p> Pia returns Adil 's overtures timidly at first : stroking his chest . When it feels safe , her tongue traces a slow line to the bottom of his stomach , pausing where the dangerous dark hair emerges . " But what will you think of me ? " she says when Adil asks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore , so what ? I 'll say it right now , you 'll be a whore , a slut , a cheap rundi ... " <p> " Stop it , " she says . <p> " Your father 's not watching , " he tells her , placing his hand between her legs . " No one cares over here . " <p> The morning sun floods the room like a searchlight . The sound of the sea , the water 's tug of war with land , is unfamiliar . Heat sinks into her . Adil has left without waking her . She lies between the clutter of clothes and bedding and last night 's dirty dishes . The shadow of a palm tree flickers across her body like a reptile . If a man , say Mack , should come in and drag her by the hair to the toilet , rape her , and throw her into the opaque sea , no one would know . <p> The streets below are narrow and wounded , teeming with beggars and stray dogs eating litter . Shacks sprout behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes . Lokhandwalla smells like a ghetto . But the advertisements still accumulate like obstinate desires , attached to streetlamps and dilapidated houses . It 's the neighborhood of strugglers : kids who were conditioned to be engineers and doctors , but flocked to Bombay determined to reinvent themselves into Shah Rukh Khan , or disco kings like Govinda . Adil 's no different . His father was clubbed to death in a workers ' strike when Adil was thirteen . But he does n't like to talk about the past . " That part of me , " he has told her , " is dead . " <p> Pia pictures her own father in his black satin pajamas and embroidered slippers . He laughs over her mother 's latest antics-her foolish fear of cats , her failing memory . He and Pia are the intelligent ones : a team . Then she thinks of Adil . When he meets her father , Adil wants to ask ridiculous questions about his beginnings , his struggles , his business strategies , the road to riches . She tries to remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattress she slept on feels hollow . Even so , she wants to lie here forever , to vanish into the dirt and clutter all around her-lose herself . She looks out the window and sees a hijra lurking on the neighboring terrace . The hermaphrodite walks with one hand on her torso , swaying her thick hips . Her hair hangs in thin spikes over her brightly painted , manly face as she hides beneath the clothesline and chews her betel leaves . If the hijra gets caught in a decent home , she will be beaten . She spots Pia staring and spits juice at her . The shiny red saliva spatters against the window . The hijra lifts her sari , threatening to display her double sex , then disappears behind the drying clothes . <p> A moment later , Adil comes in , holding paper plates . He wears tight Levi 's and rubber Bata slippers . He puts the food down and throws himself on her , kissing her palms . Her skin feels damp under his lips . " You 're still here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ? " says Pia . " On the moon ? " <p> " Yes , on the moon , but you 're still here . " He wraps one arm around her neck , nibbles the tip of her nose . <p> How easily she surrenders to his affection , sinking into his lap , cradled , whispering nonsense-baby talk . She ca n't help herself , and it scares her . Pia strikes out at him . He ducks her blows , eyes half-closed , amused , still holding her firmly and planting kisses in between the violent gestures . <p> Adil pushes her to the ground and pulls down his jeans . She removes his penis from his underwear and squeezes , feeling its pulse as her thumb reaches its smooth tip . She inhales his smell , the curious essence . " Fuck , " Pia says in a throaty voice she does n't recognize . He tries to free his dick from her hand , but she will not let go . She watches him wince as he pries open her fingers , stubborn tentacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and encircles her wrists , placing her arms on either side of her head . He hesitates as he looks down at her . <p> " Do n't think , " she says , and pulls him inside her . <p> Her body yields to Adil 's weight , the shock of his immersion . She feels him rise and fall inside her . Behind him there are half-open windows and unknown streets , and beyond that acres of deep sea . Nothing seems impossible . She feels the suck and swell of water ; tastes its salt on her tongue as she bites his skin . <p> " Ouch , " he says . <p> The plain sound of Adil 's voice makes her wholly aware of lying here pierced and naked . Adil 's face comes closer . It seems twisted , as if in pain . He is so close his black pupils smear into a single gaping eye . " You look creepy , " she whispers . <p> He stops , still inside her . <p> " What ? " <p> " Talk to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you sad or happy , you know , just tell me things . " <p> " You already know about me , you mad woman . " Adil places his hands under her hips and lifts her toward him . " So I 'm creepy ? " <p> " I did n't mean it like that . Just your eyes . Can we go on ? " <p> Adil raises himself on his arms and begins to move quickly . She hardly recognizes him as he punches into her . <p> In the afternoon , Adil takes Pia to watch a platform skit at Prithvi Theatre . He stands behind her , his arms fitted comfortably around her waist , and she leans back against his body . After the performance , they sit in the cafe . Fleur smokes a joint and talks to Adil . " I gave a blowjob , the works , and the chutiya still said no . That 's what a loser I am . " <p> " I think you 're a great veejay , " Adil says , and squeezes Fleur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to compose a clever reply , something that will make her belong . " You can do better . Fuck him . " <p> Fleur sneers and stubs out her cigarette . " Yeah , right . What the hell would you know ? Adil , want to watch Zadugar tomorrow ? It 's free . " She waves two tickets at him . <p> " Ca n't . I have my screen test . " He practices a fight move : a left jab . " Just watch , Natraj is going to launch me . I feel it in here . " He thumps his heart . <p> " Do the test first , then- " Pia begins . <p> " Wowie ! " Fleur says , cutting her off . " My Aby-baby 's going to be a superstar . " <p> " When I get famous , " Adil tells her , " I 'll make you queen of veejays . " <p> Fleur claps her hands and then hugs Adil . " I love you , you fucker , you know that ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what to do , Pia looks away . <p> On Saturday evening , Pia goes with Adil to Film City . Mack waits for them outside Natraj Studios . " You 're late , " says Mack . He spits his gum and opens the door for her . " Welcome to our funtastic abode . " <p> The rumbling sound from the industrial generators makes the sweltering space seem alive , as though they were inside some huge ravenous beast . Thick black tubes snake around the walls . Stage lights stud the ceiling . A shapely , baby-faced actress bedecked in a shimmering sarong reads a Hollywood magazine . Beside her , a pudgy man wearing a lime green suit sits surrounded by his sidekicks . Adil and Mack join the circle . Spot boys weave through , serving glasses of tea . <p> Pia listens to Adil talk to the man . " It would be a great honor , Natrajji , if you could give me a small chance to work under you . " His voice is sweet and hopeful . <p> " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pia . " Would she like a small chance , too ? " He sputters into laughter . <p> " Oh , no , sir . Pia is my fiancee . " Adil gives her a little push . She steps forward . <p> " Nice choice , " Natraj says . <p> Pia has the urge to slap his baboon face-inform him exactly who and what her father is . For Adil 's sake , she stays silent . <p> Natraj shifts his weight . " Okay , the story is boy loves girl , parents create a big hungama , couple elopes , then some bukwas , let 's see , few songs , dances , and a happy ending . " He pats the actress on her bum . " Shilpa , go do a sequence with our hero . Let 's get some action . " <p> Shilpa stretches her arms languidly . The magazine on her lap slips to the floor . Kareena Dumped ! the cover reads . " Where 's Tiny ? " she says . <p> A midget carrying a makeup kit follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch , gives it to Pia , and steps onto a jungle-like set . A backdrop of snowy mountains and trees flickers on the wall . The dance tutor hops around him , demonstrating the steps . Adil faces the camera and stares ahead at some distant spot that is secret and urgent . For a brief moment , Pia sees him detached from the ordinary , like a painting , exquisitely framed and held up to the light . When Adil stumbles over a word , she feels responsible . When he delivers a line with ease , it 's as if he has spoken only to her . <p> A technician asks Pia to move . " Your shadow 's in the way , " he says , and makes her shift to a corner . She sits on an abandoned prop and glances around . Mack walks up beside her . Pia is grateful ; she pinches his arm and grins . <p> The set thunders , the roof pours rain . A disco beat unfurls from the speakers . Fog machines cloud the stage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes her eyes , rotates her hips . Tiny jumps onto the director 's chair , unbuttons his trousers , and mimics her movements . The crowd of extras hoot and shriek . <p> Maybe he will be a star , Pia thinks , watching Adil 's lips slide over Shilpa 's quivering , wet navel . And what will I be ? <p> Adil slithers up Shilpa 's body and lip-synchs to a love song . <p> The next day , her breakfast is placed on a turquoise dish embellished with white daisies . Adil has his eggs on a paper plate . He eats fast , does n't daydream or shift his food around . The fork 's trajectory is a straight route : into his mouth and out again to stab the eggs . Adil finishes , then lies down , his head propped by his elbow . They 'd had sex again , and now he gazes at her , as though nothing she can do will disappoint him . <p> " What ? " Pia says . " I ca n't eat if you stare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picks up her left foot and kneads the sole with his thumbs . " You eat like a bird . " <p> There is a knock at the door , then a man yells , " Adil , are you there , beta ? " <p> " Oh , shit , " Adil whispers . " One minute , Uncle . " He pulls on his shorts . Be quiet , he signals to her , and goes out to the corridor . <p> The landlord 's voice is only slightly muffled by the closed door . " Last month 's is overdue , mister . I 'm not a charity , you know . " <p> " I 'll pay by tomorrow latest , Uncle . I 've even asked for those passes for you and Aunty to watch the shooting at Sun and Sand Hotel . " <p> " I heard a girl 's voice last night , " the landlord says . " You know the rules . No hanky-panky in my house . " <p> " There 's no one here , Uncle , by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delhi . " <p> A door slams in the hallway . " Adil , shweety , " Mack teases , " why are you standing here in your phunky knickers ? Yaar , put on a tie , there 's a producer-looking guy asking for you . I told him to come upstairs . " <p> Pia hears sharp , measured footsteps . Instantly , she recognizes them . Her heart clenches . <p> " Is Pia here ? " asks a familiar voice . <p> " Mr. Burman , sir , " Adil says . " Yes , but let me tell her you 're here . She 's resting . " <p> Pia feels a sickness inside her as if she is falling from a great height . It ca n't possibly be him , she thinks . <p> " Sleeping till noon . What is she , ill ? " says Uncle . <p> " May I go in ? " says her father . <p> Adil opens the door , and her father faces her . Pia tries to sit up , but her body does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt inside-out , no makeup , her hair disheveled . For a moment , her father looks uncertain , as though he wants Pia to be someone else , not his daughter , sprawled on the floor . She expects him to back out in horror . But he stays . <p> " I thought I 'd stop on my way from the airport and pick you up myself , " he says , averting his eyes almost casually and looking out the windows . " Your friend Maya said you asked for the car to be sent here . " <p> " Yes , I came in the morning , " Pia says in a choking murmur , and then sits up , holding the sheet tightly around her chest . She can smell his lime cologne . Its fragrance floats around Adil 's room and turns it back into the tiny box she walked into . <p> Her father straightens his silk tie as if to set everything in order : the damp heat , his half-naked daughter , Adil in his underwear , the gutter stench , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pia searches for something to say .

" <p> " Yes , I am . " She wishes he would growl or scream , slap her , drag her out of here , do what he needs to do . But he will never be tempted into forgetting who he is . <p> A small , balding man with owl-eyed spectacles now stands at the entrance . " So this is your real sister ?

" He takes out 10,000 rupees stapled together with a bank sticker . " Will this do ? " <p> The money lies on the counter like a weapon . Uncle stares at it , his fingers pocketed deep in his trousers . <p> " It wo n't be fair to accept this , sir , " says Adil . <p> " Well , this is hardly the time to be concerned about being fair .

" <p> " No , I 'll wait for you , " she says , because it seems the right thing to say . Pia slips on a sweater over her shirt and buttons it . <p> Her father studies his watch . " I 'll go ahead , then . Why do n't you follow when you 're properly dressed ? " <p> " Mr. Burman , sir , I 'm really sorry about all this . I 'll return the loan . " <p> " Forget about it .

Pia tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unmanageable emotion that topples under its own weight . <p> Kabhi Kabhi plays on the radio in Mack 's room . Pia waits in the corridor for Adil to lock up . Mack 's door is ajar . He lies on the floor staring at the ceiling , arms and legs spread wide , as if he 's on a crucifix . His large , watery eyes flick to the side . " Hey , Queenie , " Mack whispers . Pia looks away and hurries downstairs . <p> She and Adil climb into a yellow and black rickshaw . " Mahalaxmi Racecourse , chalo phatafat , " he tells the driver . The open flaps allow the dust rising off the road to strike their faces-no tinted windows to buff out the glaring sun . A beggar boy chases after the rickshaw , his bare feet slapping against the hot tarmac . <p> Pia wonders where she 'd be if she had n't met Adil . Gossiping with family at Sunday brunch ?

" <p> " You probably use the same lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting her legs back down . Despite his softness , she realizes Adil is tougher than she is . He knows how to move on . <p> Their rickshaw halts abruptly at a major intersection . Coca-Cola billboards tower over the fuming traffic like new gods . A cart stops alongside them . It has shutters on three sides and a barred peephole . School children sit silently in the dark . They stare out onto the street , their tiny fingers poking through the gaps of the mesh wiring . <p> " Look at that , " Pia says . " Like chickens being sent to a slaughterhouse . " <p> He glances at the children . " They look happy . " <p> As happy as we do , she thinks . <p> The driver cranks up a hit tune . He shakes his head and hums along . <p> " You liked Zadugart " Adil asks him . <p> " Wah ! What a phlim , " the man says . " Aamir Khan has double role , eleven songs , and tiptop dancing , but fighting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pia , let 's go see it tonight , " Adil says . <p> " Do n't you understand ? For God 's sake , he caught us . He knows . " <p> " So ? " <p> " What if it were your father ? Then how would you feel ? " <p> " My old man is dead . " Adil stares at the moving white stripe on the road and starts singing along with the driver . <p> When they reach the racecourse , Pia joins her father in the owners ' paddock , and they watch his filly , Secret Treasure , trot by . The diamond design on her father 's midnight-blue tie matches his gray flannel suit . Pia stands near him ; her shoulder touches his arm . She is foolishly satisfied with her father 's appearance . He is tall like Adil , but his features have a harder , authoritative look . <p> Secret Treasure waits to be mounted . She strikes a practiced pose : left leg forward , ears pricked , head held high , sun hitting her smack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie third or fourth , " her father instructs the young jockey . " Make your run in the straight and do n't try any tricks . " <p> Pia smiles at his advice . Always practical . Do what you know and get home free . <p> Adil waits for them at the gate to the paddock . " You were late for the fourth race , " her father says . " Mystique won by four lengths . I had a big one on her . " <p> " That 's great , Mr. Burman . " Adil shakes his hand . " Sir , who do you think will win the main event ? " <p> " The bookies are pretty hot on my filly . Two-to-one favorite . " He looks at the race book . " The colt Indictment could cause a few hiccups , but I 'd say the field 's fairly clear . " Her father takes out his wallet . " Place your bet at the first enclosure , they give better odds . And here , put 20,000 rupees on Win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads toward the bookmakers ' ring where the serious punters in their old jeans and Terylene shirts stand . <p> " Pia , you look exhausted , " her father says . " I hope you have n't caught something . You have to be careful of your health . " <p> " I 'm fine . " <p> " You do n't look fine to me . " He turns up the collars of Pia 's shirt , removes a stray thread stuck in her hair . " What you need is a warm bath , a nice clean bed , and some rest . No more vagabond nonsense . Now let 's go to our box and order you a drink . " <p> " What about Adil ? They wo n't allow him in the members ' enclosure without us . " <p> Her father and she stand in awkward silence . Pia stares at a pair of men walking past her . Kabir Oswal : 24 , single , chauvinist , heir to Oswal Steel . Jeh Mehta : 27 , married , unfaithful , source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crisp suits , monogrammed shirts , and veneered faces . Pia imagines Fleur in her pink hipsters and pierced bellybutton among this jeweled crowd . She envies her . <p> When Adil returns , her father leads the way to the long , white balconies on the second floor that perch over the track . " I borrowed 4,000 rupees from Mack . I 've put it all on your horse , number four , " Adil tells her . " Damn thing better win . " <p> Her father stops to greet friends before they sit down . " Pia , you sit in the middle , " he says , placing her between Adil and himself . <p> The Topiwallas , an old Zoroastrian family , have the box in front of them . It is designated by a brass nameplate . They own the chestnut colt Indictment . The large family sits as though enthroned there by nature . <p> " Good luck , " her father says to old Mrs. Topiwalla . " May the best horse win . " <p> " May the best horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wears the same canary-yellow creecirc ; pe de Chine dress every time her horse runs . " I ca n't say exactly how my Indictment knows , but he always does his level best when I wear this lucky outfit . " <p> " You 've met my daughter , Pia , have n't you ? " <p> " Of course . And what a lovely girl she 's become . " Mrs. Topiwalla waves a finger toward Adil . " And this is your ... " Her eyes scan the skinny knot of Adil 's tie , the absence of cuff links on his sleeve , a coffee stain at the kneecap of his khaki pants , his bulky white socks . The valuation , Pia thinks . <p> " Oh , he 's a friend who lives here in Bombay , " her father says . <p> Mrs. Topiwalla pulls out a scented tissue from a tin and dabs her neck . " Well , good luck all . " <p> Pia looks up at the suspended monitor and watches the horses move into the gates . Adil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shifts her right leg and nudges Adil 's elbow from her thigh . He is talking too much . Nervous chatter . Her father sits back in his chair , his left foot tapping the floor , and listens . Pia tries to visualize what her father must think . How melodramatic Adil is . How he speaks with his hands , his features vibrant , his voice too loud . <p> A shrill bell rings . Her father adjusts his binoculars and leans forward . The gates open . Under starter 's orders ... they 're off , says the commentator . A storm of pounding hooves move past the boxes , and the jockeys ' colors flash kaleidoscopically in the sunlight . The horses bunch together galloping along the mile-and-half track . Mrs. Topiwalla shuts her eyes . She keeps them closed during the race , says it 's too much pressure . As the field hits the straight it 's the pacemaker Baywatch ... followed by Arabian Rose ... hotly pursued by Aerogramme and Indictment close behind on the rails . The hurried tempo of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... found a gap ... <p> Adil stands up and yells , " Secret Treasure-move your butt ! " <p> The Topiwallas glare at him . " For God 's sake , " Pia hisses . <p> " Sorry , sorry . " He places a finger on his lips and sits down . <p> In the homestretch it 's Indictment followed by secret ... quickly making ground . <p> The crowds in the first enclosure press themselves against the railings of the track and yell out the favorite 's name . <p> Her father shouts , " Come on , Secret Treasure ! " <p> Pia follows his lead and stands up . Mrs. Topiwalla mutters a cryptic prayer . She wonders if old Mrs. Topiwalla has ever played puppet with her thumb stuck up a condom . It 's Indictment and Secret Treasure running neck ... Pia wants to ask her : " Does your lover blush when you brush those huge teeth ? " Secret Treasure is pushing ... she 's giving it all she 's got ... <p> " You can do it , baby ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the horses gallop past the boxes ; dust from their hooves rises like a funeral fire . It 's Secret Treasure and Indictment still Secret Treasure and Indictment . Pia wants to ask her , " Have you cleaned a window stained with a hijra 's red spit ? " Mrs. Topiwalla sticks her fingers into her ears . Tell me , old woman , have you ever tasted the sea ? Yes , oh yes ... the hot favorite ... Pia watches Secret Treasure stick her head forward , just a nose ahead of Indictment as she races past the finishing post . <p> Her father slaps his hand against his knee . " We did it ! " <p> Adil lets out a whoop and kisses Pia , then embraces her father . " It 's quite all right , thank you , " her father says . He smoothes his hair , excuses himself , and hurries down to lead his filly into the paddock . Photographers surround him . Acquaintances try to catch his eye . The crowds do a little jig , and throw rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Wah ! Burman sahib ! Well done , Secret Treasure . " <p> " Let 's cash the booty , " Adil says . He leads Pia downstairs to the bookmakers ' ring . The bookies sit on high stools . Desperate punters clamor around their knees as though they were selling a non-stop fare to heaven . Adil gives the man his slips . <p> The bookie glances down and hands them back . " Sorry , no good . " <p> " What do you mean ? My horse-number four won . " Adil points to the chalked results on the long blackboard behind him . <p> " Mister , your number four has n't even seen the track yet . Your bets are on the next race . " The man sighs . " Odds are fifty-to-one . What are you ? A fortuneteller ? " <p> Adil looks confused . He opens his mouth , then shuts it again . <p> " I ca n't believe this , " Pia says . All the confusion she had felt in his room is balled into a mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' snide remarks , watched you flirt with every woman in sight . I was ready to give up everything to be with you . And you ca n't place a simple bet . You ca n't even pay your own rent . How the hell do you expect me to marry you ? " <p> Adil 's eyes are empty . <p> She is going too far , but she wants to go even further-get Adil to do what she can't-make him shake her by the shoulders and say , This wo n't work , I 'm leaving . <p> " That was all Mack 's money , " he mumbles . <p> " What about my father ? " she says , working herself up . " What 's he going to think ? " <p> " What about me ? " says Adil . " How do you think I feel ? " He tosses the slips in the air . " You people think you know it all , do n't you ? Money , horses , fucking suits and ties , but what about love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop shouting . This is n't some stage set , " she says , and turns to leave . <p> Pia joins her father behind the track at the stables . The filly stands sweating ; a white residue where the saddle had been stains her bay coat . <p> " You should write a little essay on the race for college , " he says . <p> " Yes , Papa . " <p> Flies buzz around the horse 's head . Her eyes are dilated , and she breathes heavily . Pia puts her arms around Secret Treasure and buries her face in the animal 's neck . <p> " I 'm going home , " Adil says , when he catches up with her after the prize ceremony . " What 's your plan ? " <p> " My father and I are having tea at the hospitality tent . " She shifts the enormous silver trophy to her other arm . " I 'm staying with him at the hotel tonight . " <p> Adil 's arms hang at his sides . " I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She thinks Adil might turn around , but he does n't , and then he vanishes into the crowd . Left alone in the paddock , she listens to the amplified voice of the commentator declare the day 's winners and losers . <p> Her father reads a novel : The Other Side of Midnight . He pushes his gold-rimmed glasses firmly against his nose . She 'd like to speak to him about Adil , tell him how she feels so she can make sense of things . <p> Pia fiddles with the knobs of the piped hotel music located on the console between the twin beds . <p> " Turn down the noise , please , " her father says . <p> Pia switches it off . " So , what did you think of Adil ? " she says before he can resume his reading . <p> " Decent chap , " he says , without looking up at her . <p> " Then you like him ? " <p> " It 's not a question of like or dislike . A man is known by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged by ... by the dignity she keeps . At least that 's how I 've tried to bring you up . What I saw this morning , well , you could hardly call that place a garden . " <p> " Adil loves me , does n't that mean anything ? " <p> He looks at her curiously , as if the notion of love is something she has invented . " Darling , if you think you can live happily ever after in a filthy box , then go ahead . The decision is yours . " Her father reaches to turn off the light . " Good night , " he says , his words harmonized with the click . <p> Pia turns to her side and hugs the pillow . The linen has a scratchy texture , as if no one has ever slept on it . If this were a movie , she 'd climb out the window , desperate to join her banished lover who 'd wait below singing some melancholy song . They 'd dance like Laila and Majnu under the moonlight , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups of poison . <p> The hotel operator has put the line on DND . Pia wonders if Adil has tried calling . She misses rubbing her toe against his leg ; she misses the weight of Adil 's body behind hers , his hand cupped resolutely around her breast . <p> The air conditioning deadens the sound of traffic on Marine Drive , the main road which wraps around the shoreline . Adil says the city was once small islands , but greedy developers had pumped out the sea and dumped earth in its place until the land ate up the water . An unearthly green light from a neighboring skyscraper blinks at her . The windows are still wet from the evening 's rain . <p> Pia goes to the bathroom , sits on the toilet seat , and checks the messages on the operator . Nothing from Adil . <p> She looks at herself in the mirror and pulls a face . " How lovely I have become , " she says , mimicking Mrs. Topiwalla 's British accent . The fat hotel towels look tempting . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home free , she sings to a made-up tune , as the water splashes into the tub . <p> Her cell phone rings in the silent , dark bedroom . Pia runs and gets it . She looks at the flashing number . It 's Adil . <p> " Why is your line on Do Not Disturb ? " <p> " My father 's sleeping , " she says , walking back to the bathroom . <p> " I was going to mail this letter I wrote , but Mack says I should read it to you . It 's not elegant or anything . It 's just about me , how I feel , okay ? So no sarcasm . " <p> " Just read it . " <p> " Okay , here goes : It has stopped raining , and the sun from behind the clouds is making everything in my room look yellow . I can hear crickets outside , and I want to tell you about this small village in Assam , where I lived with my family . " <p> I do n't want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It rained ten months in the year , and there was always this diffused light , which makes me remember all this in black and white . There was never any electricity , and our home was lit by kerosene lamps . They have a thoughtful flame that made everything look graceful , and during my bath , I 'd love to watch the water shimmer down my skin . " <p> Sentimental , but she knows what he means . Soft towels lie at her feet . <p> " In the evening , the drives on my father 's scooter felt like victory laps . I was nine years old , and I rode in front with him , holding the handles . The roads were hilly and winding , lit dimly by the scooter 's headlights . We could hear the hum of grasshoppers and crickets and fireflies , it was as if God ( if there is one ) had lined them up like an orchestra along the road to sing for us , and the darkness ahead made it seem like we could go on forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and curses him silently . Just when she had made up her mind , he talks about forever , about miracles . <p> Adil pauses . " There 's more , but you 'd call it silly . I 'll read it anyway . I wonder what put me in this time capsule ? Maybe the crickets outside my window . But now they are gone , and there are too many mosquitoes . That 's all I want to say . Tell your father I 'm sorry . " <p> She can hear Mack 's voice in the background . " Yaar , let me say hi to Queenie . Is she coming with us for the film ? " <p> " I have to go , " says Adil . He hangs up before she can say a word . <p> The hot water overflows in the shallow tub , and the rising steam blurs the mirror she is looking into . " I am a lovely , lovely girl , " Pia says to herself . She engraves her full name on the smoky mirror . Lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clear lines . She imagines herself with Adil , Fleur , and Mack with all his crazy talk , telling her to stop by . How successful Adil and his friends are , living alone , independent , and Pia is furious at herself for who she is . <p> Pia enters the bedroom , the numbing air-conditioned darkness . Her father 's eyes are shut . He makes no sound . She walks to the windows and pushes the shutters open . A strong wind hits her face , whips through the thin fabric of her nightgown . Leaning over the sill , she watches the waves roll in , full of hope and vigor , only to break against the rocks and wash away again taking bits of the shore as they retreat toward some invisible future . Tireless motions . If it were possible , if only for a brief moment , she would set the sea free , release it from the pull of gravity , the dutiful opening and closing . <p> She turns around . Her father still sleeps . Stripped of consciousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . His head droops off the side of the pillow into his chest ; a strand of spit worms out from the corner of his half-open mouth . For a second , she thinks she has somehow killed him . Her fingers tighten into an unbreakable grip , determined to wake him ; and she shakes his body so hard that her whole world seems to shake with him . <p>
