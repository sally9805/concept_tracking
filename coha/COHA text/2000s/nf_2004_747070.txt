Section : Features : Bolivia Prospects for Bolivia 's popular movement <p> It is too early to tell if Bolivian opposition leader Evo Morales represents the nation 's political past or future . Morales 's Movement Toward Socialism ( MAS ) - which he and supporters assiduously avoid calling a " party " - finished a stunning second in the June 2002 presidential election , with almost 21% of the vote . This brought it just short of the 22.5% obtained by the National Revolutionary Movement ( MNR ) , the closest thing to a dominant party in Bolivia since the 1952 revolution . The MAS won four of nine departments , 27 congressional seats and eight of 27 senatorial seats . Together with other indigenous representatives , the MAS makes Bolivia 's the most indigenous congress in Latin America . After the election , the movement and its allies stood to control almost 50% of the legislature , a startling turnabout that consolidated Morales 's emergence as a national figure . <p> But by January and February of 2003 , yet another round of nationwide protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash between the army and police ) sparked by a new IMF-imposed 12.5% income tax hike left a reported 50 dead and hundreds injured . Triggered by MAS-led protests , the unrest was one more skirmish in the growing resistance to neoliberal policy in Bolivia after 18 years with no discernible trickle down . Amid the fallout of Bolivia 's " Black February , " then President Gonzalo Snchez de Lozada accused Morales of a failed coup attempt . After the violence and despite sporadic " dialogues " ostensibly to resolve the intractable problem of Bolivia 's coca growers , relations between Morales and Snchez de Lozada became severely strained . More clashes followed in October , culminating in Snchez de Lozada 's resignation . From Union Organizer to Opposition Leader <p> Morales 's career as a legislator has been checkered by the entrenched resistance of Bolivia 's mostly nonindigenous , elite and technocratic parliamentarians to his presence among them . The 2003 coup accusations continued a public relations battle begun when Morales was thrown out of congress in January 2002 , despite having been duly elected in 1997 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a recent New York Times article put it , an " upstart coca-chewing Aymara Indian , " along with the US Embassy 's refusal to work with him or to recognize him as a legitimate representative , have aggravated the situation . <p> Originally called the Political Instrument for Peoples ' Sovereignty , the MAS formally appeared in 1995 . But only since the 2002 elections has it leapt from the marginal left to the center of Bolivian politics , in the process again calling attention to the highly contentious question of the Chapare coca growers and Bolivia 's US-backed and funded coca eradication program . The MAS was born out of the now two decades old , low-intensity war pitting Bolivia 's militant coca growers against US-trained Bolivian police and military personnel . The coca growers have waged this war through militant agrarian unions , using direct action protests such as roadblocks , hunger strikes , mass marches , public rallies , sit-ins and the occupation of local government or NGO offices . <p> First formed in 1953 , the Chapare unions were galvanized by an influx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard guru Jeffrey Sachs - and their storied history of radical unionism . By 1985 the unions had supplanted the highland Aymara kataristas as the vanguard of the national agrarian union movement and wielded influence in the national hierarchy of the Bolivian Worker 's Union ( COB ) . Morales grew up in the impoverished obscurity of rural highland Bolivia . After his year of compulsory military service , he migrated in 1979 from his highland village to the Chapare , where he was elected to his first local union post two years later . In June 2003 , he was elected to a fifth term as maximum leader of the Six Federations of the Tropics in the Chapare ( approximately 35,000 strong ) , a post he has held since 1988 . His political base remains , without doubt , the coca growers . But whether Morales can successfully walk the tightrope between national legislator and grass-roots leader remains a crucial question . <p> Given the deep suspicion with which Bolivia 's disillusioned public regards its political establishment , Morales presents the MAS as an alternative to the vertical politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is evident in the MAS 's structure , half " political party " and half " social movement . " At the national level , the MAS is often indistinguishable from many other ephemeral political coalitions in which it participates and takes a guiding hand . What organic structure the MAS has is expressed through a changing number of " cabinets , " formed on an ad hoc basis to develop positions on key issues . At the most local level , the MAS becomes inseparable from the local union structure itself . Where it has won elections , it is the provincial municipal bureaucracy , exercising authority through effective use of the government 's own 1994 Popular Participation Law . <p> Morales emphasizes that the MAS " does not have its own separate structures " but is run more or less directly from the grass-roots level and the coca growers ' praetorian guard in the Chapare . MAS legislators do not claim to be politicians or even representatives ; they are , rather , " messengers " to congress , " spokespersons " for a base-driven consensus that emerges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to report . As opposed to the procedural democracy of the congress , the MAS functions as an assembly-style democracy rooted in local unions . Morales claims that for the MAS to become the " primary political force in Bolivia " it need not win the presidency in 2007 . <p> Instead , his goal is to take up to 70% of local municipalities in the 2004 local elections . The Question of Sovereignty <p> Perceptions of the coca growers as intransigent , isolated and issue-specific are misleading . The projection of the MAS 's influence beyond Chapare local politics continues the coca growers ' long-term strategy of courting other union movements and political parties on the left , including participation in other social movements and alliances with human rights groups , foreign NGOs , the clergy and sympathetic social scientists . In the early 1990s , for example , Morales was a vocal critic of NAFTA , was active in the 1992 anti-quincentenary campaign and appeared on the ballot for the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize . Recently , the MAS proved an effective participant in the Water War of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the coca growers remain the power base and vanguard of the MAS , the movement has attracted other social sectors , including labor unionists and intellectuals of the former left . With the momentum of a post-neoliberal backlash , the MAS is evolving into a plural coalition that cuts across and potentially unifies the popular sectors hit hardest by structural adjustment since 1985 . Displacement is a key unifying feature of the MAS 's growing constituency . This trend began with the original settling of the Chapare and continued with the influx of relocated miners . It is now reflected in the MAS 's popularity among both peri-urban dwellers - mostly rural migrants to peripheral communities lacking in basic services who work in the " informal " economy - as well as highland peasants resettling in lowland Santa Cruz and mobilizing to obtain land grants . <p> As international awareness of the coca growers has increased , their leaders have begun to travel regularly to Europe , Japan and the United States to attend meetings with foreign NGOs , participate in activist congresses , hold speaking and informational tours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US War on Drugs . One dimension of Morales 's success has been his activism in transnational social networks dedicated to such interconnected issues as pan-indigenous rights , environmental conservationism and resistance to economic globalization . Since his first trip abroad in 1989 , Morales has become Bolivia 's most well-traveled politician , making close to 100 trips abroad as a representative and symbol of Latin America 's " original nations " to the world . <p> Critics have routinely sought to portray Morales as one more in a familiar line of populist demagogues without a coherent plan for the country 's future , misleading a gullible electorate with an ideological hodgepodge of anarchists , Guevarists , indigenists , Trotskyites , leftists and Maoists . But if Morales 's public discourse is peppered with references to Ch , Castro , the Zapatistas and Lula , and if the MAS has in fact courted Bolivia 's traditional left , Morales can not be defined simply as a left-leaning populist . Matters are more complex , at once reflecting the fact that indigenous political issues are now much more a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a broader electorate , and the fact that the new wave of leftists in Latin America is decidedly more pragmatic than its 1960s forebears . <p> The main platform of MAS and Morales , the " struggle for dignity and sovereignty , " is not simply an echo of the hemisphere 's pan-indigenous struggle - represented in Bolivia by the writings of Fausto Reinaga - but a calculated challenge to a failing neoliberal regime . In December 2002 , at its first national meeting , the MAS developed a referendum that included a rejection of US policy in Bolivia , the hot button topics of Bolivia 's gas reserves and moribund mining industry , and the contentious questions of land and coca . But it also took positions on a social security fund for retirees , judicial and health care reform , inadequate pay for teachers , and the need for greater regional economic integration in Latin America . The MAS is not a one-issue , one-sector rural phenomenon . <p> Perhaps most important in Morales 's post-neoliberal agenda is the notion of " sovereignty , " which has multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses and customs " of Bolivia 's indigenous peoples , for which the traditional consumption of coca leaf ( not of cocaine ) has become a symbol . Morales and the coca growers emphasize an " Andean " heritage as intrinsic to Bolivian national identity . For them , the effort to eradicate Bolivia 's " sacred leaf " is a direct assault on Bolivian cultural heritage and a violation of Bolivian national sovereignty by the US . <p> Morales is also a radical Bolivian nationalist , defending his nation 's sovereignty against US interference and to prevent the loss of " national patrimony . " He opposes construction of a pipeline that would send Bolivia 's natural gas deposits through Chile , arguing that the gas would be better used at home to help domestic industries and create needed jobs . Sovereignty is also at the root of his opposition to the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) . Morales has insisted that the FTAA would amount to the " annexation " of the region for US economic interests and extend a standing invitation to loot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lula , Morales has stressed the need to optimize existing regional economic blocs such as MERCOSUR and in international forums has urged the realization of Bolivar 's vision " for the freedom and construction of one great nation in Latin America . " <p> Gone are the days when Bolivia 's government could play popular movements off each other , as it routinely did with mining and peasant unions in the past . Morales and the MAS are not just about coca . Their message of sovereignty , patrimony and collective cultural and citizenship rights resonates with members of Bolivia 's popular sectors , both rural and urban , whose lives have gotten more difficult in recent years . Meanwhile , international and civil society networks make it harder for the nation 's politicians to dismiss the MAS . It is their long-term appeal among the urban , indigenous-descended and disillusioned popular majority that should determine the political future of the MAS and Evo Morales , and eventually , Bolivia itself . The Future of Bolivia 's Democracy <p> The tensions clustered around Morales 's polarizing figure reflect the systemic paradox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morales 's current instrument to work from within Bolivia 's legislative process . It potentially validates the flexibility of Bolivia 's political system to accommodate - some might insist " co-opt " - dissenting political outsiders . In this light , the MAS phenomenon can be viewed optimistically as part of a gradual process of democratic enfranchisement of Bolivia 's popular and indigenous majority . Yet , blocked by a shaky government pact , internal dissension , and rivalries with other indigenous and popular leaders , the MAS 's legislative efforts to " refound the country " have instead foundered . As Morales himself often claims , the MAS is much more effective when it " governs from the streets , " using direct protest strategies . But the parade of blockades , demonstrations and other collective opposition strategies is both frustrating and paralyzing to many Bolivians , who simply want an end to their nation 's seemingly perpetual economic and political crisis . <p> Lamentations in Washington about Latin America 's " turn to the left " give the impression that impatience with free-market policies has brought Latin American politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left of the past , as illustrated by Evo Morales and the MAS . He may incline to the left , and he is a manifestly popular politician , but Morales practices a more pragmatic and pluralistic brand of politics , as the Bolivian and US governments would do well to recognize . MAS tactics effectively dramatize the polarities of incomplete democracy in Bolivia , caught on the horns of dialogue or violence , ineffective legislation or effective street protest , discredited political parties or grassroots unionism . <p> The fall 2003 protests that drove Snchez de Lozada from office , leaving almost 80 people dead and another 500 wounded , were sparked by the plan to export Bolivian gas to the US via Chile . An expression of profound popular disenchantment like the Water War before it , the " Gas War " focused demands relating to citizen sovereignty , including clarity in coca eradication laws , rejection of the FTAA and opposition to a new Citizen Security Law . A vocal leader in the Gas War , Morales reiterated the coca growers ' previous demands but insisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he positioned the movement as a " constructive opposition " that lost no time exerting its influence on a new government formed without traditional political parties , pledging to battle corruption and to hold a popular referendum on the nation 's gas reserves . Morales and his allies gave it 90 days . <p> The main platforms of MAS and Morals , the " struggle for dignity and sovereignty , " is not simply an echo of the hemisphere 's pan-indigenous struggle but a calculated challenge to a failing neoliberal regime . <p> He may incline to the left , and he is a manifestly popular politician , but Morales practices a more pragmatic and pluralistic brand of politics . <p> MAS ALLA DEL MAR ( BEYOND THE SEA ) , a frill-length documentary on the Mariel boatlift , premiered on the opening night of the Made in Miami Film Festival , January 10 , 2002 , at Miami 's historic Tower Theater . Produced , filmed , and edited by Lisandro Prez-Rey , with support from FIU 's Cuban Research Institute and the Ford Foundation , the 80-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mas Alia del Mar presents the story of one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of human migrations . In a few short weeks in 1980 , nearly 130,000 Cubans left their homeland in an unrelenting stream of vessels bound for Key West . More than two decades later , the personal stories surrounding the boatlift , filmed for this documentary , continue to resonate with an energy that can only be described as surreal , powerful . Weaving together these riveting stories along with rare historical images and footage from present-day Cuba , this film recreates the " explosion of 1980 , " a crisis that shook Cuban as well as American society .
