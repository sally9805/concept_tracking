WITH ONE ELBOW propped on her desk , Peyton MacGruder chewed on the edge of a fingernail and glared at the clock on the wall . On days like this , when she was twenty minutes away from her deadline and far from finished with her column , she could swear that the minute hand swept over the clock face at double speed . <p> She transferred her gaze to the computer monitor and fluttered her fingers over the keyboard . Some days the magic worked and the words flowed . Other days she might as well be typing gibberish . <p> She skimmed the half-completed column on her screen and tried to focus her thoughts . Last week a reader had written that she was afraid to trust a brother-in-law who had stolen from her in the past . Peyton had answered that forgiveness was important , but experience could not be ignored . And when it came to matters of the heart , caution should always trump passion . Dozens of readers had e-mailed , filling her in-box with responses , most of them supportive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader comments , but everything she 'd written so far looked like extended self-congratulation . She needed a corroborating opinion ... and any column could be improved with an appropriate quote , could n't it ? She reached for her dictionary of popular quotations , scanned the index , and jabbed her finger at an appropriate entry . Smiling with satisfaction , she propped her reading glasses on the end of her nose and worked the quote into her piece : <p> And so , dear readers , when it comes to dealing with relationships , perhaps we should keep the words of Eumenides in mind . That venerable sage once wrote , " There are times when fear is good . It must keep its watchful place at the heart 's controls . There is advantage in the wisdom won from pain . " <p> Perhaps a happy heart is , at its core , a cautious heart . <p> There . She leaned back and clicked the word count tool . Seven hundred words-not bad . The dragon lady should n't have to cut any of this column . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed the file to Nora Chilton , senior features editor . Another click and away it went . <p> She turned as something slapped the surface of her desk . Mandi Hillridge , an overenthusiastic intern from the University of North Carolina Wilmington , stood in the aisle , her arms filled with folders . Peyton picked up the envelope Mandi had tossed her way and studied the return address . " Am I supposed to know this Eve Miller ? " <p> Mandi shifted her burden from one arm to the other . " I doubt it . I think she 's a reader . " <p> Peyton ran her fingertip across the ragged edge . " Why has this letter been opened ? " <p> " Because Phil Brinker did n't check the address before he tore into it . Our stellar mailroom staff mistakenly delivered it to him while he was in New York working on that story about the media covering the media . He just got back and told me to bring it to you . " Mandi stepped closer , her eyes gleaming . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mailroom ? One of them 's kinda cute . " <p> Peyton glanced over the short walls of the reporters ' cubicles and saw Nora stepping out of the elevator . " No . " She propped both elbows up on her desk . " I want you to get me two Tylenol . Extra strength . " <p> " You have a headache ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> Mandi turned in time to see Nora approaching , a folded newspaper in hand . Even from her desk Peyton recognized the distinctive banner that contained her byline and staff photo . Had Nora come down to complain about a column that had already run ? She would n't , unless one of the higher-ups sent her to confront Peyton about some obscure point . <p> " About that headache- " Mandi lowered her voice- " I 'll bring the bottle . " <p> The young woman hurried away as Nora approached Peyton 's desk . The editor waved the paper before Peyton 's anxious gaze and nodded . " By the way , about this column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's a nice change . " Peyton managed a smile . " About what ? " <p> " Passion . It should always be tempered with caution . Especially when it comes to affairs of the heart . " <p> Peyton straightened in her chair , not certain why the editor had felt compelled to personally deliver this bit of elaboration . " You speaking from conviction or firsthand experience ? " <p> Nora managed a coy smile . " None of your business . Anyway , you 've been doing really good work lately . I had my doubts at first , but you 've grown into the job . " <p> " You came all the way down here to pat me on the back ? " <p> " Actually , I came down here to tell you that in addition to writing the Heart Healer , I 'm going to need you to handle a feature or two for the Lifestyles section . We got the call last night ; Marlo Evans had a baby boy , so she 'll be out on maternity leave for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to her hand and groaned . " Why not use freelancers ? " <p> " Because I do n't have the patience or the finances to deal with neophytes . The budget cuts have made it necessary for all of us to pick up the slack now and then . Besides- " her mouth curved in a wry smile- " you 're fast and you 're good at researching . A feature or two should n't be a problem for you . " <p> " But I 'm swamped with- " Peyton swallowed the rest of her complaint as sports editor King Danville moved into her line of vision . A warm feeling settled in the pit of her stomach and brought a smile to her lips . Would she ever stop feeling all gushy and girly whenever King approached her desk ? <p> King glanced at the features editor before returning Peyton 's smile . " Hello , Nora . " <p> Nora 's chin dipped in a stiff nod . " Kingston . " <p> Like a flower seeking the sun , Peyton shifted to face the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was just telling Nora that these days I do n't have time to keep up with my column and write a weekly feature , no matter how occasional it is . " <p> Nora glanced from Peyton to King and then arched a brow . " Perhaps if you temper your newfound passion , you 'll find the time . " <p> King grinned as the editor smiled and moved toward the elevator ; then he pulled a white bottle from his jacket pocket and shook it . Peyton placed the familiar rattle within seconds : Extra Strength Tylenol , as requested . <p> " Ran into Mandi in the coffee room , " King explained . " She said you were going to need these . " <p> " She was right . " Peyton sighed . " Nora seems to think I can sit down and whip up a decent feature while I 'm outlining my next column . I do n't know where she got the idea that I 'm some kind of writing machine . " <p> " Maybe from the fact that you write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're moving backward . " <p> Peyton shook her head , unwilling to accept praise she did n't deserve . She knew the truth-she could turn an assignment around quickly because outside the newspaper office she had no life . While other writers struggled to work amid the pressures of family schedules , children 's homework , school events , sporting activities , and the needs of a spouse , Peyton only had to take care of herself and her two cats . <p> At least that 's the way things were before King and Christine came into her life . The situation was a little different now , and she was feeling the pressure . <p> " I 'm not that fast , " she insisted . " And I 'm not that versatile . " <p> " Then do n't cave so quickly , MacGruder . Just because Nora 's your boss does n't mean you have to let her push you around . " <p> " I was ready to push back until she played the guilt card . When she mentioned the budget cuts , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I not agree to write whatever she wants ? " <p> " That 's what I like about you-you 're a solid team player . " <p> " I 'm a pushover . " <p> King smiled and stepped to the side of Peyton 's desk . " In that case , I 'd better prescribe two of these- " he held up the bottle of pain relievers- " or one of these . " Before Peyton could point out that they were surrounded by coworkers in cubicles , he bent and pressed a kiss to her lips . She closed her eyes , ready to forget about an audience of staff reporters , clerks , and copy editors , but the kiss did n't last . <p> She looked up at him , unsatisfied . <p> " Do any good ? " he asked . <p> " Not sure . Try again . Maybe increase the dosage . " <p> He bent , his lips warming hers with more passion this time . When he finally pulled away , Peyton exhaled a long sigh of happiness ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her cheeks warmed . " They approve . " <p> " I do n't give a fig about them . What did you think ? " <p> " Um ... better . " <p> " Only better ? Well , you know what they say about practice making perfect ... " <p> As the other reporters hooted and King leaned in for yet another kiss , Peyton pressed her palm against the center of his chest . " You know , it 's this kind of temptation that led to Marlo Evans 's maternity leave . And , in turn , to my impending headache . So maybe we should get back to work . " <p> With a roguish grin , King straightened and stepped away from her chair . " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " But after work- " Peyton squinted at him- " would you want to go for a jog with me and Christine ? We wanted to run the paths down by the shoreline . " <p> King shook his head . " Enticing offer , but I 've got to run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to talk to me about something . He says it 's important . " <p> Peyton nodded , once again reminded that their relationship was not as simple as it would have been if they 'd met in their twenties . She had Christine to consider , and King had David . Both children , hers and his , were nearly grown , and both had been forced to deal with the aftermath of their parents ' unwise decisions . <p> " MacGruder . " King 's voice , warm and insistent , drew her from her thoughts . " Maybe I 'll stop by your place later . " <p> " I 'd like that . " Peyton offered him a forgiving smile . " I 'll be waiting . " <p> King took two steps toward his office , then halted . " Hey- " he turned , propping his arms on the cubicle wall- " I found an interesting e-mail in my in-box this morning . A friend in New York said my name recently came up in a board meeting at the Times . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine . " The New York Times ? " <p> He chuckled . " Hard to imagine , huh ? Moving from the Middleborough Times to the Gray Lady ? " <p> " Your name came up in a board meeting ? What does that mean , exactly ? " <p> He shrugged . " I do n't know , but I 'll keep you posted . " <p> As he walked away , exchanging gibes with other writers as he passed their desks , Peyton felt fear blow down the back of her neck . Any other journalist would be salivating at the thought of writing for the Times , but King never seemed to get ahead of himself . Contentment was one of his primary virtues , and Peyton had n't realized how much she 'd been counting on his ability to remain satisfied with the status quo . <p> What would she do if she lost him ? <p> The thought struck like a blow to the chest , stealing her breath . Until recently , she had managed to keep herself detached from complicated personal relationships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about the brevity of life and the importance of connection . Now she was desperate to understand two precious people , but understanding took time , and time was something she no longer possessed in abundance . <p> She forced herself to take a deep breath and steady her pulse . No one was abandoning her ; the world had not shifted on its axis . Her imagination was simply working overtime , a tendency that nearly always resulted in needless worry and borrowed trouble . <p> With her gift for imagining disaster , maybe she should have been a novelist . <p> When she swiveled toward her computer , determined to set her fears aside and tackle her e-mail , her gaze fell again on the envelope from Eve Miller . The postmark was five days in the past , so by now the woman 's comments were old news . And in an electronic society , old news was dead news . <p> Peyton tossed the envelope into a bin filled with unopened letters and turned her attention to her in-box . <p> * * * <p> Peyton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse into the empty passenger seat , and fumbled with the buckle of her seat belt . When she was certain the car 's computer would n't scold her for forgetting some vital procedure , she turned the ignition switch and waited for the automatic seat to slide forward , tilt , rise , and whatever else it did to adjust to her frame . <p> King had talked her into buying this vehicle last weekend , insisting that her old car was only a few miles away from imploding . " Ninety-eight thousand miles ? " he exclaimed after glimpsing her odometer . " Good grief , MacGruder , are you going for some kind of endurance record ? " <p> She had to admit the new vehicle was nice , but its myriad bells and whistles bewildered her . She had n't taken the time to read the manual , and she barely managed to sit through the salesman 's demonstration . " I do n't have time to fuss with fancy gadgets , " she told the desperate young man who had greeted her and King at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and inexpensive . Something I wo n't have to give up chocolate to afford . " <p> Like a village matchmaker , the salesman grinned and fixed her up with this sleek blue machine , which he kept calling a crossover-a cross between a sedan and an SUV . She had a feeling the vehicle was too big to be economical or politically correct , but since an entire row of similar vehicles waited behind a fence at the dealership , the manager was probably eager to move his inventory . Regardless , the car earned good crash ratings , it used less gasoline than a tank , and it had the one accessory she could n't live without : a CD player . <p> Before putting the car in gear , Peyton punched the button of the stereo system and relaxed when the professional reader 's voice poured through the surround sound speakers . She 'd bought this audiobook about mothers and daughters shortly after telling Christine the truth about their relationship-yes , they were reporter and reader , but they were also biological mother and daughter . Eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of newspaper columns had brought them back together . <p> Now Peyton wanted nothing more than to be the mother she would have been if tragedy had n't intervened . A heaven-sent miracle had restored the child she 'd been forced to surrender for adoption , and Peyton did n't want to forfeit this second chance to love . And parent . And occasionally nag . <p> She and Christine were still in the midst of that awkward getting-to-know-you phase , but Peyton felt they 'd made great strides in their relationship . They tried to talk every day , even if only briefly , and though Christine still lived in the house she 'd inherited from her adoptive parents , she felt free enough to drop into Peyton 's home unannounced , as any daughter naturally would . <p> Still , Christine rarely called Peyton " Mom . " When necessary , she called Peyton by name ... or she did n't call her anything at all . <p> " By late adolescence , " a confident voice intoned as Peyton put the car in gear and backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed in one of three categories-distant , dissatisfied , or dependent . Do any of these words remind you of the young woman in your life ? " <p> Peyton shook her head and shifted into drive . The author needed a fourth category for Christine-maybe delightful . They were still in the honeymoon phase , each of them unbearably grateful to have found the other . They might have disagreements later-in fact , they probably would-but for now Peyton was thrilled to be able to know and love the young woman who had never been far from her thoughts and prayers . <p> " Outstanding mothers devote most of their time to their children , instilling healthy values into daughters who will become outstanding mothers themselves , " the reader continued , " but unsuitable mothers abandon and abuse . " <p> Peyton winced at the author 's use of the word abandon . <p> " Bottom line , if you provide your child with what she needs-clothing , shelter , food , affection-you , concerned mother , are off the hook if your daughter makes unwise decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter has the freedom to choose ... right or wrong . Do not blame yourself if she chooses to learn life 's lessons through negative experiences . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
