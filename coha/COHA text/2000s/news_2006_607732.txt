<p> Every Washington Redskins receiver has felt the sting of a football slapping his face at some point over the past few months . Inevitably , the receiver was just a step slow , a moment late coming out of his cut in a drill , and Todd Collins 's spot-on spiral was there to greet him with no time for his hands to be of any use . <p> Each occurrence was a reminder of the precision necessary to execute associate head coach Al Saunders 's offense , and the gap between Collins 's mastery of this complex offensive system and the receivers ' collective inexperience . <p> Timing is everything , with the ball quickly delivered from the quarterback  --  well before a receiver makes his move to the open field . To Collins , entering his seventh season in Saunders 's offense , the process is routine , with Saunders calling him the embodiment of the system . Everyone else is still trying to catch on  --  literally . <p> " He knows this offense , and you can tell with the way he releases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You turn your head and you have to really look for his ball , because it 's hitting you in the face half the time if you 're not ready . You 'll be reaching up with your hands up high and it 's already coming down . I have n't seen a day when he did n't get that ball out on time . So he 's the guy who 's going to be getting us right when it comes to timing . He 's a perfect fit for this offense . " <p> That , more than anything else , would explain why a quarterback who has not started a game since 1997 , with just 12 appearances and 18 completions in that span , was pursued by Washington this offseason . Collins , 34 , is an on-field extension of Saunders , and when the offensive whiz joined the organization in January , the longtime backup was not far behind . Saunders trusts Collins , and the veteran would appear to be the front-runner to back up Mark Brunell this season as second-year quarterback Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , learning yet another offense and absorbing Saunders 's 700-page playbook . <p> Even Brunell , at 35 and with 141 regular season starts on his rsum , has leaned on Collins these past few months , and players involved in all aspects of the offense say his presence has been a godsend . " I 'm so glad we have that guy here , " Campbell said . <p> " He 's like another coach on the field . " Saunders said : " Right now , probably the most significant person in Jason Campbell 's development is Todd Collins . " <p> But counting on a player who has thrown so few meaningful NFL passes in nearly a decade is undoubtedly a gamble , especially at a position as injury-prone as quarterback . Coach Joe Gibbs liked the film of Collins in past preseasons and his rare regular season work , but with so little recent game experience , expectations for Collins requires belief in Saunders 's appraisal . <p> " He 's brilliant , " Saunders said . " If you ask people who know Todd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to is his intelligence . And he 's a great technician in what he does . He 's very professional in the way he goes about his study and preparation , and his knowledge of this offense is as sound as it could possibly be . He has some tremendous skills . In a quarterback you always like to see a guy with physical skills , emotional skill and mental skills , and great courage , and he has all of those qualities . We 're just really happy that he 's here . " <p> For Collins , a quick-witted Revolutionary War buff , following Saunders was a no-brainer . The Redskins pursued him from the instant free agency began in March , and he signed a two-year , $2.5 million deal . Unlike in Kansas City , where starter Trent Green never missed a start during Collins 's last five years , Brunell has not played a full season since 2000 . Saunders believes that , had Collins started for the Chiefs , he would have excelled and that is the kind of support any second-stringer would relish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins said . " I do n't have to learn a new offense and I know what the coach expects of me . I pretty much know when I 'm doing something right or doing something wrong , but you definitely want to meet those expectations , not only for yourself but for him . " <p> Collins 's career has been a series of adjustments . He left Michigan with the best career and single-season completion percentages in team history , and the best average yards per play . Buffalo projected him as a rising star after selecting him in the second round in 1995 . Collins , a Boston native , finally won the starting job in 1997 , but completed just 55 percent of his passes with 13 interceptions and 12 touchdowns . The team won only five of his 13 starts and lost five of his last six . <p> He has not started since . Collins went to Kansas City in 1998 , but did not throw a pass in his first three seasons , and he has attempted as many as 12 passes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in Saunders he found a mentor , and over time made himself a prototype in the calculated footwork , speedy drop-backs , swift release and intricate timing necessary to thrive in this system . <p> Collins admits that he sometimes wonders if or when his next start will come , but accepts the life of the backup : Preparing to start despite getting few snaps in practice , and remaining mentally sharp despite such lapses between starts . <p> " It has n't happened for me in a number of years , " Collins said , " and , yeah , you start to wonder if it 'll happen for yourself , but the challenge is to stay focused during the season and the preseason and not slack off in your preparation . That 's what motivates me . I want to be prepared because I 've put in a lot of work up to this point to squander it now . " <p> In the meantime , Collins will go on being a font of information for his teammates . He already is known for striking up conversations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El learned that Collins is a lifelong renter after arriving in Kansas City uncertain of how long he would stay . Collins and Brunell compared notes about London and their shared interest in traveling abroad . ( Collins goes on regular fishing expeditions and took a six-week safari to Africa in 1998 . ) Campbell has gotten an education on wars and battles from long ago , including the history that took place on some of the islands around Boston Harbor . <p> " He 's always talking about stuff you do n't ever think about , " Campbell said . <p> Collins has become something of the class clown in quarterback meetings , as well , which is saying something given Brunell 's penchant for levity . ( " I try to keep it under wraps a little bit since I 'm still the new guy , " Collins said . ) Brunell and Collins met when they were in college , playing against each other at one point . Brunell was a history major , so they have plenty in common . <p> " He 's been a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was close to Patrick Ramsey , now playing for the New York Jets . " I can ask Al questions and I can ask quarterback coach Bill Lazor , but there 's another guy there who has actually done it and has been on the field time and time again in this offense . So I ask him as many questions as anybody else . <p> " I 've spent some time with him , and he 's a different cat . He 's got a great personality and we kind of go back and forth . We have some interesting conversations . "
