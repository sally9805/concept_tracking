That has motivated young people here , that we can do it make changes as well , " says Mr. Makgaba . <p> Why the big turnout ? <p> Around the country , voting was peaceful , and voter turnout was on track to be the highest since 1994 , when South Africans voted out the pro-apartheid National Party and ushered in majority rule under the ANC 's leader Nelson Mandela . <p> High turnout could favor the ANC , since the vast majority of South Africa 's population are poor and black , and while voters criticize the ANC for failing to deliver on its election promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their demands . <p> The higher turnout seems to be driven as much by public enthusiasm for ( or revulsion toward ) the ANC 's new populist leader , Jacob Zuma , as it is by a palpable desire for dramatic change , a sentiment expressed by all social and economic levels here . <p> " We are struggling here , we are hungry , we need a better life , " says Francinah Mohale , a jobless mother from Diepsloot , who says she has been searching for work for nearly three years . " Some people do n't have homes , they live in shacks . The drains are blocked . The streets are filthy . There is no work .

Fifteen years ago , when Mr. Mandela was sworn in as South Africa 's first black president , Diepsloot was an open field north of Johannesburg 's most northern suburbs . <p> But then the field filled with people setting up temporary shelters so they could be close to the jobs and prosperity that they expected would come in Johannesburg under an ANC government . <p> Now , with a population in the hundreds of thousands , Diepsloot is a dense slum of tin shacks , dirt roads , and ditches full of sewage , a place where poorly paid public school teachers , office clerks , and domestic servants live side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often by foot . <p> The frustration felt here in Diepsloot is palpable , a frustration of high expectations that the ANC would take better care of their black voting base . <p> " In my first election , in 1994 , I voted for the ANC , because I think they will do well , " says Olga Mahlangu , an unemployed mother with a 9-month-old daughter , Prudence , tied to her back . She says there is not enough housing available for people , and shortages of water and electricity in townships . " This time , I 'm voting for COPE . We tried ANC , but it was promises , promises , every day , and they did nothing . " <p> Suburban frustration with ANC <p> In middle-class areas , the frustration is , if anything , more powerful . White and black middle-class voters alike say that corruption in government agencies has lowered the standards of education , the quality of roads , and their ability to conduct business . <p> " The ANC got comfortable , and if you 're comfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Telao Lekalake , a civil engineer , living in the Johannesburg suburb of Bloubergsrand .

" <p> Velaphi Mpolweni , a banker , says that the excitement of this election comes from the fact that people sense that change is finally possible . <p> " For me , this election will strengthen our democracy , because now , there 's a choice , " says Mr. Mpolweni .

" People are a bit disillusioned and betrayed that the ANC has not delivered . " <p> Then Bulbulia stands on her toes as hundreds of people began singing and shouting " Viva Mandela ! " as the man affectionately known as Madiba slowly makes his way to the ballot box , smiling broadly and waving at the throngs of voters and photographers . <p> Mixed ANC support in a township <p> Far from the flashing strobe lights , about 10 miles from where Mandela voted , a group of about 200 people stand outside a white tent in the old township of Alexandra where Mandela had briefly lived before his 27-year incarceration by the apartheid regime . <p> The sprawling township is a study in contrast , islands of tiny shacks of corrugated iron surrounded with mile after mile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voting for the first time .
