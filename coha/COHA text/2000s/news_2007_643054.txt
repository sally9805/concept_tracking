<p> SINCE 1998 , NBC has been sending a " Today " host to far-flung locales like Angkor Wat , Easter Island and Machu Picchu , all for a feature on the show called " Where in the World Is Matt Lauer ? " This week , to help promote the next installment , Mr. Lauer is taking his most ambitious foray so far into cyberspace . <p> For the first time , NBC is devoting a special Web site , or a microsite , to the feature , and is selling all the advertising space to a single sponsor , Hyundai Motor America . The microsite ( followmatt.com ) , which went live on Monday , offers visitors a smorgasbord of contents , including humorous video clips , a recap of Mr. Lauer 's seven previous trips , and a contest centered on consumers creating material for the site . <p> The contents are accessible through items arrayed on a virtual desk , covered with what are meant to be Mr. Lauer 's possessions : his passport , iPod , camera , compass and car keys ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are neat touches , too . Click on a memo pad bearing the NBC peacock logo and the network 's familiar three-note chimes are heard . <p> The promotion , which Hyundai is paying an estimated $2.5 million to sponsor , is indicative of efforts by the television networks to more closely interweave traditional programming  --  and advertising  --  with the online media . <p> NBC in particular has been making much of its commitment to digital offerings , under the intent gaze of its parent , NBC Universal , part of the General Electric Company . <p> Recent initiatives include enabling computer users to watch prime-prime programs like " Heroes " and " The Office " on the network Web site , nbc.com ; a separate site ( nbbc.com ) , in partnership with the affiliated stations , devoted to syndicating video clips to independent Web sites ; a broadband channel , dotcomedy.com , devoted to light-hearted fare ; and a blog , " The Daily Nightly , " written by the anchor of the " NBC Nightly News , " Brian Williams ( dailynightly.msnbc.com ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second life through the Internet does not guarantee success . NBC itself was reminded of that yesterday , when programmers pulled from a prestigious Thursday night time slot a new sitcom , " Andy Barker , P.I. , " which had online previews before appearing on TV . <p> Still , in the competitive realm of television , especially in crowded parts of the broadcast day like the morning , the efforts to gain an advantage over rival networks go on . <p> " The ' Today ' show is not a TV show anymore ; it 's a brand , a brand that can play in all these new areas , " Jim Bell , the executive producer of " Today , " said in a telephone interview . <p> " The challenge is taking established franchises like ' Where in the World Is Matt Lauer ? ' and reinventing them for the Internet , where the growth is , " he said . " We 're trying to be everywhere , and we should be . " <p> The previous Internet presence for Mr. Lauer 's travel feature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost all of the campaigns to promote " Where in the World " had been devoted instead to the traditional media : ads in newspapers and magazines and commercials on radio stations and cable networks . <p> NBC News executives and their counterparts at the network 's internal marketing unit had long been considering ways to raise the online profile for the feature , which is scheduled to run on " Today " from April 30 to May 4 . <p> " Digital is something we 're all trying to figure out , how to make it work and how to make money on it , " said Frank Radice , senior vice president for advertising and promotion at the East Coast office of the marketing unit , known as the NBC Agency . <p> The goal for the microsite is " to build a viral buzz for marketing ' Where in the World , ' " Mr. Radice said . Achieving that , he said , would enable him to forgo " a traditional advertising campaign . " <p> To promote the microsite , the NBC Agency will buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt Lauer , " " travel " and the names of various countries . <p> Several agencies and digital design companies worked with the NBC Agency to produce the microsite , including the iChameleon Group , Neverstop and UCG . <p> Hyundai Motor America , part of the South Korean auto maker Hyundai Motor , worked on the sponsorship with its media agency , Carat , as well as its digital media agency , Carat Fusion , both part of the Aegis Group . <p> " This day part is something we 've been pursuing for a while , " said Joel Ewanick , vice president for marketing at Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley , Calif. , referring to the morning news shows , " but it 's hard to find something you can ' own . ' " <p> Joining with " Today " on the Internet makes sense , he added , because " last year over 80 percent of people who bought cars in America said they did some kind of research online . " <p> Hyundai Motor America was " an early entrant " into advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stayed where we were and frankly did n't use it to its full potential . " <p> Plans call for the percentage of the annual ad budget devoted to the Internet to increase to 10 percent for 2007 , he added , from around 2.5 percent last year and to reach the 20 percent level in 2008 . Hyundai spends about $600 million a year on advertising . <p> The sponsorship of " Where in the World " is for 2007 , Mr. Ewanick said , with " first right of refusal " for next year . <p> " The most important part of this is that we want to build brand equity , " he added . " We want that to grow over the years . " <p> The ad elements on followmatt.com include banner ads , a " sponsored by Hyundai " mention at the bottom of the home page and links to the company 's Web site ( hyundaiusa.com ) along with that logo on Mr. Lauer 's virtual ring of car keys . <p> The Hyundai models being promoted on the microsite include Veracruz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Coincidentally , as the Lauer promotion begins , Hyundai Motor America is wrapping up a review for the creative part of its account , which had been handled since 2002 by the Richards Group in Dallas . The company is hoping to select a new creative agency this week , Mr. Ewanick said. ##
