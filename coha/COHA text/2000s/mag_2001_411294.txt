Section : Companies People Ideas As Wal-Mart begins its largest expansion ever , it 's learning that merchandising has much in common with politics : Everything is local <p> To most folks , spam is the mystery meat inside a can or , more recently , unsolicited e-mail . But to executives at Wal-Mart , Spam is an inspired solution to a new challenge : getting customers to spend more money . <p> Looking to sell food to hunters who already frequented its sporting goods departments , the company asked Hormel Foods to come up with a snack that it could place alongside the rifles and fishing rods . Within weeks " Spamouflage "  --  Spam in camouflage cans  --  was blowing out the doors of 760 rural Wal-Marts . <p> " It 's a crazy idea , " smiles Thomas Coughlin , who as chief executive of the Wal-Mart Stores division oversees the operations of 2,700 domestic Wal-Marts . <p> Offbeat yes , but critical if Wal-Mart wants to retain its dominance of the U.S. retailing landscape . Despite its size and low prices Wal-Mart is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year ending Jan. 31 the chain 's earnings are projected to rise 7% to $6.7 billion , the slowest growth in four years , on a 12% increase in sales to $217 billion . Same-store sales for the year are projected to rise 5% , down from 8% two years ago . <p> But long before the latest dismal economic news Wal-Mart was grappling with an even greater problem : saturation . Now , in spite of the downturn , the company is gearing up for its largest expansion ever , with plans to grow by 46 million square feet next fiscal year , or a 9% increase over this year . <p> Wal-Mart has addressed part of the problem of an over-stored U.S. by expanding horizontally into groceries and the Internet and by acquiring wholesalers such as AmeriServe . But the company also has found a solution in its own parking lot : existing customers . By squeezing incremental revenue out of the same folks , Wal-Mart offsets the challenge of roping in more and more new customers . Already the average customer ticket at Wal-Mart is increasing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coughlin says . <p> A key component of the strategy is tailoring merchandise to local tastes , even if they 're a bit quirky . " Wal-Mart has got to have a regional merchandise strategy . If they do n't , they 'll become another Sears , " says Robert Voss , a former Wal-Mart senior vice president and the first general merchandise manager for Sam 's Club . <p> Though the tactic has been preached at Wal-Mart as far back as the days of Sam Walton , who coyly referred to the retailing colossus as a " small-town merchant , " its regional merchandising is being realized after years of patchy successes and plenty of misfires . <p> " We 've been so successful at generalizing , " says Coughlin . " But we 're not maximizing our opportunities . " For his part Coughlin nags employees to retrieve shopping carts from crowded Wal-Mart parking lots so customers can quickly refill them . He once padlocked the office of a store manager who was n't spending enough time with customers and employees . <p> Take a look at Sam Walton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the street Kmart is expanding into a superstore , while electronics retailer Best Buy has opened nearby . But at 9:45 a.m. on a recent Wednesday , Wal-Mart 's parking lot is bustling . Inside , store manager Michael Walker grabs a bottle of Crema Mexicana from a cooler and drawls , " I do n't know what this is . But it 's a huge seller . " <p> Crema Mexicana is a sweet , rich cream popular among Mexicans as a topping for traditional dishes . Walker may not know that , but he does know that 15% of his shoppers are Hispanic , which at his store translates into $16 million worth of sales annually . So , he 's stocking and selling 4,000 Bimbunelos sweet cakes a week , as well as Chayote squashes and Don Enrique corn husks . He 's localizing the store for the benefit of more affluent customers , too , such as the executives who toil at Wal-Mart 's nearby Bentonville headquarters , stocking $3,500 high-definition television sets and creating a bookstore with a coffee stand . <p> While Walker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week last year , he 's boosted the average spending by $3 a head , much of it by tailoring his selection to local sensibilities . <p> Until recently Walker 's success may have been the exception to the rule . Just four years ago Coughlin recalls pulling up to a downtown Philadelphia store surrounded by skyscrapers to see a fleet of 18hp riding lawnmowers out in front . Next to them were wood splitters . Inside , shelves were stocked with 30-lb. boxes of Tide , despite the fact that most shoppers traveled to the store by bus and could n't lug the big boxes home . <p> " I thought : ' What in the world are we doing ? ' " says Coughlin , a 23-year Wal-Mart veteran who began his retailing career as a store detective . Now it 's a different story . Coughlin bounds out of his office in the Bentonville headquarters into a room lined with specialized merchandise . He grimaces as he bites into a fishy-flavored Zapp 's Cajun Crawtator potato chip sold in Wal-Mart 's Louisiana stores , and motions toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stores in Louisiana sell $2,100 worth of the garish cake each week . What Wal-Mart ca n't buy or make , it invents . Coughlin holds up the ultimate fix-it gizmo : a can of WD-40 packaged with a roll of duct tape . " You ca n't find a guy who does n't need this stuff , " he beams . <p> To help further the cause , Wal-Mart two years ago expanded its vaunted data warehouse to 101 terabytes from 44 terabytes , enough to store and analyze two years of sales transactions . The warehouse provides access to 10 million retail transactions from the previous day , while also increasing the flow of information back to the chain 's 7,600 suppliers . The information allows Wal-Mart to concoct 300 custom assortments of products in the household chemical category , for instance . <p> Wal-Mart is notorious for playing hardball with its vendors , many of which set up offices near its headquarters in an area referred to as " Vendorville . " Its latest campaign to micromanage its merchandise demands even more out of the relationships . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers , " says James Postl , chief executive officer of Pennzoil-Quaker State . <p> Three years ago Pennzoil had 5 people devoted full time to Wal-Mart . Now it has 20 . Tapping into Wal-Mart 's sales data , Pennzoil has created 50 different display variations of its motor oil for the chain ( e.g. , more industrial oils for rural areas , auto oils for city dwellers ) , up from 5 two years ago . Postl resigns himself to the likelihood that the assortment will rise to 200 within a few years . <p> Pennzoil is a piker compared with Procter &; Gamble , which has a small army of 225 employees stationed near Wal-Mart 's headquarters . While some of the P &G; staffers manage products , others sift through Wal-Mart 's data to discern shopping trends . The company now knows , for instance , that liquid Tide sells better in the North and Northeast , Tide powder better in the South and Southwest . <p> But for all the fancy software , Wal-Mart still has its work cut out for it . In Bentonville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food Store advertises that it will match Wal-Mart 's prices and touts its in-store butcher and home-baked Martha Harp dinner rolls . <p> " Wal-Mart 's not as personal as they say they are , " sniffs Carolyn Kullman as she pushes her cart along the aisles of Harps . <p> Coughlin does n't disagree . " I 'm amazed by how much we do n't know , " he says . " We 're neophytes .
