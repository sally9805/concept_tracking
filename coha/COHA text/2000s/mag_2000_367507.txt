This is a big year for Giorgio Armani . It marks the 25th anniversary of his company and , on July 11 , his 65th birthday . And he has big plans . There 's the exhibition of his work opening at the Guggenheim museums in New York City in October and Bilbao , Spain , next March , then traveling to Tokyo , London and Venice . He is launching home and cosmetics lines , as well as shoes and handbags , unveiling an office in Milan with a theater for his fashion shows , and building a huge outlet , also in Milan , to house Emporio Armani , Armani Jeans and the first Armani Casa store  --  not to mention an Armani cafe and a Nobu sushi restaurant . All this atop stellar financial success : in 1998 the company racked up $850 million in sales and net income of $135 million , making it the most profitable fashion house in Italy . <P> But new realities have intervened . In February , Andrew Grossman , the man Armani hired 10 months earlier to oversee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Grossman 's middle-market thinking clashed with Armani 's . In March , Matthias Vriens , the creative director Armani hired last July , took a job at Gucci . And then in April , Armani 's managing director and key deputy , Giuseppe Brusone , made it known he would be leaving after 15 years with the company . Suddenly the question appeared to be , How will Giorgio get things done ? <P> Armani maintains that the company is on track for a glorious Y2K . Unlike competitors Gucci and Prada , Armani has been spending his cash  --  some $650 million in 1999  --  not on acquisitions but on tightening his control over the way his products are made , displayed and sold . Last month he bought two of the Italian factories that produce his signature White Label collection from conglomerate GFT , and he recently established an office in Singapore to run his Asian business . He has also bought back the franchise for his stores in Japan . The new accessories collection should be very lucrative , the company says . The shoes and handbags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , Armani is facing stiff competition on its home turf  --  men 's suits  --  from the likes of Ermenegildo Zegna . And 19 years after its introduction , the younger and cheaper Emporio Armani collection is struggling to define its identity with the notoriously fickle 25- to 35-year-old market . That was one reason Armani hired Grossman , his first U.S. chief in five years . <P> For the time being , Armani is running things himself , but he still needs to find replacements for Brusone and Grossman , and some see that as a good opportunity . Says luxury-goods consultant Armando Branchini : " Giorgio Armani products have great potential , but they need new ideas and new management  --  a new approach to the market . " Armani himself agrees . Sort of . " Armani does not have the big brand problems of Nike and Coke , " says corporate spokesman Robert Triefus . " Mr. Armani does n't feel the brand needs to be reborn . But it 's going through an evolution . Absolutely . " <P> And 2000 is just the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
