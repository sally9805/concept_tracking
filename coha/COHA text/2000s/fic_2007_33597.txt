After Saturday night at the In-N-Out and a steady parade of drunken rockers , skater kids , Chicano families , frat boys , Beverly Hills princesses , East L.A. gangbangers , Hollywood hippies , artists , and stoners walked through the swinging glass doors , a microcosm of Los Angeles itself . Nick Huntington sat alone in the front booth , listlessly watching the local citizenry and unconsciously eavesdropping on two hyperactive film types  --  boneheads , in his humble opinion  --  honing a movie pitch at the next table , dreams of Hollywood the backbone of every conversation within a ten-mile radius of the studios . He was holding a fry in midair when he spotted the boy . Nick froze , and the fry dangled on his mouth , the ketchup dripping from the tip and burning the edge of his tongue . The boy was shaking visibly , his entire body vibrating from an uncontrollable compulsion  --  knees knocking against each other , teeth chattering , head twitching from side to side . His long hair was matted against his forehead and the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After midnight at the In-N-Out Burger on the corner of Orange Drive and Sunset Boulevard and no one paid much attention as he shuffled up to the front of the line , dirt-black fingers trembling asthey dug into his pants pockets for grimy dollar bills and change . " The number one , " he mumbled , so softly that the cashier had to repeat it . A flat chemical scent emanated from his pores as if he were sweating aluminum . " Number one ? " she asked again helpfully , breathing through her mouth so she would n't smell him but trying not to show it  --  they got all kinds there . The boy nodded . His hair was so dirty it looked brown , except for the roots , which were startlingly , shockingly silver , like a halo . He was so skinny his wrist bones protruded from his skin , poking out painfully . His skin was sallow , a drained , sickly , yellow color  --  junkie yellow  --  but otherwise it was clear , free of the acne scars and hollowed craters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three-day-old stubble , then picked at a cuticle on his thumb , watching as the cashier punched in his order . He accepted his food and turned to look for a seat . His eyes met Nick 's , and a chill went down Nick 's spine . It was like looking into the eyes of a ghost . Nick became conscious that his jaw was hanging open and made a deliberate effort to close it . He never did eat that french fry . He 'd lost his appetite . " Are n't you Johnny Silver ? " he finally asked . Nick could n't believe it . Johnny Silver was supposed to be onstage at the Hollywood Bowl at that very moment , in a comeback concert that was already being heralded as the most important music event of the year  --  if not the decade , if not the century . Yet there he was , standing right in front of him . Johnny Silver , his violet eyes boring into Nick 's skull , that otherworldly masculine beauty  --  like David Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but alive . The famous Johnny Silver , the boy who would rock the world , standing underneath the fluorescent lights of a fast-food restaurant , looking as if the universe had just run him over . For the longest time Johnny simply stood there . His eyes glazed , then focused . Tears sprung to his eyes , and they coursed silently down his cheeks , a river of white against the grime . Nick stood up and approached him cautiously , as a lion tamer would approach his lion . " Johnny , man , what the hell happened to you ? " " I ... I do n't know , " Johnny replied , and the shaking intensified . He looked around the fast-food restaurant as if he had no idea how he 'd gotten there . " I do n't remember anything , except that moment when I came out and strummed my guitar , and I looked out at the audience , at the lights ... so many people  --  they 'd all come to see me  --  roaring my name . I blinked , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band , the stage , the hotels , Sunset Strip , palm trees , cars , everything disappeared . And I woke up , alone in the desert , as if none of this "  --  he waved his hand to indicate the whole place and everything beyond it  --  " had ever existed .
