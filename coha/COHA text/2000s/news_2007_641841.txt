<p> The dizzying pace of the digital revolution often leaves us yearning for simplicity , but it 's probably safe to say there are two kinds of people in this world : those who have disappeared into the time-sucking maelstrom of social networking websites , and loners . <p> That might have sounded like an overstatement a few years ago , when MySpace and Facebook were just beginning to wobble toward cultural relevance , but the reality in 2007 is much different . <p> Social networking sites are our new watercoolers , photo albums and bulletin boards . By mimicking , then deconstructing , the tangled web of relationships in the real world , they have proved themselves useful in ways scarcely imagined a half-decade ago . <p> And they 're not just for dating or gossip . A surprising amount and diversity of people - representing nearly every age and interest - use the sites , and accidental entrepreneurs are taking the MySpace model in bold new directions . <p> That site 's success practically begs for it . News Corp. - owned MySpace , which boasts more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in ad revenue this year . Not bad for a site founded in 2003 and modeled after social networking pioneer <p> Friendster - which it now dwarfs . <p> " It 's useful for everybody , but I think it 's more useful for a younger crowd , " said Mariko Jenkins , 30 , a MySpace member for four years . " They use it more because they know how to work the technology . " <p> Jenkins , an assistant buyer at Sports Authority in Englewood , said she could see her mother using MySpace , but that " it would probably take her an hour " just to log on . <p> For the uninitiated , social networking sites might seem the province of short-attention-span kids or the painfully lame . Why collect and monitor your friends virtually when you can do it for real ? <p> But it 's impossible to ignore the rise of user-generated content , and the way it 's changed our consumption of popular culture . YouTube and Wikipedia ? They 're old hat compared with sites like Virb.com , a <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad clutter and clunky interface , MySpace also remains a powerful promotional tool for established or unknown musicians . Users can share video clips , songs and photos of their favorite artists - or themselves . <p> " On Friendster , if you were a band and you made a profile , they would delete it , " <p> MySpace co-founder Tom Anderson told Forbes.com last year . " If you made a profile for your company or for where you lived or a neighborhood or an idea , you 'd get deleted . ... We did n't stop people from promoting whatever they wanted to promote on MySpace . " <p> Thanks to MySpace and <p> Facebook , dozens of other social networking sites are exploding in popularity and number . From aging baby boomers to 8-year-olds , the social networking model is hot . <p> " People like being in a community , " said Carol Rooney , partner program manager for Imbee.com . " Kids want to be able to communicate with other kids who have their same interest . " <p> When Rooney says " kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site for children ages 8-14 . Entrepreneurial mom Jeanette Symons launched it two years ago when her 7-year-old son asked to set up his own MySpace page . Fearing Internet predators and other complications , she installed a server in her closet to host his closed-circuit blogs . <p> " That idea germinated and really sparked a bigger idea for her , " Rooney said . <p> Imbee , based in Oakland , has grown mostly from word of mouth . It now boasts 50,000 users and has made its way into schools as a writing and teaching tool . The secure , free site is closed to search-engine crawlers and lets parents monitor kids ' online activities , producing a daily report of their visits . <p> 55-Alive.com is geared to the other end of the spectrum . The site 's producers hope to draw aging baby boomers and retirees with MySpace-style profiles , forums , targeted advertising and even a Battle of the Bands competition . <p> " We 're not a big company like some of the others in terms of having tens of millions of dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , " CEO Jeff Lantz said . " We 've got functionality at or beyond all our competitors , including e-mail accounts , Web communities , blogging and a dating site . " <p> The 2-year-old company , based in Lake St. Louis , Mo. , has about 3,500 members and just released a downloadable widget that delivers personalized weather and news to users ' desktops . <p> Keeping it relevant <p> Capitalizing on users and their consumer behavior helps makes these sites profitable . Houston-based Yippykya <p> . com , a networking site aimed at actors , artists , designers and musicians , touts its " commerce-enabled " interface , which allows users to sell products from 1,100 merchants that have signed up with the site , from CDs and DVDs to sports memorabilia . <p> " It 's a community that has n't been there before , " CEO John Reger said of his 80,000-member site . " In the next five to 10 years , you 're going to see a network of people doing everything based on their community , like your high school , university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Even politicians have slowly awakened to the potential of these sites , creating profiles and interacting with potential voters . Of course , seeing Mitt Romney 's mug in MySpace 's " Cool New People " box is a stretch , but that 's the challenge every site faces - growing without losing its appeal . <p> Mark Zuckerberg , who created Facebook at the ripe old age of 19 , recently told Newsweek that maintaining his site 's relevancy is one of his primary goals . But Zuckerberg does n't like to call it " social networking . " <p> " The social graph is this thing that exists in the world , it always has , and it always will , " the Harvard dropout , now 23 , told Newsweek . " What ( Facebook ) needed to do was construct as accurate a model possible of the way the social graph looks in the world . So once Facebook knows who you care about , you can upload a photo album , and we can send it to all those people automatically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million users , an impressive number considering it opened to the general public only last year ( previously it was for college students only ) . <p> As with any addictive activity , people can be obsessive about their social networking sites . In Australia , a recent study by Internet security firm SurfControl found that Facebook could be costing companies there billions of dollars . <p> Australia boasts nearly a quarter million Facebook users , and workers immersed in it may be responsible for up to $4 billion in productivity losses there . <p> But the doubters ' question remains : Are we just building a thin simulacrum of ourselves over the Internet ? <p> Mariko Jenkins , who admittedly checks her MySpace profile only every couple of weeks , does n't think so . <p> " It 's not like a huge networking thing for me ; it 's just for friends to get in touch that I have n't seen for a long time , or that live out of state , " she said . " It 's good because people go on for music and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband travels a lot . It 's good for him to stay in contact with people when he 's out on the road . " <p> Now that 's utility .
