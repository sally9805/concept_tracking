Seven years ago , I had my first tutorial in becoming a man . // The idea for this book came to me then , when I went out for the first time in drag . I was living in the East Village at the time , undergoing a significantly delayed adolescence , drinking and drugging a little too much , and indulging in all the sidewalk freak show opportunities that New York City has to offer . // Back then I was hanging around a lot with a drag king whom I had met through friends . She used to like to dress up and have me take pictures of her in costume . One night she dared me to dress up with her and go out on the town . I 'd always wanted to try passing as a man in public , just to see if I could do it , so I agreed enthusiastically . // She had developed her own technique for creating a beard whereby you cut half inch chunks of hair from unobtrusive parts of your own head , cut them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them onto your face with spirit gum . Using a small round freestanding mirror on her desk , she showed me how to do it in the dim , greenish light of her cramped studio apartment . It was n't at all precise and it would n't have passed muster in the daylight , but it was good enough for the stage , and it would work well enough for our purposes in dark bars at night . I made myself a goatee and mustache , and a pair of baroque sideburns . I put on a baseball cap , loose-fitting jeans and a flannel shirt . In the full-length mirror I looked like a frat boy-sort of . // She did her thing-which was more willowy and soft , more like a young hippie guy who could n't really grow much of a beard-and we went out like that for a few hours . // We passed , as far as I could tell , but I was too afraid to really interact with anyone , except to give one guy brief directions on the street . He thanked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we just walked the streets of the Village scanning people 's faces to see if anyone took a second or third look . But no one did . And that , oddly enough , was the thing that struck me the most about that evening . It was the only thing of real note that happened . But it was significant . // I had lived in that neighborhood for years , walking its streets where men lurk outside of bodegas , on stoops and in doorways much of the day . As a woman , you could n't walk down those streets invisibly . You were an object of desire or at least semiprurient interest to the men who waited there , even if you were n't pretty-that , or you were just another piece of pussy to be put in its place . Either way , their eyes followed you all the way up and down the street , never wavering , asserting their dominance as a matter of course . If you were female and you lived there , you got used to being stared down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could do about it . // But that night in drag , we walked by those same stoops and doorways and bodegas . We walked right by those same groups of men . Only this time they did n't stare . On the contrary , when they met my eyes they looked away immediately and concertedly and never looked back . It was astounding , the difference , the respect they showed me by not looking at me , by purposely not staring . // That was it . That was what had annoyed me so much about meeting their gaze as a woman , not the desire , if that was ever there , but the disrespect , the entitlement . It was rude , and it was meant to be rude , and seeing those guys looking away deferentially when they thought I was male , I could validate in retrospect the true hostility of their former stares . // But that was n't quite all there was to it . There was something more than plain respect being communicated in their averted gaze , something subtler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show disrespect . For them , to look away was to decline a challenge , to adhere to a code of behavior that kept the peace among human males in certain spheres just as surely as it kept the peace and the pecking order among male animals . To look another male in the eye and hold his gaze is to invite conflict , either that or a homosexual encounter . To look away is to accept the status quo , to leave each man to his tiny sphere of influence , the small buffer of pride and poise that surrounds and keeps him . // I surmised all of this the night it happened , but in the weeks and months that followed I asked most of the men I knew whether I was right , and they agreed , adding usually that it was n't something they thought about anymore , if they ever had . It was just something you learned or absorbed as a boy , and by the time you were a man , you did it without thinking . // After the whole incident had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short time in drag I had learned such an important secret about the way males and females communicate with each other , and about the unspoken codes of male experience , then could n't I potentially observe much more about the social differences between the sexes if I passed as a man for a much longer period of time ? It seemed true , but I was n't intrepid enough yet to do something that extreme . Besides it seemed impossible , both psychologically and practically , to pull it off . So I filed the information away in my mind for a few more years and got on with other things . // Then , in the winter of 2003 , while watching a reality television show on the A&amp; E network , the idea came back to me . In the show , two male and two female contestants set out to transform themselves into the opposite sex-not with hormones or surgeries , but purely by costume and design . The women cut their hair . The men had theirs extended . Both took voice and movement lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sex they were trying to become . All chose new wardrobes , personas and names for their alter egos . The bulk of the program focused on the outward transformations , though the point at the end was to see who could pass in the real world most effectively . Neither of the men really passed , and only one of the women stayed the course . She did manage to pass fairly well , though only for a short time and in carefully controlled circumstances . // But , as in most reality television programs , especially the American ones , nobody involved was particularly introspective about the effect their experiences had had on them or the people around them . It was clear that the producers did n't have much interest in the deeper sociologic implications of passing as the opposite sex . It was all just another version of an extreme make-over . Once the stunt was accomplished-or not-the show was over . // But for me , watching the show brought my former experience in drag to the forefront of my mind again and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible with the right help . I knew that writing a book about passing in the world as a man would give me the chance to explore some of the unexplored territory that the show had left out , and that I had barely broached in my brief foray in drag years before . // I was determined to give the idea a try . // ( Continues ... ) //
