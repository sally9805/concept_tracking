It 's never smart for a parent embroiled in a child-custody dispute to fantasize publicly about mass murder . It 's especially unwise if you 're Juan Miguel Gonzalez , father of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez , and your custody battle has become an international human-interest story and cold war political struggle . But longing and frustration had clearly taken a toll last week when Juan Miguel , 31 , let loose a harangue from Cuba in an interview with ABC 's Nightline . While angrily demanding the return of Elian , who has been living in Miami with relatives since fishermen rescued him from the Atlantic on Thanksgiving Day , the boy 's father suggested that his U.S. kin were " unfeeling " accomplices to " child abuse . " Then he mused that he might like to come to Miami " with a rifle and do away with " the Cuban exiles there who are fighting to keep Elian in the U.S.  --  or at least " break the necks of all those s.o.b.s . " <P> In Miami , Juan Miguel 's uncle Lazaro Gonzalez said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood too , and it 's my sacred duty to see that he is n't sent back to that wolf Fidel Castro in a country where children do n't even have enough milk to drink . " He added that Juan Miguel , a Communist Party member in Cuba , should " have the pants to admit that his son will be better off here . " Lazaro insisted that Juan Miguel come to the U.S. if he wants to claim Elian  --  whose mother Elizabet , 29 , drowned after the capsizing of the small boat in which she , Elian and 12 others had escaped Cuba . Elian was left to float on an inner tube for two days . Says Lazaro , an auto mechanic and former Cuban gymnast who brought his family to Miami in 1984 : " Elian is virtually an orphan . " <P> Until last week , most Americans had defined the Elian Gonzalez dispute as the shameful use of a child by both Castro and his single-minded enemies in Miami 's exile community . But , as events have shown , Elian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feud that can be just as ugly as the political kind  --  and just as damaging to a small boy . <P> Elian 's grandmothers , however , have offered hope of a solution . Castro , who has apparently refused to let Juan Miguel travel to Miami and bring his son back , finds Elian 's " kidnapping " a useful tool for whipping up anti-Yankee fervor , including a demonstration of 100,000 Cuban mothers in Havana last Friday . Afterward , the grandmothers told TIME they are willing to make the trip  --  and they seemed to have Castro 's blessing . " I am not afraid of Miami , " said Mariela Quintana , the paternal grandmother . " I will pick Elian up myself . " The other , Raquel Rodriguez , blasted the oft-repeated assertion by Lazaro 's family that keeping the boy in the U.S. was the dying wish of Elizabet ( who was divorced from Juan Miguel ) . " How dare they speak for her , " she said . " Elisa did not know those people in Miami . For her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , the one he has always known . "
