Too Old to Rock ' n ' Roll Too Young to Die ( performed by Jethro Tull ) <p> Joe Nance had blood on his hands . <p> He had n't realized it until he threw his guitar pick into the crowd and waved good-bye . Two streams of liquid crimson trickled down his palms and over his wrist . It meant he must have played a good show . <p> Nance turned to his bandmates and nodded . <p> Let 's get the hell out of here ! <p> The crowd of two hundred or so fans shouted for a second encore but Nance was n't having it . He was sixty years old , tired , and hungry . The rest of the members of Windy City Engine were roughly the same age and just as weary and famished . The gig was done . Time to chill out . <p> Nance led the other three guys off the stage and through the door to the dressing rooms . Martyrs ' was a small club on the North Side of Chicago , not far from Wrigley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner was friendly to classic Chicagoprog bands like the Engine and North Side . <p> As lead guitarist and vocalist , Nance had led Windy City Engine since 1970 . For a band that had been around so many years , it was important to maintain a solid , professional live show to give them longevity . In fact , most of their current income came from constant gigging . They made very little money from CD sales . Except for a few of the classic albums from the seventies , the rest of the band 's catalog was rare and out of print . Their last studio album of original material was already ten years old . It , too , was out of print . Nance and the rest of the band had to face it-they were a nostalgia outfit and they just barely made a living at it . <p> Charles Nance , the band 's drummer and Joe 's brother , noticed the blood as they slogged into the green room . <p> " You all right ? " <p> Nance nodded . " ' Course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin slices in the skin . " Damn it . This is gon na hurt like hell tomorrow night . " <p> " We could rearrange the set so you just play keyboards . " <p> " Are you kidding ? The fans 'd freak out . " <p> It was true . Although Nance occasionally played keys , people went to see Windy City Engine expecting him with a guitar around his shoulder . <p> " Yeah , " Charles said , " I guess you 're right . It 'd be like going to see Santana and watching Carlos shake maracas for the whole show . " <p> Manny Rodriguez , the bass player , and Harrison Brill , the rhythm guitarist , collapsed into easy chairs . They already had cold beers in their hands . <p> " I 'm gettin ' too old for this shit , " Brill muttered . <p> Charles laughed . " Come on , Harrison , you 're never too old to rock ' n ' roll . " <p> " Yeah ? I 'm sure old enough to die . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " My back was hurtin ' again tonight , too , " Rodriguez added . <p> Charles rolled his eyes . " You guys . What 's wrong with you ? Do n't be such old men ! Come on , that was a great gig we just played . The audience loved it . " <p> " What audience there was , " Joe said . " That was the smallest crowd we 've had in a long time . " <p> " Well , it 's raining . Kept people away . " <p> " Did n't keep ' em from going to see the Cubs . " <p> Charles shook his head . " Well , boo hoo . You guys are pathetic . You should be happy we 're still playing at all . I 'm going home . I 'll see you in Milwaukee tomorrow . " <p> The drummer grabbed his gig bag , saluted the other guys , and left the room . <p> " How come he 's always so cheerful ? " Rodriguez asked . <p> Joe Nance cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't know , but it 's always made me want to puke . When we were growing up he drove me nuts . My little brother never got mad , never got upset , and never was in a bad mood . Sometimes I just wanted to kick his ass . " <p> Nance went into the bathroom and ran cold water over his bleeding fingers . He washed them with soap , wrapped them in a paper towel , and then took a leak . When he was done , he went back into the green room , where Ray , the club 's owner , was waiting . He had a stack of cash in his hand-a very small stack . <p> " Here 's your take of the door , Joe . " <p> " Thanks , Ray . " <p> " Not many people tonight . " <p> " I guess not . " <p> " Probably the rain . " <p> " That 's what we figured . Where 's the first aid kit ? " <p> Ray nodded toward the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He left the room as Nance stuck the wad into his bag . Making payroll was going to be tougher this month . <p> " How many roadies we got now ? " Nance asked as he retrieved some Band-Aids . <p> " Three , " Rodriguez answered . " You know that . " <p> " We might have to let one go . " He managed to apply two bandages to his fingers and then said , " I 'll see you tomorrow night in Wisconsin . " <p> " Bye , Joe , " the other two spoke in unison . <p> When the band 's leader was gone , Rodriguez and Brill looked at each other and sighed . <p> " You get the feeling Joe 's gon na cut loose pretty soon ? " Brill asked . <p> " Yeah . But I 've been feeling that for ten years . " <p> " What 'll you do if he does ? We both know there 's no Windy City Engine without Joe . " <p> " I know . I guess we 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , play sessions , you know . I wish Zach needed a bass player . I 'd probably leave the Engine myself . " <p> " Zach Garriott does n't need you , partner . Trust me . " <p> " Screw you , too ! " Brill finished his beer . " How come Zach Garriott 's the only musician in the Chicagoprog scene who made it big ? " <p> Rodriguez shrugged . " I do n't know . Because he 's good ? " <p> Brill grunted and stood . " Well , I 'm out of here . I thought it was a good show . See you tomorrow night . " <p> " Yeah , I 'm leaving , too . Bye , Harrison . " <p> The two worn-out musicians gathered their stuff and shuffled out of the club without saying another word to each other . <p> They could n't know that the demise of Windy City Engine was closer than they imagined . <p> Charles Nance drove his ' 03 Toyota Highlander south on Damen to North Avenue , took the right turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in a prewar town house that was desperately in need of repairs and fixing up , but since he was a divorced man of fifty-eight with a limited income from music , he did n't care much about appearances . He was simply happy that he still made a living in the band with which he 'd been playing since he was a teenager . It was all he ever cared about and he was sure that his brother , Joe , felt the same way . He knew Joe got tired of never making good money , but in Charles 's opinion , Windy City Engine was doing very well for a band that had been around for four decades . They were gigging and he was playing drums for a living ! That was all that mattered to Charles Nance . Just put him behind a drum kit-anywhere , anytime-and he had a smile on his face . He knew , though , that many of his contemporaries were ready to throw in the towel . Not him . As far as he was concerned , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up , strike , load , and carry the equipment from gig to gig without the band having to do it themselves , then they were doing all right . <p> Nance slid the SUV into his driveway and parked in front of the separate garage . He 'd lived in the pocket east of Humboldt Park and west of the Kennedy Expressway since the early eighties and it suited him just fine . It was quiet , the neighbors were friendly , and he was n't far from his brother . Charles was a man of few complaints . <p> He got out of the vehicle and took a deep breath . The rain had ceased , so the late April night air was pleasantly cool and moist . It was the time of year he enjoyed the most . Seeing that Chicago realistically had at the most only a month or two of spring and fall , three months of hot summer , and nearly six months of winter , residents had to relish what good weather they could get . Charles had a good mind to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a beer , and listen to the crickets before turning in . <p> But as he stepped toward the front porch , he noticed that the side gate to his fenced backyard was ajar . <p> That 's odd , he thought . He had n't remembered going through the gate anytime recently . <p> He took a few steps toward the gate and peered into the darkness behind the house . He was n't worried about burglars because he had an airtight security system in his home . Nevertheless , it was possible for someone to enter the backyard through the unlocked gate if they wanted . <p> " Someone there ? " he called . <p> Silence . <p> He shrugged , pulled the squeaky gate closed , and turned toward the front porch once again . Charles bounded up the wooden steps , removed the keys from his trouser pocket , and stood at the door to unlock it . <p> The side gate squeaked again . <p> What the ... ? <p> Charles looked beyond the wooden rail that lined the porch and saw that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who it was , but the dim moonlight revealed the intruder to be a woman wearing a floppy hat . She had shoulder-length blonde hair and she wore a trench coat-the kind private detectives from the old film noir flicks favored . <p> " Who are you ? " Charles asked . " What are you doing in my backyard ? " <p> The figure remained still and silent . <p> Charles took a step toward her , the rail of the porch between them . " I asked you a question , miss . " <p> The woman raised her right arm and there was no mistaking the glint of black metal in her hand . <p> " Hello , Charles , " the woman said . " Remember me ? " <p> She had a low , throaty voice . One that he recognized . Charles 's eyes went wide and he gasped . <p> The blonde hair ... the floppy hat ... ! <p> The handgun recoiled twice . The shots were not as loud as one might expect . They were more like two firecrackers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July . <p> Charles felt his chest explode with a fiery pain that he did n't think was possible for a human being to experience . As he stumbled backward , he managed to blurt out a name . <p> " Sylvia ... ! " <p> And then he crashed onto the porch . <p> Whether Charles Nance was too old to rock ' n ' roll might have been debatable , but he certainly was n't too young to die . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
