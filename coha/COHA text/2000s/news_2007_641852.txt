<p> Judging the plan to close and reinvent schools across Denver comes down to a simple question : Will the estimated 2,355 students displaced by this decision be better off ? <p> The answer looms large for Denver Public Schools Superintendent Michael Bennet and the seven members of the school board . <p> " Will it be a defining moment ? Is what they 're going to do be significant ? " said Steve Kaplan , a Denver lawyer and member of the independent committee that created criteria for school closures . " It 's a terrific opportunity for DPS , and I 'm hoping it 's a terrific opportunity for the kids in DPS . " <p> Bennet told members of the facilities and finances committee Monday that $2 million of the $3.5 million saved from building consolidations will follow the students to their new schools . <p> Those schools will get more resources - maybe even more teachers and smaller class sizes - to handle the influx . <p> But what remains unknown is whether spending more money at struggling schools , or moving students around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Culture of success critical <p> In northeast Park Hill , officials are recommending closing Hallett Elementary , which has seen a jump in third-grade reading scores since 2004 . <p> Those students will have options to go to Smith or Stedman elementary schools , both low-performing . Smith has been ranked " unsatisfactory " five times in the past six years . <p> At Hallett , the number of third-graders proficient in reading moved up from 18 percent in 2004 to 35 percent in 2007 . At Stedman , those third- grade reading scores have gone down from 41 percent four years ago to 27 percent last school year . <p> Van Schoales , a program officer at the Piton Foundation who has studied school closures nationally , said school consolidation can work , but creating a culture of success in the new schools is critical . <p> " It will be critical that there be attention to enhancing the program for all kids , " he said . " Size does matter . It 's easier to have a more personalized environment in a smaller school . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things differently . " <p> Near Five Points , Bennet is recommending the closure of Wyman and Mitchell elementaries - both ranked " unsatisfactory " and both with declining enrollment overall . <p> They 're shifting those students to Gilpin Elementary and to the Cole Middle School building , which was closed by the state in 2005 and converted to a charter school that has since pulled out of the neighborhood . <p> " The worst thing we could do is close down a school and do harm , " said former Denver Mayor Federico Pea , who co-chairs the A+ Citizens Committee . " The first priority is first do no harm , and the second is to provide a better educational opportunity . " <p> DPS officials hope to create new programs in existing buildings too . <p> Horace Mann , a northwest Denver middle school with dwindling enrollment , for example , will become a school for preschoolers through eighth-graders . Kunsmiller Middle School will take on an arts focus and serve students in grades six through 12 . And Place Middle School will <p> morph into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . <p> Better environments <p> In almost six months of meetings , Bennet heard adamantly from the panel of people who created the criteria for school closures that they would n't support a proposal that sent students to worse schools . <p> " It became the main conversation because it needed to , " said Ricardo Martinez , co-director of Padres Unidos , a parent advocacy group . <p> Kaplan agreed . " It was a message to DPS that there needs to be a comprehensive sense about how the district is going to think about better education and that these school closures had to fit into a broader plan for improving education , " he said . <p> As a result , Bennet and his staff are recommending fewer schools close than had originally been talked about . If Bennet closed 20 to 30 schools , he could n't guarantee better placement for all of those displaced students , he said . <p> Bennet told committee members Monday he is " absolutely convinced " that the district can honor the promise of putting students in better environments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert , said he 's seen tension in schools taking in students from shuttered buildings in Chicago , where he 's based . <p> " How does this school closing help the kids ? " he said . " Maybe wherever they 're being moved will have the best teachers in the city , new buildings loaded with technology , that the kids are going to have the best books and resources , the things we know that kids need to be successful . . If not , what 's the point ? " <p> Schoales , whose Piton Foundation funded the school closures committee , said it 's probably too early to tell whether the plan will work . <p> " You do n't know from one presentation on whether they have a really good plan , " he said . " I do n't know . if a smaller number of schools will support kids in dramatically better learning environments . Knowing that is going to take time .

The school board promised to add a Montessori program . Gilpin Elementary also is underenrolled by 250 students and has ample room . <p> What it would become : Gilpin Community Montessori P-8 . <p> Gilpin 's existing program would phase out , and a new Gilpin Community Montessori program would grow from infants through 5-year-olds in 2008 to a fully developed P-8 program by 2011 . Enrollment priority would be for the Gilpin area and then expanded near northeast Denver . <p> HORACE MANN MIDDLE <p> Reasons for change : Horace Mann Middle School has had low and declining academic scores with only 20 percent of students proficient in writing and reading and 10 percent proficient in math .

Enrollment has dropped 340 students from 2000 to 2006 . Half of the building 's 1,413 seats are occupied . Students in the area choose to attend schools other than Kunsmiller . <p> What it would become : <p> Kunsmiller Arts Academy . <p> The school would be home to an arts magnet program for sixth- through 12th-graders , allowing students to pursue a specific arts discipline while exploring other arts and academic interests . Students would be selected by interview , not audition . <p> Students currently enrolled in the school would continue until they complete the eighth grade .
