<p> Growing up , Stacy Peterson was on the move . <p> But no matter where her family went , trouble followed . <p> There was an absent mother . Alcoholism . Domestic violence . Troubled finances . Two sisters who died young . A brother in prison .

" It was tough . " <p> Out of this chaos emerged Stacy , quiet , maternal , organized , crafty , pretty , a good student who graduated early from Romeoville High School , a young woman forced to grow up too soon . <p> HUSBAND NAMED AS SUSPECT <p> She was 17 when she met Drew Peterson , a 47-year-old Bolingbrook cop who seemed to have everything missing from her family life : money , authority , stability and a nice house in the suburbs . <p> Stacy would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kathleen Savio , and their two young sons .

But Stacy may have just been looking for a way out . <p> Drew Peterson has said he thinks she left him for another man , but her family and friends continue searching , insisting she would never leave that way . They fear the 23-year-old nursing student and mother is dead . <p> " People that are good , good things are supposed to happen to them , " said Dawna Klitzke , whom Stacy lived with in Fort Myers , Fla. , for part of Stacy 's junior high school years .

Linda Cales said Christie was in and out of the family 's life . <p> Linda Cales said she met Stacy 's father in 1994 at the Lani Kai , a tiki bar in Fort Myers , Fla . She had just ended a stint of seasonal work . He was scoping out a marina to buy . <p> " We danced , " she said .

He offered her the job and a ride to Illinois . She took both . " The kids came home from school and it was like ' Hi ! ' " Linda Cales said . <p> Anthony Cales returned to Downers Grove , selling the family 's home for money for the marina and moving the group to the home of a friend in Naperville . Within months , the family moved to Florida . <p> Cassandra Cales estimates the family moved between 20 and 30 times while she was growing up . <p> " The shortest time I ever went to school was two days , " Cassandra said . " Then we changed schools again because we moved . " <p> Anthony Cales drank heavily . So did his wife , Linda .

Stacy , she said , was a strong student , especially bright in science and history . <p> " Stacy was a good kid in a bad environment , " she said . <p> She loved playing with Klitzke 's babies . " She was a mom before she had kids , " Klitzke said . " When she lived with my mom and her dad , she did most of the cooking and took care of Cassandra while her brother was running in the streets .

The next year the couple separated , living in trailers . Soon after , Anthony and his children moved back to Illinois . The Caleses divorced in 2002 . <p> Despite the rough life on the road , the loving bond between Cassandra and Stacy was the constant . <p> " It was just me and her , we moved around so much , " Cassandra said . " It was all we had . " <p> Then one day , Drew Peterson appeared at the hotel where Stacy worked . They talked over coffee ; he would drop in during her shift . Months later , they became intimate , Stacy told Klitzke . <p> Savio divorced Peterson in 2003 after learning of the affair and that Stacy was pregnant .

Stacy seemed genuinely happy , though . <p> " There was the jewelry , he wined and dined her , " she said . " He was a knight in shining armor . " <p> While Stacy 's view of the marriage appeared to sour toward the end  --  family members said she wanted out  --  she thrived in her new role as a mother . She stocked pantries with food , determined to give her kids variety she did n't have growing up . She spent hours creating scrapbooks filled with pictures of the happy life she craved . <p> She and Cassandra talked every day until Oct. 28 , the day Stacy disappeared . Each day of silence further motivates Cassandra .
