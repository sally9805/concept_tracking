Headnote Life is not quite as messy for Sienna Miller as it appears in the tabloids-or on this page-but it has its juicy little dramas . And distractions . And chaos . Just not in the way you 'd expect . By David Katz // Sienna Miller is insisting she 's the " biggest fucking klutz in the world , " and while the claim is endearing , you take it as just another case of a beautiful actress claiming some flaw to make her seem more real , like she was ugly between the third and fourth grades or maybe she has dreadful peripheral vision . Miller , however , has arrived at the bar of the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan with proof of her clumsiness-a mangled thumb . " On a scale from one to ten , how bad is it ? " she asks , offering you her hand for inspection . It 's a lovely hand , mostly , and quite small , which is good because she is a small woman , smaller than you thought , actually-though , thank God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her movies , like Alfie , Casanova , and especially Layer Cake , or those ubiquitous paparazzi shots with ex-boyfriend Jude Law , Miller can come across as glamorously aloof or intimidatingly sultry , but sitting here in front of you , she 's more pixielike-especially with her once-long blond hair chopped Peter Pan short and wearing a little knit dress over black tights with pointy low suede boots . You bring her injured paw closer to the table candle to examine it . " I bite the skin on the side of my fingernails , " she confesses . " Someone once told me that there 's a whole psychology to it : either you 're self-destructive , so you want to hurt yourself , or you 're a narcissist , so you literally want to ingest yourself . " And which is she ? She grins and lights another cigarette . " Destructive , obviously . " But it 's not her damaged nails she wants you to consider . You inspect the swollen and bruised thumb and conclude that in your professional opinion , it is grotesque-bluish green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , she explains , she slammed it in her mom 's car door . Head sober . And it probably did n't help that her mom continued to drive for twenty seconds before realizing her daughter was still stuck , running alongside her , banging on the window-another thirty seconds and Nannygate could have given way to Tailgate . On a bodily-disfigurement scale , you give it a six . She is disappointed . It hurts like a seven , or maybe even an eight , especially when she bumps it while lighting cigarettes under the table , which she does often , sneaking puffs when she 's sure that none of the statuesque waitresses are looking over . Between drags she begins to tell you a bit about how she landed the role of the 1960s **31;3074;TOOLONG Edie Sedgwick . the doomed Warhol " superstar " who is the subject of Factory Girl-Miller 's first " proper fucking role , " as she deems it . " People ask me , " What is it about Edie Sedgwick-why do you care about her ? She was just a socialite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist-she wax her art . She changed the world even though she was only a blip on the horizon , " Miller says . She 's right . Sedgwick practically invented the modern naughty society girl as gossip celebrity . Factory Girl charts her transformation from Radcliffe art student to hipster style icon and national tabloid queen-which is to say she 's got a bit more in common with Miller than merely waify good looks . " Yeah , there are things about her that I relate to , " says Miller . " Her chaos , especially . We can both be really distracted and disorganized . Also , I like to dance . " Miller , twenty-five , comes from a semiprivileged background herself . Her father was in finance ( though now he 's writing a spiritual self-help book in the Virgin Islands ) , and her mother helped found the Lee Strasberg drama school in London and taught yoga . Sienna was educated at boarding schools in England , where she was , she says , " the girl who always got caught-drinking , smoking , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to pursue her art , enrolling in the Strasberg Institute here at eighteen .... And then she lets out a loud " Ah , fuck ! " Turns out the glowing cherry of her cigarette has fallen off its butt and into her new suede boots . She throws her leg in the air in front of you and pleads for you to take off her boot , which you do . revealing the spot where the ash has started to burn through her tights and into her calf . " You should really consider doing romantic comedy , " you suggest-and you mean it , not just because she may actually be as clumsy as she claims , but also because she 's clearly got way more silly charm and limber humor than she 's been able to show off in any of her films to date . Couple that with her unique bit of tashiony edge and she could easily be the Jennifer Aniston of the black-eyeliner set . Or something . In any case , havingnearly lit herself on fire , * Miller forgoes another cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck . " It 's a pocket-watch chain-my best friend bought it for me , " she explains , showing oil the little charms it bears . There 's one made out of two sharp shark 's teeth , which Miller playfully pokes your forearms with whenever you ask her a question she does n't like-say , about a certain nanny ; another charm reads NIAGARA FALLS , which is where she filmed the indie movie Camille ; and then there 's a pyramid charm with a little eye in it , " to protect me against evil , " she says . Has it been working ? " To be honest ... not so much . " The collective evil eye-the British tabloids , the blogs , Us Weekly-is something Sienna Rose Miller knows well : Since being publicly burned when Law , her now ex-fianc , cheated on her with the nanny of his three kids , nary a day goes by without some gossipy item on her , from the hilariously mundane ( Sienna Miller was spotted using her mobile phone in an airport security line ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photo of her grandfather 's tombstone to read " Slutty Miller . " ) As she recalls all these now-tired events , what strikes you most is her lack of bitterness . ( To Jude , that is ; she 's plenty bitter toward elements of the press . ) " It was a very loving , very close relationship , " she explains . " Obviously , we had our problems , but every single person I know has experienced infidelity . It 's not the first time it 's happened to me. and it probably wo n't be the last . " Still , she remains " pathologically optimistic " about love , she says , and seems only slightly less jaded now than the girl who at twenty fell for a yoga teacher in Guatemala and moved in with him for three months . You feel cynical by comparison . The scandal made Miller a famous actress who is not really famous tor being an actress , though to be fair , she was an actress long before she met Law , having landed Alfie ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wonder if there are n't some benefits to the extracurricular press ? " I can now be on the cover of certain magazines , which studios like because it promotes your film , " she acknowledges . " And yes , at times it can be fun , but it 's not important . And there are far more negatives from that kind of attention . Overall I think it hurt work . It 's harder for me to he taken seriously now . But I ca n't go hack . I ca n't change what 's happened . " What she can do , and what she is doing , is work hard . She busted her ass making Factory Girl . " For maybe two months after we wrapped , " she says , " I was still running around and actinga little bit crazy , like I was still in character .... It 's really quite fun being Edie Sedgwick . " ( Unless , of course , you 're Edie Sedgwick , who was twice institutionalized and died of a drug overdose at age twenty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's her movie . Miller is in almost every frame , and she gives one of those all-out , totally unself-conscious performances that people are going to talk about-especially if the producers leave in a few of the more explicit sex scenes that Miller 's hoping to get toned down . " I 'm not comfortable with gratuitous nudity. " she says , and then , laughing , " although I have done it an awful lot in my career . I guess I think if you 're gon na go for it , then go for it . " She 's going for it now-the eight ball , that is . Miller 's petite frame is stretched over the pool table , getting the right angle , about to take her shot . A few hours ago you did n't imagine Sienna Miller was the type of woman who would challenge you to a game of eight ball : you especially did not imagine she was the type of woman who was about to beat you in a game of eight ball with a badly busted thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's one thing you know for sure as she sinks her shot , spins around in girlish delight , and inadvertently smacks her pool cue into her vodka tonic , sending the glass flying off the table and breaking into a dozen pieces : Sienna Miller is the biggest fucking klutzin the world . Sidebar " I 'm working too hard to be able to devote any time to anyone , " Miller says , " but it is lovely being in love . I 've loved-this is dangerous ground , let 's get off it now .... " Sidebar After she posed for these photos , Miller confided : " I made out with the monkey on the shoot . The trainer said that if you blow on its mouth , he 'll look at you and try to kiss you , and I did . " ( For more on Simi , the monkey , see page 18 . ) Footnote * After that evening , Miller sent us the following text message : " There is a new book on Edie called Girl on Fire , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your article , do n't u think ?
