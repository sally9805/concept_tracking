At the end of World War II , Joseph Stalin 's personal movie library expanded . His army liberated Joseph Goebbels ' film collection . On movie nights in the old winter garden of the Great Kremlin Palace , Stalin and his gang ( a revolving cast of Bolshevik thugs and survivors ) would watch Charlie Chaplin or Spencer Tracy or Clark Gable . Stalin particularly liked gangster and cowboy films ; sexual content offended him . <P> Stalin  --  tyrant and village primitive  --  yammered all through the double feature , talking down the stars onscreen . At about 2 a.m. he would propose , as if spontaneously , " Let 's go and get something to eat . " No one said no . Everyone would ride 10 miles to Stalin 's dacha at Kuntsevo and begin another of the booze-fogged , terror-soaked marathon predawn dinners that the Minister of Cultural Terror , Yury Zhdanov , had convinced Stalin were the equivalent of the symposia of the ancient Greeks . " These vomit-flecked routs , " the British biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore observes in Stalin : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages ) , " were the closest Stalin came to cabinet government . " <P> The captive boyars of the Politburo discussed literature , made policy , denounced colleagues and drank like fish to numb the fear of being led away at dawn . Often , Montefiore records , the dinner " sank to the level of a Neanderthal stag night . " Stalin would get so drunk , Nikita Khrushchev remembered , that " he 'd throw a tomato at you . " Lavrenti Beria liked to slip tomatoes into the old Bolshevik Anastas Mikoyan 's suit pockets and push Mikoyan against a wall so that they exploded . <P> Montefiore 's portrait of Stalin and his circle is a deeply researched and wonderfully readable accomplishment  --  scholarship as a kind of savage gossip , history as a grisly Barbara Walters special , its sensationalism redeemed by Montefiore 's deep grounding in the facts . It is a brilliant stroke , in any case , to describe Stalin and his immense crimes , the blood of millions , with the sardonic contempt and tabloid brio to which Montefiore 's scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state archives , opened in 1999 , which " meant I was able to use a large amount of new , fascinating papers and photographs , including the letters of Stalin , his entourage and their families . " Montefiore interviewed scores of family members of the " magnates " who made up Stalin 's court and read a number of unpublished memoirs by those who were there . At age 38 , Montefiore seems to know as much as anyone else alive about the appalling tale . <P> The old story of Utopian Marxist ideological dream turned into brutal , malevolent history becomes , in this telling , an exploration of personality . Here we have Victor Abakumov , Stalin 's head of secret police : " Abakumov ... was another colorful , swaggering torturer , amoral condottiere and ' zoological careerist ' who possessed all Beria 's sadism but less of his intelligence . Abakumov unrolled a bloodstained carpet on his office floor before embarking on the torture of his victims in order not to stain his expensive Persian rugs . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
