Overworked and overextended , RNs are walking away from hospitals in shocking numbers . Those who remain are likely to be stressed out and stretched thin-and you may be paying the price . // After seven years on the job , Annie Polander , RN. , was used to pressure . At her hospital in Chicago , the intensive care nursery had been short-staffed for months , and the workload was so intense that nurses , fatigued and frustrated , frequently burst into tears-sometimes with sick babies in their arms . + " Every time I reported to the ICU , I 'd say the same prayer : God , let me make it through , " she recalls . " Please let me get out with these babies still alive . " + But on that November night in 1999 , as she dashed from task to task , Polander ( who asked that her name be changed ) believed that , for once , she was on top of everything she needed to get done . Then an alarm sounded , calling her to the crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special 24-hour infusion pump to slowly feed nutrients into his veins . Polander had just started the IV half an hour before . Now the alarm signaled the pump was empty . Polander realized that , in her haste , she 'd mistyped the dosage , sending a full day 's nutrients flooding into the baby in just a few minutes . + It was a mistake that could have proved fatal . Luckily , the infant suffered no permanent injuries . But the 37-year-old Polander , herself the mother of two small children , was devastated . " I wanted to roll up into a little ball and cry , " she says . " I do n't think this would have happened if we were n't all put in a situation where we were so stressed and overwhelmed . " That night , Polander was living out a scary truth about health care : Registered nurses are in such short supply at hospitals that those on the job sometimes harm the patients they 're working to help . " Hoping to save money , hospitals have been making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . That 's not just bad for nurses-it 's dangerous for anyone who becomes a hospital patient , " says Cheryl Johnson , president of United American Nurses , the labor arm of the American Nurses Association ( ANA ) . Although they disagree about what caused the dearth , participants and observers on all sides of the industry agree that the shortage is real and likely to become worse . According to the American Medical Association , almost 15 percent of nursing jobs nationwide are currently unfilled , with vacancy rates as high as 20 percent in bellwether states such as California . Younger nurses wo n't be filling those ranks . Enrollment in nursing schools has dropped every year since 1996 . Right now almost 70 percent of registered nurses are 40 or older . By 2020 , when most of today 's nurses will have retired and the aging baby boomers ' demand for nursing services will soar , the United States is expected to have 400,000 fewer RNs than it needs . Whatever the long-term solutions to this crisis may be , hospitals ' short-term response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced-is often used to stretch already too-small staffs . In a national survey by the ANA released in February 2001 , 44 percent of nurses reported that their facilities used mandatory overtime to cover staffing gaps . Photograph Nurse heroes Despite the challenges of their jobs , nurses save lives every day . Here , some RNs who deserve special recognition . Zeneida Roman was driving to her job at a Hartford hospital when she found herself at the scene of a grisly accident : an overturned motorcycle and a severed human leg . A moment later Roman spotted the victim , a woman , lying at the roadside bleeding uncontrollably . Roman stripped off her own blouse to make a tourniquet ( " I did n't want to waste time rummaging through my car for something else to use , " she says ) . Then , shirtless , she flagged down a motorist , who called for help . A helicopter arrived minutes later to take the injured woman to a trauma center . Roman stayed in touch , helping her new friend through the long , difficult recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , Roman was invited to the wedding . Darlene Frasher of Vienna , Virginia , was vacationing with her family in Florida in 1998 and waiting out a thunderstorm when she heard screams for help . A man fishing with his two young sons had been hit by lightning . Out on the dock in the midst of the torrential storm , Frasher performed CPR for 20 minutes on the unconscious , blue-lipped man . Thanks to her , the man recovered fully , suffering only a dime-size burn on his temple and minor hearing loss . Frasher says , " I was just doing what I 'd been trained to do . " Pamela J. Botka , a care manager at the Cardiac Surgical Service at Morristown Memorial Hospital , in New Jersey , went to bat for a 23-year-old patient with very special needs : She suffered from Lou Gehrig 's disease ( also known as ALS ) , needed a ventilator to breathe-and she was also pregnant . Her husband wanted to care for her at home , but his job kept him away 12 hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for private nursing services . And she helped obtain a special emergency visa that allowed the couple to bring in the help they really wanted : the husband 's mother , who came all the way from Hungary . Alison Goodman , then a nurse at Wesley Medical Center , in Wichita , Kansas , was so concerned about staffing at her hospital in 1998 that she kept a diary of events and copies of official memos and reports of substandard care . After 61 - year- old Shirley Keck was left unattended on an understaffed unit , resulting in permanent brain damage , Goodman provided her notes to the Keck family and helped them win a $2.7 million settlement . When the hospital discovered Goodman 's role , they fired her . // * Many hospitals are bringing in nurses who are either temporary , recruited from foreign countries such as the Philippines , or " floated " from another unit in the same facility . That can mean more work for staff nurses , since nurses in these categories are often unfamiliar with unit procedures and equipment . * Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on timeconsuming , unskilled , but necessary tasks such as cleaning rooms and transporting patients . * An alarming 41 percent of the RNs surveyed by the ANA said they would not want a member of their own family to be a patient at the facility where they work . Patients at risk If you 're lying in a hospital bed , nurses are your lifeline . They monitor your condition ; they hook up and oversee your intravenous line , infusion pump , ventilator , or any other vital equipment you need . They double-check your physicians ' drug orders to protect you from accidental overdose and other errors , and they administer your medications . But if nurses are in short supply , even the most essential of these duties may be neglected-as Aleen Golis , a nurse-practitioner from Hot Springs , South Dakota , discovered when she was admitted to a Denver hospital in 2001 for post-cancer pelvic surgery . After her operation , Golis emerged from anesthesia to find a ward so understaffed that her vital signs went unchecked for almost seven hours , despite the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , a harried temporary nurse mishandled an IV and sent fluids into the tissues of Golis 's arm , an error that could have caused permanent damage if this particular patient had n't had the training to notice the problem and turn off the IV herself . " It was very scary , " she says . " Luckily I had family there , including a few who are nurses . These days , it 's safest to provide your own nursing care . " Quality at risk Administrators argue that , in a managed-care world , they must stretch staff to make ends meet-yet the practices that are so dangerous to patients are hurting , not helping , the hospitals ' bottom lines . Candy Weiland , an intensive care nurse in California , offers an example . One morning in September 1999 , she was told to wean two severely ill patients off their ventilators , an hourslong process that requires a nurse to stay at the bedside , providing reassurance and continually monitoring progress as the ventilator settings are lowered . Since Weiland was the sole available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time . But while she was doing so , the second patient 's ventilator was turned down by an overworked respiratory therapist who then hurried off , leaving the patient alone , fighting for breath and terrified . " He suffered a serious setback , " Weiland reports . " Of course , his family had absolutely no idea that that was why he was put back on the ventilator for two extra days . " In the fee-for-service era , those two days would have meant more money for the hospital . But under managed care , hospitals are generally paid a flat fee . If poor care causes a patient to stay longer , the hospital must absorb the extra costs . In 2000 , a landmark settlement established what common sense suggests : Staff skimping is not compatible with quality care . The lawsuit brought by the family of Shirley Keck was one of the first to hold a hospital responsible for negligent nurse staffing . Keck nearly died of pneumonia in a Wichita , Kansas , hospital while her daughter frantically begged for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and although she was later revived , she suffered permanent brain damage . The unit , with 41 critically ill patients , was supposed to be staffed with five RNs and two licensed practical nurses , but only three RNs were on duty , with no LPN backup . The hospital insisted the staffing was adequate but eventually agreed to a $2.7 million settlement . Roots of the shortage just a few years ago , hospitals adjusting to the managed-care revolution seemed to have too many nurses , not too few . In the 1990s , institutions across the country saw dramatic drops in the length of stays , huge increases in the number of outpatient procedures , and deep cuts in what hospitals are paid for any given treatment . Revenues fell , and administrators reacted by cutting back on their single biggest labor cost : nurses . Those still on the job faced new and difficult conditions . " Healthy " patients  --  those who come to the hospital to have a baby or minor surgery-find themselves discharged almost immediately . Anyone who stays for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and concentrated care . At the same time , new medical technologies and techniques are saving desperately sick people whose lives are very much in the balance . So hospitals that were laying off nurses are now trying to recruit . But they 're discovering that , although there are 2.7 million RNs , fewer and fewer of them are willing to work in hospitals . One reason is that pay has not improved . Salaries , which average $40,000 annually , have remained stagnant ( when adjusted for inflation ) since 1992 . Even more important , nurses say , is that the stress , fatigue , and anxiety of hospital work are becoming unbearable-and thousands have gone on strike to protest . While some nurses walk the picket line , others are just walking . According to a study by the International Hospital Outcomes Research Consortium released last May , fully 33 percent of nurses younger than 30 planned to leave the profession within a year , primarily because of working conditions . Many older nurses feel the same . " I was employed at one hospital for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nurse in California 's Napa Valley . " There was a lot of auxiliary staff to help the nurses , and the patients got really good care . " But when the hospital began cutting back in the mid-1990s , support staff vanished while patient loads increased . " It was an assembly line , " Berkowitz says . " You 'd give a patient medicine and just hope you 'd have time to check them two hours later to make sure they did n't die from it . I dreaded going to work every day . " Two years ago , Berkowitz quit her hospital job and took a substantial pay cut to work in a doctor 's office . Search for solutions Hospitals , nursing groups , and labor unions are all turning to Congress and state legislatures for help . In the coming year , despite the recession , we should be seeing substantial boosts in everything from scholarship programs for new nursing students to subsidies for nursing faculties . More controversial are efforts to ban mandatory overtime and set minimum staffing standards . Hospitals bitterly oppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and overregulate an already struggling industry . Some hospitals have found ways to solve their own problems . At the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago , the hospital where Annie Polander made her terrifying mistake , executives were struggling with a $15 million deficit , and the center 's nursing vacancy rate was between 12 percent and 15 percent . When John DeNardo was appointed the medical center 's new executive director a few months later , he took a different approach , redirecting money that had been going to pay overtime and temporary nurses into recruiting a full-time nursing staff . He and his team also upgraded the equipment and technologies nurses used . Morale improved dramatically , and so did clinical outcomes , patient satisfaction , and financial performance . The nursing vacancy rate has dropped to 5 percent , and the hospital is now $2 million in the black . " A strong , stable nursing staff results in better quality of care , " DeNardo says . " And that 's also better business . " Aleen Golis agrees . " Nurses have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But for anything to change , the public has to get upset about what 's happening .
