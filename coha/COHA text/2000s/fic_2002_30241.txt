Things You Should Know A Collection of Stories The Chinese Lesson I am walking , holding a small screen , watching the green dot move like the blip of a plane , the blink of a ship 's radar . Searching . I am on the lookout for submarines . I am an air traffic controller trying to keep everything at the right distance . I am lost . A man steps out of the darkness onto the sidewalk . " Plane gone down ? " he asks . It is nearly night ; the sky is still blue at the top , but it is dark down here . " I was just walking the dog , " he says . I nod . The dog is nowhere to be seen . " You 're not from around here are you ? " " Not originally , " I say . " But we 're over on Maple now . " " Tierney , " the man says . " John Tierney . " " Harris , " I say . " Geordie Harris .

Are you driving a car or floating a boat somewhere around here ? " " It 's a chip , " I say , cutting him off . " A global positioning screen . I 'm looking for my mother-in-law . " There is a scratching sound from inside a nearby privet , and the unmistakable scent of dog shit rises like smoke . " Good boy , " Tierney says . " He does n't like to do his business in public . Ca n't blame him  --  if they had me shitting outside , I 'd hide in the bushes too . " Tierney  --  I hear it like tyranny . Tyrant , teaser , taunting me about my tracking system , my lost mother-in-law . " It 's not a game , " I say , looking down at the blinking green dot .

The cell phone clipped to my belt rings . " Who was that ? " Susan asks . " Was that someone you know ? " " It was a stranger , a total stranger , looking for a playmate . " I glance down at the screen . " She does n't seem to be moving now . " " Is your antenna up ? " Susan asks . There is a pause . I hear her talking to Kate . " See Daddy . See Daddy across the street , wave to Daddy . Kate 's waving , " she tells me . I stare across the road at the black Volvo idling by the curb . With my free hand I wave back .

I step off the sidewalk and dart between the houses , through the grass alley that separates one man 's yard from another 's . A sneak , a thief , a prowling trespasser , I pull my flashlight out of my jacket and flick it on . The narrow Ever Ready beam catches patios and planters and picnic tables by surprise . I am afraid to call out , to attract attention . Ahead of me there is a basketball court , a slide , a sandbox , and there she is , sailing through my beam like an apparition . Her black hair blowing , her hands smoothly clutching the chain-link ropes of the swing as though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging in and out . I hold the light on her there and gone . " I 'm flying , " she says , sailing through the night . I step in close so that she has to stop swinging . " Did you have a pleasant flight , Mrs. Ha ? " " It was nice . " " Was there a movie ? " She eases herself off the swing and looks at me like I 'm crazy . She looks down at the tracking device . " It 's no game , " Mrs. Ha says , putting her arm through mine . I lead her back through the woods . " What 's for dinner , Georgie ? " she says . And I hear the invisible echo of Susan 's voice correcting  --  it 's not Georgie , it 's Geordie . " What would you like , Mrs. Ha ? " In the distance , a fat man presses against a sliding glass door , looking out at us , his breath fogging the pane . Susan is at the computer , drawing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is giving us something to go on in the future  --  coordinates . She is an architect , everything is line , everything is order . Our house is G4 . The blue light of the screen pours over her , pressing the flat planes of her face flatter still  --  illuminating . She hovers in an eerie blue glow . " I called Ken , " I say . Ken is the one who had the chip put in . He is Susan 's brother . When Mrs. Ha was sedated for a colonoscopy , Ken had the chip implanted at the bottom of her neck , above her shoulder blades . The chip company specialist came and stood by while a plastic surgeon inserted it just under the skin . Before they let her go home , they tested it by wheeling her gurney all over the hospital while Ken sat in the waiting room tracking her on the small screen . " Why ? " " I called him about her memory . I was wondering if we should increase her medication . " Ken is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He used to be a stoner and now he is a shrink . He has no affect , no emotions . " And ? " she says . " He asked if she seemed agitated . " " She seems perfectly happy , " Susan says . " I know , " I say , not telling Susan what I told Ken  --  Susan is the one who 's agitated . " Does she know where she is ? " Ken had asked . There had been a pause , a moment where I wondered if he was asking about Susan or his mother . " I 'm not always sure , " I 'd said , failing to differentiate .
