<p> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked the leading gubernatorial candidates to speak to some of today 's most pressing issues . The AJC printed the responses from Cathy Cox and Mark Taylor in last week 's Metro sections . Gov . Sonny Perdue declined to participate . Here are highlights from those interviews . <p> EDUCATION <p> HOPE SCHOLARSHIPS <p> What , if anything , would you propose to ensure that HOPE scholarships are available for future generations of college-goers ? <p> Cathy Cox : We can protect the HOPE scholarship by ensuring that tuition remains affordable at Georgia 's colleges and universities while providing adequate funding at those schools so that they remain some of the best in the nation . As governor , I will veto any attempts to cut or dismantle the HOPE scholarship . <p> Mark Taylor : We ca n't ignore the relationship between tuition and HOPE . Tuition costs are soaring , and tuition increases on top of tuition increases are unacceptable . HOPE benefits have been cut , and that is wrong . The very politicians who opposed the creation of HOPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and they will cut HOPE again if given the chance . As governor , I will restore the cuts to the HOPE scholarship , every last dime . <p> SCHOOL FUNDING <p> Do you believe public schools are adequately funded ? If not , how would you fix the problem ? <p> Cox : Under Sonny Perdue there have been more than $1 billion in education investment cuts . We absolutely must restore those cuts if we are serious about giving our children the opportunity to succeed . My top priority as governor will be to address the serious challenges we face in educating our children and that means making education a budget priority , not just an election-year priority . <p> Taylor : The first thing we can do is to stop the cuts to education . When you cut more than $1 billion from our schools and do nothing about overcrowded classrooms , then our schoolkids suffer and test scores drop . We need to restore the cuts to education and lower class sizes . In 2004 , I sponsored a constitutional amendment to lower class size in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our teachers and students have the resources to spend their time teaching and learning . <p> THE ENVIRONMENT <p> ON WATER <p> Is enough being done to ensure our supplies beyond 2030 ? If not , what should state government do ? <p> Cox : The state must develop a comprehensive , science- and resource-based water plan . Sonny Perdue has n't allocated even 10 percent of what the Environmental Protection Division needs to research and develop a statewide water plan that will ensure all Georgians have reliable access to water for generations to come . As governor , I will give the EPD the resources they need to do just that . <p> Taylor : We need a better advocate for Georgia in the governor 's office . Requesting a personal meeting with Alabama and Florida to discuss a water crisis two days after suing them is not leadership . ... If we ignore the need for more aggressive conservation of water , we are shortchanging future generations . I do n't really think that 's a fair way to treat the people of Georgia . The results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How will you solve the fight between Georgia , Florida and Alabama over the Chattahoochee River , and how will you resolve the conflicts between metro Atlanta  --  which is seen as a water hog  --  and the rest of the state ? <p> Cox : This is an area that requires real leadership and a leader that can put partisanship and political gamesmanship aside . As secretary of state , I 've built consensus in the Legislature to get my initiatives passed . And , as governor , I will bring that same leadership to working with our neighboring states to solve our water problems . But any resolution will require that we first have a comprehensive , science- and resource-based water plan to guide any and all decisions on water usage . <p> Taylor : The governor of Georgia must work aggressively to cause Georgia  --  both urban and rural  --  to present a united front in the Georgia-Alabama-Florida water dispute . Georgia must stay at the negotiating table as previous governors did rather than turning our future over to lawyers and judges and uncertain litigation . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . is the road map for our water future . <p> TRANSPORTATION <p> TRAFFIC <p> Traffic in metro Atlanta already is bad . How should we address the problem knowing that the region expects to add more than 2 million people over the next 25 years ? <p> Cox : I believe it is vitally important to create a regional transportation system that will seamlessly move people throughout the metro area . Every world-class city has a high-quality public transportation network , and a similar network is necessary for Atlanta to become a top-tier city as well . That is why I have put an emphasis on creating transportation options , such as commuter rail , in my Transportation Agenda for a 21st Century Georgia . <p> Taylor : Georgia currently invests in transportation at two-thirds the national average . This problem is growing daily , and we must have regional solutions to address it . Our balanced approach must include investments in both mass transit and roads . <p> COMMUTER RAIL <p> A debate surfaced last legislative session about the wisdom of building commuter rail lines in Georgia . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fully support commuter rail projects such as the proposed lines from Athens to Atlanta ( the " Brain Train " ) and from Atlanta to Lovejoy and eventually to Macon . Sonny Perdue and the leaders at the state Capitol were wrong to use a backroom deal this year to insert at the 11th hour a moratorium on funding for commuter rail projects . <p> Taylor : The metro Atlanta area needs regional transportation solutions . There is not one single fix . I support both the Atlanta to Lovejoy line and the Brain Train , but I believe these initiatives must be accompanied by the kind of regional planning that is currently being done by the Atlanta Regional Commission and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority . These entities need to be more than names , and the governor must lead on this issue . You ca n't just make sure the stoplights are timed in downtown Atlanta . You have to look at the big picture . <p> HEALTH CARE <p> THE UNINSURED <p> The number of Georgians without health insurance has been rising . How do you propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing in affordable and accessible health care is investing in every Georgian because a healthier work force will make Georgia more competitive and ready for the economic challenges of the future . I 've proposed creating a health insurance purchasing pool for small business and the self-employed with a minimum level of benefits and the choice of at least two plans . I am also committed to improving access to existing programs and using more of the available federal funding to expand health care coverage to more of Georgia 's children . <p> Taylor : I have fought for health care my entire career  --  a fight that led to PeachCare , a program that provides health coverage for more than 247,000 Georgians . The cost of health care has spiraled out of control , and it 's costing us the general health of our families . Almost 100,000 kids have no insurance here in Georgia . These are families without health care who make too much money to qualify for help . Others have lost their jobs due to no fault of their own , and with the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I have proposed the PeachKids program . It provides basic health care insurance for children . Every family can qualify because there are no income caps . Co-payments are structured on income . <p> MEDICAID <p> Medicaid spending keeps increasing . What can be done to contain these costs while maintaining the quality of patients ' medical care ? <p> Cox : Medicaid is increasingly becoming a greater share of our state budget , but we ca n't lose sight of the importance of providing health care for those Georgians who need it the most . I believe that every Georgian deserves affordable and accessible health care . In the last four years , however , the Perdue administration has lost sight of that priority and this year enacted a confusing new program that already is over budget by $450 million . During my term as secretary of state , I implemented cost-saving measures and streamlined our office to improve customer service . Every year I 've been in office , I 've returned millions to Georgia taxpayers . That 's the kind of leadership I will bring to strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be solved . Medicaid is part of the solution to the million and a half Georgians who are uninsured and the disparities in our health system . Ultimately , we have to partner with health care providers to help us stretch our dollars . We also need to focus on lifestyle changes and preventive care investment in public health care as well as the management of chronic illnesses . In addition , Gov . Perdue 's move to managed care means we are forgoing government dollars and this is unacceptable . In addition , he has raised the expenses for thousands of elderly people across Georgia by eliminating the medically needy program . <p> BIGGEST CHALLENGE <p> What 's the biggest health care issue facing Georgians now and what can be done about it ? <p> Cox : The most important health care issue facing Georgians today is the lack of access to affordable health insurance . Georgia moves forward when everyone  --  regardless of income  --  has access to affordable health care . In the last four years , our leaders at the state Capitol cut children from PeachCare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals ; and access to needed prescription drugs was restricted . My proposal will expand access to affordable care and reduce the cost of prescription drugs . <p> Taylor : The rising cost of medicine is hurting Georgia 's families , young and old . They are as critical to today 's families as groceries , and it 's time we started treating them that way . So , just as we did with groceries , now it is time to take the sales tax off all medicines , every drug you buy , including over-the-counter medicines . I also am proposing a plan I call Georgia Rx , which will use the power of Georgia 's government combined with the marketing potential of all uninsured Georgians to negotiate discounted prices for prescription drugs with manufacturers . An added benefit of this plan is that it will cost the taxpayers of Georgia nothing . Finally , we must pass PeachKids , which not only will take care of children 's preventative medical care , but will help with the prescription drugs our children so desperately need to grow up healthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state do to bring more jobs to Georgia ? <p> Cox : " I plan to create a business retention council that would help me work with existing companies . " The idea , she said , is to get a jump on coming up with a plan to get Georgia businesses thinking of moving out of state to stay . She also wants to put up more attractive incentive packages to recruit business , meaning the state may wind up spending more to attract jobs . Also , she wants the state to put more money into college research on alternative fuels and provide incentives for alternative-fuel businesses and users . " I want us to be the farm-grown fuel capital of the world . " <p> Taylor : We need a much more aggressive approach to bringing jobs to all of Georgia , and I have spent a great deal of my career working on these issues . The major structural challenge we face is education . We are not going to be successful in attracting good-paying jobs with benefits unless we can improve our test scores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation rates . That is why I am proposing to stop the annual cuts to our local school systems . <p> GAS PRICES <p> What should be done to control the rising cost of gasoline ? <p> Cox : She supports suspending the sales tax increase on gas that went into effect July 1 . " In the big picture , what I would like to see us do is move to a flat tax per gallon so as not to penalize drivers as gas prices go up . " <p> Taylor : We do play a role , and I would immediately suspend the collection of the sales tax increase that has hit Georgia motorists . The sales tax increase will increase the prices at the pump almost 3 cents a gallon . Secondly , I believe that we need to enhance the number of Revenue Department officials that are monitoring spikes in gasoline prices at the retail level . We need transportation alternatives in the metro Atlanta area . Photo : Mark Taylor
