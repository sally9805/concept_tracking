<p> Someti1mes in football , though hardly always , things work out just the way they should . <p> John Elway becomes the champion he always had been , even if he never had a Super Bowl ring to prove it . Kurt Warner , as good as a Boy Scout off the field and better than Otto Graham on it , authors a more unbelievable story than ' The Green Mile . ' And now this . <p> Four years ago , the hottest coaching candidate out there was Jimmy Johnson . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers made him their first choice . The Miami Dolphins made him their first choice . Every team that had an opening made him their first choice . <p> But Johnson , then a TV analyst , wanted the Dolphins job . He had been subtly campaigning for it ever since he was publicly and highly critical of then-Dolphins coach Don Shula . Eventually , Johnson got what he wanted . So did Miami . Shula was let go . Johnson was named the Dolphins coach . Miami figured , oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Right after he blew back into town , Johnson attended a charity function with South Florida 's other three pro coaches - the Miami Heat 's Pat Riley , the Florida Marlins ' Jim Leyland and the Florida Panthers ' Doug MacLean . Each of those coaches was about winning every day . But was Johnson impressed ? Not with anyone but himself . <p> At the luncheon , he wiped away all civic smiles and insulted his coaching brethren by proclaiming , ' I 'm here to be better than all of you . ' Classy . <p> While Miami got its man , Tampa Bay did n't . Buccaneers owner Malcolm Glazer moved to the next man on his list , University of Florida coach Steve Spurrier . Like Johnson , Spurrier rejected the Buccaneers . So with his options quickly and depressingly dwindling , Glazer turned to his distant No. 3 choice , Tony Dungy . <p> Dungy humbly strolled into town . No boasts . No proclamations . Few expectations other than to turn around an organization that was one of the biggest jokes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , was under way . <p> But down south in Miami , Johnson 's teams struggled to achieve the success he boasted they would . During his first season , Johnson failed to make the playoffs . During his second season , he lost his opening playoff game to New England 17-3 . During his third season , he got whipped at Denver in the AFC semifinals 38-3 . And then last week , in the second-most lopsided playoff game in NFL history , in the ultimate embarrassment , Johnson lost 62-7 to Jacksonville . <p> The next day , after four seasons in which he compiled a 36-28 record - worse than the 39-25 record Shula posted during his final four seasons in Miami - Johnson retired . For once , Johnson had less to say than the always-classy Dungy . <p> Meanwhile , Dungy transformed the Buccaneers into winners . In two seasons , he returned them to the playoffs . In four seasons , he got them to their first NFC Championship game since the 1979 season , which his team will play today at St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull one of the great NFL playoff upsets in history , Dungy would become the first black coach to lead his team to a Super Bowl . <p> ' I want to see us go for the Buccaneers , first and foremost , ' said Dungy , who has made most of Tampa Bay forget it ever was interested in Johnson and Spurrier . ' But that would be a historic thing , and I would be overjoyed if it does happen . ' <p> Of course , while many root for it , no one expects it . But then , things already have worked out the way they should . Johnson goes home , and Dungy goes for history . <p> THE AFC <p> Funny how the AFC Central was considered the conference 's worst division , its weakling . Yet it has produced both participants in today 's AFC Championship game . ' From the time I got here in ' 95 , I thought the AFC Central was the division to beat , ' Titans quarterback Steve McNair said . ' And we have shown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is a contender . ' <p> Dolphins guard Kevin Donnalley believes the football world has underestimated the Jaguars , just as it has underestimated the AFC Central . ' You better take notice of this team , ' Donnalley said . ' It 's not the same team that struggled at times this year . Fred Taylor is back , the defense is playing outstanding . Other teams better look out . ' <p> Lorenzo Neal , the first Titans player to touch the football on the Immaculate Deception , spent last season with the Buccaneers . The fullback 's idea of fantasy football is two upsets today and the Titans and Bucs squaring off in Super Bowl XXXIV . ' Warren Sapp already called and left me a message , ' Neal said . ' He said , ' You got to get by them ( Jaguars ) before you meet us . ' I called him back , and I said , ' I 'll see you in Atlanta , buddy ! " <p> Instant replay was brought back precisely to do what it did last Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is why replay should be retained , and why fans want it retained . During a recent Internet poll on NFL.com , fans voted 34,187 to 4,617 in favor of keeping replay . Owners will make the final call at the NFL meetings in Palm Beach , Fla. , in March <p> While the Colts ' Peyton Manning dejectedly dressed at his locker after last Sunday 's loss to the Titans , there were other quarterbacks who knew what he was going through . Surrounding Manning were his father , Archie ; his brother , Eli ; and Purdue 's Drew Brees <p> Colts coach Jim Mora is 0-5 in playoff games , with four of those losses coming at home . ' I 'm not going to go out and commit suicide or get drunk or anything like that , ' Mora said . ' I 'll wake up tomorrow and go back to work . ' And go back to figuring out a way to win his first playoff game <p> Off-season is turning out to be a little busier than Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Fritz Shurmur as defensive coordinator . Now , with the Packers luring Mike Sherman to Green Bay , Holmgren has to hire an offensive coordinator . But any assistant should want the job . Holmgren has helped train four NFL head coaches : Philadelphia 's Andy Reid , Oakland 's Jon Gruden , Chicago 's Dick Jauron and San Francisco 's Steve Mariucci <p> Odd how Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga would just hand his team over to Dave Wannstedt , who did a bad coaching job in Chicago , without interviewing another candidate . Dolphins president Eddie Jones had prepared a list of candidates for Huizenga that included the University of Florida 's Steve Spurrier , the University of Miami 's Butch Davis , Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dom Capers and St. Louis offensive coordinator Mike Martz as well as Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick , each formerly of the Jets . ' As we got closer and closer to it , we came to the conclusion that , hey , you take any one of these lists , and usually the guy who gets right close to the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Jones said . Aside from the Dolphins , what other team had Wannstedt near the top of its list ? <p> Some of the strongest comments about what Dan Marino should do came from former Jaguars and Jets defensive end Jeff Lageman , now a TV analyst in Jacksonville . ' He needs to get out , ' Lageman said . ' I remember the Dan of old . It hurts to see him like that . It hurt just watching him jogging out on the field during warm-ups ( before the Dolphins ' 62-7 playoff loss ) . He 's the greatest competitor I 've gone against , and it 's hard to tell a competitor like that it 's time to go . But it is . ' <p> THE NFC <p> The only chance the low-scoring Buccaneers would appear to have against the high-scoring Rams is a low-scoring game . But the fewest points the Rams have scored this season ( 21 ) came in a three-point loss at Tennessee . The Bucs , meanwhile , scored more than 20 points only six times this season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play keepaway . It is exactly what the New York Giants did to Buffalo during Super Bowl XXV the week after the Bills destroyed the Raiders 51-3 and looked as unbeatable as the Rams do now . And the Bucs did hold the NFL 's No. 2 scoring offense , the Redskins , without a single offensive touchdown last week <p> The Rams do not lack weapons and confidence . After beating the Vikings last Sunday to advance to today 's NFC Championship game , St. Louis Pro Bowl defensive end Kevin Carter said : ' We do n't lose in the dome . ' Rams Pro Bowl wide receiver Isaac Bruce said : ' I had a great time , and I expect to have a great time next week . We are n't overlooking Tampa Bay . We expect a physical game . We expect another victory . ' <p> This season , Rams quarterback Kurt Warner threw 41 touchdown passes , third in NFL history behind the 48 Dan Marino threw in 1984 and the 44 Marino threw in ' 86 . But Rams running back Marshall Faulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For that reason , Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter believes Faulk - not Warner - should have been the NFL 's MVP . ' When you 've had a season that no one else has ever had before , there 's no way they could have done what they 've done without Marshall , ' Carter said . ' Could they have done what they 've done without Kurt ? I do n't know that . That would be difficult . But I know they could have put up a lot of points . ' <p> File this one under the what-could-have-been category . Had the Bears hired Arizona defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis as their coach last year , as they intended , McGinnis intended to hire Mike Martz as his offensive coordinator . Instead , McGinnis turned down the job and Martz became the Rams ' offensive coordinator instead . Now , McGinnis barely is mentioned among the hot coaching candidates . And none is hotter than Martz , who agreed last week to succeed Dick Vermeil <p> Vermeil could be leaving sooner than people realize . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win this season 's Super Bowl , Vermeil will walk away to be with his wife , three children and 11 grandchildren , all on his 100-acre ranch in Pennsylvania <p> It 's great to be a Rams fans and a pizza lover . Each of the 79 Domino 's Pizza stores in St. Louis has been running the ' Rams Touchdown Takedown ' special , in which there 's a dollar off for each touchdown the Rams score . Last Sunday it was seven , so a medium cheese pizza - normally $ 7.99 - cost only 99 cents on Monday . The promotion , running since Oct. 25 , cost Domino 's about $ 1 million just last week <p> The Vikings plan to let their punter , former University of Colorado standout Mitch Berger , explore the free-agent market . Many around the NFL believe Berger will be able to land a five-year deal worth between $ 1 million and $ 1.5 million per season <p> Also , the Vikings plan to dump wide receiver Jake Reed , brother of Broncos cornerback Dale Carter . Reed is entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract and , with the emergence of Matthew Hatchette , the Vikings have a sure way to reduce their payroll . If he is willing to be a No. 3 receiver , maybe Denver can reunite Reed with Carter <p> One of these days , Michael Westbrook is going to make his mark with his catches , not with his antics . Just before the Redskins played the Bucs , Westbrook called Tampa Bay 's defensive backs ' average . ' Then the former CU star went out and caught one pass for 4 yards . ' Guess that 's pretty ' average ' for him , ' Bucs safety John Lynch said . @p#
