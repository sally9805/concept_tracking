It 's usually late at night or Saturdays when Bambie Argyle shows up for graduate school at the University of Nebraska . Done with household and other duties , it 's her turn at the family computer in a rugged Wyoming town called Mountain View . The Lincoln campus is 770 miles away . <p> Argyle settles in the playroom and logs on to read lecture texts , get assignments , join class discussion by e-mail and take quizzes . She also does research , like a required virtual museum tour . <p> " What a great opportunity for me to live so far from a university , have a busy life as a wife and mom and also as a high school teacher , " said Argyle of earning a master 's in Family and Consumer Science - formerly home ec . It costs about $650 per course for tuition and books . " But I do n't have to go anywhere , " she said . " I do n't have to worry about travel time . I do n't have to worry about leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students attending college online . As high school seniors head off to college , as working people and at-home parents contemplate picking up a postponed degree or earning another , great numbers are signing up for class in cyberspace . <p> While many students in online classes are past the typical college age of 18-24 , experts say , such courses are also taking root in the conventional undergraduate experience . <p> When Eric Hoffman was deciding where to apply to college , the San Diego high school senior leaned toward schools with many online courses . " It 's definitely an advantage , " said the 17-year-old , who 's seeking admission at about 10 schools . <p> Hoffman wants to be a doctor . He figures the convenience of one or two online courses each semester will help pack in the pre-med learning he needs . Since college is a lot of " taking notes and writing essays , " he said , online " you could kind of do it whenever you want to in your dorm room . " <p> Format , presentation and technology of online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in text on class Web sites , in streaming video , in real time or on the student 's time , even old-fashioned videotapes sent by mail . <p> Class discussion takes place by e-mail , in special class chat rooms , or by telephone . While students may never meet the professor or fellow students in the flesh , some online courses include opportunities for such encounters . <p> Tests , essays and term papers still play a part . For a final exam now , however , the professor may ask the student to find a local teacher or librarian to serve as proctor . <p> How many are enrolled ? The most recent federal survey of distance education in all its variation estimated a 1.4 million enrollment in such college-level courses for credit . But that was in the 1997-98 academic year , and figures in the fast-growing field quickly grow outdated . Participation is in the millions , experts say . <p> Around 75 percent of the nation 's established two- and four-year colleges and universities have some online presence - so-called brick to click , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which helps institutions enter the online market . <p> No need for a student to stick to one school , however . Offerings from many schools make up the catalogue of new entities like Kentucky Virtual University , which provides links to online courses statewide and grants degrees , and Western Governors University , which builds degrees based on an individual 's career expertise and offers links to online courses nationwide . In March , the nation 's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities plan to present all their online offerings through JesuitNET . <p> Fairleigh Dickinson University is creating an online course for next fall 's freshmen , the first class required to take at least one online course every semester . The private New Jersey school wants its graduates comfortable researching , exploring and relating in cyberspace . <p> Skeptics have wondered , however , if the Web can truly equal the lectern and chalkboard . <p> Such questions followed the launch of Concord University School of Law , which began offering law degrees entirely online in 1998 . The Los Angeles-based school is owned by educational services firm Kaplan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has expressed concern about the concept this way : " I am uneasy about classes in which students learn entirely from home , in front of a computer screen , with no face-to-face reaction with other students and instructors . " <p> Concord Dean Jack Goetz responds to doubters : " As an online law school , we have built in a tremendous number of feedback mechanisms that provide students with information on how they 're doing . " Professors tailor discussions , he said , and reach out to students who need help . <p> Concord lacks accreditation by the American Bar Association , which requires students to be physically present in schools . But Concord graduates may take the California bar exam and practice in some federal courts . And 600 students are enrolled in its programs . <p> One is Floyd Chapman . His first try at a traditional law school ran aground , he said , over travel conflicts for his job at a financial services firm . Now the 42-year-old marketing director attends law school in his den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses stimulating , with loads of faculty interaction . And it 's far from easy . " I get the same trepidations and anxieties as with any professional study . " His employer believes in what Chapman 's doing , reimbursing him for tuition and books . And , Chapman said , upper management is already tapping him to analyze proposals and contracts . <p> When Lee Benbenek needed to fulfill a fine-arts requirement last year at two-year Triton College in River Grove , Ill. , he was intrigued by a theater course offered in a regular classroom as well as online . <p> Benbenek was soon raving to friends : " I 'm taking a class where I do n't even have to show up ! " <p> The same lecture delivered in the classroom was posted in text form on the class Web site for online students . All students had to keep up with the required reading , but in place of classroom discussion online students responded to the readings by e-mail for all the class to read . <p> Now 21 , Benbenek transferred his Triton credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech communication . That online theater course taught him the economy of words , and to buckle down , he said . " You did n't just learn the material . You learned how and when to study the material . It was total discipline . " <p> Benbenek likes the social contact of college too much to go completely online . " The whole point of going to college is learning the book material , and disciplining yourself and learning about people from all over the world , " he said . <p> Sometimes , online is the only option . <p> Colorado State University , for instance , requires many science majors to take histology - the microscopic study of organic tissue . It 's offered solely online . For three years , associate professor Sherry McConnell offered her histology students an online alternative . Though it was never listed in the catalogue , word spread far from the Fort Collins campus , to students who signed on in Arizona and New York . <p> McConnell loves the give-and-take of the classroom and felt online would be a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new way of teaching just as enjoyable . <p> Her online course also proved more accommodating to students holding full-time jobs or looking after families . Best of all , she said , " The results were so astounding , it was clear to me students were doing better with the online class . " <p> Students praise the flexibility of this form of learning . But they caution it demands self-discipline and motivation . Online courses can entail more reading and attention than sitting in class soaking up a lecture . They require adjustment to various professors ' different software and presentations , and an ability to create a quadrangle of the mind . <p> And it can be lonely . <p> " I will probably never see these people , ever , " said Argyle , the Wyoming graduate student . " After you 've taken a few classes , I know how old their kids are , or that they 're divorced . " Still , there 's no substitute for setting eyes on someone , sharing the same air . <p> Along with staying motivated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , not having a personal bond with these students , or the teacher ... the lack of having them know who I am . " <p> But there was no other way for Argyle in her quest for more education , short of leaving home . The nearest city and educational opportunity is in Salt Lake City , some two hours away . <p> On the Net : <p> Directories to distance learning programs : <p> **65;5296;TOOLONG <p> Kentucky Virtual University : http : //www.kcvu.org <p> Western Governors University : http : //www.wgu.edu/wgu <p> University of Nebraska , Family and Consumer Sciences : http : //chrfs.unl.edu/FCS.htm <p> http : //www.triton.cc.il.us <p> http : **26;5363;TOOLONG <p> End Adv for Sunday , Jan. 21 <p>
