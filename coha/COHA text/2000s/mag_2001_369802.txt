Japan 's Finance Minister , KIICHI MIYAZAWA , is regarded as the island of calm in the chaotic sea that passes for Japan 's government . A former Prime Minister , the octogenarian was persuaded to stay on and lend a shred of credibility to an unpopular administration when YOSHIRO MORI came to power last April . So Miyazawa 's unusually frank remarks last week about Japan 's economy carried a particularly powerful punch . The country 's finances , he said , " are near a state of collapse . " The yen quickly slid to 20-month lows . Within days , Mori revealed to government insiders that he intends to step down . <P> Miyazawa was talking specifically about Japan 's budget deficit , expected to reach $5.57 trillion at the end of March , nearly 130% of GDP , the highest proportion in the developed world . That 's just the worst of many problems : stocks are trading at their lowest levels since the 1980s bubble economy popped ; industrial production declined more than 11% in January ; banks are sitting on mountains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deflationary spiral . <P> The government has dithered over what to do , and Miyazawa 's ministry is feuding with the Bank of Japan . More bad news will come this week , with GDP figures expected to show a second consecutive quarter of contraction , putting Japan officially in recession . That 's why Miyazawa 's remarks were welcomed by some . " Finally , an admission that the situation is really severe , " said a government economist . Now if only someone can figure out what to do about it . <P>  --  By Tim Larimer/Tokyo
