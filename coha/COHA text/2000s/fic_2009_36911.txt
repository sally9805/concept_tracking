By the time he was twenty-three , Michael Davenport had learned to trust his own skepticism . He did n't have much patience with myths or legends of any kind , even those that took the form of general assumptions ; what he wanted , always , was to get down to the real story . <br> He had come of age as a waist-gunner on a B-17 , toward the end of the war in Europe , and one of the things he 'd liked least about the Army Air Force was its public-relations program . Everybody thought the Air Force was the luckiest , happiest branch of the service -- better fed and quartered and paid than any other , given more personal freedom , given good clothes to be worn in a " casual " style . Everybody understood , too , that the Air Force could n't be bothered with the petty side of military discipline : Flying and daring and high comradeship were esteemed over any blind respect for rank ; officers and enlisted men could pal around together , if they felt like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thrown-away little mockery of itself in their hands . Soldiers of the ground forces were said to refer to them , enviously , as fly-boys . <br> And all that stuff was probably harmless enough ; it was n't worth getting into any arguments about ; but Michael Davenport would always know that his own Air Force years had been humbling and tedious and bleak , that his times in combat had come close to scaring the life out of him , and that he 'd been enormously glad to get out of the whole lousy business when it was over . <br> Still , he did bring home a few good memories . One was that he had lasted through the semifinals as a middieweight in the boxing tournament at Blanchard Field , Texas -- not many other lawyers ' sons from Morristown , New Jersey , could claim a thing like that . Another , which came to take on philosophical proportions the more he thought about it , was a remark made one sweltering afternoon by some nameless Blanchard Field gunnery instructor in the course of an otherwise boring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mark of a professional in any line of work -- I mean any line of work -- is that he can make difficult things look easy . " <br> And even then , brought awake among the sleepy trainees by that piercing idea , Michael had known for some time what line of work it was that he wanted eventually to make his mark in as a professional : he wanted to write poems and plays . <br> As soon as the Army set him free he went to Harvard , mostly because that was where his father had urged him to apply , and at first he was determined not to be taken in by any of the myths or legends of Harvard , either : he did n't even care to acknowledge , let alone to admire , the physical beauty of the place . It was " school , " a school like any other , and as grimly eager as any other to collect its share of his GI Bill of Rights money . <br> But after a year or two he began to relent a little . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the kind he had always wanted to read ; the other students , some of them , anyway , were turning out to be the kind of men he had always craved as companions . He never wore any of his old Army clothes -- the campus was crawling then with men who did , and who were largely dismissed as " professional veterans "  - -  but he kept the modified handlebar mustache that had been his only affectation in the service , because it still served the purpose of making him look older than his years . And he had to admit , now and then , that he did n't really mind the light that came into people 's eyes , or the quickening of their attention , when they learned he had been an aerial gunner -- or that his playing it down seemed only to make it all the more impressive . He was prepared to believe that Harvard might , after all , provide a good-enough environment for learning how to make difficult things look easy . <br> Then one spring afternoon in his junior year -- all bitterness gone , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lovely Radcliffe girl who could come along at any moment and change your life . <br> " You know so much , " she told him , reaching across a restaurant table to grasp one of his hands with both of her own . " I do n't know any other way to put it . You just -- know so much . " <br> The Radcliffe girl 's name was Lucy Blaine . She had been chosen for the leading role in Michael 's first halfway decent one-act play , which was then in rehearsal at a small campus theater , and this was the first time he had worked up the courage to ask her out . <br> " Every word , " she was saying , " every sound and silence in this play is the work of a man with a profound understanding of the -- you know -- of the human heart . Oh , God , now I 've embarrassed you . " <br> That was true -- he was too embarrassed to meet her eyes -- and he could only hope it would n't make her want to change the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was the first pretty girl who had ever shown so much interest in him , and he knew he could get a lot of mileage out of a mixture like that . <br> When it seemed appropriate to offer a compliment or two of his own he told her how much he 'd enjoyed her performance at the rehearsals . <br> " Oh , no , " she said quickly , and for the first time he noticed she 'd been tearing her paper napkin into careful , resolutely parallel strips on the table . " I mean , thanks , and of course that 's nice to hear , but I know I 'm not really an actress . If I were I 'd have gone to acting school somewhere , and I 'd be knocking myself out in summer stock and trying to get auditions and all that . No " she gathered all the strips of napkin into her fist and gently thumped the table with it for emphasis --  " no , it 's just something I like to do , the way little girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is I could never 've dreamed -- could never 've dreamed I 'd be working in a play like this . " <br> He had already discovered , in walking away from the theater with her , that she was exactly the right size for him -- the top of her head floated just at the edge of his shoulder -- and he knew she was the right age , too : she was twenty ; he would soon be twenty-four . Now , as he took her back to the drab room on Ware Street where he lived alone in " approved student housing , " he wondered if this persistent just-rightness , this pattern of near-perfection , could possibly hold . Would n't there have to be a hitch in it somewhere ? <br> " Well , it 's about like what I imagined , " she said when he 'd shown her into his place , while he made a quick furtive search of the room to be sure there were no dirty socks or underwear in sight . " Sort of stark and simple and a good place to work . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of near-perfection held . When she turned away from him to look out a window --  " And I 'll bet it 's lovely and bright here in the mornings , is n't it ? With these tall windows ? And these trees ? " it seemed entirely natural to move up close behind her , put his arms around her , and take both of her breasts in his hands while he sank his mouth into the side of her neck . <br> In less than a minute they were naked and reveling under the Army blankets of his double bed , and Michael Davenport found he had n't yet known such a fine and responsive girl , had n't even guessed at what a boundless , extraordinary new world a girl could be . <br> " Oh , Jesus , " he said when they were finally at peace , and he wanted to tell her something poetic but did n't know how . " Oh , Jesus , you 're nice , Lucy . " <br> " Well , I 'm glad you think so , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're wonderful . " <br> And it was springtime in Cambridge . Nothing else was of any consequence at all . Even the play had ceased to matter very much : when a Harvard Crimson reviewer called it " sketchy " and described Lucy 's performance as " tentative " they were both able to take it in stride . There would be other plays soon enough ; and besides , everybody knew what envious little snots the Crimson reviewers were . <br> " Ca n't remember if I 've asked you this before , " he said once when they were strolling in the Boston Common , " but what does your father do ? " <br> " Oh , he sort of --  manages things . Different kinds of business things . I 've never quite known what he does , exactly . " <br> And that was the first clue he had , apart from her elegantly simple clothes and manners , that Lucy 's family might be very rich . <br> There were further clues a month or two later , when she took him home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Vineyard . He had never seen anything like it . First you drove to an obscure coastal village called Woods Hole , where you went aboard a surprisingly luxurious ferryboat that floated you out over miles of sea ; then , once ashore again on the distant island of " the Vineyard , " you followed a road between tall uncropped hedges until you came to an almost-hidden driveway that led around among lawns and trees and took you down near the edge of the gentle water , and there was the Blaines ' house -- long and amply proportioned , made almost as much of glass as of wood , with its wooden sections finished in dark brown shingles that looked silver in the dappled sunlight . <br> " I was beginning to think we 'd never get to meet you , Michael , " Lucy 's father said after shaking hands with him . " We 've heard almost nothing but your name since -- well , I suppose it 's only been since April or so , but it seems much longer . " <br> Mr. Blame and his wife were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their daughter 's . They both had the kind of taut , tan skin that comes with easy mastery of swimming and tennis , and their husky voices suggested a full appreciation of daily alcohol . Neither of them looked more than forty-five years old . Seated and smiling together on a long chintz-covered sofa , in their impeccable summer clothes , they might have been a photograph illustrating a magazine article with a title like " Is There an American Aristocracy ? " <br> " Lucy ? " Mrs. Blaine was saying . " Do you think you 'll be able to stay through Sunday ? Or would that mean keeping you away from any number of romantic imperatives back in Cambridge ? " <br> A soft-treading Negro maid came in with a liquor tray , and the early tension of their gathering began to fade . Sitting back to savor the first sip or two of an ice-cold , bone-dry martini , Michael stole an unbelieving glance at the girl of his dreams and then let his gaze follow the lofty ceiling line of one bright wall until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that opened onto other and still other rooms in the shadows of the afternoon . This was a place suggesting the timeless repose that only several generations ' worth of success could provide . This was class . <br> " Well , but what do you mean , ' class ' ? " Lucy asked him , with an exasperated little puckering of her forehead , as they walked alone along the narrow beach the next day . " When you use a word like that it makes you sound sort of proletarian and dumb , or something , and you must know I know better than that . " <br> " Well , compared to you I am proletarian . " <br> " Oh , that 's silly , " she said . " That 's the silliest thing I 've ever heard you say . " <br> " Okay , but listen : Do you think we might get out of here tonight ? Instead of staying through Sunday ? " <br> " Well , I suppose so , sure . But why ? " <br> " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so that his fingers could touch one of her nipples , very tenderly , through the fabric of her shirt . " Because there are any number of romantic imperatives back in Cambridge . " <br> His own most important romantic imperative , all through the fall and winter of that year , was to find attractive ways of fending off her shy but persistent wish to be married . <br> " Well , of course I want to , " he would say . " You know that . I want to as much as you do , or even more . I just do n't think it 'd be too smart a thing to do before I 've even gotten started in any kind of work . Is n't that reasonable ? " <br> And she would seem to agree , but he learned soon enough that words like " reasonable " did n't carry much weight with Lucy Blaine . <br> A wedding date was set for the week after his graduation . His family came up from Morristown to smile in courteous bewilderment through the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully aware of how it had all come about . When their taxicab brought them from the church to the reception , in an old stone building at the base of Beacon Hill , he and Lucy emerged under the looming figure of a mounted policeman who raised one hand to the visor of his cap in a formal salute as his beautifully groomed horse stood straight and still as a statue at the curbside . <br> " Jesus , " Michael said as they started up an elegant flight of stairs . " How much do you suppose it costs to hire a mounted cop for a wedding reception ? " <br> " Oh , I do n't know , " she said impatiently . " Not much , I should n't think . Fifty ? " <br> " Got ta be a lot more than fifty , honey , " he told her , " if only because you 'd have to buy oats for the horse . " And she laughed and hugged his arm to show she knew he was only fooling . <br> A small orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three or four big , open rooms of the reception , and crouching bartenders raced under the pressure of their orders . Michael spotted his parents once in the sea of guests and was glad to find they had a sufficient number of strangers to talk to , and that their Morristown clothes looked all right , but then he lost sight of them again . A very old , wheezing man , wearing the silk rosette of some rare honor in the lapel of his custom-made suit , was trying to explain that he 'd known Lucy since she was a baby -- in her pram ! In her little woolly mittens and her booties ! "  - -  and another man , much younger , with a knuckle-crushing handshake , wanted to know how Michael felt about sinking-fund debentures . There were three girls who had known Lucy " at Farmington " and who rushed with squeals of happiness to embrace her , though she could scarcely wait until they were gone to tell Michael that she hated them all , and there were women of her mother 's age who dabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely bride . It was while pretending to listen to the drink-fuddled talk of a man who played squash with Lucy 's father that Michael thought again of the mounted policeman at the curb . Surely it would n't be possible to " hire " a cop and his horse ; they could have been stationed here only through the courtesy of the police department , or of the mayor , and that suggested an element of " influence " in Lucy 's family as well as of money . <br> Continues ...
