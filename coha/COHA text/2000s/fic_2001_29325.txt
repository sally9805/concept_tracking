Friday , August 18 For Mom the move from Texas to Florida was a military operation , like the many moves she had made as a child . We had our orders . We had our supplies . We had a timetable . If it had been necessary to do so , we would have driven the eight hundred miles from our old house to our new house straight through , without stopping at all . We would have refueled the Volvo while hurtling along at seventy-five miles per hour next to a moving convoy-refueling truck . Fortunately this was n't necessary . Mom had calculated that we could leave at 6:00 A.M. central daylight time , stop three times at twenty minutes per stop , and still arrive at our destination at 9:00 P.M. eastern daylight time . I guess that 's challenging if you 're the driver . It 's pretty boring if you 're just sitting there , so I slept on and off until , in the early evening , we turned off Interstate 10 somewhere in western Florida . This scenery was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window , fascinated by it . We passed mile after mile of green fields overflowing with tomatoes and onions and watermelons . I suddenly had this crazy feeling like I wanted to bolt from the car and run through the fields until I could n't run anymore . I said to Mom , " This is Florida ? This is what it looks like ? " Mom laughed . " Yeah . What did you think it looked like ? " " I do n't know . A beach with a fifty-story condo on it . " " Well , it looks like that , too . Florida 's a huge place . We 'll be living in an area that 's more like this one . There are still a lot of farms around . " " What do they grow ? I bet they grow tangerines . " " No . Not too many . Not anymore . This is too far north for citrus trees . Every few years they get a deep freeze that wipes them all out . Most of the citrus growers here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah ? And what do the developers do with it ? " " Well . . . they develop it . They plan communities with nice houses , and schools , and industrial parks . They create jobs --  construction jobs , teaching jobs , civil engineering jobs --  like your father 's . " But once we got farther south and crossed into Tangerine County , we did start to see groves of citrus trees , and they were an amazing sight . They were perfect . Thousands upon thousands of trees in the red glow of sundown , perfectly shaped and perfectly aligned , vertically and horizontally , like squares in a million-square grid . Mom pointed . " Look . Here comes the first industrial park . " I looked up ahead and saw the highway curve off , left and right , into spiral exit ramps , like rams ' horns . Low white buildings with black windows stretched out in both directions . They were all identical . Mom said , " There 's our exit . Right up there . " I looked ahead another quarter mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see much else . A fine brown dust was now blowing across the highway , drifting like snow against the shoulders and swirling up into the air . We turned off Route 27 , spiraled around the rams ' horns , and headed east . Suddenly the fine brown dirt became mixed with thick black smoke . Mom said , " Good heavens ! Look at that . " I looked to where she was pointing , up to the left , out in a field , and my heart sank . The black smoke was pouring from a huge bonfire of trees . Citrus trees . I said , " Why are they doing that ? Why are they just burning them up ? " " To clear the land . " " Well , why do n't they build houses out of them ? Or homeless shelters ? Or something ? " Mom shook her head . " I do n't think they can build with them . I do n't think those trees have any use other than for fruit . " She smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid grapefruit , do you ? " I did n't smile back . Mom pointed to the right and said , " There 's another one . " Sure enough . Same size ; same flames licking up the sides ; same smoke billowing out . It was like a Texas football bonfire , but nobody was dancing around it , and nobody was celebrating anything . Then , in an instant , in the blink of an eye , we crossed over from this wasteland into a place carpeted with green grass , with trees along both sides of the road and flower beds running down the middle of a median strip . We could see the roofs of big , expensive houses peeking up over the landscaping . Mom said , " This is where the developments begin . This one is called the Manors of Coventry . Are n't they beautiful ? Ours is a little farther in . " We went past the Villas at Versailles , which , if anything , looked even more expensive . Then we saw a high gray wall and a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We passed iron gates and a pond of some kind . Then we made a couple of turns and pulled into a wide driveway . Mom announced , " This is it . This is our house . " It was big --  two stories high --  and very white , with aqua trim , like a Miami Dolphins football helmet . A new wooden fence ran around both sides to the back , where it met up with that high gray wall . The wall , apparently , surrounded the entire development . The garage door opened up with a smooth mechanical hum . Dad was standing in there with his arms open . He called out , " Perfect timing , you two . The pizzas got here five minutes ago . " Mom and I climbed out of the car , stiff and hungry . Dad came outside , clicking the garage door closed . He put an arm around each of us and guided us toward the front , saying , " Let 's do this the right way . Huh ? Let 's go in the visitors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a tiled foyer two stories high . We turned to the left and passed through an enormous great room with furniture and boxes piled all around it . We ended up in an area off the kitchen that had a small , round table and four chairs . Erik was sitting in one of the chairs . He waved casually to Mom . He ignored me . Mom waved back at him , but she was looking at the boxes stacked in the kitchen . She said to Dad , " These boxes are marked DINING ROOM . " Dad said , " Uh-huh . " " Uh-huh . Well , I marked DINING ROOM on them so the movers would put them in the dining room . " " OK . Erik 'll put them over there . " He looked at me and added , " Erik and Paul . " Mom asked , " Did the movers break anything ? " " No . They did n't break a thing . They were real pros . Nice guys , too . " Mom and I each grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a slice , and started stuffing it into his mouth . Mom said , " How about waiting for the rest of us , Erik ? " He gave her a tomatoey grin . Dad passed out paper plates , napkins , and cans of soda .
