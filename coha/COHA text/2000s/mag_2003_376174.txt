It seems that anywhere you turn these days , people are wearing pedometers  --  you know , those little pagerlike devices that attach to your waistband and count the number of steps you take ? The American Diabetes Association has packaged one with its new book on the benefits of physical activity , Small Steps , Big Rewards , and McDonald 's is offering a free one with its new Happy Meal for adults , which is being test-marketed in Indiana . <P> How many steps should you rack up ? The figure you see most often is 10,000 a day . That 's a nice , round number , based on Japanese research showing that it improves fitness . But like so many one-size-fits-all solutions , those 10,000 steps may not all be necessary . " The number 10,000 has developed almost mythical proportions , " says Gregory Welk , a physical-activity researcher at Iowa State University in Ames . " It 's actually not yet clear at what point you start getting a benefit . " In fact , if all you want is to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than your normal routine  --  provided you also pay attention to what you eat . <P> At least that is the contention of James Hill , an obesity researcher at the University of Colorado in Denver . The average American office worker takes about 5,000 steps a day , Hill says . Trying to double that right away may be too much too fast . He calculates that taking an extra 2,000 steps while eating 100 fewer calories a day is enough to keep most people from gaining the typical pound or two a year that comes with middle-age spread . But Hill does concede that 10,000 steps may be necessary to control Type 2 diabetes or to lose weight and keep it off . <P> Ready to strap on a pedometer and give it a try ? A good model will set you back anywhere from $10 to $25 . The brand used most often in research is the Digi-Walker by Yamax , but you do n't need all the fancy mileage and calorie-counter features ( those measures are guesstimates at best ) . A no-frills pedometer is quite accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up America ! You 'll get the best results if you keep the pedometer in line with what would be the crease line on a pair of trousers . But watch out : pedometers tend to overestimate how much exercise you get while cleaning the house . And it 's not fair to shake it to make the counter move !
