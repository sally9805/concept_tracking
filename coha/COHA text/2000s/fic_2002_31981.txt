" Drive hard , Joe . Mary Ann 's blue again , so I want to be home by ten . " This from the boss , Will . Will Trona , Orange County Supervisor , First District . Mary Ann is his wife . " Yes , sir . " " Talk while you drive . Are you carrying ? " " The usual . " Will was on edge again . Lots of that lately . He sat down beside me like he usually did . Never in the backseat unless he was in conference . Only in the front , where he could watch the road and the gauges and me . He loved speed . Loved coming out of a turn with his head thrown back against the rest . He 'd always ask me how I did it , go that fast into a turn and keep the car on the road . And I always gave him the same answer : " Slow in , fast out , " which is the first thing they teach you about curves in any driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think are impossible . We headed down from Will 's home in the Tustin hills . It was evening in the middle of June , the sun hanging in a pink haze of clouds and smog . Lots of new mansions up there , but Will 's house was n't one of them . Supervisors make a decent salary , plus some perks . Orange County is one of the most expensive places in the country . Will 's place was a tear down by the new standards of the neighborhood . Just old and plain , nothing wrong with it besides that . In fact , it was a good house . More than good . I know because I grew up in it . Will 's my father , kind of . " First stop is the Front , " he said , checking his watch . " Medina 's finally peeking out the windows again . " He talked without looking at me . Leaned back his head , eyelidshalf down , but his eyes moving . He usually looked like he was disappointed with what he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to make it better . But there was also something affectionate in his expression . Pride of ownership . Will reached down between his feet and snapped open his leather briefcase . He took out the black calendar , set the briefcase back on the floorboard , then started scribbling with a pen . He liked to talk while he wrote . Sometimes it was to himself , and sometimes it was to me . Growing up with him since I was five , working nights for him since I was sixteen , I 've come to know when he 's was talking to me or talking to himself . " Medina 's getting a second chance . He registers five hundred illegal aliens to vote , they tell a Times reporter that they 're illegals , but they 're allowed to vote in a United States election . Allowed to , because Medina told them they could . And they all voted for me , because Medina told them to . Now , what am I supposed to do with that ? " I 'd already thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Distance yourself . Five hundred votes is n't worth the scandal . " " That 's shortsighted , Joe . Mean spirited and stupid is what it is . I get the whole Latino vote thanks to Medina , and you think I should toss him overboard ? Who taught you to treat your friends like that ? " Will 's always teaching . Testing . Revising . Arguing it out . Saying things to see how they sound , to see if he believes them or not . I 've learned to see some things Will 's way . Other things I 'll never learn . Will Trona made me what I am , but even Will can only do so much . I 'm less than half his age . I 've got a long way to go . But one thing Will taught me is to make up your mind fast and put the whole weight of your being behind that decision . Instantly . Later , if you have to change your mind , put all your weight behind that decision . Never be afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stubbornness . So I said , " You need the Latino vote to carry the First District , sir . You know that . And those votes wo n't go away . They love you . " Will shook his head and wrote again . He 's a handsome man , good build , strong in the neck and deep in the chest , with hands that got strong and dark working summers in construction , helping himself through school after Vietnam . Black hair combed back , gray on the sides , blue eyes . When he looks at you it 's the same expression he gets in the car , head back a little , almost sleepy , but the eyes are alert . And if he smiles , the lines of his fifty four years frame it in a way that convinces people that he knows and likes them . Most of the time , he does . " Joe , pay attention to Medina tonight . Mouth shut , eyes open . You might actually learn something . " Mouth shut , eyes open . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons . He closed the calendar and slid it back into the briefcase . Clicked it shut . Looked at his watch again . Then he leaned against the headrest and lowered his eyelids halfway and watched the white middle-class boulevard of Tustin become the barrio of Santa Ana . " How was work today ? " " Quiet , sir . " " It 's always quiet in there . Until there 's a fight or a race riot . " " Yes . " By day , I 'm a deputy for the Orange County Sheriff 's Department . I work the Central Jail Complex , as do all new deputies . I 've worked the jail four years now . Another year , I 'll qualify for reassignment to patrol and start becoming a real cop . I 'm twenty-four years old . I became a deputy because Will told me to . That 's what he was , until he got elected supervisor . Will told me to become a deputy because he thought it would be good for me , and because he thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son " in the sheriff 's department . Down on Fourth Street , not far from the jail where I work , there 's the Hispanic American Cultural Front . It 's Jaime Medina 's outfit . HACF does good things distributes money and goods to the Hispanic poor , offers scholarships and stipends for needy students , expedites immigration , shelters families in crisis , all that . But because of this misunderstanding about when Medina 's almost-citizens could vote , the DA is considering closing down the place on charges of conspiracy and election fraud . They raided the HACF building last week for records . Front page picture of guys in suits lugging cardboard boxes to a van . Will should n't have been going there , with an investigation pending . And he 's good friends with the DA , Philip Dent one more reason to keep his nose clean while the investigation played out . But Will also represents Medina 's district on the Board of Supervisors , a district you ca n't win without the Hispanic vote and Hispanic dollars . Another political pinch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooner or later he 'll have to take a stand , because , as Will taught me early on , politics is action . " Joe , Jennifer is going to have something for us . While I 'm talking to Jaime , put it in the trunk and lock it . " " Yes , sir . " I turned left off the boulevard , checking the mirrors again , looking out at the Zapateria on one corner , the bridal store on the other with all the white-laced mannequins in the window . I studied the cars behind us , the people on the sidewalk . I was a little nervy myself that evening . Something in the air ? Maybe . Maybe nothing that obvious . Even with the windows up and the air conditioner blowing you could hear the Mexican music jumping from the Discoteca . A polka on mescaline . A dark-faced man in a white cowboy hat and boots stopped at the curb to let us turn , maybe recognizing Will Trona 's car , maybe not , his face a walnut deadpan that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then into a dirt parking lot in the shade of a huge pepper tree , facing the back door of the HACF headquarters . We stepped into the pleasant heat and Will , dressed in his usual trim dark suit and carrying his leather briefcase , led the way in . The back doors were locked so Will rapped hard . " Open up , Jaime ! La Migra ! " The door cracked open , then swung all the way . " As usual , you 're not funny , " said Jaime . He was a slender young man with stooped shoulders , tortoiseshell eyeglasses and khaki trousers that looked two sizes too big . " The racists raid me and you run away . " " So now I 'm back . Let 's do business . I 'm in a hurry . " Medina turned and walked down the hall , Will following , then me . They went into the office and Jaime shut the door behind them , acknowledging me for the first time with a hurried nod as the door shut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a face like mine , you do n't want people paying attention to you . One of the first things Will taught me was that people were far less eager to gawk at me than I thought they were . He said that most people were afraid to even look . He was right . That was nineteen years ago , when he first took me into his home . I went down the hall , through a set of saloon doors and checked the work room . There were six stations : desk , phone , stacks of papers , and three chairs at each for clients . American flag on one wall , Mexican one on the other , travel posters , soccer posters , bullfight posters . Quiet . No clients since the raid . No workers since the raid , except Jennifer , the assistant director under Jaime . " Good evening , Miss Avila . " I took off my hat . " Mr. Trona . Good evening . " She came over , offered her hand and I shook it . She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . Wearing a man 's white cotton shirt tucked into her jeans , small waist , nice straight shoulders , black boots . She changed to an apple red lipstick a few months back , after a year of cinnamon brown . " Will must be here . " " They 're in Jaime 's office . " She looked past me down the hall , just a reflexive glance , then walked back to her desk . Jennifer is taken with the boss . This is one of the many secrets I 'm not supposed to know . The world is layered with them . She said , " That thing for you is over by my chair . " " I 'll get it , thank you . " It was a U.S. Open tennis bag , a big black one with a blazing yellow ball on it . Heavy . I carried it back out to the car and set it on the asphalt while I disarmed the alarm and opened the trunk . Then I set it in and spread a blanket over it , locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a magazine from the lobby , then rolled a chair into the hallway and sat outside Jaime Medina 's office . Medina : You 've got to talk to Phil Dent , man . . . . Will : I know him , Jaime . I do n't own him . Medina : Right . . . that 's not your job , my . . . friend . . . . Jennifer walked past me , fresh with scent , and leaned into the office without knocking . " Coffee , beer ? Hi , Will . " " Coffee , please . " She whisked by me without a look , then back again a minute later with a couple of mugs in one hand and a carton of milk in the other . She went into the office . Will muttered something and all three laughed . She came out and shut the door and looked at me like I 'd just gotten there . " Anything for you , Mr. Trona ? " " Nothing , thank you . I 'm fine . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the magazine across my knee but did n't look at it . My job is to watch and listen , not read . Mouth shut , eyes open . I heard the traffic on the boulevard . I heard the air conditioner hum . I heard a car go by with a subwoofer that you could feel in your chest . I still felt a little wrong about things , but I did n't know why . Maybe it was just Will 's mood rubbing off on me . I often catch myself adopting his feelings . Maybe because he adopted me as his son . I heard Jennifer dialing a telephone . Medina : There 's all that tobacco settlement money , man . . . like a billion plus you 're Will : That billion is n't mine , it 's the county 's , Jaime . I ca n't hand it over in a pillowcase . Did n't the ninety help ? Jennifer:Get Pearlita . Medina : Every bit helps . But what am I going to do when it 's gone ? Sit and watch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for operations , Will . We need it for job training , for lawyers , for food , man , we need it for . . . Jennifer : Okay , okay . Yeah , he 's here right now . Medina : . . . we ca n't even do anything when some poor pregnant Latina gets run over and killed a block from her apartment . We ca n't do anything when a Guatemalan kid gets shot to death by fascist Newport Beach cops . We 're handcuffed , man , dead in the water . Will : It 's awful what happened , Jaime . I know it is . Medina : Then help us find a way to help them , Will . I heard Jennifer put the phone back in its cradle . She turned my way but I did n't look up from the magazine . Will : You helped me find Savannah , so maybe Jack will take care of you . And the Reverend will put in a good word for you and the Front . I have already . Medina : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened . Medina , face pinched , led us down the hall and shook hands with both of us at the back door . Jennifer walked us outside , left the door open behind her . Will gave me a nod . I went to the car , started the engine and hit the air conditioner . I could see them in the side mirror , Will in his dark suit and Jennifer in her jeans and boots and crisp white shirt , standing in the light of the open door . They talked for a while . Will set his briefcase on the asphalt . Then he shook her hand like Will 's shaken a million hands : an open-palmed reach and clinch , the left hand coming forward to enclose yours while he leans his head back in a posture of welcome and possession as he smiles at you . " I love you , " she said . I could n't hear anything over the air conditioner , but it was easy to read her apple red lips . Will reached into his pocket and handed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , about the size of a half smoked Churchill : just a couple of grand to help out some of her friends . " I love you , " he said back . We drove out of Santa Ana and into Tustin . Will directed me to Tustin High School , had me pull up alongside the tennis courts . Not much tennis action by then , just two of the courts being used . " Joe , fetch that tennis bag out of the trunk and take it over to the middle court . Leave it on the bench . " " Yes , sir . " When I got back we sat in silence for a minute or two . Will checked his watch . " What 's in the bag , Dad ? " " Silence . " " Is that an answer or an order , sir ? " " Reverend Daniel at the Grove , " he said . The Grove Club is never called the Grove Club by its members , just the Grove . It 's hidden in the south county hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding private drive and past a gate staffed by two armed guards , usually moonlighting deputies . You ca n't see the Grove from any public road . A canopy of enormous palm , sycamore and eucalyptus trees obscures aerial views . It has never been pictured in a newspaper or on the TV news . I took the first few miles of the 241 at ninety miles an hour . The electronic marquee said " Take the Toll Road Because Life is Too Short ! " The marquee was the only light out there in miles and miles of dark hills . Just a couple other cars in sight . Politically , Will fought all four of the toll roads because although the public has to repair them , maintain them , and pay exorbitantly high tolls to drive on them they 're privately owned . The profits go into the pockets of the Toll Roads Agency . TRA sounds like a public outfit , but it 's not it 's a consortium of extremely wealthy developers who are raising buildings along the toll roads before the asphalt is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a city go up overnight . There 's more to the story . The TRA guys got the State Assembly to stop maintaining certain state highways in Orange County . The highways go unrepaired and unimproved through the year 2006 , which guarantees customers for the toll roads because the unrepaired highways are dangerous and clotted with traffic six hours a day . Anyway , Will lost that battle but was half glad that he did , because you can drive seriously fast on the spanking new toll roads . We use them all the time , due to Will 's hatred of traffic and love of speed . Once I got past the first toll plaza I opened her up past one twenty and Will leaned over to get a good look at the speedometer , then sat back . He chuckled . " Yeah , Joe . " Six months ago Will and his fellow supervisors voted themselves a car allowance increase of two hundred percent , which allowed him to lease a BMW 750IL . The stock engine gets 330 horsepower out of 12 cylinders . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes up at sixty , stable at 160 mph , corners beautifully for a big sedan . Off the line it 's not going to blow your hair back a Saleen Cobra clobbered me at a traffic light last week . " Ah , " he said quietly . " This feels good . " I pushed the throttle through the kick-down switch and the car hesitated for a fraction of a second , then barreled up to one-thirty-five , then one-forty . This model was built with a kill switch at 155 mph , but Will had me install a Dinan Chip to override the governor . The chip also brought the horsepower up to 370 . Will likes to listen to the muffled shriek of that engine under full acceleration , and so do I. When the German horses are running hard , nothing beats them for an honest ride . " Son , sometimes I wish this road was ten thousand miles long . We could just drive for hours . Away from the Grub . I loathe the Grub . " Grub , for Grove Club Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " I said . Even though he loathes the Grub , the boss is a member because he needs to be a member . As a man who is n't afraid to piss on the flames of free enterprise for the occasional good of the county , Will Trona is not Grove material . But as a politician who votes himself a stupidly expensive car to be driven at criminal speeds on semi-work-related business , he becomes Grove material . Obviously , as the supervisor of the powerful first district , he helps run the government , and the government can influence the business interests that dominate the Grove , so the Grove needs Will , too . Will told me he pays two grand a month membership dues , all of which is covered by patrons . Dues for public servants are " nominal " because no honest one can afford the usual costs of membership . Most of the money goes into the Grove Trust , then into its Research &; Action Committee , a nonprofit 527 Organization that operates free of both the FEC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undisclosed millions for the causes and lobbies it thinks are vital to its interests . Its interests are profit and power . But they 're interested in more than those things , too . Last year , for instance , the Grove Trust donated $60,000 to the Hillview Home for Children . That 's enough for two mid-level salaried positions , for one year . I think highly of Hillview , and the struggle they go through for money . Hillview was where I spent most of the first five years of my life . Two off-duty deputies logged us in and raised the gate . The Grove sat one mile in , tucked in a valley between the hills . It 's an enclosed hacienda style building , built around a large courtyard . The rounded archways of the colonnades are brick and adobe , wrapped by purple bougainvillea . The courtyard gardens and fountain are illuminated by recessed lights , and they glow from a distance like an emerald wrapped in tissue . The building itself is kept mostly dark on the outside . I parked the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop wrote our names onto his sheet . He was about to ask me my name when I tipped back my hat to let him see who I was . I have notoriety because of this face . It 's unmistakable . What happened to it was a big story when I was a baby . Will led the way into the dining room , shook a few hands . I stood back , folding mine in front of me . An average night at the Grub : half the tables were couples , mostly older , lots of gray hair and diamonds set off by dinner jackets and dresses . Three major developers one commercial and two residential . A building industry lobbyist who had formerly served as supervisor . Two assemblymen , a state senator , the lieutenant governor 's top aid . A four top of venture capitalists . A table of thirty something guys made billionaires by the NASDAQ . We went up the stairs to the lounge , which is a large room with an island bar , billiards tables and booths around the perimeter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and racked the table nearest the booth , where I could entertain myself and eavesdrop without making Will 's guests nervous . I glanced up at the third floor . I could see the wide burnished staircase and the closed door to one of the hospitality suites . A waiter knocked . Hush hush stuff , up in those suites . Rich men and their dull secrets . I 've spent time in all of them . I got a good break , watched three balls clunk into their pockets . The Reverend Daniel Alter , dapper and gray haired , arrived exactly on time . He touched my arm on his way by , but did n't say anything . I watched him shake hands with Will , slide into the booth across from him , then draw the privacy curtain . The Reverend Daniel runs an enormous " television ministry . " The broadcasts originate in his multimillion-dollar " Chapel of Light " here in Orange County , and they go worldwide . You 've probably seen him on TV . Daniel 's sermons are upbeat and optimistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspirational videos to Chapel of Light keychains that really light up . The money that floods in is tax free and no one knows where it goes , not even Will Trona . That 's what he tells me , anyway . Reverend Daniel : Here 's this . Will : Good-good . Reverend Daniel : The bullpen is killing us . Will : Then score more runs . I got the bag from Jaime . Reverend Daniel : Do you have her ? Will : I know where she is . But I 'm not so sure I trust those people with her . Reverend Daniel : What could you mean by that ? Will : We 'll see what . Reverend Daniel : You 've done a wonderful thing , Will . And Jack 's done his part . It 's all going to work out . A long pause then , while I banked the two ball across the felt and into a corner pocket . Reverend Daniel : I 'm counting on you . Let God work this miracle for me through you . Will : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles for you , Daniel . You 've gotten about a thousand too many as it is . Reverend Daniel : Do n't be pissy , Will . I thought this was your kind of thing . Is everything set ? Will : It 's been arranged , Dan . Do n't worry . Reverend Daniel : You know , Will , the Lord really does work in mysterious ways . Then the Reverend Daniel slid back the curtain and they both stepped out . Daniel glanced at the table , then looked at me with his half smile . " I 'd recommend the six , " he said . " With plenty of follow . " Will clapped him on the shoulder and Reverend Daniel headed for the bar . Will checked his watch . " Let 's go , Joe . We 're picking up a package , making a delivery , then calling it quits . It 's been a ball-buster of a day . " As we left the lounge , the Reverend sat at the bar next to a woman with shiny black hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night cooled , big swirls puffing in from the Pacific . Par for June . Down at the coast they call it June Gloom . When we got out of the hills and back into cell range , Will 's phone went off . He said , " Trona , " then he listened a moment . " You got her , right ? " Listened again , then flipped the phone shut . " Joe , we 've got a package at seven thirty-three Lind Street , Anaheim . Flog this pompous piece of tin and get us over there . Boy , I 'll be glad when this day 's over . " " Yes , sir . " I checked the mirrors , hit a hundred in less than ten seconds . " What 's in this package , boss ? " " We 're trying to do a good deed . " When we hit the Tustin city limits Will 's phone rang again . He answered and listened . Then he said , " Things are lining up . I 'll do what I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond . " He flipped the phone shut , sighed . We were almost into Anaheim when he dialed out . " Looks like we 'll be there on time , " was all he said . It was an apartment backing an alley in the ugly part of Anaheim . Will told me to park in the alley . It was so narrow another car could n't get by unless we moved . There was a row of carports to our left , and to our right a cinder-block wall wild with graffiti . Not a creature stirring , just the fog easing along . " Be unfriendly , " he said . Which is what he said if he thought there could be trouble , or if he just wanted me to intimidate people . Will stood behind me as I knocked with my left hand , my right up under my coat lapel on the grip of one of the two forty-five Automatic Colt Pistols I usually carry . " Yes ? Who is it ? " " Open the door , " I said . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she saw my face , then her eyes opened wider . I pushed past her and stepped inside . Her hands were empty and there was no movement behind her , just the sound of a TV . She looked at my face , then I gave her a look at what was under my coat . Her eyes moved from the gun to my face , then back again . Trapped between two horror shows . She raised her hands slowly , deciding to look at the floor . The apartment smelled of bacon and cigarettes . Bedsheets for curtains , carpet worn to the padding , padding worn to the plywood . " I don ' know anything about this , mister . They say come and watch a girl , I come and watch a girl . I don ' know " Will , then : " Be calm , seora . She 's okay , son . Where are they ? " She nodded toward the bedroom . " She here . He no here . Watching television . " " Stay put , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss ? " " Go get her . " The girl stood up from the floor when I walked in . She was small , blonde , pale . Blue jeans and a Cirque de Soleil T-shirt , white sneakers . Twelve years old , maybe . She studied my face . Children will do that sometimes , just stare . Often , they 'll make a face , sometimes cry . Sometimes they run . I saw her eyes go afraid and her chin tremble . " I 'm Joe . " " I 'm Savannah , " she said very quietly . Then she stepped forward and offered her small , quivering hand . I shook it . I pulled the brim of my hat down a little more , to help her . " How do you do ? " she asked . " I 'm not sure . Please come with me , though . " She slung a Pocahontas backpack over one shoulder and led the way out . Going back down the stairs to the alley , I held my hand over the handle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened the passenger-side doors for them and waited while Will took her backpack off , strapped her in , adjusted the shoulder restraint for her small frame , showed her how the armrests tilted out of the seat back . Of all the things that he is husband , politician , agitator , manipulator , dreamer I can forget that he is a father , too . An adoptive father , maybe the most generous fathers of all . He had his hand on her shoulder , talking quietly , one foot dangling out the open door . Headlights swerved toward us and I heard a car engine down the alley in front of me . No hurry , no threat , probably a renter heading for his carport . " Sir , let 's get going . " " I 'm talking . " I heard another car coming up from behind , saw the headlight beams crawl up the shiny black trunk of the BMW . I moved closer to the open rear door . " You should get in the car , Boss . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ahead . Coming the same speed , no hurry , no brights . No problem ? Then both cars stopped . Eighty feet ahead , eighty feet behind . They vanished in a blanket of moving fog , then appeared again . I could n't tell makes or models , had no chance at all on the plates . " Possible trouble , sir . " " Where ? " " Everywhere . " I kicked Will 's dangling foot in and slammed the door , got the remote pad out of my pocket . Car doors opening . The shuffle of feet on asphalt . In the fog-dulled wash of the headlights in front of me I saw three figures moving , growing larger . One tall , two shorter . Long coats , collars up , faces hard to see . I threw open my door and pulled on the headlights , slammed the door closed behind me and locked everything with the remote . I put my right hand under my jacket and on the butt of one forty-five . I turned and looked behind : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . I put my left hand on the other ACP , which left me crossing my chest with both hands , like I was cold . Then a deep , resonant voice from ahead , bouncing off the alley wall and the garages , hard to locate but easy to hear . " Will ! Ah , Will Trona ! Let 's talk . " Will was out of the car before I could stop him . " Watch Savannah , " he said . " I 'll get rid of this dingleberry . " I shut the door on her and stepped after him , but he reeled and hissed straight into my face . " I said watch the girl , Joe ! So watch the girl ! " I stayed back with her but I watched him walk away , blanched white in the cross-fire of the headlight beams . The Tall One stepped forward . I could n't see much of his face : could n't even guess an age . His hands were in his coat pockets . The two guys behind me had shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , automatic weapons held close up to their coats , barrels down . They did n't move . They had us and I knew it and there was n't one thing I could do right then except stand there and watch . Will stopped about six feet short of the guy , put his hands on his hips and spread his feet a little . Words floated back with the engine noise and exhaust . I unlocked the car doors with the remote , reached in and killed the interior lights . " What 's going on , Joe ? " asked the girl . " I ca n't see . " " Say nothing . Absolutely nothing . " " Okay . " . . . hard man to catch up with , Will Trona . . . . " There was a strange cadence to the voice , an almost cheerful lilt to the syllables . Just a little off , like a second language learned later in life . Will : " Who the hell are you ? " " . . . the girl in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're with Alex . " Laughter . " Little shit too scared to show his face , ah ? " Then Will again : " We had a deal . Get the hell out of here . " " Now the deal is this . " The Tall One leaned forward and a sharp explosion cracked through the alley . Will dropped to his knees and bent over . I yanked open the rear door , jumped in , unbuckled Savannah and shoved her all the way across the seat . Looking through the windshield I saw The Tall One step forward . I pushed open the far door , climbed around Savannah , dragged her out of the car by one arm . " What 's happening ? Is Will okay ? " " Shhh . " Pulling on the girl , I turned to see the shining end of the Tall One 's hand pointed down at Will . Another hard crack , Will 's head jerking once , smoke rising up against the fog and into the glare of the headlights . " Savannah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two honks is me . Two honks is me . " I picked her up and dangled her over the cinder-block wall , then let go . I heard her land , then fast footsteps . The footsteps of the men behind me got louder . I dropped to the pavement , drew one weapon and slid back into the rear seat of the dark car . The two behind me came fast , machine guns up . They were looking at the wall , where they 'd last seen me . When they got close enough I shot them both . The left one fell hard . The right one shuddered and stopped and unleashed a wild automatic burst that jerked the firing gun back into his own face . Then a clatter and a groan . Staying low , I backed out and spilled again onto the pavement . On elbows and knees I wriggled to the front of the car , pressing in close to the body panel , gun out ahead of me . Even in the headlights I only saw shapes : the Tall One , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground . Distance off . Perspective off . Everything a pale haze . Shit , what was that ? The deep voice again : Go see . I pointed my .45 toward the voices , watched the fog beyond the sights . I think there 's two down , over by the car . Go see ! I inched the sights to my left , tracking the voice . Then footsteps came at me , two sets , close together . Shapes coalescing in the headlights . I ca n't see a goddamned thing ! The footsteps stopped . Shit . . . it 's Nix and Luke . Wasted , man . I 'm not going in there . . . . The fog blew open , then closed again . Strange looking men . I heard the Tall One behind them , and his clear voice cutting through the fog . Get back here . Now ! Move ! The sound of men running , shapes illuminated in the wash of headlights . Tall One : Get over here . Nix and Luke are dead over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks , and two muffled thuds . Then two more shots , as twin orange comets flashed down from the Tall One 's hand . A moment later the car reversed with a chirp of rubber and jumped backwards , the bright slash of the headlights sweeping the asphalt . I saw the two men down beyond Will , one of them moving , one not . When the car backed out of the alley and roared down the street on the other side of the cinder blocks I ran . Will was huddled on his knees , forehead to the ground , arms around his middle . Blood on his head and his clothes and the asphalt . I put my hand on his back . " Oops , " he whispered . " Quiet , Boss . You 're all right . " I ran back to the car and brought it forward . I got Will into the passenger seat . He sat up okay . Wet and heavy . Smell of metal . Blood on my face where his head had rested when I dragged him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot was still moving as I guided the big car around him . I tore out to Lincoln Boulevard running the late-night signals , my palm slick on the horn , clumps of fog tearing past the windows . " You 're okay , Will . You 're going to be okay . " His head was back on the rest and his eyes were open to the headliner . A dull light in those eyes . Shoulder and shirt and lap full of blood . " Hang on , Dad . Please hang on . We 're almost there . " " Mary Ann . " I hit a hundred southbound . The cars seemed to rocket backwards at us . Will 's head rattled when I shot across the lane dividers . Then he leaned forward like he always did , to watch the gauges and me . " Everyone . " " Everyone what , Dad ? " He coughed a red mess onto the windshield and hung forward against his shoulder strap . Taillights rushed by . I fishtailed down the Chapman off-ramp , ran three reds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoking to a stop on the ambulance ramp . Will was slumped against the door . When I ran around and opened the door he fell into my arms and I carried him up the ramp , understanding that he did n't need a doctor . I slipped to my knees but kept him balanced because it was the only thing I could do for him and I wanted to do it well . Two ER guys were running a gurney down toward us . Hell is waiting . I paced the emergency waiting room and the walkways outside , making the calls that needed to be made first to my mother , Mary Ann , then to brothers Junior and Glenn . Those were the hardest calls I 'd made in my life , no contest . I could n't tell them that Will was going to die . I could n't tell them he was going to live . I blubbered only that he 'd been shot , choking out the words . I drove the car off the emergency ramp and parked it in the lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather and the ugly stink of human panic . Twenty minutes later , an emergency room doctor told me that we had lost Will . Lost . That word was a bullet through my heart . It told me that Will was gone now , and gone forever . It told me that I 'd let down the person I loved most on this earth , that I 'd failed my primary mission . And on its spiraling , smoking way through my heart and into the night , it told me I would find the people who did this to Will and I would deal with them . I managed to call my mother and brothers again . To give them the bullet . Too late , of course . They were already on their way to the hospital . Against the protests of a doctor and two sheriff deputies , I got into Will 's car and drove back to the Lind Street apartment . Red lights , yellow tape , neighbors everywhere and three blankets with bodies under them . Anaheim PD was on scene . A patrolman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I backed out and drove the dark streets and wide empty boulevards looking for the girl . I crawled along at ten miles an hour , honking twice , lightly , over and over . Up and down , going slow , brights on and all four windows down . Come out , come out , wherever you are . The fog was still thick and sometimes I could n't even see a block ahead . Every few minutes I 'd pull over , stop , honk again and listen . Watch . I finally got Mom on my cell phone and she sounded close to panic . She was at the hospital . They would n't let her see him . I did my best to keep her talking and settle her down , told her to call Reverend Alter , then turned my car around for UCI Medical Center just as an Anaheim PD cruiser pulled me over . Both officers were tight , fingering their sidearms as I badged them . " What in hell are you doing here , Deputy ? " " Looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ? " " Yes , it is . " " Step out , please , slowly . Hands away from your body , Mr. Trona. "
