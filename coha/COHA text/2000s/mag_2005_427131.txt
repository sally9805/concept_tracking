THE FAMILY STONE Sarah Jessica Parker , Diane Keaton , Rachel McAdams PG-13 , 103 mins . ( 20th Century Fox ) Free of all that Sex , Parker comes home for the holidays Which came first : the national yearning for an idealized Christmas gathering-and I do mean Christmas-in which photogenic , dysfunctional family members reunite in a nonseetarian Christian spirit of tolerance , compassion , and the swapping of perfectly wrapped gifts .. , or the Hollywood holiday movies that insist this outcome is universally attainable ? Another year , another warmedy about the importance of improved parent-child relationships and artisanal sweaters is how I see it , with only the trend-sensitive specifics of dysfunction in doubt . What 's striking and , to my bloodshot eye , welcome about this year 's edition , The Family Stone , is the rather chic urbanity with which writer-director Thomas Bezucha serves up the old genre standby . Maybe it 's because his background is in product branding and store design that Bezueha 's home-for-the-holidays fantasy is more like a beautifully styled cashmere throw draped granny afghan tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive traps of bohemian-bourgeois aspirations comedie touch , also holds its ground as an old-fashioned and even sweet atory about loveand the swapping of perfectly wrapped presents . Of the five adult children who gather for Christmas at the New England home of their handsome parents Sybil and Kelly Stone ( Diane Keaton and Craig T. NeIson ) , the oldest , Everett ( Dei-mot Mulroney ) , is the polished corporate go-getter ; Susannah ( Elizabeth Reaser ) is the traditional wife-and-mother ; Ben ( Luke Wilson ) is the SoCaI loosey-goosey guy ; Amy ( Rachel McAdams ) is the pretty rebel ; and Thad ( 1Fy Giordano ) IB the deaf one . Also the gay one , hoping to adopt a child with hio black boyfriend The saving grace for the sophisticated clan in The Family Siowf is that Thad 's sensitiveissue grand slam is not the story . Instead , what rattles the Stones is the introduction of Everett 's buttoned-down , sleeked-up fiance , Meredith ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) , whose tightly wound career-exec personality is at odda with the family 's own proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for her son 's happiness in particular . ( The sly title refers as well to the disposition of an heirloom diamond ring . ) The very bun on Meredith 's head seems to annoy Sybil ( and inflame Amy , so proudly unkempt ) , and Parker has a great time being the anti-Carrie Bradshaw while Keaton-as-matriarch is a particular joy-ninny , beautiftil , elegant , touching , and at ease with a familiar , get-out- your-hankies holiday subplot. your-hankies holiday subplot . With the Stones doing a number on her self-confidence , Meredith buses in her sister Julie ( Claire Danes as an ally and that 's where the romantic geometry gets fancy . Suffice it to aay that at one point . Meredith does let her hair down and Parker gets to put in performance as endearing as we like from her . How did Bezucha get this glam a east into this traditional a pie ? I do n't know-it 's a secret Christmas recipe . B - LS Sidebar Sex in the suburbs // <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
