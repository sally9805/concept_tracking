A Sea Change // // From the window of her New York town house , Kath Hepburn , the new queen of Hollywood , looked up and down the quiet , early morning street . It seemed that she was actually going to be spared the reporters who usually lurked beyond the iron railing in front of her brownstone . Her getaway would be fast and clean . // // At twenty-six , red-haired , freckle-faced Kath was the star she ? d always dreamed of becoming . It was the morning of March 17 , 1934 . Her agent , Leland Hayward , had just called to announce that she ? d won the Academy Award for Morning Glory . But the news would not alter Kath ? s travel plans  --  nor her mood . She and her friend Suzanne were getting out of town  --  as far away from show business as they could . // // Later , as the two women snaked through the Fifth Avenue traffic , Kath couldn ? t have missed the crowds gathering for the annual St. Patrick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidings of hard times . Of course , Kath herself had never suffered many of the hardships faced by those less fortunate during the Depression . Her chief concern during the previous years had been , as ever , her career . Fired by Broadway managers , waiting in the wings for opportunities that never arose , Kath nevertheless had remained convinced that fame was her due . // // She was right . Marching into Hollywood like a determined conqueror , she ? d scored a smash in her very first picture , A Bill of Divorcement . The acclaim was of the sort she lived for , ever since she ? d tottered out onto a makeshift stage as a twelve-year-old Beast to her best friend Ali Barbour ? s Beauty . From that moment on , Katharine Hepburn ? s dream had been to be famous . For something . For anything . // // Now she was . And she was running away . // // The problem was : Fame wasn ? t supposed to be like these past twenty months . It shouldn ? t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamorous , exciting , exhilarating . Stardom to Kath was Leatrice Joy , beaming serenely from the screen of the State Theatre in Hartford , dazzling the wide-eyed girl . But Kath ? s fame had turned out to be much more complicated than that . The night before had brought her an Oscar , but the month before , the critics had been shouting for her head , sniggering at her ignoble Broadway flop in the play The Lake . To make matters worse , her new picture , Spitfire , was so abysmal that many were calling her a fraud . The rejections hurt . Kath didn ? t understand why her ambition hit people the wrong way ; surely it was the kind of desire all Americans were raised to value . // // But her failures had simply provided ammunition to those who had been waiting to shoot her down , and they were legion . From the start , Hepburn had been a troublesome star who ? d wanted everything on her terms . Paying dues , Kath seemed to imply , was for lesser mortals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up at premieres with a handsome leading man on her arm , but rather to walk around town with a real live gibbon clinging to her neck . " The stormy petrel of the RKO studios , " Vanity Fair called her , " subject for raging controversy on two continents . " In 1934 , people either loved Katharine Hepburn or despised her . // // Burning up the wires from the West Coast in the days before the Oscars , Leland Hayward tried to tell her how she could fix things , what she needed to do and say to remain on top . Achieving fame had been the easy part , Kath realized ; holding on to it was a whole other experience , one she couldn ? t have imagined when she first set her sights on Hollywood . As she listened to what Leland was suggesting , she balked . Was it any wonder she and Suzanne were heading for France ? Was it any wonder she was just about ready to call it quits ? // // So determined she had been , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it all . Had her father been right ? He ? d called her a show-off that day six years ago when she ? d announced she was becoming an actress . For such conceit he ? d slapped her across the face . But nothing could deter her from following her dream . // // " There she is ! " // // By the time Kath stepped out of the car onto the pier , the horns of the French liner Paris were wailing mournfully behind her . And , of course , the reporters had caught up to her . Had she really thought she ? d eluded them ? Bowler-hatted sharks from the tabloids surged forward , their boxy handheld cameras already positioned at their eyes . // // " Miss Hepburn ! " // // " Miss Hepburn , " Suzanne echoed , " has no comments . " // // " Not even a ? thank you ? for the award ? " // // " Nothing , " Suzanne told them . // // Depressed and confused , Kath was oblivious to appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . Despite the warm day , she wore a wool hat , pulling it down almost to her eyes . Scampering around to the lower level of the pier , she lost herself among the gray coats and brown faces , making her way onto the ship via the third-class gangplank . // // The thirty-five-thousand-ton Paris was less the floating Versailles of earlier French liners and more a modern objet d ? art , with art nouveau staterooms and art deco fluting along its grand marble staircases . Launched in 1921 , the largest vessel ever built in France , the Paris boasted private telephones in many cabins and in the anterooms first-class passengers used to receive visitors . Gone were the old-fashioned round portholes , replaced with square , velvet-curtained windows that looked out onto wooden decks polished to a high gloss . Marlene Dietrich ? s daughter Maria Riva , soon to board the ship herself , would remember it " sparkling like a bottle of French perfume . " // // Such heady fragrance , however , had no effect on Katharine Hepburn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the press . // // " We will be abroad for four or five weeks , " Suzanne announced as she walked down the hall , pursued by a phalanx of reporters . // // " Where will you be going ? " // // " Paris , the Riviera. " // // " Why the secrecy ? Why won ? t Miss Hepburn talk to us ? " // // Suzanne just slipped inside the stateroom , shutting the door quickly behind her . There was nothing more to say . // // Huddled inside , sitting cross-legged on the bed , Kath would have been surprised had it ended there . Certainly she expected the reporters to once again bang upon the door , and they did . This was the price of fame . She ? d learned that much in the past twenty months . // // Impatiently , Suzanne opened the door once more . " I said that would be all ! " // // " And who are you ? " a newsman demanded . // // " My name is Suzanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for them ; in their reports , they ? d quite naturally get it wrong , writing it as Steel or Steele , inadvertently setting up a mystery that would take more than seventy years to unravel . " I am an old friend of Miss Hepburn ? s , and she has nothing more to say . " Then she firmly closed the door . // // Even in her fugue , Kath may have smiled at the term old friend , so bold-faced was Suzanne ? s exaggeration . They ? d known each other no more than three months , though it ? s possible they had met casually at some point earlier . Suzanne had attended New York ? s prestigious Spence School , and Kath ? s best friend , the heiress Laura Harding , counted many Spence graduates among her acquaintances . But the bond that connected Kath and Suzanne had been forged only recently . It had been Suzanne  --  and Suzanne alone , Kath felt  --  who ? d stood by her as The Lake died a slow , painful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the play ? s closing , Kath had taken refuge with Suzanne . Tall and full-figured , five years older than her movie-star friend , Suzanne possessed the kind of ingrained self-confidence Kath always admired . Suzanne suffered no fool gladly , from cabdrivers to theater critics . She issued orders with all the imperiousness of an opera diva  --  a style learned , in fact , at the elbow of Madame Maria Jeritza , her former mentor and the famed prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera . As she often did when in retreat , Kath simply folded herself into her friend ? s embrace and let her lead the way . // // Outside their stateroom door , the reporters kept up their hammering , but time was short : the ship was scheduled to sail at noon . Eventually the shouting died down , the whistles blew , and the Paris , slow and steady , began its inexorable slide down the Hudson River . // // It would be the last transatlantic voyage that the young woman called Kath ever took . // // Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more times . But on this St. Patrick ? s Day in 1934 she was leaving in a sad , disappointed , and disoriented state . When she returned , she ? d be a very different person . // // As recalled by friends , and documented by references in her own letters , this trip marked the first major turning point in Hepburn ? s career . She had scaled the heights  --  only to discover the enormous , unexpected costs of all that she had so desired . Crestfallen and deeply hurt , she had wired George Cukor , her friend and director : " Don ? t expect me back . You ? ll have to find another Red "  --  a reference to her hair , not her political leanings . // // Her friend Max Showalter called this period " the most difficult time of her whole career . " That description echoed the sentiment of Worthington Miner , director of The Lake , who remembered Hepburn as " totally demoralized " by the experience . In fact , the play ? s failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would leave an impression on Kath that would remain the rest of her life . // // " If there was a moment that her Hollywood career might have ended , " reflected Showalter , " it was at this point . There was tremendous pressure on her , and she hadn ? t learned how to survive quite yet . " // // If Leland Hayward had thought the news of her win from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences might lift her spirits , he was wrong . Kath ? s wounds from The Lake were still too raw , and the drubbing Spitfire was taking only made things worse . Back on the Coast , the Los Angeles Times critic Edwin Schallert seemed to be gunning for her . " Katharine Hepburn  --  ha , ha , ha ! " Schallert wrote , gloating over the failure of Spitfire . " Whoever said she was a box office draw ? In Little Women , yes  --  but then there were three other girls . " // // She had never taken criticism very well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sulk after being scolded by her father . Much later , she ? d pretend reviews didn ? t bother her . She ? d joke , in fact , that the critics weren ? t hard enough on her . But inside she despised them , those beasts with their poison pens : she hated to be called less than great . That fact never changed , but in 1934 she hadn ? t yet learned the art of deflection . Her heart was still strapped to her shirtsleeve . She took things very personally . // // " In this courier ? s opinion , " Brooks Atkinson , influential critic of the New York Times , had written after the New York premiere of The Lake , " Miss Hepburn is not a full-fledged dramatic actress yet . . . She has not yet developed the flexibility of first-rate acting and her voice is a rather strident instrument . " // // Of course , it was Dorothy Parker ? s smug little quip ( that Hepburn " ran the gamut of emotions from A to B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake . In truth , not all the reviews were bad  --  some were quite approving  --  but Hepburn herself would fuel the legend of The Lake ? s disaster , because that ? s how she saw it at the time : the world had turned against her . No matter that she had just won the Oscar . What counted was the way the story got spun , and the tale being told in the first few months of 1934 was that Hepburn had flopped on Broadway . One magazine headlined its story : how haughty hepburn went down in flames . Wounded , she followed her instincts , which told her to run away , to go climb a tree . // // " What Susan always told me , " said the costume designer Miles White , using Suzanne Steell ? s real name , " was that she and Kate Hepburn were escaping from Hollywood by going to Europe . Hepburn thought her career was over . She was devastated . " // // In 1934 , Katharine Hepburn was not yet the formidable personage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college , a slender girl of moderate privilege for whom success in films had come quickly and easily . This criticism , tough and mean-spirited as it was , was the first real test of her adult life , and she was running away . " I thought I was through , " she remembered . " My career was over and all that was left for me to do was go back home a failure . " That would never do , of course , not with the sting of her father ? s hand on her cheek still fresh in her memory . // // Given the Academy Award , her despair may seem overwrought . Yet to understand Hepburn ? s crisis we must move beyond the professional . Not long before , the press had discovered a very personal secret about her : she had a husband . In 1928 , just out of Bryn Mawr , she had married Ludlow Ogden Smith . As Kath had taken her first baby steps onto the stage , Luddy had been her rock  --  as in much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . But the paths of husband and wife had diverged not long after , with Luddy settling into anonymity as an industrial engineer and Kath setting out to make her name . // // When she first went to Hollywood , Katharine Hepburn never mentioned her husband . But the newshounds had a way of sniffing out the details of stars ? lives . In a fan-magazine article late in 1933 , the story of Kath ? s marriage had been spelled out . Every morning since , a parade of shouting , snapping reporters had trailed Luddy to his office on Vanderbilt Avenue . Even the compliant young man had found his breaking point . What might the press say about him ? About them and their untraditional marriage ? // // Leland Hayward worried about that , too . Times were changing . The Hollywood of March 1934 was a very different place from what it was when Kath first stepped off the train in Pasadena in July 1932 . In those twenty months , the Production Code  --  that draconian list of dos and don ? ts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen  --  had been forced down the throats of even Hollywood ? s most powerful producers . Bowing to the fear of boycotts threatened by conservative reformers ( particularly unnerving , given the precarious economic times ) , Hollywood had reluctantly ceded its creative imprimatur to the censors . It wasn ? t just on-screen content that was affected ; the stars suddenly found their personal lives under a microscope as well . Racy images so popular in the freewheeling 1920s  --  the rakish John Barrymore , the free-loving Clara Bow , the sexually ambiguous Marlene Dietrich  --  were suddenly out of style , replaced by upstanding heroes and sweet , ladylike girls next door . // // Yet from her very first day in Hollywood , Katharine Hepburn had been known best for one thing : her pants . Today , Hepburn ? s trousers have become a beloved cultural icon , but in the early 1930s they were considered subversive . Independent women seemed to offer a threat to the millions of men out of work , men whose sense of mastery over their lives and families had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1934 , Katharine Hepburn ( in pants ) was not a comforting image for much of the population  --  not even to many women . Though some took inspiration from her defiant persona , many more , as frightened as their husbands , preferred to keep the apples secure in the cart . // // Sailing out of New York Harbor in March 1934 , Kath was beginning to grasp that , if she was to survive and prosper in this new Hollywood , she would have to change , rethink , reinvent . Academy Award or not , Katharine Hepburn  --  with her men ? s trousers , gibbon , and abandoned husband  --  was not going to sell tickets or attract media adoration . For the damage didn ? t end there . Even more troubling than the discovery of Luddy were the stories about Laura Harding , whom some in the press were labeling " Hepburn ? s other half . " The Hollywood underground buzzed with rumors that the two women were more than just friends . // // Considering Laura a liability , Leland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action seemed inconceivable . Laura  --  polished , sophisticated Laura  --  from an aristocratic Main Line Philadelphia family , had been with Kath every moment since her arrival on the West Coast . Laura had taken charge of her career , designing Kath ? s wardrobe , handling her press , even negotiating on Kath ? s behalf with producers , directors , and  --  much to his growing annoyance  --  Leland himself . Not a few reporters wondered just what hold this Miss Harding had over Miss Hepburn . Setting tongues wagging , Laura had once answered an RKO official ? s demand to know who she was by declaring curtly , " Miss Hepburn ? s husband . " Gales of laughter had erupted over the comment when she and Kath returned to the house they shared in Franklin Canyon . But at the studio there were no guffaws. // // " What kind of queer arrangement is this ? " asked one newspaper caption , juxtaposing photos of Kath and Laura with images of " Hepburn ? s forgotten husband . " // // The arrival of Suzanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her agent ? s word was gospel for Kath . She adored Leland . Few things were more enjoyable than sitting with her leg draped over the arm of a chair , listening to Leland brag of seducing Hollywood ? s most beautiful women . Handsome , rangy Leland Hayward , in his finely tailored flannel suits and diamond cuff links , was one of the shrewdest agents Hollywood ever produced . He knew everyone . Lying on the couch in his office , he ? d prop three telephones on his chest , talking on all three at once . To keep his sanity , the phones never rang , just glowed with a soft red light to announce incoming calls . // // Laura ? s presence in Kath ? s life , Leland argued , was bad enough , but at least Laura was an elegant and mannerly Philadelphia blueblood . Suzanne  --  or Susan , as she was born , the daughter of a scrappy New York journalist named Willis Steell  --  was something else entirely . At age nineteen , she ? d been singing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Madame Maria Jeritza , the tempestuous Austrian opera singer known as much for her luxurious blond hair as for her voice . In January 1923 , the diva announced she had chosen Susan Steell as her prot ? g ? e , and for the next seven years , the rechristened Suzanne remained at Jeritza ? s side . In her early twenties , Steell was tall , lithe , and pretty  --  " statuesque , like a Gibson girl , " according to Miles White . Jeritza , fourteen years Suzanne ? s senior , delighted in the younger woman ? s company and was seen with her in New York , Paris , and Vienna far more often than with her husband , Baron Leopold von Popper . // // Inevitably , Jeritza ? s flamboyant reputation led to gossip . A 1930 Austrian novel featured a lead character based on the star , thinly disguised : a bisexually adventurous opera singer with a milquetoast titled husband . Another character , a young prot ? g ? e , seemed modeled after Suzanne . Called Riff-Raff , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeritza , " according to its author , Roderick Mueller-Guttenbrunn , and became an instant European best seller . Both Jeritza and Popper sued for defamation . Meanwhile , Suzanne Steell quietly sailed out of the tempest , returning to America on October 5 on the SS Rochambeau. // // Not long afterward , Steell found herself a new friend , though this time it would be she who played the mentor . The official version , given by Hepburn herself , was that Steell strode into her dressing room during the run of The Lake and offered to give her voice lessons . No doubt recalling Brooks Atkinson ? s crack about her voice being a " strident instrument , " Kath agreed . // // Many have lamented the " enigma " of Suzanne Steell , wondering just who this mysterious woman was who took Hepburn under her wing at this low point in her career . In truth , Steell was no mystery at all . She ? d made a name for herself in France singing in Massenet ? s Werther . Since returning to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rameau and Ravel . The New York Times called Steell ? s voice " full and round , " her diction " unusually good . " Just prior to walking into Kath ? s dressing room , she had appeared in a much-publicized performance at the American Women ? s Association clubhouse on West Fifty-seventh Street , taking on all the roles in Moli ? re ? s School for Wives . The New York Sun , reviewing an earlier run of the show , thought Steell moved " easily and pleasantly " between masculine and feminine gestures . Those who knew her insisted such was the case for Steell in her private life as well . // // In the paranoid climate of post-Code Hollywood , stars could not afford being touched by scandal , however distant . Leland Hayward surely considered Hepburn ? s friendship with Suzanne Steell a disaster waiting to happen . Although Riff-Raff was never published in the United States , the publicity from it trailed Jeritza , and Leland did not want it attached to Kath . Laura Harding shared his concern . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated secondhand horror stories about her to the author Charles Higham . While Kath allowed Suzanne to move in with her and cook all her meals , everyone else thought she needed to be dumped . Such talk could only have deepened Kath ? s depression as the Paris pulled out of the harbor . Luddy , Laura , now Suzanne . How much , Kath may have wondered as the ship sailed past the Statue of Liberty , was this career of hers going to cost ? // //
