Tal sat down at the game table , and Ethar sat opposite . Tal felt strangely calm now that he had accepted the challenge . He looked down at the seven rectangular depressions in the tabletop in front of him . He knew what they were , but he thought hed pretend to know less about the game . That way Ethar might underestimate him . What order are these in again ? he asked , pointing to the rectangles . Head , Heart , Temper , Skin , Speed , Strength and Special , said Ethar quickly . Each rectangle would ultimately hold one card , and that card would specify the characteristics of the beast . The Strength card would determine the beasts strength , the speed card would determine its quickness , and so on . When all the cards were in place and finalized , two five-inch high beasts of solid light would be produced , to battle it out in the marble circle in the middle of the table . Whoever played their cards right and produced the victorious beast would win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . So even when a card was in place , and your opponent could see it , it might still change . The trick of the game was to make the other player think you were making a certain sort of beast and then change it at the last moment by altering the cards that governed its seven characteristics . There was also luck , of course . There were a hundred cards , but each player was only dealt seven , all of which had three possible variations . Tal hoped that he would be lucky . Tals first card was a Phalarope , a marine animal that floated around in the water and had thousands of poisonous tendrils . Its only real use was in the Special category , because then the made beast would have poisonous tendrils . Tal knew that this card would change to a Kurshken if he applied green light from his Sunstone . Kurshken were small but very smart and quick lizards , so would be good in either Speed or Head . Unfortunately , Tal did nt know what the third variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it might turn into a Hugthing under Red light , but couldnt be sure . Hugthings were particularly nasty . They looked like a carpet of comfortable green moss , but could spring up and wrap themselves around you in an instant . For the game , a Hugthing card would be good in Skin or Strength . I will play first , if you like , said Ethar . This would give Tal a slight advantage , so he quickly nodded to say yes . Heart of a Borzog , " announced Ethar , laying the card down on the second rectangle in front of her . Tal looked at the card , which showed a fearsome , semi-human and very hairy creature roughly the size of three people across the shoulders . This was a good initial play . Borzogs would fight to the death , and beyond . Once they got a grip , they never let go , even when they were killed . Strong hearted indeed . Um , err , Head of a . . . whatever this is . . . announced Tal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to change it into a Kurshken later on , but he hoped Ethar would think he did nt know what he was doing . A Phalarope , said Ethar . She looked at the bulbous thing with its many tentacles and added , It does look something like a giant brain . Thats what I thought , said Tal , pretending he was relieved . A giant brain . Perfect for the Head . The other guard dealt them both another card . Tal picked his up slowly . At first , all he could see was a pair of red eyes in the card . Then , he slowly became aware of an outline around them . The card was showing him something hidden in a cave or a hole , with only the eyes visible . Then Tal remembered , and barely suppressed a shiver of horror . This card was of a Cavernmouth . They were horrible creatures in Aenir , who dug holes for themselves in the side of a mountain and then backed in and opened their enormous jaws . What he thought were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things throat . In the game of Beastmaker , the Cavernmouth card was unusual . It could be played in Speed , because its jaws were incredibly fast at snapping out . Or it could be played in Special , to give the created beast extendable jaws . Speed of a Gorblag , said Ethar , playing a card that looked like a large , glowing blue toad that was too fat to do anything . But one of the variations of the Gorblag card was the incredibly zappy Fleamite , an insect that could move faster than a human eye could track it . Tal knew Ethar would change that card later on . Speed of a Cavernmouth , Tal countered , playing his card . He wouldnt be changing that . Even if Ethar did change her Speed card to the Fleamite , it wouldnt be much faster than a Cavernmouth . You have played before , remarked Ethar . Few people remember the Cavernmouth can be played for Speed . I saw my great-uncle use it that way once , Tal said , still trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The game moved more swiftly then . Within a few minutes , both Tal and Ethar had six of their seven rectangles filled with cards . You hid your skill well , said Ethar as she changed the mild-mannered Klatha workbeast in her Temper rectangle to the insanely vicious Vengenarl , a creature that attacked even its own kind if they trespassed over its scent-marked boundaries . Tal nodded , but he wasnt paying attention to what Ethar said . Everything depended on him getting the best beast . Now Ethar had changed the Temper of her beast , Tal thought he knew what to play there . But once he put that card down , his beast would be complete . Did he need to make any changes ? Quickly , he scanned the seven rectangles . Head of a Kurshken . Skin of a Samheal Semidragon . Temper . . . that was to come . Heart of a Hrugen , which was a gamble , since that was actually a kind of weed that never gave up , it grew everywhere in Aenir and seemingly could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jarghoul , a cannibalistic strangling snake of the jungles of Aenir that primarily ate others of its own kind after weeks-long battles to crush each other to death ; Special , the ability of the Gossamer Bug to fly . Tal ran over all the variations in his head , while Ethar arched her fingers into a steeple and waited for his move . To see the Empress , or lose your Sunstone , she said . What is it to be ? Temper of an Icefang , said Tal , playing his final card , locking all the others in . This was his greatest gamble . He did nt know enough about this card or its properties . But he remembered Great-Uncle Ebbitt saying that the Icefangs of Aenir were among the most dangerous of creatures in the spirit world . They never got angry , or demoralized , or had any emotions at all it seemed . They just coldly fought to the very best of their ability , never distracted by danger , wounds , or anything else . And Strength of a . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tal . Let the battle begin ! Both Tal and Ethar stepped back from the table as the final cards were played . No one knew how to make Beastmaker boards anymore , but everyone had heard about the one that exploded years before , every Sunstone in it suddenly igniting . But this Beastmaker board seemed to work perfectly . The cards in their rectangles began to slowly glow brighter and brighter , and a luminous mist formed on each side of the table . Then the two clouds of mist drifted across to the battlecircle in the middle of the table , and began to slowly form into shapes . Tal held his breath , wondering what his beast would look like . Inside his head , he urged the formless lump of bright mist on , willing it to be the best beast ever made , a champion that would win his entry to see the Empress . Soon , all his troubles might be over ! Then his cloud of bright mist solidified into a brightly colored beast . It was tall and slender , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on its hind legs and had wings . Its skin was scaly and iridescent , sparkling in many different colors . Its huge , delicate-looking wings were also many colored and almost see-through . It was pretty . It was even beautiful . But did nt look at all tough or dangerous . Tal let his breath out in disappointment and shut his eyes . He did nt want to look at the opposing beast , which had also solidified out of the glowing ball of mist on the other side of the circle . Interesting , said Ethar in a puzzled tone . Tal opened one eye a fraction . Ethars beast was really ugly . It resembled a blubbery , rust-colored ball that had three arm-legs coming out the top and three out the bottom . It had four pairs of eyes spaced around its middle , and a separate , many-toothed mouth under each pair of eyes . As Tal watched , it flipped over on to its top legs and then flipped back again , very quickly . Then it deliberately fell back and actually bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Tals beast just watched the bouncy ball thing and stood there , its wings flickering like a hummingbirds . It was only when Tal looked closely that he realized it wasnt standing - it was hovering an inch above the white marble of the battlecircle . The battlecircle began to change color from white marble to red , the sign that the combat would commence . Tal took a step closer , as did Ethar and all the guards , who crowded around . Quickly , Tal looked over at Ethars cards , hoping he would see some flaw that his beast would exploit . Ethar had played the Head of a Dofyn , which was fairly standard play , since the Dofyns were the enormously clever sea dwellers of Aenir . Then the Heart of a Niphrain Ape . The Temper of a Vengenarl . The Skin of a Blorem , which as far as Tal could remember would give the beast a skin of very resilient , thick blubber . The Speed of a Fleamite . The Strength of a Jarghoul . And finally , the Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but now that hed seen the made beast , he figured it had to be bouncing . The battlecircle flashed red three times . On the third flash , Tals lizard suddenly shot forward , just as Ethars blubber-tub bounced . They met in a whirring of wings , teeth , and clawed arms - or legs - and parted just as quickly . By the Light ! ! A hit ! cried Ethar , pointing to the drops of bright emerald green blood that were welling out of the lizard-beasts forearms . Mine too , said Tal , pointing at some ugly gashes in the blubber of the bouncing beast . But his heart sank , for the blubber was very thick and the gashes did not look deep . Before Tal had finished speaking , the blubber-tub attacked again , acting on its Vengenarl temper . This time , the lizard-beast did nt meet it , but flew to one side , zipping and darting around in the air as the blubber-tub bounced and lunged , reaching out its multiple arm-legs to grab and rend . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blubber-tub was also too quick for it to easily strike . They bounced and flew , feinting attacks and withdrawals , moving so swiftly it was almost impossible to follow . Then the lizard-thing suddenly swooped in and bit out the blubber-tubs eye . It shrieked in rage , the first sound either beast had made , and one of its three-fingered limbs gripped the very edge of the lizard-beasts wing . There was a tearing sound , and part of the wing came off . The lizard-beast leaped back , but clearly it could no longer fly . No ! Tal groaned . The lizard-beast made a yipping sound to taunt the blubber-tub on , as if it did nt care about its torn wing . The blubber-tub , its eye socket bleeding , threw itself back and then bounced forward to crush its opponent . But even without wings , the lizard-beast was very fast . It zipped sideways , and a claw struck in to take out another of the blubber-tubs eyes . Furious , the great ball of blubber changed direction to hurl itself at the rainbow-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , just in time . Then it suddenly moved back , as the blubber-tub was changing direction , and bit the bulbous creature on the foot . Yes ! shouted Tal , punching the air . The lizard had bitten clean through the blubber-tubs leg , severing the foot . But it still had two on that side , and one of the other legs swung across , smacking the lizard in the head . The brightly colored beast was thrown halfway across the circle by the blow , and seemed to be stunned . It lay there , unmoving , while the blubber-tub did a flip to get back on the three good legs on its other side . Get up ! Go lizard ! yelled Tal . Kill it ! shouted Ethar . The other guards shouted too , some encouraging Tals beast , some encouraging Ethars . Slowly and murderously , the blubber-tub advanced on the motionless lizard . Then it started to bounce . A small bounce , then a slightly harder one , until it was bounding up a stretch or more . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenseless lizard . It clearly intended to crush Tals beast to death . Tal looked on , horrified . Even though the creatures were only created things of magical light , he couldnt bear to see his lizard killed . He stopped thinking about everything that depended on this little beast of many colors . He just wanted it to survive . As the blubber-tub shot up for what had to be its final bounce , Tal shut his eyes . He felt sick . Everything was over now . Suddenly the guards roared , but it was a shout of surprise , not triumph , from Ethar . Tals eyes flashed open and saw the lizard-beast flying around a stunned blubber-tub , darting in to pluck out its eyes one by one . What happened ? he asked one of the guards who had been betting on his lizard . It tricked the blubber-thing , said the guard happily . That lizards got four or five layers of wing . It could still fly , and it wasnt knocked out . Smart beast , kid . But despite losing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Blubber-tub . It had the Heart of a Niphrain Ape , so it could not give up . Bleeding from a dozen wounds , it lurched after the lizard , chasing it around and around the battlecircle . Only a matter of time now , boy , said the friendly guard . Well-Whatever the guard was going to say stopped in his throat , as the far door suddenly swung open with the screech of disused hinges . Like everyone else , Tal looked over . Something huge and very , very dark was coming through the door . A Spiritshadow , Tal realized , but one bigger than hed ever seen . Its head was all spikes and flanges , as wide and tall as the door , so it struggled to get through . A sinuous neck followed , but whatever body lay behind was too big , unless the Spiritshadow chose to shrink it . Suddenly Tal realized he was the only one still standing up . All the guards had fallen to their knees and were bowing in the Spiritshadows direction . Tal stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by the front of his tunic . Only then did he realize what . . . or who . . . this Spiritshadow was . It had to be Sharrakor the Mighty , the Empresss own Spiritshadow . The Shadowdragon who alone among its kind had a name . Sharrakors vast head reared up on its serpentine neck , and its jaws opened . Tal saw teeth of shadow , and swirling patterns of darkness . Then Sharrakor spat a great glob of shadow that fizzed through the air , straight at Tal ! Tal ducked , but the shadowspit wasnt aimed at him anyway . It struck the Beastmaker table . There was a flash of light , a sudden sizzling noise , and the still battling lizard-beast and blubber-tub were gone . Tal looked at the empty battlecircle , where small shadows ran like water , over the side of the table and on to the floor . He cringed back as several patches flowed past him , back toward Sharrakor . Tal realized , shivering , that the Spiritshadow had spat some portion of itself . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared his throat , about to protest at the Spiritshadows destruction of the game , but his shadowguard leaped up and thrust itself into his mouth , an instant gag . Tal reached up to pull it free , but the friendly Imperial Guard gripped him as well , so he couldnt move . The last pieces of shadowspit rejoined Sharrakor . The Shadowdragons head swung slowly from side to side , as if seeking another target . Then it slowly withdrew back the way it had come . When it had fully withdrawn , the door creaked shut behind it . Tals shadowguard dropped out of his mouth and the Imperial Guards visibly relaxed . What- Tal began to say , but he got no further .
