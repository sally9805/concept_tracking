// The five cardinal rules of personal style . ( From a man who does n't have any ) I ONCE LIVED WITH AN ATHLETIC TEXAN WHOSE exercise regimen and innate self-confidence allowed him to look good in everything from a pale-blue tuxedo to the fake Cherokee loincloth I bribed him to wear on special occasions . The guy could tuck a napkin beneath his chin and strangers would approach , asking where he 'd gotten it . No one suspected that we might be a couple , and wherever we went , men and women both would throw themselves at his very ugly feet . They were his only unpleasant feature , and I brought them up constantly . " A sandal ? On you ? You 've got to be kidding ! " Chuck was a retailer 's dream , a man who courted change and was able to embrace it with no nagging self-doubt . He replaced his wardrobe at least once every season , not higgledy-piggledy but with a keen eye , mixing an expensive new jacket with a thrift-store shirt and a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventive that way , relying not on trends but on his own particular sense of style , which is something I lack completely . Knowing what tie goes with what shirt is , for me , a skill on par with raising the dead , and I spent our years together in a state of constant amazement . Once , before going to a party , he gave me a makeover , tarting me up in the sorts of things he wore on a regular basis . " You look great , " everyone said . " Is that really you ? " I was n't used to such compliments , and though the attention felt good , I knew I 'd never be able to sustain it . The tightfitting pants and oiled hair left me feeling as though I were in costume , which , of course , I was . This was me disguised as Chuck 's rightful boyfriend , the one he would meet shortly ofter we broke up . When later asked why I could n't at least try to look half decent , I offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been scientifically proven , but I 'm convinced that a child 's choice of Halloween costumes forecasts the way he 'll eventually dress as an adult . Chuck had always spent a great deal of time assembling his elaborate , prize-winning outfits . Style , self-assurance , a propensity for change-by the age of six , his stone had been cast . While he tried something different every year-spy , vampire , full-blooded werewolf-I myself was always a hobo . " Trick or treat , " I 'd say . " I 'm broke , and I really like to drink ! " I chose the costume not because it was scary but because it was easy . A charcoal beard smudged on the cheeks , an oversized shirt and sport coat stained with food and cigarette ash  --  take away the hat and it 's exactly how I dress today , only more authentic . Back in my twenties , the look had a certain Tom Joad appeal , but now , accented by amber teeth and nicotine-stained fingers , the word I most often hear is gnarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , things change . While I like to think I 'm beyond the reach of trends , I 'm still susceptible to embarrassing , rashlike phases set in motion by sudden sparks of optimism . It 's a dangerous sentiment for someone with my track record , and though I try my best to beat it down , it often gets the better of me . In hopes of avoiding needless future humiliation , I 've arranged some of my more glaring mistakes into short lessons I try to review whenever buying anything new . They are as follows . Lesson One : The ass is always greener on the other guy . My biggest genetic gripe is not my height or the arrangement of my facial features but the fact that I do n't have an ass . My brother and sisters made out very well in that department , but mine amounts to little more than a stunted peach . Because I do n't have an ass of my own , I tend to be obsessed with those belonging to others . This led to an interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play professional baseball . The game itself , well , what can I tell you ? It was n't until reading a newspaper article that I realized the phrase " bottom of the ninth " referred to an inning rather than a specific player . ( In a related bit of news , when the announcer calls attention to " the mound , " he 's talking about that little hill people stand on when they pitch . ) I 'd pretty much resigned myself to living vicariously when I came across an ad , the boldfaced headline reading , TIRED OF ILL FITTING PANTS ? I do n't recall the product 's exact name , but it amounted to a fake padded butt , the shapely synthetic cheeks sewn into the lining of a generous brief . I put it on my Christmas list and was given a pair by my friend Jodi , who waited a few weeks before admitting she 'd actually sent me a woman 's ass-in essence , a fanny . And so it was , but that did n't stop me from wearing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms . It afforded me a confidence I had n't felt in years and gave me an excuse to buy flattering slacks and waist-length jackets . While walking to the grocery store or post office , I 'd invariably find myself passed by a stranger who 'd clearly thought he was following somebody else : Little Miss January , or Pamela Anderson 's stunt double . My fanny kept me warm in the winter and early spring , but come hot weather , it turned on me . The problem was the nylon padding , which , when coupled with the high temperature , acted much like a heating pad , causing me to sweat away what little ass I 'd had in the first place . Chafed and bony , by early June my natural bottom resembled a rusted coin slot . It was fun while it lasted , but unless I tore myself away , I knew I 'd be relying on prosthetics for the rest of my life . Holding the fanny to my tearstained face , I came to understand the bittersweet meaning of tough love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's for the best . " It took everything I had , but , following one last walk around the block , I retired it to its box , bought some cushions , and gingerly settled back to catch what was left of the baseball season . Lesson Two : Guys look like asses in Euro-style glasses . High school taught me a valuable lesson about glasses : Do n't wear them . Contacts have always seemed like too much work , so instead I just squint , figuring that if something is more than ten feet away , I 'll just deal with it when I get there . It might have been different in the eighteenth century , when everybody wore wire rims , but today 's wide selection means that in choosing a pair of frames , you 're forced to declare yourself a certain type of person or , in my case , a certain type of insect . In 1974 , my glasses were so big , I could clean the lenses with a squeegee . Not only were they huge , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today these frames sound ridiculous , but back then they were actually quite stylish . Time is cruel to everything but seems to have singled out eyeglasses for special punishment . What looks good now is guaranteed to embarrass you twenty years down the line , which is , of course , the whole problem with fashion . While design may reach an apex , it rarely settles back and calls it quits . Rather , it just keeps reaching , attempting to satisfy our insatiable need to make fools of ourselves . Squinting is timeless , but so , unfortunately , are the blinding headaches that often accompany it . A few years back , when I realized that I could no longer see my feet , I made an appointment with a Paris eye doctor who ran some tests and sent me off to buy some glasses . I 'd like to blame my choice of frames on the fact that I could n't see them clearly . I 'd like to say they were forced upon me , but neither excuse is true . I made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought they made me look smart and international . The frames were made of dark plastic , with octagonal lenses not much larger than my eyes . There was something vaguely familiar about them , but I could n't quite put my finger on it . After picking them up , I spent a great deal of time in front of the mirror , pretending to share intelligent comments regarding the state of Europe . " Discount our neighbors to the east and I think you 'll find we 've got a sleeping giant on our hands , " I 'd say . " A veritable sleeping giant . " I 'd been wearing the glasses for close to a year when I finally realized who they rightfully belonged to . This person was not spotted on Face the Nation or pictured on the cover of Time ; in fact , it was n't even a real person . I was in New York , passing through a toy booth at the Chelsea flea market , when I recognized my frames on the smug plastic face of Mrs. Beasley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affair . This was the talking version , original , and in her box . " Would you like me to pull the string ? " the booth owner asked . I said no , and as I hurried away I could swear I heard a small whiny voice saying something about a sleeping giant . Lesson Three : Beware the feminine mistake . " Buy it . " This is my sister Amy 's advice in regard to everything , from a taxidermied horse head to a camouflage thong . " Just get it , " she says . " You 'll feel better . " Eye something closely or pick it up for further inspection and she 'll move in to justify the cost . " It 's not really that expensive , and besides , wo n't you be getting a tax refund ? Go on . Treat yourself . " The object in question may be completely wrong for me , but still she 'll push , effectively clouding my better instincts . Once , in a Paris pet shop , she tried to talk me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of house cat . " Imagine the noise his hooves will make on the floor , " she said . " You can name him Julius . Oh , come on , get him . " She presented a very convincing argument , but just as I reached for my wallet , the animal defecated . Watery stool clung to the backs of his dainty legs , and the spell was effectively broken . " They can be trained , " she said , but by that point I was no longer listening . She 's not intentionally evil , my sister , she just loves to see that moment , the split second when doubt is replaced by complete conviction . Yes , I 'll think . I have worked hard , and buying this thing will bring me the happiness I deserve . When handing over my money , I 'm convinced that the purchase is not only right , it 's hard-won and necessary . And that 's what she likes to see , that determined look on someone 's face . Sometimes it 's good to shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At flea markets she 's all right , but in clothing stores she 's murder . I 'm slightly built , and when nothing fits me in the men 's department , she 'll slowly guide me toward the women 's . " This is nice , " she 'll say . " Why do n't you try it on ? " Maybe it 's a sweater with buttons running down the left side instead of the right . " Who 's going to notice ? " she says . " Do you actually think people pay attention to things like that ? " It does seems unlikely that someone would notice the placement of a button , but what about the shoulder pads ? " We can remove them , " she says . " Go ahead . Get it . It 'll look good on you . " Even though I 've been promised that no one will ever notice , one can always tell when I 've been shopping with Amy . I 'm the guy at the crowded steak house removing the jacket with a label reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt , the fabric slack where it should be filled with pendulous breasts . I step up to the restroom urinal and remember that these particular pants zip up the back . At this point , people notice . Amy suggests a calf-length vest would solve the problem , but I 've got a better idea . It 's called the boys ' department . Lesson Four : With a pal like this , you do n't need an enemy . I 've always liked the idea of accessories , those little pick  --  me-ups designed to invigorate what has come to feel drab and predictable . A woman might rejuvenate her outfit with a vintage Hermes scarf or a jaunty rope belt , but the options for men are n't nearly as interesting . I have no use for cuff links or suspenders , and while I 'll occasionally pick up a new tie , it hardly leaves me feeling " kicky . " Hidden accessories can do the trick , but , again , they 're mainly the province of women . Garter belt and lingerie-yes . Sock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something discreet , masculine , and practical that led me to the Stadium Pal , an external catheter currently being marketed to sports fans , truck drivers , and anyone else who 's tired of searching for a bathroom . At first inspection , the device met all my criteria . Was it masculine ? Yes , and proudly so . Knowing that no sensible female would ever voluntarily choose to pee in her pants , the manufacturers went ahead and designed the product exclusively for men . Unlike a regular catheter , which is inserted directly into the penis , the Stadium Pal connects by way of a self-adhesive condom , which is then attached to a flexible plastic tube . Urine flows through the tube and collects in the " Freedom Leg Bag , " conveniently strapped to the user 's calf . The bag can be emptied and reused up to twelve times , making it both disgusting and cost-effective . Was it discreet ? According to the brochure , unless you wore it with shorts , no one needed to know anything about it . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drive or attend football games , but I did have a book tour coming up , and the possibilities were endless . Five glasses of iced tea followed by a long public reading ? Thanks , Stadium Pal . The window seat on an overbooked cross-country flight ? Do n't mind if I do ! I ordered myself a Stadium Pal and soon realized that , while it might make sense in a hospital , it really was n't very practical for day-to-day use . In an open-air sporting arena , a piping  --  hot thirty-four-ounce bag of urine might go unnoticed , but not so in a stuffy airplane or a small , crowded bookstore . An hour after christening it , I smelled like a nursing home . On top of that , I found that it was hard to pee and do other things at the same time . Reading out loud , discussing my dinner options with the flight attendant , checking into a fine hotel : Each activity required its own separate form of concentration , and while no one knew exactly what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . I think it was my face that gave me away . That and my oddly swollen calf What ultimately did me in was the self-adhesive condom . Putting it on was no problem , but its removal qualified as what , in certain cultures , is known as a bris . Wear it once and you 'll need a solid month in order to fully recover . It will likely be a month in which you 'll weigh the relative freedom of peeing in your pants against the unsightly discomfort of a scab-covered penis , ultimately realizing that , in terms of a convenient accessory , you 're better off with a new watchband . Lesson Five : Never listen to my father . My most recent mistake was born the weekend of my brother 's wedding , when my father convinced me to wear one of his bow ties . " Come on , " he said . " Live a little ! " When worn with a tuxedo , a bow tie makes a certain kind of sense , but I was n't sure that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose was red-and-white-striped , the size of a luna moth , and as he advanced I backed toward the door . " It 's just a strip of cloth , " he said . " No different from a regular tie . Who the hell cares if it falls straight or swags from side to side ? " My inner hobo begged me not to do it , but I foolishly caved in , thinking it could n't hurt to make him happy . Then again , maybe I was just tired and wanted to get through the evening saying as little as possible . The thing about a bow tie is that it does a lot of the talking for you . " Hey ! " it shouts . " Look over here ! I 'm friendly , I 'm interesting ! " At least that 's what I thought it was saying . The bow tie left me feeling uncharacteristically breezy , and by the end of the evening I was thanking my father for his recommendation . " I knew you 'd like it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow tie . " A month after the wedding , while preparing for a monthlong cross-country trip , I bought a bow tie of my own and discovered that it said different things to different people . This one was dark-blue paisley , and while a woman in Columbus thought it made me look scholarly , her neighbor in Cleveland suggested I might be happy selling popcorn . " Like what 's his name , " she said . " The dead guy . " " Paul Newman is dead ? " " No , " she said . " That other one . Orville Redenbacher . " Name association was big , as were my presumed interests in show business and politics . In St. Louis , the bow tie was characterized as " very Charlie McCarthy , " while in Chicago a young man defined it as " the pierced eyebrow of the Republican party . " This sent the bow tie back into my suitcase , where it begged forgiveness , evoking the names of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Senator Paul Simon . " Oh , come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please let me out " Political affiliation aside , I know what the young man meant . It 's a pretty sorry world when wearing a bow tie amounts to being " out there . " I 'm just not sure which is worse , the people who consider it out there that someone 's wearing a bow tie , or the person who thinks he 's out there for wearing it . I wore my bow tie to seventeen cities , and in each of them I found myself begging for affirmation . " Do you really think it looks okay ? Really ? " I simply could not tell whether it was right for me . Alone in an elevator , I 'd have moments of clarity , but just as I reached for the knot , I 'd recall some compliment forced from a stranger . " Oh , but it looks so adorable , so cute ! I just want to take you home ! " I 'm told by my father that when I was an infant , people would peek into my stroller and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ... baby . " I 've never been described as cute , so why this sudden , strange outpouring of affection ? What was the bow tie saying behind my back ? And how could I put it in contact with twenty-year-old marines rather than sixty  --  year-old women ? It was my friend Frank , a writer in San Francisco , who finally set me straight . When asked about my new look , he set down his fork and stared at me for a few moments , saying , " A bow tie announces to the world that you can no longer get an erection . " And that is exactly what a bow tie says . Not that you 're powerless but that you 're impotent . People offer to take you home not because you 're sexy but because you 're sexless , a neutered cat in need of a good stiff cuddle . This does n't mean that the bow tie is necessarily wrong for me , just that it 's a bit premature . When I explained this to my father , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump . " He sees the bow tie , at least in my case , as a bright string wrapped around a run-of-the-mill gift . On opening the package , though , the receiver is bound to be disappointed , so why set yourself up ? It 's a question my father answers in the pained , repetitive voice of a parole officer . According to him , you set yourself up in order to exceed those expectations . " You dress to give 100 percent , and then you give 120 . Jesus , " he says , " you 're a grown man . Have n't we been through this ? " As I had years earlier with Chuck , I offered my Halloween defense , claiming it was my destiny to dress like a hobo . " Aw , baloney , " my father said , adding that if personal style were determined in early childhood , we 'd all be wearing diapers and rubber pants . He was being sarcastic , yet , still , I felt that unmistakable surge of enthusiasm announcing the twin births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
