H ello , Bob . " Bob Olinger looks up at Billy in the window and freezes on the spot . He 's a large man of vinegar aspect , a burly , dumb , squint-eyed giant with red hair , curiously infantile features , meaty hands , reeking breath , and , the Kid knows , a heart of pure lead . Two years ago he murdered Billy 's old friend John Jones by shaking Jones 's right hand with his left and squeezing it tight , which prevented Jones from drawing , and shooting him cold . Now he 's a deputy sheriff in Lincoln . There 's just no keeping some men down . For the record , his first name is not Bob but Ameredith , inflicted on him by a patriotic mother who wanted a girl . It was only yesterday that Bob had told the Kid he had no more chance of escaping under his guard than of going to heaven . Thanks for the aviso , Bob . From his perch in the window , Billy spots the prisoners Bob had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel grounds . They wo n't flee , he knows , even after Bob 's killed , for unlike the Kid they are trustees , they 've even been allowed to wear their weapons at the courthouse , since their acquittal is all but assured . No court in New Mexico will convict five men for killing four others who 'd fired on them first in a dispute over precious water rights  --  not when the accused men 's alfalfa fields needed irrigation . They 're being held at the courthouse in the room still referred to as Mrs. Lloyd 's room , named for Lawrence Murphy 's former housekeeper . And Billy 's being held , or was long enough for him to savor the irony , in the late Lawrence Murphy 's bedroom , for the Lincoln County Courthouse not that long ago was the Murphy-Dolan store , headquarters of the Irish ring against which he 'd fought for the last four years . They 'd started this mess . They 'd killed John Tunstall . Dolan and his crew had once disarmed the Kid right here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him ! It was the only two-story building in Lincoln , that 's why he can look down at poor Bob for a change instead of the latter toploftily sizing up his famous prisoner shackled to the floor before kicking his slats , as he 'd done every morning for the past seven days when it was wakeup time . Yesterday , when Sheriff Garrett left for White Oaks to order up the wood for the Kid 's gallows , he 'd double-checked Billy 's shackles , called his deputies in , Olinger and Jim Bell , and warned them to be especially vigilant . If he 's shown the slightest chance , if he 's even allowed the use of one hand , if he 's not watched at every moment , he 'll effect some plan to murder the both of you and escape . Lip-labor , said Bob after Garrett left . The sheriff ought to save his spit . Bob 's response to his boss 's absence was to gloat over Billy , to taunt him all the more . Wake up , dearie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearie ? The Kid in turn had greeted the two deputies at breakfast that morning , Ameredith and the more pleasant Jim Bell , with a cheerful " Morning , girls . " They passed the time by playing poker in the sheriff 's office . " I never did enjoy killing a person , " Bob said as he dealt . " I did . " " But I 'd love to kill you . It would give me great pleasure . " " Is that so . " Bob poured himself his first midday whiskey . Usually when the bottle was half drunk he offered Jim some . And Jim in turn , if Olinger had to use the privy , would wait until Bob had left the room and , due to the short chain on the Kid 's manacles , hold the bottle to his mouth . Is there kindness in hell ? Jim asked Bob , " What do you mean you never did enjoy it ? " " I never had a weakness for it . It did n't take with me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it sound like the cow pox . " " What is it then , sweetheart ? " " It 's just pulling a trigger . You 're the messenger , that 's all . The bullet was assigned and fired long ago , before you ever come along . " Bell said , " That 's a crazy idea . " " What about you ? " Bob asked Billy . " Was your bullet assigned ? " " Everyone 's was . You ca n't duck it , either . " " You 've ducked plenty . " " They were n't mine . " " In other words , do I have this straight ? The bullet you dodge is n't yours . But the one you do n't is . That 's  --  there 's a name for that . It 's un-American . No matter what you do , it just had to be . That 's a pissant philosophy . " " I 'll tell you why , " said Billy . " My stepfather said it . Your bullet 's coming after you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every turn you take . Spend too long in any one place , sleep too much , it 's bound to catch up . " " I myself sleep a lot . " " It 's best to keep moving . Look out ! " Olinger jumped up , knocking over his chair . He threw his cards on the table . " You little cunt-garbage , " he hissed . " Back to your hole , maggot ! " " Shoot me , Bob , and get it over with . " " I 'll get it over with ! I 'll get it over with ! " With one arm , he grabbed Billy 's chains and dragged him out the door to the head of the stairs . The other held his ten-gauge Whitneyville shotgun . " Go ahead . Run . " He released his prisoner , opened the shotgun and looked inside the breech , then closed it with a shlang . " How can I run with these shackles ? " " You 'll run if I tell you . " He kicked him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face by skidding on his elbows , and managed to break the fall halfway down . Then he turned and mounted the steep flight of stairs with baby steps enforced by the heavy shackles . " I was hoping you 'd do it , " said Bob . " If you 'd of just reached the landing I would have blasted you to hell . I 'd love to see you make a run for it . They would have to collect the little pieces in a jar . " " I would n't give you the satisfaction . " " In that case , my satisfaction shall be watching you hang . I 'll be right in front with a smile on my face . " " That 's a lie and you know it . You never smiled in your life . " Mrs. Lesnett on her walks past the courthouse heard these daily altercations . She 'd once hidden the Kid in a grain bin in her barn during the Lincoln County War . When she walked by that afternoon , Bob , to cool off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheroot while Bell and the Kid , with Bob 's half-empty bottle to pilfer , resumed playing cards inside . Bob shouted down , " Annie ! Mrs. Lesnett ! You ought to come to the hanging . Watch his neck stretch . You used to cook for him , ai n't it ? " " He 's a nice boy . " " And your husband did n't know . You hid him in a mash barrel , I heard , lest the Dolans burn you out . " " You should mind your own business . " " Well , come to the hanging . It will be fun . " And from inside the courthouse Billy 's voice shouted : " If I 'm not there they ca n't hang me ! " <p> <br> Continues ...
