One of our most popular and prolific contributors through the 1990s , Carolyn Gilman has been working for a museum in St. Louis over the past few years and poured a lot of energy into various projects marking the bicentennial anniversary of Lewis &; Clark 's expedition . Now she 's writing more fiction again and we 're happy to bring you the first results , an alien invasion story unlike any we 've seen recently . Ms. Gilman says she 's working on a novel also and we hope to see that before too long . <p> THE TOWN OF OKANOGGAN Falls lay in the folded hills of southwestern Wisconsin - dairy country , marbled with deciduous groves and pastureland that looked soft as a sable 's fur . It was an old sawmill town , hidden down in the steep river valley , shaded by elderly trees . Downtown was a double row of brick and ironwork storefronts running parallel to the river . Somehow , the town had steered between the Scylla and Charybdis of the franchise and the boutique . If you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Earl 's Cafe , and for scented soap there was just Meyer 's Drugstore . In the park where the Civil War soldier stood , in front of the old Town Hall infested with pigeons , Mr. Woodward still defiantly raised the United States flag , as if the world on cable news were illusion , and the nation were still reality . American small towns had changed since the days when Sinclair Lewis savaged them as backwaters of conformist complacency . All of that had moved to the suburbs . The people left in the rural towns had a high kook component . There were more welders-turned-sculptors per capita than elsewhere , more self-employed dollmakers , more wildly painted cars , more people with pronounced opinions , and more tolerance for all the above . Like most of the Midwest , Okanoggan Falls had been relatively unaffected by the conquest and occupation . Few there had even seen one of the invading Wattesoons , except on television . At first , there had been some stirrings of grassroots defiance , born of wounded national pride ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume of complaint had gone down . People still did n't love the occupiers , but as long as the Wattesoons minded their own business and left the populace alone , they were tolerated . All of that changed one Saturday morning when Margie Silengo , who lived in a mobile home on Highway 14 , came racing into town with her shockless Chevy bouncing like a rocking horse , telling everyone she met that a Wattesoon army convoy had gone rolling past her house and turned into the old mill grounds north of town as if they meant to stay . Almost simultaneously , the mayor 's home phone rang , and Tom Abernathy found himself standing barefoot in his kitchen , for the first time in his life talking to a Wattesoon captain , who in precise , formal English informed him that Okanoggan Falls was slated for demolition . Tom 's wife Susan , who had n't quite gotten the hang of this " occupation " thing , stopped making peanut butter sandwiches for the boys to say , " They ca n't say that ! Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanky , easygoing fellow , all knobby joints and bony jaw . Mayor was n't his full-time job ; he ran one of the more successful businesses in town , a wholesale construction-goods supplier . He had become mayor the way most otherwise sensible people end up in charge : out of self-defense . Fed up having to deal with the calcified fossil who had run the town since the 1980s , Tom had stood for office on the same impulse he occasionally swore - and woke to find himself elected in a landslide , 374 to 123 . Now he rubbed the back of his head , as he did whenever perplexed , and said , " I think the Wattesoons can do pretty much anything they want . " " Then we 've got to make them stop wanting to mess with us , " Susan said . That , in a nutshell , was what made Tom and Susan 's marriage work . In seventeen years , whenever he had said something could n't be done , she had taken it as a challenge to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaders . TOWN COUNCIL meetings were n't formal , and usually a few people straggled in late . This day , everyone was assembled at Town Hall by five P.M. , when the Wattesoon officer had said he would address them . By now they knew it was not just Okanoggan Falls ; all four towns along a fifty-mile stretch of Highway 14 had their own occupying forces camped outside town , and their own captains addressing them at precisely five o'clock . Like most Wattesoon military actions , it had been flawlessly coordinated . The captain arrived with little fanfare . Two sand-colored army transports sped down Main Street and pulled up in front of Town Hall . The two occupants of one got out , while three soldiers in the other stood guard to keep the curious at arms " length . Their weapons remained in their slings . They seemed to be trying to keep the mood low-key . The two who entered Town Hall looked exactly like Wattesoons on television - squat lumps of rubbly khaki-colored skin , like blobs of clay mixed with gravel . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like shrink wrap , from neck to heel , but neither officer had on the face mask or gloves the invaders usually employed to deal with humans . An aroma like baking rocks entered the room with them - not unpleasant , just not a smell ordinarily associated with living creatures . In studied , formal English the larger Wattesoon introduced himself as Captain Groton , and his companion as Ensign Agush . No one offered to shake hands , knowing the famous Wattesoon horror at touching slimy human flesh . The council sat silent behind the row of desks they used for hearings , while the captain stood facing them where people normally gave testimony , but there was no question about where the power lay . The townspeople had expected gruff , peremptory orders , and so Captain Groton 's reasonable tone came as a pleasant surprise , - but there was nothing reassuring about his message . The Wattesoons wished to strip-mine a fifty-mile swath of the hilly , wooded Okanoggan Valley . " Our operations will render the land uninhabitable , " Captain Groton said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will need you to coordinate the arrangements so this move can be achieved expeditiously and peacefully . " There was the ever-so-slight hint of a threat in that last word . When he finished there was a short silence , as the council absorbed the imminent destruction of everything they had lived for and loved . The image of Okanoggan Valley transformed into a mine pit hovered before every eye : no maple trees , no lilacs , no dogs , no streetlights . Rob Massey , the scrappy newspaper editor , was first to find his voice . " What do you want to mine ? " he said sharply . " There are no minerals here . " " Silica , " the captain answered promptly . " There is a particularly pure bed of it underneath your limestone . " He meant the white , friable sandstone - useless for building , occasionally used for glass . What they wanted it for was incomprehensible , like so much about them . " Will we be compensated for our property ? " Paula Sanders asked , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain answered neutrally . " The land is ours . " Which was infuriating , but unarguable . " But it 's our home ! " Tom blurted out . " We 've lived here , some of us four , five generations . We 've built this community . It 's our life . You ca n't just walk in and level it . " The raw anguish in his voice made even Captain Groton , lump of rubble that he was , pause . " But we can , " he answered without malice . " It is not within your power to stop it . All you can do is reconcile yourselves to the inevitable . " " How much time do we have ? " Paula bit off her words as if they tasted bad . " We realize you will need time to achieve acceptance , so we are prepared to give you two months . " The room practically exploded with protests and arguments . At last the captain held up the blunt appendage that served him as a hand . " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you an extension . You may have three months . " Later , they learned that every captain up and down the valley had given the same extension . It had obviously been planned in advance . The room smoldered with outrage as the captain turned to leave , his job done . But before he could exit , Susan Abernathy stepped into the doorway , along with the smell of brewing coffee from the hall outside . " Captain Groton , " she said , " would you like to join us for coffee ? It 's a tradition after meetings . " " Thank you , madam , " he said , " but I must return to base . " " Susan , " she introduced herself , and , contrary to all etiquette , held out her hand . The Wattesoon recoiled visibly . But in the next second he seemed to seize control of himself and , by sheer force of will , extended his arm . Susan clasped it warmly , looking down into his pebbly eyes . " Since we are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we might as well be civil , " she said . " That is very foresighted of you , madam , " he answered . " Call me Susan , " she said . " Well , since you ca n't stay tonight , can I invite you to dinner tomorrow ? " The captain hesitated , and everyone expected another evasion , but at last he said , " That would be very acceptable . Susan . " " Great . I 'll call you with the details . " As the captain left , followed closely by his ensign , she turned to the council . " Can I bring you some coffee ? " " Ish . What did it feel like ? " said her son Nick . Susan had become something of a celebrity in the eleven-year-old set for having touched an alien . " Dry , " she said , staring at the laptop on the dining room table . " A little lumpy . Kind of like a lizard . " In the next room , Tom was on the phone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We still might be able to get some concessions . We 're working on it . But if you start shooting at them , we 're doomed . I do n't want to hear any more about toad hunts , okay ? " " Have you washed your hand ? " Nick wanted to know . Susan let go of the mouse to reach out and wipe her hand on Nick 's arm . " Eew , gross ! " he said . " Now I 've got toad germs . " " Do n't call them that , " she said sharply . " It 's not polite . You 're going to have to be very polite tonight . " " I do n't have to touch him , do I ? " " No , I 'm sure touching a grody little boy is the last thing he wants . " In the next room , Tom had dialed a different number . " Listen , Walt , I think I 'm going to need a patrol car in front of my house tonight . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is going to be a smoking crater tomorrow . " " Is that true ? " Nick asked , wide-eyed . " No , " Susan lied . " He 's exaggerating . " " Can I go to Jake 's tonight ? " " No , I need you here , " Susan said , hiding the pang of anxiety it gave her . " What are we having for dinner ? " " I 'm trying to find out what they eat , if you 'd just leave me alone . " " I 'm not eating bugs . " " Neither am I , " Susan said . " Now go away . " Tom came in and sank into a chair with a sigh . " The whole town is up in arms , " he said . " Literally . Paula wanted to picket our house tonight . I told her to trust you , that you 've got a plan . Of course , I do n't know what it is . " " I think my plan is to feed him pizza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? I ca n't find that they have any dietary restrictions , and everyone loves pizza . " Tom laid his head back and stared glumly at the ceiling . " Sure . Why not ? If it kills him , you 'll be a hero . For about half an hour ; then you 'll be a martyr . " " Pizza never killed anyone , " Susan said , and got up to start straightening up the house . The Abernathys lived in a big old 1918 three-story with a wraparound porch and a witch's-hat tower , set in a big yard . The living room had sliding wood doors , stained-glass fanlights , and a wood-framed fireplace . It could have been fancy , but instead it had a frayed , lived-in look-heaps of books , puppy-chewed Oriental carpet , an upright piano piled with model airplanes . The comfy , well-dented furniture showed the marks of constant comings and goings , school projects , and meetings . There was rarely a night when the Abernathys did n't have guests , but dinner was never formal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an RN , but had quit , fed up with the bureaucracy rather than the patients . She had the sturdy physique of a German farm girl , and the competent independence to go with it . Light brown hair , cropped just above her shoulders , framed her round , cheerful face . Only rarely was she seen in anything more fancy than a jean skirt and a shirt with rolled-up sleeves . When they had elected Tom , everyone had known they were n't getting a mayor 's wife who would challenge anybody 's fashion sense . That night , Captain Groton arrived precisely on time , in a car with tinted windows , driven by someone who stayed invisible , waiting . Tom met the guest on the doorstep , looking up and down the street a little nervously . When they came into the living room , Susan emerged from the kitchen with a bouquet of wine glasses in one hand and a bottle in the other . " Wine , Captain ? " she said . He hesitated . " If that is customary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I only know they are complex . " " It 's fermented fruit juice , mildly intoxicating , " she said , pouring a little bit in his glass . " People drink it to relax . " He took the glass gingerly . Susan saw that he had stumpy nubbin fingers . As a nurse , she had had to train herself to feel compassion even for the least appealing patients , and now she was forced to call on that skill to disregard his appearance . " Cheers , " she said , lifting her glass . There was a snap as the stem on Captain Groton 's glass broke in two . The wine slopped onto his hand as he tried to catch the pieces . " Pardon me , " he mumbled . " Your vessel is brittle . " " Never mind the glass , " Susan said , taking it and handing the pieces to Tom . " Did you cut yourself ? " " No , of course - " he stopped in mid denial , staring at his hand . A thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take care of that , " she said . Taking him by the arm , she led him to the bathroom . It was not until she had dabbed the blood off with a tissue that she realized he was not recoiling at her touch as he had before . Inwardly , she smiled at small victories . But when she brought out a bottle of spray disinfectant , he did recoil , demanding suspiciously , " What is it ? " " Disinfectant , " she said . " To prevent infection . It 's alcohol-based . " " Oh , " he said . " I thought it might be water . " She spritzed his hand lightly , then applied a bandage . He was looking curiously around . " What is this place ? " " It 's a bathroom , " she said . " We use it to - well , clean ourselves , and groom , and so forth . This is the toilet . " She raised the lid , and he drew back , obviously repulsed . She had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear . " " It has water in it , " he said with disgust . " But the water 's not dirty , not now . " " Water is always dirty , " he said . " It teems with bacteria . It transmits a thousand diseases , yet you humans touch it without any caution . You allow your children to play in it . You drink it , even . I suppose you have gotten used to it , living on this world where it soils everything . It even falls from the sky . It is impossible to get away from it . You have no choice but to soak in it . " Struck by the startling image of water as filth , Susan said , " Occupying our world must be very unpleasant for you . What is your planet like ? " " It is very dry , " he said . " Miles and miles of hot , clean sand , like your Sahara . But your population does not live in the habitable spots , so we can not either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not that different from ours , or you would not be able to eat our food . " " The trace amounts in foods are enough for us . We do not excrete it like you do . " " So that 's why you do n't have bathrooms , " she said . He paused , clearly puzzled . Then it dawned on him what she had left out of her explanation . " You use this room for excretory functions ? " " Yes , " she said . " It 's supposed to be private . " " But you excrete fluids in public all the time , " he said . " From your noses , your mouths , your skin . How can you keep it private ? " For a moment the vision of humans as oozing bags of bacteria left her unable to answer . Then she said , " That 's why we come here , to clean it all off . " He looked around . " But there is no facility for cleaning . " " Sure there is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He reacted with horror , so she quickly shut it off . She explained , " You see , we think of water as clean . We bathe in it . How do you bathe ? " " Sand , " he said . " Tubs of dry , heated sand . It is heavenly . " " It must be . " She could picture it : soft , white sand . Like what lay under the Okanoggan limestone . She looked at him in dawning realization . " Is that why you want - ? " " I can not say anything about that , " he said . " Please do not ask me . " Which was all the answer she needed . When they came back out , Tom and the boys were in the kitchen , so that was where they went . " Sorry , we got caught up in a really interesting conversation , " Susan said breezily , with an I'll-tell-you-later look at Tom . " Captain Groton , these are our sons , Ben and Nick . " The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake hands . " They are both yours ? " the Wattesoon asked . " Yes , " Tom said . " Do you have any kids , captain ? " " Yes . A daughter . " " How old is she ? " Susan said , pouring some more wine for him in a mug . Captain Groton paused so long she wondered if she had said something offensive , but finally he shook his head . " I can not figure it out . The time dilation makes it too difficult . It would mean little to you anyway ; our years are so different . " " So she 's back home on your planet ? " " Yes . " " Your wife , too ? " " She is dead . " " I 'm so sorry . It must have been hard for you to leave your daughter behind . " " It was necessary . I was posted here . I followed my duty . " It had occurred to Susan that perhaps cow-excretion pie was not the thing to offer her guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon assembled a buffet of dry foods : roast soybeans , crackers , apple chips , pine nuts , and a sweet potato for moisture . As Tom tried valiantly to engage the captain in a conversation about fishing , she started assembling the pizza for her family . The dog was barking at the back door , so she asked Ben to feed him . Nick started playing with his Gameboy . There was a pleasantly normal confusion all around . " What sorts of food do you eat at home ? " Susan asked her guest when she had a chance . Groton shrugged . " We are less preoccupied with food than you are . Anything will do . We are omnivores . " Ben muttered , " Better watch out for our dogs . " " Ben ! " Susan rebuked him . Captain Groton turned marbly eyes on him . " We have no interest in your food animals . " The whole family stared in horror . " Our dogs are n't food ! " Ben blurted . " Then why do you keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For companionship . " Ben said , " For fun . " Susan said , " Because they remind us that we 're human . Without other species around , we 'd forget . " " Ah . I see , " the Wattesoon said . " We feel the same . " In the awkward silence that followed , the humans all wondered who were the Wattesoons " pets . They were saved by the timer . The pizza came out of the oven , and soon all was cheerful confusion again . The internet had told Susan that Wattesoons were frugal eaters , but Captain Groton seemed ravenous . He ate some of everything she put on the table , including two slices of pizza . TO SPARE their guest the troubling sight of counters , tabletop , and utensils being smeared with water , Susan asked him out to see the back yard so the others could clean up . The screen door banged shut behind them and the dog came trotting up , eager to smell the stranger , till Susan shooed him into the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crickety twilight . It was a Midwestern evening . The yard backed up onto the river bluff , a weathered limestone cliff overgrown with sumac and grapevine . Susan strolled out past the scattered detritus of Frisbees and lawn darts toward the quiet of the lower yard , where nature had started to encroach . There was an old swing hung from a gnarled oak tree , and she sat down in it , making the ropes creak . In the shady quiet , she swung idly to and fro , thinking of other evenings . She had never realized how desperately she loved this place until she was forced to think of losing it . Looking toward the dark bushes by the cliff , she saw the silent flare of fireflies . " Are you able to find this beautiful ? " she said , not trying to hide the longing in her voice . After a few moments of silence , she looked over to find the captain gazing into the dark , lost in thought . " I am sorry , " he said , recollecting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering , she said , " I think we each get imprinted on a certain kind of landscape when we 're young . We can enjoy other spots , but only one seems like we 're made from it , down to our bones . This is mine . " " Yes , " he said . " Can you understand how it is for us , then ? We talk a lot about our investments and our livelihoods , but that 's just to hide the pain . We love this place . We 're bonded to it . " He did n't answer at once , so she stopped the swing to look at him . " I understand , " he said . " Do you ? " she said hopefully . " It changes nothing . I am sorry . " Disappointed , she stared at his lumpy face . Now that she was a little more accustomed to him , he did not seem quite so rubbly and squat . He gave an impatient gesture . " Why are your people so fond of being discontent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable . It is an immature response , and makes your lives much harder . " " But , Captain , there are some things that ought to be protested . " " What things ? " " Folly . Malice . Injustice . " He cut her off in a pained tone . " These things are part of the nature of the world . There is nothing we can do to prevent them . " " You would not even try ? " she said . " Life is not just . Fairness is a fool 's concept . To fight brings only disillusion . " " Well , we are different . We humans can put up with a thousand evils so long as we think they are fair . We are striving all the time to bring about justice , in ourselves and our society . Yours too , if you would just let us . " " So your truculence is all an effort to improve us ? " the Wattesoon said . Surprised , Susan laughed . " Why , Captain Groton , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He seemed taken aback by her reaction , as if he regretted having provoked it . " I was not laughing at you , " she explained hastily . " At least , not in any way you would not wish . " " You can not know what I would wish , " he said stiffly . She said , " Oh , I do n't know about that . " For the time being , here out of all official contexts , he seemed just as difficult and contradictory as any human male . Speculatively , she said , " Your answer just now , about justice . You sounded bitter , as if you spoke from some experience . What was it ? " He stared at her with that unreadable , granitic face . For a few moments she thought he was n't going to answer . Then he said , " It is in the past . There is no point in talking about it . Today is today . I accept that . " They remained silent for a while , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Well , the great injustice of our lives is still in the future . " The thought of it flooded into her . All of this gentle valley would be gone soon , turned into an open wound in the landscape . Tears came to her , half anger and half loss , and she got up to go back inside . When she reached the back porch , she paused to compose herself , wiping the tears from her face . Captain Groton , who had followed her , said in a startled voice , " You are secreting moisture . " " Yes , " she said . " We do that from time to time , in moments of intense emotion . " " I wish - " he started , then stopped . " Yes ? What do you wish ? " " Never mind , " he said , and looked away . That night , lying in bed , she told Tom all she had learned . " Sand , " he said in disbelief . " The bastards are moving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not feeling charitable toward the Wattesoons . After their dinner guest had left in his tinted limousine , Tom had gotten a call from the mayor of Walker , the closest Wal-Mart metropolis . The captain in charge of their evacuation was an unbending disciplinarian who had presented the residents with a set of non-negotiable deadlines . The news from Red Bluff was even less encouraging . The captain assigned there was a transparent racist who seemed to think evacuation was too good for the native population . Force seemed to be his preferred alternative . " Larry wants us to mount a unified resistance , " Tom said . " A kind of " Hell no , we wo n't go " thing . Just stay put , refuse to prepare . It seems pretty risky to me . " Susan lay reflecting . At last she said , " They would think it was an immature response . " " What , like children disobeying ? " he said , irritated . " I did n't say I agreed . I said that was what they would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . Behave in a way they associate with adults . Somehow resist without seeming to resist . " Tom turned his head on the pillow to look at her . " How come you learn all these things ? He wo n't give me anything but the official line . " " You 're his counterpart , Tom . He has to be formal with you . I do n't count . " " Or maybe you count more . Maybe he 's sweet on you . " " Oh , please ! " " Who would have thought I 'd lose my wife to a potato ? " Tom mused . She quelled the urge to hit him with a pillow . " You know , he 's something of a philosopher . " " Socrates the spud , " he said . " More like Marcus Aurelius . I do n't think he really wants to be here . There is something in his past , some tragedy he wo n't talk about . But it might make him sympathetic to us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow to look at her earnestly . " My god , he really did open up to you . " " I 'm just putting two and two together . The problem is , I 'm not sure what winning him over would get us . He 's just following orders . " " Jeez , even one friend among the Wattesoon is progress . I say go for it . " " Is that an order , Mr. Mayor ? " " My Mata Hari , " he said , with the goofy , lopsided grin she loved . She rolled closer to put her head on his shoulder . All problems seemed more bearable when he was around . IN THE NEXT few weeks , no one saw much of Captain Groton . Information , instructions , and orders still emanated from his office , but the captain himself was unavailable - indisposed , the official line went . When she heard this , Susan called the Wattesoon headquarters , concerned that he had had a reaction to the odd menu she had fed him . To her surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern yourself , Susan , " he said . " There is nothing you can do . " " I do n't believe you , " she said . " You 're so in love with stoical acceptance that you could have toxic shock before you 'd admit there was anything wrong . " " There is nothing wrong . " " I 'm a nurse , Captain Groton . If you are sick , you have become my job . " There was an enigmatic pause on the line . " It is nothing you would recognize , " he said at last . " A Wattesoon complaint . " Concerned now that he had admitted it , she said , " Is it serious ? " " It is not mortal , if that is what you mean . " " Can I see you ? " " Your concern is gratifying , but I have no need of assistance . " And she had to be content with that . In the end , Tom saw him before she did . It was at a meeting the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evacuation . " It must be some sort of arthritis , " Tom answered Susan 's questions vaguely . " He 's hobbling around with a cane . A bit testy , too . " Not trusting a man to observe what needed to be noticed , Susan called Alice Brody , who had also been at the meeting . She was more than willing to elaborate . " He does seem to be in discomfort , " Alice said . " But that 's not the strange part . " Aha , Susan thought . " He 's taller , Susan . By inches . And proportioned differently . Not quite so tubby , if you know what I mean . It looks like he 's lost a lot of weight , but I think it 's just redistributed . His skin is different , too smoother , a more natural color . " " What do you think is going on ? " " Damned if I know . " That was when Susan got the idea to invite Captain Groton to the Fourth of July celebration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances - but the city council had reasoned that a day of frivolity would raise everyone 's spirits . The Wattesoons regarded it as a quaint summer festival and completely missed the nationalist connotations , so their only objection was to the potential for disorder from the crowds . When the town agreed to ban alcohol , the occupiers relented . Okanoggan Falls 's Fourth of July always climaxed with the parade , a homegrown affair for which people prepared at least three hours in advance . There was always a chainsaw drill team , a convertible for the Butter Princess , a Dixieland jazz band on a flatbed truck , and decorated backhoes and front-end loaders in lieu of floats . Deprecating self-mockery was a finely honed sport in Wisconsin . Tom was going to be obliged to ride in a Model T with a stovepipe hat on , so Susan phoned the Wattesoon commander and asked him to accompany her . " It will be a real demonstration of old-time Americana , " she said . He hesitated . " I do not wish to be provocative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were riding in a float , maybe . But mingling with the crowds , enjoying a brat and a lemonade ? Some people might even appreciate it . If they do n't , I 'll handle them . " At last he consented , and they arranged to meet . " Do n't wear a uniform , " was her last instruction . She had no idea what a dilemma she had caused him till he showed up in front of Meyer 's Drugstore in a ragbag assortment of ill-fitting clothes that looked salvaged from a thrift shop . However , the truly extraordinary thing was that he was able to wear them at all - for when she had last seen him , fitting into human clothes would have been out of the question . Now , when she greeted him , she realized they were the same height , and he actually had a chin . " You look wonderful , " she blurted out . " You are exaggerating , " he said in a slightly pained tone . " Are you feeling all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clothes . Oh dear . " " Are they inappropriate ? " he asked anxiously . She looked around at all the American summer slobbery - men in baggy T-shirts and sandals , women bursting out of their tank tops . " No , " she said . " You 'll fit right in . It 's just that , for a man in your position .... " She grabbed him by the hand and dragged him into the drugstore , making for the magazine rack . She found an issue of GQ and thrust it into his hands . " Study that , " she said . " It will show you what the elite class of men wear . " Perusing several other magazines , she found some examples of a more khakified , Cape Cod look . " This is more informal , but still tasteful . Good for occasions like this , without losing face . " He was studying the pictures with a grave and studious manner . " Thank you , Susan . This is helpful . " With a pang , she wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . They were heading for the counter to buy the magazines when he stopped , riveted by the sight of the shelves . " What are these products for ? " " Grooming , personal care , " Susan said . " These are for cleaning teeth . We do it twice a day , to prevent our breath smelling bad and our teeth going yellow . These are for shaving off unwanted hair . Men shave their faces every day , or it grows in . " " You mean all men have facial hair ? " Captain Groton said , a little horrified . " Yes . The ones who do n't want beards just shave it off . " " What about these ? " he said , gesturing to the deodorants . " We spread it under our arms every day , to prevent unpleasant odors . " Faintly he said , " You live at war with your bodies . " She laughed . " It does seem that way , does n't it ? " She looked down the aisle at the shampoos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other products attesting to the ways in which even humans found their own bodies objectionable . Beth Meyer was manning the counter , so Susan introduced her to Captain Groton . Unable to hide her hostility , Beth nevertheless said , " I hope you learn something about us . " " Your shop has already been very instructive , Mrs. Meyer , " the captain said courteously . " I never realized the ingenuity people devote to body care . I hope I may return some day . " " As long as we 're open we wo n't turn away a customer , " Beth said . Outside , things were gearing up for the parade , and it was clear that people were spontaneously going to use it to express their frustration . Some of the spectators were carrying protest signs , and along the sidewalk one local entrepreneur had set up a Spike the Spud concession stand offering people a chance to do sadistic things to baked potatoes for a few dollars . The most popular activity seemed to be blowing up the potatoes with firecrackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the plywood booth . A reporter from an out-of-town TV station was interviewing the proprietor about his thriving business . The word " Wattesoon " never passed anyone 's lips , but no one missed the point . Including Captain Groton . Susan saw him studying the scene , so she said quietly , " It 's tasteless , but better they should work it out this way than in earnest . " " That is one interpretation , " he said a little tensely . She reminded herself that it was n't her symbolic viscera plastering the booth walls . His radio chose that moment to come to life . Susan had n't even realized he was carrying it , hidden under his untucked shirt . He said , " Excuse me , " and spoke into it in his own language . Susan could not tell what was being said , but the captain 's voice was calm and professional . When he finished , she said , " Do you have soldiers ready to move in ? " He studied her a moment , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been foolish of us not to take precautions . " It occurred to her then that he was their advance reconnaissance man , taking advantage of her friendship to assess the need for force against her neighbors . At first she felt a prickle of outrage ; it quickly morphed into relief that he had not sent someone more easily provoked . " Hey , captain ! " The man at the Spike the Spud stand had noticed them , and , emboldened by the TV camera , had decided to create a photogenic scene . " Care to launch a spud missile ? " The people standing around laughed nervously , transfixed to see the Wattesoon 's reaction . Susan was drawing breath to extricate him when he put a restraining hand on her arm . " I fear you would think me homicidal , " he said in an easygoing tone . Everyone saw then that he understood the message of sublimated violence , but chose to take it as a joke and not a provocation . " No homicide involved , just potatoes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sloppy white T-shirt . His joking tone had a slightly aggressive edge . " Come on , I 'll give you a shot for free . " Captain Groton hesitated as everyone watched intently to see what he would do . At last he gave in . " Very well , " he said , stepping up to the booth , " but I insist on paying . No preferential treatment . " The boothkeeper , an amateur comedian , made a show of selecting a long , thin potato that looked remarkably like his customer . He then offered a choice of weapons : sledge hammer , ax , firecracker , or other instruments of torture . " Why , the firecracker of course , " the captain said . " It is traditional today , is it not ? " " American as beer . " One segment of the crowd resented that the Wattesoons had interfered with their patriotic right to inebriation . The boothkeeper handed him the potato and firecracker . " Here , shove it in . Right up its ass . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the booth and said , " Say when . " When the captain gave the word , the man lit the fuse . They waited breathlessly ; then the potato exploded , splattering the boothkeeper in the face . The onlookers hooted with laughter . Captain Groton extracted himself with an amiable wave , as if he had planned the outcome all along . " You were a remarkably good sport about that , " Susan said to him as they walked away . " I could have obliterated the tuber with my weapon , " he said , " but I thought it would violate the spirit of the occasion . " " You 're packing a weapon ? " Susan stared . Wattesoon weapons were notoriously horrific . He could have blown away the booth and everyone around it . He looked at her without a shade of humor . " I have to be able to defend myself . " The parade was about to commence , and Susan was feeling that she was escorting an appallingly dangerous person , so she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . " " Over here , " Captain Groton said . He had already scoped out the terrain and located the best spot for surveillance : the raised stoop of an old apartment building , where he could stand with his back to the brick . He climbed the steps a bit stiffly , moving as if unused to knees that bent . Okanoggan Falls had outdone itself . It was a particularly cheeky parade , full of double-entendre floats like the one carrying a group called the No Go Banjoes playing " Do n't Fence Me In , " or the " I Do n't Wan na Mooove " banner carried by the high school cheerleading squad in their black-and-white Holstein costumes . The captain 's radio kept interrupting , and he spoke in a restrained , commanding voice to whoever was on the other end . In the end , it all passed without intervention from any soldiers other than the one at Susan 's side . When the crowd began to disperse , she found that she had been clenching her fists in tension , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been running . " What happens now ? " Captain Groton said . He meant it militarily , she knew ; all pretense of his purpose being social was gone . " Everyone will break up now , " she said . " Some will go to the school ballfield for the fund-raiser picnic , but most wo n't gather again till the fireworks tonight . That will be about nine-thirty or ten o'clock . " He nodded . " I will go back to base , then . " She was battling mixed feelings , but at last said , " Captain - thank you , I think . " He studied her seriously . " I am just doing my duty . " That night on the television news , the celebration in Okanoggan Falls was contrasted with the one in Red Bluff , where a lockdown curfew was in place , fireworks were banned , and Wattesoon tanks patrolled the empty streets . A week later , when Susan phoned Captain Groton , Ensign Agush took the call . " He can not speak to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ? " Susan said , thinking she had heard wrong . " He has contracted one of your human diseases . " " Has anyone called a doctor ? " " No . He will be dead soon . There is no point . " Half an hour later , Susan was at the Wattesoon headquarters with her nurse 's kit in hand . When the ensign realized he was facing a woman with the determination of a stormtrooper , he did not put up a fight , but showed her to the captain 's quarters . He still seemed unconcerned about his commanding officer 's imminent demise . Captain Groton slumped in a chair in his spartan but private sitting room . The transformation in his appearance was even more remarkable ; he was now tall and slender , even for a human , and his facial features had a distinctly human cast . He might have passed for an ordinary man in dim light . An exceedingly miserable ordinary man . His eyes were red-rimmed , his face unshaved ( she noted the facial hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croak when he said , " Susan ! I was just thinking I should thank you for your kindness before .... " He was interrupted by a sneeze . Still preoccupied with his appearance , she said , " You are turning human , are n't you ? " " Your microbes evidently think so . " He coughed phlegm . " I have contracted an exceedingly repulsive disease . " She drew up a chair next to him . " What are your symptoms ? " He shook his head , obviously thinking the subject was not a fit one . " Do n't be concerned . I am resigned to die . " " I 'm asking as a professional . " Reluctantly , he said , " This body appears to be dissolving . It is leaking fluids from every orifice . There , I told you it was repulsive . " " Your throat is sore ? Your nose is congested ? Coughing and sneezing ? " " Yes , yes . " " My dear captain , what you have is called a cold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite warm . " " That 's probably because you have a fever . " She felt his forehead . " Yes . Well , fortunately , I 've brought something for that . " She brought out a bottle of aspirin , some antihistamine , decongestant , and cough suppressant . She added a bottle of Vitamin C for good measure . " You are not alarmed ? " he asked hesitantly . " Not very . In us , the disease normally cures itself in a week or so . Since your immune system has never encountered it before , I 'm not sure about you . You have to level with me , captain . Have you become human in ways besides appearance ? " Vaguely , he said , " How long has it been ? " " How long has what been ? " " Since I first saw you . " She thought back . " About six weeks . " " The transformation is far advanced , then . In three weeks I will be indistinguishable from one of you . " " Internally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the difference . " " Then it should be safe to treat you as if you were human . I 'll be careful , though . " She looked around the room for a glass of water . " Where 's your ba - " It was a Wattesoon apartment ; of course there was no bathroom . By now , she knew they excreted only hard , odorless pellets . " Where can I get a glass of water ? " " What for ? " He looked mildly repulsed . " For you to drink with these pills . " " Drink ? " " You mean to tell me you 've had no fluids ? " " We do n't require them .... " " Oh , dear Lord . You 're probably dehydrated as well . You 're going to have to change some habits , captain . Sit right there . I need to run to the grocery store . " At the grocery she stocked up on fruit juices , bottled water , tissues , and , after a moment 's hesitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to him . She also bought soap , a washcloth , mouthwash , shaving gel , a packet of plastic razors , a pail , and a washbasin . Like it or not , he was going to have to learn . She had dealt with patients in every state of mental derangement , but never had she had to teach one how to be human . When she had gotten him to down the pills and a bottle of orange juice , she explained the purpose of her purchases to him in plain , practical language . She showed him how to blow his nose , and explained how a human bladder and bowel worked , and the necessity of washing with soap and water . When she finished he looked , if anything , more despairing than before . " It is not common knowledge to us that you are hiding these bodily deficiencies , " he said . " I fear I made a grave error in judgment . " " You 're a soldier , " she said . " Stop dramatizing , and cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her commanding tone . Then she could see him marshaling his courage as if to face dismemberment and death . " You are justified to rebuke me , " he said . " I chose this . I must not complain . " Soon the antihistamine was making him drowsy , so she coaxed him to return to bed . " You 're best off if you just sleep , " she told him . " Take more of the pills every four hours , and drink another bottle every time you wake . If you feel pressure and need to eliminate liquid , use the pail . Do n't hold it in , it 's very bad for you . Call me in the morning . " " You 're leaving ? " he said anxiously . She had intended to , but at his disconsolate expression she relented . It made her realize that she could actually read expressions on his face now . She drew up a chair and sat . " I must say , your comrades here do n't seem very sympathetic . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling . At last he said , " They are ashamed . " " Of what ? You ? " " Of what I am becoming . " " A human ? They 're bigots , then . " " Yes . You have to understand , Susan , the army does n't always attract the highest caliber of men . " She realized then that the drug , or the reprieve from death , had broken down his usual reticence . It put her in an odd position , to have the occupying commander relying on her in his current unguarded condition . Extracting military or political secrets would clearly violate medical ethics . But was personal and cultural information allowed ? She made a snap decision : nothing that would hurt him . Cautiously , she said , " I did n't know that you Wattesoons had this ... talent ... ability ... to change your appearance . " " It only works with a closely related species , " he said drowsily . " We were n't sure you were similar enough . It appears you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused a long time , then said , " I will tell you some day . The trait has been useful to us , in adapting to other planets . Planets more unlike our own than this one is . " " Is that why you changed ? To be better adapted ? " " No . I felt it was the best way to carry out my orders . " She waited for him to explain that ; when he did n't , she said , " What orders ? " " To oversee the evacuation on time and with minimal disturbance . I thought that looking like a human would be an advantage in winning the cooperation of the local populace . I wanted you to think of me as human . I did not know of the drawbacks then . " " Well , I do n't think you would have fooled us anyway , " Susan said a little skeptically . " Can you change your mind now ? " " No . The chameleon process is part of our reproductive biology . We can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reproduction brought up something she had often wondered about . " Why are there no Wattesoon women here ? " she asked . The subject seemed to evoke some sort of intense emotion for him . In a tight voice , he said , " Our women almost invariably die giving birth . The only ones who survive , as a rule , are childless , and they are rare . If it were not for the frequency of multiple births , we would have difficulty maintaining our population . We see the ease with which you human women give birth , and envy it . " " It was n't always this way , " Susan said . " We used to die much more frequently , as well . But that was n't acceptable to us . We improved our medicine until we solved the problem . " Softly , he said , " It is not acceptable to us , either . " A realization struck her . " Is that what happened to your wife ? " " Yes . " She studied his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did . Too much . " " You ca n't blame yourself for her death . " " Who should I blame ? " " The doctors . The researchers who do n't find a cure . The society that does n't put a high enough priority on finding a solution . " He gave a little laugh . " That is a very human response . " " Well , we have solved our problem . " He considered that answer so long she thought he had fallen asleep . But just as she was rising to check , he said , " I think it is better to go through life as a passerby , detached from both the good and the bad . Especially from the good , because it always goes away . " Gently , Susan said , " Not always . " He looked at her with clouded eyes . " Always . " And then he really did fall asleep . That evening , after the boys had gone up to their rooms , Susan told Tom everything over wine . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poor bastard . Sounds worse than puberty , all crammed into nine weeks . " " Tom , you could really help him out , " Susan said . " There are things you could tell him , man to man , that I ca n't - " " Oh no , I could n't , " Tom said . " No way . " She protested , " But there are things about male anatomy - you expect me to warn him about all that ? " " Better you than me , " Tom said . " Coward , " she said . " Damn right . Listen , men just do n't talk about these things . How am I supposed to bring it up ? More to the point , why ? He got himself into this . It was a military strategy . He even admitted it to you : he wanted to manipulate us to cooperate in our own conquest . I do n't know why you 're acting as if you 're responsible for him . " Tom was right . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own reaction . She had been empathizing as if Captain Groton were her patient , not her enemy . He had deliberately manipulated her feelings , and it had worked . Well , she thought , two could play at that game . It was not to be a summer of days at the beach , or fishing trips , or baseball camp . Everyone was busy packing , sorting , and getting ready to move . Susan marshaled Nick and Ben into the attic and basement to do the easy part , the packing and stacking , but the hardest part of moving was all hers : making the decisions . What to take , what to leave . It was all a referendum on her life , sorting the parts worth saving from the rest . No object was just itself : it was all memories , encapsulated in grimy old toys , birthday cards , garden bulbs , and comforters . All the tiny , pointillist moments that together formed the picture of her life . Somehow , she had to separate her self from the place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The summer was punctuated with sad ceremonies like the one when they started disinterring the bodies from the town cemetery , the day when the crane removed the Civil War soldier from the park , and the last church service before they took out the stained glass windows . After the dead had left , the town paradoxically seemed even more full of ghosts . The protests did not die down . Red Bluff was in a state of open rebellion ; a hidden sniper had picked off three Wattesoon soldiers , and the army was starting house-to-house searches to disarm the populace . In Walker , angry meetings were televised , in which residents shouted and wept . In Okanoggan Falls , they negotiated . The Wattesoons were now paying to move three of the most significant historic buildings , and the school district would be kept intact after relocation . Captain Groton had even agreed to move the deadline two weeks into September so the farmers could harvest the crops - a concession the captains in Red Bluff and Walker were eventually forced to match , grudgingly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a limousine , but driving a rented SUV to supervise contractors , meet with civic groups , or simply to stop for lunch at Earl 's Cafe and chat with the waitress . Outwardly , there was no longer a hint of anything Wattesoon about him , unless it was his awkwardness when asked to tie a knot or catch a baseball . He had turned into a tall , distinguished older man with silver hair , whose manners were as impeccable as his dress . In social settings he was reserved , but occasionally something would catch his whimsy , and then he had a light , tolerant laugh . At the same time , a steely authority lay just under the surface . The women of Okanoggan began to notice . They began to approach and engage him in conversation - urgently , awkwardly warm on their side , full of self-conscious laughter ; and on his side , studiously attentive but maddeningly noncommittal . People began to talk about the fact that he went every week to dine at the Abernathy home , whether Tom was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barber shop , and when they drove together to La Crosse to visit the mall . Her good humor began to irritate the other women in ways it never had before , and their eyes followed her when she passed by . " She must of kissed that frog good , " cause he sure turned into a prince , " said Jewell Hogan at the beauty salon , and the remark was considered so witty it was repeated all over town . For herself , Susan had found one more reason to love her life in Okanoggan Falls just before losing it . She was playing a game that gave her life an exotic twist , excitement it had lacked . It was her patriotic duty to lie awake each morning , thinking of ways to get closer to a thrillingly attractive , powerful man who clearly enjoyed her company and relied on her in some unusually intimate ways . In the last month before it all fell apart , her life had become nearly perfect . Between arranging to move his business and the mayoral duties , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over for dinner . Susan was aware of the gossip - a blushing Nick had told her the boys were taunting him about his mother-but she was not about to let small-mindedness stop her . " Just wait till they see how it pays off , " she said to Nick . It made her think she needed to start making it pay off . By now , Captain Groton was perforce conversant with the ceremonial foods of the Midwest - string bean casserole , jello salad , brats and beans - and the communal rituals at which they were consumed . So Susan had been entertaining herself by introducing him to more adventurous cuisine . His tastes were far less conservative than Tom 's , and he almost invariably praised her efforts . On one night when Tom was returning late , she ordered a pizza for the boys and prepared shrimp with wild rice , cilantro , artichokes , and sour cream , with just a hint of cayenne pepper and lemon . They ate in the dining room with more wine than usual . The captain was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the endless efforts to deter the Wattesoons from their plans , had tried to convince him that there was an important archaeological site with buried treasure underneath the town . He had even produced proof in the form of an old French map and a photo of a metallic object with a mysterious engraved design . Susan laughed , a little giddy from the wine . " You did n't fall for it , did you ? " Captain Groton looked at her quizzically . " No , I did n't fall down . " His English was so good she almost never encountered a phrase he did n't know . " It 's an expression , to fall for something . It means he was pulling your leg . " " Pulling my leg . And so I was supposed to fall down ? " " No , no , " she said . " It 's just an idiom . To fall for something is to be deceived . On the other hand , to fall for someone means to become fond of them , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You use the same expression for being deceived and falling in love ? " It had never struck her before . " I guess we do . Maybe it means that you have to have illusions to fall in love . There is a lot of self-deception involved . But a lot of truth as well . " She suddenly became aware how seriously he was watching her , as if the topic had been much on his mind . When their eyes met , she felt a moment of spontaneous chemical reaction ; then he looked away . " And when you say Okanoggan Falls , " which do you mean , deception or love ? " he asked . " Oh , love , no question . " " But if it meant deception , you would not tell me , " he said with a slight smile . " I am not deceiving you , captain , " she said softly . And , a little to her own surprise , she was telling the truth . There was a moment of silence . Then Susan rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go to the back yard , " she said . He followed her out into the hot summer night . It was late August ; the surrounding yards were quiet except for the cicadas buzzing in the trees and the meditative sigh of air conditioners . When they reached the deeper grass under the trees , the captain came to a halt , breathing in the fragrant air . " The thing I was not expecting about being human is the skin , " he said . " It is so sensitive , so awake . " " So you like it now , being human ? " she asked . " There are compensations , " he said , watching her steadily . Her intellect told her she ought to be changing the subject , pressing him on the topic of public concern , but her private concerns were flooding her mind , making it impossible to think . She was slightly drunk , or she never would have said it aloud . " Damn ! It 's so unfair . Why does such a perfect man have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken it as an invitation . Captain Groton hesitated , then with great restraint took her hands chastely in his . " Susan , " he said , " There is something I need to explain , or I would be deceiving you . " He drew a breath to steady himself as she watched , puzzled at his self-consciousness . He went on , " It is not an accident , this shape I have assumed . On my planet , when a woman chooses a man , he becomes what she most wishes him to be . It is the function of the chameleon trait . We would have died out long ago without it . " He gave a slight smile . " I suppose nature realized that men can never be what women really want until they are created by women . " Susan was struggling to take it in . " Created by ... ? But who created you ? " " You did , " he said . " You mean - " " That first day we met , when you touched me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch by the right woman is enough to set off the reaction . After that , physiology takes over . Every time you touched me after that , it was biochemical feedback to perfect the process . " All the misery and shock of an interspecies transformation , and she had done it to him ? " Oh my God , you must hate me , " she said . " No . Not at all . " Of course not . Her perfect man would never hate her . It would defeat the purpose . At that thought , she felt like a bird that had flown into a window pane . " You mean you are everything I want in a man ? " she said . " Evidently . " " I thought Tom was what I wanted , " she said faintly . " You already have him , " Captain Groton said . " You do n't need another . " She studied his face , custom-made for her , like a revelation of her own psyche . It was not a perfect face , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience and sadness . " What about your personality ? " she asked . " Did I create that , too ? " He shook his head . " That is all mine . " " But that 's the best part , " she said . She could n't see his face in the dim light , but his voice sounded deeply touched . " Thank you . " They were acting like teenagers . They were like teenagers , in the power of an unfamiliar hormonal rush , an evolutionary imperative . The instant she realized it , it shocked her . She had never intended to cheat on Tom , not for a nanosecond . And yet , it was as if she already had , in her heart . She had fantasized a lover into being without even realizing it . He was the living proof of her infidelity of mind . Trying to be adult , she said , " This is very awkward , captain . What are we going to do ? " " I do n't know , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light came on , and they jumped apart guiltily , as if caught doing what they were both trying to avoid thinking about . Tom was standing on the back porch , looking out at them . " You 're back ! " Susan called brightly , hoping her voice did n't sound as strained as she felt . She started up the lawn toward the house , leaving Captain Groton to follow . " Have you eaten ? " " Yes , " Tom said . " I stopped at the Burger King in Walker . " " Oh , poor dear . I was just about to make coffee . Want some ? " " I am afraid I must be getting back to base , " Captain Groton said . " Wo n't you even stay for coffee ? " Susan said . " No , it is later than I realized . " With a rueful laugh he added , " Now I understand why humans are always late . " She went with him to the front door , leaving Tom in the kitchen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan , " he said , and she knew it was n't for dinner . Softly , she said , " Your women are lucky , captain . " Seriously , he said , " No , they 're not . " " Their lives may be brief , but I 'll bet they 're happy . " " I hope you are right . " He left , hurrying as if to escape his memories . When Susan went back into the kitchen , Tom said with studied casualness , " Did you make any headway with him ? " " No , " shesaid . " He 's very dutiful . " She busied herself pouring coffee . When she handed him his cup , for the first time in their marriage she saw a trace of worry in his eyes . She set the cup down and put her arms around him . " Tom , " she said fiercely , " I love you so much . " He said nothing , but held her desperately tight . And yet , that night as she lay awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . There was a hole in her life she had not even known was there . Now that she knew it , she could not ignore the ache . She had settled into a life of compromises , a life of good-enough . And it was no longer good enough . Yet there was no way for her to have more without hurting Tom . She did n't love him any less for the revelation that he was n't perfect for her , he was human , after all . None of this was his fault . She looked at the lump of covers that was her husband , and thought of all she owed him for years of loyalty and trust . Somehow , she needed to turn from possibility and desire , and pass on by . She had to reconcile herself to what she had . It was simply her duty . THE DAY of the move was planned down to the last detail , the way the Wattesoons did everything . Fleets of moving vans , hired from all over the region , would descend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wattesoon base , they would roll into town at eight sharp and fan out to assigned locations . The schedule of times when each household would be moved had been published in the paper , posted in the stores , and hand-delivered to each doorstep . There was a website where everyone could find their own move time . The protesters were organized as well . The word had gone out that everyone was to gather at seven A.M. in the park opposite Town Hall . From there , they would march down Main Street to the spot where the highway ran between the bluff and the river , and block the route the trucks would have to take into town . When Susan and Tom pulled into the mayor 's reserved parking spot behind Town Hall at six forty-five , it was clear the rally had drawn a crowd . The local police were directing traffic and enforcing parking rules , but not otherwise interfering . Lines of people carrying homemade signs , thermos bottles , and lawn chairs snaked toward the park , as if it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a handheld PA system going . When Tom and Susan reached the front steps of Town Hall , Walt Nodaway , the Police Chief , saw them and came up . " We 've got some professionals from out of town , " he said . " Probably drove in from Madison . " " You have enough guys ? " Tom asked . " As long as everyone stays peaceable . " " The officers know not to interfere ? " " Oh , yeah . " They had talked it over at length the night before . A reporter came up , someone from out of town . " Mayor Abernathy , are you here to support the protesters ? " she asked . Tom said , " Everyone has a right to express their opinions . I support their right whether I agree with them or not . " " But do you agree with the people resisting the relocation ? " Susan had coached him not to say " No comment , " but she could tell he wanted to right now . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . I know how they feel . " Susan squeezed his hand to encourage him . The city council members had begun to arrive , and they gathered on the steps around Tom , exchanging low-toned conversations and watching the crowd mill around . The protest was predictably late getting started ; it was seven thirty before the loudspeaker shrieked to life and someone started to lead a chorus of " We Shall Not Be Moved . " People were starting to line up for the two-block march down to the highway when , from the opposite direction , a familiar black SUV came speeding around the police barricades and pulled up in front of Town Hall . A van that had been following it stopped on the edge of the park . Captain Groton got out , followed by three Wattesoon guards who looked even more lumpish than usual beside their lean commander . All were in sand-colored uniforms . The captain cast an eye over the park , where people had just started to realize that the opposition had arrived , and then he turned to mount the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low , commanding voice , " A word with you , Mayor Abernathy . Inside . " He turned to the city council members . " You too . " Then he continued up the steps to the door . The others followed . A few spectators were able to crowd inside before the Wattesoon guards closed the doors , - Susan was one of them . She stood with the other onlookers at the back of the room as Captain Groton turned to the city officials . They had never seen him really angry before , and it was an unsettling sight . There was a cold intensity about him , a control pulled tight and singing . " I am obliged to hold all of you responsible for the behavior of those people outside , " he said . " They must return to their homes immediately and not interfere with the operation in progress . " He turned to Tom . " I would prefer that the order come from you , Mayor . " " I ca n't give them that order , " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . For two , they 're not going to obey it , regardless of what I say . I 'm not their commander , just their mayor . They elected me , they can unelect me . " " You have a police force at your disposal . " " Just Walt and three officers . They ca n't act against the whole town . There must be four hundred people out there . " " Well then , consider this , " Captain Groton said . " I do have a force at my disposal . Two hundred armed soldiers . Ten minutes ago , they started to surround the park outside . They are only waiting for my order to move in and start arresting noncompliants . We have a secure facility ready to receive prisoners . It is your decision , Mayor . " Somehow , they had not expected such heavy-handed tactics . " There are children out there , and old people , " Tom protested . " You ca n't have soldiers rough them up . They 're just expressing their views . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views . The time for that is over . " " The time for that is never over , " Tom said . Their eyes met for a moment , clashing ; then Captain Groton changed his tone . " I am at my wit 's end , " he said . " You have known from the beginning what we were here for . I have never lied to you , or concealed anything . I have done everything in my power to make you content . I have compromised till my superiors are questioning my judgment . And still you defy me . " " It 's not you , Captain , " Tom said in a more conciliatory tone . " You 've been very fair , and we 're grateful . But this is about something bigger . It 's about justice . " " Justice ! " Captain Groton gave a helpless gesture . " It is about fantasy , then . Something that never was , and never will be . Tell me this : Do you call the earthquake unjust , or march against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for their actions . They do n't have hearts , or consciences . " " Well , if it would help reconcile you , assume that we do n't , either . " With a level gaze , Tom said , " I know that 's not true . " For a moment Captain Groton paused , as if Tom had scored a hit . But then his face hardened . " I have misled you , then , " he said . " We are implacable as a force of nature . Neutral and inevitable . Neither your wishes , nor mine , nor all those people 's out there can have the slightest influence on the outcome . " Outside , the crowd had gathered around the steps , and now they were chanting , " The people , united , will never be defeated . " For a moment the sound of their voices was the only thing in the room . In a low tone , Captain Groton said , " Show some leadership , Tom . Warn them to get out of here and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , then I have to give the order . I 'm sorry , but it is my duty . " Tom stared at him , angry at the betrayal , furious to be made into a collaborator . Captain Groton met his gaze levelly , unyielding . Then , for an instant , Tom glanced at Susan . It was very quick , almost involuntary , but everyone in the room saw it . And they knew this was about more than principle . Tom drew himself up to his full height , his spine visibly stiffening . Ordinarily , he would have consulted with the council ; but this time he just turned and walked to the door . As he passed by , Susan fell in at his side . The onlookers made way . Not a soul knew what Tom was going to do . Outside , the Wattesoon guards keeping the crowd away from the door fell back when Tom came out onto the steps . He held up his hands and the chanting faltered to a stop . " Listen up , everyone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gestured at the woman with the portable loudspeaker , and she hurried up the steps to give him the microphone . " Listen up , everyone , " he said again . The crowd had fallen utterly silent , for they saw how grim his face looked . " The Wattesoon soldiers have surrounded us , and in ten minutes they 're going to move in and start arresting people . " There was a stir of protest and alarm through the crowd . " They 're bluffing , " someone called out . " No they 're not , " Tom said . " I know this captain pretty well by now . He 's dead serious . Now , if you want to get arrested , roughed up , and put in a Wattesoon jail , fine . But everyone else , please go home . Take your kids and get out of here . I do n't want you to get hurt . You know they can do it . " On the edges , some people were already starting to leave ; but most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had expected something different from him . " Look , we did our best , " he said . " We talked them into a lot of things I never thought they 'd give us . We pushed it as far as we could . But now we 've reached the point where they 're not going to give any more . It 's our turn to give in now . There 's nothing more we can do . Please , just go home . That 's what I 'm going to do . " He handed the mike back to its owner and started down the steps . Susan took his hand and walked with him . There was a kind of exhalation of purpose , a deflation , around them as the crowd started breaking up . Though one of the protesters from Madison tried to get things going again , the momentum was gone . People did n't talk much , or even look at each other , as they started to scatter . Halfway across the park , Susan whispered to Tom , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tom said . " I 'll come back and get it later . " She figured out his thinking then : the symbolic sight of them walking away toward home was the important thing right now . Do n't look back , she told herself . It would make her look hesitant , regretful . And yet , she wanted to . When they reached the edge of the park , she could n't help it , and glanced over her shoulder . The green space was almost empty , except for a little knot of diehards marching toward the highway to block the trucks . On the steps of Town Hall , Captain Groton was standing alone . But he was n't surveying the scene or the remaining protesters . He was looking after her . At the sight , Susan 's thoughts fled before a breathtaking rush of regret , and she nearly stumbled . " What is it ? " Tom said . " Nothing , " she answered . " It 's okay . " BY EVENING of the second day , it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been an insurrection ; the Wattesoon army was still fighting a pitched house-tohouse battle with resisters . In Walker , the soldiers had herded unruly inhabitants into overcrowded pens , and there had finally been a riot ; the casualty reports were still growing . Only in Okanoggan Falls had things gone smoothly and peacefully . The moving van had just pulled away from the Abernathy home with Tom and Nick following in the pickup , and Susan was making one last trip through the house to spot left-behind items , when her cell phone rang . Assuming it was Tom , she did n't look at the number before answering . " Susan . " She had not expected to hear his voice again . All the decisions had been made , the story was over . The Wattesoons had won . Okanoggan had fallen to its enemies . " Can you spare five minutes to meet me ? " he said . She started to say no , but the tug of disappointment made her realize there was still a bond between them . " Not here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Street . " Ben was in the back yard , taking an emotional leave of the only home he had known . Susan leaned out the back door and called , " I have to run into town for a second . I 'll pick you up in ten minutes . " Downtown , the streetlights had come on automatically as evening approached , giving a melancholy air to the empty street . The storefronts were empty , with signs saying things like " Closed For Good ( or Bad ) " tacked up in the windows . As Susan parked the car , the only other living things on Main Street were a crow scavenging for garbage , and Captain Groton , now sole commander of a ghost town . At first they did not speak . Side by side , they walked down the familiar street . Inside Meyer 's Drugstore , the rack where Susan had bought him a magazine was empty . They came to the spot where they had watched the Fourth of July parade , and Captain Groton reached out to touch the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Perhaps I was deceiving myself , but in the end I began to feel at ease among them . As if , given enough time , I might be happy here . " " It did n't stop you from destroying it , " Susan said . " No . I am used to destroying things I love . " If there had been self-pity in his voice she would have gotten angry ; but it was simply a statement . " Where will you go next ? " she asked . He hesitated . " I need to clear up some disputes related to this assignment . " Behind them a car door slammed , and Captain Groton cast a tense look over his shoulder . Following his gaze , Susan saw that a Wattesoon in a black uniform had emerged from a parked military vehicle and stood beside it , arms crossed , staring at them . " Your chauffeur is impatient . " " He is not my chauffeur . He is my guard . I have been placed under arrest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a dismissive gesture . " My superiors were dissatisfied with my strategy for completing my assignment . " Somehow , she guessed it was not the use of force he meant . " You mean .... " She gestured at his human body . " Yes . They felt they needed to take a stand , and refer the matter to a court-martial . " Susan realized that this was what he had wanted to tell her . " But you succeeded ! " she said . He gave an ironic smile . " You might argue that . But a larger principle is at stake . They feel we can not risk becoming those we conquer . It has happened over and over in our history . " " It happens to us , too , in our way , " Susan said . " I think your officers are fighting a universal law of conquest . " " Nevertheless , they look ahead and imagine Wattesoon children playing in the schoolyards of towns like this , indistinguishable from the humans . " Susan could picture it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to me , " he said . " Or to me . " The guard had finally lost his patience and started toward them . Susan took the captain 's hand tight in hers . " I 'm so sorry you will be punished for violating this taboo . " " I knew I was risking it all along , " he said , gripping her hand hard . " But still .... " His voice held a remarkable mix of Wattesoon resolution and human indignation . " It is unjust . " It was then she knew that , despite appearances , she had won .
