<p> Manoj Shyamalan ended his high school years with a dramatic statement . Editor of the 1988 yearbook , he ran a full-page replica of a Time magazine cover - featuring himself . The grinning teen stands in bow tie and cummerbund , his suspenders thumbed to the limit of their elasticity . The bold headline : " Best Director . NYU Grad Takes Hollywood By Storm . " <p> " It was kind of tongue-and-cheeky , " says the man now known as M. Night , sitting near the window of a Manhattan hotel room , the foliage of Central Park a tangled jungle below . He giggles at the memory . The March 1993 date on the mock cover alluded to Hollywood 's award season . " It was so outlandish , you know , that it was like a dream you throw out there . " <p> Mr. Shyamalan has yet to win an Oscar , though his 1999 breakthrough film , " The Sixth Sense , " was nominated for six Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Director . And he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , for Newsweek ) . But Shyamalan has indeed stormed the movie universe , becoming Hollywood 's highest-paid screenwriter , one of few directors who can open a blockbuster on the strength of his name alone - and , effectively , sole owner of the suspense genre . <p> His new film , " The Village , " opens Friday . Its cast includes two Oscar winners , Adrien Brody and William Hurt , not to mention Sigourney Weaver and Joaquin Phoenix . But on posters it is the **26;1308;TOOLONG name that looms above the title of a film that fits neatly into what has become the auteur 's standard fare : paranormal tales with Twilight Zone twists . <p> " He 's the star . M. Night Shyamalan has become a brand name , " says Paul Dergarabedian , president of Exhibitor Relations , a Los Angeles-based firm that tracks box-office trends . Mr. Dergarabedian points to the strong association between Shyamalan ( SHAH-ma-lawn ) and his major works : " Signs , " " Unbreakable , " and " The Sixth Sense . " " In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's his movie , " he says . " That 's enough to get people in . " <p> That power has led some in the media to dub him " the new Spielberg " or " the new Hitchcock . " But remarkably , this director , a first-generation American of Indian heritage , is no Hollywood insider . The 33-year-old millionaire has remained resolutely anchored - physically and artistically - to his hometown of Philadelphia . The city is the setting for all of his movies and the headquarters of Blinding Edge Pictures , his production company . <p> Cloistered there , away from the self-absorbed universe chronicled by People magazine , Shyamalan seeks inspiration for scripts with emotional themes - faith and family - that will resonate with ordinary moviegoers . <p> " I think he is genuinely interested in why and how people come to believe , " says David Thomson , author of " The New Biographical Dictionary of Film . " <p> Shy yet confident , mature yet childlike , precise yet open to ambiguity , Shymalan aims high . <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia Inquirer , " is to be average . " <p> On that score , say those who know him , he probably need n't fret . It became apparent early on that Manoj was no ordinary kid . He took in " Star Wars " at age seven , and that experience kicked him into creative overdrive . <p> His mother , an obstetrician at a Philadelphia hospital , once told an Indian newspaper that she came home one day soon after to find her son with a movie camera . <p> His explanation was simple : He had rented it with money he 'd borrowed from a friend 's mother . <p> Later that evening , Dr. Shyamalan drove Manoj to the store to return the equipment . When her son failed to emerge from the building , she got out of her car . <p> What she saw next caused her to burst out laughing . The store owner was picking coins out of a trash bag and counting them . The boy had cracked open his piggy-bank savings and lugged in $ 500 in quarters to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moviemaking , Shyamalan found the perfect escape from lulls of a quiet life in a wealthy suburb . His parents , both immigrant doctors who had moved to the US when their son was eight months old , were often away because of the demands of their practices . The young Manoj did n't find his sister much of a companion , either . She was six years older than he was . <p> " There was a lot of alone time in which to imagine , which is good , " he says now . " If I had a big brother who was a year older than me or something , I probably would n't have ended up being a filmmaker . " <p> Shyamalan took to making short films with uncommon brio . Using Halloween masks and kitchen gloves , he transformed radio-controlled cars into ketchup-dripping monsters . Visiting cousins were roped in as extras . The family dog , a docile German shepherd , became a very unconvincing version of Stephen King 's Cujo . <p> Shedding his shyness , Manoj soon befriended a neighbor , Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can see the genius in his filmmaking even back then , " says Mr. Rosenstein , now a manager in his family 's Philadelphia-based textile business . " I mean , he 's doing special editing , he 's doing parallel cutting , he 's editing in music . To think this is before we 're driving . " <p> By the age of 16 , Shyamalan had filmed 45 shorts . When he was n't making movies , he was watching them . Intently . There was n't a title in the action-adventure and horror sections of the video store that did n't pass through the home VCR . <p> Outings to see " Poltergeist , " " Raiders of the Lost Ark , " and " E.T . " left Shyamalan enraptured by Steven Spielberg . <p> Shyamalan 's parents were n't worried about raising a film geek . They were actively supportive of the hobby , his mom happily acting as caterer on the backyard movie sets . <p> No shut-in , Manoj had other interests , too - basketball and tennis , in particular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their son would go to medical school , as had nine doctors throughout the extended family . <p> The Shyamalans had primed their son for success , sending him to a Catholic grade school " for the discipline " and then to The Episcopal Academy ( motto : " Educating the whole child - Mind , Body , Spirit " ) , where the well-liked teen , renowned for his humor , graduated cum laude . <p> It was a major disappointment , Shyamalan says , when he told them he would study film at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University . <p> In a nod to his parents , the filmmaker did don a white coat for a cameo role as a doctor in " The Sixth Sense . " He has , in fact , cast himself in small speaking roles in each of his past four movies . <p> The director leaves other fingerprints on every reel of celluloid he produces . Look carefully in each film and you 'll spot a scene in which curtains flutter in the wind . Another Shyamalan signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then there are , of course , the trademark twist endings . <p> " The Sixth Sense , " about the relationship between an extraordinarily empathetic child ( Haley Joel Osment ) and a psychologist ( Bruce Willis ) floored moviegoers - many of whom went back for a second look - with its surprise revelation about Willis 's character . <p> The late-summer movie proceeded to streak to $ 293 million . It became a cultural phenomenon . ( Bart Simpson even scrawled the film 's most memorable line , " I see dead people , " on his detention-room chalkboard . ) <p> Shyamalan followed up with " Unbreakable " and " Signs . " The latter , a 2002 film about an alien invasion , grossed $ 228 million . <p> A handful of twisting , supernatural-themed imitators - " Gothika , " " What Lies Beneath , " " The Others " - were released by other studios . But it is Shyamalan , many observers say , who owns the genre today . <p> " If he had been a filmmaker whose natural instinct is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have achieved the same degree of box-office success , but I 'm not sure that he would be as well known to the public , " says Gregg Kilday , film editor of The Hollywood Reporter . " He 's kind of doing what Hitchcock did years ago , associating his name with a certain type of film . " <p> In Shyamalan 's universe , men are estranged from their family or wives , and children struggle to make sense of the adult world . <p> " It 's an area of storytelling that can easily be misinterpreted as horror , " says Mr. Thomson . But Shyamalan 's films , he adds , exhibit a certain warmth . <p> Not that the suspense does n't chill . <p> " People talk about the influence of Alfred Hitchcock all the time , " says Andrew O'Hehir , a writer and editor at Salon.com . " But most of the time that shows up as the very shallow sort of comparison . I think Shyamalan is unique in the sense that he understands that Hitchcock created a unique sort of film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera . " <p> If Shyamalan draws snipes , it is often for being a little too formulaic . A nation absorbed in the novel " The Da Vinci Code " has grown increasingly savvy about plot twists . And as popular as the approach has become , it may be predictable in its own way . <p> " At this point , anybody who goes to see one of Shyamalan 's movies , is waiting for ' OK , what 's the big narrative twist here ? ' " says Mr. O'Hehir . <p> Shyamalan bristles slightly at the charge . His hands , with numerous rings on each finger , fly as he mounts his defense . <p> " The reality is , right now , if I made ' The Sixth Sense , ' everyone would guess the ending , " he says . " So would I not make ' The Sixth Sense ' if I got that idea right now ? I mean , that would be sad . " <p> A big opening weekend seems all but assured for " The Village , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " set in the 19th century . But the film 's long-term success may well hinge on whether its serpentine twists manage to outfox the audience . <p> Shyamalan 's first brushes with failure would not occur until after he had blazed through film school , completing the four-year course in three years . <p> " There was never any self-doubt or procrastination , " recalls Lamar Sanders , a Tisch professor who says the prolific screenwriter had an uncanny flair for narrative . <p> Within months of graduating , Shyamalan - who had just adopted " Night " because people had struggled to pronounce Manoj - went to India to make a movie . <p> Shyamalan 's father loaned him $ 500,000 to make " Praying With Anger , " a full-length feature in which Night played an American Indian rediscovering his roots . <p> The 21-year-old mailed an unsolicited print to the 1992 Toronto film festival . It wowed the programmers . Though the film went on to win the American Film Institute 's award for best feature debut , it grossed only $ 7,000 . <p> What followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studios . And by this time , the stakes were higher for Shyamalan . He had met an Indian student , Bhavna Vaswani , at NYU and had slipped a note into her fortune cookie asking her to marry him . <p> The couple immediately began a family . Shyamalan soon had two daughters to feed . He was devastated when his first studio film , Miramax 's " Wide Awake , " earned just $ 300,000 . <p> " I 've seen many students in that situation , " says Mr. Sanders . " They frequently go off and lick their wounds for years and sometimes never reemerge , because their confidence has been destroyed . I ca n't imagine that happening to Night ... He was clearly not going to be stopped . " <p> Shyamalan 's ego , however , was bruised . He hints that it hurt when his family read the reviews . They still were n't fully convinced he 'd made the best career choice . <p> Shyamalan quickly decided to make the setback work for him . <p> " I was lucky enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Shyamalan . " That 's the greatest thing that could ever happen to you , because ... failure no longer holds any power over you . And now you can assess cleanly what you need to improve and what needs to be fixed . " <p> " The Sixth Sense " took 10 drafts to perfect . The discarded versions now hang framed in Shyamalan 's office as reminders of the value of perseverence . <p> The script fetched $ 3 million . Disney later paid him a staggering $ 5 million for " Signs " - with a bonus $ 7.5 million to direct it . <p> His position in Hollywood secure , Shyamalan passed up an opportunity to direct " Harry Potter . " He even turned down an offer from his enduring idol , Spielberg , to write " Indiana Jones IV , " so that he could concentrate on creating his own stories . <p> Remaining self-directed has also allowed Shyamalan to carve out time for his children and his parents , who still live nearby . This spring , when the cast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote part of rural Pennsylvania each night , Shyamalan would drive home to see his children . <p> One of his goals , he says , is to " make it like a job , like a regular job , so they feel like it 's a normal dad , having a normal life . " <p> Shyamalan , whose sophisticated GQ couture masks a child-like persona , enjoys the uncomplicated company of kids - and not only his own . <p> " Some of that comes from his wife . She has a heart for children , " says Pastor Steven Avinger , whose work to clean up his poor neighborhood for children inspired Shyamalan to quietly donate $ 1.5 million to the effort . <p> " The first shot of ' The Sixth Sense ' was done in that neighborhood , " says Shyamalan , who calls his gift " a little nudge . " " And so then this kind of four- , five- , six-block radius - this is our hope - will become a beacon , an example of other things we can do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Shyamalan Foundation , set up to help children , is the Greater Philadelphia Food Bank . When Shyamalan visited one of the program 's summer camps last year , Joan Mintz Ulmer was struck by how well he connected with the 35 children crammed into a hot church . <p> " What the children were most impressed with was that he had written the screenplay for ' Stuart Little , ' " says Ms. Ulmer , the food bank 's director of resource development . " He spent hours there , sat with every single child , and they put on little performances for him . He looked like he was having the best time . " <p> Others say his joy is also evident whenever Shyamalan is on the set . " He comes down and horses around with us on the set , " says Sigourney Weaver . " You would n't think he was a director and in charge of hundreds of people . " <p> It 's that puckish side of him that occasionally prompts him to appear on the " Howard Stern " radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rambling chat . Shyamalan also participated in a hoax documentary this month on the Sci Fi channel . Called " The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan , " it included a segment in which he appeared to storm off the set when an interviewer probed him about his fictional supernatural connection to a fictional deceased boy . <p> Shyamalan 's own inner 10-year-old still shoots hoops and opts for hamburgers over foie gras . The " E.T . " poster that used to hang on his bedroom wall now adorns his office , along with a picture of " Raiders of the Lost Ark " and a statue of Superman . <p> " There 's definitely a side of me that 's still that shy kid , " says Shyamalan . " If I let myself get into a certain uncomfortable situation , I can become like that . " <p> There is also a part of Shyamalan , though , that has always seemed preternaturally mature . Several colleagues and friends independently come up with the same description : an " old soul " in a young person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innate sense of order . His childhood room was so neat , says a friend , that even the tennis balls were piled in pyramids . In his hotel room , wearing a wrinkle-free cotton shirt , he gestures to the coffee table . He explains that he feels distracted because he still has n't finished autographing a pile of " Signs " DVDs . <p> That organized approach also means that he storyboards every scene in minute detail months before filming . The result : He knows exactly what he wants . That startling self-confidence could be mistaken for hubris . <p> But colleagues insist otherwise . He is often called a very sensitive and active listener , someone who allows co-workers time to work through creative mental processes he has already picked his way through . <p> " It 's not a Donald Trump situation , which is just a surface bravado , " maintains James Newton Howard , the composer who scored Shyamalan 's last four films . " It 's not a shallow kind of confidence , " he says . " There 's just so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I know this is going to be great . ' He 's just excited , it 's almost like a little kid . " A little kid with big thoughts . <p> Shyamalan 's spiritual beliefs are largely a mystery . In high school he was put off by the dogmatism he encountered . He told Time magazine in a 2000 interview that he recalled teachers saying that those who were n't baptized were condemned . <p> He was soon drawn to the beliefs of native Americans . During the past few years he has been practicing Kempo , a martial art with roots in Zen Buddhism . But he has also been profoundly influenced by his schooling in Christian theology , and by his family 's devotion to Hinduism . <p> The filmmaker 's father once gave him a tiny scroll of Sanskrit proverbs to remind him to stay grounded . It never leaves Shyamalan 's neck . <p> " One of the things with him that I was impressed about is that he has a great comfort in different cultural settings , because he 's worshiped with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist . <p> Shyamalan may not be the modern-day successor to Cecil B. DeMille , his epics laced with crowds , chariots , and Charlton Heston . But his characters grapple mightily with questions about the existence of God - especially after a tragedy . And , in most cases , they are rewarded with a sign that renews their faith . <p> Still , some film critics are less than satisfied with the conclusions that Shyamalan 's films draw . Mr. O'Hehir applauds the filmmaker for doing something Hollywood does n't do very often : tackling religious themes . But , he says , Shyamalan 's ideas on deep issues are too vague . <p> " It feels very much like supermarket spirituality to me , " says O'Hehir . <p> Shyamalan , naturally , has his own take . <p> " It 's something somewhat blurred in the line between believing in magic and believing in something spiritual , " he says . " That idea of faith is really cool ... And it 's a nice thing to keep saying , ' OK , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider one of Shyamalan 's future projects , an adaptation of the Booker Prize-winning novel " Life of Pi , " by Yann Martel . The book tells the story of an Indian boy who finds himself stuck in a lifeboat with a ravenous tiger after a freighter carrying zoo animals sinks . <p> " Shyamalan read it and , for fairly obvious reasons now , he was interested in doing it , " says Mr. Martel . " The novel starts in Pondicherry , where he was born . The character is simultaneously a Hindu , a Muslim , and a Christian . So there 's obviously a religious content to the novel . " <p> Like Shyamalan 's own serpentine plots , the novel unreels a series of revelations . " I argue that stories have a theology , " says Martel . " You must make a leap in faith and believe in stories and the truth of it will be decided later . " Shyamalan says he will make " Life of Pi " after his next movie , about which he remains secretive . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , at least , he 's not a grown-up version of the high school boy in that yearbook spoof . Success to Shyamalan now means building a body of work that is defined by its originality , singularity of accent , and voice . He wants to be more courageous , he says , just like the figure in the Blinding Edge film logo . <p> " It 's a man kind of leaping off a precipice into the light and having faith that there 's something in that light , " he says . " You 're not sure what 's going to happen to you and it seems almost dangerous but he takes the leap . There 's something drawing him , so he goes for it . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
