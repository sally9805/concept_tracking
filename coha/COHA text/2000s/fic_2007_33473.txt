Chapter One She really needed to get the ceiling patched . Shannon Murphy stared at the ugly crack running from one corner of her bedroom to the light fixture in the middle , only vaguely paying attention to the man diligently licking between her legs . His short , coarse hair irritated her inner thighs . He had a death grip on her buttocks that would surely leave bruises , and while he slurped and licked her pussy with enthusiasm , his tongue managed to miss her clitoris completely . Shannon tilted her hips , hoping Robert would take the hint and lick where it counted . That does n't sound right . Robert ? Richard ? Shit . She could n't remember his name . Whoever , he missed his cue . His tongue stabbed her pussy , then he sucked her labia between his lips . His slurping grew louder and his fingers tightened on her butt . Bruises . Definitely bruises . The ceiling caught Shannon 's attention again . Maybe she could talk the landlord into new paint ? A different color ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Not always . She really thought she 'd been ready for a change when Tia Mason moved out , but Shannon missed her friend . Badly . She glanced at the clock . Tia would have brought her to climax at least a couple times by now . Yeah , Shannon definitely missed Tia . What a strange phone call from Tia this afternoon ! So unlike her . Tia had n't mademuch sense , other than to scare the crap out of her , but Tia seemed to think Shannon might be in some kind of danger . Enough danger that a new acquaintance of Tia 's was on his way to Boston to protect her , a man who worked for Tia 's father , Ulrich Mason . Robert , or Richard , or whoever the hell he was , crawled up Shannon 's body and slobbered on first one breast , then the other . Shannon 's nipples did n't respond , even though he sucked and licked the flat , soft circles . Then he rammed his hard little latex-covered dick between her legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Dick ... and he 's ... Richard ! Shannon sighed with relief over the remembered name and lifted her hips , searching in vain for more penetration . There certainly was n't anything remotely big about the little pecker banging around inside her totally unaroused pussy . She wished he 'd hurry up and finish . He grunted like a pig , slamming his pelvis against her mound with each thrust . Shannon thought about faking an O , but she had to draw the line somewhere . Suddenly Richard 's body stiffened . He squealed . How the hell had she managed to bring home a guy who squealed ? Depression settled over Shannon , along with the full weight of the man who had n't turned her on enough to leave her wanting more of the same . She shoved his inert body aside and crawled out of bed . A stray thought flitted through her mind . She wondered about the guy headed to Boston and her apartment at this very moment . Hopefully he was younger than Tia 's dad ... young and sexy and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon glanced at the man in her bed and shuddered . " I 'm going to take a shower . I 'd really appreciate it if you 'd let yourself out before I 'm through . " Richard lifted his head and stared at her , obviously not comprehending . Shannon shoved her tangled hair back from her face . " This was a mistake , Richard . Take Big Dick and go home . Do n't come back . I 'm sorry . " She turned and walked into the bathroom , still muttering to herself . " Really , really , really sorry . " Jacob Trent glanced at the piece of paper in his hand and shoved it back in his pocket . He 'd thought about renting a car at Logan Airport , but the broad 's address was in Boston 's North End , land of no parking , so he looked for a cab instead . Let Luc Stone pick up the tab , along with the rest of the expenses , since the trip was obviously Luc 's idea . Right about now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake 's sorry ass away from Tia , the pack 's only bitch ... and Luc 's intended mate . Jake wished he could blame Luc for what was , without a doubt , the biggest fuck-up Jake had ever engineered in his life . He 'd been stewing about it all the way from San Francisco to Boston , wondering exactly why he 'd been chosen for this assignment . He 'd rather have gotten the details from Luc , not AJ . If Luc had been the one to call , it might have given Jake a chance to apologize . Obviously , Luc did n't want any part of him right now . Jake wished he knew , though , if this assignment was punishment or an honest job . He rubbed at the raw bite wound on his throat . It itched like a son of a bitch , which meant it must be healing , but the raw wound was a reminder of the really shitty thing Jake had done to his best friend . Make that , his best friend 's woman . Jake sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to fuck as wolf with the pack alpha 's bitch . Jake still could n't believe he 'd been so stupid , but for the first time in his life he 'd lost it . His Chanku side had gone totally out of control . Tia was just so damned hot . So ready , on her hands and knees in front of him , her pussy all wet and soft , her scent rising up and grabbing Jake by the balls until he 'd totally lost sight of who and where he was . Even now , almost three thousand miles away and possibly facing banishment from his pack , Jake still tasted Tia on his tongue , still felt the hot , wet pulsation as her clenching pussy grabbed his fingers . Jake 's body tightened with the memory . His nostrils flared . Then shame won out . His cock quieted . The air whooshed out of his lungs . Tia 'd been damned generous with her body , willing to take each man in the pack without hesitation . Only Jake had fucked things up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch her unaware with his wolven cock . Figuring in some convoluted corner of his horny brain that if he tied with Tia , if he took her as his mate while in wolven form , she 'd be his . She 'd bond with him , not Luc , and become Jake 's mate for life . Like it was that simple ? Like Tia did n't have a brain and feelings and was n't already head over heels in love with Lucien Stone ? Jake felt like a damned fool . He 'd risked everything to tie with the only female Chanku shapeshifter any of them had ever known . Fortunately , Tia had been faster and Luc 's aim was off , or Jake 's story would have been all she wrote . When Luc had shifted to wolf and gone for Jake 's throat , he 'd gotten a mouthful of fur along with his hunk of Jake 's flesh . Otherwise , Jake would n't be standing here at Logan Airport , looking for a cab . Feeling like a total jerk , remembering . Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shower , rubbed lotion over her arms and legs , then wrapped one fluffy towel around her dripping mass of hair and another around her body . She stepped out of the bathroom in a billowing cloud of steam . She was n't alone . " Richard , I meant it when I asked you to leave . " The man sitting with his back to her stood up . It was n't Richard . No , this man might have his hair cut military short like Richard 's , but there the resemblance ended . Tall and muscular , he filled her bedroom with menace . His eyes were hidden behind expensive dark glasses , his hands encased in black leather gloves . He radiated danger without saying a word . Tia 's frantic phone call slammed into Shannon 's mind . Was this Tia 's friend ? No . Nothing about this man felt right . Shannon took a step back , but strong arms caught her around the waist , lifted her off the ground . A leather clad hand clapped over her mouth . Shannon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Frantic , she twisted and bucked against his ironlike grip , kicking at jeans-covered shins with her bare feet . Her right hand came free . Shannon raked her fingernails along a sturdy forearm . " Son of a bitch . " The man shook her so hard her teeth rattled . Her towel fell off her hair , spilling down over her eyes , blinding her . The towel around her torso slipped and twisted around her body , tangling in the man 's gloved hands . Shannon tried to take advantage of her attacker 's compromised grip , but the first man grabbed her ankles and quickly taped them together . Still wriggling and twisting for all she was worth , Shannon was dumped unceremoniously on her belly on the rumpled bed . With two large men holding her down , she could barely move . One bound her hands tightly behind her back , almost dislocating her shoulders . Then he flipped her over , but before she could get a good look , another strip of tape went over her eyes . The last strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to breathe . Shannon sucked air through her nose . It was n't enough ! Panic gave her strength . She bucked and twisted her body as meaty , leather-clad hands grabbed for her . Still wet from her shower , skin slick from lotion , she slipped free of first one set of hands then the other . She was falling . Sliding off the edge of the bed amid curses and kicks , large hands grabbing at her slippery body with bruising strength , throwing her face down on the bed once more . Shannon could n't breathe , could n't see it coming . Had no way to prepare for the knee in the middle of her back and the sharp prick of a needle in her left buttock . Pain blossomed outward from the injection site . She saw stars and flashing lights behind the tape , then felt herself falling , as if from a very high point . Falling through thick wads of cotton , falling deeper and darker into oblivion . Jake paid the cabby and got out just down the street from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of identical structures . A couple of street lights had burned out , leaving the neighborhood bathed in shadow . He set his leather travel case down and checked the address on the slip of paper barely visible in the low light , then studied his surroundings . Streets in Boston 's North End were notoriously narrow , but this was little more than an alley . A large black sedan filled the entire lane in front of number twelve . Jake noted its presence , felt a shiver of anticipation along his spine . According to AJ , Ms. Shannon Murphy resided in a two bedroom apartment on the third floor . Jake knew Shannon had been Tia Mason 's roommate for almost ten years , but little else about her . If AJ was right , the woman was quite possibly in danger from the same crooked politician who had gone after Jake 's boss and Tia 's father , Ulrich Mason . AJ had n't told Jake precisely why Mason , and now Ms. Murphy , had been targeted , but he 'd dropped one tantalizing bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim chance , Shannon Murphy might carry Chanku genes . Unaware , unawakened , yet potentially Chanku , a shape-shifter just like Tia and the rest of the members of Pack Dynamics . That alone would have brought Jake to Boston . The fact she could be in danger because she might be Chanku made it imperative he come . Jake smiled grimly into the darkness as a huge weight lifted from his chest . He had n't really thought it through before . If Luc had chosen Jake for this assignment , maybe , just maybe , it meant he 'd found it in his heart to forgive his longtime friend . Thank God Ulrich was safe . Jake did n't know all the details , only that Ulrich had been kidnapped then rescued , all while Jake was racing around the woods of northern California , so fucked up he had n't known where to turn . While Jake 's packmates were busy saving their boss 's life , he 'd been trying to build up enough courage to go home with his tail tucked between his legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AJ 's call . Jake had grabbed this job like a lifeline , a chance to do something for the pack . The more he thought about it , the more Jake wanted to believe this was n't an assignment made in retribution , to get him away from Tia . He hoped like hell Luc had decided to give him a chance to atone for his unforgivable behavior . She might be Chanku . Or not . Hell . What a mess . If only he had a better feel for what Luc really wanted . Jake shoved the slip of paper into his pocket and pulled the collar of his leather coat up over his ears . He touched the bandage he 'd taped over the wound on his throat . The bloody scab looked a lot worse than it felt and he really did n't want to scare the woman half to death . He grabbed his bag and started forward , then stopped . Someone was coming down the stairs . Jake slipped back into the shadows and waited . Two men lugged a large canvas sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with something big and obviously heavy . Both men appeared well built , but they grunted with effort as they carried their load to the back of the sedan and set it carefully on the ground . It did n't take a genius to figure out what they had . Or who . Jake quickly stripped his coat off and slipped out of his shoes . He quietly unzipped his pants just enough to slide them down his legs . Cool air raised the hair across his thighs . One man opened the trunk , then turned to help the other lift the bag . They rolled it into the back and stared into the dark interior for a moment . Jake 's shirt and boxers landed quietly on the pile beside him . " You think there 's enough air ? " " Better be . We 're supposed to deliver the package alive and unharmed . " " The bitch is in better shape than I am . Did you see what she did to my arm ? " The first man laughed . He never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows aiming directly for the man 's throat . He went down , hard , his head bouncing off the cobblestones . The wolf spun around , his attack silent and deadly . The second man reached for his gun . The wolf took him down before he could pull the weapon from his shoulder holster . Like the first , this fellow hit the ground hard with the full weight of the beast bearing him to the rocky street . He landed hard with his arm trapped beneath his body . Panting , the wolf stood over him , glancing from one still body to the other , waiting to see if either man moved . Blood trickled from a head wound on the first man , but he appeared to be breathing . The second man 's arm had twisted at an awkward angle . He was unconscious as well , but still alive . Satisfied he was n't leaving two potential corpses behind , the wolf trotted back into the shadows . Within moments , Jake emerged fully dressed . He dragged both bodies behind a large trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys lay on the ground where the first man had fallen . Jake shoved them in his pocket and carefully opened the duffle bag . Even in the darkness she was beautiful , though still unconscious . There was no doubt in his mind this was the woman he 'd been sent to protect . Jake carefully pulled the tape off her eyes and mouth . It left darker marks against her pale skin . She was lean and long limbed and completely naked . Her fair skin gleamed in the low light . Already , dark bruises marred her arms and legs and spread across one hip . Her long hair hung in damp tangles . The woman 's captors had practically folded her in two to fit her into the bag . Jake pulled a knife out of his boot and sliced through the duct tape holding her arms and legs together , then slowly dragged her out of the bag . Her hair hung down in wet ribbons as he carried the woman around to the back door of the car . He opened the door and stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was tall and he had to bend her knees to make her fit . Slowly Jake ran his hands over her sleek body in search of injuries . She was warm , living satin beneath his fingers . His Chanku senses brought him the sound of each breath she took , the rush of blood through her veins , the slow but steady beat of her heart . He felt his awareness shift . She was no longer a victim to be protected . Jake touched warm , breathing woman , inhaled her freshly bathed scent and found her primal essence beneath the perfumed soap and body lotion . His body tightened as awareness blossomed into desire , as desire fed arousal . Suddenly , Jake 's fingers brushed over a hard lump on her left buttock , what felt like an injection site . He blinked , returning immediately to here and now , aware once again of the danger . (
