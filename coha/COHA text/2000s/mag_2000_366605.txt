If they were actors , which is n't an entirely mind-bending stretch , you could say George W. Bush has come to California to audition for a role as a moderate and John McCain is here to prove he can be a convincing conservative . And if there is any doubt about what 's at stake on March 7 , McCain flack Dan Schnur can clear it up in one sentence : " The winner of the California primary is going to be the Republican nominee for President . " <P> This reality had not yet dawned on what locals call the Southland last week . Trolling Orange and Riverside counties one day , I spotted only one piece of presidential paraphernalia  --  a Bush poster stapled to a telephone pole . At some point , one of these candidates is going to wise up and get involved in a car chase , which guarantees live coverage by every TV camera in L.A. and the rapt attention of the entire electorate . <P> During my sinking search for anyone acutely tuned in to the presidential primary , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Royce . " Ed , I 'm on the streets of Fullerton and ca n't find anything but YES ON PROP . 22 signs . " The only passion in California politics right now is wrapped up in a proposition that wants to make sure gays do n't walk the aisle . " Go to the Brea Community Center , " advised Royce , a Bush supporter . Republican women were gathering for their monthly meeting , he said , and they would definitely be plugged in . <P> Indeed . Some were even taking home campaign posters . But of the 70 women there , only a handful intended to vote for McCain . Upon hearing this , I committed a faux pas by suggesting McCain was in trouble if he could n't draw more support in such a working-class Republican community . " Do n't insult us , " snapped Manon Crow , a Bush supporter . " Brea is n't working class . " So much for the Bush spirit of reaching out to hoi polloi . <P> " Some of the ladies believed it was cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said of the Bush nomination . She excused herself to find a woman she had converted to her side , but returned with a face as long as a tire iron . " Can you believe it ? She says she 's not voting for McCain now because Democrats are voting for him . " <P> Privately , McCain insiders concede that Bush has already won strongly conservative communities such as Brea . They also admit that while McCain is a charmer in person , he 's a bit of a stiff on television , and in an ad-campaign state like California , that 's a problem . <P> But they still think they can whip Bush by taking San Francisco and San Diego as well as working-class areas like the Inland Empire of San Bernardino and Riverside counties , where you 've got more Costco Republicans than country-club Republicans . " It gets back to the one thing I learned at the feet of Nixon , " says McCain strategist Ken Kachigian . " It 's not the prose , it 's the poetry . " <P> Meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military glory , a promise to turn Animal House back into the White House and a guarantee to overthrow the government . Will it play ? Yes , says Riverside assemblyman Rod Pacheco , a Republican , and he 's a Bush supporter . <P> " We 're very independent-minded out here , where we 've got a majority of Republicans but elected a Democrat for Governor and U.S. Senator . That plays right to McCain , " says Pacheco , whose wife Becky is nullifying his vote . She 's for McCain.
