Introduction // To Shape a New World // // Malcolm X arrived in Harlem in the early 1950s on the heels of the contentious departure of another of its adopted , if little-known , sons . As Malcolm was bounding into Harlem ? s local political arena , Harold Cruse was settling downtown , still clinging to wistful dreams that he had , temporarily at least , put on hold . As a young boy , Harold Cruse dreamed of becoming a writer . For a southern-born black boy coming of age in the Great Depression , this was an ambitious goal , with long odds . Born in Petersburg , Virginia , in 1916 , Cruse moved as a young boy to New York City as part of the exodus to northern cities that would shortly transform African American life . The then-largest internal migration in American history sowed the seeds for Harlem ? s emergence as a cultural mecca that would become the headquarters for black political resistance , intellectual achievement , and cultural innovation . A second great migration , which started during the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier counterpart in both density and geographical breadth ) , extended to cities and regions recently buoyed by the movement for civil rights . Coalitions of civil rights activists , trade unionists , Communists , and Pan-Africanists led strategic campaigns for racial justice and radical democracy that stretched from gritty Harlem neighborhoods through Detroit ? s industrial shop floors to Dixie ? s cradle , Birmingham , Alabama , and out west to Oakland ? s postwar boomtown.1 // // Cruse ? s favorite time was spent reading books at the local library . It was no ordinary public library . Harlem was home to the New York Public Library ? s Negro History Division , a repository of black history and culture founded by the Afro-Puerto Rican bibliophile , historian , and curator Arturo Schomburg . Schomburg ? s passion for African , Caribbean , and African American history provided the residents of Harlem ? s black community a window onto its past.2 // // In the 1950s , black nationalists stalked Harlem like itinerant Baptist preachers in search of wayward flocks , wistful for the heady post-World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dose of militancy as effervescent as it was unprecedented . Marcus Mosiah Garvey ? s dynamic presence had fueled this golden age , when the Universal African Legions ( soldiers in Garvey ? s Universal Negro Improvement Association ) held Harlem captive with precision marching , ornate uniforms , and defiantly proud stares.3 No sooner had Garvey overcome what appeared to be insurmountable organizational , financial , and political obstacles than his movement collapsed , victimized by internal ineptitude , government surveillance , and jealous rivals . Garvey ? s arrest on charges of mail fraud , and subsequent incarceration during the mid-1920s , made room for other advocates of interracial class struggle who , during the height of the New Negro , could barely be heard above the din of nationalist fervor. // // If Garvey ? s absence created space for radicals , the Great Depression invited another front in the war for racial equality : class-based political agitation . With organizing energies fueled by social crises , the Communist Party ( CP ) made small , but surprisingly robust , headway in Harlem . While Garvey stoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s descendants , the CP offered a Promethean vision of class struggle . As Cruse remembered , anyone who couldn ? t debate the finer points of Marx and Engels was " considered a goddamned dummy ! " 4 // // By the late 1930s , the Depression introduced the possibilities of social , cultural , and political revolution at home and abroad and reached Harlem ? s street corners , barbershops , churches , and other institutions . Much of Cruse ? s early political education took place at the Harlem YMCA , which served as a debating society , intellectual training ground , and incubator for what Cruse later described as a hotbed of political activity . The all-black neighborhood blurred class distinctions among Afro-Americans , where Harlemites rubbed shoulders with leading black literary lights.5 Virtually every block of Harlem was up for grabs : nationalists exhorting on one corner , while Socialists and others set up their headquarters fifty yards away . Pamphlets on class struggle , Pan-Africanism , and trade unionism compressed decades of social history into easily digestible prose . Walking through parts of Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes giving away , propaganda that recounted the history of Negro oppression and offered a blueprint for black liberation . // // Fascism ? s triumphs in parts of Europe and Africa gave black Americans the opportunity to fight for freedoms abroad that they were denied at home . For blacks the fight against an overseas enemy lent urgency to domestic struggles for racial justice . Stationed in a supply company in Italy and North Africa , Cruse became friendly with Italian Communists . There were pragmatic reasons for such friendships . Preyed on by hijackers and other criminal elements , vulnerable black supply officers negotiated with the Italian Underground as a matter of professional survival and personal protection.6 // // Cruse returned home , more politically conscious and worldly , to a Harlem that had also matured . In fact , postwar New York City became a battleground for some of the most militant and cosmopolitan efforts to achieve racial equality in the United States , and Harlem was the movement ? s nerve center.7 For instance , seizing opportunities created by postwar momentum for progressive politics , the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the Council on African Affairs joined forces to promote a human rights platform for the nascent United Nations.8 Groups such as the National Negro Labor Congress and the Civil Rights Congress , as well as leading black intellectuals ( Paul Robeson , Richard Wright , and Langston Hughes among them ) , established relationships with Communists that ranged from dangerous flirtation to intimate association.9 Communists , through support of black criminal defendants , sharecroppers , trade unionists , artists , and writers , also played an important , hotly debated role among black activists during this period . Black sympathizers , not to mention members , viewed the CP as a potential vehicle for liberation , while anti-Communists suspected the group of playing African Americans for dupes ( a fear promoted by the federal government ) . The majority of black folk remained neutral , accepting the CP ? s support in certain instances of bald-faced racial injustice while never coming close to becoming professional members . In 1946 , Cruse officially joined the Communist Party . Like many in his generation , he entered radical politics at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of age amid its steady decline during the Cold War . // // From rural hamlets and small southern cities to giant urban metropolises , the black postwar generation challenged racial discrimination in industry , labor , housing , and domestic and foreign policy . Paul Robeson , the broad-shouldered Renaissance man who possessed the physique of a football player , the mind of an intellectual , and a sonorous bass voice that thrilled a global listening audience , emerged as the most popular spokesperson for black insurgency during the 1940s.10 // // Robeson ? s radicalism was rooted in his identification with underdogs of every race , color , and creed , an advocacy that found him proclaiming solidarity with indigenous people from Africa to the Soviet Union . Yet while leaders such as Robeson served as invaluable political mobilizers , a national black freedom movement was brokered , block by block , at the local level by far less glamorous figures.11 Ella Baker ( future founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ) , in her capacity as the NAACP ? s branch director , helped this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stressed cooperation with trade unions affiliated with the left-wing Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) .12 // // If the end of the war ushered in dramatic changes for black Americans , it also exposed enduring problems . Wartime race riots , most infamously Detroit ? s 1943 orgy of violence sparked by competition over jobs and housing , bared the enormity of the unresolved crisis . Rising expectations of black veterans met with racial violence , precarious employment opportunities , and a blatant defense of segregation that found local voice from Harlem to the Mississippi Delta to parts west and national representation among powerful Washington politicians . // // International events paralleled , and at times intersected with , postwar black freedom struggles ; events in Africa proved pivotal in this regard . The rapid decolonization of African states fostered domestic and international pan-African alliances , anchored by the stately presence of Afro-America ? s legendary intellectual propagandist W. E. B. Du Bois and the controversial outspokenness of Paul Robeson . Domestically , an assortment of militant organizations mirrored these developments , jointly promoting antiracism at home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes for racial justice in every facet of American life , though such hopes were offset by a presidential directive that established a hard peace through the threat of global war . The Truman Doctrine offered a picture of international , multiracial democracy that was , in theory , tantalizingly expansive . In practice , Truman ? s foreign policies created a domestic political order that sacrificed freedoms of speech and political association , not to mention agendas for racial and economic justice , at the altar of what he proclaimed to be a larger evil  --  Communist totalitarianism . Remnants of the black freedom struggle responded in different ways to the Cold War ? s assault on the civil liberties of black radicals . Robeson and Du Bois held steadfast in their commitment to Socialism and paid the price in legal troubles and tarnished reputations . Other , less stalwart , fellow travelers turned government collaborators , informing on ex-comrades . The NAACP navigated the political storms by turning inward , withdrawing from the postwar black liberal-left alliance and opting instead for a more narrow description of racial justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans would enjoy new rights , yet more freedoms remained to be claimed ; it was the space between new rights and unclaimed freedoms that would fuel Black Power activists . In 1953 , amid setbacks for radicals of all stripes and after less than a decade as a Communist , Harold Cruse left the CP . He was not alone . Like his more famous contemporaries , Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison , Cruse grew skeptical of the CP ? s capacity to lead a political revolution . Indeed , the Communist Party ? s Depression-era eloquence on race matters  --  exemplified by its vigorous attacks on segregation as well as the " black belt " thesis that allowed " Negro self-determination , " or black nationalism , to penetrate Communist ideology  --  sagged in subsequent decades , weighed down by an almost evangelical sectarianism.15 Ex-Communists and former radicals responded to the CP ? s ideological zigzags in different ways , with Ellison embracing American universalism , despite America ? s stubborn resistance to black inclusion , while Wright searched , until his premature death , for new revolutionary ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determination , unity , and the cultural politics of race  --  that retained the international awareness he first witnessed on Harlem street corners , read about at the New York Public Library , and experienced through service in World War II and , ironically , the Communist Party . Cruse ? s disappointment with Communism could be seen in bitter personal relationships with Harlem ? s leading literary figures , such as Lorraine Hansberry , as well as in his own failures in the field of arts and letters . Operating in social and cultural arenas that claimed pride in an older style of black activism , while at the same time searching for new political horizons , Cruse would be both a participant and a critic of Black Power politics . In his 1967 manifesto , The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual , he charged white Communists and black radicals with failing to recognize that the key to African American liberation resided in the last place anybody cared to look : in the black community ? s indigenous , cultural , and artistic institutions . // // The April 1955 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide hope for black radicals burned by the Cold War ? s scalding political climate . Paul Robeson , in his fifth year of domestic confinement after federal authorities stripped him of his passport , greeted the conference as a symbol of the kind of politics  --  of radical anticolonialism and self-determination  --  that furthered the commitment to human rights and freedom of expression that was his life ? s work.16 Presided over by Indonesian president Sukarno and convened by the prime ministers of Indonesia , India , Burma , Ceylon , and Pakistan , the conference featured representatives of twenty-nine nonwhite nations whose populations together exceeded one billion . Bandung ? s declarations against racism , colonialism , and imperialism represented a watershed event : a " third bloc " opposing both capitalism and totalitarianism . The conference marked the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement , which defied the political requirement that even the tiniest country swear allegiance to the United States or to the Soviet Union . Neutrality , however , had its cost . Behind the scenes in Washington , the State Department observed the entire proceeding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this far corner of the world.17 // // // In the United States one modest , but powerful , act of political dissent coincided with the radicalism that Bandung expressed in bold strokes . In 1955 , the same year as Bandung , Martin Luther King Jr . emerged as the young leader of the Montgomery , Alabama , bus boycott . Coupled with 1954 ? s Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation decision , the 1950s would then be christened as the start of the modern civil rights era.18 // // While black southern laborers , preachers , and college students stood poised on the edge of history ( destined to be regarded , for the most part , as bit players in an unfolding historical drama ; character actors overwhelmed by the glamorous star power and transcendent appeal of Martin Luther King Jr . and John F. Kennedy ) , 19 participants in the black freedom struggle reinvented themselves as political figures , cultural doyens , magazine editors , and , at times , reform-minded civil rights activists . // // In the 1950s , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , such as the members of the Harlem Writers Guild , formed relationships with Malcolm X. On the surface it was an unlikely alliance , since Malcolm represented a religious group  --  the Nation of Islam  --  that eschewed political involvement , going so far as to discourage its members from voting , marching on picket lines , or participating in boycotts . Yet Malcolm ? s personal biography and political history made him attractive to activists seeking renewed faith in radical politics . A former Pullman porter turned full-time hustler during the 1940s , Malcolm resided on the fringes of the postwar freedom surge . By the mid-1950s , however , he was an ex-convict turned local activist , an emerging national figure in a transformed political landscape . Malcolm ? s short stints as a laborer and longer residence in the bowels of black urban America shaped his political activism . In a relatively brief career that would be noted for its envelope-pushing militancy , Malcolm boldly confronted democracy ? s jagged edges , vociferously arguing that the goals of integration fell far short of complete equality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political revolution . Malcolm ? s radicalism , most often recognized as the prophetic prelude to the fiery black awakening of the 1960s , took initial shape during the 1950s against the backdrop of southern civil rights insurgency and Bandung . For Malcolm , links between the local and the international were self-evident , only their programmatic implications remained frustratingly unclear . Over the course of the next decade , Malcolm X , the once-wayward son of a slain Garveyite preacher , would make it his mission to find  --  and institute  --  an unprecedented revolutionary politics as part of a quest for black power that would take him from jam-packed Harlem street corners and Los Angeles mosques to British universities , Middle East pilgrimages , and African kingdoms.20 // //
