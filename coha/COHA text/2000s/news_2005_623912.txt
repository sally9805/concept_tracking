<p> ' Fidelio ' a better pick than ' Atomic ' <p> Editor  --  Perhaps The Chronicle could have two Opera reviewers , one for the cognoscenti and one for the general public ( " ' Fidelio ' holds you captive ... but not in a good way , " Nov. 11 ) . <p> While I appreciate Joshua Kosman 's reasons for not liking " Fidelio , " we found it to be one of the best operas of the year both musically and production-wise , and perhaps more importantly , much in tune with what most operagoers expect . It would be an artistic crime if people are deterred from seeing " Fidelio " by Kosman and at the same time encouraged to see " Dr. Atomic "  --  a disaster for most of us . <p> HANK WEINER <p> Oakland <p>  --  Morford 's attack on O'Reilly inaccurate <p> Editor  --  Not that Mark Morford is interested in journalistic integrity , intellectual honesty or performing the daunting research into an event that occurred a whole week before his Nov. 16 article ( " Bill O'Reilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? " ) , but , for what it 's worth , O'Reilly did n't say , " essentially , " that San Francisco should be bombed ; he said that if it was , the United States should n't send in troops to help . <p> Maybe Morford thinks the word essentially is his escape clause . As in , a box is " essentially " round ; a cat is " essentially " a dog ; or Morford is " essentially " telling the truth . <p> Even more interesting is that he thinks Satan is readying a room for old Bill in the hot place , a statement that would seem to imply that Morford believes in some form of a Christian God . This is , of course , laughable , but then maybe he " essentially " believes in God only when he is desirous of damning someone to hell . <p> PAUL MCGRATH <p> Cameron Park  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Reading Mark Morford 's hypocritical Nov. 16 article made my stomach turn . <p> Morford likens himself to " Shiva " looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call Bill O'Reilly a " self-aggrandizing blowhard . " Morford portrays O'Reilly as being " like Pat Robertson ranting about how gays caused the attacks of Sept. 11 . " Yet O'Reilly has openly criticized Robertson on this very point . <p> Want to promote higher education for all ? Me , too . Opposed to the Iraq war ? Me , too . Want every city but your own to foot the human cost of this and future war efforts ? You 're a deserter . <p> San Francisco 's Proposition I seeks to end military recruitment at public high schools , without proposing an alternative recruitment plan . I guess the rest of the country will have to fill the vacancies for San Francisco . Face it , " College Not Combat " is a selfish , cowardly and shameful attempt by the city to weasel out of its obligation to our country . <p> ERIK ANDERSEN <p> Albany <p> Military shunned until crisis strikes the city <p> Editor  --  I am a native San Franciscan , raised in Cow Hollow and working part time for the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill O'Reilly 's satirical remarks very seriously ( Nov. 17 ) . Maybe there is hope . <p> I watched " The O'Reilly Factor " recently , and his remarks were directed toward the citizens of San Francisco who voted not to allow military recruiters into the schools . <p> What the citizens are saying is , " You ca n't recruit here , but we want your protection . " Only in screwball San Francisco . <p> During the ' 89 earthquake , if it were not for the Navy , the city would have been blacked out for at least another day . The Lang supplied the steam to the Potrero power plant to heat the water to get the unit faster back on line . I know ; I was the operating foreman ( PG &E,; now retired ) . <p> If there is another catastrophe in the city , the military will be needed . But because of the anti-military left-wing politicians , there is no more military in the immediate Bay Area . <p> JOHN COCKREHAM <p> San Mateo <p>  --  Amused by Selvin 's jabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry at him , I now am merely amused by Joel Selvin 's attempts to review and criticize Paul McCartney ( " Sir Paul gracefully wears the crown that comes with being an ex-Beatle , " Nov. 9 ) . <p> His bias is not only petty , but extremely unprofessional . He tries to frame his recent review of McCartney 's San Jose show in warm , fuzzy ways , but his bias shows through glaringly in the second half of the review . McCartney did not " brush off " his solo career . In fact it was prominently displayed and absorbed with as equal admiration by the crowd as his Beatle tunes were . His voice was absolutely amazing , especially considering that this 63-year-old is on the last leg of a 37-city U.S. tour , and sings nonstop for 21/2 hours every night ! Selvin claims that Paul is " clearly not a natural entertainer . " <p> But the biggest gripe I have with the review is aimed not at Selvin but at the editor who came up with the headline , " A little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line comparing Paul 's waving of the American flag to Newton , and the comparison makes the headline ? <p> STEFAN WEVER <p> San Francisco <p> New de Young tower has time on its side <p> Editor  --  Please add my name to the growing list of dissenters who dislike the new de Young 's " observation tower " ( Letters to Datebook , Nov. 11 ) . It looks like a monolith rising out of the jungles of Guatemala , which might fit in  --  artistically speaking  --  in the jungles of Guatemala , but not in Golden Gate Park . <p> On the other hand , there were detractors , too , to the Transamerica 's Pyramid in downtown San Francisco . Since then , we 've all come around to liking the design and it 's seen as a uniquely San Francisco landmark . Maybe , given enough time , the new de Young Museum will be seen the same way . <p> DAVID HAWZ-MEN <p> San Francisco <p> Rolling Stones revered and reviled <p> Editor  --  I enjoyed Joel Selvin 's incisive and vibrant review of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mick Jagger digs deep into his vocals , and the Stones find another way to be the greatest rock ' n ' roll band , " Nov. 15 ) . I also agree that the Stones probably are inspired by the productive musical longevity of one of their idols , Muddy Waters . <p> Alas , Waters did not play into his 70s , as Selvin wrote . He died in 1983 at age 68 . Having had the pleasure of seeing him a year or so before he died , I can confirm that his singing and musicianship remained unparalleled  --  as did his flirting with the ladies in the audience . Mick &; Co. have a good role model . <p> TOM MAURIELLO <p> San Rafael  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Mick Jagger and friends are simply poetry in motion . They have a tremendous presence on stage : such grace , such charm . They truly are the greatest rock ' n ' roll band in the world . <p> This was my 18th Stones concert , and it was just as fantastic as the first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Thanks for the great photo of Mick . <p> LORI DADAMIO <p> Walnut Creek  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Notwithstanding that they are still capable of a good live performance , I do n't think the Rolling Stones are even a shadow of what they were from 1964 to 1972 . The band is old , and its current releases are just a rehash of albums from the 1980-2000 period , most of which are forgettable . There have been some exceptions : " Steel Wheels " ( 1989 ) and " Tattoo You " ( 1981 ) , but in parts only . And yes , 1978 's " Some Girls " was about their best album since 1972 , the end of the Stones ' era . <p> The Stones are now past it and have been for many years . They have become a curiosity , a self-parody . They should retire . Mick Jagger looks every bit his age of 62 and has taken on a singularly grotesque appearance  --  downright scary . Someone should tell him to lose the hairstyle , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at least he makes no pretense of being anything else . He looks nothing remotely similar to his old self . Charlie Watts is the genuine element of the band and might live another couple of years as he just had major surgery for throat cancer , followed by chemo ( not a good sign ) . <p> Ron Wood was never a lead guitarist . The band 's entire sound changed for the worse when Brian Jones died . The period when Mick Taylor played lead had some gems , like " Time Waits for No One , " but even that track was anything but a blues number ( the band 's trademark ) as junk like " Angie " was . Bill Wyman , who celebrated his 69th birthday Oct. 24 , was wise to retire after the 1989 tour . <p> I think John Lennon was right when he said that he did n't want to be Elvis Beatle and be performing " I Saw Her Standing There " at age 50-plus . <p> I heard the latest Stones release , " A Bigger Bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bang ? )  --  and it 's somewhere between " Some Girls " and " Tattoo You " and not more than ordinary . It was released in mid-September 2005 and fell out of the Top 20 within two weeks . <p> The Rolling Stones have done their thing and were the best rock ' n ' roll band I have ever seen and heard , with that unique image and sound from brilliant albums like " 12 x 5 , " " Aftermath , " " Beggar 's Banquet " and " Sticky Fingers . " That 's over now and has been for many years . And this is coming from someone who took Andrew Loog Oldham 's suggestion on " The Rolling Stones Now ! " to heart , and made the band a way of life for years . <p> But it 's 2005 now , not 1968 , and the Rolling Stones are in their 60s . And ladies and gentlemen , 60 ca n't be 28 no matter how much makeup you use and how dark you color your hair . <p> NICHOLAS DUKA @ @
