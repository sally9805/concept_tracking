Gore House , Kensington <br> London Seat of the Duke of Beaumont <br> February 21 , 1784 <p> " He 's a virgin . " <p> " What ! " <p> " He 's a virgin and  --  " <p> " Your husband is a virgin ? " <p> " And he wo n't bed me . " <p> Jemma , Duchess of Beaumont , sank into a chair with a look of almost comical dismay on her face . " Darling , if there ever were grounds for annulment , these are they . Or this is it , " she added with some confusion . " Is he some sort of monk ? " <p> Isidore shook her head . " Not that I 'm able to see . He says he will bed me eventually  --  just not until we 're married . " <p> " But you are married ! " <p> " Exactly . I may call myself Lady Del'Fino , but the truth of the matter is that in the eyes of the law , I 'm Duchess of Cosway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've been married for eleven years , last I counted . And it 's hardly my fault that my husband is still a virgin . If he had n't been chasing all over Africa looking for the source of the Blue Nile , we could be utterly bored with each other , like other wellbred English couples . " <p> Jemma blinked at her . " It 's unbelievable . Un-believable . " <p> " I spent the last seven years fending off lechers in every court in Europe , waiting for him to return home , and what does he do ? Decide we 're not truly married . " <p> " So why did n't he fall directly into your bed , virgin or no ? " <p> Isidore glanced at herself in Jemma 's glass . Men had lusted for her ever since she turned sixteen , and the particulars had n't changed : black hair , pale skin , generous bosom . In short , something short of Venus , but delectable enough to send most men into a lustful frenzy . <p> " One has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jemma continued , " and you have such a deliciously un-English look about you . Your eyes are a gorgeous shape , not like the little raisins most of us have . " <p> " I do n't think of myself as exotic , " Isidore said , " and more to the point , he seems to want someone more skilled in a domestic capacity . Not more than ten minutes after we met  --  for the first time !  --  he inquired whether I had been doing any weaving lately . Weaving ? Was I supposed to whip out a spindle and sew a fine seam ? " <p> " Even I know that one does n't sew with a spindle , which implies that Cosway has a gross disappointment in store if he 's counting on your domestic skills , " Jemma said , laughing . " Perhaps he 's the type that babbles when faced by a desirable woman . It 's a surprisingly common affliction . " <p> " Believe me , I was watching him closely , and he gave no sign of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hardly notes anything outside the House of Lords , told me after my masquerade that you had the most beautiful mouth of any woman in England . " <p> " Beaumont said that ? " Isidore said , feeling a little thrill of pleasure . " That 's nice . Though I have to say , Jemma , I should n't like my husband to praise other women to my face . " <p> Jemma shrugged . " According to your own assessment , as a well-bred English couple , we are merely adhering to type . I do n't think you should panic , Isidore . I expect Cosway is madly attracted to you and he 's just conveying his deep respect by holding a ceremony in front of a bishop . " <p> " He 's deranged , " Isidore said flatly . " It must have been all that sun in Africa . We married by proxy , but it was still a marriage . I was only twelve years old , but I remember it perfectly well . " <p> " Well , " Jemma said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony now that he 's returned . " <p> " And maybe he 's utterly mad and bizarre , " Isidore said , putting her fear into words . " What sort of man stays a virgin until he 's near to thirty ? That 's almost disgusting . How am I supposed to introduce him to the bedroom , Jemma ? Men do this sort of thing on their own . Honestly , if he 's never used his equipment  --  well , who 's to say that it will function at all ? " <p> Silence answered her . <p> Isidore could feel her eyes growing hot . " I just want to have my husband go to bed with me so that I can be a proper duchess , use my title , and have a child . Is that too much to ask ? " <p> Jemma reached over and took one of her hands . " No . I 'm sorry , darling . " <p> Tears started sliding down Isidore 's cheeks . " I was never unfaithful to Cosway . The Comte de Salmont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more delicious than a 1764 cognac , and given his cellars , that was a true compliment . I finally returned to Italy because Salmont was so extravagant in his pursuit , but I did n't sleep with him , even when he threatened to kill himself . " She sniffed , and Jemma handed her a handkerchief . <p> " I kept to my part of the bargain , although any woman in her right mind would expect her husband to show himself when she came of age . " <p> " Childhood marriages are a huge mistake , " Jemma said . " I shall never allow Beaumont to arrange one for a child of ours . People should be adults when they marry . " <p> " I 'm not fussy . Truly I 'm not . I may have flirted with men as handsome as Salmont , but I like men of other types too . Even short ones . I 've told myself for years that no matter how Cosway looked when he finally staggered out of the jungle , I would do my marital part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he unacceptable ? " Jemma asked with some curiosity . <p> " Oh , oh  --  no , " Isidore said . " That 's not the point . His looks are irrelevant . He 's manifestly odd . Odd ! " <p> " I have another idea . Perhaps Cosway is just too intelligent to have interested himself in carnal matters . " <p> Isidore gave her a watery smile . " Show me the man who 's too intelligent to use his tool , and I 'll show you a dunce . " The words came out more harshly than she intended . <p> " The most obvious explanation is that he 's following some sort of religious law . Did he say anything about going to church ? Likely he 's a Puritan . Are n't they terrifyingly severe when it comes to base appetites ? " <p> <br> Continues ...
