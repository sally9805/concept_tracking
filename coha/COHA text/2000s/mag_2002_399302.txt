Eric Simonson rests on Everest 's East Rongbuk Glacier , where his team found its first clue that related to lost Everest pioneers George Mallory and Sandy Irvine . // Before Eric Simonson made history atop the world on a mountain called Everest , he climbed in Scouting to become an Eagle . This time , nothing would keep Eric Simonson from the top of Mount Everest . Twice before , the mountain had defeated him . In 1987 , during his second attempt , he thought long and hard before turning around with the 29,035-foot summit less than 300 feet above . He and his partner had run out of rope . While he was pretty sure he could make it up , descending without a safety line was another matter . He was n't interested in a one-way trip . Now , four years later , things were different . Climbers before him had sacrificed fingers , toes and sometimes their lives . Simonson knew that he too had reached that point at which men desperate for the top have taken off gloves and boots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh solid . " I was very , very determined to make the summit , " he recalls . " Maybe I would have taken my gloves off . I do n't think I 've ever felt quite that way before or since then . " That 's what the world 's highest mountain will do to a man , especially on the upper slopes known as the Death Zone , a place where scarce oxygen forces climbers to bring their own supply . Blinding storms sneak up suddenly . Simonson reached the summit with fingers and toes intact that day in 1991 . He could n't know that an even greater challenge lay ahead . So determined was Simonson that he barely paused when he found an old oxygen tank about 1,000 feet below the summit . " I picked up the bottle and said , Huh , that 's an old bottle , ' and I pitched it , " he says . " All you want to do is get to the top . I decided it was too heavy to carry . After I got home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Mount Everest-yet . Simonson prepares for a 1965 Scout outing . // Simonson had stumbled across a clue in one of mountaineering 's most enduring mysteries . The bottle was from a 1924 British expedition . No one knows whether George Leigh Mallory and his companion Andrew Irvine made it to the top-most deaths on Everest occur during descent-and no one knows how they died ( see " Everest Pioneers " ) . The two climbers vanished into clouds within a few hours of the summit , the closest any human had come to the top of the world . No one climbed as high again until 1953 , when Everest was conquered by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay , a native of Nepal , where Everest is located . In 1999 , Simonson returned to Everest to search for Mallory and Irvine and solve the mystery . Roots of Adventure Growing up in Tacoma , Wash. , Simonson had plenty of role models . The state is renowned for its worldclass mountaineers-Jim Whittaker , the first American to climb Everest , in 1963 , lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home . Simonson was a beginning backpacker when his father took him to a lecture by Whittaker . Simonson 's dream was born as he listened to Whittaker , an Eagle Scout , and others from his team describe their adventures . " I 'll never forget it , " Simonson says . " I was 10 years old . I got books at the library about the history of Everest . " Simonson joined Scouting a year later . It proved the perfect bridge between family camping trips and brutal climbs above treeline . " Scouting really provided an opportunity to take that next step , " he says . " We tried to do a camp-out every month . In Washington State , that can get grim . I can remember some wet , rainy days in February . " " Basically , " recalls boyhood friend Alan Billingsley , " every single weekend , he and I and another friend went hiking and climbing . " Billingsley , who joined Scouts with Simonson , presented him with the Distinguished Eagle Award during the 2001 National Scout Jamboree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a Scout . " I did n't feel like I hurried , " he says . " Once you get involved in something , you want to keep moving . " All the Wrong Moves Simonson climbed his first mountain when he was 15 . At 14,410 feet , Mount Rainier is the tallest mountain in Washington and no cinch for anyone . " I puked two times on the way up , " Simonson recalls . " When we finished , I went into a full body cramp . I basically did everything wrong . I was not eating enough . I was not drinking enough water . I hung in there , but that taught me something : When you go out all day long , you 've got to be aware of where your gas gauge is . " The agony was worth it . More than 30 years later , he sports a big grin when recalling that first climb to a mountaintop . " I was very happy , " he says . " Very proud and very happy . It does n't subside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me long after . That really fired my imagination to go and do more . " Learning by Experience Mountaineering may seem a lonely pursuit , but Simonson loves Photograph Everest Pioneers George Leigh Mallory ( below , right ) did not know Andrew " Sandy " Irvine ( left ) when their fateful expedition began and the photo below was taken in 1924 , but they soon became friends . They were less than 1,000 feet from success and making steady progress when a fellow climber who stayed behind at high camp last saw them . Thanks to an expedition led by Eric Simonson , the world learned that Mallory died after breaking a leg in a fall . He was found facedown on a steep slope with his arms stretched above him . His fingers were dug into loose rock , as if trying to pull himself to the summit . Irvine was never found , nor his camera ever recovered . No one knows if they made it to Everest 's summit . // the camaraderie . " You can learn more about somebody going out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can in years in the city , " he says . " The stressful environment really brings out people 's true nature . I have n't seen it all , but I 've seen a lot . " Including death . During Simonson 's first Everest trip in 1982 , fellow climber Marty Hoey plunged off the mountain 's north face , never to be seen again . Nonetheless , the team , led by Lou Whittaker ( Jim 's twin , and one-time Star Scout ) , pressed on . But Everest proved too tough . " That was a real blow , " Simonson says . " Marty was a close friend to all of us on the team . I basically hit the switch and did not grieve . I did grieve later-it was about a week later that it really hit me . Climbing really makes you appreciate your friends more . You ca n't take your friends for granted . Or life itself . " At 47 , Simonson is more careful than ever , especially since the birth of his first child two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To be perfectly honest , I would n't want to , " he says . " Life would be pretty boring if we were always 100 percent safe . The point is , you want to be smart about it . " Being afraid is part of the game . Better to worry before crossing an avalanche zone than panic halfway across when the slope slides . " I like to think fear 's your insurance policy , " he says . " There 's a difference between fear that paralyzes you , which is bad , and fear that makes you think . " Solving Mysteries , Saving Lives As a guide , Simonson roams the world climbing peaks . In 1999 , he led an expedition in search of truth : He returned to Everest to find Mallory . Photograph ERIC SIMONSON AT A GLANCE BORN : March 13 , 1955 , Evanston , III . LIVES : Tacoma , Wash .

CLIMBING HIGHLIGHTS : Led 85 expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every continent , including one summit each of Asia 's Mount Everest ( 29,035 feet ; world 's highest ) and Cho Oyu ( 26,906 feet ) ; 16 times atop Alaska 's Mount McKinley ( 20,320 feet ; North America 's highest ) ; three times up Antarctica 's Mount Vinson Massif ( 16,860 feet ) ; 17 summits of Africa 's Mount Kilimanjaro ( 19,339 feet ) , and 271 times up Washington State 's Mount Rainier ( 14,410 feet ) . Simonson has co-written two books , both published by The Mountaineer Books . " Ghosts of Everest : The Search for Mallory and Irvine , " published in 1999 , is the official team book about the expedition that found Mallory 's body . The book gives historical details about Mallory 's 1924 and previous expeditions along with stunning photographs of Mallory 's remains , which the team buried on Everest . " Detectives on Everest : The 2001 Mallory &; Irvine Research Expedition , " published in August 2002 , recounts the expedition 's return to Everest in 2001 trying to answer-Did Mallory and Irvine make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The expedition found the site where Mallory and Irvine spent their last night at 27,600 feet . The writers interweave the story of the 1924 expedition with that of the 2001 expedition , giving the reader an appreciation for the dangers mountaineers on Everest have always faced . // " The big motivator for me was this was a mystery for 75 years , " he says . " Did they make the summit ? Did they not make the summit ? " Climbers who disappear on Everest , or those found near death on the upper reaches , are usually left alone . But this was different . " It 's for the sake of history , trying to find the truth , " Simonson says . " I think Mallory and Irvine would have wanted us to find out . What made that trip so satisfying was so many people gave us zero chance . " Simonson 's expedition found Mallory 's body on the first day of searching . Part of the mystery was solved : Mallory died in a fall . Searchers also found the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his team returned in 2001 to look for Irvine and the camera he carried . The team found neither , but they accomplished something more important . Five climbers had been forced to spend the night without tents in the Death Zone . Other climbers trying for the top did n't stop to help . But Simonson , leading his team via radio , rescued the five , who they found could barely move . " The consensus of all of us , including myself , is you ca n't just walk past them , " Simonson says . " You 've got to try . " Four of the five stricken climbers survived . And so does the mystery of Mallory . Was he first to stand atop the world ? Simonson is n't sure whether he 'll return to Everest to find out , but he 's not disappointed . After so many years , Simonson has learned a different definition of success . " It 's not about making it to the summit , " he says . " It 's about taking a shot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's tallest mountain is known as Chomolungma , or Mother Goddess of the World . To others , it is Mount Everest , named in 1865 after British surveyor Sir George Everest , who helped map India . Located in Asia on the border between Tibet and Nepal , Mount Everest continues growing at the rate of a few millimeters a year . These days , it 's not unusual for a hundred or more climbers to scale Everest each year . But the mountain remains dangerous . More than 1,300 climbers have summited , but more than 160 have perished in the attempt . Thirteen climbers died in four expeditions before Everest was finally conquered in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay of Nepal . // <p>
