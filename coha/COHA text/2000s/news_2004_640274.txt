<p> In August 1990 , the Houston Astros traded veteran pitcher Larry Andersen to the Boston Red Sox for a minor-league first baseman named Jeff Bagwell . Now , nearly 14 years later , Andersen is a broadcaster in Philadelphia and Bagwell is putting the finishing touches on what is looking more and more like a Hall of Fame career . Starting Tuesday , the Astros and Chicago Cubs square off for the first time this season in a two-game series at Minute Maid Park in Houston . Two days later , Bagwell turns 36 . Before he does , he stepped into our batter 's box for some extra cuts . Adam Schefter : Which Cubs pitcher is the most difficult for you to hit ? Jeff Bagwell : For me , Kerry Wood . When he is on , he is the toughest because his stuff is overpowering . Even his breaking ball is overpowering . There 's not many pitchers you can say that about . I had a tough time with Carlos Zambrano last year . I mean , you can go down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tough . But when Kerry Wood is on , he 's the toughest . AS : Which pitcher in baseball gives you the most trouble ? JB : You 're probably not going to believe this , but Scott Sullivan . Yeah , you probably do n't even know the name . Lots of my teammates , they do n't even know the name . That 's my man . AS : Scott Sullivan ? JB : Sidearm pitcher ( with the Kansas City Royals ) . Yeah , I 'm 0-for-24 against him . AS : Your most memorable baseball moment ? JB : Next to Darryl Kile 's no-hitter , it was probably the first time we got to the playoffs , in 1997 . We were n't that great of a team . We kind of won because the Cardinals did n't play that well that year . We finally got there , and a lot of the guys that I played with for a long time were there , and it was great . AS : What made Darryl Kile 's no-hitter No. 1 ? JB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so happy for one teammate . It was amazing . We knew about it from the sixth inning on , and when it actually happens , it 's incredible . AS : Where were you when you heard he had passed ? JB : I know a lot about that . That 's one of my closest friends . Moises Alou told me . It was just a tough day . AS : If you were n't playing baseball , how would you have made your living ? JB : I do n't know . I 'd either still be living with the two other guys that I lived with in college and we 'd have been working at a sporting goods store to this day ; or I was a marketing major , so who knows ? I could n't tell you what I would have done with that degree . I was a marketing major , but I was playing baseball . AS : How much longer do you want to play the game of baseball ? JB : I 've got two more years after this year on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That might be it . AS : What will you do when you have an actual summer vacation , something you 've never had as an adult ? JB : I 'd go down to Cabo and stay there . I would hang out . We have a home there , and I enjoy it there . Our house overlooks the water . It 's a great place to vacation . Great fishing . Great golf . Good nightlife . Great food . AS : Best golfing score ? JB : I shot 70 down at spring training at Grand Cypress two years ago . Three birdies , no bogeys . AS : Your worst habit ? JB : When you put something off , what is that ? Procrastination . That 's my worst . I do that . Somebody might leave me a message to call them , and I will wait days before I call them . Anything . AS : Your most embarrassing moment in baseball ? JB : I 've had a lot , especially when you strike out as many times as I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey Candaele because he used to put his shoelaces inside his laces . I used to say , ' What are you doing that for ? ' He goes , ' Well , in case I catch my laces on my spikes . ' I said , ' Yeah , whatever . ' I went out that night and went after a popup , and my lace caught on my spike and I fell on the ground . But I did catch the popup . And from that time on , I put my shoelaces inside my laces . AS : Ever wonder how huge your numbers would have been if you had Fenway Park your entire career ? JB : I do n't think about it like that because I was a different player at that time . I mean , who knows , I might not have gotten to the big leagues until ' 94 , ' 95 with the Red Sox , so I ca n't think that way . I played in the Astrodome and that was a big ballpark , but that was my home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? JB : I could hit for average . I was a right-hander that hit balls to right field . Well , in Fenway Park you want a right-hander to pull the ball and hit it off the wall . So I did n't really make much sense for the Red Sox at that time . AS : Ever think about how much Larry Andersen changed your life ? JB : I do . I 've got a picture of Larry and I together . We took it at a neighborhood bar when I went into Philadelphia , and we went and had a couple of beers . He 's funny . Whenever I 'm struggling , he calls me and tells me , ' Let 's pick it up , because people are starting to forget about me now . ' AS : Boston versus Houston ? JB : Totally different . Houston 's a lot more laid back . Boston 's a little bit fast paced . The people there love their sports teams . Put it this way : People in Texas are passionate about football . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , even down to the UConn girls basketball team . They 're very passionate , very knowledgeable and very tough . Houston has not got there yet because you 've got to remember , Houston 's only had a baseball team for about 40 years . They just have n't had the tradition that Boston has had . And the heartache . They say in Houston that they 've had heartache . It 's not quite like being a Red Sox fan . AS : Do you ever get back there ? JB : My mother still lives in Killingworth , Conn. , and I have family that lives in Boston . AS : Your biggest concern ? JB : That my two kids are going to grow up to be good kids , and to be healthy . You want to bring them up the right way . AS : Key to doing that ? JB : Communication , probably . Make sure you talk to them . Make sure you stay in their lives . Always make time for them . AS : If you were commissioner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , there 's a lot of things . We got steroids , we got traveling , we got the Montreal Expos . I mean , this is ridiculous that they have to go back down to Puerto Rico for 20 days . Make the decision for once and for all . And I 'd like to finish this Pete Rose thing , for once and for all . I 'd make him eligible for the Hall of Fame because he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame . Now as far as reinstating him in baseball , that 's a different story . But the Hall of Fame , he deserves to be in there . I do n't care what anybody says . I mean , 4,200 hits is 4,200 hits . All those people that are saying he has character flaws and all that , everybody needs to look at themselves in the mirror once in a while , too . Not everybody 's perfect . AS : Favorite baseball city to visit ? JB : Chicago . Great city . If it was n't for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you do on a day off in Chicago ? JB : That 's tough , because my family 's always there . If not , then Moises Alou is there and I 'm hanging out with him . Just eating and having a good time . AS : Your favorite restaurant to go to in another baseball city ? JB : I would probably go to this place that I just ate in last year in New York City called Il Mulino . It was unbelievable . My wife and I ate there last year , and it was phenomenal . It took about three hours , and by the time they brought out dinner , I was already stuffed . Food was great . AS : Best piece of advice a coach gave you ? JB : Because of my stance , the biggest thing people said is , ' Do n't fix anything that 's not broke . ' And my stance worked . I 've always wanted to change it . Tony Gwynn said the same thing to me . ' Do n't change it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use it . ' I was always wide , and then I tried in ' 94 to spread out and be like Tony Gwynn and just keep my head still , and somehow I ended up with my swing . I 'd say , ' Do n't fix anything that 's not broke . ' AS : The one piece of baseball memorabilia you have that you 're most proud of ? JB : My Carl Yastrzemski game-used jersey . I bought it from somebody because he was my idol growing up . I met him once back in ' 94 , and I was kind of shy at the time , and I did n't say much to him . Could n't . AS : Your most painful Red Sox loss ? JB : ' 86 , when they lost to the Mets in the World Series . That was unbelievable . I would say that 's the most painful loss I suffered  --  until I became a Houston Astro . Then I 've got a bunch of those .
