<p> FARMINGTON , Pa.  --  Stanley Jones , 49 , spent a weekend living a dieter 's dream . <p> He received one-on-one advice from a nutritionist , got a customized exercise program from a personal trainer and learned how to cook healthful fare from a gourmet chef . And he did it all during a stay in November at a luxury hotel at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort in southwestern Pennsylvania . <p> " This weekend has really invigorated me , " Jones said at the end of the two days . " When you are dieting alone , it 's hard . Sometimes you need someone to pump you up and give you a boost . " <p> A teacher from Centreville , Va. , Jones was chosen for the spa weekend because he lost 67 pounds last year on USA TODAY 's Weight-Loss Challenge , dropping to 295 pounds . The challenge is an annual series that profiles dieters and offers menus , recipes and fitness advice from professionals . <p> Like many dieters , however , Jones hit a plateau at 290 pounds that interrupted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him jump-start his weight loss so he can reach his goal of 185 pounds . <p> And it worked . Six weeks after his retreat , Jones weighs 280 pounds . <p> And he shares what he learned with USA TODAY readers . To give New Year 's resolutions an assist , the newspaper traditionally begins each year with stories on nutrition and exercise . <p> Jones has gone a significant distance , but he has n't finished the race . For years , he overate , sometimes consuming as much as 10,000 calories a day . <p> " I was out of control , " he says . " There is no need to sugarcoat it . " <p> He weighed 362 pounds in August 2004 and had diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol . His doctor told him he had to change the way he lived or he would die . <p> Jones ditched high-fat , high-sugar foods and limited himself to about 1,200 calories and 60 grams of carbohydrates a day . He ate three meals a day and no snacks . He drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segments daily , doing step aerobics , walking and weight training . He practiced his three-C philosophy : " Commitment , consistency and control . " <p> After a year , he had lost the 67 pounds and was down from eight medications a day to three : one for cholesterol and two for high blood pressure . He no longer takes any diabetes medication . <p> But in the fall , Jones started working two jobs and could n't find time to exercise . Four days a week he teaches astronomy at an alternative high school in the morning and works as an adult-education program specialist from 1 to 10 p.m . On the weekends , he takes college classes ( he has earned his doctorate ) and volunteers as a tutor . <p> It 's no wonder his scales were stuck . After dieting on his own for so long , Jones was ready for professional help . <p> Flavors from the chef <p> On his arrival at the spa , Jones is whisked off to the kitchen of the Aqueous restaurant in the Falling Rock hotel for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jones eats salmon several times a week but says he often cooks the fish until it 's dried out . <p> Racicot suggests baking 6 ounces of salmon at 150 degrees for 30 minutes on a bed of fresh thyme , rosemary and parsley . The slow-roast method keeps it moist . <p> " You can cut down the salt because you get flavor from the herbs , " Racicot says . " If you are only going to have 12 bites of salmon , each bite has to be as good as the first . <p> " And since you do n't want to use a lot of butter and cheese , you need to add different flavors to your foods in other ways . " <p> To do that , Racicot whips up a puree made with roasted beets , chicken broth and olive oil . He also makes a butternut squash soup with similar ingredients and tops it with crabmeat . " This is another way of eating your vegetables without chewing them . " <p> Racicot puts an artistic swirl of the beet puree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain yogurt and a handful of walnuts to add crunch and texture . <p> Jones gives the fish , soup and sauces rave reviews . " This is exactly what I need to know , " he says . " Sometimes I really miss the butter and sugar . I do need to find ways to add flavor . <p> " I do n't go the whole distance with preparing food , but I want to go part of the way . This is another way of eating beets . " <p> Beets are known to help with digestive problems , nutritionist Jim Barnes adds . <p> Jones pats his stomach and jokes , " Let me get this right : If I eat beets , it will fix my stomach . No Pilates . No exercise . I just eat beets . The South Beets Diet . " <p> At the end of the cooking lesson , Jones says to the chef : " The most important question for you , Dave , is this : What are you doing for the next six months ? If I had somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see how Oprah does it now . " <p> Trainer weighs in <p> Next , Jones heads to a private session with personal trainer Susan Claar . She shows him a variety of Pilates floor moves , including abdominal exercises , leg lifts and waist twists , explaining they will strengthen his abdomen and lower-back muscles to build a stronger midsection . <p> Pilates can improve posture , ease minor back discomfort and increase strength , Claar says . And the floor exercises can be done anywhere : " If you go on a road trip , you can do it in your hotel room . " <p> She recommends buying Stott Pilates DVDs to use at home . <p> Claar does a 20-minute step aerobics routine with Jones to show him ways to vary his routine at home , and then she demonstrates about a dozen strength-training exercises using free weights . " I recommend you have a personal trainer once a month to update your regimen , " she says . <p> At the end of almost two hours , Jones says , " we should have stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . " <p> " If I had Susan for my personal trainer , I probably would n't be able to get out of bed in the morning . She would work my tail off , but that 's what is needed . You can do exercises night and day , but if you do n't do them correctly , they do n't do you much good . " <p> Jones spends several hours with Barnes , the nutritionist , discussing the value of different foods and navigating a Sunday brunch buffet filled with high-fat and high-calorie landmines . <p> They pass up the pasta and potato salads , processed meats , bacon , French toast and desserts and load up two-thirds of their plates with vegetables and fruits and a third with salmon , shrimp , pecan-crusted trout and lean beef . <p> Choose variety <p> Barnes estimates the calories for the meal Jones has chosen at about 400 . " A small portion of several things is probably better for you than a big portion of one thing because you get a wider variety of nutrients , " Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably best to stay away from buffets when you 're trying to lose weight . The problem with buffets , Barnes says , is that people think they need to get their money 's worth , so they overeat . <p> Jones says his biggest obstacle is finding time to exercise . Barnes ' solution : Move the treadmill in front of the TV and walk while watching the news at night . <p> The two take a short walk , and Barnes asks Jones whether he has thought about running a marathon one day . <p> " As determined as you are , you could accomplish anything , and running a marathon is more mental than physical , " Barnes says . <p> He believes Jones will reach his goal because he 's strong-minded and is doing both parts of the weight-loss equation : diet and exercise . " It 'll be a cakewalk . " <p> Jones laughs . " Let 's not say cakewalk . It 's a salmon walk . "
