FORMER SAILBOAT OWNERS TELL US WHY THEY SWITCHED TO POWERBOATS AND HOW MUCH THEY ENJOY THEM . There 's no denying that a seemingly natural antipathy exists between sailboat and powerboat owners . For their part , powerboat owners are habitually dismissive of sailors as preppy , penurious or just plain nerds , referring to them as " blow-boaters " or " snailboaters . " Sailors fire back with " stinkpotters , " peevishly decrying the noise and exhaust spewed by powerboats , and bewailing the scandalous wakes they leave  --  in no-wake zones , no less . If this ersatz war were to be decided on the basis of boat sales , sailors would come in a distant second , and there 's nothing on the horizon to suggest that this order will change any time soon . The trend  --  for at least the last decade  --  has been from sail to power . Reasons range from the aging of the Boomer generation to the constraints on leisure time imposed by ever more time-consuming jobs . Then there 's the fact that powerboats offer more comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are winning over more former sailboat owners than ever before . There are far more ex-sailors among powerboat owners than vice versa . To find out the reasons they switched , we sought out some of these converts . Skip Barlow : True North 38 Who would have guessed that the Rear Commodore of the Cruising Club of America 's Florida Station is a powerboat owner ? Skip Barlow of Jupiter , Fla. , owns a Pearson True North 38 . " About 20 percent of our members own powerboats , " he says . " Everyone I know who has come down here Florida with a sailboat has taken the boat back up north and sold it . Then they buy a powerboat . " Here 's proof that dyed-in-the-wool sailors can kick the habit and appreciate the virtues of power . According to Barlow , the switch is often bred of necessity . " A sailboat requires much more physical activity to operate than a powerboat does . After a certain age you ca n't do it any more . " But Barlow 's conversion to power had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Florida is n't as sail-friendly as New England . " A sailor since the age of 10 , when he raced Dyer dinghies in Rhode Island , Barlow attended Brown University , where he continued to race . " I just could n't beat the guys from the Coast Guard Academy , where they had a coach , " Barlow recalls . He went on to practice law in Providence and race " other people 's boats , " participating in 18 Newport to Bermuda races , and winning in 1984 as watch captain . In those days Barlow would deliver his father 's 50-foot motorsailor to St. Thomas with his family and his friends as crew . " I raced it from Miami to Nassau , but it was no racing boat , " he says . Meanwhile , he was having his own boat built : a 47-foot Wellington ketch . He kept it in Ft . Lauderdale in the winter and South Dartmouth , Mass. , in the summer . He and his wife , Meg , and children , Bruce and Nancy , cruised the Bahamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog a lot , " he says . Having found a house in Jupiter for the winter , the Barlows sold the ketch soon after and decided it was time for an easier life on the water . " Boy , did we look at a lot of powerboats , " says Barlow . They settled on a 48 Defever . " In that boat we could cruise for a month  --  usually to the Bahamas  --  and never need to go ashore . " After his wife 's death in 1997 , Barlow decided to downsize . " I 'd had enough big-boat cruising . " He spotted a Pearson True North 33 at a boat show and made an offer . " That was a great boat , " says Barlow . " I took it to St. Petersburg on a CCA cruise his sailing experience put him in good stead with the Cruising Club and I took my grandchildren fishing a lot . " Last summer Barlow stopped in at Pearson in Warren , R.I. , and saw the latest True North  --  a 38 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite different from the 33 , " he says . " Of course there 's more room , especially in the engine room which houses a single Yanmar 480-hp diesel . But the big difference is in the sweetness of the ride . The hull has a better entry in rough water . I can cruise comfortably at 15 to 18 knots with no worries . " That bodes well for his plans to take his grandchildren to the Abacos this summer . One nice thing about the 38 is the variety of seating configurations that can be created in the large cockpit . " A powerboat is well-suited to Florida where you have to go some distance to find a cruising destination , " says Barlow . " It 's not like New England where there are gunk-holes everywhere . The Keys are best negotiated under power , and there are very few quiet coves and anchorages along the coast , although the west coast of the state has more than the east . " Few boat owners have the wealth of experience under sail that Skip Barlow has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nancy Schneider : Hunt 29 Nancy Schneider liked to race . At Drexel University she was on the sailing team . " I went to the Women 's Nationals instead of graduation , " she says . She and her husband , Bill , who raced his 13-foot Penguin on the Potomac , raced and cruised together on a variety of midsize boats . They bought a 36 Gulfstar in 1983 and , she says , " for the next seven years we 'd take off and go sailing for nine days a month . We 've been in every river , bay and cove on the Chesapeake . " When that became too tame , they bought a Bristol 53 and began ocean sailing from Maine to the Bahamas . " The boat saw a lot of wear and tear , " says Nancy . " Our broker told us we were harder on our gear in one year than his other clients were in ten years . We were dedicated sailors . We loved every minute of it . " Nancy would often enlist volunteers from the Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exumas when Bill , a dentist , was busy . In the summer they kept it in Maine . In 2000 the Schneiders began building a home on the Chesapeake . They parked the Bristol in Annapolis and borrowed their son 's 36-foot Fairline powerboat when they " needed a boat fix . " Again , they 'd go for nine days at a time  --  as far north as New England and as far south as Georgia . " The miracle of the powerboat , " says Nancy , " was that for the first time we did n't have to stay off shore . We discovered a whole new cruising area , the coastal islands of South Carolina and Georgia . We took our bicycles with us and explored Charleston , Savannah , Beaufort , Morehead City , even St. Augustine . " In 2003 they bought an Eastbay 49 . They also purchased property in Florida south of St. Augustine and spent time on Amelia Island . " We were looking for a boat that would replace the Bristol and the Fairline , but the Eastbay was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flybridge , which is pure heaven  --  up high , out in the elements , with a great view and a steering station , " says Nancy . But what she and Bill really wanted was a pilothouse boat . They finally found one they liked  --  a Marlow 57 Explorer . They eventually ordered one , although first they bought a Hunt 29 . Nancy calls it " our little dream boat . " The Hunt hangs on a lift at their house . " Bill gets off early and we go across the Bay for dinner , " says Nancy . " We also go on overnight trips on the weekend . " Nancy describes the 29 as " super agile . " She says , " It can go anywhere and do anything . We love it for the Bay , but we may take it to Jupiter . In the Hunt , we can get to spots that would be inaccessible to most sailboats , like Havre de Grace above the C and D Canal , a sleepy little town and one of our favorite destinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly true . " As for their Marlow , the Schneiders keep it in Florida , where they now have a home in Jupiter . " It 's a real ocean boat , like the Bristol , " says Nancy . " We 'll take it to the Canadian provinces and the Turks and Caicos . We can get there fast since it cruises at 20 knots . And we can operate it ourselves . There 's no need for crew . " The Schneiders , it seems , are converted . They plan to live their lives at sea on their motoryacht and use the Hunt as a day boat . Says Nancy , " It 's not a question of loving one lifestyle more than the other . We 've done both extensively and appreciate both . Our powerboats have given us complete flexibility in how we go , where we go and when we go . " Bill and Staci McLauchlan : Krogen 58 " When we 're cruising down the waterway and a sailboat passes , we invariably wave to the folks on board , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy day with frost on the deck and rain in the air , I ca n't help gloating a bit . In the warmth of the pilothouse , wearing a short-sleeved shirt and sipping coffee , I recall many such days bundled up at the helm of a sailboat . " Bill and his wife , Staci , have fond memories of their sailing days , but they 're steadfast about their switch to power  --  first to a Nordic Tugs 37 and then to a Krogen 58 . Like many sailors , Bill was introduced to the lifestyle via his parents . He grew up in Baltimore and his family had a small sailboat on Chesapeake Bay . After their marriage , Bill and Staci lived in Cincinnati , Ohio , where , in 1987 , they bought a Catalina 22 that they sailed on nearby lakes . Three years later they moved up to a Catalina 28 and sailed down the rivers from Cincinnati to Mobile , Ala. , and then on to Tampa , Fla . Because of the winding waterways and the many barges that plied them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast rather than to the actual experience . " During the three months it took , we motored about 90 percent of the time , " says Bill . So much for sailing on inland waters . The McLauchlans broadened their horizons and bought a bluewater boat , a Crealock 34 . " It was bulletproof , " says Bill . " I had notions of sailing to Tahiti and back . " Instead , he and Staci settled for the North Carolina coast . They had achieved range , but they craved comfort . " Although it could take you around the world , the Crealock was n't very beamy , and living aboard was like camping out , " Bill recalls . " It was small , dim and stuffy , had no AC and no separate shower . " The answer ? A powerboat . For the McLauchlans , trawler speed was plenty . " We were used to four to seven knots , " says Bill . So they chose a Nordic Tugs 37 and took delivery in the spring of 2001 Their home was in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plan was to take two- to three-month cruises up and down the coast . " But , " says Bill , " when nine-eleven occurred we thought , who knows what will happen ? So , we decided to cruise for six months . A long day for us was forty miles . We stayed strictly in the ICW and when we arrived at a place we liked we stayed for a few days and explored . We became liveaboards , but the Nordic was n't a true liveaboard boat . It was a big improvement over the Crealock , yet still lacked certain comforts . " Which brings us to the Krogen 58  --  a true home away from home . For the McLaughlans it 's home , period . When they saw it they looked at each other and said , in chorus , " I could live on this . " After cruising from the Keys to Canada in 2004 , they sold their house and moved aboard full time . " We knew it was the lifestyle for us , " explains Bill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boat , " as we used to , we now say , " " Let 's go home . " " " Outside on a sailboat you 're limited to the cockpit or the foredeck , where you 're tripping over sheets or furling lines , " says Bill . He and Staci have more living space in the Krogen than they would in many houses . They can sit or eat on the 58 's " back porch " or bridge . They drive from the heated/air-conditioned pilothouse . When the temperature 's right they open the doors and windows . With 1,700 gallons of fuel , the Krogen 's twin John Deeres can take them across the Atlantic ( 6 gph at 9 knots ) . They 've cruised the Bahamas and have plans to be in Nova Scotia this summer and in the Med  --  the boat will go by ship and they 'll fly  --  sometime in the future . Says Bill , " we have no regrets .
