Chapter 1 : Polly 's JourneyPolly Baymiller , Polly Baymiller , he does n't know what it means , but it both spurs him on and soothes him . Confuses him , too . He believes he is my adversary . Because he ca n't reach me directly , he 'll try to punish Tip instead . If my sallying to and fro is meant to tame Tip 's sorrows , then Tom means to compel them , means to draw the sorrows forth . If I intend to bring Tip happiness , Tom intends to thwart me . If I intend to bring Tip love , Tom means to confuse him . But the Night did n't care . It only picked me up , twirled me , and put me back down . Pretty casual on the uptake , are n't you ? I said , and huffed off to the ladies ' room to powder my nose , although I had no nose . Drummed my fingers on the side table and tried not to look worried , although I had no fingers . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home . My own threshold , my own door , the skittered leaves unswept from my dusty hallway . How disheveled I was , and miffed at my date , not even to have been driven home and given a kiss good-bye . The cad , I declared , though I set about doing just what the fickle Nig ht wanted of me . Cleaning the house . Wiping , dusting , mopping , and swabbing , the Night stern at my window whenever It came back to fetch me . Clean this , clean that . Is this your house , or mine , anyway ? I asked and , miffed , clutched the broom too fiercely , swished the dust cloth like skirts in an arrogant tango . On my private , ghostly dresser , Tip and Johnny turned to static , the tiny island became a blip on my radio , half the state of Wisconsin slid past my dial , all at once I ended up within whispering distance of some other dead wife and mother 's rightful husband , Lysle , and son , Gem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Drive slower , I found myself whispering contentiously to Lysle as if already accustomed to this new man 's fondness for belligerence , my words thumping inside his too rubbery ears , only to blend with the purring of the highway under the eighteen wheels of the semi . Never having sat next to such a wiry truck driver before , and never once having sat in the cab of a semi , I supposed I had to trust in the Night 's intuition and be not only concordant with wherever the Night plunked me , but sensible as well . All predicaments have purpose when one is a ghost , I figured , so I secured myself within the high , speeding perch of the surprising truck and waited to make sense of why on earth I 'd been put there . Had I been not a ghost but a mortal I might never again have set foot in a normal car , which from the cab looked like toys with no room for humans inside them . Squashable as bugs , and less important . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever that was , which Lysle could practically smell the steam rising off between him and his wife , where she 'd set the plate between them at ten o'clock of the last morning they spent together , the TV on since the morning before , and the morning before that , too . The shows did n't matter to Lysle as long as his wife fell asleep in the armchair next to his at bedtime , dressed in her day clothes , and woke up next morning , same chair , wearing her nightgown , a yellow brushed flannel as soft as her name . Violet . Skinny as a stem , too , no matter how many times she ate " one of them poppers , now I know why they call them that , " Lysle imagined her saying . His ears were pink as ham ; if she wanted to rib him about something , she gave them a twe ak , but that was as pissed off as she ever got . Pissed off . I never heard that term before Lysle used it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a window . Such a tranquil woman , Lysle 's wife , Violet . A heart softer than pussy , Lysle thought in my head , shocking me so much I could have died all over again if such a thing were possible , his words jumping around in my head as if he were the ghost , haunting me . I could feel him banging doors in the house the Night had made of me , the thunk of Lysle 's beer can when he set it on the table next to the poppers , the habit he had , while sitting , of lifting both legs at once and plunking his feet down square on the cat-smelling carpet , his boots never off unless he was taking a shower , but always untied . The TV on to a movie no one knew the name of , the mangy cockatiel pecking its calcium stick in the cage in the living room , the blinds open at night to a sandy view of pines , and open in the morning , too , the light glinting on Violet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Mary Kay representative , who was the next teller over at the bank Violet worked at , which blew up one day from a gas leak underneath it , the fuckers , the goddamn stupid shit-ass fuckers , I had to listen to Lysle thinking over and over , which is the closest probably anyone ever came to blushing when they were vapor , like me , thinner even than the steam that gathered on the windshield of the truck . But I forgave Lysle his language . His grief was more substantial than I was , and anyway he did n't know I was there . So , I was stuck with the wrong man knocking around inside me . A rude awakening , Lysle , for someone learning what it 's like to be a ghost . A real plate smasher , Lysle , all my cupboard doors swinging half cocked on their hinges . I thought if I did n't get back to the tiny island that second and let Tip step over my threshold and let me hold him , I 'd ... I 'd what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gem , who was dwarfed by the passenger seat , his untrimmed bangs like rows of crooked W 's . Do n't forget to wash that peanut butter out of your eyebrows when your daddy pulls in at the next truck stop , I whispered to Gem , after which I heard all his ideas , too , as if I were the hallway and they were the footsteps , only Gem 's footsteps were harder to follow than his father 's because Gem did n't quite know how to talk yet even though he was five years old . Gem 's eyes were so dark brown the black dot in the middle was like a tunnel with no end . But he remembered every runnel of chocolate sauce in every ice cream sundae his mother had ever made him , and every spoon she made him lick so clean he could see his pursed lips in it , and every time she urged him not to squeeze the new guinea pigs too hard . The guinea pigs were left at home in a cardboard box with their mother , lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she 'd last stepped out of them , under the dining room table with the bowl of drippy peaches on it . After three days of driving , the inside of Gem 's elbow smelled to him like a puppy . No it does n't . Yes it does . No it does n't . Yes it does . Gem shook his head no and nodded yes . He was such a tiny thing , Gem , half swallowed up by the passenger seat of the semi with nothing to sit on but his own cowboy boots to see out the windshield . He was up on his knees even with the seat cranked high as it would go , craning his neck at all the motorcycles his father pointed out to him . Gem knew motorcycles like other children his age knew the letters of the alphabet . His father caromed right past the next couple of truck stops . Gem wet his pants . A whole day went by before his father thought to give him clean clothes . With a dry paper towel he rubbed the peanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . Violet would have taken a damp dish towel to him , a gentle spiral starting at the tip of his nose and ending round and round the creases of his neck . Gem felt like the genie 's bottle when his mother washed his face , like the genie might pop out of him and give her a Harley , but still the only place she ever wanted to go was home with Gem . Now she must have changed her mind . No she did n't . Yes she did . Gem clapped his hands over his ears in a rhythmic way so the sound of his father 's truck was like the custom-made gurrr of his mother 's new Harley starting up and shutting off again every time she remembered she had n't said good-bye . Gem had never ridden in his dad 's truck before , had only sat in it nights when it was parked near their house with the engine running so the poppers would n't spoil . Twice-baked potatoes were better than poppers if you were as hungry as Gem was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot dog . Get him some milk , I whispered to Lysle , then gave a hasty swirl of the dust rag across the dial of my radio , trying to get back to Tip . But I just skimmed past him , heard just the timbre of Tip 's laughter before sliding helplessly into range of Lysle again . " Go get you one of them straws , " Lysle said to Gem so Gem could blow milk bubbles when Lysle left him in the truck outside the tavern Lysle always stopped at en route to St. Louis . It would n't do to bring a five-year-old into the bar , especially when he had to tell all the truckers about what happened to Violet . Yes it fucking would , you do n't protect a five-year-old from his own mother getting blown to pieces when she was counting other people 's money , her and twenty thousand dollars turned to fairy dust in the same second . You ca n't protect a kid from something like that , Lysle debated back and forth between my ears . Yes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to buy you a shot . How much money did Violet take out of the bank when she rode off on her Harley ? Enough to buy heaven , I whispered to Lysle even though there was no such place , exactly . Heaven for me was for one split second seeing Jack at his desk in one of the restaurants writing a check to one of the charities ( just because Jack was possessive did n't mean he was n't generous , too ) , and when I lost sight of Jack and could n't find Tip no matter how fiercely the Night bid me dust , I felt heavenly enough watching Gem eat his supper and drift off to sleep like a good boy . I had to be happy , simply because the idea of being a sad ghost instead of a glad one was too redundant . Dead is dead , but glad 's more resourceful . Not even glad ghosts know how to be ghosts right away , however . We take hold of whatever catches us , and reach for what does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like feeling Lysle twist inside me like a wet towel when another trucker in the bar joked how his girlfriends got too ma ny headaches . The other men shushed the man , but Lysle was already gasping with indignation , his ears pinker than ever , his anger slapping my insides like a wet towel swatting the walls . " At least your girlfriend had her head still attached to her body . At least you get the whole lady . Me , I do n't even get my wife in my own wife 's coffin . I get confetti . I 'll give you an ache to think about , you do n't get down on your knees this minute and thank God your lady 's alive . Get down ! Get down ! " Lysle 's bootlaces snapping like whips every time he brought his foot down . The trucker raised himself off his bar stool . I 'd never been hit by anyone . No one ever even slapped me . Certainly Jack would sooner die himself than even pinch my arm to bring me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicks around the wrung-out pleats of the dress Jack buried me in . Appliqud daisies . Not my favorite dress at all even back when we women pretended to like such clothing , but I did n't bat an eye when they prodded and poked me into it , although who would have imagined going sleeveless into eternity ? Heaven was Gem 's breath ruffling the daisy petals , dreaming about the front door of his house in Wisconsin with the light that blinked on by itself when anyone got close to it . Hell was Lysle spitting shots down my throat after the other truckers held him and the offender apart . Whiskey did n't faze me and though I 'd never liked the odor except on New Year 's , I 'd give anything to be able to smell it now . That and sweat puppies . Sweat puppies was Lysle 's way of talking about the smell in the creases of Gem 's elbows . Glug glug . When Lysle drank I felt like the bottle with the whiskey going in backward . I 'd never thought how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social drinker , yes , but so was I a little . Still , Lysle wore whiskey quite naturally . He just missed being dapper , with a shot in his hand . His muscles were all skin and bone , Lysle 's . He was built like a ranch hand , all wire and denim . There was something raw about him when he was n't drinking . Then , cooked . Gem , take the keys out of the ignition , I whispered maternally , when his father was still in the tavern . I was frightened of the notion of a drunken Lysle behind the wheel . Being a ghost , I could n't hear my own voice , but I could feel a breeze in Gem 's ears . Gem kept sleeping . Gem , get hold of those keys and pull them out of the ignition , I whispered again . Gem 's sleep was like water tunneling through pipes . His dream of the front door light blinking on by itself was like an attic I did n't know I had in me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live past age five and a half . In the bar , Lysle was getting ready to leave , the roar of the truck already a promise to him . He was putting on his jacket even though he had n't taken it off . How a man can get his ears snagged in a zipper is a puzzle only alcohol can solve . He was determined to drive very fast with his eyes shut so when he woke in the morning he 'd be where he was going even though he did n't quite remember where he meant to get to anymore . Gem , you can drive your dad 's truck , Gem , I whispered to Gem 's tousled hair , the top of his head squared off willy-nilly like his pet guinea pigs thirsting for water back home in their box of wood shavings . Gem 's nose whistled in sleep . There were dots on his face , I could n't tell if they were freckles or dirt . If I were Violet I 'd leave them there , even if they were dirt . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his black T-shirt and black jeans and his cowboy boots . Gem , just think , you could be the first five-year-old ever to drive a semi full of jalapeo poppers , I whispered . I did n't know what poppers were . I 'd never heard of anything like that when I was alive . Wake up , Gem . I pleaded . Take out the keys . Gem stirred and woke up . He was n't wearing his seat belt . The door of the tavern banged open . Out stumbled Lysle all wired to get on the road . That was Lysle 's word , too . I did n't know wired . I wondered if Jack did , or if he knew jalapeos . Sounded like a dance step . Lysle lurched toward the truck . Gem climbed on his knees so he 'd be able to see out the windshield . His tousled head just an inch or two clear of the glass . For a moment , just a moment , I was angry with Violet for leaving me to look after her child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Violet , I said to myself , like Poor me , knowing how much I wanted to be with Tip . Like me , Violet was drifting , spun by the Night , then jilted , left standing on a doorstep or crossing a threshold into the outskirts of some other dead woman 's family with the object of easing their troubles , polishing their edges , unsnarling , if not their hungers , at least their hair . Being dead , I thought , is not unlike being in a kitchen with the door shut , the new dishwasher humming so nobody knows what you 're doing in there , what you 're thinking or feeling , what they 're getting to eat . I used to stomp my foot in my kitchen , bang pots and pans , throw a wet sponge if I was angry at Jack , mix a batch of biscuits maybe , pour grape juice into Popsicle molds , burn my knuckles in the freezer finding a steak for tomorrow , lay it thunk on a plate , unwrap the crisp heavy white paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenderness , frustration , and mischief that happens in a kitchen happens in private , then vanishes the second they stab it with their forks . I used to think the only men familiar with the waxy crispness of butcher paper are the butchers , the only men who know the gritty pop of a can opener are the die-hard midnight snackers intent on a tuna fish sandwich . And Jack a restaurateur these days ! In my kitchen , before I died , before he found entire restaurants reflected in the curve of every salvaged spoon and platter , Jack did n't even know where to find the bread and butter . I remember the time he asked , " Where do we keep the toast ? " and how he used to read the newspaper af ter dinner in his armchair next to mine , but my chair would be empty , I 'd be printing the twins ' names on lunch bags , next day they 'd never notice when I 'd spelled all their names incorrectly on purpose , even packed Jack a bag marked Lilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with embarrassment to discover he was eating some dainty lady 's sandwich . Lysle stopped short in the middle of the parking lot , appearing troubled . After a moment he did something I 'd never seen a man do in a public place . Jack would hang himself before he peed in a parking lot in the presence of a lady even if he did n't know she was there . I never even saw Jack pee in the bathroom . My own husband . And he never saw me either , though sometimes we chatted through the cracked-open door . Lysle 's pee splashed against the dark of the pavement . He was n't thinking about doing it , just doing it , so I did n't feel it on the floors of my house . I was a house , he was peeing , everything happening naturally . Gem caught sight of the truck keys hanging from the dash . He touched them , they swung , Lysle zipped up still looking troubled , I could feel his confusion like a jug of milk turning sour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . His hand was so tiny the key stayed as it was . The curve of the windshield was big enough to represent everything he 'd need to pass through to get from life to death . And Lysle drunk as a skunk , ready to stink up Gem 's chance at a good , long life . Put your weight on the key , I whispered into Gem 's guinea pig hair . You can do it , I whispered across the span of his chest , a chest so narrow I could have kissed both nipples at once , though of course I 'd never dreamed of touching a child 's nipples . Not a body part I was ever terribly aware of . Bottles had nipples . That 's all . Rinse the nipples , brush the nipples , boil the nipples , buy new nipples , that 's all . Kiss the nipples , I whispered to Gem by mistake . Gem gazed down at his narrow wedge of T-shirt , where the picture of a cowgirl lassoed a motorcycle with a coiled purple snake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was alive , buying T-shirts for my boys . I bought white ones , so I could have the pleasure of keeping them white . Spotless . Ironed . There was a whole stack of hand-me-down snap-sided T-shirts waiting for Tip to be born , white as they 'd been in our first layette . There is something I regret , something I could have done that I did n't , after the priest told me to give birth and die . Knowing I 'd never have the chance to dress Tip , still , I could have played with those shirts like a girl with a doll , snapped them , smoothed the white cotton under my fingers , even spilled a little milk on them , washed them , ironed them all over again , folded them just for the pleasure , as if Tip were born already and I was doing it for him . I had a feeling from the start he would n't be twins like the others , he 'd have twice as many T-shirts as the rest of them but no partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands while climbing the steps , the way they learned their pairs of names as if both names belonged to each of them , so David was David and Dennis , and Dennis was David and Dennis , too  --  but I did n't say as much to Jack , how Tip would be alone with his pile of too many shirts . Back and forth the keys swung . Gem gave the key a good , hard twist . Already he 'd pressed the buttons , pulled the knobs . The wipers swished , the radio blared , the turn signal blinked . Gem 's baby teeth showed crooked when the engine roared . Lysle lunged for the truck , nearly fell on his face , threw himself over Gem , yanked the keys from the dash , and with a drunken yell threw them as far as he could , past the noses of the other parked trucks . Just as I 'd planned . Bingo , Lysle , I whispered . They made no noise when they landed , the keys . They might not ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 'd ya do that for ? What 'd ya do that for ? Lysle screaming at Gem , the words ricocheting like pool balls inside me . But Gem was unfazed . He was accustomed to his father 's flailing , his father 's hullabaloos . He decided the keys had n't fallen . Had n't landed . Were still skimming and careening . " Bingo , " he said . After he slept off his drink , Lysle spent forty minutes kicking the grass in search of the keys , then gave up and dug through the glove compartment for the trucking firm 's phone number to call in for new ones . By then the morning heat had turned to foil on the top of the trailer bisecting the small dirt lot , the truck 's nose in one patch of shade and the rear fender in another , but everything in between square in the sun . Under the trailer , where Gem crawled looking for fishing lures and parts of old pocketknives , there gathered a slippery smell like the inside of an empty popper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last poppers to spread in rows on the cookie sheet for his parents . His mother was dead . The tavern was closed on Mondays . The pay phone was outside the door , but his father kept losing his quarter . Three facts , like three drawers Gem opened and closed inside me to see if the contents snuck from drawer to drawer when he was n't looking . Every so often the pay phone rang two and a half times for no reason , after which the trilling of the insects in the grass became more pronounced . Finally his father 's quarter clinked the right way , but no one answered the phone at the trucking company , so finally Lysle phoned his sister , Carol , in the pinewoods outside of Iola , Wisconsin , and asked if there was anyone who felt like driving the four hundred and fifty miles south to come get him . It was n't just being stuck that made Lysle so homesick all of a sudden . It was what he 'd found out . He never should 've hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep down , he must have hoped to come upon her hitching a ride on the highway , but now that he understood that this would n't be so , he lo nged at least to have a cry on the shoulder of Iola , where he had grown up , not far from the pinewoods he 'd kept home in with Violet , their beach chairs sunk in a bed of pine needles around a giant fire pit for parties in the clearing outside their built-on trailor . Iola sat in the skirts of the kettle moraines on the edge of dairy country . Dawn smelled of milk , noon of clover . " Sid 'll do it , " Carol answered Lysle right away . " He 's on his way back from wherever . " Lysle guffawed , relieved to have something to snort at in the midst of his yearning for a double-decker cone from the ice cream gazebo near the water reservoir in Iola . No one had seen Sid in years . Wherever was jail , most likely . In any case Sid Haarstad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years in the navy before kayaking ninety miles of the Mekong River , only to be arrested upon return in Honolulu for packing a hilt full of opium , was the last person in the world , twice married and twice divorced notwithstanding , who upon acquittal and release from jail would choose to spend a summer watching home movies of spilled ice cream cones melting on the sidewalks of Mainstreet , U.S.A. , even if he was desperate to recoup . But now he was on his way east to Wisconsin . Sid must be feeling unstrung , Carol confided to Lysle . Unstrung . The funny word plunked inside me , but everything else about Sid was as legible to me as print on paper , a book on my shelf that I would n't have so much as flipped through if I were alive . Dead , I was required to play a role in it , somehow , it being not Lysle 's but Sid 's story between the lines of which the Night had so trickily slipped me . And so there I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the Night was preparing to put me . In all the phone calls Sid had ever made from jail , he claimed not to know how the opium had ended up in the hilt of the sword . He 'd traded his kayak for the sword at the close of the Mekong River trip . It was a World War I sword , but the farmer who traded it used the weapon to gut pumpkins . For supper on the day Sid climbed the terraced slope to the village for a case of the bitter , beerish liquor they made in those parts , the farmer placed a wobbly pumpkin between Sid 's feet , pulled the sword from the sheath , and lifted the blade over both their heads as reverently as if waiting for God to say which of the three round objects  --  Sid 's head , the farmer 's head , or the pumpkin  --  should prepare to meet its demise . For a long moment the sword stayed horizontal with the sky , and the look of concentration on the farmer 's face intensified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , but when the blade arced onto the pumpkin it made only a wet thwacking sound that did nothing but dent the rind . The farmer burst out laughing at his favorite joke , then grew more and more hilarious as he hacked at the pumpkin like he did every evening , thumping and sawing , the blade of the sword dull as mud , the orange pulp flying . Finally the farmer 's bent-shouldered wife scooped out the meat and stewed it with chilies and basil while Sid wondered in English whether the sword had ever killed anyone in a war . The farmer raised his eyebrows , then poured more beer into Sid 's mug from a standing height the way the waiters poured tea in the fancy Asian restaurants , the arc of liquid spanning the table without a splash . At sundown Sid was due back at the river with a case of the sour beer . He offered the farmer first some money and then his wristwatch in exchange for the heavy curved sword , then sign-talked the man into accompanying him to where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sword resembled the curve of the kayak , making the trade seem inevitable to Sid , who lived his whole life anyway trading one event for another in an unending chain of adventure of which the opium stuffed in rolled bags in the hilt of the sword was the link that finally did n't seem to lead anywhere but back to Iola . That was where the Book of Sid ended , so far , the brittle pages edged with gold because that 's what Sid 's heart was made of even if nobody knew it but me . Many years had gone by since his family had laid eyes on him , except for a formal navy portrait of someone who looked like a Gettysburg militiaman time-warped to the wrong war . At family gatherings the photo was passed hand to hand , the droopy handlebar mustache commented upon and examined until some consensus was reached as to whether the portrait was really of Sid , and if so , then for what act of heroism was there a Purple Heart pinned above the National Defense ribbon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his head he lost , " one of the family always remarked , meaning Sid had lost his head long before going to Vietnam . But aside from the women , Sid was the smartest of the family . Carol said to Lysle , " Tell me the number of where you are and how to get there , and Sid 'll swing by and pick you and Gem up . You know Sid . He 'll do anything once . " " Forget it , " said Lysle , reading Carol the phone number anyway . " Like I 'm gon na wait three weeks for some disappearing brother who ai n't showing up before he goes somewhere else on the way . Gem ! " Lysle shouted , pressing the receiver against the crook of his shoulder , " You ai n't found them keys , you should n't be sitting there playing with that fishing lure ! " Gem wrapped the parts of the pocketknife in a dandelion leaf , then crawled back under the truck in search of shade . He could n't search for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were safe in heaven in his mother 's blue jean pocket or swinging in the sparkly wind , a thousand colors trapped in the strands of Gem 's mother 's long dishwater hair . Every time Violet used to say her hair was dishwater , Gem imagined soapy lather in a jelly jar cup . Instead of searching for the keys as his father had told him , Gem searched for the grasshopper he 'd noticed earlier perched secretively in one of the tire treads . When he spotted it flexing its legs on the slope of a matchbook and had caught the pale insect in his cupped hand , careful not to crush the helmet or twist the strawlike feet backward , he shimmied on his belly through the dirt into sunlight , leaving the matchbook behind so he could look for it later . Lysle hung up the phone , wondering if it might be acceptable for a stranded man with a hungry son to break the tavern window in hopes of honey-roasted peanuts , soft drinks , jerky , and beer . No more beer , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lysle hunted for the best way to kick open the tavern . The front door was too thick , the windows nearly too narrow but not quite too high . He found a rock propping up a loose drainpipe , took off his T-shirt , then on second thought put it on again and ushered Gem over . " Take your shirt off quick , it 's dirtier than mine , " he said . " What for ? " asked Gem . " To get in the window , " said Lysle . Gem wondered how a T-shirt could climb in a window . Anyway , if he tried to take off his , the grasshopper would escape . But then he would find out how a T-shirt could climb in a window . He took off his shirt . The grasshopper plummeted upside down to the ground , where it wiggled its feet like someone pumping a bicycle . The telephone rang two and a half times and stopped . Lysle wrapped his hand inside the T-shirt and picked up the rock with it before climbing on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and shut his eyes , I whispered fierce as I could , for it dawned on me finally that I could be heard , my words a skitter of dust but their message conveyed . " Move away and shut your eyes , " obeyed Lysle , whose eyes glazed a moment with the start of a sneeze . Gem stepped back a distance and shielded his eyes , peeking between his fingers . Smack smack smack . Every time the wrapped-up rock broke glass , Gem 's toes curled in his boots . Head or feet first ? Lysle pondered back and forth inside me , making me think of dancing on the moonlit pontoon knotted to the end of the dock . Even nights I was pregnant with Tip , Jack and I danced on that boat , knowing we probably would n't have another summer to dance through . Now I was glad Jack did n't know what I know  --  that my death would be a dance in the arms of the Night , who stepped in to steal me and Jack from each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled of lake flies and citronella while the lily pad blossoms gave no fragrance at all . The music was tinny where it drifted off the dock , like a hotel band under distant palm trees away from which we 'd snuck to a private cove . I wanted a thatched umbrella , those nights , and a torch with an open flame , and someone crossing the house with towels folded over their forearm , heading for our bedroom to turn back the sheet and lay wrapped mints on starched pillowcases . Wrought iron , plaster of Paris , brass polish , varnish , steel wool , and sawdust . Those were Jack 's smells , that summer I was pregnant with Tip , but I could n't smell them now if we were stepping on each other 's toes . Nor cigarettes . Smoking , Jack held the cigarette backward so the lit end hid in the curve of his palm . His wrist swiveled when he inhaled . Side to side on the dock , dancing with Jack , pregnant for the last time , I kissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kissed the crease of the collar and rubbed the tip of my nose around the shaved spot below his ear . I had a theory I told only Gwen , when we were starting to be friends , when she was pregnant with Johnny , when the neighborhood was new . Jack was tight with the developer and made sure every house had a view of the lake , or if not , a piece of the channel . He still called them his houses years after other families had been paying them off . Gwen and I liked to spy on him surveying the lawn , evenings when John , Gwen 's husband , was still at work at the hospital , rallying for peace . " Married to an anesthesiologist . " That 's why she fought herself instead of him , it was less frustrating . Gwen used to sigh . What good was peace without struggle , negotiation , truce , capitulation , or surrender ? What good was peace when you could pop it along with a tranquilizer ? Had I lived a little longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought she might coax John to seek some help for his drug use  --  I saw him at the hospital once , when I stopped there on some errand , he was gliding around on those black Chinese slippers  --  but instead I only told her I knew how it went , and that Jack 's and my battles were all tongue-in-cheek , no pun intended , I said . And that I had a theory . I told her love is n't a state of mind , the way a lot of people think it is . It 's a method of behaving , there 's nothing abstract about it , it 's like electrons in a wire , you need to flip a switch for the light to come on ; love is cause and effect , first the act , then the feeling , first the kiss , then the forgiveness , first you iron the damn trousers and then you love the way he looks in them , and so on . Gwen said , So that 's why they call it making love . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to adore Tip the way I wanted him to . Side to side on the wood slats , I knew this and hated Jack for it , and nuzzled his pocket and hated him , and watched the moon slip between some clouds and hated him , and leaned my head into the crook of his arm and hated , yet forgave , and hated , yet forgave . Lysle shook the glass from Gem 's T-shirt before giving it back . The larger shards of window lay heavy in the brittle grass and did n't shatter when Gem stomped them with his heels . " Gem , " said Lysle . Gem quit stomping , flapped the shirt even harder than Lysle had flapped it to try to shake off the parking lot dirt and reveal again the picture of the cowgirl lassoing the motorcycle , and said to his father , " Not me . " " You do n't even know what I asked you yet , " said Lysle . " So what . I ai n't doin ' it . " Gem 's smudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Brown marbles swimming under willful flecks of clouds . Not ai n't , I amended . Not . I 'm not doing it . He ai n't doing it , Lysle thought with a shake of his head , wanting a beer more than anything . He stepped back up onto the three stacked bricks and gripped his hands around the smoothest-looking part of the windowsill and jumped and pulled , but the window was narrower than it appeared or else his belt loop was stuck on a nail . " God fucking piss on a fucking stick ! " He struggled . " Fucking horseshit goddamn piss on a fucking haystack . " Lysle yanked and shoved , it did n't matter which way , the window was too narrow and his belt loop was snagged on a nail , too . Both . At once . And the sunken floor inside was lower than the ground outside the wall . He was stuck like water in ice . Just as I 'd intended . " Pull my ankles ! " he yelled . Gem could n't reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but unlace his father 's boots by mistake . The telephone rang three and a half rings . " Shut the dickface up ! " Lysle yelled , knowing how all the truckers would make fun of him tomorrow night before they unstuck him . He knew they 'd feed Gem a hamburger but feed Lysle salted peanuts by tossing them from a distance into his mouth while keeping score on the blackboard . Home versus visitors . Whichever team won would get to give him a shave . He 'd need a shave by then , all right . He 'd need a cry , too , stuck in a window with no Violet giggling gently at the sight of his jammed backside the way she used to titter if he left his fly unzipped . His nose itched no matter which way he rubbed . As for me , I was laughing so hard all my memories shook inside me , which made me cry instead . Now that I knew I could make myself heard , I was all the more impatient to try it on Tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flitting by , and I could n't catch them from where I was , stuck in Lysle 's life and Lysle in the window . How I wanted to get near Tip , he 'd sneeze , or almost . I could n't wait to see him tilt back his head and wince . Alive , I used to play a game with David and Douggie , Dennis and Drew  --  stop their sneezes midsniff just by placing my pinkie finger against their nostrils and saying gesundheit before it was time . " I want a drink , " Gem announced from the far side of the wall , interrupting my reverie  --  the sight of Drew 's nose twitching like a mouse 's , but Douggie 's as disdainful as a cat 's . Lysle 's voice was muffled when it came through the window . " You do n't want it half as much as I will soon enough , " he said . The phone rang again with a kind of a flutter , more like a bird than a phone . " Catch it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who dare ? " he blurted into the receiver . " I do , " said the gruff-voiced man at the other end . " Who dis ? " " Me , " said Gem . " Me who ? " said the man . " Me Gem ? " There was a nodding silence . " Well , Gem , so happens I 'm just a hundred miles down the road , " said the man . " Want to get rescued by your uncle Sid ? " " Who dat ? " said Gem . Tell him to hurry , I whispered , for though I did n't know yet why I needed Sid , I knew he could help me , steal me out of the fickle whirl of the Night , settle my nerves , and tell me not to despair , though there was so much Tip was doing that I could n't see or stop , wiping my eyes although I had no eyes , preparing me for what as yet unknotted grief my tears could possibly be made of .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
