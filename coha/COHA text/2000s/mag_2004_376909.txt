Perhaps Hollywood ca n't be trusted to make Hollywood-style movies anymore . When ancient-history films lumber like the elephantine Alexander , or when technological gewgaws abduct the magic of fantasy in films like The Polar Express , where can a curious cinephile go ? China . That 's where director Zhang Yimou blended history book with graphic novel in the worldwide hit Hero , and whence he returns with the even zippier , more cunning kung fu caper , House of Flying Daggers . <P> In the late years of the Tang dynasty , an insurgency has arisen , led by the mysterious Flying Daggers group . Government officers Leo ( Andy Lau , of Infernal Affairs ) and Jin ( Takeshi Kaneshiro ) are assigned to stamp out the conspiracy . Their first stop is a bordello , where the madam tells Leo she has a lovely blind girl , Mei ( Zhang Ziyi ) , to dance for him  --  a dance of love , deception and death . <P> This movie has enough wirework and furious swordplay to raise an audience 's collective gasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisbees , careering toward their targets with the help of some supple computer trickery . The narrative is no less devious : every loyalty , emotional and political , must be questioned , tested , fought for . <P> The cast list is like a convocation of the Three Chinas : Taiwan 's Kaneshiro , Hong Kong 's Lau and the mainland 's Zhang Ziyi . All are terrific , but the lady shines brightest . Fierce in a battle with eight soldiers , coquettish as she bathes before the enrapt Jin , Zhang is charisma incarnate . She is already nearing American stardom , playing the lead in Memoirs of a Geisha . You can bet she will reveal a new kind of star quality , even as the dazzling Daggers shows Hollywood how to make an action film with depth and pizazz.  --  By Richard Corliss
