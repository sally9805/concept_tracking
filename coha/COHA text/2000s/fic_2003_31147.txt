Chapter 1 : Global Pork Rind In late March Bob Dollar , a young , curly-headed man of twenty-five with the broad face of a cat , pale innocent eyes fringed with sooty lashes , drove east along Texas State Highway 15 in the panhandle , down from Denver the day before , over the Raton Pass and through the dead volcano country of northeast New Mexico to the Oklahoma pistol barrel , then a wrong turn north and wasted hours before he regained the way . It was a roaring spring morning with green in the sky , the air spiced with sand sagebrush and aromatic sumac . NPR faded from the radio in a string of announcements of corporate supporters , replaced by a Christian station that alternated pabulum preaching and punchy music . He switched to shit-kicker airwaves and listened to songs about staying home , going home , being home and the errors of leaving home . The road ran along a railroad track . He thought the bend of the rails unutterably sad , those cold and gleaming strips of metal turning away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left on Uncle Tam 's doorstep listening for the inside clatter of coffee pot and cups although there had been no train nor tracks there . He did not know how the rails had gotten into his head as symbols of sadness . Gradually the ancient thrill of moving against the horizon into the great yellow distance heated him , for even fenced and cut with roads the overwhelming presence of grassland persisted , though nothing of the original prairie remained . It was all flat expanse and wide sky . Two coyotes looking for afterbirths trotted through a pasture to the east , moving through fluid grass , the sunbacklighting their fur in such a way that they appeared to have silver linings . Irrigated circles of winter wheat , dotted with stocker calves , grew on land as level as a runway . In other fields tractors lashed tails of dust . He noticed the habit of slower drivers to pull into the breakdown lane  --  here called the " courtesy lane "  --  and wave him on . Ahead cities loomed , but as he came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water towers and storage bins . The elevators were the tallest buildings on the plains , symmetrical , their thrusting shapes seeming to entrap kinetic energy . After a while Bob noticed their vertical rhythm , for they rose up regularly every five or ten miles in trackside towns . Most were concrete cylinders , some brick or tile , but at many sidings the old wood elevators , peeling and shabby , still stood , some surfaced with asbestos shingles , a few with rusted metal loosened by the wind . Rectilinear streets joined at ninety-degree angles . Every town had a motto : " The Town Where No One Wears a Frown " ; " The Richest Land and the Finest People " ; " 10,000 Friendly People and One or Two Old Grumps . " He passed the Kar-Vu Drive-In , a midtown plywood Jesus , dead cows by the side of the road , legs stiff as two-by-fours , waiting for the renderer 's truck . There were nodding pump jacks and pivot irrigation rigs ( one still decked out in Christmas lights ) to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipes and gauges , though such was the size of the landscape and their random placement that they seemed metal trinkets strewn by a vast and careless hand . Orange-and-yellow signs marked the existence of underground pipelines , for beneath the fields and pastures lay an invisible world of pipes , cables , boreholes , pumps and extraction devices , forming , with the surface fences and roads , a monstrous three-dimensional grid . This grid extended into the sky through contrails and invisible satellite transmissions . At the edge of fields he noticed brightly painted V-8 diesel engines ( most converted to natural gas ) , pumping up water from the Ogallala aquifer below . And he passed scores of anonymous , low , grey buildings with enormous fans at their ends set back from the road and surrounded by chain-link fence . From the air these guarded hog farms resembled strange grand pianos with six or ten white keys , the trapezoid shape of the body the effluent lagoon in the rear . Still , all of these machines and wire and metal buildings seemed ephemeral . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enormous North American grassland extending from Canada to Mexico , showing its thousand faces to successions of travelers who described it in contradictory ways : under gritty spring wind the grass blew sidewise , figured with bluets and anemones , pussytoes and Johnny-jump-ups , alive with birds and antelope ; in midsummer , away from the overgrazed trail margins , they traveled through groin-high grass rolling in waves ; those on the trail in late summer saw dry , useless desert studded with horse-crippling cactus . Few , except working cowboys , ventured onto the plains in winter when stinging northers swept snow across it . Where once the howling of wolves was heard , now sounded the howl of tires . Bob Dollar had no idea he was driving into a region of immeasurable natural complexity that some believed abused beyond saving . He saw only what others had seen  --  the bigness , pump jacks nodding pterodactyl heads , road alligators cast off from the big semi tires . Every few miles a red-tailed hawk marked its hunting boundary . The edges of the road were misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said to the rearview mirror , " some flat-ass place . " Though it seemed he was not so much in a place as confronting the raw material of human use . A white van turned out of a side road in front of him and he narrowed his eyes ; he knew white vans were favored by the criminally insane and escaped convicts , that the bad drivers of the world gravitated to them . The van sped away , exceeding the speed limit , and faded out of sight . There appeared , far ahead , on the other side of the road , a wambling black dot that resolved into a bicyclist . A trick of the heated air magnified the bicycle , which appeared thirty feet high and shivered as though constructed of aspic . He passed another hawk on a telephone pole . The great prairie dog cities of the short-grass plains which once covered hundreds of square miles were gone , but some old-fashioned red-tails continued to hunt as their ancestors , in flat-shouldered soar , turning methodically in the air above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many more had taken up modern ways and sat atop convenient poles and posts waiting for vehicles to clip rabbits and prairie dogs . They retrieved the carrion with the insolent matter-of-factness of a housewife carelessly slinging a package of chops into her shopping cart . Such a hawk , a bit of fur stuck to the side of its beak , watched the bicyclist pumping along west . As the machine moved slowly through the focus of those amber eyes the bird lost interest ; the bicycle had no future in the hawk world ; more rewarding were trucks on the paved highways , grilles spattered with blood , weaving pickups that aimed for jacks and snakes as though directed by the superior will on a telephone pole . The bicyclist , reduced to human size , and Bob Dollar , in his sedan , drew abreast ; the bicyclist saw a red-flushed face , Bob had a glimpse of a stringy leg and a gold chain , then the bicycle descended a dip in the road . Alone on the highway again Bob squinted at a wadded quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saturn the level land , every inch put to use for crops , oil , gas , cattle , service towns . The ranches were set far back from the main road , and now and then he passed an abandoned house , weather-burned , surrounded by broken cottonwoods . In the fallen windmills and collapsed outbuildings he saw the country 's fractured past scattered about like the pencils on the desk of a draughtsman who has gone to lunch . The ancestors of the place hovered over the bits and pieces of their finished lives . He did not notice the prairie dog that raced out of the roadside weeds into his path and the tires bumped slightly as he hit it . A female red-tail lifted into the air . It was the break she had been waiting for . Bob Dollar was a stranger in the double-panhandle country north of the Canadian River . He had held two jobs in the five years since he had graduated from Horace Greeley Junior University , a hybrid institution housed in a cinder-block building at the edge of an onion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected enlightenment at Horace Greeley , hoped to find an interest that would lead to an absorbing career , but that did not happen and his old doubts about what he should do for a career persisted . He thought a wider educational scope would help and so applied to the state university , but even with a modest scholarship offer ( he had a large vocabulary , good reading habits and exemplary grades ) , there was n't enough money for him to go . Armed with his computer printout diploma from Horace Greeley he found it difficult to land what he thought of as " a good position , " and , finally , rather than work in Uncle Tam 's shop , took a minimum-wage job as inventory clerk for Platte River Lightbulb Supply . After thirty months of toil with boxes and broken glass and miniscule annual raises he had had an unfortunate experience with the company 's president , Mrs. Eudora Giddins , widow of Millrace Giddins who had founded the company . He was fired . And he was glad , for he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightbulbs , as for a report card . He wanted to aim at a high mark on a distant wall . If time had to pass , let it pass with meaning . He wanted direction and reward . There followed five months of job hunting before he was hired on as a location man for Global Pork Rind , headquarters in Tokyo and Chicago , with a field office in Denver . He was assigned to the Texas-Oklahoma panhandle territory and sent out on his first trip for the company . The day before he left , Mr. Cluke 's secretary , Lucille , had flashed him a red smile and waved him into the office . Mr. Ribeye Cluke , the regional operations manager , got up from behind his glass-topped desk , the gleaming surface like a small lake , said " Bob , we do n't have many friends down there in the panhandles except for one or two of the smarter politicians , and because of this situation we have to go about our business pretty quietly . I want you to be as circumspect as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' means ? " His watery eyes washed over Bob . His large hand rose and smoothed the coarse mustache that Bob thought resembled a strip of porcupine . His shoulders sloped so steeply that from behind it looked as though his head was balanced on an arch . " Yes sir . Keep a low profile . " Mr. Cluke picked up a can of shaving cream from the top of the filing cabinet and shook it . From a drawer in his desk he removed an arrangement of braces , straps and fittings and put it over his head so that part rested on his shoulders , and another part that was a large disk against his breast . He tugged at the disk and it opened out on a telescoping arm , becoming a mirror . He applied the shaving cream to his heavy cheeks and , with a straight razor which he took from his pencil jar , unfolded it and began to shave , skirting the borders of the mustache . " Well , that 's good , Bob . Last fellow we thought could scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hospital when he was a baby . So he was no use . But you 're smart , Bob , smart as a dollar , ha-ha . " " Ha-ha , " laughed Bob , who had increased his word power since the age of nine with The Child 's Illustrated Dictionary given him by his uncle Tam . But his laughter was subdued , for he knew nothing of hogs beyond the fact that they were , mysteriously , the source of bacon . " In other words , Bob , do n't let the folks down there know that you are looking for sites for hog facilities or they will prevaricate and try to take us to the cleaners , they will carry on with letters to various editors , every kind of meanness and so forth , as they have been brainwashed by the Sierra Club to think that hog facilities are bad , even the folks who love baby back ribs , even the ones hunting jobs . But I will tell you something . The panhandle region is perfect for hog operations  --  plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good water . There is no reason why the Texas panhandle ca n't produce seventy-five percent of the world 's pork . That 's our aim . Bob , I notice you are wearing brown oxford shoes . " " Yes sir . " He turned one foot a little , pleased with the waxy glint from the Cole Haan shoe which retailed at $300 plus , but which his uncle Tambourine Bapp had fished from a donation box left at the loading dock of his thrift shop on the outer banks of Colfax Avenue . Uncle Tam had raised him . He was a slender , short man with vivid , water-blue eyes , the same eyes as Bob and his mother and the rest of the Bapp clan . Thick greying hair swept back from a square brow . His quick chicken steps and darting hand movements irritated some people . Bob had been a little afraid of him the first week or two because his left ear rode half an inch higher than the right , giving him a crazy , tilted look , but slowly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His uncle 's cropped ear was the result of a childhood injury when his sister Harp cut off the fleshy top with a pair of scissors as punishment for playing with her precious Barbie doll . " He was n't playing ! He was hanging her , " she had sobbed . When he was eight , Bob 's parents had brought him to the thrift shop doorstep very early in the morning , told him to sit there next to a box of dog-eared romance novels . " Now when Uncle Tam gets up and starts slamming things around inside , you knock on the door . You 're going to stay with him . We 've got to run now or we 'll miss the plane . Quick hug goodbye , " said his mother . His father , waiting in the sedan , raised his hand briskly and saluted . Years later Bob thought it might have been the break the old man was waiting for . At first his uncle claimed it was n't abandonment . They were in the kitchen at the table , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viola and Adam to bring you over . The plan was for you to stay with me until they got back from Alaska . After they got their cabin built they were coming back to get you and you were all going to live in Alaska . You staying here was a temporary thing . We just do n't know what happened . Viola called only one time to say they had found some land , but she never said exactly where and there 's no record of it . The pilot that flew them to wherever they went left Alaska and went to Mississippi where he got into dusting crops . By the time we traced him it was useless . He 'd crashed in a cotton field and suffered brain damage . Could n't even remember his own name . Anything could have happened to your mother and father  --  grizzly bear , amnesia . Alaska 's a big place . I do n't for one minute think they abandoned you . " He tapped his fingers on the table , impatient with his own words which sounded stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two grown people to disappear as had Adam and Viola . " Well , what did they do to make a living , " Bob asked , hoping for a clue to his own direction . All he was sure about was that he had n't been important enough to take along . He taught himself not to care that he was so uninteresting that his parents dropped him on a doorstep and never bothered to write or call . " I mean , what was my dad , an engineer , or a computer guy or what ? " " Well , your mother painted neckties . You know the one I 've got of the Titanic sinking ? That 's one of hers . I would say that 's my dearest possession . It 'll be yours someday , Bob . As for your dad , that 's a little hard to say . He was always taking tests to see what he should do with his life  --  aptitude tests . Do n't get me wrong . He was a nice guy , a really nice guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . He had about a hundred jobs before they went to Alaska . And there something happened to them that I 'm sure they could n't help . We do n't know what . I spent a fortune in phone calls . Your uncle Xylo went out there for two months and turned up absolutely nothing except the name of that pilot . Put ads in the papers . Nobody knew anything , not the police , not our family , not a single person in Alaska ever heard of them . So I 'd say you had bad luck with your folks disappearing , losing the chance to get raised in Alaska  --  instead getting brought up by a crazy unrich uncle with a junk shop . " He arched his back and twisted his head , fidgeted with a loose thread on the cuff of his knit shirt . " I suppose the only thing I 'd like to impress on you , Bob , is a sense of responsibility . Viola never had it , and for sure Adam did n't . If you take on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Let your word mean something . It just about broke my heart to see the way you 'd run to the mailbox every day expecting to find a letter from Alaska . Adam and Viola were not what I 'd call responsible . " " It was lucky in a way , " said Bob . The lucky part was Uncle Tam . He read stories to Bob every night , asked his opinion on the weather , on the doneness of boiled corn , foraged through the junk shop detritus for things that might interest . Bob Dollar could n't imagine what his life would have been like in the household of Uncle Xylo whose wife , Siobhan , was an impassioned clog dancer and who ran an astrology business out of their front living room in Pickens , Nebraska . She had a neon sign over the front door with a beckoning hand under the words " Psychic Readings . " " I guess it was n't easy bringing up somebody else 's kid , " he mumbled . The bedtime reading had welded him to Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little apartment when Uncle Tam had turned a page and said the words " Part One : The Old Buccaneer , " Bob had become a sucker for stories told . He slid into imaginary worlds , passive , listening , his mouth agape , a hard listener for whatever tale unfolded . " Ah , you were an easy kid . Except for the library fines . You were always a nice kid , you always pitched in and helped . I never had to worry about phone calls from the cops , drugs , stolen cars , minimart holdups . The only headache you gave me was when you started hanging around with that heavy guy , Orlando the Freak . He was a wrong one . I 'm not surprised he ended up in the pen . I 'm thankful you 're not there with him . " " It 's not like he committed armed robbery or something . It was only computer hacking . " " Yeah ? If you think diverting all the operating funds of the Colorado U.S. Forest Service to a Nevada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for you . " He stretched and fiddled with his cuff , looked at his watch . " It 's almost eleven . I 've got to get back to the shop . " In the early years Bob often felt he was in fragments , in many small parts that did not join , an internal sack of wood chips . One chip was that old life with his parents , another the years with Uncle Tam and Wayne " Bromo " Redpoll , then just Uncle Tam . Another part was Orlando and Fever and weird movies , then the lightbulb time and Mrs. Giddins asking him to massage her feet and her fury when he drew back , gagging , from the stink of clammy nylon . It was true that Bob had always pitched in and helped with dishes and cooking and house chores , largely because he was so ashamed of Uncle Tam 's withering poverty which somehow seemed less if everything was clean and squared up . He would rearrange the books in the bookcases by size and color and Bromo Redpoll , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be such an old lady . " Uncle Tam doted on Bob Dollar but had little to offer as proof of affection beyond solicitous attention and gifts of relatively choice treasures from the thrift shop , including the recent brown oxfords . " Bob ! These look like your size , ten double E. Try em on . In a bag of stuff from some Cherry Creek fat cat . Probably the maid dropped them off . " " They 're great . Now all I need is a sports coat . " In fact the shoes looked odd with Bob 's jeans and T-shirt . " We got no sports coats you 'd be caught dead in , but there is a real nice car coat , suede with shearling lining . Like new , and almost your size . Car coats are kind of old-fashioned now , but it could be useful . You never know . The thing is , it 's a kind of  --  kind of a tan . Come back in the shop and have a look-see . " The car coat was tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no denying , despite the lemony color of a bad dye lot , that it was a well-made garment . He lived in dread that on the street someday the previous owner would recognize the coat and make scathing remarks . It had happened twice in school , once when he wore an argyle sweater , once with a knitted cap , the name CHARLES spelled out on the cuff . He had tried to ink the letters out with a marker but they showed plainly enough . Eventually a large black beret with cigarette burn holes turned up and he wore it for years , telling himself some Frenchman had visited Denver and abandoned it there . " Now , Bob , " said Mr. Cluke , slapping his cheeks with a manly heather aftershave lotion , " you can not go down to Texas wearing brown oxfords . Take my word for it . I 've spent enough time down there to know a pair of brown oxfords can set you back with those people . Despite oilmen trigged out in suits , and wealthy wheat growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the cattleman and the cattleman wants to look like a cowboy . It would n't hurt for you to get a pair of dress slacks and some long-sleeved shirts . But for sure you have got to get yourself a decent pair of cowboy boots and wear them . You do n't need to wear the hat or western shirts , but you got to wear the boots . " " Yes sir , " said Bob , seeing the logic of it . " And Bob , here 's a list of the qualities that I want you to look for  --  on the q.t.  --  in that country . Look for your smaller cow outfits and farms , not the great big ones or the ranches with four hundred oil wells . Look for areas where everybody is grey-headed . Older . People that age just want to live quiet and not get involved in a cause or fight city hall . That 's the kind of population we want . Find out the names of local people who run things  --  bankers , church folks  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears open for farmers whose kids went off to school and those kids are not coming back unless somebody puts a gun to their heads . Read the obits for rural property owners who just died and their offspring are thinking ' show me the money ' so they can get back to Kansas City or Key West or other fleshpots of their choice . " And here 's another thing . You will have to have a cover story because you ca n't go down there and say you 're scouting for Global Pork Rind . Some people would be openly hostile . You will be there off and on for several months at a time , so you will have to think up a story to explain your presence . The fellow we had before told people he was a reporter for a national magazine working on a panhandle story  --  that was supposed to let him get into every kind of corner and let him ask pertinent questions . You know what ' pertinent ' means , do n't you ? " " Yes sir . Pertaining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Very good , I imagine you did well in school . That fellow I mentioned thought it had something to do with hair implants . Anyway , he thought that was a good cover story and expected doors to open to him like butter . " " What magazine did that fellow say he was working for , sir ? Doing the profile for ? " " Well , he did not pick Texas Monthly , thinking the local populace might have heard of it . And of course it would have been folly to name Cockfight Weekly or Ranch News . I believe he said Vogue . He thought he would be safe with that one in the panhandle . " " And it did n't work for him ? " " No , no . It did n't . " Ribeye Cluke 's little finger swept a speck of shaving cream from his earlobe . " You will have to think of something else . I would stay away from the magazine idea , myself . But you 'll think of something . Now , Bob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days until you get your bearings , but your best bet is to rent a room with someone in the area . Find some old lady or elderly couple with plenty of relatives . That way you 'll get a beeline on what 's happening . You 'll get the lowdown . Now you just scour the properties north of the "  --  he consulted the map on the wall  --  " the Canadian River . Scour them good ! Whenever you find a property that looks right and the owner is willing , you let me know and I 'll send our Money Offer Person down . We 've set up a subsidiary company to buy the parcels and then deed them over to Global . The residents do not know a hog farm is coming in until the bulldozers start constructing the waste lagoon . Later , when you 've gained experience , when you 've proved your value to Global Pork Rind , you can act as your own Money Offer Person , though generally we like to send a woman , mention a sum to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to that . Another thing , do n't stay in one place , after a month or so switch to another town . And so forth . That fellow I mentioned ? He picked Mobeetie , so if I were you that 's not where I 'd go . He made people suspicious . He got into trouble . " Lucille here has made up a packet of maps and brochures , county profiles for you , and there 's your corporate credit card  --  and you bet there 's a limit on it , Bob . We need your signature on this card . Here you go then and I 'll just wish you good luck . Report back to me by mail every week . And I do n't mean that damn e-mail . I wo n't touch that . Get a post office box . Write to me at home and I 'll respond from same so your postmaster down there does n't see Global Pork Rind on the envelope and start putting five and five together . I 'll see that the company newsletters are sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too careful . Use a pay phone if there is an emergency . " " Yes sir . " " And remember , the thing that 's really important is that  --  that we  --  that we do what we do . " Bob left with the feeling that Ribeye Cluke was somehow deceiving him . That night he took his uncle Tam to a celebratory dinner at a famous Inuit-Japanese-Irish steak house where they poured melted Jersey butter from quart pitchers , where the baked potatoes , decorated with tiny umbrellas , were the size of footballs and the steaks so thick they could only be cut with samurai swords . His uncle winced at the menu prices , then overpraised the food , a sure sign he was homesick for Chickee 's place down the block from his shop where he could enjoy a plate of fried gizzards or catfish hot pot . But it seemed his thoughts had gone in a different direction , for out on the sidewalk he belched and said , " I 've been thinking of getting into vegetables . Becoming a vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Before I forget . Wayne sent you something . And there 's a little thing from me . " His uncle thrust two flat parcels at Bob . " Do n't open them until you get there , " he said . " Bromo ! I did n't even know you were in touch with him anymore . " " Yeah . I am . We are . Whatever . "
