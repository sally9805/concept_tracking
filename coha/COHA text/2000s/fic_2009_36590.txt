One <p> July 1998 <p> " If only you 'd been born pretty , " Tina Greene said as she glanced at her daughter 's reflection . " Or with only one flaw . Like a big nose . That we could fix . " <p> " As it is , we must suffer with my moderate unattractiveness , " Megan told her mother , going for sarcasm so no one would know how she really felt . Well , most people could guess , but her mother would take the words at face value . To do otherwise would mean giving thought to another person  --  something Tina Greene never seemed to do . <p> " I suppose ' moderate ' covers it , " Tina murmured as she reached for a brush and eye shadow . " On a good day . If only you were more like your sister . Leanne 's only thirteen and she has boys calling here all the time . " <p> Dateless , Megan thought grimly . Eighteen and dateless . " Too bad there 's not a recovery center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over being ugly and not having a boyfriend . " <p> Tina nearly frowned . " Are you being smart with me ? " <p> " No , Mom , " Megan said in her most innocent voice . <p> " There was that one boy . I forget his name . Did n't he end up in prison ? " <p> She refused to answer on the grounds that it was true . Her only boyfriend had been arrested . It was n't his fault  --  at least that 's what she 'd heard . But then she 'd also heard Travis had killed someone . She was n't sure what was the real story . <p> " You did n't even go to your prom , " Tina said . " I could have set you up with someone , but you 'd rather sit home by yourself . Do you know how embarrassing that was for me ? My daughter not going to the prom ? " Tina turned in her chair . " Do you go out of your way to make my life difficult ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Megan stared at her mother . She 'd read about a study that said babies were more likely to look at attractive faces than unattractive ones . If that was the case , she probably had n't slept much as an infant . Her attention would have been riveted on her mother 's perfect face . <p> Through some combination of good genes and great luck , Tina had been born beautiful . Stop-traffic , is-she-really-human beautiful . Dark hair that fell in perfect waves , big green eyes and clear , pale skin that practically glowed . It did n't sound all that amazing in words , but in person , Tina was goddess material . <p> To this day , guys were constantly staring . Men came on to her every time she went out . As her eighteen-year-old daughter , Megan thought it was gross . And depressing . Worse , her baby sister was nearly as pretty . Megan , instead , was the smart sister . <p> Smart and funny , she reminded herself . She had substance . That 's what her dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tina and Leanne were shallow and narcissistic , but they loved them anyway because she and Dad had substance . <p> " What is that you 're holding ? " Tina asked , pointing at the blouse on the hanger . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " It looks like something . Did you make that ? The color does n't work at all on you . Yellow ? Megan , how many times do I have to explain the purpose of clothing ? To enhance what you barely have . Or in your case , make it look like more than it is . " <p> Megan glanced at the yellow thrift-store blouse she 'd bought for three dollars and basically taken apart and put back together so that it looked like a sexy Chanel design . At least that had been the plan . It was pretty enough , and the fit was perfect , but something was missing . Maybe if she changed the buttons ... <p> " I worked on this in my design class today . " <p> Tina sighed and returned to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand why your father indulges you the way he does . You can take all the craft classes you want , but do n't for a minute think you can make a career out of any of them . " <p> " It 's not crafts . It 's fashion design . " <p> " Whatever . Be realistic . I do n't mean to be cruel , but the truth is you 're very unlikely to marry well . You simply do n't have that much going for you . You 'll have to make your own way . You need skills . " <p> The speech was familiar . A variation on the same theme she 'd been hearing for years . Only beautiful women got to marry well . Only beautiful women got to have perfect lives . Lesser mortals simply lived in pain and suffering until they were mercifully put out of their misery by death . <p> Normally Megan could hear the words and let them wash over her without them touching her at all , but not tonight . <p> " You 're wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have talent , and I mean with more than just eyeliner . My teachers say that  --  " <p> Tina rose and tightened the belt on her silk bathrobe . She might have been forty , but she had a body even Megan had to envy . " Your teachers are delighted to cash the checks for the exorbitant tuition they charge at that ridiculous design school . They 're going to say whatever they have to so the money keeps coming . Look at yourself , Megan . You 're a disaster . Those jeans are cut all wrong , your T-shirt has stains on it . Your hair looks like something cats slept in . When you look in the mirror , do you see ' designer ' ? You 're much more the secretary type . Accept that and move on . " <p> I hate you . <p> The words boiled up inside , but years of practice kept them from spilling out . Without saying anything , Megan left her mother 's room and returned to her own . <p> Her friend Allegra was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And ? " <p> Megan tossed the blouse on the floor . " I 'm so stupid . No , what 's beyond stupid ? I got a great verbal score on my SATs . I should know . " <p> Allegra grabbed the blouse and held it to her chest . The buttery yellow shone against her caramel skin . " I love this . You 're doing great work . " <p> Megan joined her on the bed and flopped back on the pillow . " Maybe . " <p> " Hey . " Her friend poked her in the arm . " What happened to all the excitement ? You love design school . You 're going to be a great designer and I will be your star model . Let 's talk about your collection . " <p> " I 'm eighteen and in my first design class . I need to talk about my homework . " <p> " Attack of the Killer Mom ? " <p> " Right to the heart with a quick jab to the creative spirit . " <p> " Want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It 's Friday night . " <p> " He 's old . Like fifty . What else has he got to do ? " <p> Megan laughed . " I 'll be fine . " <p> " Are you sure ? Because I can call . " <p> She probably could . Allegra 's parents were successful professionals who worried about their only daughter 's emotional state . Allegra had been in therapy since she was six . From what Megan could tell , her friend was the most rational , normal , loyal person she knew , but Allegra 's parents did n't see it that way . <p> " I 'm beyond fine . I 'm in a dimension of goodness that requires me to get up off the bed . We 're going to the party . " <p> Allegra groaned and collapsed in a dramatic swoon . Her long , curly hair fell down , covering her face . " No . Please . Anything but that . " <p> " Or we can spend the evening with my mother . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They looked at each other . " We can do this , " Megan said . <p> Allegra nodded . " Oh , sure . I enjoy going places where people will point and stare . " <p> " They do n't do that . " <p> Allegra raised her eyebrows . " I 've seen them . It 's part of my freakishness . " <p> " You 're not a freak . " <p> Her friend stood and put her hands on her hips . " Excuse me ? How many other girls do you know who are six feet tall and weigh four pounds ? " <p> " You weigh more than that . " <p> But her friend was right  --  Allegra was really tall and really thin . And there was something unusual about her face . Huge eyes and wide lips . Cheekbones that seemed on the verge of cutting through skin . <p> " You have a look , " Megan said , meaning it . " One day everyone is going to think you 're amazing and want to be just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> They 'd met in second grade , when Allegra had moved to the neighborhood . She 'd been introduced to the class , and a boy had loudly said the new girl was as ugly as Megan and they should sit together . They did , and a friendship had been born . One bound by time and love and exclusion . <p> " I 'll see what I can do , " Megan told her . " But we are going to that party . " <p> They 'd been invited . At least as much as anyone was ever invited to a big , loud party at the beach . Getting out of the house seemed like the best way to forget how much her mother had hurt her . <p> Megan felt twisted inside . She knew in her head it was because she 'd finished high school and was ready to start college . She was nearly grown up and sometimes , being free and an adult sounded impossibly wonderful . But other times , she wanted to crawl back in bed and hug her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as much to herself as to Allegra . <p> She opened her closet and flipped through the clothes Allegra had left behind on her many sleepovers . She paused at a short red skirt , then tossed it over her shoulder . <p> " That , " she announced . " With the tank top you have on . " <p> " I 'll be naked . " <p> " You 'll be sexy . " <p> " I 'll trip and everyone will see my panties . " <p> " Walk slowly and make sure your underwear does n't have holes . " <p> Megan pulled out the dress she 'd finished over the weekend . The sateen cotton had a sheen that made the really dark green look almost black , but when it caught the light , it flashed with color . The dress was simple and fitted , with skinny straps , but the last six inches of the skirt had a really tight pleating that had nearly killed her to get right . It had come out perfect . <p> " That 's so hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one like it ? " <p> Megan flushed with pleasure . " Sure . We 'll go buy fabric tomorrow . " <p> They dressed , then tried to decide on makeup . A lot ? A little ? It was hard to know what to do . Megan made it a point never to listen when her mother tried to teach her . <p> " Mascara , " Allegra said finally . " And lip gloss . " <p> " Right . We 'll be fabulous . " <p> Her bedroom door burst open and her baby sister strolled in . " Mom 's sick , " Leanne announced , plopping on the bed . <p> " Get out , rodent , " Megan told her . <p> " She has a headache and her heart 's beating too fast . " <p> Megan ignored the knot that formed in her own stomach . Her mother not feeling well often meant pain and suffering for everyone in the house . <p> " Get out of here ! " Megan snapped . " This is my room . " The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " I hate you . " <p> " Back at you . " <p> " I 'm gon na tell Mom . " <p> An old , tired threat . " About what ? " <p> Leanne flipped her long , blond hair over her shoulder and narrowed her big blue eyes . " There 's always something . " <p> The thirteen-year-old left . Allegra stood and smoothed the front of her skirt . " I 'm glad I do n't have a sister . " <p> " I wish I did n't , " Megan said honestly . " She 's so annoying . She snoops in here all the time , trying to find out what I 'm doing . Then she runs to Mom and rats me out . " <p> " Being an only child is a pain , too , though , " Allegra said . <p> Megan rolled her eyes . " Oh , right . Because your parents buy you everything you want . " <p> Allegra 's perfect lips twitched . " They 're concerned . " <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Allegra 's parents , both successful doctors , worried they were gone too much . Attempts to heal came in the form of clothes , shoes , and , since Allegra turned sixteen two years ago , cars . <p> " I 'll trade anytime , " Megan muttered as she brushed her hair . " You can have my rodent sister , my beautiful mother , and my room with a view of the neighbor 's trash can . " <p> " What about your dad and your car ? " <p> " No , you ca n't have either of them . " Megan knew it was n't totally cool to get along with her dad , but she could n't help it . They were practically best friends . And the car had been a graduation present . <p> " Looks like you 're stuck with your life , " Allegra said . <p> " I guess . " <p> " But you can share mine . " <p> " Good to know . " <p> Megan applied another coat of mascara , then stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were both tall and thin with long hair . Megan wrestled with pale skin and freckles , red hair that liked to frizz , and breasts that were smaller than her thirteen-year-old sister 's . Allegra was similarly built but had been spared the freckles . <p> " We are perfect , " Allegra said . " We are confident . We are going to talk to boys at the party and they will talk back . " <p> " Go us , " Megan said . She held up her hand . Her friend did the same and they slapped fingers back and forth three times . <p> They nearly made it down the hall before her mother called , " Megan ? I need to see you . " <p> Megan froze . It was nearly eight . Now that she was out of high school , her curfew had been extended to midnight , which was embarrassingly early for a girl her age . So they did n't have much time at the party . As it was , she was going to drive herself because Allegra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Dealing with her mother could take a couple of hours . <p> But she knew she could n't just walk away , so she sucked in a breath and headed toward the back bedroom . <p> " Yes ? " she said as she stood in the doorway . <p> The large room was dim , the only light coming from the television . Her mother had moved from the vanity to the bed . Her makeup perfect , her hair tumbling artfully , Tina lay on top of the covers , her silk robe draped over her body . She held one hand to her forehead and winced . <p> " I have a headache . Could you get me some ice in a washcloth and make some tea ? My stomach 's not right . It 's stress , of course . You know how the doctor warns me against stress . And maybe you could heat up some soup . " <p> Ten minutes ago her mother had been healthy enough to insult and complain . Megan knew this latest " illness " was a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , doing her best not to whine . Whining only made things worse . " Ca n't Leanne help ? " <p> Her mother nearly frowned . Not that she would  --  wrinkles were bad . " Megan , your sister is just a little girl . You have to be the responsible one . We 've talked about this . " <p> Meaning Leanne was her favorite and excluded from the caretaking . <p> " I was going out , " she repeated quietly , hoping for a miracle . <p> " I do n't see how that 's possible tonight , " her mother told her . " Megan , you know I do n't do this on purpose . Why are you acting like this ? You 're being selfish . If you knew my pain and suffering ... but I pray you never do . " <p> " Because I 'll need all my strength to support myself ? " Megan asked before she could stop herself . <p> Behind her Allegra groaned . " You 're going to pay for that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan could feel it . Some of it she 'd brought on herself and some was just the way things were . <p> She backed out of the room . " You should go , " she told Allegra . " She wo n't let me out tonight . " <p> " I can wait . I 'm not going to the party without you . " <p> " You should . " <p> " Seriously ? Alone ? I 'm going home . " Her friend hesitated . " Or we could go together . Megan , you do n't have to stay . You could move out . She always does this to you . " <p> Technically , maybe . She was eighteen . But go where ? Do what ? She was n't trained to do anything . She wanted to continue her design class and go to college . Her mother or Leanne would simply flounce out , determined to have her own way . Consequences were for other people . As much as Megan wanted to be like that , she could n't helping thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be fine , " Megan said . " I 'll see you tomorrow . " <p> But before Allegra could go , the automatic garage door opener hummed into life . Allegra grabbed her hands . <p> " You 're saved . " <p> Megan grinned and raced toward the kitchen . She kicked off her high heels and flung herself into her father 's arms . <p> " You 're back ! I did n't think you 'd be back until late . " <p> Her father caught her and hugged her hard . " How could I leave my best girl any longer than I had to ? " He released her , then looked her up and down . " That 's some dress . Did you make it ? " <p> Megan spun in a circle . " Every stitch . Is n't it great ? " <p> Her father kissed her forehead . " You look nice . Hey , Allegra . So you girls are going to a party ? " <p> Megan hesitated . " We were . Mom 's not feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For a second her father looked away . Megan often wondered why he stayed married to a woman as horrible as her mother . A woman who demanded and expected , who never said thank you or talked about anyone but herself . But she knew the answer . She could see the light in his eyes when he looked at his wife , heard the pride in his voice when he walked into a room with her on his arm and introduced her as his . <p> Her mother was her father 's greatest flaw . <p> He glanced toward the back of the house , then lowered his voice . " Get out of here , kid . I 'll take care of things with your mom . Be home by one . " <p> Megan blinked at him . " My curfew is midnight . " <p> He shrugged . " It 's summer . Promise you wo n't get wild . " <p> " Oh , Dad , you know I wo n't . I have sewing to do this weekend . I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . That 's just dumb . " <p> Her dad grinned . " How did I get so lucky with my oldest daughter ? " <p> " How did I get so lucky with my dad ? " <p> The familiar exchange made them both laugh . He pointed to the door . " Get out of here before you have to heat soup and run around with ice . " <p> Megan grabbed her shoes . " Love you , Dad . " <p> " Love you , too , Megan . See you in the morning . " <br> <p> The party was in Santa Monica , in a house less than a block from the beach . Megan and Allegra had to park three streets over . The night was warm and clear . They followed the sound of music to the well-lit house , where the crowd had already spilled onto the lawn . <p> " The police will be here by eleven , " Megan told her friend , knowing the extra hour of curfew was n't going to matter tonight . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the loud blast of music . " No one over thirty is that cool . " <p> They went inside and did a slow sweep of the house , checking out who they knew and who they wanted to get to know . Not that they would actually talk to anyone but each other . Megan had never mastered the art of the party , as her mother called it . Small talk with strangers made her nervous . But they were there and it was fun and that was enough . <p> Allegra was on cute boy alert , pointing out possible crushworthy prospects . Megan looked but was n't all that interested . She wanted to work on a pair of tailored pants over the weekend . Once she got them perfect , she could make a pattern , then work with a pinstriped fabric she 'd bought weeks ago . The stripes made for a challenge , but if she pulled it off she could  --  <p> " Ohmigod ! Look ! " <p> Megan turned to glance where Allegra pointed and came to a stop when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I ca n't believe it , " Allegra said . " How long has it been ? Two years ? " <p> Nineteen months , Megan thought as her breath caught in her throat . Give her a minute and she could have actually figured out the number of days . Maybe to the hour . She still remembered everything about the last time she 'd seen him . It had been a Tuesday . She 'd been standing in front of the school when the police had taken him away . <p> The moment had been crazy and blurry , like something out of a movie . She remembered thinking that bad stuff never happened on Tuesdays . It was a stupid day . Not like Monday or Friday . <p> He had n't said anything when they put the handcuffs on him . He 'd stared into her eyes , then looked at her mouth like he wanted to kiss her . He had n't said he loved her or asked her to wait or anything . He 'd been silent and then he 'd been gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A letter , a phone call . There 'd been nothing . And she had n't known if it was okay to get in touch with him . In the end , she 'd done nothing . But she 'd always wondered . <p> Now she stood in the center of the party , not hearing the noise or feeling the crush of the crowd . She was totally alone , like in a bubble , where there were only her memories and the fact that Travis Hunter was back . <p> " Megan ? " Allegra 's voice came from a long way away . <p> Megan could n't seem to answer as she stared at the only guy who could make her forget her dream of being a designer . It was crazy  --  they 'd only gone out for a few months . They 'd barely known each other . She 'd been sixteen and he 'd been her only boyfriend . He 'd been her world , and when he 'd disappeared from it , she 'd wanted to die . <p> Without knowing what she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must have sensed her , because he turned just as she reached him . They stared at each other . <p> His eyes were still dark and looking into them made her want to get lost forever . She did n't think she was breathing , but that was okay , because being close to Travis was enough . His hair was long and shaggy , the way she loved it . The earring was new and made him look like a pirate . He wore a T-shirt over jeans , and stubble covered his chin . Her mother had once described a man as looking like a fallen angel . At the time Megan had thought the description was stupid , but now she got it . Travis was her fallen angel , and if being with him meant going to hell , then she was ready to walk through fire . <p> Unless he 'd forgotten about her . <p> " Megan , " he said , his voice low and thick . The sound of it had always made her tremble . <p> " Travis . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth lifted in his trademark almost-smile . " Out . When did I get out . That 's what you mean . " <p> He was angry  --  she saw that right away . She did n't think it was at her , but maybe it was . Why ? Because he thought she was going to pretend nothing had changed ? Everything had . They 'd both grown up . Him more than her , she would guess . <p> " When did you get out of jail ? " she asked , refusing to let him bait her . " When did you leave prison and come back here ? " <p> He sipped his drink . " A couple of months ago . " <p> Months ? And he 'd never called or tried to see her ? <p> The flash of pain was as bright as it was intense . She 'd missed him , mourned him , wondered if she 'd lost the only boyfriend she would ever have . Which made her feel stupid . Like she 'd been the only one in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked , refusing to let him know any of this bothered her . She had plenty of training for that . <p> " I 'm great . A new man . Reformed . I was a model prisoner . They gave me a plaque . Want to see it ? " <p> Was he trying to hurt her or was that just a happy accident ? " Did you bring it ? " she asked . <p> He shrugged . " You got me . I left it at home . " <p> " Maybe next time . " <p> She stared into his eyes , hoping to see something  --  a hint that she mattered , that he 'd thought of her at least once , that he was happy to see her . There was nothing . Then a tall , pretty blonde with huge boobs walked up and slid her arm around Travis 's waist . <p> " I 'm back , " the blonde said , smiling up at him . <p> " I see . " Travis drew her close , possessively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her an absent smile . " Hi . " <p> Megan felt beyond insignificant . Her cheeks burned and she wanted to die . Worse , she thought she might throw up . Of course Travis was with someone else . That 's what guys like him did . They went out with pretty girls and probably had sex . <p> She was no one . An awkward , unpopular , ugly person who could n't possibly be happy because happiness was saved for the perfect . <p> " Good to see you , " Travis said in obvious dismissal . <p> She nodded , then walked away , her whole body aching . The dress she 'd been so happy to wear seemed stupid . Her shoes pinched her toes and she did n't think she was ever going to be able to smile again . <p> She pushed through the crowd and made her way to the bar , where she asked for a rum and Coke , then took her drink outside . The stars were bright . She could smell the ocean , although she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone joined her on the deck . <p> " Okay , I asked around and her name is Heather . She 's a total ho , " Allegra said . " Nobody dates her , they just sleep with her . He 's been back two months , working at his mom 's business , staying out of trouble . There have been a lot of girls . One night , maybe two , then he moves on . " <p> Megan gulped half her drink , nearly choking as she swallowed . Best friends told you what you needed to know , even when you did n't want to hear it , she reminded herself . Allegra had her back . Now if only someone could protect her heart . <p> " He 's not in love with any of them . Megan , you know that , right ? He was in prison . The man is entitled to a little action after that . " <p> " I understand , " Megan whispered , hoping she did n't sound as broken as she felt . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he 'd asked . But there had n't been time . She 'd just been falling for him when he was taken away . <p> " I hear he has a wicked tattoo on his back , " Allegra said . " A tiger . " <p> " It does n't matter , " Megan said fiercely . " He does n't matter . So we dated and then he was gone . It 's fine . " <p> " He did n't leave you . There 's no closure . You need closure . " <p> Megan looked at her friend . " What ? " <p> " I know about this stuff . You need the ritual of ending things and then you 'll be fine . " <p> " How am I supposed to do that ? " <p> Allegra thought for a second . " I have no idea . " <p> Megan started to laugh . Allegra joined in . They linked arms and went back to the party . <br> <p> Travis watched Megan make her way to the bar for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinker  --  at least she had n't been . Maybe she lived to party now . Who the hell was he to worry about her ? <p> Except she did n't look all that different and she 'd come with Allegra and not a guy . Was she still into clothes ? He would bet that dress she had on was one she 'd made . <p> He remembered a long night when she 'd snuck out and met him . His plan had been to get laid , but she 'd talked about her dreams and the work she 'd done in art class , something about clay and glaze . He had n't been listening to the words , he 'd been lost in the sound of her voice . Then she 'd drawn him and the trees in the park and he 'd learned that he liked watching her talk and sketch more than he liked screwing anybody else . <p> " Are you Travis ? " <p> He looked at the kid asking the question . He was maybe fifteen , skinny , and looked like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . " <p> The kid looked both excited and terrified . " Is it true ? Did you kill someone ? " <p> The truth was Travis had broken up a fight . Some bully had been beating the crap out of a kid as small as the guy in front of him . Travis had stepped in , taken a hit , then decided to teach the bully a lesson . Unfortunately for him , the bully 's mother was on the city council and Travis had ended up getting charged and doing time . <p> At seventeen , he 'd been sentenced as an adult  --  politics-as-usual at work . <p> Until he 'd been taken away in handcuffs , he 'd never believed his old man 's claim that no good deed goes unpunished . He 'd learned it the hard way . <p> But no one wanted to know that . No one wanted to know about what it was really like to be stuck in jail , to have to watch your back so you did n't become some asshole 's bitch . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd vowed to himself he would never be that stupid again , never end up there , never be like his old man . <p> He finished his beer and handed the empty bottle to the kid in front of him . " I killed him , " he lied . " He deserved it . " Then he walked out . <p> He dug in his pocket for his keys . Coming here had been a mistake . Hanging out with people who used to be his friends only reminded him that he did n't fit in anymore , and seeing Megan again had been the worst of it . <p> Did she have to be so damn beautiful ? <p> He 'd nearly made it to his motorcycle when he saw someone sitting on the curb , next to it . It was dark and she was in shadow , but he recognized everything about her . <p> " Where 's your date ? " Megan asked . <p> " She was n't my date . " <p> " Just some girl you 're sleeping with ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Why the questions ? " he asked , wishing she would go away so he could leave . " What do you want ? " <p> " Allegra says I need closure . " <p> " Allegra needs to stop seeing so many therapists . " <p> She picked up the plastic cup she 'd put on the curb , then stood and handed it to him . " Can you toss this ? I do n't know why I got it . I do n't even drink . " She sighed . <p> He poured out the drink and dropped the cup to the grass . She was everything he 'd missed while he 'd been locked up and exactly what he knew he could n't have now that he was out . He 'd done his best to avoid her . And here she was , looking at him like he was still someone who mattered . <p> " Go home , " he told her . <p> " Oh , I will . But I wanted to talk to you first . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was . Torture . It would have been easier if she ripped off his skin and staked him out in the sun . <p> " I do n't want to talk , " he said . " I do n't talk anymore . " <p> " Because you 're big and bad and tough ? " <p> He felt himself start to smile and turned his head so she would n't see . " That 's me . " <p> " Let 's go walk on the beach , " she said . " The fog 's coming in and my hair will frizz , but I do n't care if you do n't . " <p> She reached for his hand . He pulled back . <p> " I 'm not interested in talking , " he growled . " And I 'm not interested in you . " <p> A lie , but the right thing to say . He 'd promised himself that , too . That he would do the right thing . Be a man he could be proud of . <p> Tears immediately filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know what to do . I did n't know if I should write or call your mom . I did n't know what you wanted . So I waited to hear from you . I checked the mail every day for a year . I gave up a year of my life for you , Travis . I waited . Then one day I realized you did n't care . You 'd probably never cared . But I never forgot you . " <p> She brushed away the tears on her cheeks . " I should n't be telling you this . My mother always says never tell a boy what you 're thinking . Leave him guessing . But I missed you and I wanted you to know . There it is . All of it . You can laugh at me , or do whatever it is you want to . Say it and then we 'll be done . " <p> It was like she was naked before him and he did n't know what to do . She 'd waited ? For him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't lie . So now what ? Say what he wanted , what was true ? Or do the right thing ? <p> He shrugged . " I did n't think about you , babe . Sorry you had to waste your time . " <p> Her expression froze , pain etched in her features . Her eyes widened as fresh tears spilled onto her cheeks . <p> " Bastard , " she whispered . <p> " You got that right . " Copyright 2009 by Susan Macias Redmond <br> Continues ...
