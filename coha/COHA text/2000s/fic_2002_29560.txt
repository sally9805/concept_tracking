Chapter One I know where I 'm going . And I know who I want to be . That 's why I took this job in the first place ... and why , four years later , I still put up with the clients . And their demands . And their wads of money . Most of the time , they just want to keep a low profile , which is actually the bank 's specialty . Other times , they want a little ... personal touch . My phone rings and I tee up the charm . " This is Oliver , " I answer . " How can I help you ? " " Where the hell 's your boss ! ? " a Southern chainsaw of a voice explodes in my ear . " E-Excuse me ? " " Do n't piss on this , Caruso ! I want my money ! " It 's not until he says the word " money , " that I recognize the accent . Tanner Drew , the largest developer of luxury skyscrapers in New York City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of high-net-worth individuals , a family office is as high as you get . Rockefeller . Rothschild . Gates and Soros . Once hired , the family office supervises all the advisors , lawyers , and bankers who manage the family 's money . Paid professionals to maximize every last penny . You do n't speak to the family anymore-you speak to the office . So if the head of the clan is calling me directly ... I 'm about to get some teeth pulled . " Has the transfer not posted yet , Mr. Drew ? " " You 're damn right it has n't posted yet , smartass ! Now what the hell you gon na do to make that right ? Your boss promised me it 'd be here by two o'clock ! Two o'clock ! " he screams . " I 'm sorry , sir , but Mr. Lapidus is- " " I do n't give a raccoon 's ass where he is-the guy at Forbes gave me a deadline of today ; I gave your boss that deadline , and now I 'm giving you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss ! ? " My mouth goes dry . Every year , the Forbes 400 lists the wealthiest 400 individuals in the United States . Last year , Tanner Drew was number 403 . He was n't pleased . So this year , he 's determined to bump himself up a notch . Or three . Too bad for me , the only thing standing in his way is a forty-million-dollar transfer to his personal account that we apparently still have n't released . " Hold on one second , sir , I ... " " Do n't you dare put me on h- " I push the hold button and pray for rain . A quick extension later , I 'm waiting to hear the voice of Judy Sklar , Lapidus 's secretary . All I get is voicemail . With the boss at a partners retreat for the rest of the day , she 's got no reason to stick around . I hang up and start again . This time , I go straight to DEFCON One . Henry Lapidus 's cell phone . On the first ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the third , all I can do is stare at the blinking red light on my phone . Tanner Drew is still waiting . I click back to him and grab my own cell phone . " I 'm just waiting for a callback from Mr. Lapidus , " I explain . " Son , if you ever put me on hold again ... " Whatever he 's saying , I 'm not listening . Instead , my fingers snake across my cell , rapidly dialing Lapidus 's pager . The moment I hear the beep , I enter my extension and add the number " 1822 . " The ultimate emergency : 911 doubled . " ... nother one of your sorry-ass excuses-all I want to hear is that the transfer 's complete ! " " I understand , sir . " " No , son . You do n't . " C'm on , I beg , staring at my cell . Ring ! " What time does your last transfer go out ? " he barks . " Actually , we officially close at three ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ... but sometimes we can extend it until four . " When he does n't respond , I add , " Now what 's the account number and bank it 's supposed to go to ? " He quickly relays the details , which I scribble on a nearby Post-it . Eventually , he adds , " Oliver Caruso , right ? That 's your name ? " His voice is soft and smooth . " Y-Yes , sir . " " Okay , Mr. Caruso . That 's all I need to know . " With that , he hangs up . I look at my silent cell phone . Still nothing . Within three minutes , I 've paged and dialed every other partner I have access to . No one answers . This is a hundred-and-twenty-five- million-dollar account . I pull off my coat and claw at my tie . With a quick scan of our network 's Rolodex , I find the number for the University Club-home of the partners retreat . By the time I start dialing , I swear I can hear my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a female voice answers . " Hi , I 'm looking for Henry Lapi- " " If you 'd like to speak to the club operator or to a guest room , please press zero , " the recorded voice continues . I pound zero and another mechanized voice says , " All operators are busy-please continue to hold . " Grabbing my cell , I dial frantically , looking for anyone with authority . Baraff ... Bernstein ... Mary in Accounting-Gone , Gone , and Gone . I hate Fridays close to Christmas . Where the hell is everyone ? In my ear , the mechanized female voice repeats , " All operators are busy-please continue to hold . " I 'm tempted to hit the panic button and call Shep , who 's in charge of the bank 's security , but ... no ... too much ofa stickler ... without the right signatures , he 'll never let me get away with it . So if I ca n't find someone with transfer authority , I need to at least find someone in the back office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver in one ear and my cell in the other , I shut my eyes and listen as his phone rings . Once ... twice ... " I 'm Charlie , " he answers . " You 're still here ! ? " " Nope-I left an hour ago , " he deadpans . " Figment of your imagination . " I ignore the joke . " Do you still know where Mary in Accounting keeps her username and password ? " " I think so ... why ? " " Do n't go anywhere ! I 'll be right down . " My fingers dance like lightning across my phone 's keypad , forwarding my line to my cell phone-just in case the University Club picks up . Dashing out of my office , I make a sharp right and head straight for the private elevator at the end of the dark mahogany-paneled hallway . I do n't care if it 's just for clients . I enter Lapidus 's six-digit code at the keypad above the call buttons , and the doors slide open . Shep in Security would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , I spin around and pound the Door Close button . Last week , I read in some business book that Door Close buttons in elevators are almost always disconnected- they 're just there to make hurried people feel like they 're in control . Wiping a forehead full of sweat back through my dark brown hair , I push the button anyway . Then I push it again . Three floors to go . " Well , well , well , " Charlie announces , looking up from a stack of papers with his forever-boyish grin . Lowering his chin , he peers over his vintage horn-rimmed glasses . He 's been wearing the glasses for years-way before they were fashionable . The same holds true for his white shirt and rumpled slacks . Both are hand-me-downs from my closet , but somehow , the way they hang on his lean frame , they look perfect . Downtown stylish ; never preppy . " Look who 's slumming ! " he cheers . " Hey , where 's your ' I 'm no longer a member of the proletariat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something I 've had to get used to over the past few months . Six months , to be exact-which is how long it 's been since I got him the job at the bank . He needed the money , and mom and I needed help with the bills . If it were just gas , electric , and rent , we 'd be fine . But our tab at the hospital-for Charlie , that 's always been personal . It 's the only reason he took the job in the first place . And while I know he just sees it as a way to pitch in while he writes his music , it ca n't be easy for him to see me up in a private office with a walnut desk and a leather chair , while he 's down here with the cubicles and beige Formica . " Whatsa matter ? " he asks as I rub my eyes . " The fluorescent light making you sick ? If you want , I 'll go upstairs and get your lamp- or maybe I should bring down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Can you please shut up for a second ! " " What happened ? " he asks , suddenly concerned . " Is it mom ? " That 's always his first question when he sees me upset-especially after the debt collectors gave her a scare last month . " No , it 's not mom ... " " Then do n't do that ! You almost gave me a vomit attack ! " " I 'm sorry ... I just ... I 'm running out oftime . One of our clients ... Lapidus was supposed to put through a transfer , and I just got my ass handed to me because it still has n't arrived . " Kicking his clunky black shoes up on his desk , Charlie tips his chair back on its hind legs and grabs a yellow can of Play-Doh from the corner of his desk . Lifting it to his nose , he cracks open the top , steals a sniff of childhood , and lets out a laugh . It 's a typical high-pitched , little-brother laugh . " How can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what you 're worried about ? Some guy did n't get his walking-around money ? Tell him to wait until Monday . " " Why do n't you tell him-his name 's Tanner Drew . " Charlie 's chair drops to the floor . " Are you serious ? " he asks . " How much ? " I do n't answer . " C'm on , Ollie , I wo n't make a big deal . " I still do n't say a word . " Listen , if you did n't want to tell me , why 'd you come down ? " There 's no debating that one . My answer 's a whisper . " Forty million dollars . " " Forty mil ! ? " he screams . " Are you on the pipe ! ? " " You said you would n't make a big deal ! " " Ollie , this is n't like shorting some goober a roll of quarters . When you 're talking eight figures ... even to Tanner that 's not spare change-and the guy already owns half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stops right there-he already knows I 'm wound too tight . " I could really use your help , " I add , watching his reaction . For anyone else , it 'd be a moment to treasure-an admission of weakness that could forever retip the scales between walnut desks and beige Formica . To be honest , I probably have it coming . My brother looks me straight in the eye . " Tell me what you need me to do , " he says . Sitting in Charlie 's chair , I enter Lapidus 's username and password . I may not be squatting at the top of the totem pole , but I 'm still an associate . The youngest associate-and the only one assigned directly to Lapidus . In a place with only twelve partners , that alone gets me further than most . Like me , Lapidus did n't grow up with a money clip in his pocket . But the right job , with the right boss , led him to the right business school , which launched him up through the private elevators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he taught me on my first day , the simple plans work best . I help him ; he helps me . Like Charlie , we all have our ways of getting out of debt . As I scooch forward in the chair , I wait for the computer to kick in . Behind me , Charlie 's sidesaddle on the armrest , leaning on my back and the edge of my shoulder for balance . When I angle my head just right , I see our warped images in the curve of the computer screen . If I squint real quick , we look like kids . But just like that , Tanner Drew 's corporate account lights up the screen-and everything else is gone . Charlie 's eyes go straight to the balance : $126,023,164.27 . " A la peanut butter sandwiches ! My balance is so low I do n't order sodas with my meals anymore , and this guy thinks he 's got a right to complain ? " It 's hard to argue-even to a bank like us , that 's a lot of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank is like saying Einstein 's " good at math . " Greene &; Greene is what 's known as a " private bank . " That 's our main service : privacy-which is why we do n't take just anyone 's money . In fact , when it comes to clients , they do n't choose us ; we choose them . And like most banks , we require a minimum deposit . The difference is , our minimum is two million dollars . And that 's just to open your account . If you have five million , we say , " That 's good-a nice start . " At fifteen million , " We 'd like to talk . " And at seventy-five million and above , we gas up the private jet and come see you right away , Mr. Drew , sir , yes , sir . " I knew it , " I say , pointing at the screen . " Lapidus did n't even cue it in the system . He must 've completely forgotten the whole thing . " Using another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first part of the request . " Are you sure it 's okay to use his password like that ? " " Do n't worry-it 'll be fine . " " Maybe we should call Security and Shep can- " " I do n't want to call Shep ! " I insist , knowing the outcome . Shaking his head , Charlie looks back at the screen . Under Current Activity , he spots three check disbursements-all of them to " Kelli Turnley . " " I bet that 's his mistress , " he says . " Why ? " I ask . " Because she has a name like Kelli ? " " You better believe it , Watson . Jenni , Candi , Brandi-it 's like a family pass to the Playboy Mansion-show the ' i ' and you get right in . " " First of all , you 're wrong . Second of all , without exaggeration , that 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . And third ... " " What was dad 's first girlfriend 's name ? Lemme think ... was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I push my chair back , knock Charlie off the sidesaddle , and storm out of his cubicle . " Do n't you want to hear her turn-ons and turn-offs ? " he calls out behind me . Heading up the hallway , I 'm lost in my cell phone , still listening to recorded greetings of the University Club . Enraged , I hang up and start again . This time , I actually get a voice . " University Club-how may I assist you ? " " I 'm trying to reach Henry Lapidus-he 's in a meeting in one of your conference rooms . " " Please hold , sir , and I 'll ... " " Do n't transfer me ! I need to find him now . " " I 'm just the operator , sir-the best I can do is transfer you down there . " There 's a click and another noise . " You 've reached the University Club 's Conference Center . All operators are busy-please continue to hold . " Clutching the phone even tighter , I race up the hallway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it 's known throughout the bank , is one of the few private offices on the floor and also home to our entire money transfer system . Cash , checks , wires-it all starts here . Naturally , there 's a punch-code lock above the doorknob . Lapidus 's code gets me in . Managing Director goes everywhere . Ten steps behind me , Charlie enters the six-person office . The rectangular room runs along the back wall of the fourth floor , but inside , it 's the same as the cubes : fluorescent lights , modular desks , gray carpet . The only differences are the industrial-sized adding machines that decorate everyone 's desks . Accounting 's version of Play-Doh . " Why do you always have to blow up like that ? " Charlie asks as he catches up . " Can we please not talk about it here ? " " Just tell me why you- " " Because I work here ! " I shout , spinning around . Continues ...              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
