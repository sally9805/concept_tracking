Mrs. Kimble A Novel Birdie Virginia 1969 Charlie 's mother sat cross-legged on the living room floor , her nightgown pulled over her knees , a spill of photographs scattered across the faded carpet . Years later he would remember the sound of the scissors ' blades gnawing into the glossy paper , his little sister Jody wailing in the background , the determined look on their mother 's face . She had been drinking ; her teeth were stained blue from the wine . She worked methodically , the tip of her tongue peeping out the corner of her mouth . The defaced photos she stacked in a neat pile : Christmases , family picnics , Fourths of July , each with a jagged oval where his father 's face had been . One by one she slid the photos back into their frames . She climbed unsteadily to her feet and placed the frames back on the mantelpiece , the sideboard table , the naked hooks dotting the cracked plaster wall . " Better , " she said under her breath . She took Jody by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to his knees and picked through the pile of trash on the floor . He made a pile of his father 's heads , some smiling , some wearing a cap or sunglasses . He filled his pockets with the tiny heads and scrabbled out the back door . His father was there and then he was n't . A long time ago he 'd taken them to church . Charlie could remember being lifted onto the hard pew , the large freckled hand covering his entire back . He remembered playing with the gold watchband peeking out from under his father 's sleeve , and the red imprint it left on the skin underneath . His father had a special way of eating . He rolled back the cuffs of his shirt , then buttered two slices of bread and placed them on either side of the plate . Finally he mixed all his food into a big pile  --  peas , roast , mashed potatoes  --  and ate loudly , the whole meal in a few minutes . Charlie had tried mixing his own food together , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him once they touched , and his mother got mad at the mess on his plate . His father made pancakes , and sucked peppermints , and whistled when he drove them in the car . On the floor of his closet , he kept a coffee can full of change . Each night lying in bed , Charlie would wait for the sound of his father emptying his pockets into the can , nickels and dimes landing with recognizable sounds , some tinny , some dry and dusty . It was always the last thing that happened . Once he heard the coins fall , Charlie would go to sleep . Birdie was unwell . It was mid-morning when she opened her eyes , the room filled with sunlight . She rolled over and felt a sharp pain over her right eye . The other side of the bed was still made , the pillow tucked neatly under the chenille spread . She had remained a considerate sleeper , as if her sleeping self had n't yet figured out that the whole bed was hers alone . She lay there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her childhood . In the dream she was small , younger than Charlie ; she and Curtis Mabry , the housekeeper 's son , had hidden in the laundry hampers . " You nearly give me a heart attack , " said the housekeeper when she discovered them . " You 're lucky I do n't tell your mother . " Through the thin walls she heard movement , the bright tinkling music of morning cartoons . She lifted herself out of bed , her nylon nightgown clinging to her back . In the living room the children looked up from the television . " Mummy , " Jody squealed , springing off the couch and running to hug her leg . She wore shortie pajamas , printed with blue daisies . Birdie wondered for a moment who 'd dressed the child for bed . She could n't remember doing it herself . " Can I go outside ? " said Charlie . He lay sprawled on the rug , too close to the television . " May I go outside please , " she corrected him . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in socks and sneakers . The screen door spanked shut behind him . Birdie unwrapped Jody 's small arms from her leg . " Let me get you some breakfast , " she said . The children seemed to lie in wait for her , to ambush her the moment she crawled out of bed , full of energy and raging needs . At such times it could be altogether too much  --  her stomach squeezed , the sign of a rough morning ahead  --  for one person . She took Jody into the kitchen . It was a point of pride for Birdie : her kitchen was always immaculate . The room simply was n't used . She had n't cooked in weeks , had n't shopped except for brief trips to Beckwith 's corner store , to buy wine and overpriced loaves of bread . She found the box in the cupboard and poured the cereal into Jody 's plastic bowl , decorated with pictures of a cartoon cat . She opened the refrigerator and a sour smell floated into the kitchen . The milk had spoiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ought to pour it down the drain , but the very thought of sour milk turned her stomach ; she left the carton where it was . She eyed the wine bottle corked with a paper napkin . Beside it an unopened bottle , the one she had n't got to last night . She closed the door . " Looks like it 's toast for us , " she said . She put two slices of bread in the toaster . She had n't finished the bottle , so why did she feel so wretched ? On Sunday night she 'd had two full bottles , and not so much as a headache when she woke the next morning . The toast popped , the sound a jolt to her heart . Perhaps she had n't overindulged , just consumed unwisely . She 'd already learned that red wine hit her hardest , that a small meal  --  toast or crackers  --  cushioned the stomach and allowed her to drink more . Beyond that , the workings of alcohol were still a mystery . It seemed to hit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could n't imagine . She wondered if this were true for other women . She had no one to ask . Her mother was dead , and anyway had never touched anything stronger than lemonade . Her father 's new wife probably did drink , but Birdie could n't imagine talking to Helen about this or anything else . " Butter ? " Jody asked . " Sorry , button . " Birdie spread the bread with grape jelly and thought of the wine . She would have been married eight years that Tuesday . Mrs. Kimble
