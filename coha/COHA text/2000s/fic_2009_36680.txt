Peshawar , North-West Frontier Province , Pakistan <p> Nicholas Sunder should not have been surprised when he heard the knock on his hotel room door . For Nick was not a man blessed with great luck . He had no choice but to open it , for whoever was in the hallway would have been told by Shahid , the receptionist , that he was in . He glanced at his watch , envisioning himself sitting anonymously on an eastbound minibus packed with raucous Pakistanis , and cursed himself for not leaving half an hour earlier . Shutting his eyes , he inhaled deeply to garner his wits . Then he opened the door . <p> Standing in the doorframe was a barrel of a man with a flat head perched atop a trunklike neck . His face , dark and pitted , was bisected by flaring mustaches , and punctuated with obsidian eyes . He wore the distinctive sky blue uniform of the Peshawar police . <p> " Yes ? " Trying his best to comes across as confident , Nick overcompensated , and his voice sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer , who scrutinized Nick briefly before stepping aside to reveal a partner . Bespectacled , lithe , with sensitive eyes , this second man was at least ten years younger than the larger one  --  perhaps in his midthirties  --  not much older than Nick . But his dark skin and jet-black hair contrasted starkly with the pastel blue of his uniform , making him appear even younger . <p> " Mr. Sunder ? " said the corpulent officer in Punjabi-accented English . " I am Inspector Rasool Muhammad Akhtar with the Investigation Wing of the Peshawar Police . " His voice was gruff from excessive smoking , devoid of the soothing lilt so often characteristic of subcontinentals . " And this is Sub-Inspector Abdul Shiraz . " He gestured openhandedly to his younger partner , who greeted Nick with a smile too congenial to be genuine . <p> There was a long silence  --  too long , it seemed to Nick  --  as he waited for the inspector to speak . " Well ? " Nick said finally . " You speak English , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " said Akhtar in a tone that implied he was not asking . <p> Nick hesitated . " Okay , " he replied , " but I 'm busy at the moment . If you could come back later ... in a couple of hours or so , I 'd be happy to  --  " <p> " It is urgent , " chimed in Shiraz from behind his boss , Akhtar . <p> Nick paused , wiping the sweat from his forehead . He nodded , then stepped out into the hallway to avoid letting them into his room . But Akhtar shuttled toward Nick like a bulldozer , forcing him to backpedal awkwardly . As Akhtar passed through the door , he propped it open , permitting Shiraz to follow . <p> The inspectors scanned the room , their eyes settling on Nick 's packed rucksack . " Where are you going , sir ? " said Akhtar . " Home to America ? " <p> " No . To India . Amritsar . " <p> " When ? " <p> " My bus leaves in forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet you ask us to return in a couple of hours ? Either you are being very rude , or are you hoping to leave Pakistan without speaking to us . " <p> Realizing his error , Nick became aware of the hot blood rushing into his face . " I apologize . My mistake . It 's this heat  --  it 's driving me mad , " he demurred , forcing a cordial smile to no effect . <p> Akhtar studied Nick , then pointed to a wooden luggage rack bestrewn with clothes  --  a woman 's clothes : underwear , smallish socks , cutoff T-shirt . " To whom do these belong ? " <p> " A friend of mine , " Nick replied . <p> Akhtar plucked a pair of T-back panties from the pile . Dangling the lingerie between his thumb and forefinger , he extended his arm stiffly in front of him . <p> " A female friend , " Nick clarified . <p> " Friend , " Akhtar muttered . " We do not have female friends in Pakistan . We have wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the others are trouble . " <p> Nick nodded halfheartedly , unsure whether the comment was intended as a joke . Then he shrugged his shoulders . " I 've prepaid for my ticket . I 'd appreciate it if you 'd tell me what this is about , so I do n't miss my bus . " <p> Inspector Akhtar stepped toward the American with a swagger that indicated his girth was an advantage  --  not an impediment . " This is , in fact , about your girlfriend . " <p> " She 's not my girlfriend . " <p> The inspector weighed Nick 's remark with doubtful eyes . To Akhtar , the handful of intrepid backpackers who still came to Peshawar each year despite the volatile political climate , with their long hair or modish shaved heads , tight clothing , and appetite for hashish , epitomized the depravity of the West . Nick and the girl were sharing a room ; ergo , they were carnal . <p> " Very well , " he said . " Her name is ... Yvette Dee ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you . English I can speak . But French ? So many letters that have no meaning . So , where is the girl now ? " inquired Akhtar in a manner that suggested he already knew the answer . <p> " Last time I saw her was yesterday morning . Why , is something wrong ? " <p> " You are the one who has not seen her since yesterday . You tell us . " <p> Nick felt weak . He sat down on the bed , staring blankly at the wall . When Shiraz finally saved him from his trance , he had no idea how long he had been suspended in dumbfounded silence . " Why , sir , did you not call the police when she failed to come back to the room ? " Shiraz asked . <p> " I , um ... I do n't know .... I just figured she was staying with a friend  --  another traveler maybe , " Nick said . " I was n't her only friend . " <p> " You see ?  --  trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us  --  there will be no bus for you today . " <p> The pungent stench of decaying bodies burned Nick 's nostrils as Akhtar swung open the double doors . The morgue was nothing more than a large , cement-walled room with bodies laid at odd angles upon the floor . The corpses were wrapped in white sheets knotted over the faces , some stained with dried blood . Others , the ones that buzzed with the most flies , were moist from large slabs of melting ice wedged underneath them . <p> " Follow me , " Akhtar said , casually stepping over the corpses . Nick did not want to follow , not only because he felt it to be somehow disrespectful and unlucky to step over the dead . At his very core , he feared what they had brought him there to do . But when he turned back and saw Shiraz behind him , urging him onward with a stern nod , Nick knew he had to show them he could go through with it , if had he any hope of getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his brow , covered his nose and mouth in a futile attempt to ward off the stench , and then stepped across the bodies to where Akhtar was standing . At Akhtar 's feet lay a sheeted bundle labeled with a piece of masking tape with red Urdu script written on it . Akhtar squatted to untie the sheet . <p> Nick felt the room spin . He began to topple . " Sir ... " said Shiraz behind him , reaching for Nick 's arm . <p> Nick grabbed Shiraz 's elbow , barely avoiding a fall . Vomit welled at the back of his throat . He forced it back down , nearly gagging . He breathed deeply for several moments , until he was sure he had regained his legs . " Is this ... really necessary ? " <p> " I am afraid so , " Akhtar replied . " We tried to locate her parents through the French embassy in Islamabad , but the authorities are very slow to find them . We are concerned that by the time they are located , the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body to the central morgue in Islamabad , but ... well , it will take time to process . So ... unless you happen to know where her parents live ? " <p> Nick rubbed his temples , trying to focus his thoughts . He spoke through his hand , cupped over his mouth and nose . " She 'd lived in Paris , she told me . But I do n't know about her parents . Small town , maybe . I do n't think she was close to them ... just the impression I got . " <p> Akhtar eyed Nick . " Then we have no choice but to proceed . " With a sort of unseemly gusto , he tugged sharply at the ends of the sheet , peeling them open to reveal its contents . <p> Nick clenched his eyes shut . He had seen more than a few dead bodies in his life , and not just the well-manicured corpse of his father at his open-casket funeral , all signs of his slow death by cancer concealed under a thick mantle of cosmetics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much so that it seemed to Nick very much a part of life , not merely the end of it . For some reason , be it morbid curiosity or a deeper yearning to comprehend this strange , fatalistic world , Nick had found himself during his travels gravitating toward places where the worlds of the living and the dead collided . He had gone out of his way to view bodies burned on wood-fueled funeral pyres in Katmandu , bloated corpses of the snake-bitten ritually dumped into the Holy Ganges , and Tibetan " sky burials " in which leathery-skinned nomads chopped their ancestors into fist-sized chunks for the vultures to devour . But this was different . This was life he had coveted , a body he had known intimately , over which he had run his fingers until every freckle , curve , and recess of skin had been impressed in his memory . He struggled to numb his emotions , to force his mind to perceive what he was about to see as a mere phenomenon , another stop along on his journey to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the body , he could do nothing but stare , speechless , feeling as though the small hole of emptiness in his chest that had always been there had opened to swallow the entirety of his being . He felt like nothing . He felt like he was dead . <p> " Well ? " said Akhtar , eyeing Nick closely . " Is this your lady friend ? " <p> Nick did not register the inspector 's words . Yvette looked just the way he remembered her . Her torso , exposed through the tears of her dirt-stained shirt , was unbloated ; her breasts , though waxen , were still smooth and flawless . A blond tousle of her hair splayed across her cheek . Her feet , striped with the tan lines of sandal straps , were still embellished with the lavender toenail polish Nick had painted on for her days ago . And her eyes , like limpid pools of trapped sky , were placid and beautiful as they had been in life . One might have thought she had died in peace , were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Sir ... is this her  --  Ms. DePomeroy ? " <p> " Yes , " said Nick finally , nearly choking on his words , his eyes blurring with tears . " Yes , it is . " <p> " Such a beautiful girl , " Shiraz interjected with melancholy . " Some goatherders found her in the Tribal Areas , near a jeep trail off the road from Landi Kotal  --  in an area where Westerners are forbidden . Do you know how she might have gotten there ? " <p> Nick shook his head no . Wiping his eyes , he turned from the body . " Please ... I 've seen enough . " <p> " As you wish , " said Shiraz . <p> But as Nick headed for the door , Akhtar called out brusquely  --  " One more thing "  --  stopping Nick in his tracks . <p> " What do you make of this ? " Akhtar motioned to Shiraz , who rolled the body onto its side . The smooth , narrow back was pocked with deep contusions of bluish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal prod . <p> Nick could glance only briefly before shielding his eyes . " I would n't know , " he said . He stood there a moment , distracted by a loud pounding behind his ears , as if someone were thrashing the back of his head . Until he realized it was his own blood surging to his brain . <p> Sub-Inspector Shiraz followed Nick out of the morgue . " Please , sir  --  just a few more questions , " he said , as they waited for Akhtar to wrap up the body and rejoin them . Because of his younger age , Shiraz  --  unlike his superior , Akhtar , who had been robbed of all compassion by his years of exposure to drug smugglers , terrorists , and corrupt bureaucrats  --  had not yet lost his ability to empathize . This was evident in the way he stared at Nick with rueful eyes , as if beseeching him to confess for the sake of his salvation . <p> " Questions ... " repeated Nick . He felt as though Shiraz 's words were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , where he was struggling to keep his head from sinking into icy blackness . <p> " Sir , a young woman has been murdered . We need a little more information ... to guide our investigation . Her family will wonder , when we find them . It is their right to know . " <p> " Yes ... yes , of course , " Nick replied . " I 'll help any way I can . But ... I 'm afraid I did n't know her that well . We were rooming together just for convenience . Budget travelers do that  --  join up on the road , share accommodations to split costs . I think I pretty much told you everything I know about her already ... <p> " I do need to get to Delhi by Friday to catch my flight home  --  people are expecting me , " he added . This was a lie . Nick had no intention of going back home to America , at least not right away . His father had died when he was a teenager and his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no siblings or other close living relatives who might raise a fuss through political channels ; nor , for that matter , any loved ones who might even notice him missing . He was an expatriate in the profoundest sense  --  a man alone in the world . And now , for the first time , his total independence made him feel more vulnerable than free . His instinct told him it would be better to make the inspectors think he knew people who would press the authorities if he were held up for too long . <p> " It is required procedure . Just a brief statement . Then you may go . " <p> Statement . The legalistic nature of the word did not sit well with Nick . " Just so I 'm clear , you mean ... if I tried to walk out the door right now , you would detain me ? " <p> Sub-Inspector Shiraz gave a sigh of frustration . " Come , sir . It is better for everyone that you cooperate . Surely I need not remind you how simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa . " <p> They led Nick into a so-called conference room  --  a bleak chamber with a cement floor and walls of cinder block partially covered with crumbling plaster . In one corner stood a wooden table flanked by roughly hewn chairs . The only other furnishing was a steel toilet bowl fixed to the wall . It was swarming with flies , and so besmirched with mold and excrement it appeared not to have been cleaned since the days of the British Raj . A thick steel slab of a door contained the only window , and the interior of the chamber reeked of urine . <p> Shiraz urged Nick to sit and demanded his passport . During his more than two years backpacking through the remote , sometimes dangerous parts of Asia , Nick had stuck to a policy of never letting his passport out of his control . Like a soldier terrified of losing his talisman , he felt he could defy great odds so long as it was in his possession  --  in his money belt , around his neck , or buried in his underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these were the police  --  he had no choice but to provide proof of his identity . Nick opened his passport to the photo page and slid it across the table , pinning it there with his fingers for the inspectors to review . But Akhtar snatched it up , before signaling toward the open door for a third policeman , who entered and left with it . <p> " Wait ! " Nick protested . " Where 's he going with that ? " <p> " It will be safe , sir , " said Shiraz . " I assure you . " <p> Shiraz sat down opposite Nick . Akhtar propped himself , arms folded , on the table to Nick 's left . Even though Shiraz was doing the talking , it was clear by the way Shiraz kept petitioning Akhtar with his eyes that the elder was in control . <p> " When was the last time you saw the deceased ? " asked Shiraz . <p> " Around ten o'clock yesterday morning . We had breakfast at the hotel . After that , we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... well , now . " <p> " What did you and the girl discuss over breakfast ? " <p> Nick shrugged his shoulders . " Small talk  --  our impressions of Peshawar , stuff like that . We mentioned our travel plans . I told her I was going to leave for Lahore , then head into India . She said she was going to stay in Peshawar . " <p> " And you argued about this ? " <p> " No . It was n't like that . " <p> " But you must have been upset she did not want to come with you ? " <p> Nick looked into Shiraz 's eyes . " I 'm not sure what you 're trying to imply ... but I do n't appreciate it . " <p> " No one is pointing any fingers , sir , " Shiraz replied without flinching . " We are only trying to get to the bottom of a vicious crime . It is important for us to know the victim 's state of mind . Whether she was upset , excitable , panicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . It 's just , this whole thing  --  her murder , having to identify her body  --  it 's a total shock to me . And now to feel like I 'm being interrogated or something .... It 's not the treatment one expects as a visitor , " said Nick , hoping to tap into the Pakistani sense of hospitality , which he had come to learn was a matter of creed . The inspectors ' expressions , however , did not change . <p> " As I was saying before , " Nick continued , his nerves forcing his words to come out in clipped phrases . " Our relationship was casual . We met in Kashgar . We were both planning to head down the Karakoram Highway to Islamabad , and then go to Peshawar . It made sense to join up for a while . Friendship is cheap on the road . You meet someone , travel together for a week or two . And never see them again . There 's no hard feelings . It happens all the time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed very ... emotional , " Shiraz said . " Like you knew her much better than you are suggesting . " <p> Nick lowered his chin . " No , " he said in a faltering voice . He pinched the bridge of his nose between his eyes , gathering his composure . " It 's just ... it 's a horrible thing , what happened to her . Even if I did n't know her that well . " <p> Shiraz and Akhtar glanced at each other , their own silent language . " Did the girl say what she was going to do after breakfast ? " Shiraz continued . <p> " She said she was going back to the hotel . " <p> " And after breakfast , what did you do then ? " <p> " Toured the cantonment , wandered the bazaars . I did n't return until evening . When I got back , she was n't there . " <p> " When she did not come back for the night , you said she was with a friend ? " <p> Nick hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other day she mentioned she had come across some people in the bazaar  --  some other backpackers she 'd met a few months ago on the circuit  --  Goa , Katmandu , I 'm not sure exactly . At breakfast she said something about meeting someone for tea that evening . When it got late , I figured she must have decided to stay over with whomever she 'd met , instead of walking back alone after dark . They say it 's not a good idea for a Western woman to be alone in the bazaar at night . " <p> " Do you have a name or nationality ? " said Shiraz . <p> Nick shook his head . " I 'm a little older than most backpackers . I had no interest in meeting any more university dropouts with wanderlust . I did n't ask . " <p> Shiraz considered Nick 's words , tapping his ballpoint pen on the table . " May we ask what are you doing in Peshawar , sir ? Your country has been dropping bombs just across the border in Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . In Bajaur , for example , not more than two hundred kilometers from here , your air force shot a missile at a madrassa and killed eighteen children . They said they were after senior al Qaeda . In a school for young boys ? There was n't even a pilot in the plane to see what he was shooting at . It was one of your ... what do you call them ... drones . Like some kind of computer game . " <p> Nick remembered seeing the bloody news clips on Pakistani television of the crushed , blue-lipped children , their wailing , veiled mothers kneeling over the bodies , pounding their chests and pulling their hair . The U.S. government had denied the strike in Pakistani territory . Yvette had been with him . She was brought to tears by the images of the dead and dying children , and cursed Nick in anger , as if he were somehow responsible for his government 's actions . " The French are fighting in Afghanistan , too  --  how do you know it was n't the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick out of the bed that night . A few weeks later , the U.S. government 's official denial was recalled . The incident had been placed " under investigation , " which more often than not was the prelude to an eventual admission of responsibility forced under the pressure of incontrovertible evidence . <p> Nick lowered his eyes . " I did n't know that , " he lied . <p> Shiraz frowned . " You must not read the newspapers , " he said , his tone sardonic . " Many people here have fled from the fighting . They still have relatives across the border . They are angry at being bombed by your country for the actions of a few . They do not like America for this . Not at all . And I can not remember the last time we saw an American tourist in Peshawar . A few Europeans , Japanese , Australians  --  but very few of even them . The only Americans in Peshawar are spies . " <p> " I do n't know what to say , " said Nick after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . I wanted to see Peshawar . And there was n't any rule against me coming . Maybe some people here are opposed to America and the war . I understand that . But I figured Pakistan and America are allies , right ? Look , all I really want to do at this point is leave . Please . " <p> Shiraz smiled ironically . He gathered his notes . <p> " Are we through ? " Nick asked . Ignoring the question , the inspectors made for the door , slamming it shut behind them . Nick heard the bolt slide . <p> " Hey ! " he cried . Nick ran to the door . He pounded on the thick steel with the heel of his fist . Peering out the small window at the door 's center , a Plexiglas porthole wide enough for a single face , he sought to make eye contact with someone  --  anyone  --  watching from the other side . But the only figure staring back at him was a reflection of himself . <p> He studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury in the low-budget hostels and guesthouses at which he had been staying , and he was shocked at how much he had changed since crossing into Pakistan months ago . He was only thirty-three years old , but the thorny beard he had grown made him look nearly forty . His dark hair hung down to his shoulders . Creases stretched like spokes from the corners of his eyes . Once well muscled , he had lost nearly twenty pounds over the past year , and his veins swelled under the taut hide of his hands . He ran his fingertips over the lines of sinew etched into his neck . Though his beard grew thickly across his sunburned face , it did nothing to disguise the fear in his eyes . <p> He turned away from the window . His back sliding against the door , he let gravity pull him down to a crouch . A roach scampered across the floor . Sweat rolled down from his scalp , stinging his eyes . He clutched his head in his palms and waited . <p> As he sat alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yvette 's corpse . Her body had appeared fresh , mercilessly intact , despite the stench of the morgue . Were it not for the hideous wound across her neck , he might have imagined her waking from a long slumber . The fact that he could not drive the image from his mind , even after such a horrible death , struck Nick as a proof that Yvette 's beauty had been her curse . <p> He remembered the first time he saw her . He had been wandering the ghats along the holy lake in Pushkar , India , when he spotted her surrounded by a troop of frenetic monkeys wielding garlands of flowers . With her light blond hair , short-trimmed to an epicene bob , she could have been mistaken for a boy at first glance were it not for her tapered waist and girlish hips . A flash of her profile revealed high cheekbones and a thin nose , slightly too long for her almond face and full lips . She wore a red tank top that clung to compact breasts , and khaki pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched tightly around thighs as thin and smooth as her calves . <p> " They are clawing me  --  get them off ! " she had cried to the young Rajasthani , one of the many hustlers who trained their monkeys to harass tourists with puja flowers until they would agree to buy them at extortionate prices . Her boyfriend , Simon , a lanky Englishman in his midtwenties with shoulder-length hair and a downy Vandyke , rolled in laughter nearby as Yvette cursed in French and swiped at the screeching primates leaping onto her shoulders . To Nick , however , her panic was too real to be humorous . He ran toward her , pelting the animals with rocks . The Rajasthani , angry at the assault on his livelihood , stepped toward Nick with a club , only to retreat when Nick , a larger man , cocked his fist . Afterward , perhaps to make a point of Simon 's less chivalrous response , Yvette thanked Nick by buying him a Kingfisher at one of the lakeside bars . <p> Nick had been instantly drawn by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cigarette smoke and anti-American sarcasm . By the time he arrived in India , he had already traipsed through Australia and Southeast Asia . Australia had been unremarkable , America with marsupials and more desert . But Southeast Asia , especially Cambodia and Vietnam , with its overgrown temples , lantern-laden alleyways , and stunning brown-skinned girls , had hooked him . At times he felt he could travel forever , staying in one country or another until he desired someplace new . However , after some six months , he started to become road-weary , alienated , tired of communicating in phrasebook terminology and improvised sign language . And worst of all , he lived in fear that the indefinable emptiness from which he had fled , which he had hoped somehow to leave behind in America , was still there inside him , a sore that would bleed again as soon as the scab of diversion was torn off . <p> When Nick met Yvette and Simon in Pushkar , he found their energy to be infectious , reinvigorating , filling the vacuum caused by his loneliness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple who had been traveling alone together for over a year . After having no one with whom to share his experiences for so long , he craved their company , despite his being more than ten years their senior . So , when they invited him to join them , he gladly accepted , and the three of them traveled together through India , Nepal , and Tibet . <p> Yvette and Simon had made friends everywhere , frequently running into people they had met on the road  --  Katmandu , Varanasi , Yangshao , Hanoi , Bangkok , everyone passed through Bangkok . Over beer and hashish , they would talk all night , swapping adventures and theories of life , always looking forward to the next journey , be it one of pleasure or travail . Because Simon and Yvette were perpetually running out of money , they traveled by the cheapest means possible  --  hitching rides on cargo trucks , perched atop buses , or packed in sweaty train cars with the masses . Nick , for his part , had enough money that he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on his occasional trips to banks and American Express offices to stock up on cash whenever they were in larger cities . His savings , however , left over from his years of gainful employment as a lawyer in America , were not as much as he would have liked , and constantly dwindling . Nonetheless , he never felt exploited when , tired of budget accommodations , he covered their costs for a splurge  --  a good meal , a comfortable train , or a hotel with hot water . When Simon and Yvette slept together at night , Nick would hide his jealousy as best he could  --  and sex came easily enough with other freethinking backpackers , which , to Nick 's satisfaction , would sometimes make Yvette suffer a little jealousy of her own . <p> Despite all the time he spent with them , Nick learned little about their pasts , other than where they hailed from and where they had traveled . As with most long-term Western travelers , what one did back home was irrelevant and rarely came up . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had done virtually nothing in their home countries before traveling  --  no jobs , no children , no university training  --  and their lives were cut wholly from the fabric of their journeys as they went . This might have been the case with Yvette and Simon . But then , what had Nick actually done that had any genuine meaning ? <p> Nick , who had always felt himself too guarded by nature , envied Simon for his dauntless sense of adventure and his seemingly effortless ability to bridge cultures with little more than a good-natured slap on the back and the offer of a cigarette . And Yvette was unlike the girlfriends he had known in America , who might have fancied themselves as " independent " but were nothing of the sort . She was a maverick , bent on forging her own path , her ultimate goal being nothing more than the journey itself . Always on the move , never succumbing to pressure or guilt , she seemed disappointed only by the lost opportunity to try something new , to see a new place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in Lhasa , for reasons unexplained , Simon ran off to Southeast Asia with an Israeli girl . Notwithstanding all of Yvette 's Buddhism-inspired proclamations about not becoming " attached " to anything in life , she brooded for days . Until a few weeks later , on their first night in Kashgar , she slipped into Nick 's room . <p> Nick and Yvette continued to travel alone together , sharing the same bed for three months , before they received a telegram from Simon at Chinar Bagh Hotel in Kashgar . It was from Rangoon , and it said to meet him in Peshawar . <p> The steel door swung open , startling Nick back to the present . He scrambled to his feet as Akhtar and Shiraz marched into the cell . " I want to call my embassy , " Nick insisted . <p> " That is not possible , " Akhtar replied . " Now , sit . " <p> Nick 's eyes moved from Akhtar to Shiraz . " There 's got to be some rules in this country , " he rejoined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Sit ... down ! " Akhtar bellowed , his words riding on a gust of foul breath . <p> Nick slowly slid back into his chair . He fixed his eyes on the table and waited for Akhtar 's anger to ebb . Then , out of pure desperation and fear , he did the only thing he could think of at that moment . He gambled . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Nick said , his voice trembling . " Please believe me . I 'm trying to help . I just do n't understand what more you want from me . " Nick glanced up at Akhtar . He was staring back at him , his eyes black and impatient . <p> " Please do n't take this the wrong way , " Nick continued with caution , " but ... well , I feel I should tell you something . Something you might want to know . I know a lot of people  --  some important people  --  in America . If I do n't leave Peshawar today and I miss my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that happens , well , it might not look so good for you ... for your careers . " <p> Akhtar hit him . His huge hand swooped across the table , crashing hard against Nick 's temple . Nick 's vision whirled in a flash of lights , and when it settled he was on the floor , his chair lying over his legs . Akhtar 's face hovered above , bloated with rage , his open mouth daubed with spittle . <p> " You think we treat you special because you are American ! " <p> " Fuck you , " Nick heard himself say , his own words barely audible above the buzzing in his ears . He had no cognizance of his execution of the words , only that they were said . It was as if some other person had momentarily possessed him , acted on impulse , and then vanished , leaving him to suffer the outcome alone . <p> There was a blur of confusion . Nick felt himself being dragged , then thrust downward , a viselike grip clutching the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pushed against the floor , the muscles of his neck straining in effort to crane his head from the rank void of the toilet . But the force and weight pressing down were too much . <p> He felt the dull snap of his septum . Blood welled at the back of his throat . Feculent sludge seeped into his mouth . His arms grew heavy . He felt himself slipping into blackness , drowning in piss and shit and his own blood . <p> Nick was nearly unconscious when Akhtar dropped his head onto the cement . Dripping with foul water , he vomited until nothing came up but blood and sputum . <p> The inspectors watched Nick gasp on the floor . Akhtar kicked him in the ribs . He cried in pain . He tried to crawl away , but Akhtar grabbed the back of his shirt , hauling him to his knees . <p> Akhtar took a handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped it around his knuckles . When he was done , he clutched Nick 's chin in his thick palm , forcing Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shutting his eyes , Nick braced for the blow . He would be killed right here , he thought , and nobody would ever know .
