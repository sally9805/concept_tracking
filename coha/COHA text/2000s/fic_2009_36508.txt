Bird-of-Paradise <br> ( Strelitzia reginae ) <br> Native of South Africa , member of the banana family , <br> prized for its tall , highly colored structures . <br> This plant is not for the easily disappointed , impatient , or bossy , <br> as it can take seven years to produce a single bloom . <br> Perfect for the person who gives and gives <br> without getting anything in return . <br> You know who you are . I inadvertently became interested in tropical plants because that 's what the man at the Union Square Green Market sold me . <br> I used to believe that sentence , but now I know better . <br> Now I know that it was meant to be . <br> Here 's how it happened . <br> I had just moved to Fourteenth Street and Union Square , into a small , newly renovated studio with absolutely no character . It was a square-shaped box with parquet floors , no molding , no details , white paint , and low ceilings . It was exactly the kind of apartment I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the walls or the floorboards . No arguments or harrowing scenes of unrequited love staring at me from the bathroom mirror . It was brand-new . Just like I wanted my life to be . <br> I thought a bit of foliage might spruce the place up , no pun intended , and add some much-needed color , so I walked across the street to the Union Square Green Market to make my purchase . <br> The man at the plant stand was a throwback . He had streaky blond hair and a dirt-colored tan that came from being outside all the time . In his worn-out flannel shirt and beat-up Timberlands  --  worn for work , not fashion  --  he stood out in stark contrast to the manicured metro-sexuals perusing the market , wicker baskets in one hand , Gucci sunglasses in the other . This man was different . He was a rugged country-sexual . <br> He asked me to describe my apartment not in terms of the square footage or the make of the stove and the fridge , but by the amount of light , temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor-to-ceiling windows , which was mostly true , although they were more ceiling-to-heating-unit than ceiling-to-floor . I told him that I had an unobstructed south-facing view , hard to find in New York City , and that as long as the sun was shining it was hot and sunny all day long , even in the winter . <br> I had n't lived in my apartment through a winter , so I 'm not sure why I said that , but I guess it sounded good to me , and also to him , since he bent down amongst his plants , head covered with purple flowers , butt in the air , and emerged with a big smile and a two-foot-high bunch of leaves . <br> I was disappointed . <br> " What is it ? " <br> " A bird-of-paradise , " he said , holding it up toward the sky and twirling the pot around with his fingertips . <br> " A tropical plant ? " I asked , zipping my coat against the late-March wind and picturing its imminent death . <br> " Hawaiian , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . She needs lots of sunlight , not too direct , and let the soil dry out between waterings . She 's tough to raise , and she wo n't flower for five or six or maybe seven years , depending on the weather . And the love , " he added with a wink . <br> I unzipped my jacket . <br> Six or seven years ? My marriage did n't last that long . Do you have anything that flowers sooner , like in a week or two ? " <br> " This is the plant for you , " he said . " She 's a beauty . " <br> " How much ? " <br> " Thirty dollars , and I 'll throw in a brochure on rare tropicals so you know how to care for her . " <br> " Three zero I could go to the deli on the corner and get a dozen roses for ten dollars that have great big sweet-smelling flowers on them right now . " " You could , but they 'd be dead in a week . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do the math , I 'm a bargain . And besides , this bird is tropical . Think balmy ocean breezes , swaying palm trees , cabana boys , and pia coladas on white sand beaches near warm light-blue water . " <br> I do n't know whether it was the pia coladas , the cabana boys , or the sky blue of his eyes , but as a person who worked in advertising , I had to respect a good sales pitch . I paid him , and he handed me the plant , the brochure on rare tropicals , and his card , which said " David Exley , Plant Man . " <br> " Sounds like a superhero , " I said . <br> " Well , I do have a little something special with the flora and fauna , if you know what I mean . " I did n't , but I nodded anyway . <br> " Come back if her leaves start turning yellow around the edges . I 'm here every Monday , Wednesday , and Saturday from six in the morning till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said over my shoulder . " For thirty dollars they better stay bright freakin ' green . " <br> I walked through the market with my bird-of-paradise held out in front of me like an offering . It felt good to be carrying around a piece of the earth . I thought it made me look like one of those women who cooked satisfying meals on a nightly basis for their Steiner School children while wearing Birkenstocks and reading from the Cabala , instead of the single , childless , plantless , divorced thirty-two-year-old woman that I was . <br> Back in my apartment , I set the bird-of-paradise down on the window ledge . The base of the pot was too wide , and it teetered . I caught my thirty-dollar tropical right before it crashed to the floor . Not five minutes with me and its life was already in danger . No surprises there . The bird-of-paradise was the first living thing I shared space with since my divorce . No pets , no plants , no people , no problems had been my motto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-husband at work . He was cute and smart and successful and he was a huge mistake . He was a man who drank like a fish and wanted lots of babies . I was a woman who did n't want lots of babies and drank like a human being . I know that most marriages are complex and multilayered , but ours was not . Our four-year marriage went something like this : <br> Year one  --  " I love you , Lila . " <br> Year two  --  " I love you , Lila . " <br> Year three  --  " I love you , Lila . " <br> Year four  --  " I 'm leaving you , Lila , for the producer at the advertising agency . " <br> The producer at the advertising agency , aka the woman who brought him coffee and made his plane reservations . What a clichT . At the time I wondered how something that sounded so much like a made-for-TV movie could hurt so bad . <br> But in truth it was n't the drinking or the producer . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a big Irish Catholic family where everyone got married and had kids unless they were gay or terminally ill . I came from a family where no one ever got married unless they had kids first , and usually by accident . <br> My parents , whom I love madly , divorced when I was young . Post divorce , they both dated furiously , like teenagers , without ever remarrying . My sister and brother , both older , had children but no spouses . <br> A lot of people get married to keep with tradition . I was a rebel . I married to break with it . <br> The strange thing was , against all odds , I loved being married . I adored the little rituals . The cute nicknames . " Honeybear " for him . " Wild Rose " for me . I loved shopping at Whole Foods , cooking beef stews and chicken soups in huge pots with lots of vegetables . I loved washing the dishes while listening to Curtis Mayfield . I liked washing , drying , and folding the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuuming . I think it 's fair to say that during the years of my marriage I became the single most boring person in the entire world , and I totally loved it . <br> Turned out , my ex , who by all external appearances and family history was the solid , marrying kind , absolutely hated it . He was a space freak . He grew up in a tiny house with lots of siblings , and he could n't stand the proximity to another person . He kept dragging me around to buy bigger beds and move into larger spaces . In the end , we were sleeping on a mattress so wide we could lie spread-eagle and our fingertips ? would n't touch , and we were living in a loft the size of an airplane hangar . <br> Just to make sure I was n't crazy , I took a survey on the bed . My friend Oliver , who was a well-known interior designer , said it was the largest piece of furniture he 'd ever seen in a Manhattan apartment . My friend Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd crawled into her parents ' bed . My mother offered to have special sheets made for it . And my co-worker and good friend Kodiak Starr , who was a surfer , said that with its blue-green comforter it reminded him of the ocean . It was official . My bed was as big as the Atlantic . I was sleeping in New York , and my husband was all the way on the other side of the mattress , in London . <br> My big Honeybear , my rock , turned out to be a piece of pumice stone . Flaky and crumbly under pressure , and unable to talk about or even know what he was feeling . In our giant apartment with the giant bed , he moved farther and farther away , until one day he simply never came home at all . No kidding . Just like that . <br> Turned out my real rock was my co-worker Kodiak Starr . Kody was a bit of a philosopher/crunchy surfer for someone with such a glamorous name , and he was more beautiful than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " cool " and " dude , " and he was into things like transcendental meditation and lucid dreaming . He would probably be considered New Age if he had n't been born in 1984 , eight years after me . Because we shared an office , Kody did most of the day-to-day heavy lifting when it came to hearing about my ex . We were supposed to be working on a new commercial for Puma sneakers , but mostly we worked on the much more pressing questions of my marriage . When I asked him why my husband left without ever trying to work it out , he answered in lilting , rolling , easy-to-digest surfing metaphors . He brushed his silky blond hair behind his ears , put his flip-flop-clad feet up on the desk , and wrapped his hands around the back of his neck . <br> " Dude , " he said , " only world-class long-board surfers have the discipline to ride all kinds of waves , big or small , in all kinds of conditions . Your husband was a short-board amateur . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundredth time . " Why do I have to go through this ? " <br> " Because wiping out is like breathing , " he said . " Everybody does it . " <br> After the death of my marriage , I was hell-bent on keeping the bird-of-paradise alive . I would take it slowly . Plants first . And if everything went well , then I 'd move on to people . <br> In the mornings , before work , I stroked its stems with my fingertips , because they were slightly fuzzy and felt nice to the touch , and occasionally I washed its big ? banana- ? plant leaves with a damp sponge when they got too dusty from city living . <br> I treated that bird like a houseguest , except I gave it water instead of wine and I tried not to blow cigarette smoke in its direction . I kept the blinds open all day , even when it was so sunny I could n't read my computer screen . I catered to what I imagined to be its every whim , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew out of its stems . I coaxed them along with hand-wrung drops of water and sweet talk . They unfurled into giant shiny pale-green translucent leaves with delicate visible veins . <br> I wanted to go back to the green market to thank David Exley and brag about my progress ( aka see him again and flirt mercilessly ) , but I was afraid : when it came to men , I was skittish and out of practice . So instead I called Kody . <br> He answered his phone at the beach and screamed over the surf . " You got ta get back out there , Lila . You got ta get out there and catch some waves . Do n't come back till you have cramps in your calves from squatting in the curl . Free as a bird , girl . Free as a bird . " <br> I hung up the phone and headed to the green market , squatting in the curl . <br> " My bird is growing beautifully , " I said . <br> David Exley , Plant Man , pointed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more where that came from . " <br> " I 'm not shopping , I 'm just browsing . " " Fine by me , browse away . But if you have a minute I can take you into my tent and show you how to make that bird grow wings . " <br> " I have some time , " I said . " Show me how to make her fly . " <br> He dropped his voice and moved in closer . <br> " Before I give away the special secrets of my tropical trade , I need to know who I 'm talking to . " " I 'm Lila . " <br> " Lila , that 's nice . Lila what ? " <br> " Nova . " <br> " A middle name , Lila Nova ? " <br> " Grace . " <br> " Lila Grace Nova . The new Lila Grace . " <br> He took my elbow and led me into the indoor part of his plant stand . It was a humid , dripping green tent the size of a small city apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen degrees warmer than the air outside , and it smelled like damp earth and rain and things that are green . <br> On one wooden picnic table he had five tall birds-of-paradise . Their leaves were firm and pointing toward the sky . " Give me your hand , Lila Grace Nova . " He took my hand and ran my fingertips over a large leaf . <br> " Feel that ? " <br> " It 's wet . " <br> " Not wet . Misty . Can you feel the difference ? " <br> " How do you keep them like this ? <br> Misty , I mean . Without them turning into just plain wet ? " <br> He let go of my hand . It was covered with dirt from his gardening glove , as if he were still holding it . <br> " Buy yourself a couple of ? extra- ? large humidifiers . Do n't put ' em too close to the bird  --  you do n't want to soak the leaves  --  but not too far away , either  --  you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them coated with a fine , delicate mist . She 'll love it . She 'll grow you right out of your apartment . Take my word for it , you 'll have to move to a new place just to keep up with that bird . " <br> " I hate moving . " <br> " That 's because you 're rooted . The sign of a true plant person . " <br> I liked the sound of that . A true plant person . It sounded so much more alive , and warmer , and more female than a true advertising person . <br> I looked at Exley . His eyes were the color of a faded blue workshirt , with wrinkles spread out in a fan design around the outer corners , probably from squinting into the sun all day . He made me feel like I was n't in Manhattan , and I liked the feeling . This man is a true professional , I thought . A real flower- selling flirt . <br> " What kind of work do you do ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glamorous business , huh ? " <br> I gave it all I had . If he was going to play rugged country boy , I was going to play sexy city woman . <br> " Yes , " I said , brushing my wavy blond hair off my shoulders with both hands and shaking my head from side to side , " it 's a very glamorous business . " <br> Continues ...
