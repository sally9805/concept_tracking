If it seems as if Nicole Kidman has amped up her acting challenges in the past few years , it 's no accident .

" Rarely did a woman depart the dilettante lounge with as much resolve as she . Kidman 's postmarital roles have included a clinically depressed writer ( Virginia Woolf in The Hours for which she won an Oscar ) , an abused cleaning lady recovering from the death of her children ( The Human Stain ) , a woman barely getting by during the Civil War ( Cold Mountain ) and a fugitive victimized by nasty townspeople in the West ( Dogville ) .

Kidman is not the first star to play down her beauty for a role , but her bold choices have set a new bar for Hollywood actresses . And now as a producer ( In the Cut ) , she 's creating juicy roles for more of them . <P> She has helped redeem a country too . Sometimes , in a world shared with Rupert Murdoch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Australian  --  as if the country is full of curios and barbarians . Kidman is Australia 's best evidence of passion and sophistication , though she does n't see it . " Really ? " she says . " Oh , I 'd like to think I have a sliver of vulgarity.
