Our experts butt in to help America 's favorite families <p> WE KNOW THEM like we know our own families : The Sopranos mob , Malcolm in the Middle 's tribe , Raymond 's clan , even the Will &; Grace gang . And what with their erratic exercising , dodgy eating habits , and generally shaky emotions , we see them deal with some of the same issues we face ourselves , day after day . So Prevention asked our top advisors and editors  --  a veritable dream team of revered health experts  --  to advise America 's most popular TV families on how to live happier , more balanced lives . After all , there are years of reruns to stay healthy for . The Sopranos <p> America 's favorite Mob family <p> The Issue : Stress makes them do some not-so-healthy things . <p> <p> The Expert : Pam Peeke , MD , stress expert ; author , Fight Fat at Forty ; Pew Foundation Scholar in Nutrition and Metabolism ; and assistant clinical professor of medicine , University of Maryland School of Medicine <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a doctor and I care . Just do n't have me whacked for it . <p> Tony , what 's with the smoking , drinking , and stuffing your face 24/7 ? <p> Guys your age should know better . When your waist-to-hip ratio is greater than 0.8 ( trust me , yours is ) , you start to increase your risk of dropping dead from a heart attack or getting diabetes or cancer . With all of your money  --  I do n't want to know where it 's coming from  --  you should get a trainer to keep you in shape . <p> Meanwhile , you wonder why Carmela 's not interested ? That creepy T-shirt and boxer combo 's no turn-on , hon. And messing with the bimbos puts you at risk for sexually transmitted diseases . Imagine having to tell that to Carm . Marrone ! <p> Furthermore , you have nightmares about the guys you 've whacked , wake up hyperventilating , and walk around in a constant state of anxiety . I 'm afraid that the panic attacks will continue so long as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enjoy sunsets over the ocean when you know Big Pussy 's floating around out there somewhere . Stress kills , Tone . It ages you , it 's hell on the immune system , and it takes all the fun out of life . <p> Solution ? Get another line of work . This Mob thing 's killing you . <p> As for you , Carm , you do n't smile much . With your problems , who would ? Did you know that women who worry may have eight times the risk of heart disease as women who do n't ? That decreased appetite and stomach pain are stress related ? That toxic stress can screw up your menstrual cycles and your emotions ? <p> You need to turn it off , and get a pocket of peace here and there . Sit quietly , and just be . Let those anxious thoughts pass through you . Or learn how to meditate or try tai chi . Better yet , learn a martial art , and you get a win-win . You 'll relax at the same time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as payback for something nasty Tony pulled . <p> I say , dump the chump . Relocate , and get a life . Find a guy with a real job . And whatever you do , do n't give Tony my number . Malcolm in the Middle <p> Your average nuclear family , times two . Their five kids are 2.5 more than the national " average " limit . Lois and Hal work overtime to keep the bills paid and the kids from hurting themselves or others . <p> The Issue : Lois just had baby number five . And the boys need healthy outlets for all that energy . <p> <p> The Expert : Denise Austin , host of Denise Austin 's Fit and Lite and Denise Austin 's Daily Workout , and creator of more than 30 bestselling exercise videos . <p> <p> Lois with Jaime ( baby number five ) newly born , you need to get back in shape fast ; now you 'll really be needing all the strength and energy you can muster , but that gets harder as we age . Luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilates program will quickly help restore your figure and your energy . <p> Why Pilates ? Simple . Pilates helps condition the body without punishing it . These exercises will give you back your flat tummy , strengthen the muscles deep inside your abdomen , and help you develop the long , lean , toned muscles of a dancer . <p> I recommend three great Pilates moves  --  the crisscross , the frog , and the double-leg stretch  --  to focus on that lower stomach area that pregnancy stretches out of shape . Do these exercises at least five times weekly , and you can expect to see results in 3 to 6 weeks . ( Check them out at www.prevention.com/links or in my book , Pilates for Every Body ( Rodale Inc. , 2002 ) . <p> For little Jaime 's big brothers , I have a simple program to deliver what they really , really want : hot-looking pecs , 6-pack abs , and strong , well-developed legs . Here 's how to do it : <p> Pecs : Do two sets of 10 push-ups . For max pec-building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> Abs : Lie down on your back , your hands locked behind your head . Crank your legs in the air like you 're riding a bike , and lift your head and shoulders off the floor , twisting to the right to touch your left elbow to your right knee , then alternate . Do 20 cycles , rest briefly , then another 20 . <p> <p> Legs : NBA players use this when training to strengthen their legs and develop higher vertical jumps . It 's an alternating lunge move : Start with your left foot about 2 feet in front of your right . Bend your left knee , and lower your right knee to the floor . Now jump up , and switch legs , bringing your left knee to the floor . Do two sets of 10 reps . <p> <p> And Lois , here 's the really good news : If you can get the boys to faithfully do this routine five or so times a week , it 'll improve their moods and give them the strength to help out around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An old-fashioned suburban family , Raymond and Debra and their three kids live right across the street from the in-laws . <p> The issues : Grandma Marie meddles ; Grandpa Frank 's got anger management problems . There 's grown-up sibling rivalry between Raymond and Robert , and Raymond and Debra have trouble communicating . <p> <p> The Experts : Prevention 's editors , who know a little something about almost everything . <p> <p> Raymond , you need to get a tad more involved in doing the dad thing . Studies say that kids whose dads help with homework , take them on outings , and eat meals with them tend to do . better in school and have fewer behavioral problems . <p> As for you , Grandma Marie , all that running back and forth across the street takes energy , so if you want to keep it up , you 'd better get in shape : Carrying extra weight around the middle raises your risk for heart disease , the #1 killer of women . We strongly advise you to drop some weight and strengthen your bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , eventually picking up the pace to 15 . A 2- to 3-mile walk , taken four or five times a week , should help keep Marie meddling in her family 's affairs for many years to come . <p> As for all that meddling , we think it 's just your way of crying out for help . You 're really terrified that your family will stop needing you . Our advice ? Focus your energies on yourself , or better yet , on other people , preferably those not related to you . Put in some time as a volunteer  --  maybe in a soup kitchen or as a substitute granny for needy kids . And here 's a really great idea : Consider taking a weeklong silent retreat at a convent or monastery . The quiet introspection could literally change your life . At least everyone back at home would get a break . For a week . <p> Debra , we applaud your efforts to put more sizzle in your sex life , but we could do without your constant harping on Raymond . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch each other more . Holding hands , hugging , and other forms of nonverbal communication create intimacy , and that makes it harder to be mean to each other . Bonus : Good communication is a great aphrodisiac . Will &; Grace <p> The most atypical family in prime time . Members include gay Will , Grace , his straight female roomie , and their two dear friends : Jack , who has crushes on Liza and Cher , and Karen , who 's rich and neurotic . <p> The Issues : Staying cute and sane in an insane world <p> <p> The Expert : Douglas Schar , DipPhyt , MCPP , European-trained medical herbalist <p> <p> As an herbalist with a small life and a big TV , I often watch Will &; Grace and then contemplate how herbal medicine might aid this unusual American family . Make no mistake : If it were up to me , each and every one of them would be dosed with shrubbery on a daily basis . <p> Will , maintaining your slim waist is a priority . After all , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you lack enthusiasm for athletic pursuits . I think your workouts should be powered up with energy-boosting ginseng and cordyceps . Ginseng increases vitality and your ability to withstand stress ( or , in your ease , your ability to withstand Grace ) . It 's also thought to promote longevity and strengthen immunity . <p> I use cordyceps to power people up ; it 's a nearly instant energizer . Both herbs will get you off the kitchen stool and onto the treadmill . Added benefit : Both slow aging , and both can enhance libido . Though libido may not be one of your issues , I find that people do n't usually complain about having more of it . <p> Grace , you fume and fret yourself into a tizzy on a weekly basis . Such nervousness can make life hard for the neurotic and harder still on their friends . I recommend a combination of valerian and chamomile . <p> Both herbs have a long , safe history of use . Take a cup of chamomile tea with breakfast , lunch , and an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a day will also help soothe your nerves . <p> Poor Jack , your inability to make contact with planet Earth , and those dwelling upon it , may be due to poor circulation to the brain . I recommend ginkgo daily . <p> Ginkgo is a powerful antioxidant that helps prevent damage to the blood vessels serving the brain . Though opinion is mixed as to whether ginkgo can sharpen a healthy mind , the evidence suggests that it can . Use a brand standardized to 24% ginkgo flavone glycosides for at least 4 months before deciding if it 's working . <p> And finally , there 's Karen . Poor dear . You like to party hard and carry on until the wee hours . Though self-medicating with heavenknows-what probably keeps you from killing people , the pills and booze are converting your liver into something leathery . Toxic girl , you need regular dosing with milk thistle . <p> Milk thistle 's ability to protect the liver is well studied . In fact , it 's the only medicine in our arsenal that not only protects liver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can actually regenerate damaged cells . <p> I recommend milk thistle to anyone who drinks alcohol or is exposed to environmental contaminants . Choose a brand standardized to contain 140 mg of silymarin . <p> Cordyceps is available from Fungi Perfecti , www.prevention.com/links , or by calling ( 800 ) 780-9126 . Frasier <p> From the comfort of his duct-taped recliner , Marty Crane oversees the lives of his two sons , psychiatrists Frasier and Niles . <p> The Issue : A retired cop , Marty 's still recovering from an on-the-job injury as he edges into his seventies . <p> <p> The Expert : Geriatrician Mark Lachs , MD , MPH , director of geriatrics for the New York Presbyterian Health System , and Beeson Physician Faculty Scholar with the American Federation for Aging Research <p> You mostly see seniors on TV depicted as feeble , frail , sexless , or just plain undesirable . Television  --  and the rest of pop culture  --  mirrors the biases our society has against aging : Many older people set low expectations for having a productive life after digesting these portrayals . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging in prime time . Despite chronic pain , you live well . You 've got mobility problems , use a cane , and even need a live-in home health attendant . But you also date lovely women , dispelling the myth of no sex after 60 , You 've got a strong family , bar buddies , and a pet who gives you great joy . Best of all , you also command one of the most powerful weapons against illness and disability I know of : humor . You laugh and make other people laugh . A far cry from Grampa Simpson indeed ! <p> How to be like Marty : Deal with our disabilities head on . If you need support , get it . If physical therapy or an exercise program is right for you , follow through on all recommendations . <p> And get yourself a pet like Eddie , the feisty terrier . There 's plenty of scientific evidence that suggests that owning a pet , or even being around them , as in pet therapy visits , is a mood and health booster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  son A.J. , Tony , and Carmela <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Tony , with that paunch , fuhgeddaboud Silvio 's sub <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Carmela , honey . you do n't smile much <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lois , listen to yourself <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Malcolm , Reese , Dewey , and Jaimie . more surprises for Hal and Lois ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Raymond 's favorite room ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Robert , Frank , Marie , Raymond , and Debra . say something nice for once <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Grace and Will : Try this herb <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Karen , dear , try doing something nice for your liver <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Eddie and Marty  --  a healthy TV relationship <p> Produced by Sara Altshul , alternative medicine editor ; Shelley Drozd , assistant fitness editor and Jenny Proust , editorial assistant <p>                    @
