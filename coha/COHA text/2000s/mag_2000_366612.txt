As the tragic police stories continue to unfold in New York City and Los Angeles , I 'm reminded of the opening lines of A Tale of Two Cities : " It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . " In both cities , after decades of steady increases , crime rates have fallen dramatically  --  due , in no small measure , to the efforts of the police . Yet at a time when they might expect to be glorified for that success , they find themselves vilified for some of the tactics and strategies used to achieve it . <P> The corrupt and brutal behavior that seems to have played a major role in the crime-reduction efforts of the Rampart division of the Los Angeles Police Department deserves to be vilified , whereas in New York City the four police officers acquitted in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo made a tragic mistake  --  one that not only took a man 's life but also shook the trust and confidence of the minority community in the police department itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissimilar incidents is that under no circumstances can police be encouraged  --  by politicians or police leaders or acquiescence from the community  --  to tolerate lowering of constitutional guidelines in order to reduce crime . Legal rules such as the Miranda guidelines are intended to curb police excesses . But those guidelines seem to disappear in the heat of an adrenaline rush and fear . Only constant supervision and training can prevent abuses and mistakes . <P> The glorification of the type of policing practiced by Detective Sipowicz on NYPD Blue , where the end always justifies the means , can not be tolerated . This role model must be changed . Policing is not entertainment . It is real . It is complex . It can be a matter of life or death . <P> In the mid-1990s , police were in their glory days , as they saw that their work was winning the war on crime . Phrases like " we own the night , " the mantra of the New York Street Crime Unit , were meaningful to the good officers committed to taking back the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns were removed from predators , the slogan and the tactics should have changed . Criminals were not the only ones in fear of aggressive policing ; so were many law-abiding citizens , particularly in the minority community , with whom the safety of the night should have been shared . Worse , in Los Angeles those corrupt officers believed they not only owned the night but owned everyone and everything in the name of that same war on crime . <P> Both the police and the community should be enjoying the dividend of more peaceful times in our cities . However , racial tension and community mistrust of the police abounds . The true tragedy of the New York City and Los Angeles events is that as crime rates fell , confidence in the police in the minority community fell with them . The police had an unprecedented opportunity to be at the front lines of healing the racial divide . Instead the police remain the flash point for racial tension .                   @ @
