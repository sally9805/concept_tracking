Peering deep into space , the doomed Hubble Space Telescope sees the dawn of creation . // THE Hubble Space Telescope has looked deep into the osmic abyss and created a unique baby picture of the universe . fntil now , images returned by Hubble showed galaxies as they ppeared when they were cosmic youngsters . The new images reveal the galaxies as toddlers , in the midst of a period of rapid developmental changes . As with many baby pictures , the celestial portrait of the young universe was anything but easy to create , and it came into being 14 years after the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) flew into orbit . Launched in 1990 with a faulty mirror , the telescope became NASA 's biggest embarrassment and even the butt of jokes on late-night TV . Then , in 1993 , a team of shuttle astronauts flew to Hubble to make repairs , quickly turning it into the agency 's crown jewel . Since 1997 , three shuttle crews have flown to the telescope to carry out maintenance work and to upgrade and replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a combination of images taken by two sophisticated cameras . The devices were installed by shuttle astronauts in 2002 : One captures visible light , and the other infrared . The picture is also significant because it maybe one of the last images of its type created in this decade . In the wake of the Columbia disaster , HST may never get another visit by astronauts . That is if NASA stands by its pledge of sending no more shuttle crews to the telescope . Launching the shuttle to rendezvous with Hubble would mean sending astronauts onto an orbit far too distant from the International Space Station-considered the only possible safe haven in case of emergency . TIME MACHINE The two Hubble instruments picked up the faint light from galaxies about 13 billion light-years away . That is much farther into space than groundbased telescopes and even HST 's previous instruments could see . By capturing light emitted by stars so long ago , the telescope , in effect , is looking back in history much like a time machine would . In fact , it is almost staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within a stone 's throw of the big bang itself , " says Massimo Stiavelli , a scientist at NASA 's Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md . So far , the number of galaxies spotted in Hubble 's so-called Ultra-Deep Field amounts to 10,000 . These star groups are poorly organized , though , and only some of them resemble the graceful forms of galaxies such as Andromeda , which is noted for its spiral arms . The universe began with the big bang . For the next 300 million years radiation was so intense , light itself could not penetrate . Slowly , subatomic particles turned into atoms and then condensed into stars , which eventually congregated . Within a billion years they had turned into galaxies-a rather quick evolution , in cosmological terms , scientists say . A few of the oldest galaxies photographed by Hubble have strange shapes : Some look like thin sticks while others could be classified as plain old cosmic oddballs . A key question , astronomers say , is whether the universe looked the same at the age of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1 billion and 2 billion years old . In short , the question is this : When did the universe start to tidy up and take the form we see today ? LONG SHOT The historic images Hubble gathered were taken during 400 Earth orbits from September 2003 to January 2004 . During this time the telescope was pointed at the same location in space for a total exposure time of about 1 million seconds . The area populated by the UltraDeep Field 's 10,000 galaxies is below the constellation Orion . At first glance the field appears almost empty . If observed from the ground , scientists say , the apparent size is equivalent to one-tenth that of the full moon . NASA astronomers have compared this to looking at the sky through an 8-ft. - long soda straw . It will take years to determine how far into the depths of the universe the Hubble can see , but apparently one camera caught sight of galaxies that existed 400 million years after the big bang . Additional research will be needed to confirm the discovery . PEERING DEEPER Examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to identify about 1000 objects , says Sangeeta Malhotra , one of the principal investigators at the Space Telescope Science Institute . " Included among them are some of the intensely faint and red points of light in the image-prime candidates for distant galaxies , " Malhotra says . " Some of these objects are among the farthest and youngest galaxies ever seen . The spectra also distinguish among other types of very red objects , such as old and dusty red galaxies , quasars and cool dwarf stars . " One of the two new cameras , the Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys , makes it possible for astronomers to see galaxies two to four times fainter than Hubble could see with its previous cameras . Called ACS for short , the instrument can.detect radiation below visible light frequencies , which enables astronomers to spot some of the most remote galaxies in the universe . It is likely that this baby picture may hold the record as the deepestever view of the universe until NASA launches HSTs successor in 2011 : the James Webb Space Telescope ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scan the universe exclusively using infrared instruments . Like automobile foglights , they will penetrate through the haze of interstellar and intergalactic dust that limits visibility , thus giving the next generation of astronomers a look back in time to the era of galaxy formation and beyond . Using the Webb 's 21-ft. - wide mirror , astronomers may see the birth of stars and planetary systems similar to our own . Moreover , scientists hope to shed light on the so-called dark matter question and begin to understand the nature of this invisible material that pervades the universe . JWST is scheduled to launch in August 2011 aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket , which will place it on an orbit far too high to be serviced by the space shuttle . In retrospect , this was a fortunate choice , as President George W. Bush 's newvision for space exploration requires the shuttle fleet be grounded by 2010 .
