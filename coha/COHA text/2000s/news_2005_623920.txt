<p> When Mini USA selected Sausalito advertising agency Butler , Shine , Stern &; Partners to handle its $25 million Mini Cooper account earlier this month , it was n't just because it wanted a campaign of quirky ads for a cute car . <p> They 'll certainly get that . But Butler , Shine 's larger task is developing the Mini Cooper brand . <p> The peppy little British car made its U.S. premiere in 2002 with advertising that suggested Mini buyers would be " motoring , " not " driving . " <p> Those ads were the work of Miami ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky , a young shop known for its creative work . But in September , Crispin Porter resigned the Mini USA account after winning Volkswagen 's $400 million North American account  --  more than 10 times Mini 's billings . <p> Although Mini 's media budget pales compared with ad spending by the major auto manufacturers , the company 's search for a new agency drew a lot of attention in the industry . <p> Crispin Porter had placed the creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini account  --  Mother , a British firm , and Strawberry Frog , a Dutch agency , both with New York offices  --  were , like Butler , Shine , independent agencies known for nontraditional work . <p> Mini USA executives recently brought representatives of the three agencies to the New York area for an intense weekend of meetings . The executives also visited the agencies to get a sense of their chemistry , said Trudy Hardy , the Mini USA marketing manager in Woodcliff Lake , N.J. <p> Butler , Shine 's proposal " showed a great sense of community , and the Mini is a very community-oriented brand , " she said . <p> The agency 's task is to help move Mini Cooper , which is owned by BMW , into its growth stage . U.S. sales have gone from 24,590 in 2002 to 38,384 in the first 11 months of 2005 , twice what had been projected , according to Hardy . <p> The Butler , Shine Mini Cooper campaign will start in the spring . Butler , Shine Chief Executive Officer Greg Stern wo n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formats , including print , television , outdoor and Internet . <p> " It is basically about the evangelical community of owners ( of Minis ) and creating technological platforms that recognize those owners and allows them to do what they do  --  which is be evangelical about the brand , " Stern said . He said the agency 's pitch to the company was titled " Evolving the Mini brand without screwing it up . " <p> Industry pros say landing the account is a feather in the cap for Bay Area agencies , which have suffered since the dot-com bust . <p> " It sure is n't shabby to have a local shop taking over an assignment from what is arguably the hottest agency in the nation , " said Jef Loeb , a principal at Brainchild Creative in San Francisco . <p> Key acquisitions <p> Butler , Shine weathered the lean years by shrinking its staff  --  it laid off eight employees at the end of 2001  --  and using revenue it had socked away to reorganize and make key acquisitions . <p> It bought S.F. Interactive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting division , InFlux , which was one of the early commercial developers of a blog . And it established a design division , Gargantua , which creates packaging , Web sites and other brand identity materials . <p> " What the strategy has been for the past three , four years , is to create a variety of doors through which clients might enter , " said Stern . That " differentiated us from all the other startups out there . " <p> All Butler , Shine 's divisions operate under one roof in the historic waterfront Marinship district of Sausalito , where World War II Liberty Ships were manufactured . The agency is expanding again . It has 88 employees and needs eight more . <p> " It turns out they are actually terrific businesspeople as well as good creative guys , " said Jeff Goodby , the co-founder of Goodby , Silverstein &; Partners ad agency in San Francisco . " They did n't just win ( the Mini account ) . They realigned their agency in order to make it ready to win , even before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners  --  CEO Stern , 45 , and creative directors Mike Shine , 42 , and John Butler , 45  --  worked for Goodby . <p> Goodby said that Shine and Butler told him when they interviewed for jobs in 1991 that they wanted to start an agency . If they were hired , they told him , they would leave after a year or two  --  " as soon as they could work up their nerve . " <p> They made their move in June 1993 , working briefly out of Butler 's kitchen . After only two weeks , they snagged a plum client , Italy 's Barilla Pasta , Europe 's largest advertiser . <p> They filmed commercials in Milan with tennis great Steffi Graf making pasta . In one of the spots , Graf , unable to find a strainer , pours a pot of pasta into her tennis racquet propped over a sink . It was shown all over Europe . <p> While fishing on San Francisco Bay on Halloween 1993 , Butler and Shine talked Stern into joining the agency . <p> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We catch a barracuda , a salmon , they show me some phony numbers about how much they are making freelancing . I say OK , I 'll cast my fate with these guys . " <p> Each of the three tossed in $8,000 to buy computers and a copy machine and pay the rent for space in the same building they 're in today . <p> Within a year , the agency , now named Butler , Shine and Stern , was working for Disney , Microsoft , 20th Century Fox and Noah 's Bagels . <p> From 1994 to 1996 , the agency was on retainer to Anheuser-Busch , focused on developing new products , such as Pacific Ridge Pale Ale , Rio Cristal and Spyke Beer . That account gave the agency a huge boost in the pre-dot-com years , Butler said . <p> As it grew , Butler , Shine took on some large , stable clients , including Borders Books , Round Table Pizza , Charles Schwab and Anchor Blue , the owner of the Millers Outposts teen clothing stores . <p> When the Internet came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dot-com clients : Allbusiness.com , E-Stamp , HomeWarehouse.com , Family Wonder , Garage Band , iFuse , MetaMarkets . <p> " We saw all the road shows " of startups seeking agencies , said Butler . " At the end of it , we pretty much knew by sitting in a meeting , within five minutes , whether or not that company was going to make any money . " <p> Home video campaign <p> In August 2004 , the agency produced advertising using consumer-generated content for Converse shoes . <p> People were invited to make their own 24-second home videos about anything , inspired by the Converse brand , some of which were incorporated into commercials . These tiny films , with six-second tag lines and images of Converse shoes at the end , can still be seen at www.conversegallery.com . <p> " We were particularly impressed by the work that ( Butler , Shine ) had done for Converse , " said Mini USA 's Hardy . " Asking customers to submit their own films for potential use in advertising really invited them into the brand . Our customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past three years , the agency has gone from working primarily for regional , local and niche clients to major national and international companies . <p> In addition to Mini USA , Butler , Shine 's other major accounts include Converse , Lucas Arts , Diageo wines and online work for Sprite . In February , the agency won the Sun Microsystems account . <p> Giant ad corporations have made acquisition overtures . Butler , Shine and Stern listened to all of them . <p> " We would sit around this table and ask each other , ' The day after that check is cut and cashed , do you still want to work for this company ? ' " Butler said . " The answer was always no . " <p> Butler , Shine has resisted the temptation of big money because the principals are passionate about the culture they have created . <p> " We went back to why we did this in the first place , " Butler explained . " We loved the autonomy . We wanted to be masters of our own little universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Greg Stern are ready to go to work on their new account , Mini USA , designing ads for Mini Coopers . / Kurt Rogers / The Chronicle , ( 2 ) The popular Mini Cooper will be the focus of a new ad campaign to be designed by Butler , Shine , Stern &; Partners . / Brant Ward / The Chronicle 2002 , ( 3 ) Previous campaigns from the agency include home videos by customers for Converse , left , and print ads for Sun Microsystems . / Butler , Shine , Stern &; Partners
