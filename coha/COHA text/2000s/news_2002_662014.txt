<p> He was once a radio church reviewer in Pittsburgh , offering on-air critiques of houses of worship - their music , their architecture , even their pastors ' sermons . <p> Before that , he started a ruckus over unsafe sex at South Carolina highway rest areas . He wanted the state to install condom machines . <p> Now the Rev. George Exoo , who leads two Unitarian-Universalist congregations in West Virginia , is making news for being present when a 49-year-old woman took her own life in an apartment in Ireland . <p> Exoo said Rosemary Toole Gilhooley 's Jan. 26 death in Dublin was one of more than 100 he 's been involved with since 1995 . It 's part of his work with a group he founded and calls Compassionate Chaplaincy . <p> Ireland 's national police force is investigating Exoo , who sat at Gilhooley 's side as she took sleep-inducing drugs , smoked a last cigarette and then pulled a helium-filled bag over her head . <p> The investigation , which began when Gilhooley 's father took her suicide note to police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not illegal in the United States to sit with people as they kill themselves as long as they procured and administered their own means of death , according to the Hemlock Society , the nation 's oldest and largest right-to-die group . The American Bar Association 's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly agrees . <p> Exoo said he does nothing more than sit by a person 's side and give comfort . He acknowledged , however , that if he held a person 's hand - as he said he did Gilhooley 's - while reading a Psalm aloud , it would be more difficult for that person to pull a bag off her head . <p> Exoo was drawn into the right-to-die movement through the 1983 illness and death of a member of his former congregation in Charleston , S.C . That man 's wife later persuaded him to join the Hemlock Society . <p> Exoo said he does not seek publicity and he 's " not interested in being a Jack Kevorkian " - the retired pathologist whose public crusade for physician-assisted suicide ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His efforts have put him at odds with the Hemlock Society and his own church 's governing association . <p> The Hemlock Society referred some people to Exoo until a year ago , but now does not want him using its name and considers Exoo " a lone ranger , " said Ryan Ross , a society spokesman , who added he knew of no other minister who is regularly present at suicides . <p> " He does what George Exoo thinks is right . We have our standards and policies and they are not in sync , " Ross said . The Hemlock Society , for example , requires clients to prove they are mentally sound and have a terminal illness or irreversible disability . <p> Exoo , who has no medical or psychological training , says that before he counsels people planning suicide , he must be convinced they are suffering from an incurable illness or disability . <p> " Many times we do get the medical records . ... I do n't always insist on it because most of the time , I tell you , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are terminally ill and it 's pretty obvious that they are : They 're crippled , they 're at an end stage , " he told RTE , the Irish national broadcasting service . <p> Exoo has said Gilhooley convinced him she had an incurable brain dysfunction . Irish newspapers have reported she suffered only from depression . <p> The Unitarian Universalist Association since 1998 has supported a terminally ill person 's right to commit suicide . The association parted ways with Exoo in November , though he can still serve his congregations in Beckley and Lewisburg . <p> Association spokesman John Hurley would not discuss Exoo 's situation . <p> Exoo explained , " They did not like the design of Compassionate Chaplaincy and I was not pleased with what they wanted me to do . " For example , he said , the association wanted him to have a doctor on the Compassionate Chaplaincy board . <p> Some advocates for the disabled also criticize Exoo 's work . <p> " We see it not as compassion , but as contempt for our lives , " said Diane Coleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is president of the advocacy group Not Dead Yet in Forest Park , Ill . <p> " Why is suicide a bad thing for everybody else except us ? " Coleman said . <p> Exoo , 59 , was born and raised a Methodist in suburban Cleveland . After graduating from Boston 's Emerson College in 1964 , he earned a graduate degree from Harvard Divinity School and studied toward his doctoral degree in music history at the University of California-Berkeley . <p> He taught sociology at several colleges until he was ordained into the Unitarian-Universalist ministry in 1973 . He led congregations in Charleston and Myrtle Beach , S.C. , among others , and has led the new River Fellowship in Beckley part-time since 1997 . He also gathered a congregation in Lewisburg . <p> His work as an AIDS activist in Charleston drew fire and in part led to his resignation from the church he served for 10 years . <p> " George is a person whose heart is in the right place , frequently . His judgment on political matters is subject to question , " said Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1987 was in charge of the Charleston church committee that persuaded Exoo to resign . <p> The church supported Exoo 's AIDS advocacy , Robinson said , but it backfired and alienated supporters because of " the way he went about it . " <p> Exoo got a grant to study how Interstate 26 rest areas were used for homosexual sex and publicized his findings , hoping it would lead to a safe-sex initiative . He should have anticipated the police crackdown that followed instead , Robinson said . <p> From South Carolina , Exoo went to West Virginia to help establish a hospice house at a Hare Krishna community . There he met Thomas McGurrin , a Krishna monk , and the two have been companions ever since . <p> They moved to Pittsburgh , where Exoo supported himself caring for a disabled man and being the " The Church Man " on WQED-FM , reviewing churches , synagogues , mosques and meetinghouses . <p> Of one minister , he told listeners : " He promised to cast his sermon in four points , but ended up after 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . Two and three were unrelated . " <p> While in Pittsburgh , Exoo said , he assisted in his first suicide in 1995 . George Koss , who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or Lou Gehrig 's disease , and his wife , Josephine , contacted Exoo through the Hemlock Society . <p> After George Koss ' death , Exoo and Josephine Koss formed Compassionate Chaplaincy , which he said helps those whom the Hemlock Society and other groups turn away . <p> Exoo and McGurrin said they have counseled and helped many people who do n't kill themselves , buying medication for some and taking others to doctors . <p> One such person , a woman who has put off her plan to commit suicide since befriending Exoo , said , " He has never pushed anybody into anything they do n't want . " She spoke on condition she not be identified . <p> Compassionate Chaplaincy consists of Exoo ; McGurrin ; a woman in the medical field but not a physician ; and three other right-to-die advocates . <p> Exoo gets support for his assisted suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a city of about 17,000 in southern West Virginia 's coalfields . <p> " I feel he is performing a very necessary ... service for people , " said church member Ed Brown . <p> " He 's one of the most compassionate , selfless people we 've ever known , " said another , Beverly Kinraide . <p> His main source of income is the $375 a month he receives from the Beckley congregation . He asks for money from those who seek his help with suicide . <p> While Exoo told RTE that he hopes the " fuss " in Ireland over his actions results in a discussion of the need for legal assisted suicide , a leading psychiatrist there , Dr. Patricia Casey , said that is not likely . <p> " It is absolutely vital that assisted suicide be regarded as a criminal act , " she said . <p> Casey , professor of psychiatry at University College Dublin , said it is legally and professionally and morally wrong for people in authority to counsel clinically depressed people to die . <p> Exoo said he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go as long as I can go ; as long as God gives me the strength to do it , I 'll do it . " <p> But , he said , " I 'll never go back to Ireland . " <p> End Adv <p>
