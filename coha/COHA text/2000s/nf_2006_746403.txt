This study examines various motives for participating in the sport of cycling . Past research on the sport of cycling has mostly been limited to physiological studies of elite cyclists . However , past research on marathon runners and triathletes reveals a long list of possible motives for participation . A total of 1,239 male and female cyclists completed a modified version of the Motivations of Marath oners Scales ( MOMS ) that measured psychological motives , physical motives , social motives , and achievement motives . As a group , cyclists endorsed goal achievement and health concerns as reasons for cycling . Male cyclists were more likely to endorse competition than female cyclists and females were more likely to endorse weight concern , affiliation , and self- esteem as reasons for cycling . Competitive cyclists were more likely than non-competitive cyclists to endorse goal achievement , competition and recognition as reasons for cycling . Non-competitive cyclists were more likely to endorse weight concerns and affiliation as motives . Road cyclists were more likely to endorse goal achievement and competition while mountain bikers endorsed life meaning as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and training in the sport of cycling are discussed . <p> Cycling in the United States is in the middle of a revival . This can partly in the sport of cycling . Greg LeMond became the first American to win the Tour de France in 1986 and again in 1989 and 1990 . Over a decade later , Lance Armstrong became the second American to win in 1999 . After overcoming life-treating cancer , he repeated as Tour champion in 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 to tie the race record for most wins . In 2005 , cycling fans from around the world marveled as Lance Armstrong shattered the competition on his way to a record - breaking seventh Tour De France title and elevating cycling 's appeal in the United States to unprecedented levels . <p> Examining the reasons why individuals participate in the sport of cycling is both timely and important . Like running a marathon , participation in the sport of cycling , does not simply consist of arriving at the starting line at a designated time and then having to suffer hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ogles &; Jolton , 1993 ) . Rather , participating in an endurance event is the result of months of daily training ( Croft , Gray &; Duncan , 1999 ) . As such , Masters et al . ( 1993 ) found that these athletes sometimes must alter their lives in the form of work responsibilities , time spent away from family , eating behaviors and so on . With this in mind , it makes sense that the principle applies to cyclists , who also take their sport very seriously ( Croft , Gray &; Duncan , 1999 ) . <p> Past research on the sport of cycling has mostly been limited to physiological studies of elite cyclists , strength and power output measures , and the efficacy of various training regimes . To date , there are few empirical studies examining the psychological aspects of cycling . However , past research on marathon runners and triathletes reveals a long list of possible motives for participation . For example , Clough , Sheperd , and Maughan ( 1989 ) found multiple reasons for participation including well being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among marathon runners . The reasons why individuals are motivated to participate in such activities are thought to be influenced by several factors including gender , age , activity level , and type of activity ( Koivula , 1999 ; Ogles &; Masters , 2000 ) . <p> Understanding the various motives for participating in cycling events may play an important role in developing and increasing adherence to training programs , promoting cycling- related events , and increasing physical activity among adults . Previous research suggests athletes are not motivated by the same factors . Masters et al . ( 1993 ) suggests that runners may be characterized by different motives for participation . For example , some are motivated by a need to compete against other participants , whereas others are driven to improve their own performance ( i.e. , goal orientation ) ( Masters , Ogles &; Jolton , 1993 ) . Additionally , Gat and McWhirter ( 1998 ) found that competitive cyclists were less cooperative than recreational cyclists . Performance and competition goals are obvious reasons for participating in competitive sports . However , health concerns may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more important for non-competitive athletes . <p> Previous research on competitive and non-competitive athletes indicates that motives differ by gender . For example , King and Burke ( 2000 ) found that females were shown to rate the categories of weight concern , affiliation with other runners , psychological coping , life meaning and feelings of self-esteem above that of males ( King &; Burke , 2000 ) . Similarly , Masters et al . ( 1993 ) found that female marathon runners were more likely to endorse weight concerns and affiliation than males as primary reasons for participation . In a study of older adults , Kolt , Driver , and Giles ( 2004 ) found that women rated social affiliation , involvement , and health reasons more than men for participating in a wide variety of physical activities including swimming , tennis , and walking . <p> Motives for participating in cycling may also differ by activity level and type of activity ( i.e. road cycling vs. mountain bike riding- MTB ) . Research on competitive versus noncompetitive marathon runners reveals that competitive runners endorsed goal achievement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - competitive runners reported weight concern and affiliation as motives for participation ( Ogles &; Masters , 2003 ) . Elite triathletes reported that health and weight concern are primary factors in their participation in races and training while non- elite triathletes endorsed life meaning as the main reason for participation ( Croft , Gray &; Duncan , 1999 ) . <p> With the recent increase in cycling 's popularity and the amount of time and money devoted to the sport , it is both timely and important to understand why individuals participate in the sport of cycling . Previous research on motives of other endurance athletes indicates that the reasons for participation may vary by gender , level of participation and type of activity . The purpose of this study was to uncover the motives for cycling . In particular , this study examines differences in motivates for cycling by gender , activity level ( competitive vs. noncompetitive vs. leisure ) , and type of cycling activity ( road vs . MTB ) . Method Participants <p> The participants were male ( n=944 ) and female ( n=295 ) adult cyclists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in a secure Internet-based survey through announcements on bicycling - related websites , Internet chat rooms , and advertisements on State and local governing - body websites . The use of Internet-based surveys has been shown to be a reliable and valid medium for collecting health related data ( Kypri , Gallagher , &; CashellSmith , 2004 ) . Participants were told of the nature of the study , time commitment , and confidentiality of their responses . Consent to participate in this study was obtained by having participants check a box that indicated their consent . Participants were provided an incentive to participate in the study by means of a raffle for a $25.00 gift certificate to a bicycling retailer . The Institutional Review Board at California State University , San Bernardino reviewed and approved this study . Measures <p> Participants completed a modified version of the Motivations of Marathoners Scales ( MOMS ) ( Masters , Ogles , &; Jolton , 1993 ) . The word " running " or derivations thereof were replaced with " cycling " or " cyclists " . The MOMS instrument is a 56-item instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives ( self-esteem , psychological coping , life meaning ) , physical motives ( health orientation , weight concern ) , social motives ( affiliation , social recognition ) , and achievement motives ( competition , personal goal achievement ) . Scales are rated from a score of 1 ( not a reason ) to 7 ( a very important reason ) . Subscale scores are obtained by calculating each item in each of the nine subscales . No items are reversed scored . The nine scales of the MOMS demonstrated adequate reliability ( internal consistency .81 to .92 ) . In addition , evidence for factorial validity of the MOMS instrument has been demonstrated ( Masters , Ogles , &; Jolton , 1993 ) . <p> Additionally , participants completed a brief demographics section and questions regarding the type of cycling they do ( road , mountain biking ) , activity level , competition level , and experience level . For the purpose of this study , activity level was operationally defined using 3 levels : competitive , non-competitive , and leisure . Competitive cyclists were those who self- identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had competed in a competition race ( sanctioned by USA Cycling or other governing body ) in the last 3 months . Non-competitive cyclists were defined as individuals who cycle on their own or with others in organized bicycle rides ( century events , etc ) but who had not competed and were not participating in organized cycling competitions at the time of this study . Leisure cyclists were those who identified themselves as leisure or casual cyclists and reported that they had not participated in any organized cycling event in the last 6 months . Additionally , participants were asked the average number of days and miles they typically ride during the week . Results Demographics <p> A total of 1,239 cyclists ( mean age= 37.20 ) participated in this study . Of these participants , 88% reported that they were primarily road cyclists and 12% reported that they were primarily mountain bike cyclists ( MTB ) . Table 1 shows the gender , level of activity , and type of cyclists of the sample . Fifty- five percent of the respondents were competitive cyclists , 35% were non - competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During an average week , male cyclists rode an average of 5 days per week , while female cyclists rode an average of 4 days per week . Male cyclist reported that they rode 165 miles during an average week , while female cyclists averaged 118 miles per week . Sixty- five percent of the sample reported being a member of a cycling club , 93% of the competitive cyclists report being a member of a sponsored cycling team , and 44% of the sample reported membership in USA cycling . <p> Overall , goal achievement , health concern , and weight concern were ranked as the main reasons why individuals participate in the sport of cycling . Table 2 shows the ranked means and standard deviations for each variable of interest of all cyclists in the sample . Gender Differences <p> A multivariate ANOVA was performed to determine any significant differences between gender , activity level ( competitive , non-competitive , leisure ) and motives for cycling . A significant main for gender was found F ( 9,946 ) = 6.05 , p = .001 . A significant main effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17.32 , p = .001 . However , the gender by activity level interaction was found to be non-significant . Scheffe 's post hoc tests revealed that male cyclists were significantly more likely than female cyclists to endorse Competition as a reason for involvement in cycling t(1060) = 5.67 , p = .001 , r = . 17 . Females were significantly more likely than males to endorse Weight Concern t(1072) = 2.32 , p = .02 , r = .07 , Affiliation t(1084) = 6.97 , p = .001 , r=. 21 , and Self- Esteem t(1045) = 3.24 , p = . 001 , r= .10 as reasons for cycling ( see Table 2 ) . Activity Level <p> A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine any significant differences between activity level ( competitive , non-competitive , leisure ) and motives for cycling . A significant main effect for activity level was found F(18,1812)= 14.01 , p = .001 . Scheffe 's post hoc tests revealed that competitive cyclists were significantly more likely than non-competitive cyclists to endorse goal achievement ( p &lt; .01 ) , competition ( p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as reasons for cycling . Non-competitive cyclists were more likely than competitive cyclists to endorse weight concerns ( p &lt; .01 ) , and affiliation ( p &lt; .01 ) as reasons for cycling ( see Table 3 ) . No significant differences were found between non-competitive and leisure cyclists . Furthermore , no significant differences were found among the three groups for coping , life meaning and self- esteem . Road vs . MTB <p> A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine any significant differences between type of cyclists ( road vs . MTB ) and motives for cycling . Weighted means for each group ( road , MTB ) were used due to the uneven sample size . Road cyclists were far more likely than MTB to endorse goal achievement F ( 1,1104 ) = 13.16 , p &lt; .001 , r= .15 and competition F ( 1,1128 ) = 12.02 , p &lt; .01 , r= .14 than their mountain-biking counterparts . Mountain bikers were significantly more likely than road cyclists to endorse life meaning F ( 1,1104 ) = 7.54 , p &lt; .05 , r=. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . No significant differences were found between road cyclists and mountain bikers for self- esteem , coping , and affiliation . Discussion <p> This study contributes to the existing literature regarding motives for competitive and non-competitive adult athletes . The recent success of professional American cyclists and the increase in the number of individuals participating in cycling makes this area of study timely . This study shows that female cyclists are more likely to participate in cycling because of weight concerns , affiliation , and self- esteem . There are several possible explanations for these findings . First , it may be that females are less likely to endorse competition and goal achievement because there are fewer opportunities for competitive amateur female cyclists to compete . Furthermore , when compared to men , there is also stronger pressure on female athletes to have a youthful appearance and to be slim ( Koivula , 1999 ; Willis &; Campbell , 1992 ) . Nonetheless , characterizing female participation in cycling based on this study must be made cautiously . Assertions that women are more likely to be motivated to participate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly simplistic ( Masters &; Ogles , 2003 ) . <p> The finding that competitive cyclists endorsed personal goal achievement and recognition more than non-competitive cyclists is not interesting unless one understands the nature of competitive cycling . Competitive road cycling is both an individual and team sport . Competitive cyclists often compete on sponsored teams , working together to assist one cyclist to the finish line . Team tactics such as drafting , attacking , and blocking are used by members of the team who sacrifice their chances of winning to assist the team 's leader in crossing the finish line first . Nonetheless , the team 's leader must have the strength , endurance , and skill to be able to capitalize on the team 's effort . Therefore , one would assume that motives based on affiliation and social recognition would be important to cyclists who compete at a high level , but sacrifice their own goals for that of the team 's . This dynamic is perhaps unique to competitive cycling and deserves further study . <p> Consequently , future research should examine the hierarchical nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 ) points out , individuals may participate in sports for a variety of reasons arranged in an order of importance based on gender , activity level , and competition level . Other variables ( e.g. , personality type , age , attribution , etc. ) not included in the current study might account for differences in motives both between and within groups ( Hinkle , Lyons , &; Burke , 1989 ) . Additionally , the reasons why individuals bicycle may change over time as cyclists experience various life changes ( i.e. family , children , job responsibilities , injury , etc. ) and/or move from competitive to non-competitive cycling . <p> The results of this study should be viewed in light of possible limitations including non - response bias and external validity . It may be possible that several respondents did not wish to participate in the online survey or did not see the survey 's announcement . However , recent research suggests that online surveys and pencil and paper surveys yield similar results ( Reips , 2002 ) . <p> In any case , coaches can use this information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual to ride a bike . Understanding the motives underlying one 's participation in the sport of cycling may increase exercise compliance , fitness , and the adoption of lifelong exercise behaviors . Individualized training programs may be important in increasing the performance goals of competitive cyclists . For example , it may be best to allow competitive cyclists to train on their own because problems may occur if these individual are required to make group decisions about training ( Gat &; McWhirter , 1998 ) . Training programs for non-competitive cyclists participating in a non- racing event ( i.e. century , charity rides ) might include more emphasis on enjoying the company of others and life meaning rather than on being the first to cross the finish line . Understanding that groups are not homogenous in their motives for participating in the sport of cycling may foster wider participation , provide a more satisfying experience , and promote lifetime participation in the sport of cycling .
