Just one of 600 sons , Speck wanted to be something more , something better ... something special . // // I like to think there was once a fish that did not like the idea of being a fish , and so let us believe this , for it may be true . He was a sardine . He lived in a school of sardines , and studied arithmetic . There were frequently as many as 100,000 other sardines in the school and never fewer than 30,000 . One day , one sardine said to another , " I believe there are fewer than 30,000 of us in this school . " " Do you really think so ? " the other sardine said . " Yes , " said the first sardine . " Well , perhaps then , " said the other , " we 'd better count . " So they did . They counted 30,003 sardines . " Well , " said the first sardine , " almost fewer than 30,000 . " Most of the time , though , there were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300,000 of them in the school . The population of the school would rise as new sardines were born , and it would fall as thousands of sardines were captured in nets by fishermen . Never , never in the history of sardines did one sardine wander away from the school and take up somewhere by himself . It never occurred to a sardine to do that . The sardine is a small fish , as fish go , and things like that do n't occur to them . It may be because the brain of the sardine is very small , or it may be because proportionately it is very large . It does n't matter . Sardines like to stay with sardines . They start life in a school and they stay in the school straight through to the end , only to sardines the end is not the end , the way it is to people . The popular attitude of people toward sardines is that they are n't much of a fish , being small , moving in large schools , and not having much intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There you find them four or five at a time , neatly spread out , without heads or tails , but with bones pretty much in place . This is because the bones are soft and tender , and just as good to eat as the rest of the sardine . I know , because years ago I ate a lot of sardines out of cans . Sometimes I preferred those that were packed in tomato sauce . Both sauces were good , and the cost of a can 30 years ago when I was most fond of sardines was well under 10 cents . These days the same sardines in the same can are a good deal more expensive . The price keeps going up , but the sardines remain the same . Now , everybody knows that fish live in the sea . Saltwater fish , at any rate . Trout live in streams , in fresh water , in melted snow or rain flowing in a river . Sardines live in the sea . The sea , it happens , is the biggest thing in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this planet as there is land . It is wonderful . But the remarkable thing about the sea is this : No kind of life that has stayed in the sea has done anything else . It is only after something in the sea has come on dry land that it has begun to do things . Once something comes up out of the sea and starts doing things there 's no end to it . The things of the sea seem to have always longed to leave the sea and get up onto the dry land , and yet no man , however old , has ever seen anything of the sea leave the sea and come to the land . But it happens all the time . It 's been happening , so they say , for millions of years . Well , if this is true , then it is not altogether unlikely that a sardine might appear in a school of sardines , with a longing to leave the other sardines , to leave the sea , and to get up onto the dry land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where our story begins . He was a regular sardine , precisely like all the others . He swam precisely the way all the others did . He was rather given to sporting about , too , after the manner of the others , but if you were to watch him steadily for the full minute you would notice that the expression on his face was frequently troubled . One day-our day-his mother noticed the troubled expression on his face and said : " You ! You over there , one of my 600 sons , what 's the matter with you ? " " I 'm lonesome , " the sardine said . " What name did I give you ? " " Speck . " " All right , Speck , where are your brothers , where are your sisters ? " " All around , I guess , " Speck said . " Well , go and play with them , " his mother said , " and stop being lonesome . " " I 'm lonesome when I play with them , too , " Speck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , " Speck 's mother said . " I ca n't devote all of my time to one son out of 600 or 700 , but if you 're troubled , tell me and perhaps you 'll feel better . Now what 's the trouble ? " " I do n't want to be a sardine , " Speck said . " You speak to your mother with respect , " Speck 's father said . Speck 's father did n't know whether to feel proud of so many children or ashamed . " I did n't mean to be disrespectful , " Speck said . " Was that respectful , what you said ? " his father said . " I just said I do n't want to be a sardine . " " What do you want to be ? " " Something else . " The father glanced at the mother . The father seemed angry , the mother frightened . " What 's this all about ? " the father said to the mother . " What kind of children are you bringing up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the mother said . " No need to be upset . " " No need to be upset ? " the father said . " The boy says he does n't want to be a sardine . He says he wants to be something else . And you say no need to be upset ! Sometimes I do n't know why I ever married you in the first place . Now straighten this boy out , please , do you hear ? " " Yes , " the mother said . The father turned his back on both of them , and the mother went to Speck and whispered to him . " You be good now , " she said . " Stop this nonsense . Straighten yourself out . Go over there and play with your brothers . " Speck was sorry to see his father and mother quarreling about him , but at the same time he needed somebody to talk to . Why would n't they talk to him ? He swam over to his brothers who were playing noseball , which is something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball ( which was a particle of something good to eat ) with his nose , and then when it looked as if he were going to score , he stopped pushing the ball . One of his brothers on the other team plunged at it , took it off quickly , and soon scored . All of his brothers on his side rushed over to him and said : " What 's the big idea ? Why do n't you play the game ? What 's the matter with you ? " " I do n't want to be a sardine . " " Ah , shut up , " his brothers said , and went off . Well , Speck did n't mind their going off , especially because he saw too much of them anyway and never felt lonesome for them . He felt lonesome for other things , only he did n't know what they were . Now he felt more lonesome . Speck saw his father still angry at his mother . He saw his mother still anxious about him , and a little angry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his sisters attending domestic science classes . The whole business made him desperately unhappy . Without really thinking about what he was doing , Speck turned suddenly and began to swim away from the school . He was going very swiftly when he thought he heard his mother call out his name , but he was n't sure . Besides , there was n't anything she could do to help him . He did n't want to be a sardine , and she wanted him to . The sensible thing to do was to go away . In not more than three minutes-for the school was located near the shore-Speck reached shallow water . He swam around in the shallow water for a little while , and then suddenly , again without thinking , he swam right out of the water and onto the moist sand . It was very strange there , but he liked it , even though it was an awful struggle to stay there . He struggled with the air , the light , the warmth and the sand for a long time . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood on the shore and looked back at the sea . Far far away he saw the school of sardines he had left , and he said aloud : " I 'm glad I 've left them . I 'm glad I 've left the sea . I 'm glad I 've reached the land . " Now , Speck looked around to see what he could see . He saw a whole city and decided to find out what it was like inside . It was n't made out of plants as the cities of the sea were . It was made out of stone and steel and glass and other things that did n't move . Speck walked to the city . He was a little afraid of the impression he would make on the others in the city , but he need n't have been , for by the time he was there among them he looked precisely as they did . That is what happened that day . That was the beginning . The rest is well known to everybody , but I 'll mention it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . It goes something like this : Speck got a job . He worked hard . He got a better job . He found a girl he liked . He worked harder than ever and got a better job . He married the girl . They moved to a new house . They had a son , then a daughter , then another son , then a daughter , and finally another son . They seemed to be one of the nicest familles ever , but one day Speck , when he was 67 years old , noticed that his youngest son , then 17 years old , seemed troubled , so Speck said to him , " What 's the matter with you , boy ? " " I 'm lonesome , " the boy said . " Do n't be silly , " Speck said . " You 're home , your father 's here , your mother 's here , your brothers and sisters are here . " " I 'm lonesome just the same , " Speck 's son said . " Why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy said . " I guess I just do n't want to be a human being , that 's all . " " Well , now is n't that just fine ? " Speck said . " Whether you like it or not , you are a human being , and there is n't anything else you can be . There is n't anything better to be . I 've gone to a lot of trouble getting here , and I should think you might show a little appreciation . " Speck 's son knew his father was right , but he just could n't help it . He was lonesome , and he just did n't like being a human being . He wanted to be something better only he did n't know what , or where to go in order to be what he believed he would rather be . He stayed home another year , and then one day he picked up and left . He penned a note for his father and mother . It was a fine intelligent well-written note . He told them he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he just had to go off on his own and find out for himself if he might not be something better than a human being . Speck 's son went around the world . One day he came back and found his father sitting on the front porch . " Is that you , Sandy ? " his father said . " Yes , " Sandy said . " Well , where have you been ? " " Around the world , " Sandy said . " I worked on ships and traveled around the world . " " What did you see ? " " Water , " Sandy said . " I saw the sea . " " How was it ? " " It seemed like home , " Sandy said . " I almost wished I could live in the sea . " " Is that so ? " Speck said . " What a strange thought . " For by now Speck had forgotten that he had once come from the sea . " Well , " he said , " let 's go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother see you again and prepare a nice meal for you . " Speck and Sandy went inside and Mrs. Speck wept for joy when she saw her son , and she prepared a fine lunch for him . It was sardines in tomato sauce , homemade bread and tea .
