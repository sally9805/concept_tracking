<p> Long before Alex Haley 's " Roots " miniseries transformed genealogy from a methodical pastime to a raging passion for millions of Americans , Tina Dunkley already had been wondering " who I was , where I came from and why I felt a hole in my soul . " <p> Now she 's got some answers  --  for $350 and a dab of saliva . <p> The 50-year-old Decatur artist knew she 'd been born in Brooklyn , N.Y. , that her mother had emigrated from Trinidad and her father from Jamaica . And that , growing up , she was a minority in a sea of white faces  --  mostly Jewish neighbors she envied because they knew where generations of their ancestors had come from . <p> All she knew was that hers on both sides had been among 12 million African slaves who 'd been brought to the New World sometime after 1600 . And she figured she 'd never know more . <p> She was wrong . <p> At a recent African-American arts festival , she heard that advances in DNA technology had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she ordered a DNA test kit containing Q-Tips-like swabs from African-Ancestry Inc. , a new company founded by Rick Kittles , a molecular biologist at Howard University . She took a sample from inside the cheeks of her 89-year-old mom and sent it in . And within a few weeks , she got back a " certificate of ancestry " stating that the sample exactly matched the DNA of the Temne peoples of modern-day Sierra Leone in western Africa . <p> Her heart leapt . <p> " It was wonderful , sacred information , a spiritual experience , " says Dunkley , director of Clark Atlanta University 's art gallery . <p> African-Ancestry , which opened in February , is one of a half-dozen U.S. companies that are cashing in on the latest in DNA advances to help thousands of people dig up their roots . The research is fueling a boom in genealogy , already the second biggest hobby in America behind gardening . <p> African-Ancestry matches DNA of clients with one or more of its 11,200 samples from people in 85 African ethnic groups ( formerly called tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found , says Gina Paige , the firm 's president . <p> Beyond commercial motivations , DNA research is mushrooming for another reason  --  public health . Scientists are studying ancestry to find out , for instance , why African-American women are three times as likely as white females to die of heart disease , why women of European heritage have a higher rate of osteoporosis than black women , and why Jewish women with European roots are more likely to develop breast cancer than non-Jewish females . <p> New DNA discoveries also are helping police solve crimes by identifying racial characteristics of suspects . And it 's telling anthropologists and historians more about humanity 's distant past , such as how , when and why people began moving out of Africa  --  and where they went . All humans share a common ancestor who lived in Africa about 150,000 years ago , well-documented by scientists worldwide . <p> Mark Shriver , a molecular anthropologist at Penn State University and a pioneer in the field , says genetic research also " can and should be used as a tool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new understanding that might help alleviate human suffering . " <p> Uncovering histories <p> Bruce Jackson , a molecular geneticist at Boston University , has launched the African-American DNA Roots Project , along with biologist Bert Ely of the University of South Carolina . They are collecting DNA from African-Americans in hopes of matching them with ethnic groups in Africa . <p> " African-Americans have a need to know , " Jackson said . " We lost our history 300 or 400 years ago . We 're trying to heal a deep wound . " <p> DNA databases also are being collected by molecular anthropologist Michael Hammer at the University of Arizona and other scientists around the world , at Brigham Young University in Utah , Oxford University in England , and several in Germany and France . <p> Shriver and colleague Tony Frudakis set up a company , DNA Print Genomics in Sarasota , Fla. , to capitalize on their own discoveries . <p> For a minimum of $158 , the company will analyze DNA of people who want to know more about their roots . <p> Scientists know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's that other 0.1 percent that can reveal clues , Frudakis says . DNA Print 's scientists identify markers or " signature characteristics " that vary substantially by race and are passed down through the generations . That test , which is so far unique , looks for " ancestry informative markers " that reveal a person 's proportions of four ancestries  --  European , African , Native American and East Asian . The company returns a certificate indicating the consumer 's " admixture , " identifying the proportion of each ancestry . <p> Other companies sell more specific tests that compare Y chromosomes inherited from male ancestors and mitochondrial DNA from females with databases of DNA from people indigenous to specific continents and regions . African-Ancestry and Family Tree DNA in Houston , for example , conduct these kinds of tests . Costs vary widely and can easily exceed $600 . Often , results surprise people . <p> For decades , 61-year-old Sharon Mock Whitaker of Clarkston used traditional genealogical methods and traced her family roots on paper . She discovered her father 's ancestors hailed from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing let her go a step further . She sent a sample from her father to Family Tree DNA . His sample matched the genetic material of a man from the ancient Jewish Cohanim priestly caste , which goes back thousands of years . <p> " It had never occurred to me that there was any Jewish in me at all , " she says . " It 's fascinating . This seems logical , because the Jews were persecuted so badly in Europe . " She speculates some ancestor may have been forced to convert to Christianity , as Jews were during the Spanish Inquisition , which began in 1478 . <p> No one 's quite sure where tomorrow 's tests will lead . <p> " It 's a new technology just in its infancy , " Jackson says . <p> Let the buyer beware <p> Most findings of the DNA companies mean nothing legally but are probably legit , says Henry Greely , a professor of law who specializes in genetics and ethics at Stanford University in California . <p> " I know these scientists , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpromise , " he says . <p> Most firms require clients to sign psychological releases absolving companies from responsibility if results do n't jibe with client expectations . <p> Still , Jackson cautions that " like anything on the Internet , this is all a case of ' caveat emptor '  --  let the buyer beware . But the science is valid . There 's no doubt about the science . " He sees DNA as " the hottest new tool " in genealogy , which is why Web sites on the subject run second only in hits to pornography pages . <p> This kind of research is not controversial among most scientists and anthropologists , but some fear some people could use it to try to devise a formula for racism . <p> " You wo n't discover your lust for potato pancakes can be explained genetically , " says Arthur Caplan , head of the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania . He worries that racists , for example , may twist findings to support their prejudices . <p> " The tests may be scientifically valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trouble . " <p> Oral traditions tested <p> Bennett Greenspan , president of Family Tree DNA , estimates that hundreds of thousands of practicing Jews and people who had some Jewish ancestors carry the Cohanim DNA marker . <p> " We are also finding that many people who have an oral tradition of being Jewish but no proof because a Jewish ancestor converted a long time ago will sort with Jews , " he says . " Given that General Wesley Clark 's father was a Kanne , perhaps a Cohen , I 'd love to test him . " <p> Clark , a Democratic presidential contender , found out as an adult that one of his grandfathers , Jacob Nemerovsky , was a Russian Jew who fled the country a century ago to escape persecution . <p> " We get a call a day from someone who wants to know if they have Jewish ancestry and if we can tell by running a DNA test , " Greenspan says . <p> But he 's excited at the possibility of surprises that seem to keep cropping up , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested members of the Lemba group in Africa  --  who have an oral tradition that their ancestors left the Holy Land thousands of years ago . Despite some skepticism , they found that many of the Africans had genetic signatures of Jews . <p> Surprises may await <p> Such studies are only starting to scratch the surface , Greenspan says . Several are slated for peer-reviewed publication in January and February , including one by Jackson asserting that Mende and Temne peoples account for 60 percent of the population of Sierra Leone . He says the study will make it easier for many African-Americans to trace their roots . <p> Frudakis and Shriver say interpreting some results is trickier . Some people who know they have indigenous roots in America get back results showing they have some East Asian genes , says Frudakis . This probably means their distant ancestors made the migration over the Bering Strait bridge from Asia later than other native peoples , starting some 20,000 years ago . That 's why C.M. Pascal , a 61-year-old self-described Mexican-American from Dallas , was surprised when her results from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent Native American and 38 percent East Asian . <p> " DNA Print told me it was because of migration patterns , that my indigenous ancestors immigrated later than people who show up as Native American , who came earlier , " Pascal said . <p> Most people who get back surprising results are whites who learn they had Native American or African ancestors , but a few African-Americans find out their dark skin came from indigenous Americans . <p> So far , DNA Print alone has done more than 4,000 tests on individuals like Helen Hoverman , 42 , of Buford . <p> The native of Puerto Rico figured her test would say she was mostly Native American , with some European . That would have meshed with family legend and her " fairly dark skin , dark hair and brown eyes . " <p> Instead , it said she was 43 percent European , 8 percent East Asian and 49 percent African . <p> " I was surprised , but that clarifies my dark skin , " she says . <p> She and her husband have a 5-month-old daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test says he 's 99 percent European and 1 percent East Asian . <p> " It 's good for her to know her heritage , " she says . <p> Adds husband Chris , 45 : " It 's interesting , knowing how we 're all blending , and more and more in recent years . " <p> Many happy customers <p> Most who take the tests are grateful that their own DNA can , in a sense , speak from uncountable graves . A.J. Hightower , 47 , of Augusta found out that some of her ancestors originated in eastern Africa , " and the knowledge moved me very much . " She also learned that some male ancestors were European . <p> " Everyone in the family will appreciate knowing more about our roots , " she says . " I think of it as a gift that I will be giving them . " <p> And Bill Brazil , 69 , of Blairsville has given himself a gift . After trying for years to become a member of the Sons of the American Revolution , his paper trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the same names . But Family Tree DNA had collected DNA from family members , and one matched Brazil 's . And the man whose DNA matched Brazil 's had been able to prove conclusively  --  the old-fashioned way  --  that he was a direct descendant of the Revolutionary soldier . That proved Brazil was , too . <p> Now , he says happily , he 's a member of the SAR . Here are some interesting tidbits about genealogy from scientists : <p> * 70 percent of African-Americans , about 24 million , have measurable white ancestry . <p> * 9 percent of whites , about 20 million , have some African ancestry . <p> * 30 percent of African-American men have Y chromosomes that match those of white Europeans . <p> * All of us have or had four grandparents and eight great-grand- parents , but bet you did n't know that around the year 1800 , you had 1,024 direct ancestors . <p> * If you could go back in time 14 generations , you 'd have 16,384 direct ancestors . <p> * 25 generations ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * Go back to the time of Jesus , about 2,000 years ago , and you 'd have **47;4623;TOOLONG ancestors . Read that 126.7 decillion . Of course , that 's far more people than were alive on the planet at the time , which means millions of your ancestors were related . <p> * All humans share a common ancestor , a woman who lived in Africa 150,000 years ago .  --  Bill Hendrick ; Photo : Lloyd Mock , 89 , and his daughter , Sharon Mock Whitaker , 61 , of Clarkston , have been studying their family 's genealogy for years . Now with the help of DNA tests , they are able to get around the roadblocks of traditional family searches .
