<p> We asked you to tell us about comics  --  the ones you like and the ones you 'd like to see . <p> You said you wanted some new ones . <p> So get ready : Starting Monday , we 're adding five comic strips to our pages . They are : " Kevin &; Kell , " " La Cucaracha , " " Luann , " " Non Sequitur " and " Rose Is Rose . " <p> Next week , you 'll see four of these in the Sunday comics as well . ( The fifth , " Kevin &; Kell , " will be added later . ) <p> These changes come as a result of the 2003 AJC Comics Survey . Back in September , we invited readers to tell us what they thought of our comics lineup . We also asked you to evaluate 10 potential new comics after a weeklong tryout . We said we 'd use the results to help us determine whether to make changes in our comics lineup . <p> More than 7,000 readers responded , and today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for . <p> In a nutshell , you told us that some of our regular comics have lost their appeal for most readers , and that you 'd like to see these five new strips in the paper . For more on the survey , see related stories on this page and inside . <p> ( You also told us you wanted to see the new " Opus " comic by Berkeley Breathed , who did " Bloom County " in the 1980s . We began running that Sunday comic when it started on Nov. 23 . ) <p> And now , starting Monday , please welcome five new faces on our comics pages . Here 's the scoop on each : <p> ' Kevin &; Kell ' <p> Newspapers get most comics from syndicates based in New York ; Chicago ; Kansas City , Mo. ; and Los Angeles , but for " Kevin &; Kell " the AJC went to the Internet for the work of a metro Atlantan . <p> Cartoonist Bill Holbrook , who lives in Monroe , draws and writes two comics for King Features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , but in 1995 he began " Kevin &; Kell " exclusively for online readers . <p> " The Internet was bursting out in 1995 , and I really wanted to do something to explore the nature of the medium , " Holbrook says . " I 've been able to do longer story lines than in his two traditional newspaper comics because of the online archives . They allow readers to not get lost in the middle of a story . " <p> Holbrook grew up in Huntsville , Ala. , and graduated from Auburn University . He worked as an editorial staff artist at the AJC from 1981 to 1984 , quitting after his first comic , " On the Fastrack , " was picked up for syndication by King Features . A few days before " Fastrack " made its debut , he met Teri Peitso on a blind date . They were married a year later and have two daughters . <p> For " Kevin &; Kell , " Holbrook created an alternate Earth where humans do n't exist and all the animals are intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kevin and Kell are a functional family in a dysfunctional world , overcoming differences in a place where there are no rules , " Holbrook says . " I can view all human differences through this prism , which allows me to comment in universal fashion . " <p> Kevin and Kell Dewclaw live in Domain , a city in an urban area that resembles Atlanta . They met regularly in an online chat room , falling in love before they realized they were on different ends of the food chain . Kevin , a 6-foot-tall rabbit , runs HareLink , an Internet service provider for herbivores . His wife , Kell , is a wolf who works as a staff predator for HerdThinners Inc . Their family includes adopted 17-year-old daughter Lindesfarne , a hedgehog ; Rudy , 14 , Kell 's wolf cub from a previous marriage ; and their 1-year-old baby , Coney , who inherited Kevin 's bunny look and Kell 's carnivorous appetite . There 's also a large secondary cast of friends , neighbors and co-workers . <p> Holbrook has selected eight weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; K " world , but after that the same strip will appear daily in the paper and on his Web site , www.kevinandkell.com . That site also has background information and an archive of all eight-plus years of " K &; K " strips . <p> ' La Cucaracha ' <p> Lalo Alcaraz was born in San Diego of Mexican immigrant parents , and says that 's given him a dual outlook on life : He 's not " Mexican " enough for his relatives in Mexico and not " American " enough for some people here . The result is a double-edged Spanglish attitude that fuels the satirical observations in his Latino-themed comic strip , " La Cucaracha . " <p> Alcaraz graduated from San Diego State University and the University of California , Berkeley , where he earned a master 's degree in architecture . He began drawing editorial cartoons for L.A. Weekly in 1992 and soon created Cuco Rocha , his cockroach character , for a panel called " L.A. Cucaracha . " Recast as a syndicated comic strip , " La Cucaracha " began appearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional Mexican song about a cockroach . <p> The strip has four main characters . Eddie is an easygoing , optimistic Mexican-American who does n't pay too much attention to the problems of life or the world . Eddie 's roommate is Cuco Rocha , a politically radical Chicano hipster who happens to be a man-size cockroach . Cuco loves to rage on and on about the injustices of the world but does little to change them . Neto , Eddie 's little brother , is a bicultural teenager of the Net generation : He absorbs the world through media , music and the Internet , has a short attention span and lacks good human interaction skills . Finally , there 's Vero , Eddie 's girlfriend , a strong-willed young Latina who stands up to the world and is infinitely more practical than the " dumb guys " around her . <p> Alcaraz lives in Los Angeles with his wife , Victoria , a public school teacher , and two children . <p> ' Luann ' <p> Some readers will recognize Luann from her 1994-1996 run on the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 , cartoonist Greg Evans " aged " her to 16 to keep the character fresh by confronting her with such issues as dating and getting a driver 's license . <p> He 's also won praise ( and some criticism ) by having other " Luann " stories touch on real issues that teens face , including puberty and menstruation , unrequited love , date rape , cancer , dealing with peer pressure , and drugs , alcohol and shoplifting . " I 've always felt that adolescence is a very funny time , except when you 're in it , " Evans says . " My aim is to touch readers ' hearts as well as their funny bones , to enlighten as well as to entertain . " <p> Evans grew up in Burbank , Calif. , and says he 's been drawing cartoons for as long as he can remember . He 's worked as an art teacher , a graphics artist and promotion manager for a Colorado TV station and as a magazine cartoonist . He tried several concepts for a syndicated comic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preteen daughter . <p> In the strip , Luann DeGroot is an average 16-year-old girl who contends with often clueless parents and her brother Brad , " a slobby , greedy , selfish , lazy waste of carbon . " She hangs out with girlfriends Bernice and Delta , competes with rival Tiffany for boys , adores Aaron Hill but also has a soft spot for Spanish exchange student Miguel , and likes sweet , nerdy Gunther Berger , who has a huge crush on her . <p> ' Non Sequitur ' <p> As an editorial cartoonist for several newspapers , Wiley Miller eventually tired of taking pokes at politics and the economy . In 1992 , he turned his caustic humor and skewed outlook on the absurdities of everyday life into a comic called " Non Sequitur . " The title is the Latin phrase for " it does not follow , " meaning a remark or conclusion that does n't follow logically from what came before . <p> Most days , " Non Sequitur " skips from topic to topic  --  boorish airline passengers , greedy lawyers , nonsensical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no continuing characters . But it occasionally makes use of recurring characters , such as Obviousman , a superhero whose power is pointing out the obvious . Danae , a cynical little girl with a tiny horse named Lucy , makes frequent appearances . <p> Miller was born in California and spent his high school years in Virginia . He has worked as an editorial cartoonist for the Greensboro N.C. News and Record , the Santa Rosa Calif . Press Democrat and the San Francisco Examiner . Miller lives in Santa Barbara , Calif. , with his wife and two daughters . <p> ' Rose Is Rose ' <p> Take one simple , warm-and-fuzzy family unit  --  a homemaker , her husband and their son  --  and spice with wild imaginations , changing viewpoints and tricks of perspective . The result is " Rose Is Rose , " cartoonist Pat Brady 's strip about the life of Rose Gumbo . <p> Rose is a model domestic engineer , but with a single stray thought , her imagination can turn her into Vicki the Biker , a long-tressed adventuress in a leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open road . Jimbo , Rose 's blue-collar husband , is an incurable romantic  --  and admirerer of large women  --  who only wishes there were more of her to love . Their son , Pasquale , is sweet and loving , and his imaginary wanderings in his Dreamship , sometimes accompanied by his guardian angel , rival his mom 's . Rounding out the family is the cat , Peekaboo , who studies her humans from her own feline perspective . <p> Born in Louisville , Ky. , Brady started submitting comics to newspapers at age 11 . He studied art at the University of Wisconsin and worked in the catalog and retail art departments of Montgomery Ward for 12 years before starting " Rose Is Rose " in 1984 . He lives in Sycamore , Ill .
