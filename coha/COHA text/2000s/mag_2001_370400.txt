Some places the border is a muddy river , too thin to plow , too thick to drink . Other places it 's just a line in the sand . Over the years mapmakers redrew it , wars moved it , nature yanked it all around as the course of the Rio Grande shifted . But what would it take to make it disappear altogether ? <P> If today is like any other day , this is what is going to cross the line from Mexico : a million barrels of crude oil , 432 tons of bell peppers , 238,000 light bulbs , 166 brand-new Volkswagen Beetles , 16,250 toasters , $51 million worth of auto parts , everything from the little plastic knob on the air conditioner to your cell-phone charger . It all comes in trucks and boxcars and little panel vans , and that 's just the stuff that Customs can keep track of . There is also the vast shadow market  --  not just the cocaine and heroin and freshly laundered money but also cut-price Claritin and steroids and banned bug killers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> And then there are the people , more than 800,000 crisscrossing legally every day , some walking , more driving , not to mention the 4,600 or so who hop the fence and get caught a few minutes or hours later . The ones who make it are on their way to jobs as meat packers in Iowa and carpetmakers in Georgia and gardeners in Pennsylvania . They want to be in the U.S. so badly they will risk the scorpions and the rattlesnakes , the surveillance cameras and underground sensors ; they will fold into hidden compartments behind the dashboard of a car or in the belly of a tanker truck . They know they can get a job no one else wants , save some money , send some home , maybe find a way to bring their family  --  because someday this border may not look anything like what it does now : a barbed-wire paradox , half pried open , half bolted closed . <P> So , how much has to cross a border before it might as well not be there at all ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , stories and songs , values , instincts , attitudes , and none of those stop in El Paso , Texas , or San Diego , Calif. , anymore . The Old World fades away  --  salsa is more popular than ketchup ; Salma Hayek is bigger than Madonna  --  and the border is everywhere . One day soon it may seem a little backward for someone in the U.S. not to speak some Spanish , even the hybrid Spanglish of the Southwest : " Como se llama your dog ? " Signs appear in the store windows of Garden City , Kans. , that say SE HABLA ESPANOL , and you can buy extremely fresh mangoes at bodegas all over that town . Dalton , Ga . ( pop . 27,900 ) , has three Spanish-language newspapers . Says longtime resident Edwin Mitchell , 77 : " We 're a border community  --  1,000 miles away from the border . " Already we are living in a whole new world . <P> Sometime in the next few years , Mexico will pass Canada as the U.S. 's top trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest minority , the swing vote to woo , the constituency to grab . If Presidents George W. Bush and Vicente Fox manage to solve the problems of two countries that need each other but do n't completely trust each other , the American Century could give way to the Century of the Americas and the border might as well have disappeared altogether .
