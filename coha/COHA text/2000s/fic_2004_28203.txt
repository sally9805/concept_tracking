Chapter One It is not so uncommon for those near the end of their lives to run their mind 's hand over the contours of those lives . Perhaps that is all that I do here as I reach across the populated spaces of time , geography , and language , reach from a comfortable New York apartment to a city once and again called Saint Petersburg . * * * The anniversary of our wedding day fell on the last of the early summer 's white nights , and I could still believe that we would be fine . We dined at a restaurant that had been better a few years earlier but was still very good . Our window overlooked the Neva . The Peter and Paul Fortress lifted from the center of the river . Its bastion tilted slightly over the water , seeming more precarious than fortified , pointing askew to a sky more bright than light , a sky the creamy white color of the anona tree 's sweet custard apple . Alena 's voice floated lighter on the air than it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate saltiness from the leg casings of huge crabs , spooning caviar directly into our mouths and sliding it down our throats with a white-grape wine that was just too sweet but good nonetheless . I kept the check from Alena . She believed that the loss of her salary and the approach of Hitlerite Germany 's young soldiers meant that we should hold tight to our money . Like the smell of rain before drops hit the skin , the coming war told me to spend , to have whatever I could now , before it could no longer be had . It would be later that I would learn to hoard crumbs like a miser . I desired to go straight home and make love to the only woman I was allowing myself , the only one I really wanted . But Alena had heard on the radio the poet Vera Inber , whose account of the long days and nights ahead would secure her fame and favor , and wished to attend a reading she was giving . We walked along Nevsky Prospect , which had widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year when the sun would go to the horizon but no lower . I held Alena close , by her arm , and then closer , my arm around her waist . Every fabricated thing in Leningrad , from the antique ornaments atop monument gates to the nouveau wire poles , pointed upward , elegant , futile . The small hall where the reading was held was full and very hot and smoky , something I would savor often in memory but did not enjoy at the time . I remember few of Vera Inber 's words . But those of the reputationless poet who preceded her have remained long with me . Tall and sturdy , he had been a sailor before he seized a pen . He appeared hale on first glance , but the gray folded into his face and the depth and yellow of his eyes gave away some disease of the internal organs . He read several poems , none of them particularly to my taste , in a strong voice that was decidedly more naval than poetic . The last is the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I offer it now to begin my own story . I never saw the poem on paper , so I do not know how the sailor-turned-poet broke his lines . But I recall each word as spoken : " The ones who drown never change the facts , but those who survive the sea in their lungs must send their stories on words , words like small leaky boats , across the distance , cold , and currents of that water . " * * * The volunteers of the opolchenia , including my Alena but not myself , scurried like rodents . Shelters appeared , and trenches . Young women pierced their skin wrapping barbed wire around obstacles built to prevent tanks from penetrating the city . We all waited for the attack and prepared to defend our city block by block , building by building , hand to hand . But the tanks never rolled in . They stopped outside the city , and how much simpler it would have been had they kept coming . * * * In early September , the first Hitlerite shells descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Junkers rose and fell , rose and fell , leaving behind deposits of incendiaries like so much fatal silt . When they hit the Badayev warehouses , the cramped lines of wooden buildings burned fast , and the fats stored within their boards radiated red heat , turning the close sky to embers and filling the air like summer cooking . What did not burn were a few thousand tons of sugar , which instead melted through the floor planks to survive , shaped and imprinted by the cellars , as a hard candy . This candy was broken into chips that would be prized and sold for money and sex in the months that followed . But so much would be passed off and paid for as food . * * * Among the many thousands of specimens housed at the institute were several hundred tubers . Small and large . Smooth and warty . White , brown , yellow , purple , and blue . Lidia , my longtime sometime lover , had helped collect the blue potatoes on an expedition to Ecuador and Peru . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lidia collected more than the institute needed , and when she returned , we spent an afternoon in her apartment , peeling , cutting , frying , and feeding the blue chips to each other , licking salt and oil from each other 's fingers and the corners of each other 's mouths . Among its many fine qualities , in addition to its deeply earthy taste and sublime color , that particular species of Peruvian blue potato is resistant to the potato blight that starved a million Irish men , women , and children . * * * Heat was gone by the end of September , and all the pipes in Leningrad froze . Until the snow came , we had for washing only muddy Neva water , carried by hand in pails . * * * When we made the decision not to eat the obvious , it was not made all at once but by something like attrition . But it was formalized at a particular moment of a particular day . Before that , we could have still backed away , allowed our unofficial resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for her brilliance . I could not have told you if she was married or single , where she had been born , nor how she spent her leisure . She was a woman of few extraneous words . Only once had I seen her verbally agitated - happily so , over research results that were better than she had dared to hope . She had reported them to me rapidly , even breathlessly . When she stopped speaking , it was abrupt . She tucked some loose hair behind her ear , looked up at me from that cut angle , turned , and walked away . It was the only time I had seen her speak unnecessarily . Some months later , when the findings that had so animated Efrosinia appeared in the very best international journal and caused a stir across the Atlantic , she said nothing but acknowledged our congratulations with only a nod . So it was surprising , to say the least , that she called a meeting - invited everyone . She invited those of us who had been at the institute with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of libelers , quacks , opportunists , and mere quietists who had come in since . And everyone came , nearly filling our large conference room . Efrosinia said what we had been saying tentatively to one another . " We will not eat from the collections , then . We will protect them at all cost . " Efrosinia spoke no more that day . It was others who debated , though the debate was less than I might have thought , less than I might have wanted . Perhaps I wished for a loud din of opposing voices in which to conceal my meek objections to the noble plan . I said nothing . My Alena spoke briefly in favor of the plan . Vitalii spoke elegantly and - the only one to do so - at length . Even then we all knew that he would be the first to die . It was not that he was the smallest or weakest . Indeed he was tall and as hardened off as a plant that had never known the indoors . He had been an alpine skier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards during the 1920s . He still had the great , wide shoulders , and now , in middle age , plenty of extra pounds around his once athletic waist . We knew that Vitalii would be the first to die - not , as I have said , because he was the slightest or most vulnerable , not because he had the fewest stores . We knew because it was plain on his face , as plain as the square outside in the bright winter sun on one of Leningrad 's thirty-five cloudless days , plain for all but him to see . Would he have been so brave and clear in our deliberations , the staunchest advocate of martyrdom , our standard-bearer , had he known he would not only die but die first of all ? No , I believed then and believe even now . But Vitalii and Efrosinia and , yes , my Alena , carried that day . ( Continues ... )
