<p> The number of Georgia children left home without adequate supervision has been on the rise for at least six years , a trend that has resulted in the deaths or serious injuries of a half-dozen children in metro Atlanta in the last six months . <p> The tragedies  --  including the deaths of two Cherokee County brothers in a house fire last week  --  highlight what some officials already know . <p> " This is a big , big problem , " said Renee Huie , spokeswoman for the state Division of Family and Children Services . " All our numbers are increasing . Everything is going to hell . " <p> And the recent deaths have forced some parents to question leaving their kids alone . <p> Tara Unger , a single mother in Atlanta , said on occasion when she 's been ill , " it certainly crossed my mind to go to CVS " for medicine , reasoning that her toddler , Lily , was asleep . <p> But ultimately , she said , " I would never take that chance . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.3 million children under 13 are left alone for at least a few hours each week , according to data analyzed from the U.S. Census Bureau . Almost 900,000 of those children are between 6 and 9 years old , according to Child Trends , a nonprofit research group based in Washington . <p> In Georgia , unsupervised children make up the largest number of cases reported to DFACS , Huie said . <p> " Every individual case is different , " said Dee Simms , the state 's child advocate , adding that most cases of " self-care " occur because parents ca n't afford child care , they 're involved in drug abuse or just make bad choices . <p> In 2002 , the most recent year for which statistics are available , DFCS received 32,385 reports of substantiated cases of neglect . Of those , the agency confirmed 16,188 incidents of inadequate supervision falling outside its guidelines . <p> In 2001 , there were 28,211 substantiated cases of neglect . Of those , 14,399 were confirmed incidents of inadequate supervision . Those numbers compare to 23,703 case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Middle-class children under 13 are more likely to be left alone than those from impoverished neighborhoods . Researchers say richer children are often home alone because both parents are employed and they believe their neighborhoods are safe and their kids are reliable . <p> Freda Rumph said she feels comfortable leaving her boys , ages 9 and 14 , alone for brief periods because she has the support of a close-knit neighborhood and she trusts them to follow the rules . <p> She started when her oldest turned 10 , but for no longer than a half-hour at a time . " If I lived in an apartment complex , I 'd be more reluctant , " Rumph says . <p> Even so , her sons are under strict orders to stay inside when alone . They also must not answer the phone or the door , turn on the stove or use the microwave oven . <p> " If you do n't have a child you completely trust , " she says , " do n't leave them if your life depends on it . " <p> About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " self-care , " according to 1999 statistics analyzed by Child Trends . Among higher-income households , 17 percent of children were found to spend an average of about four hours a week by themselves . <p> Both numbers , researchers say , are probably " conservative , " because of parents ' hesitation to admit leaving their kids alone . <p> Running to the store <p> Georgia , like every other state , does not have any statutes outlining when children are considered old enough to stay home alone . <p> DFCS , however , has a set of guidelines , Huie said : Children older than 12 generally can be left alone and can baby-sit their younger siblings . Children between ages 8 and 12 can be left alone briefly , and children under age 8 should never be left alone . <p> When investigated , parents give a range of reasons for leaving their children  --  from going to work to taking a weekend vacation to running to a grocery store . <p> Fulton County Juvenile Court Chief Judge Nina Hickson , 43 , was investigated by DFCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November and left her 4-year-old daughter alone asleep . Her daughter was later found wandering a half-mile away , in search of her mother . <p> DFCS closed the case within five days , saying it was a one-time case of neglect . But a judicial review panel is still debating whetherHickson should be removed from the bench . She has taken a paid leave of absence , and has declined interviews . <p> Most recently , Christopher Johnson , 13 , and Jeffrey Johnson , 11 , died Monday after their home caught fire around 4:30 a.m . Their parents , John and Belinda Johnson , said they left the house to get milk . Gas and electric service had never been turned on by the family . They were using kerosene heaters . <p> In addition to the Johnson brothers , other children have met tragic ends while left alone . <p> * Five-year-old Tacara Judon was killed and her 10-year-old brother , Ronald Porter , critically injured early Feb. 7 after being beaten in their beds with a wrench . Their mother 's former boyfriend , Dwight Foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery . Their mother , Octavia Judon , had left the children home while she visited a male acquaintance . <p> * Three siblings  --  ages 11 , 13 , and 14  --  died in a late October house fire in northwest Atlanta . Their mother , Christine Jones , returned home from work about 7 a.m. while firefighters were still on the scene . <p> * A 2-year-old girl , Tyagan Slocum , was killed in September by a single blow to the head , police say . She was left in the care of a 12-year-old boy , who was charged with involuntary manslaughter . There were conflicting reports on how many young children were left in his care , but he was the oldest child at the Riverdale home . <p> A last resort <p> Virginia Lago , a Duluth interior designer and mother of three , says she simply never felt comfortable leaving her young children alone . <p> " I would n't go , " she says . " It 's as simple as that . " <p> But now , with her oldest being 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-year-old brother  --  but never for long stretches . Many moms acknowledge that sometimes it 's tempting to test the boundaries , especially if there are n't a lot of other options . <p> Terrian Wade of College Park admits she has made a leap of faith . " I 've done that twice , " she said . " I 'm almost ashamed to say it , but I have . " <p> While the single mother of four said she would never leave her two youngest sons alone , she has left the two older children , ages 9 and 10 , while she made a quick trip to the corner store for bread . <p> If she needs to be gone longer than that , she relies on the children 's grandparents and godmother , she said . <p> But many families do n't have such networks  --  especially in impoverished neighborhoods that also might be struggling with crime and unsafe housing , said says Richard Wexler , executive director of the National Coalition of Child Protection Reform . <p> " The real solution is help with housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wexler said . " Before you punish poor people for their choices , see what happens when you actually give them a choice . " <p> Simms said her office is reviewing the Cherokee County children 's deaths to determine what can be done to ensure the safety of other kids . <p> With that , she reminds parents of the simple truth : Children will act like children . " I think parents oftentimes assume their children will know what to do in a life-or-death situation , " she said . " But they do n't .
