The man leaned forward on his stool to make room for a big-boned redhead who was reaching for the two glasses of pinot grigio she 'd ordered . He asked for another Heineken while the bartender was down his way , figuring he could enjoy a second beer before anyone in the restaurant bothered to take note of him . <p> He was good at blending into the background in even the most generic settings , but he certainly was n't going to stand out here , given the commotion at the other end of the bar . Four men in suits and loosened ties were throwing back limoncello shots , their second round with the group of girls that had brought the man to the restaurant in the first place . Actually , his interest was not in all three-just the tall blond one . <p> He was used to taking more time with his selections , but he needed to find a girl tonight . This would be his first time on a schedule , let alone a tight one . NoLIta had seemed as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of booze . Lots of beautiful young people trying so hard to have fun that they paid little attention to someone like him . <p> He had been wandering the neighborhood for about half an hour when he 'd spotted the trio crossing Prince Street , the blonde the obvious leader . The other two were nothing special : one average-looking brunette in average-looking clothes ; the other , petite one slightly more interesting with her close-cropped black hair and bright yellow dress . <p> But it was the tall blonde who was a head-turner , and she knew it . She wore tight black pants and a low-cut red satin tank over a gravity-defying push-up bra . Topping off the ensemble was a well-placed V-shaped choker necklace-the equivalent of a vertical arrow sign hanging from her clavicle , instructing , " Direct Gaze Here .

He even had a chance to speak to her briefly when she split off from her friends to go to the restroom . That had been risky on his part . But her two gal pals were so smitten with the limoncello boys that they had n't noticed the exchange . <p> He felt a twinge of disappointment as the hostess notified the girls their table was ready . Then he heard a male voice . " Stay for one more shot . " Apparently the men in suits believed that plying the girls with drinks was going to get them somewhere . <p> Instead , the short girl in the yellow dress handed one of the men her cell phone and asked him to take a picture of the three friends . Mission accomplished , the brunettes followed the hostess to their table with barely a thank-you to their liquor-pouring benefactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she trailed along . <p> The decibel level in the bar area fell noticeably in the wake of the girls ' departure . The other patrons seemed relieved , but he took it as a signal to leave . <p> On Mott , he walked north toward Houston , forcing himself to adopt a leisurely pace . His car was parked only ten blocks away , and the girls would need at least an hour for dinner . <p> He had plenty of time . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
