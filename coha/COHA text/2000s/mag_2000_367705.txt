If you want to glimpse true parental devotion , head to the local mall in Vicksburg , Miss . Just past the JCPenney and the KB Toys , right across from the Corn Dog 7 , you 'll find a storefront occupied by Redwood Elementary School . A mannequin in the school 's red-and-blue uniform presides over a spread of student-made dioramas and papier-mache , painstakingly displayed by Redwood parents in an all-day decorating marathon . On a recent Saturday , the school 's choir serenaded shoppers while a troop of parent volunteers was on hand with brochures extolling the virtues of a Redwood education  --  and urging shoppers to sign up their kids . " I can already see the day when parents of newborns will call me up and say they want to register their kids at Redwood , " says principal Butch Newman . <P> Just a year ago , Vicksburg parents were n't such loyal customers . Like most school districts along the lower Mississippi , Vicksburg 's had long hovered outside the orbit of education reformers . It was still largely segregated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools were so overcrowded that at one building three teachers held class in the gymnasium at the same time . So parents took to voting with their feet . And their skin . Many white parents fled to private and parochial schools , while others began home schooling . Some black parents , convinced the schools in their neighborhoods were worse off academically , gave the district fake addresses in order to attend majority-white schools .

Perhaps more important , the district confronted its longtime racial standoff , engaging the black parents and wooing the white parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat parents like shareholders in their children 's education , " says now retired superintendent Robert Pickett , who designed the plan . " We did whatever we could to get them to buy in . " That meant closing down five schools that were in the worst disrepair , renovating the rest and building two schools from scratch on the outskirts of town . The district installed parents on its strategic-planning committee . Then it increased the rigor of its curriculum , asking parents to vote on an academic focus for each of the schools . At one writing , communication and technology school , for example , students keep a daily journal starting in kindergarten ; at a math and science school , students study botany in a state-of-the-art outdoor classroom . To reach the most disengaged parents , the district mounted a full-scale media blitz , postering walls from the city health department to K Mart and taking flyers door to door . The individual schools sent home mass mailings and bought competing ads in the local paper . The district even promised free rides to parents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
