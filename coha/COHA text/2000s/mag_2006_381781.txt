You do n't have to be a biologist or an anthropologist to see how closely the great apes  --  gorillas , chimpanzees , bonobos and orangutans  --  resemble us . Even a child can see that their bodies are pretty much the same as ours , apart from some exaggerated proportions and extra body hair . Apes have dexterous hands much like ours but unlike those of any other creature . And , most striking of all , their faces are uncannily expressive , showing a range of emotions that are eerily familiar . That 's why we delight in seeing chimps wearing tuxedos , playing the drums or riding bicycles . It 's why a potbellied gorilla scratching itself in the zoo reminds us of Uncle Ralph or Cousin Vinnie  --  and why , in a more unsettled reaction , Queen Victoria , on seeing an orangutan named Jenny at the London Zoo in 1842 , declared the beast " frightful and painfully and disagreeably human . " <P> It is n't just a superficial resemblance . Chimps , especially , not only look like us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make and use tools and teach those skills to their offspring . They prey on other animals and occasionally murder each other . They have complex social hierarchies and some aspects of what anthropologists consider culture . They ca n't form words , but they can learn to communicate via sign language and symbols and to perform complex cognitive tasks . Scientists figured out decades ago that chimps are our nearest evolutionary cousins , roughly 98% to 99% identical to humans at the genetic level . When it comes to DNA , a human is closer to a chimp than a mouse is to a rat . <P> Yet tiny differences , sprinkled throughout the genome , have made all the difference . Agriculture , language , art , music , technology and philosophy  --  all the achievements that make us profoundly different from chimpanzees and make a chimp in a business suit seem so deeply ridiculous  --  are somehow encoded within minute fractions of our genetic code . Nobody yet knows precisely where they are or how they work , but somewhere in the nuclei of our cells are handfuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that endow us with the brainpower to outthink and outdo our closest relatives on the tree of life . They give us the ability to speak and write and read , to compose symphonies , paint masterpieces and delve into the molecular biology that makes us what we are . <P> Until recently , there was no way to unravel these crucial differences . Exactly what gives us advantages like complex brains and the ability to walk upright  --  and certain disadvantages , including susceptibility to a particular type of malaria , AIDS and Alzheimer 's , that do n't seem to afflict chimps  --  remained a mystery . <P> But that 's rapidly changing . Just a year ago , geneticists announced that they had sequenced a rough draft of the chimpanzee genome , allowing the first side-by-side comparisons of human and chimpanzee DNA . Already , that research has led to important discoveries about the development of the human brain over the past few million years and possibly about our ancestors ' mating behavior as well .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
