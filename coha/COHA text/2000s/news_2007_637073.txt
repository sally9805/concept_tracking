<p> Mary and Marguerite Williamson began making funeral plans in a Houston hospital room when they learned that Gary 's kidney cancer had spread to his liver . After eight years of fighting the disease , he had only a few weeks to live . <p> " We were talking about the funeral arrangements , where it would be , where the reception would be and all , " says Marguerite Williamson , an actress who lives in Marietta , " and he said , ' Oh , it 'll be at the church ... I do n't know if they 'll allow liquor . I want my friends to have a drink on me . ' <p> " I said I 'd probably have them over to the house afterward , but then I said , ' Why wait till you 're dead to have this get-together ? Why not have a living wake and come to your own party ? ' " <p> So a week after their return in January 2003 , family , friends and colleagues gathered at the Williamsons ' home to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches : celebrating the lives of the dying while they are still around to appreciate it . <p> " We 've seen a trend in churches to celebrate a life as opposed to a sorrowful account of the loss , " says Jack LoCicero of Winston-Salem , N.C. , president of the Association for Death Education and Counseling . " This takes it one step further . We 're now seeing a trend of people developing their own celebrations before they die and not leaving it to chance . They 're doing it by choice and taking control of it . " <p> The association is composed of psychologists , physicians , clergy , researchers , educators and funeral directors dedicated to thanatology , the study of death , dying and bereavement . <p> George Watkins , a director and the owner of Synergy Films in Atlanta , remembers Williamson 's farewell vividly . <p> " It was a festive occasion , " says Watkins . " There was food and drink , and the party moved from the dining room to the patio to the sun porch . Everyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wonderful feeling of mutual support . It was a beautiful afternoon , and it felt as if you were going to a birthday party . <p> " And Gary was absolutely into it . He was cogent and cognitive and with it . He was very much trying to make people comfortable with a chuckle , a smile , a pat on the back . He was very interactive . He was in the moment , and he was celebrating with us . " <p> At a certain point , the party moved into the kitchen , leaving the sun porch to Williamson and guests who took turns visiting privately with him to make their farewells . <p> " It was n't awkward because it was just you and him , " Watkins says . " It was saying goodbye with as much sincerity and love as you could and appreciating that you were able to do this . It was very beautiful and meaningful , and I was thinking to myself what a wonderful thing , to have a celebration of your life at the end . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Americans have never been at ease with the idea of dying , says LoCicero , but attitudes began to change in the 1970s when Elisabeth Kubler-Ross wrote several books about it . However , when cremation became popular about 20 years ago , LoCicero says , " there were no memorials , no rituals to say goodbye , and we saw a lot of unresolved grief . " <p> End-of-life celebrations and the increasing popularity of hospice care are changing that , he says . <p> Jon Radulovic , vice president of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization in Alexandria , Va. , says that one of the central elements in hospice care is to encourage the dying to celebrate special events . <p> " Sometimes people nearing the end of their lives hold out for an event like the birth of a grandchild or a wedding , " Radulovic says . " Hospice helps them mark those events because it 's what 's going on in life . " <p> But many families , he says , are afraid to talk about death . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Radulovic says . " And it 's important for families to talk openly about the death of a loved one , because a lot of times others assume they know how they feel or what they 're thinking or what they would like their legacy to be . But sometimes that 's not the case . " <p> Radulovic says people used to think it " creepy " when a dying person renewed his or her wedding vows . " But now , people are more understanding . Now they say , ' That 's a cool idea . That 's really worth the family taking trouble to celebrate . ' " <p> A dying man in Tennessee , an ardent football fan , recently turned his final Super Bowl party into an end-of-life celebration . <p> " He was very open that it would be his last one , " Radulovic says . " It was a chance to say goodbye doing something he loved . " <p> Marjy Stagmeier , an Atlanta commercial Realtor , had a similar experience in the summer of 2004 when she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noack , a businessman who was her client and mentor . <p> " He had throat cancer , and his wife , Inge , got Lou Gehrig 's disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and they both were dying , " Stagmeier says . " They decided to have a huge party and invited 250 friends from all over the world . <p> " They rented a castle outside Frankfurt , and there was music and a photographer , and they videotaped it . People told stories and gave speeches about their lives , and it was like a wedding . It was a big production , and it was a lot of fun . And you could see that it was very , very meaningful to them . They were very touched by it . " <p> LoCicero says these celebrations are often an attempt to find meaning and reassurance . " Sometimes people get caught up in the emotion of it . They realize ' expletive , I 'm gon na die ! ' and all the stuff involved when you know it 's going to end . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no control over : ' This is what made life important . This is what was good , what made me get up every morning . ' It 's not looking just to go to heaven . It allows people to stop and say , ' Here 's why . ' It does n't mean it was perfect , but even with the imperfections , it was worth doing . " <p> In fact , LoCicero says , these 11th-hour reckonings can be fun . <p> " It 's taking some of the stuffiness out of death , " he says . " We 're always worried about what 's proper and appropriate . This lets you get to the other side of that and really celebrate the essence of that person . It 's a celebration by design , not by default . The fun you can have putting it together is , itself , worth it . " <p> And just as the survivors of those who have hospice care tend to grieve less , LoCicero believes that survivors who attend end-of-life celebrations also " have a lower rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months after the spectacular party in Frankfurt ; her husband lived more than a year before succumbing . " I saw him three times after that , " says Stagmeier , " and I think after the party he was n't afraid of death . There was so much love and support . " <p> She adds , " I 'm glad I got a chance to say goodbye . It was definitely a positive experience , and I felt closer to them for it . If I had a terminal disease , I would definitely have a big party . " <p> Gary Williamson died two weeks after his party , and Marguerite says it was one of the best things she 's ever done . <p> " It was great , " she says . " There were a lot of tears  --  the men were a real mess  --  but I got everyone to write something in a book , and after they left , Gary really enjoyed reading it . He was totally blown away by the whole thing . He could n't believe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have your friends and co-workers come over and face you and tell you what they thought of you , and what you meant to them . . . and to be able to prepare and say goodbye . . . would n't everybody like that ? I would love it if someone would do that for me . " Photo : CHRIS HUNT / StaffPhoto illustration of a toast being made with two glasses of wine. /ImageData*
