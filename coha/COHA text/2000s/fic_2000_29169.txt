Flints First Principle I first met Stanley Flint in the winter of 1980 , when I was nineteen.He was between editorial greatnesses then , just fired by the famousmagazine but not yet hired by the famous publisher . To earn his keephe traveled from university to university , offering his famousSeminar on the Writing of Fiction , which took place one night a weekand lasted for four hours . Wild rumors circulated about this seminar.It was said that at the beginning of the term he made his studentswrite down their deepest , darkest , dirtiest secrets and then readthem aloud one by one . It was said that he asked if they would bewilling to give up a limb in order to write a line as good as theopening of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . It was said thathe carried a pistol and shot it off every time a student read what heconsidered to be a formidable sentence . As the former fiction editor of Broadway magazine , Flint wasalready notorious in those days , though his notoriety was of an oddlysecondary variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , the first stories of some writers who had gone on tobecome great so great , in fact , that their blazing aureoles shonebackwards , as it were , illuminating the face of Flint the Discoverer , Flint the Seer , who had had the acumen not only to recognize geniusin its rawest form , but to pluck it from the heap , nurture it , refineit . Soon he had such a reputation that it was claimed he needed onlyto make a phone call and a writer would have a publishing contract , just like that until the editor in chief of Broadway , either fromjealousy orbecause Flint had had an affair with his secretary ( itdepended who you asked ) , fired him . Much media uproar followed but nojob offers , and Flint went to work as a teacher , in which role hecultivated an aura of mystic authority ; for instance , he was supposedto have gotten one of his students a six-figure advance on the basisof a single paragraph , which was probably the real reason why threehundred people had applied for the fifteen places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which that seminar took place.Located just off the informal library of one of the dormitories , itwas oblong and narrow , with wheezing radiators and shelves full ofbooks too obscure or valueless even to bother cataloguing . On thechalkboard left over from an Italian class that had met earlier inthe day the conjugation of the verb mangiare was written in a tidyhand . Because I had arrived twenty minutes early the first evening , only one other person was seated at the battered oak table , a girlwith circular glasses and tight blond braids , her attentionscowlingly focused on some German worksheets . Not wanting to appearidle in the presence of such industry , I busied myself arranging mycoat and scarves over the back of a chair ( it was January ) , then , pulling a book at random from one of the shelves , sat down andstarted to read it . The book was called Dawn to Sunset , and it hadbeen published in 1904 . On the title page its author had written thefollowing inscription : Con molto affetto , from one who spent hisformative years neath thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Florence ! the first chapter began.Flinging open the curtains , Dick Dandridge stared wonderingly at thepiazza in morning light . Such a buzz of activity ! It was market day , and at little stalls old women in black dresses were selling applesand potatoes . Two horses with caps on their ears pulled a wine cartpast the picturesque medieval church . Italy , Dick thought , remembering , for a moment , his mother weeping as his ship set sailfrom New York , and then his adventures in London , in Paris , at thecustoms house in Chiasso . He could not wait to get out into it , andpulling his nightshirt over his head , he called out to his friendThornley , Get up , slug-a-bed ! Weve Florence to see ! A Hispanic girl with bangs and acne on her forehead now camein and took a seat ; then a pair of boys , in avid conversation ; then aboy with a withered arm whom I recognized from a class on modernpoetry the semester before . We saluted each other vaguely . The girlwith the braids and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the voices of Dick Dandridge andhis friend Thornley , one of the pair of boys said , I wasnt on thelist , but Im hoping hell let me in anyway . ( At this last remark Ismiled privately . Though only a sophomore , I was on the list . ) Theboy who had said this , I observed , was handsome , older than I , withwire-rimmed spectacles and a two-days growth of beard ; it pleased meto think that Stanley Flint had preferred my submission to his . Andmeanwhile every seat but one had been taken ; students were sitting onthe floor , sitting on their backpacks , leaning against the shelves . Then Stanley Flint himself strode through the door , and allconversation ceased . There was no mistaking him . Tall and limping , with wild dark hair and a careful , gray-edged beard , he carried awhiff of New York into the room , a scent of steam rising throughsubway grates which made me shudder with longing . Bearing a wine-colored leather briefcase with brass locks , dressed in a gray suit , striped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , he took offand flung dramatically over the back of his chair , he seemed theembodiment of all things remote and glamorous , an urban adulthood towhich I aspired but had not the slightest idea how to reach . Even hispolished cane , even his limp like everything about Flint , itsorigins were a source of speculation and wild stories spoke to meof worldliness and glamour and the illicit . He did not greet us . Instead , opening his briefcase , he tookout a yellow legal pad , a red pencil , and a copy of the list ofstudents he had accepted for the seminar . Which one of you isLopez ? he asked , scanning the list . You ? ( He was looking at thegirl with bangs and bad skin . ) No , Im Joyce Mittman , the girl said . Then you must be Lopez . ( This time he addressed herneighbor , another Hispanic girl , her hair cut short like a swimmers . ) No , Im Acosta , the neighbor said . A low murmur of laughter now circulated one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he settled hisgaze on a tall , elegant young woman in a cowl-neck sweater who wasstanding in the corner . She was the only other Hispanic in the room . Then you must be Lopez , he said triumphantly . The girl did not smile . Did you get my note ? she asked . Did you bring the story ? he answered . She nodded . Over here , over here . Flint tapped the table . Extracting some pages from her backpack , Lopez walked to thefront of the room and handed them over . Flint put on a pair oftortoiseshell half-glasses . He read . After less than half a minute , he put the pages down . No , no , Im sorry , he said , giving them back to her . Thisis crap . You will never be a writer . Please leave . But youve only Please leave . Lopez wheezed . A sort of rictus seemed to have seized her and not only her , but me , the other students , the room itself . In thehigh tension of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forFlint , who scribbled blithely on his legal pad . Is something wrong ? he asked . The question broke the spell , unpalsied poor Lopez , whostuffed the crumpled pages into her backpack and made for the door , slamming it behind her as she went . In case you were wondering what happened , Flint said , continuing to scribble , Miss Lopez sent me a note requesting that Ilook at her story tonight , as she had missed the submission deadline.I agreed to do so . Unfortunately I did not think the story to beworthy . Gazing up from his pad , he counted with his indexfinger . And now I see that there are twenty twenty-two people inthis room . As I recall I selected only fifteen students for theclass . I would appreciate it if those of you whose names were not onthe list would please leave now , quietly , and without creating aspectacle of the sort that we have just witnessed from Miss Lopez . Several people bolted . Again Flint counted . Nineteen of usremained . I should tell you now , Flint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were shit , though those written by the fifteenof you whom I selected at least showed conviction a wisp of truthhere or there . As for the rest , you are courageous to have stuck itout , Ill give you that , and as courage is the one virtue everyfiction writer must possess in spades , I shall let you stay thatis , if you still feel inclined after I tell you what I expect of you . Then he stood and began to speak . He spoke for two hours . So began life with Stanley Flint . Im sorry to say I dontremember much of what he said that evening , though I do retain ageneral impression of being stirred , even awed ; he was a marvelousraconteur , and could keep us rapt all evening with his monologues , which often ranged far afield from the topic at hand . Indeed , today Iregret that unlike the girl with the braids her name , I soonlearned , was Baylor I never took notes during class . Otherwise Idhave before me a detailed record of what Flint had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vague effulgence out ofthe haze of which an aphorism occasionally emerges , fresh and entire.For instance : The greatest sin you can commit as a writer is to putyourself in a position of moral superiority to your characters . ( Though I have never ceased to trumpet this rule , I have often brokenit . ) Or : People forgive genius everything except success.Or : Remember that when you ask someone to read a story youvewritten , youre asking that person to give you a piece of his life.Minutes hours of his life . ( The gist of this idea was expressedby Flints first principle , of which Flints first principle wasexemplary : Get on with it ! ) It was all a great change from the only other writing classId ever taken , a summer poetry workshop sponsored by the Seattlejunior college a remnant of sixties idealism , all pine trees andoctagons where my mother had once gone to hear lectures on Proust.Of this workshop ( the word in itself is revealing ) I was the onlymale member . Our teacher , a young woman whose watery blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mildewyperfume of group therapy , at once confessional and pious . Often classwas held outdoors , on a lawn spattered with pine needles , which isperhaps why my memory has subsequently condensed that entire seriesof afternoons into the singular image of one of my classmates , aheavy girl with red spectacle-welts on her nose , standing before usin the sunlight and reading a poem of which only one line theyellow flows from me , a river remains , the words themselves flowingfrom her sad mouth in a repetitive drone , like a river without sourceor end . Flints seminar , to say the least , had a different rhythm . Itworked like this : at the beginning of each session a student would beasked to read aloud from his or her work . The student would then readone sentence . If Flint liked the sentence , the student would beallowed to continue ; if he did not , however and this was much morecommon the student would be cut off , shut up , sent to the corner . Atorrent of eloquence would follow , the ineffectuality of this slightundergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about anything at all . His most common complaint wasthat the sentence amounted to baby talk or throat-clearing thislatter accusation almost invariably followed by theinvocation Remember Flints first principle ! and from us , theresponsorial chant , Get on with it ! Soon we understood that Flint loathed boyfriend stories , stories in which the protagonist was a writer , stories set inrestaurants or cocktail lounges . To cocktail lounges he showed aparticular aversion : any story set in a cocktail lounge would provokefrom him a wail of lamentation , delivered in a voice both stentorianand grave , a sermon-izers voice , for the truth was , there wassomething deeply ministerial about Flint . Meanwhile the student whosetimid words had provoked this outpouring would have no choice but tosit and percolate , humiliated , occasionally letting out little gaspsof self-defense , which Flint would immediately quash . An atmosphereof hyperventilation ensued . The windows steamed . Those Flint hadmaligned stared at him , choking on the sentences in which , a momentearlier , they had taken such pride , and which he was now shoving backdown their throats . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even morerarely , when he allowed a student to move from the first sentence tothe second , or from the second to the third it was as if a windowhad been thrown open , admitting a breath of air into the churninghumidity of that room , and yet a breath that would cool the face ofthe chosen student only , bathing him or her in the delightful breezeof laudation , while outside its influence the rest of us sweltered , wiping our noses , mopping our brows . Sometimes he even let hisfavorites of whom Baylor , the girl with the braids , soon became theexemplar read a story all the way to the end . On these occasionsthe extravagance of Flints praise more than matched the barbarity ofhis deprecation . Not content merely to pay homage , he would seemactually to bow down before the author , assuming the humble postureof a supplicant . Im honored , hed say , Im moved , while thestudent in question glanced away , embarrassed . We all knew that hisadulation , at such moments , was over the top a reflection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or else part of a strategyintended to make us feel as if his approval were something on whichour very lives depended . Still , he was nothing if not consistent . Whether deliveringtirade or paean , he never wavered from his literary ethos , at thecore of which lay the belief that all human experiences , no matterhow different they might seem on the surface , shared a commongrounding . This theme ( Flints second principle ) he trumpeted atevery opportunity . To perceive something one had gone through asparticular or special , he kept telling us , was to commit not merelyan error , but a sin against art . On the other hand , by admitting thecommonality that binds us all , not only might we win from readers theprecious tremor of empathy that precedes faith , we might also near , as we could from no other direction , that mercurial yet unwaveringgoal : the truth . In retrospect , I wonder at my ability not only to survive , but to thrive under such circumstances . Twenty years later Im moresensitive rather than less , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth enduring . I feel sympathetictoward poor Lopez in a way that I did nt then . Also , so many peoplehave studied with Flint since 1980 that by now his detractors faroutnumber his supporters , among whom with some reservations Icount myself . According to these detractors , Flint was nothing but abully , a petty dictator , his classes the ritual induction ceremoniesof the cult over which he presided , like a fat little demigod . Forwhat , after all , was this alternation of upbraiding with intemperatehomage that he practiced , if not the very essence of brainwashing ? Yes , to his detractors Flint would never be more than a mountebank , aliterary equivalent of Werner Erhard , the self-help guru who in thelate seventies stripped his would-be disciples of their wristwatchesand forbade them to go to the bathroom . Nor can I deny the legitimacyof their complaints , for he did all the things of which they accusehim . And yet how else to say it ? he was great . And if greatness , these days , arouses suspicion , if not outright hostility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women arerarely nice , and often capricious ; or because something in the verynature of democracy chafes at the idea of too much greatness residingwithin a single human frame , instead of being placed at the center ofthe arena to be fought over ; or because greatness demands of us thatwe reconsider , and possibly revise , the very terms according to whichwe define our humanity a task from which mediocrity , by its verynature , cowers . His detractors are right to describe Stanley Flint asthe leader of a cult . They are wrong in assuming that it was a cultof personality . If Flint was a missionary , then literature was hisdeity . Youll never meet anyone who takes writing more seriouslythan I do , he told me once . He was right . I never have . Of himself , on the other hand , I am convinced that he thought verylittle . This became more and more obvious as the semester proceeded.The third week , for instance , he arrived in class red-faced andwinded , wearing black boots and a Heathcliffish cape . Children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have aspecial treat for you tonight , then went on to explain that he hadjust received some pages from the novel on which Leonard Trask thegreat writer he had discovered a decade ago , when Trask was still amineworker in Montana had been at work for the past ten years . Andthese pages , for our delight as well as our edification , he was nowgoing to read aloud to us , a rare privilege , as even Traskspublisher had not yet seen them . I remember wondering , that night , at Flints cape . Certainlyit contributed to the element of theatricality that underlay hisperformance , a quality of spectacle with which Flint invested all hisreadings , but particularly those of the writers he had discovered , orwhose work he revered . Diction precise , voice rapturous , he offeredus Trasks finely tuned sentences as if each were a delicacy , a sliceof white truffle , or a toast point spread with caviar . Indeed , sosumptuous was his delivery that today I recall nothing of the readingitself . Instead it is only the voice of the caped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eclipseeverything around it : our faces , the snow outside the window , eventhe **25;235;TOOLONG that had occasioned it . Another recollection : one particularly cold , blizzardy night , Flint brought in a copy of some literary quarterly I forget whichone and thrust it in front of our faces . Do you know thismagazine ? he asked , pointing at the matte white cover , which wasalready smudged with fingerprint-shaped patches of New York Times ink . We did not . Im going to read you a story Ive had occasion to see hererecently , Flint went on , because I want to know , honestly , what youthink of it . And he began to read . One sentence , two sentences . Hestopped . No , no , he said , shaking his head . All wrong . No life.Take this as a lesson , children . The language is being mangled , notcaressed . And this sort of thing appears all the time in our betterliterary journals . We stayed silent . Clearing his throat , he read anothersentence and stopped again . You see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has failed to captivate . It has failed to seduce . Iwrote this , he added casually , slipping the magazine back into hisbriefcase as a rattle of surprise passed through the room . For upuntil that moment , we had not known that Flint himself was a writer . The next morning , I looked up his name in the periodicalsindex at the library . It turned out that he had published a dozenstories over the past decade , all of them in obscure journals withtiny print runs , none in the great organs of culture in which thework of his disciples regularly appeared . Of the stories themselves all of which I dug out and read I remember few details . Most ofthem were not even stories so much as brief bits of language torture , congested , constipated even , and redolent of some long and futilelabor as if the sentences had been subjected to such anguishedrevision , worked over so many times , that they had finally expiredfrom the effort . Then , for the first time , I felt that I understoodStanley Flint . Far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose dry and reaching lips that flow ofeloquence , a single taste of which would have satiated him , foreverbent away . Yes , his was the cruel position of the high priest whofinds himself envying the very God it is his sacred duty tocultivate ; and yet who can say whether this envy is not itselfintended to be the ultimate test of his faith ? Although in memory those hours I spent under Flints tutelage havenow bloated to the point that they seem to obliterate everything elseI did and thought that semester , the truth is that every day exceptWednesday ( when the seminar met ) I was leading the typicallydesultory life of the undergraduate , in which Flint played no part ; that is to say , I went to class , I studied , I brooded over futilecrushes , I ate my dinners and breakfasts in the dining hall , I hadfriends . Never in my life have I had so many friends . Lately Ivecome to believe that the process of growing older is essentially oneof ruthless and continual editing , so that the novel of onesexperience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages out of sequence will by forty have resolveditself into a fairly conventional tale of provincial life , and bysixty be reduced to one of those incisive , minimalist works inwhich irony and wordplay displace plot ( a word I put in quotationmarks because Flint loathed it ) . Thus at thirty-eight I travel in acomparatively restricted circle . At nineteen , on the other hand , Ihad dozens of friends , and more than that , I looked upon every one ofthem as a potential intimate . Occasionally , during those abundant days , I would run into myclassmates from Flints seminar . Mittman was one of the servers in mydining hall shed barely nod at me as she spooned eggs Florentine ( hard-boiled eggs with spinach , and not Florentine at all ) onto myplate . Baylor and I were taking the same big lecture course on theart of the Italian Renaissance . We used to encounter each other inthe dimly lit gallery wherein were hung reproductions of thepaintings and sculptures the titles and locations of which we weresupposed to memorize for our midterm . In the gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were members ofone of the secret societies that flourished on the campus . Once , at an informational meeting about an internship at aNew York publishing house for which I wanted to apply , I even raninto Lopez . Legs crossed , dressed as before in a sleek cowl-necksweater , she sat across the table from me and took notes , her face astudy of elegant composure . Yet when I smiled at her , she turnedaway , refusing so much as to meet my glance . Still , despite all this activity , Wednesday nights remainedthe epicenter of my life that semester , the black hole into which allthe other days and nights collapsed . In part this was due to anxiety.The term was nearly half over , and I still had nt managed to get pastthe first sentence with Flint . Bauman , Bauman , Bauman , hed wailwhenever I started to read , and cover his head with his hands . Itseemed I was making the same mistake over and over : I kept trying towrite about my mother , who was at that time undergoing radiationtherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everysentence had to do with lumps : Feel my lumps , my mother says to myfather is one example . Youre playing for sympathy , Flint would tell me whenever Iread these sentences . You want us to feel sorry for you . See ? Wedont . Finally I decided to change my tactics . Id recently read anarticle about a couple called Bo and Peep , who would later become thefounders of the notorious Heavens Gate cult . At the time , however , they were just another pair of late-seventies lunatics , wanderingthrough the Midwest and soliciting disciples to go with them to somespot in the desert where a spaceship was supposed to pick them up . Intheir rather pathetic ( and surprisingly successful ) efforts to enlistfollowers , I sensed the possibility of a story , the heroine of whichwould be my oldest aunt , Lily , who shocks her family by deciding torun off with Bo and Peep , whom I renamed FeeFi and FoFum . Lily , already in her eighties by this time , and living in a Floridaretirement community , I called Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday I hoped Flint wouldnt call on me . I didntthink I was ready yet . Also , I had a good feeling about the story andwanted to wait until it was finished before I shared it . As it turnedout , however , I had nothing to worry about , for when Flint stormedinto class late , for the first time all semester , and clutching amass of documents in his fist it was obvious that somethingmomentous ( and probablyterrible ) had occurred . Im sorry to have kept you waiting , hesaid , throwing off his coat . I do nt know if youve heard whatshappened . . . We said nothing . Clearly no one had . Children , I arrived this evening on the campus of your greatuniversity , full of beans , eager to see every one of you , hecontinued . Little did I imagine that upon stepping into my office Iwould be confronted with this he indicated the documents asituation the likes of which , in my wildest dreams , I could neverhave imagined . Im deeply bereaved . Im also outraged . Especiallyafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marvelousstory . . . Again , silence . Sitting down , he thrust a heavy hand throughhis dark hair . And to think that just a few hours ago . . . And nowthis horror , this sickening slander . . . What happened ? Mittman asked meekly . It turned out that Lopez the same Lopez whose work he hadso efficiently decimated the first night of class , and whom I hadonly a few days ago encountered at the internship meeting hadlodged a formal complaint against him , of which he had been apprisedonly that evening . Her affidavit , phrased in the acid , impersonallanguage of lawsuits , he now read aloud , holding it away from hisface as if it were literally noxious . My impression was that morethan anything else , the writing itself wounded him , for what was thisaffidavit but that story that most offended his delicatesensibilities , the story that lied , thatput itself in a position of moral superiority to its characters , thatfailed to recognize the commonality of the human condition : in short , the very story Lopez had handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself obliged bullied , even to read through tothe end ? Alas , the bullying worked . For the moment , at least , Lopeztriumphed . According to her affidavit , Flint had glanced first atMitt-man , then at Acosta , then at her , and said , You wetbacks alllook alike to me . A gross libel ! he shouted now , throwing down the pages . Inever said such a thing ! Mittman affirmed that he had not . Acostaseconded . How can literature survive in such an atmosphere ? Ah , children , how numerous are the enemies of the imagination and inwhat guises of piety they clothe themselves ! The literal is never thetruth . Take this down . The literal blinds us . The facts do not speak . He wiped his eyes . He looked this man who craved only thepurest water as if he had just been forced to swallow a gallon ofbile . To make such an accusation against me me , of all people , hewent on , I , who have always been the greatest advocate of tolerance , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prayyou shall never know ! Anyone could tell you that . I was in Selma , forGods sake . I was arrested in Selma . The record proves it . Ipublished the first story by a black woman ever to appear inBroadway , and it was a hell of a struggle to get it through . And thatwoman was Nancy Coleridge . She was on welfare . In Cincinnati , onwelfare . And now look at her they say she may get the Nobel Prize , for Christs sake ! This complaint of Miss Lopezs , this is not acrime against me personally , this is not about me personally , this isa crime against art . For what has she done but use language ourmost precious asset to level a blow at freedom ? Someone lit a cigarette . The boy with the spectacles offeredto fetch Flint a cocktail from his room . He refused . Needless to say , no one read that night . Instead Flinttalked . He talked and talked . First he said he was going to resign.Then he swore he would never again set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to reconsider . We offered to writeletters , to start a petition . He kept shaking his head . I think herather enjoyed being the object of our entreaties . Finally he thankedand dismissed us , promising to mull the situation over before making a final decision . For the first and last time all term , the seminarlet out early . The process by which all of this was resolved of which Ilearned the details only several months later was as follows : afterclass that evening , Mittman and Acosta paid an unannounced visit toLopez in her dormitory , dismissing her roommate peremptorily . Behindlocked doors , the three of them then spoke heatedly for severalhours , emerging , according to a witness , only around sunrise , arm inarm , tears in their eyes : a photo op for sisterhood . That morning , accompanied by her new friends , Lopez officially withdrew hercomplaint against Stanley Flint . The next week he was back , as volatile and jubilant as ever.No allusion was made to the black events of the previous Wednesday.For several sessions he oscillated in his usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labored privatelyat my story about Aunt Lily . Progress was slow ; by spring break Istill had nt finished . Instead of going home to California I decided to stay on campus , where every afternoon I holed up in the rearsmoking section of the undergraduate library . Most of my companionsthere were lesbians , some with rings in their noses , all followers ofone or another of the fashionable theorists of the moment , and atwork on long essays or theses . To my left Gretchen , adeconstructionist , wrote about Jane Austen ; to my right Schuyler , aLacanian feminist , toiled away on Melanie Klein . I ground out mystory . Spring break ended . Classmates I did nt like returned , bronzed and fit after vacations in Florida , while the lesbians , theirskin library-pallid , smoked and wrote and ignored them . I finished mystory , then stayed up most of Tuesday night typing , so that I couldbring it to class the next evening . It was now April the sort of April we see less and lessthese days , during which winter , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as spring tries over and over again to evicther . No sooner would tiny buds have appeared on the trees than abiting wind would have whipped up , shriveling these nubs of lifebefore they could flower . Or Id be sunning one day with my friendson the lawn in front of the library , when suddenly rain would startto fall , and within a few hours a blizzard would blanket the freshgrass with snow . A perpetual sludge of muddy ice made the flagstonestreacherous . The night I read aloud for the seminar , because I had onthe wrong shoes , I slipped on the way , tearing a hole in the knee ofmy jeans . My eastern classmates , all of whom owned more appropriatefootwear , laughed at me when I entered the seminar room . Every signfor success seemed inauspicious . Then Flint limped into class with his briefcase , his smell ofsubways . Good to see you all again , he said gruffly , unwinding hislong cashmere scarf in a way that meant business . No preludes , noreading from newly received galleys . Well , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right , Bauman . Wow us . He sat back . Baylor crossed her arms and stared at me . Aunt Bessie was thirty when my father was born , Iread , the first son at last after nine daughters . I paused , taking it for granted , after so many failedefforts , that Flint would now interrupt me , shake his head , mutter , Bauman , Bauman , Bauman . Instead he said , Go on . I looked up . My heart began to race . His birth was a relief to my grandparents , I read , whocould finally stop conceiving . He smiled . Go on . I went on . I read the entire story all thirty-five pages.It took almost an hour . By the time Id finished rain had startedoutside , and Flint was still smiling . Whod have ever thought , he said , that something like thiswould come from Bauman ? I think I almost fainted . It was as if , with a singlegesture , Flint had swept away winter . Suddenly I danced in a springglade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caughtnothing of their meaning . Instead ( as I am told is the case withdogs ) it was the cadences of his approval , the intonations of hispraise , that warmed and restored me . From that evening on , I was his favorite ; and not merely afavorite , but the favorite among favorites . Like the snow itself , myanxiety melted and was gone . It was as if , having written such astory , Idbeen absolved ( at least by myself ) of that necessity to win Flintover that had driven me since the beginning of the term . Freed frompressure , I came to class laughing , and always took the seat directly to his left . Now , I think , is the moment to make certain confessionsregarding my character , then and now . For all my awkwardness as ayoung man , my timidity , that tendency to feel ill at ease amongstrangers which had made me so shy the first night of Flintsseminar , I was ( and am ) both ambitious and competitive . What Icraved , more than anything else , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be synonymous with approval . The origins of thismisapprehension I shall explore in greater detail later on . Sufficeit to say , for now , that as early as my freshman year , I had areputation among my peers for being both arrogant and opportunistic:a reputation , moreover , which , though the natural result of my loudand occasionally obnoxious comportment , could not have been more atodds with the image that I cultivated of myself , as sincere , generous , and above all guileless . I did nt recognize , in otherwords , the degree to which my desire to please dictated not only myconduct , but the very approach I took to writing , which even then Iconsidered my mtier . Thus you may recall that earlier , whendescribing the process by which I came to write the story with whichI eventually won Stanley Flints heart , I said , without even beingconscious of it , that at a certain point I decided to change mytactics . Tactics , more than I care to admit today , dictated mydecision to write that particular story . Above all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolting example of the teachers pet . I must have been unbearable . For instance , a few weeks aftermy triumph with Flint , I was reading aloud from a new story , aslapdash thing that I considered to be extremely funny so funnythat halfway through I broke into a fit of debilitatinglaughter . Im sorry , I spluttered , putting down my pages . No one else was laughing . Its all right , Flint saidcoolly . I always enjoy the spectacle of a writer amusing himself . ( It is a testament to my denseness that I took this remark as acompliment . ) Shortly after this episode he assigned us one of his rare in-class exercises : each of us was to write a one-sentence description of someone else in the room , then read it aloud , after which the restof us would try to guess who it was that was being described . I haveno memory of what I wrote myself that night . What I do recall is thatMittman described a very beautiful girl named Thompson ( with Flint wewere all on a last-name basis ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles , when his turn came , described someone asbeing ready to pounce on a sure thing . At first I couldnt imagineto whom he was referring , until Baylor said , Thats Bauman . Amurmur of concurrence followed . Bauman , the choristers repeated.And Flint agreed : No doubt about it . Bauman . Ready to pounce on a sure thing . When I was a child the boysat my bus stop used to call out Faggot ! as I approached in themorning with my lunch box . Just as they intuited from my behavior in particular , from the ways I interacted with them a facet of myidentity of which I myself was still unconscious , so the boy with thespectacles , with that uncanny prescience of peers , had detected astrain of ruthlessness in my character that would later blossom intofanatical professionalism , but remained for the moment , as it were , latent , unbudded . For I had a lot invested , in those years , in anidea of myself as innocent and goodhearted ; nor was I far off themark , since the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goodheartedness ; specifically , theinnocent , goodhearted craving of the child for adult approval . The boy with the spectacles attracted and scared me . Imsorry to say that today I do nt remember his name , even though Ioften thought about him then , in particular about the way his chesthair the color of champagne seemed literally to bubble out of thecollar of his sweater . A few years later I ran into him in New York , and he told me almost boastfully that after class that first nightFlint had approached him to find out where on campus he might go toget some pussy . That was the word he used : pussy . Ourconversation left me with the impression that between him and Flintthere had developed one of those buddyish intimacies to which thejoint pursuit of women lends an erotic edge . I pictured them prowlingthe campus like male dogs who have picked up the scent of a female inheat , an image the contemplation of which left me feelingemasculated , excluded , and faintly aroused . I suppose now that I was a little in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good-looking man , lean and surly , with hands like broken-in leather gloves . Nor did his reputation as awomanizer in any way detract from the effect he had on me . On thecontrary , it served only to intensify my idea of him as an avatar ofmasculine virility . For what I wanted from Flint , I told myself , wasnt so much sex as permission to write , to think of myself as awriter . Today I recognize the degree to which this need for hisapprobation encoded a desire I had heretofore never admitted : thedesire for men and more specifically , for older , fatherly men whodidnt desire me . ( About this desire I felt a sense of shame thatpersisted even after I had come out , leading me to pretend that I wasattracted to nice boys my own age , instead of the burly men intheir thirties and forties who figured in my daydreams . ) A long timelater , when I was living with Eli Aronson , and having always to comeup with new sexual fantasies by means of which I could maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I startedfor the first time to have explicitly sexual thoughts about my formerteacher . Giving Eli a blowjob in his loft on Elizabeth Street , Idfind myself back to my college dorm room . It would be late at night Wednesday night and someone would be knocking at the door . Idanswer . Bauman , Bauman , Flint would say , Im desperate . I cantfind any pussy . And I would invite him in , sit him down on the bed ( he would require help with his bad leg ) , undo his pants , and takehis penis long , I imagined , and not terribly hard , though ruddy into my mouth . . . What was exciting to me about this fantasy ( and what made itone of the ones , in those years , on which I could count even when allelse failed to carry me through the bouts of fretful lovemaking onwhich Eli and I so perversely staked our happiness ) was the fact thatin it , Flint showed no sexual interest whatsoever in me . Instead Iwas only a last-ditch alternative , a cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feminine receptivity to whichthe boy with the spectacles had alluded when hed used theword pussy . Help me out , Bauman , Flint would say in this fantasy:never I want you or I love you . That would have spoiledeverything . Indeed , if someone had told me that Flint was secretlyhomosexual , or that he was in love with one of the boys in the class , I think I would have lost all respect ( not to mention desire ) forhim , instead of living , as I did , for the day when he might let mecall him mentor . As for his real life his life in New York I knew almostnothing . That he was married and had several children , one asophomore at my university , I had divined from casual references hedmade during class . The names of these children , however , he nevershared , just as he refused to give us ( or anyone ) his home addressand phone number . Like many great and neurotic men , he had apersecution complex , and feared lest some madman probably a writerwhose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and shoot him in his bed . Even murkier were the details of his early years . Forexample , though it was assumed from a certain lilt in his accent thathe was southern , no one I asked seemed to have any idea where exactlyhed grown up , where ( or whether ) hed gone to college . Baylor saidshed heard that Stanley Flint was not his real name , whileThompson , who had connections in the magazine world , claimed to haveit on authority that hed done time in prison . I wasnt sure whetherI believed any of this ; nor , if truth be told , did the details of hisyouth interest me nearly as much as the mystery of how he spent allthe days of the week that werent Wednesday , those days when hetarried in realms of sophistication to which , I felt certain , he washabituated , and which I longed to know . Unfortunately , about thesepoints he was equally unforthcoming not only , I suspect , because hewanted to protect his privacy , but because his enthusiasm for writingitself rendered all other aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus he might casually mention having run into SusanSontag at a party , but only as a way of introducing some trenchantobservation about Sontags work an observation the most basicrudiments of which I would fail to take in , so awed was I by the veryidea of a party at which Susan Sontag would be a guest . Or he mighttell us that hed been at dinner with a young writer named LizaPerlman , the daughter of the literary agent Sada Perlman , who seemedto represent all his favorites . Though only twenty , she had justpublished her first novel , Midnight Snacks . Look at this , Flintwould taunt , thrusting in our faces the books backside , from whichLizas benign , oddly asymmetrical face , framed by red hair , staredout . A junior in college , and already she has a book out . It makesyou jealous , does nt it ? But could you do better ? The fact was , I had no idea if I could do better . Indeed , sodazzled was I by Liza Perlmans public image ( and what was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image ? ) that I barelyregistered her reality as a human being with whom I might somedaycompete . Though later she would become an intimate fixture of mylife , Liza existed for me in those days less as a person than as asort of fleshly emanation of that city in which she had gone todinner with Stanley Flint , and in which I , too , hoped someday tolive ; indeed , had hoped to live ever since the summer my mother hadtaken my sister and me to spend two days at the St. Moritz Hotel , twodays during which we did only the usual tourist things shopped , andwent to Broadway shows , and ate lunch at Rumpelmayers , where awaitress , when I asked for more water , snapped , Youve had yourquota . And yet even this glimpse of New York had been enough toprovoke in me a hunger for the city that lasted the next twenty years . And another hundred people just got off of the train , Marta ( in the guise of my sister ) sang in a community theater production ofCompany to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herfrom the audience , I wanted to be one of those hundred people , foreven then the citys famed and pitiless indifference to new arrivalsappealed to me at least as much as the array of beguilements , sexualand cultural , with which it enticed movies and plays , lovers andrestaurants , that whole landscape of anonymous distraction throughwhich I saw myself wandering , not so much invisible as unrecognized , a hurtling atom in some charged and fluid field of possibility . That night I began nurturing a dream of the adulthood I wouldhave in New York , a dream in which I lived on a high floor of a newskyscraper , in a perfectly round apartment the entirety of which wastaken up by a circular mattress covered with pillows , and from thecushioned heights of which I might look out , each evening , at thebrilliant light show that somehow I possessed even as it possessedme , along with Stanley Flint and Liza Perlman and all its otherdenizens . Denizens , not citizens : already I was thinking of New Yorkas a place to which I was doomed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its ruined me for anyplace else , I used to tellpeople in those years when I really did live in a high-rise ( albeitnot in a round room ) , the years when I hardly stepped off the islandof Manhattan , and felt sorry for anyone who had the misfortune tolive anywhere else ( especially because the most vivid horror isalways that nearest to home in Brooklyn or Queens ) . I couldntimagine that a day would come when Id view the city as being atleast as narrow and provincial as that landscape of my adolescencewhich , like the protagonists of certain stories by Willa Cather , Idthrown over , thinking myself too good for it . And yet how could Ihave recognized this , when I insisted so stubbornly on endowing NewYork with the power to authorize my very selfhood ? One advantage of my university , for me , was its relativeproximity to the city , which was only an hour east by bus . AlreadyI went fairly often , usually with my roommate , Jim Sterling , whoseparents lived in a vast apartment on Central Park West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture:museums and movies , and on Saturday nights , the theater , usuallyserious plays , the latest works by Marsha Norman or David Hare , instead of the shows things like Cats and Evita to which mymother had taken my sister and me , and which I now disdained . Jimsambition was to write for the culture section of the New York Times , and so in the mornings , over Sunday brunch , he would amuse hisparents and me with disquisitions on whatever we had seen the nightbefore long monologues the thread of which I would gradually loseas I stared over the platter of bagels at Central Park , thinking about my own adolescence , how meager and colorless it seemed whencompared to Jims , which had been crowded with activity : visits tothe Temple of Dendur , and Radio City Music Hall , and the Museum ofNatural History . Not that I had grown up in Willa Cathers Nebraska ; indeed , our pleasant Seattle neighborhood was by any standard otherthan my own a utopia . I exaggerated horribly as if the future Ilonged for required as its prerequisite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I entered my story about Aunt Bessiein a fiction contest that had been initiated a decade earlier by afamous television reporter in memory of his son , who had died in amountain climbing accident . The story won the first time the prizehad ever been given to a sophomore . Not surprisingly , everyone elsein Flints seminar had entered the contest too . My classmates greetedme , when I arrived for our last meeting , with a sort of low snarl ofcongratulations : good wishes beneath which I could detect thedistinct and scary purr of feline rancor . The weather was unseasonably warm that May . Outside tulips , undeterred by the late snowstorms , bloomed with a fretful vigor . Theair through the open window of the seminar room smelled sweet , whileon the blackboard the subjunctive conjugation of the verb piacere last remnant of that Italian class on which I had eavesdroppedthrough the semester testified to the human capacity , mysteriousonly when you think about it , to learn . Even Flint , dressed in a pinkshirt and a jacket of greenish tweed , seemed to be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he saluted us . Indeed , so kind was his welcome that for the first time I wondered whetherthe savage aspect he had shown that first January night might havederived not from some streak of sadism in his character , not evenfrom an idea he had about teaching , but from simple shyness . I remember that in keeping with an old tradition at theschool , everyone had brought food or drink to this last class : bagsof potato chips and bottles of Coke and Sprite and plates of cookies , which we spread out over the seminar table like goods at a bake sale.Only Flint did not eat . Instead he talked . Children , children , heintoned , his plaintive voice betraying a nostalgia to which I wouldnot , at first , have thought him susceptible . How quickly things end.Its hard to imagine that only a few months have passed since ourfirst evening together . . . yet this is the nature of things . Youhave been a blessing to me , every one of you . Of course you shall allreceive As , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upon each of you . I wish I could give you more than As.But I cant only this little letter that may be of some use oneday , along with a few parting words , a last assessment , some adviceto take or ignore as you see fit . All sounds of consumption ceased . I think that what surprisedus wasnt so much this announcement itself as the fact that he wasplanning to give these final evaluations in class . Yet such , apparently , was his typically unorthodox plan , for now he began tomake his way around the table , from student to student , granting eachof us even those who , having never gotten past sentence one , hadgiven up trying an appraisal at once judicious and generous , aliberal dollop of that balm he had previously dispensed only in tinyquantities , on the rare occasions when one of us wrote something thatpleased him . As for me , I waited . Because teachers pet that I was Iwas seated immediately to his left , I knew I would be the last to beaddressed . My turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hischair toward mine and stretching out his legs . Bauman , Bauman , Bauman . What can we say about you ? You have won the prize . Silence . Was this meant as congratulations ? You have pulled the brass ring , and now you get to ride themerry-go-round again . In fact , I do nt doubt but that youll beriding the merry-go-round the rest of your life . ( Laughter . ) Atfirst I wasnt sure what to make of you . You seemed so eager , and soincompetent . ( More laughter . ) But then you got ahold of somethingand did nt let go . And Ive got to applaud you for it . Yourefearless . You know what you want . Thats why of all the people inthis room youre the only one I feel certain will make a success ofhimself as a writer . And yet . . . of course theres an and yet , isnt there ? ( Still more laughter . Flints smile disappeared . ) Ifear for you , Bauman . You are eminently corruptible . You can tell astory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do nt seem tocare about becoming serious . And once youre out there , in themarketplace . . . Im sorry to say it , but its easy for me toimagine you turning into a hack , settling for cheap success , and notbecause youre greedy , but because you desire too desperately toplease . All at once , to my shock , he took my hand . If you prove mewrong , Ill jump for joy . If you do nt , I ask you only to rememberthis voice . Remember that Ive never said a word to you out of self-interest , or told you only what you wanted to hear . The room went silent . Quietly Flint removed his glove-leatherhand from mine . And now , he said , turning away from me , I bid youall farewell . Stay in touch . As you know I do nt give out my homeaddress . Nonetheless you can always reach me care of the Englishdepartment here . The magnificent Mrs. Hall , the department secretary , has promised to forward everything along . Standing , he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ? Mittman asked . No , no , Flint answered sadly . I And shaking his head , he left . We were alone suddenly , with all that food , and in my case , a consciousness that I was being stared at not with envy , no longerwith envy but with pity . Pleading a final to study for , I fled . I went back to myroom , where I started packing : in just a few days I would be leavingfor New York , where Id begin that summer internship at thepublishing house for which I ( and not Lopez ) had been selected . Andyet I couldnt concentrate on my suitcases tonight . Instead , sittingat my desk , I pulled from the drawer the letter Id just receivedfrom the news reporter , congratulating me on my prize . Your story isboth delightful and professional , hed written , just as Flint hadsaid that of all the students in the class , I was the one most likelyto find success as a writer : words at the utterance of which acurrent of pride had surged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to revive , to re-feel in its original purity , before his subsequent admonishments had snuffed it out . Anyway , were Flints warnings fair ? Leaning back , I tried toanalyze my behavior over the course of the semester . All I had done , it seemed to me , was write a story he had liked , and win a prize ; yetnow he reproached me . . . and why ? People forgive talent everythingexcept success : Flint himself had told us that . Wasnt it possible , then , that in castigating me , he was merely illustrating his ownmaxim , giving voice he whose work had come to so little to anenvy not only of me , but of all of us , of all that earnest potential , so far unsullied by spite , that I and my classmates , in our eageryouth , personified ? That night , I committed the first of the many acts ofbetrayal that would punctuate the next twenty years of my life . Notthat I denounced Flint , or called up Lopez to tell her she had beenright all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the subtlestforms of defamation that prove , in the end , the most pernicious . ForLopezs campaign against Flint , at least , had had the advantage ofbeing up front and bold . My own , on the other hand , was underhanded , and consisted chiefly in telling the many people I met that summer inNew York that though , of course , Flint was a genius this wentwithout saying he was also a demagogue , petty and self-interested , and always trying to make his students dependent upon him , so thatwhen or if they became successful , he could claim credit for theirfame , and thus steal a portion of the recognition his own work hadnever earned him . ( Partly true which in no way absolves me of thecharge of defamation . Anyway , the truth was not my goal . My goal wasrevenge . ) The next afternoon I took the bus into New York , to havelunch with the young woman who had hired me for the summer internshipat Hudson House Publishers . It was raining . As the bus entered theHolland Tunnel I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from our school every Wednesday , no matter theweather . For you , my children , Id brave the fiercest storm , hedsaid once , in that voice to the timbre of which Id thrilled . . . Nomore . Already I was listening for other voices , ones which , because they belonged to a future that was for the moment fictive , a thing ofmy own imagining , I could make say whatever I wanted , like thestuffed animals that as a child I had imbued with personality . A joyto read , one said . And another said , the next J. D. Salinger . And thethird said ( I curse to remember it , I curse to repeat it ) , The truthand what you want to hear are the same .
