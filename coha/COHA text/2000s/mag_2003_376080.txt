In America , rich and poor , like partisan and bad driver , are terms we reserve for people besides ourselves . Ask a banker and a burger flipper , and they will both tell you that they 're middle-class . So it is too on TV . Once , prime time had populist fun with the differences between rich and poor Americans ( The Beverly Hillbillies , Good Times , Dallas ) . But by the late 1990s , both struggling workers and scheming , zillionaire J.R . types had become fewer , replaced by the characters in middle-class soaps ( Dawson 's Creek ) and the cappuccino-quaffing likes of Frasier , Friends and Will &; Grace ; we were one nation under Starbucks . <P> That was one recession and a few corporate scandals ago . Now , faster than you can say Ken Lay  --  and , more to the point , faster than the feds can indict him  --  prime time is again daring to suggest that there are classes in America . There are sitcoms with working-class leads and teen soaps and reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy folks cheating and stealing and being humiliated  --  no fewer than three new series have characters who are in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . And they said Martha Stewart 's influence on TV was over . <P> The network most solidly behind this trend is Fox , which strangely  --  for a TV network run by archconservative Rupert Murdoch  --  is as obsessed with the inequities of capital as Eugene V. Debs was . At least half a dozen of its new shows have class themes . The first to premiere , and the season 's first confirmed hit , is The O.C. Ryan Atwood ( Benjamin McKenzie ) is a smart , poor kid taken in by the Cohen family of Newport Beach , Calif. , after he gets in trouble with the law . Naturally , he finds beautiful girls , brutal rich boys and conniving adults . But The O.C. ( on hiatus for baseball season ; moves to Thursdays , 9 p.m . E.T. , beginning Oct. 30 ) is more complex than its root-of-all-evil premise in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety for everyone . The dirty secret in most rich-people soaps is corruption . In The O.C. , it 's insecurity  --  from the next-door neighbor , who has defrauded his investment clients to maintain his family 's lifestyle , to the Cohens ' charming but nerdy son Seth , who is proof that money does n't equal social acceptance . Creator Josh Schwartz says the show " was n't an attempt to cash in on the political zeitgeist , " but , he adds , " there is also a sense in the country right now that all is not what it seems . " <P> Teen soaps are a natural place to address class because teens know viscerally what adults learn to forget : that it does matter what your parents do , how much money your family has , where you come from . On the WB 's One Tree Hill ( Tuesdays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) two half brothers by the same father  --  one raised poor , one privileged  --  are rivals in their love lives and on the basketball court . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WB tradition , but TV has a harder time dealing with working-class adults . Fox 's Luis ( Fridays , 8:30 p.m . E.T. ) , starring Luis Guzman as a struggling doughnut-shop owner in Spanish Harlem , is a parade of urban stereotypes , while NBC 's midseason The Tracy Morgan Show ( with the Saturday Night Live vet as a garage owner of modest means ) is a cliched family-comedy dud .
