George Harrison 's death further eroded a group that entranced the world , not just with its musical genius but with its sense of camaraderie and fun , as TIME noted in a 1967 cover on THE BEATLES . <P> The Beatles keep in touch constantly , bounding in and out of each other 's homes like members of a single large family  --  which , in a sense , they are . Their friendship is an extraordinary intimate and empathetic bond . When all four are together , even close friends like Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones sense invisible barriers thrown up between themselves and outsiders . " We 're still our own best friends , " each says ... They constitute a four-way plug-in personality , each sparking the circuits in his own way . Paul , outgoing and talkative , spreads a sheen of charm ; he is the smoother-over , the explainer , as pleasingly facile at life as he is at composing melodies . George , once the least visible of the group , now focuses his energies on Indian music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the most accomplished instrumentalist . Ringo , a thoroughly unpretentious fellow , is also the most innately comic temperament ; he is the catalyst , and also the deflator , of the crew . Most mysterious of all  --  and possibly most important  --  is John , the creative mainspring , who has lately grown strangely brooding and withdrawn ; he is more thoughtful and tough-minded than the others . <P>  --  TIME , Sept. 22 , 1967
