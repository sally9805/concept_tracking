And when he stops by her pad , her naughty thoughts become a racy reality . // After true-crime writer Bailey Weggins is fired from Gloss magazine , she has to find a new gigfast . So when an opening pops up at the star-gossip rag Buzz , she signs on to cover the celebrity crime beat . Everything is fine until Buzz 's editor in chief , Mona Hodges , is murdered ... and after Bailey finch the body one night at the office , she decides to investigate the death . While she 's sleuthing , she meets Beau Regan , a hunky documentaryfilmmaker . Beau 's so hot , he makes Bailey 's mouth water . When he shows up at her place one night , Bailey serves him dinner . Over dessert , she 's tempted to indulge in a frisky romp between the sheets .... Locking Lips After Beau and I finished dinner , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spilled blueberries into two goblets for dessert . Suddenly , I heard Beau 's voice . " So , tell me ... " I spun around . He stood in the doorway to the kitchen , his brown hair tucked behind his ears . There was a mischievous look in his eyes , a sexy grin on his face . " What ? " I asked . " Why did you call Tom Dickers office posing as my assistant ? " When I first saw Beau , I was asking Tom Dicker-the head of the company that publishes Buzz-some questions about Mona . Later , I called Dickers office and pretended to be Beau 's assistant just to find out his last name . Instead of fessing up to my little ploy , I decided to play it cool . " You think 7 did that ? " I exclaimed , smiling . " Why ? " " You like to play detective . Did you do it to find out what my name was ? " " Is that why you came here tonight ? To try to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I came here tonight . " Suddenly , he reached out with one of his gorgeous forearms and pulled me close . And then he kissed me . Instant Arousal The kiss was long but soft and gentle . I let myself enjoy it , but my mind was racing . Had he shown up because he could n't resist me .. . or was this just a booty call ? Beau stepped back , looking into my eyes . " Shall we have our blueberries now ? " I asked nervously , picking up a goblet in each hand . Shall we have our blueberries now ? Jeez , I sounded like a freakin ' kindergarten teacher . Next I 'd be asking him if he wanted to watch a video of the Care Bears . " We could , " he said . " But I was thinking how nice it would be to go to bed with you right now . " I could feel myself flush . I 'd let myself toy with such an outcome , but now that he 'd announced his intentions so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattered or offended . I set down the goblets , conflicted . Here I was with a ravishingly attractive guy who wanted to go to bed with me-and my instincts about him were the same . We had n't even had a date yet , but why not surrender to the moment ? And it would certainly take my mind off the memory of Mona with her skull bashed in . " You sort of slip by on a technicality , " I said . " I do n't like to sleep with someone on a first date , but we have n't had a date yet . " " Ahhh , how lucky for me , " he said . " Will it wreck it if I ask you to dinner tomorrow night ? " He kissed me again . His hand inched up higher until just the edge of his palm touched my left breast . The Moment of Truth A minute ago I 'd felt unsure of what I was going to do , but now I kissed him back urgently . His hand moved onto my breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand under my shirt and took my breast into his hand . Then both breasts in both hands . As I leaned in , I felt his erection between my legs . I pulled back . " Why do n't you give me a second to make sure my bedroom does n't look like a war zone ? " He smiled . " As long as there 's a bed , I do n't care . " After I closed the bedroom door behind me , I exhaled enough to blow out my windows . It seemed so delicious to give in , yet I knew how guys could be unforgiving if you refused to play the sex-on-the-third-date game . I remembered my impulse when I 'd first seen Beau-and how I 'd been struck with the thought that I 'd many him someday . But if I just gave in , maybe my head would clear . I opened the room 's two windows to let the breeze blow in . When I returned , Beau was standing near the terrace , waiting for me . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " Actually , I was putting away my Scrabble game . I play alone on Sunday nights . " " Well , hopefully I can find a way to please you as much as Scrabble . " When he said that , my legs turned rubbery . He kissed me again . With both hands , he took the bottom of my tank top and pulled it up , breaking the kiss for only a second as the fabric flew over my head . He traced my nipples with his fingers , then with his tongue . I reached my hand down and stroked the very hard spot between his thighs . " I 'm offering a lovely evening breeze in the bedroom , " I whispered . " Lead the way , " he said . Mind-Blowing Bliss Beau followed me to my room and guided me onto my bed . I lay down against the mattress as he leaned over me . He gently nibbled on my earlobe , until my entire body tingled with anticipation . Ever so slowly , he undid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came my underwear . All of my doubts faded , and desire took over . He inched his hand down until he was stroking my thighs . When he slipped his fingers inside me , I let out a soft moan . I pulled his shirt over his head , and he took off his pants and boxers . I stroked his flat stomach , enjoying the j feel of his muscular frame . Then I explored his body with my mouth before he positioned himself between my legs . When he eased inside of me , I breathed a sigh of satisfaction . And soon , he began pumping his hips in a tantalizing rhythm as a wave of heat washed over me . The sex was like him in certain ways : sometimes fast , intense , passionate , and other times unhurried , deliberate , and almost unbearably pleasurable . And he was reluctant to stop . I would drift off to sleep and wake to find his fingers inside me or his mouth moving up one of my thighs . At seven , I opened my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " Bailey , " he whispered , " I have someone coming by my studio soon . " " Okay , " I said . " I 'll let you out . " I pulled on a robe and walked him to the front door . " Thanks for last night , " he said , smiling . " For everything . " " Thank you too . It was a very nice surprise for a Sunday . " " Better than Scrabble ? " he asked . " Scrabble never made my toes curl . " " I 'll call you later , okay ? About dinner . " He kissed me on the mouth . I knew it would be impossible to fall asleep again , but I crawled back into bed . There was no denying how I felt . I had a monster crush on Beau Regan . Adapted from OVER HER DEAD BODY , c copyright 2005 by Kate White . Published by Warner Books , Inc . Sidebar Buy It Now !
