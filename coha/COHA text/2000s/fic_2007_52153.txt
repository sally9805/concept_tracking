ON MY ARRIVAL AT BOARDING SCHOOL in Colbrook , New Hampshire , my classmates assigned me to a small band of Third Form pariahs : two Jews , a lad whose leg had been withered by polio , and an ostensible queer . It was , I accepted , understandable . We four stood apart-one stood both apart and askew-in a corps of fair princes straight in nose and habit and limb . My task was tacit and clear : I had four years to escape my assignment . Instead , matters immediately grew worse . In the lottery of roommates I won William Hobbs Stansforth , end on the freshman football team , and hands-down choice to stroke the freshman crew that spring . At St. Anselms , for reasons I have never grasped , those who rowed first boat for the varsity sat at the highest altar , higher than the footballers , higher than Christ himself . Stansforth found the misfortune of his pairing intolerable . He took command of my hazing to avenge the fates that dared to strike him , and to distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Zion . Will Stansforth looked like a magazine model . Not those louche men in today 's ads posing as seducers or felons , but the magazines of the forties and fifties , broad-browed men whose hair parted easily and eternally , who sold Arrow shirts and Packard automobiles . Will-I called him that even though he was my tormentor-conceived the plan to glue the door of Raymond 's room shut so that he missed chapel and ended up on probation . Will set off under Micah 's bed a midnight matchbox packed with red sulfur heads and a single stick match as its fuse . Will presided over the Holy Week trial where Micah and I stood charged with turning Jesus over to the Romans . Under Will 's leadership ( indeed he was elected captain of the freshman crew for this very quality ) , meal trays rearranged themselves in commons so that we four outcasts found no place to sit and ended up in the chapel anteroom , eating from our laps . The four of us had only each other . Until Thompson quit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeaking like a trapped mouse , leaving three . Pudge Raymond was a girlish thirteen-year-old , nascent breasts and no body hair . Pudge regularly cut the required sports period to wander the grounds or to sit idly by the hockey ponds plucking the wings from mayflies . The masters let him go . Even in class his daydreaming was regarded as irremediable . His conversation was similarly odd . Without warning , lines of poetry leapt from his mouth . Whether it was the lines themselves or the contrast between the high style and cracked voice that delivered them , embarrassed listeners sniggered into their fists and returned later to beleaguer him . Even , I 'm sad to admit , me . He had no particular talents . In the unspoken order of rank , athletes were revered , scholars tolerated , and sly honor paid to those who could " cut , " whose bullying took the form of verbal humiliation . Pudge had none of these skills and found no stairwell up the castes into the grace of his classmates . Will Stansforth knew how to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art history classroom were decorated with prints of the old masters . In a Tintoretto , stubby , golden-haired cherubs filled the skies of paradise . One day , higher than the master could see and in ink , a red-cheeked angel sprouted an arrow with the words " Form Fag . " The resemblance was uncanny . Who first decided Pudge was homosexual I can not remember , but pronounced in Tintoretto 's heaven it became canon . Micah Kogan was a different piece of work . He was from New York City , itself suspect for its decadence and liberalism . His parents were both psychiatrists . He had a sharp wit , knowledge of the mysteries of psyche and sex , and a remarkable mind . Because of some condition with no visible symptoms , he was excused from phys ed . His appearance set him apart : Mediterranean coloring , a long , Carradine profile , black hair worn uncommonly long in dishabille . These traits made him unusual ; combined with a Sanhedrin bearing , they made an exotic . Most unsettling , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our classmates , Micah ignored them . He became , though I wished otherwise , my best friend . I had little choice . The conspiracy of the trays threw us together meal after meal , and the appearance of us banding together became a reality . The matter was important to my parents . On every call they inquired into my social progress . Are you getting along ? Do you have friends ? My mother had no expectations-that I mentioned names ( and nicknames , she liked nicknames ) satisfied her . But my fathers farewell speech had addressed associations , and I knew that he was betting the considerable tuition on my ability to ingratiate myself to advantage . For my part , like Pudge Raymond , I was without the skills for acceptance . To no one 's surprise , I proved not to be a scholar , although my performance was passable . Nor was I an athlete . Finally , I lacked every element of wit : courage , imagination , language , irony , a taste for cruelty . My tactic was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in our study of France 's Third Republic . Conciliation and agreeableness . The year passed . Thompson showed the white flag and retreated to Chappaqua . Pudge Raymond played the female lead in The Pirates ofPenzance , receiving , on a remarkable performance , hoots and whistles onstage and a semester of androgynous proposals off . Micah finished at the top of the class . That our group stayed together irritated Will Stansforth , and he led his crusade into darker , more virulent adventures . For my part , I conciliated , I agreed . I coached Will through Caesars campaign in Gaul to a respectable C ; I attended every regatta and cheered our shell past Middlesex and St. George ; I endured the hazings and jokes , the disappearing notebooks and the liniment in jockstraps , with what I hoped passed for equanimity . Second year , new meat was fed to the lions . Will had baffled underclassmen to harangue ; our group had lost its novelty . My inexplicably sunny response and Micah 's success took an edge off the fun of bedeviling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Will was freed from living with an inferior . Micah and I moved into a sparely furnished double : military cots , two desks and chairs , attached lavatory . On the walls a square scarlet pennant with the school 's name in black block letters , my corkboard of sports clippings from the school paper where I was heeling , and Micah 's framed prints from the Metropolitan . He had an El Greco , Vermeer 's girl with a ewer , and Rembrandt 's Drapers " Guild . It was an uneasy home . Micah had sought to room alone , a privilege rarely granted Fourth Formers , and I had hoped for a roommate who would lighten , not confirm , the stigma I carried . Yet Micah was an easy roommate . We rarely disagreed . He got an irregular allowance , and I was happy to advance him monies during his lean days . He seemed bothered when , his check finally in the bank and he eager to repay me , I made light of the loans . They were trivial sums . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had his tics , of course . As we all do . He never undressed in my presence . Most of us had grown used to nakedness : for sports , we showered and changed as a group . I tolerated the crude jokes and teasing , but I suspected that Micah found the jokes ugly , that it was reluctance to hear this form of taunting , and not afflicted bronchi , that got him his phys ed pass . He had struck , in my view , a bad trade-the avoidance of an inconvenience in return for the scorn of the class . He always found a way to be in bed before I came in , or to study until lights were out . Our tormentors seemed to let up . I continued to attend every sporting event I could . Will was playing second-string for the varsity football team , and I began to think of him , without reason or evidence , as a friend . Micah said that my strategy , which he compared to the plan of Richard III to win the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sy . Your cleverness is wasted on them . They do n't think in terms of flattery and tactics . They think in terms of clean cages and feeding times . " We were walking back from a movie in Colbrook . His deans list status gave him privileges , and in his imperious way he 'd expanded some of them to include me . On Saturdays , off-campus hours extended till ten . The housemaster was afraid of him : Micah argued that the privilege signified only if he could take a pal , and the master agreed . I found myself defending them . " They 've forgotten us . They accept us . They 've lived with us for a year , and they understand that we do n't have horns . " Micah shot me a look . We had just studied Michelangelo 's Moses , which had horns . " You know what I mean : that we are n't plotting a revolution . " Again he glanced from under the dark thatch across his forehead : I knew I had failed him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're simple organisms . They do n't react to what we do . They react to their own stimuli . " " Meaning ? " " Meaning , they 're in good spirits at the moment . These things come in waves . Look at world history . They came in waves under both Nicholases , under Goebbels . Here , too . " " So you expect more ? " Micah snorted . The sound could have been derision or fear . It could have been both . " They react to their own terror . When they feel pressure , we 'll feel pressure . I promise you . " I considered his warnings for nights afterward . Would there really come a pogrom at St. Anselm 's ? The fall was dry , the air luscious and scented . The ivy draping the dark brick of the campus buildings turned fire red , and the leaves on the trees went to umber and gold , magenta and honey . It was not a time to think those thoughts . Micah and I took to meeting after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek Revival building given by the Class of " 27 . Its loggia let out into a copse of sugar maple , then down marble stairs with a rail made of supports that were themselves marble , the shape of bowling pins . " Not a rail , " Micah told me . " A balustrade . " It was protected space . Branches intertwined overhead and made a cool tunnel , where we felt safe and private . We would sit on the top step and sing popular songs to each other , compare the merits of Perry Como to those of Eddie Fisher . We wondered whether Elizabeth Taylor-her picture in strapless gown had gone up on my corkboard-would stay with Richard Burton , whose lofty and echoing voice we loved to imitate . We wondered whether John Fitzgerald Kennedy would indeed seek a newer world , as Tennyson and he urged us to do . Just as we were making plans based on the immutability of our lives , two events happened that were parallel cracks in the earth 's surface . One was that Kennedy got shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sturdy , as we . We who were fans walked about in a special brand of shock , unable to say what innocence had been offended . I found myself discussing the events of his death and that of his killer with the increasing vulnerability that forges friendships . No one could put a name to what it was we were feeling , until Micah did . He sent a piece , unsolicited , to the Scarlet Letter , the weekly student newspaper where I 'd apprenticed . They printed it on the front page alongside a second essay , which took the view , predominant in the student body , minimizing Kennedy 's importance . Everyone read Micah 's column . It led with a trope . We 'd just been taught to look for them . In medicine , an injury to a nerve is called an insult . Only the son of doctors would know such stuff . And Micah said this insult was threefold : It was to the man , whom some of us admired and some did n't . It was to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And last , it was an insult to hopes , the hopes he himself had expressed that attending to virtue through sacrifice and achievement would purge ugliness and bigotry and make us a better people . " We all , " wrote Micah , " yearn to be better , even when we are drilling ourselves in the penmanship of stupidity . " Micah 's triumph got him an invitation to join the board of the paper . It was unheard of , a sophomore in an editorial position , and not a precedent I found easy to accept , since I was still writing squibs about junior varsity events that ran only when they needed an extra inch . I consoled myself that the Letter 's editorial page was roundly ignored : Its attempts to spark opinion about better lunch meats or the paucity of butt rooms were tendentious and stuffy , the exact opposite of the breezy hipness the students respected . All that would change with Micah . But not until after the second signal event , an event that followed the assassination by days . Eight days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy was assassinated on the Friday before Thanksgiving . On that Saturday recurs the oldest prep football game in the country , between St. Anselms and Bingham Wood . Over the objections of many alumni , who argued that JFK , a Choatie , would opt for keeping the schedule , the game was postponed a week . Neither team was particularly adept that year , and the outcome had significance only to the rounded and self-referring universes that were the schools . There , of course , it was paramount , every student at our school coming out for a rally at which I was to toss the Form torch onto the bonfire . The job was handmaiden to a cheerleader . In my energy to win it , I 'd gotten myself the reputation of a jock sniffer , a wonderfully vivid term for those who lived lives of quiet admiration . I myself thought the name considerably better than the ones I was leaving behind . Micah 's essay on the day of the game asked the students to maintain perspective . The assassination of the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported him , and should n't be pushed out of consciousness by a schoolboy game , no matter how old the match or how expensive the tuition . The short piece ran as a by-lined column . It received hardly any mention during the day 's rout . Afterward , at the mixer with girls herded in from nearby Harkness Hall , I began to hear Micah 's name murmured . How could a newspaper article be responsible for the drubbing we had taken ? I went about eavesdropping on clusters of footballers . They had expected the evening 's adulation to roll out a carpet of opportunity . Instead , they found themselves greeted with that particular derision that , with a six-foot scarlet and black scarf , identified the St. Anselms student . And what were the young women to think ? To side with the " cutters " rather than the cut was easier and far more laughs . The players disappointed in war would now be disappointed in love . They skulked into the shadows , sipping from pints of Four Roses smuggled in to lubricate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-trousered , dressed in a frock , and bound to a seat on the Harkness Hall bus . The sign around his neck said , TAKE HER , SHE 'S YOURS . Micah came home to find his bed tossed , his drawers emptied , and his beloved prints defaced . Vermeer 's lovely kitchen maid had been given , in black marker , nipples the size of plums . " Is n't it interesting how skilled they are as vandals . " I asked what he meant . " Look , Sy. see how completely they destroy the painting . " He did n't comment on the Rembrandt . There the only young and hatless man in the Guild now wore earlocks and , like the negative of a half-moon , a black skullcap . No one reported the attacks . Pudge made us swear to keep his secret . I disagreed . " You must have seen them . You must know who they are . " " They wore pillowcases , " he said . " Like the clan , " Micah pointed out . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening . " You saw their clothes . You could recognize their clothes . " I had n't yet gotten it . " Numerals . " Freshman who qualified were awarded their class year on a sweater . " So you could identify them from that , " I argued . " Who will the school believe ? " Pudge asked with cool logic . " Who are they going to discipline ? Me , or next year 's first string ? " Micah also wanted no part of an investigation . He paid me no mind . He took the prints out of their frames and threw them in the trash . I heard nothing more about it . He bought and hung the single replacement , a print of George Grosz 's Metropolis . In it , Isherwood-vintage Berliners prowled a caf , their faces flushed with lurid appetite . That was the end of it for Micah . Whenever I brought up justice or revenge , he addressed me with a distant look . Clearly he regarded my innocence with something less than envy . The end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After he 'd measured and put in two hooks lest it tilt , he turned to me to speak the lesson . " Someone said you can cure most evil just by giving it a name . " He pinged the frame with a fingernail and looked to make sure I was paying attention . " Most , but not all . " We went back to the pastoral of school life . The year ended and the next began . As a reward for his academic performance , Micah got his single room . He and I saw less of each other . Junior year Pudge sang the Queen of the Fairies in Iolanthe , and Yum Yum in Mikado the next . I had to admire his courage . More and more classmates did . Those things are unpredictable , often a matter of numbers . With a single , deciding vote , the balance pan can silently tilt in one 's favor . Micah headed the editorial page junior year . Its views became increasingly strident and worldly : What was the ethical dimension of requiring Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If history is written by the winners , should not literature take account of the losers ? Should President Johnson continue to choose in Vietnam between regimes of equal brutality ? In a story that the newspaper did n't run but we all knew about , Micah boycotted Saturday classes . Saturday was the sabbath for some students , and although he practiced no religion , he thought others might follow . They did . The school discontinued the classes . Senior year he took over the entire newspaper . The editor-in-chief gained an automatic seat in the honor society , and the inherited respect of the student body . In his first editorial for the semester he challenged his wary classmates . If the only value , as Harold Macmillan wrote , of a superior education is to teach us when the other fellow is talking bosh , have we learned the lesson ? Each of us must ask of our parents " and our school 's teaching : How much is received wisdom , how much unexamined tradition , how much bosh ? What can we throw out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks and answers that question for himself , he has learned at best facts and dates . Which is to say , nothing of value . Micah was off and running . He lived down the hall from me . I had become the manager of the varsity football team , my repertorial career never having progressed beyond inch graphs on the rifle team and intramural softball . With my title came the privileges of cleaning football cleats and inventorying adhesive tape , and a small measure of regard . I had been asked by Will Stansforth to be his roommate again . It was n't exactly comradeship . Will had continued in Latin-four years of a language was required-and he confessed I was his only hope of seeing Aeneas through his wanderings . I would stop by Micah 's room on the way to my own spacious suite for private conversations . In public , Micah rarely demonstrated our friendship , and I did n't encourage him . Knowing Micah sent a mixed message . I had n't realized he had the same view of our layered relationship ( we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and complexity in relationships was a vogue , much as blue blazers ) until I poked in his doorway a week before Christmas vacation . He sat at his desk , bent over a text in the light of a gooseneck lamp . I asked him how he felt the paper was doing , and he turned the question back on me . " I think it 's a great paper , Micah . Honest . " " But ? " Micah was always interested in the But . He told me once that compliments helped only the giver . " But ... " I hesitated . I knew what Will 's friends thought , and I thought so , too . I simply was n't up to debating the merits with Micah . I took care to discuss my views only with people who held them . Besides , Micah was ferocious in debate , and I did n't pick fights I could n't win . " But , " I plunged on , " last week 's tirade on the Christmas play . I mean , give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by Christmas . That 's how it is . If we have equal time for every religion of the world , we 'll have performances through the spring solstice . " " I think you mean equinox . " He said it coolly , even with a slight smile . " There are only two solstices , winter and summer . When the sun is farthest from the celestial equator . " " Whatever , " I said , emboldened by his failure to attack " I mean , on some things you 've got to go along with the majority . That 's just the way it is . " He smiled like someone conspiring in a secret , and seemed to mark my words . " Actually , Sy , that is n't the way it is . I do n't have to go along . I do just the opposite . I remind the majority that I 'm here . A little jab in their gray-flanneled bottoms . In the fleshy part , maybe six inches below the buckle in the back . Just the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert . " " Keeps them talking about you , " I said in rebuttal . He took it as confirmation . " Exactly . I do n't have to go along . But I think you do . " " Me ? " I wanted to rein back the concern in my voice . By senior year we were well practiced in the art of indifference , all but Micah . The ideal tone indicated that one did n't care . I usually had it down pat , and I was surprised to hear the lapse in my voice , even for a syllable . " You . You 're a case study , Sy . " He reached up and turned the switch on the lamp , sinking himself into darkness . Now it was my expression that could be read , Micah who had the reader 's perch . " A case of what ? " I recovered the right voice , but I was curious . In the darkness he shrugged , as if deciding how much to share . Is this what his parents did-diagnosed neurotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , how much he could handle for his own good ? " Think of it , Sy . " His voice was kind , intimate . " Your behavior . You do n't collect debts that are owed you , you make sure that money is seen as of no interest to you . " I was n't sure where he was going . " You express no opinions . You speak softly , even in butt-room arguments . You affect indifference about everything . The last thing you 'd like to be considered is ambitious . Or loudmouthed . Or a New Yorker . " " But I 'm not a New Yorker . " " No , and you 're not grasping or avaricious . You 're assimilated . Not merely assimilated , you 're the anti-Shylock . " " I do n't see what you 're saying . " The sentence , I realized , expressed my discomfort at the darkness around him . " The anti-Shylock ? Bassanio is the anti-Shylock , and many people think he 's the hero of the play . He stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , " Micah said tiredly , " so Mr. Goodnough says . " The English master taught every work as a struggle between the outsider 's morality and that of the community . Beware the easy-think , he would warn . Just because the outsider is alone , does n't mean he 's right . The statement had achieved currency in the Sixth Form . I quoted it to Micah . His smile deepened . Micah spoke warmly , without a tinge of scold . " You think you 're invisible . You think you have the perfect disguise . But you 'll learn differently " That was the last conversation I had with Micah for forty years , but one . I remember it word for word , the lighting , the back-and-forth , the sense of prescience in Micah 's posture . I remember it as clearly as I remember the last conversation , the one where he told me what I thought of for those next forty years as Micah 's story . We muddled through our final months . There were the athletic awards , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaperones , shared limousines , flasks of blackberry brandy ( common wisdom had it that Harkness Hall girls guzzled the syrupy stuff ) . There was the frantic week in which the major colleges announced their decisions . All but one of our class seniors went on to college . Pudge Raymond declared that he was moving to Greenwich Village , to enter the theater . The news confirmed the widely held suspicion about his sexuality , to the delight of everyone who held it . The rest of us chose from what now seems a narrow range of schools , narrow and selective . Commencement weekend . By June , southern New Hampshire had wrested from its inattentive weather gods a legitimate spring . The campus sprouted with new colors , the yellows and pinks of transplanted daffodils and tulips . Parents , alumni , even we who knew better , took a last and verdant snapshot for our memories . The faculty pulled the plastic bags off their gowns for the processional ; a prosperous alumnus was announced as the commencement speaker . And we awaited the closing issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final college destinations , and the name of the valedictorian . None of which was news . Honors hung on two or three names . Will Stansforth got most of the athletic awards : He had lettered in four sports , throwing the shot in the spring season while the crew were idle . College destinations had been disclosed as we replaced the scarlet and black regimental tie with those of our new loyalties . And the senior who led the academic class , who would deliver the address Ave et Vale , Hail and Farewell , had occupied that spot since he had arrived . We gathered on a bright morning on the grass of the quadrangle . We waited out the headmaster 's last reading of the lesson , last uttering of the obvious , last wishes . We heard the president of a large pension advisory firm , who had donated new weight and exercise rooms , tell us that the future lay before us . And we settled back , amid a few groans and whispers , for Micah Kogan to deliver the valedictory . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing memorable , nothing to gasp at . But of course I had heard it all before , as had those of my classmates who 'd read his columns . The gasps came from the parents and the guests , who expected , I suppose , the " We thank thee and go forth " stuff one sees in movies about places like this . Micah gave them both barrels . Challenge the received wisdom . Throw off the prejudices that retard our civilization and benefit only those who perpetuate them . I do remember , maybe not the exact words , but how he closed . Tradition holds that the Latin phrase ave et vale appear in the address . Usually it is applied to the school itself , if not literally , then as metonymy for the faculty , the head , and the encrusted momentum of St. Anselm 's . Not Micah . He explained the phrase and discarded its usual sense . " Some of you will walk down the road , " he said and pointed loosely to the south , " to the college I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't need to wish you hail and farewell , and I wo n't . To the others , I say this . You can keep to the faith of your fathers . I 'm not talking religion , I 'm talking stupidity . You can keep to the mistakes and the protection and the privilege , and close your eyes to the world around you . Or you can listen to your own conscience . It wo n't be me ; you 'll have to find a conscience for yourself . To those of you who choose to , I say , Hail and welcome . To those of you who choose not to , I say , Hail , farewell , and good riddance . " There was applause . Most seniors , inured to Micahs provocations , were happy to see the speech end . Others began chanting his name- " Ko-gan ! Ko-gan ! " - in an ominous rhythm . The headmaster stood up to dispel any insubordination . Diplomas were awarded , the school song was reverently sung , and the class dispersed . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's only inn , a highball for the new graduate , then a last night in the dormitory . A few seniors went out to celebrate . At eighteen , most of us had a drivers license , and it was an easy thing to borrow the family car and rip over the border to a state where the same age attended drivers and drinkers . If they had n't been drinking , Micahs story would likely not have happened . In the middle of my last night at St. Anselm 's I was roused by shouting . Angry , frightful shouting . Except for the hour I would have guessed , from the stagy German accents and the vileness of the words , it was a typical stunt , a schoolboy lampoon . But I came awake with a start , a strong pulse in my throat . The dormitories were built when New England brick was plentiful and New England labor cheap . They are red brick on the outside and painted brick within . Barrel-vault archways interrupt the fortress walls , arches , and fitted oaken doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . The shouting traveled up a stairwell , onto my floor , followed by the shouters , and grew louder with my heartbeat . It ended with the unmistakable slamming of a door down the hall . Just down the hall . There were more words , ugly words , bouncing off a shut door , and the tattoo of fists on wood , until someone-not I , frozen in my bed-yelled out to can it . I sat until the night 's quiet returned . Then I put on a summer robe and let myself out . In the suite 's third room , Will 's door was ajar and his bed was empty . The halls had an eerie feeling . The underclassmen had packed and vacated . You would n't think you could sense the absence of posters and pennants and lacrosse sticks and ski gear , dressers emptied of clothing . The building had been my home for four years , and now its tissue and life had disappeared . I rapped softly on Micah 's door and whispered for him to open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ready for a cleaning . At first I thought he did n't recognize me , but after half a minute he stepped back and let me in . " What happened ? " Micah kept his head perfectly still . His face was tilted up and his chin jutted out as if the angle would keep the tears pooled in the lids . " They got me , " he said at last . " Who ? Who got you ? What did they do ? " " Twice . The first time they stripped me . Held me down and pulled off my clothes . I was sitting by the music room , just thinking . They jumped me , stripped me , stuck me in a car . Left me at Harkness HaU . At the gates . " " My God . What did you do ? " He shrugged . Clearly I had n't heard the worst of it . Until then I had never noticed the color of his eyes-is n't that odd , if the eyes are the windows to the unconscious , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , their gray liquid flashing . " I made my way back . There was n't much traffic , so I just walked the side of the road and ducked whenever a car came along . " " And ? " I was imitating his Socratic technique . " I went back for my clothes . All but the tie , I ca n't seem to find the tie . They were balled up by the fence . " He meant the Class of " 27 balustrade , the very one where so often we 'd met . " I just finished dressing , they got me again . I must have been upset " cause I never heard them coming . " " And ? " " They called me names . The usual . They did n't like my little talk . They started to punch me . When I did n't fight back , they lost interest . Then one of them had the idea ... " Tears spilled over , and he stuck his chin even farther out . He might have been searching the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark fascination . " They shaved me , " he said at last . " Shaved and painted me . " " What do you mean ? " His hair was a tossed mess , though best I could tell , all there . He unbuckled his belt and let his trousers fall . Put his thumbs in the waistband of his undershorts and , before I could protest , lowered them . His pubic hair was gone . From the belly down , he was lacquered brown . " My God , " I said . The sight was a hard blow to the chest . His genitals looked like a turkey neck and giblets . I stood humiliated by his humiliation . There was enough to go around . The one bulb in the ceiling lit our faces in a single undiffused light . And the story had a weird effect on me-it told me of matters I knew but was n't aware of knowing . " Is it water-based , do you think ? Will it wash off ? " I did n't know what else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants up nor look away . I did n't want him to know how desperately sad I found it all . " It 's some stuff they give the jocks . They use it for calluses . It 'll wash off ? " He pulled up his trousers . We talked some more . I wanted him to call the headmaster , to report them . He still had n't mentioned names and I had n't asked . He said no , he had thought it through . When ? On his last run from their grasp ? As he stood watching my fearful eyes ? The school , he said , no longer had jurisdiction . With the passing of the diploma , they moved from authority to supplicant . Now their single interest was in cozying up to donors . It was a question of numbers ; there were several of them and only one Micah . And unlike the forebears of our classmates , generations of Kogans had not attended St. Anselm 's . " Were you scared ? " I asked before I left . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know why ? " I shook my head . He took several breaths , preparing to tell me something else I was sure I did n't want to know . " I think that last caper-the shaving , the cotton balls . I think it excited them . " When I was asked to chair our fortieth reunion , I was genuinely complimented . I had never held a class office , and the post is a mark of some distinction . I found in Will Stansforth a perfect capital gifts chair : After college he had gone into the family real estate business and had made a bundle when they sold out to a Chicago firm . ( " A Jewish family , Sy , " he told me . " Perhaps you know them . " ) He was preparing a significant gift to the school we both hoped would be the seed for more . I decided to design the program myself . I tracked down all our members , even the widows of those who had died , and sent a letter of invitation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some hours would be spent in reminiscence ; the school wanted an hour for its pitch ( " Just as you remember it , only better " ) , and we still needed an after-dinner talk or two . I wanted something else-something provocative . I had no ideas . I 've had a professional life teaching English at a private school that would love to be St. Anselm 's . It 's been satisfying , but it does n't train one in the skills of subverting the norm . My clue came when I received the letter of regret from Pudge Raymond . Not of regret . That is etiquette 's term for the response , but there was no regret in Pudge 's words . He remembered me fondly , he said , me and Thompson the cripple , and Micah the rabbi . Those were his words . Micah the rabbi , the teacher . Other than that , he had , " alas , not a single pleasant memory of the place . Possibly the time I spent weeping by the hockey ponds . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectable Off-Broadway theater . He 'd been in the business since he left St. Anselm 's , which , he noted , prepared him not at all for his life . He was married to a woman whose name I thought I recognized , a minor actress on the fringe of Off-Broadway theater . He was the father of four and the grandfather of three . And , he said without further comment , he was " not and never have been a homosexual . Just in case my name comes up and someone asks . If I were , I would have pulled the trigger on that target rifle whose barrel I had in my mouth more than once . " The letter set me thinking . My memories of schooldays had clarified with the years , like butter , where the impurities seem to disappear in the warming liquid . Some of that was the result of the school 's impressive propaganda effort , some the civility with which my classmates now treated me . But I was beginning to dredge up just why Pudge had reacted so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote to three or four of our class 's most successful members , asking if they would speak at the reunion about some aspect of their life at St. Anselm 's , what it meant to them . For all but one , I left the choice of content to the speaker . But to Micah I wrote , The incidents of your last night at school have stayed with me . I ca n't tell you how often I 've thought of them . I wonder how , after your exceptional achievements , they seem to you in reflection . This need n't be a speech or a rebuke or anything else you do n't wish , but I wonder if you would say a few words and tell your story . I got a delicious pleasure thinking about it . What would be the narrative form ? Better to name names at the start , like a reporter would ? Or to hold them until the end , framing an arc of discovery ? Maybe I was feeling pushed around by the school 's effort to glaze things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to happen ; maybe I was finally taking to heart Micah 's lecture about my own frailties . Whatever it was , after I got acceptances from all speakers , I printed the program with Micah 's name last . His story would be the evening 's summation . And , given Micah 's prominence , no one would see it coming . He had gone on to graduate summa from his college , to edit the law review at the same university , and to enjoy a remarkable career . Most of it had been spent at a large San Francisco law firm that he had managed for two decades and where , the Fortune article on him noted , he had been the first Jewish partner . He had interrupted his tenure , once to serve as counsel to a senate committee and twice to accept presidential appointments to lead trade delegations . His portrait had appeared as well in a Forbes story on rainmakers at the great law firms . The picture showed him standing in front of a wall of photographs , decorations , and awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cover . His note responding to my letter was a beautiful thing , its ease , its warmth . He wrote with a fountain pen on heavy cream stationery with his name , not his firm 's , and his office address . As if that might be a second home . I 've kept it . Dear Sy How good to hear from you . I follow your career in the alumni magazine and always feel a twinge of pride when I read of your accomplishments . I often recall our boyhood friendship . Given the time we spent idling by the " 27 Stairs , it 's a wonder we 've both amounted to anything . Of course I will attend the Fortieth , and I would be honored to be on the program . I will take no more than five minutes . Please let me know if you need anything further , and thank you for your work on behalf of the class . Best , Micah The note made me smile . It came to my office , and when I reread the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were certificates on the occasion of my twentieth and thirtieth anniversaries on the faculty , and a walnut plaque from the local Rotary for a food drive I 'd led for the victims of a Caribbean hurricane . Our reunion day had a heavy schedule . After an all-classes lunch , we watched the varsity heavyweight shell outsprint Bingham Wood , then made a tour of the new facilities-the usual stuff . I looked eagerly for Micah . His secretary had called days before to warn me he might not be able to get up to Colbrook until evening , but to assure he 'd be there . Dinner was black tie , held in the commons . Many men brought their wives . The new headmaster , looking for all the world like an undergraduate , worked the room during cocktails , and the old place was glittering with the jewelry and bright eyes of comfortable success . We were seated , and the chair next to mine , Micah 's , was empty . I took out my program and began to make notes in case he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrogate ; I would name names . As I wrote , there was a buzz in the room and Micah entered . His hair had silvered and he had grown full in the middle-not heavy , but there was no longer the look of the wandering scholar about him . Quite the opposite . His tuxedo was perfectly tailored , and he was clearly at ease in it . He managed to greet nearly everyone in the room , shake hands and say a few personal words that lit each face with recognition . When he spotted me , he came around the head table . " Sorry , Sy . A handshake wo n't do . Un embrazo ? He took me to his chest and squeezed . Perhaps , I thought , perhaps we had matured : this genuine affection between men , in front of men , once so discomfited by emotions . The room watched us . " You look wonderfuir I told him , as if he were an old beau . " Hale . Prosperous . He laughed . " Hale and hearty . Prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I looked into his face to see whether he was teasing , and I could n't tell . He paid his respects to the others at the head table , lingering over the headmaster and his wife , shaking hands with Will Stansforth as if they had crewed the same shell . But of course it was a collegial evening . I began to wonder if I had pushed too hard , if in fact this was the forum to scratch old scabs . I had n't much time to reconsider because Micah had us all talking , about St. Anselm 's , about our half century in the world , about education and youth and age . Everyone 's opinions came out but his . I could n't tell whether he was a Democrat or a Republican , capitalist or Bolshevik , believer or agnostic . The main course was cleared , the dessert served , and a cart began around the room with coffee , walnuts , and Stilton . Someone announced he 'd opened a dozen bottles of port , bottled the year of our graduation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and I rose to begin the program . What we heard we could have written without making the trip . The headmaster spoke of the school and how we typified its highest ambitions ; the class treasurer made a plea for dues ; Stansforth delivered an impressive cardboard check the length of a chaise longue . I introduced the last entry on the program . " If the next speakers , all of whom have promised they 'll be brief , throw cold water on our assembly , it will be , I hope , cooling and refreshing . I 've asked four classmates to speak of their St. Anselm 's experience , in the spirit of candor and constructive provocation . Compliments , " and I glanced down at Micah , " help only the giver . " The first three were quite mild . One spoke to the pain of being hopelessly uncoordinated in a society that tolerated only athletes . " There were as many teams as there were students , " he said , " yet I did n't win my numerals or my letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tonight I 'm offering $10,000 to the scholarship fund if someone will award me a varsity sweater . " A letter sweater was produced . Black and boat neck , an authentic antique , a crimsom S entwining an A. He produced the check , took off his tuxedo jacket , and donned the sweater . There was raucous applause . I introduced Micah . I gave only the briefest biography , saying that to do otherwise would take all his allotted time . He rose , and I settled back to hear , after forty years of reflection , his story . And it never came . He spoke of the school , of its traditions . He spoke of the dedicated faculty and the extraordinary effect of their regimen on his own intellectual history . He was funny , touching , thoughtful , and he somehow managed to take his remarkable career and turn it around so that it bathed us all in light of royal purple . I kept waiting for the But . It never came . He spoke of the formative experience that working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the rigors of writing because they simulated the rigors of thinking . He even quoted Mr. Goodnough quoting Aristotle that thought is the thought of thought . And he spoke of his classmates-a few , including me , by name-whose friendship had opened him to important matters of the heart . It was a wonderful speech , and it brought the crowd , for the only time other than Will 's giant check , to their feet . But his story remained untold . We said good-bye with a handshake and a second embrace . I looked into his eyes , and he could read my question . I suppose a talented negotiator can do that . " I hope you did n't mind , Sy . It does n't do any good to rub people 's noses in it . If they have n't changed by now , they never will . Better to leave them warm and fuzzy , do n't you think ? No need to be disagreeable . " Perhaps he 's right . Perhaps they never will . Micah seems to have moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurt inflicted on Micah inflicted as well on me-is that it ? - but instead of howling I buttoned up ? I smiled and fetched the water bottle and took a tongue depressor to players " cleats to scrape off the mud , and inside thought , Thank God it 's not me . And only now , forty years later , am I crying out .
