<p> TO all those public company shareholders who are trying to make directors more accountable to owners and more watchful over executives : Cheer up . Your efforts seem to be gaining genuine traction . <p> How do we know ? Martin Lipton told us so . <p> Mr. Lipton , of course , is the nation 's pre-eminent takeover lawyer and founding partner of Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen &; Katz . He invented the poison pill in the 1980s , a device that entrenched me-first managers threatened by takeover artists . More recently , Mr. Lipton has become the apologist for embattled chief executives who do n't like shareholders sounding off on excessive pay and cozy boards . <p> Last week , he sounded a grave warning at the 25th annual Institute on Federal Securities in Miami . " Today shareholder activism is ripping through the boardrooms of public corporations and threatening the future of American business , " he said in a keynote speech to the legal and corporate crowd that had assembled . Directors are under siege , he averred , thanks to shareholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collegiality of the board of directors . " <p> Finally , Mr. Lipton thundered : " We can not afford continuing attacks on the board of directors . It is time to recognize the threat to our economy and reverse the trend . " <p> As part of his speech , Mr. Lipton also asked such fundamental questions as whether qualified people would agree to serve as directors in the current environment and whether directors would become so risk-averse that their companies would suffer . <p> Those are both worthwhile topics for a reasoned , probing discussion . But the sheer desperation in Mr. Lipton 's speech , called " Shareholder Activism and the Eclipse of the Public Corporation , " subverted the more intellectually challenging elements of his argument , leaving what remained something of a rant . As such , it may have been the best proof yet that shareholders ' rightful demands to make directors more accountable are getting results . <p> Mr. Lipton did not return a phone call seeking comment . <p> Mr. Lipton is a sophisticated , savvy lawyer . But his thesis  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon which they hope to build a prosperous retirement  --  does n't make much sense . He seems to see shareholders as infants who should stay in their cribs and leave big corporate decisions to wise men on the board , in the corner suite and , of course , in law offices . <p> " It 's almost like listening to a small boy who has lost his favorite toy  --  in this case the poison pill that is held in disrepute , " said Herbert A. Denton , president of Providence Capital in New York . As an adviser to minority shareholders , Mr. Denton has faced the likes of Conrad M. Black , the disgraced former chief executive of Hollinger and Richard Scrushy , former chief executive at HealthSouth . <p> " I 've sat on nine different boards , " Mr. Denton added . " Sometimes it 's collegial and sometimes hard questions need to be asked , but nobody 's been hit by a plate yet . " <p> If Mr. Lipton had focused his diatribe on marginal activists with kooky agendas or hedge funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible . But he seems to consider even thoughtful people , who are trying to persuade directors to exercise their fiduciary duties , as enemies of corporate America . <p> Frederick E. Rowe Jr. , a money manager in Dallas and president of Investors for Director Accountability , is an example . His organization , founded last year by a group of entrepreneurs and businesspeople , is working to remind directors of their duties to shareholders . <p> " Resistance makes people think clearly and a C.E.O . does a better job if he has smart people who make him spell out what he 's going to do , " Mr. Rowe said . " That includes directors who think , act , vote and hold management to account like interested , informed , long-term owners . " <p> One of Mr. Lipton 's most persistent themes is the death  --  boohoo  --  of collegiality in the boardroom . " Many director candidates are declining to serve on boards , " he said , " due to the unpleasantness of filling out extensive questionnaires to enable appropriate disclosures and qualification determinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fun . Now that there are so many pesky details involved , we 're taking our marbles and going home . <p> If shareholders are wreaking such havoc in the boardroom by , for example , filing nettlesome lawsuits against able directors , would n't the costs of directors ' and officers ' liability insurance be skyrocketing as a result ? <p> Yes . But instead they have plummeted . Loretta Waters , vice president at the Insurance Information Institute in New York , said that rates on so-called D. &; O. insurance fell almost 40 percent in 2005 , dropped an additional 10 percent last year and would probably decline again this year . <p> " Directors are under greater pressure by shareholders to be more transparent , provide more information , " Ms. Waters said . " I would say that the changes in corporate governance practices and transparency to shareholders as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have likely contributed to the decline in D. &; O. rates . " <p> If the public corporation is an endangered species , as Mr. Lipton argued , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enron , WorldCom , Adelphia and Tyco did not create the scandals that rocked those companies and sowed mistrust among others . Selfish managers and passive directors did that work handily . <p> Almost everyone gets nostalgic , of course . And Mr. Lipton may pine for the days when the poison pill reigned supreme , his chief-executive clients were safe and boards resided quietly in their Amen corner . <p> But those days are over . Greater shareholder involvement in director elections and other board matters is coming , in part because so much wealth has been destroyed at companies with lax oversight . Mr. Lipton 's fear-mongering about its consequences will please his corporate clients , but it wo n't stop the train. ##
