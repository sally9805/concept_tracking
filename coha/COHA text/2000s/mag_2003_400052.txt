11 things to do between lovers FIRST , A CONFESSION : I 'm unlucky in love , romantically challenged , oft jilted . Eventually I had to face facts : More of my life has been spent between relationships than in relationships . And while I have n't given up on the idea of falling into happily-ever-after , I have stopped worrying about where my next boyfriend is going to come from . The day I did that was the day I started living the life I was blessed with , instead of mourning the one I thought I needed . But getting to this place of peace is n't easy . What helped me walk on this path were some important tips from my " family " of other single women , who got me through the rough patches and helped me realize that you only get one life , so you may as well live it up . This is some of the best advice I got from happy single sisters : &gt; 1 Reclaim your peeps . All your peeps : like your girls you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say he did n't have to work late after all . Celebrate the joys of friendship by getting together once a month for a girls-only dinner . And do n't forget your male friends-the ones he did n't like you hanging around . Build warm , mutually supportive relationships with them : Reclaim them ! They 're good to have around to remind you that men are n't all bad . But most of all , do n't forget about reconnecting with family . Schedule regular get-togethers , but if your folks are scattered , call , E-mail or better yet , send them a handwritten note to let them know you 're thinking about them . 2 Take a big swim in Lake You . Learn to love your best friend-you . Go to a movie alone and afterward treat yourself to dinner . Not takeout , but dine-in . It may be scary at first , but in time you 'll find that you are your own best company . After a fly date with yourself , come home and write about it in your new journal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For those who are ever more adventurous , remember how you always wanted to see the world ? You never did because traveling seemed so couple-centric and you were always so party-of-one ? Now is the time . Go with a friend or go by yourself , but just go ! The world is full of beautiful places , and you deserve to experience them . For more information , check out soulofamerica.com , soulplanettravel.com and ugogurl.com  --  sites that are focused on Black folks ' travel desires . 3 Make your place in the world . Sad , Lonely Me took to calling my apartment The Fortress of Solitude . But Independent Me made me see the solitude as a sanctuary . I adorned my place my way by placing piles of pillows and Indian sari fabric in the bedroom and old movie posters in the living room . A friend told me she painted her walls vibrant colors that no one else thought matched , but so what ? They made her feel good . Your decorating scheme may only make sense to you-but that 's the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " guy " stuff so you can put your own curtains and shelves up . If you can do that , then maybe you can do what another sister I know did . She kicked it up a notch by using the between-relationship time not to paint or redecorate , but finally to purchase that condo she 'd put off buying because she was waiting to see if she and her ex would reconcile . Well , he 's gone , but the home is here . And it 's beautiful . And it 's hers . 4 Remember you ai n't no old dog . So learn a new trick . Become an expert at something you 've always had a secret interest in-Hitchcock or hip-hop , wine or Windows . If it turns you on , grab hold . One way to get started is to check out the adult learning center in your city . Take a class in a foreign language , flower arranging , interior design , painting-whatever ! If your passion is simply gazing at paintings in your local museum , become a member there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . In the end it does n't matter what moves your creative or spiritual center . It only matters that you honor it . 5 Become the greatest lover . Of yourself . Of your body . Instead of depending on a man 's compliments to boost your self-esteem , learn to appreciate your body by taking better care of it . Take a dance class . While you 're learning African , ballet , jazz , tango or salsa , you 'll also be getting a great workout . If dance is n't your thing , find some other kind of aerobic exercise that you feel passionate about . After you 've sweated off all that frustration ( or ice cream ) , schedule a massage . If you ca n't afford one at some spa , then contact massage-therapy schools in your area and sign up as a class volunteer and get your massages free . 6 Stand up for others . Volunteer at a shelter for battered women , or participate in a run-walk to raise money for breast-cancer research . Mentor a young girl through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a Court Appointed Special Advocate ( CASA ) for an abused or neglected child ; there 's such a need in our community . Being a court advocate requires about 30 hours of training , but when you finish you 'll be responsible for conducting background research into his or her case and making recommendations to the court on what is best for the child . That way you 'll get more involved in an actual child 's life , instead of sitting around waiting to have kids of your own . For more information , contact National CASA Association , 100 W. Harrison , North Tower Ste. 500 , Seattle WA 98119 ; ( 888 ) 805-8457 or nationalcasa.org. 7 Celebrate all life . Adopt a furry friend from a shelter .

To learn more , contact guidingeyes.com . If dealing with something else that poops and eats ai n't you , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace nature . Take walks in the park , visit your local botanical garden , plant a garden or a window box . My latest project is cultivating an orchid . When provided with tender loving care and nurturing , they bloom gloriously and are a delight to behold-just like me. 8 Throw caution to the wind . A traumatic event involving 5-year-old me , the deep end of the pool and an inattentive baby-sitter left me terrified of water most of my life . Recently I faced down that fear by taking swimming lessons at the Y. Once I mastered that , I could n't be stopped ; I went kayaking up the Hudson River and circled the Statue of Liberty . Other friends have conquered their various demons by changing careers , moving to a new town-or finally learning to drive a stick . No matter what , the objective is for you to kick one , if not all , of your fears to the curb . 9 Remember , men do n't make you sexy . You make you sexy . So flirt shamelessly .

No one has to know you joined the Underwear Liberation Front , so you can wear that thong on a day when the only man you 're liable to talk to is the dry cleaner . However , if you 're moved to make that no-strings-attached booty call , just be sure he 's coming to your place so he has to take the walk of shame back home the next morning ( but do not , repeat , do not , forget the condoms ) . 10 Become a mother of reinvention . So you 're a secretary by day , but Chaka Khan ( in the shower ) by night ? Let other folks discover the real you : Join a choir and give voice to that inner diva who has been hidden away too long . But if you ca n't carry a note , perhaps you 're an aspiring Maya Angelou . Here and now , face down your stage fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ego-gather your girls and host a poetry reading in your home . 11 Live life ! Make that list of things you always wanted to do and set about doing them . The bottom line : You can ( and should ) do them all , even if you have a significant other Life is what happens whether you meet The One or not , so do n't waste it .
