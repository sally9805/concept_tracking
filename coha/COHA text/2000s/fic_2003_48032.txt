MY NAME IS ALITA , WHICH means " girl to be trusted . " My mother calls me Al . If anyone asks , I tell them it 's short for Alonzo , a solid masculine name . At fifteen years of age , I can pass for a boy on the verge of manhood . I dress in men 's clothing , preferring tunic and breeches to petticoats and skirts . <p> My mother plays the harp and sings ballads ; I am a storyteller . I know common folk stories ( rife with bawdy asides and comic characters ) , heroic tales favored by the nobility ( usually involving handsome princes , beautiful princesses , and courtly love ) , and morality tales ( favored by the clergy , but not by many others ) . I know how a story should go . <p> The story that I tell you now is unruly and difficult . It refuses to conform to any of the traditional forms . This story wanders like sheep without a shepherd . It involves a prince and a dragon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ... well , I 'll get to all that presently . <p> I begin my story in the mountain town of Nabakhri , where shepherds and weavers gather each fall . The shepherds come down from the mountains to sell their wool ; the weavers come up from the lowlands to buy . My mother and I come to the festival to entertain the lot of them . <p> Twilight was falling when my mother and I reached the town . We had been traveling for two days , beginning our journey in the warm valley where the Alsi River ran . There , people grew rice and millet and wore bright colorful clothing . In Nabakhri , people grew barley and potatoes , herded goats and sheep , and wore heavy woolen clothing . <p> The trail that led to town was steep , better suited for goats than for our pony . The evening breeze blew from the great glacier that filled the valley to the west of Nabakhri . Our pony 's breath made clouds in the cold , crisp air . <p> At the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the main path . The sheep bleated in protest as dogs nipped at their heels . One of the shepherds , an older man in a ragged cloak , glanced at us . He smiled as he noted my mother 's harp , slung on the side of our pony 's pack . " Musicians ! " he said . " Are you looking for an inn ? " <p> I nodded . After the long summer alone in the mountains , shepherds are eager for music and good company . <p> " The inns in the center of the village are full , " he said . " Try Sarasri 's place . West side of the village , overlooking the glacier . Good food , good drink . " <p> Someone shouted from the direction in which the man 's flock was disappearing . The man lifted a hand in farewell and hurried after his sheep . Sarasri 's was a sprawling , ramshackle inn on the edge of town . We hitched the pony by the open door to the tavern , where the air was rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barmaid called for Sarasri , the innkeeper . <p> Sarasri , a stout , round-faced woman , hurried from the kitchen , drying her hands on her apron . In the lowlands , it 's unusual for a woman to run an inn , but women from the mountain tribes often go into business for themselves . <p> " We 're looking for a room , " I said , but she was shaking her head before the words were out of my mouth . <p> " Alas , young fellow , there are too many travelers this year , " she said . " I do n't know that there 's a room left anywhere in town . " <p> My mother was not listening . She was looking past Sarasri into the tavern . " What do you think I should play tonight , Al ? " she asked me . " It looks like there 'll be quite a crowd . " She smiled at Sarasri - my mother has a smile that could melt the snow on a mountaintop ten miles distant . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sincerely . My mother is warm-hearted and guileless - traits that serve her in good stead . When my father read fortunes with the Tarot cards , my mother was always represented by the Fool , a young man in motley who is about to dance over the edge of a cliff . The Fool is a divine innocent , protected by angels . If he tripped over the cliff 's edge , he would fall into a haystack . <p> Sarasri glanced at my mother . " You are musicians ? It would be nice to have music in the tavern tonight . " She frowned , thinking hard . " I do have one small room .... " <p> The room was used for storage-burlap sacks of potatoes and baskets filled with wool were stacked against one wall . The remaining space was barely big enough for a bed and a table . The window overlooked the glacier - at least we would not wake in the morning to the clamor of the village . <p> " Good enough ? " I asked my mother . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable in a stable stall , as long as she had her harp to play . <p> My father , a conjurer skilled at illusions and fortune telling , had died three years ago , when I was a girl of twelve . After his death , it fell to me to attend to practical details of life , as my mother was ill-suited to such a task . I did my best to take care of her . <p> When the weather was warm , we traveled from town to town . Wherever there was a festival , we performed in the taverns , passing the hat for our keep . In the cold months , we stayed in the lowlands , in the small village where my mother was born . <p> That evening , in Sarasri 's tavern , my mother sang for an appreciative ( and drunken ) crowd of shepherds . Following my mother 's performance , I told the tale of King Takla and the ice woman . With the glacier so near , I thought it appropriate to tell a story about the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins of the river women . River women , as every lowlander knows , are magical creatures that take the form of beautiful maidens with green eyes and long hair the color of new leaves . Ice women are just as beautiful , but their eyes are as blue as the ice in the deep glacial caves and their hair is as white as new snow . Just as the river women inhabit the rivers , the ice women live in the high mountain glaciers . <p> King Takla , the ruler of a small kingdom high in the mountains , was hunting for mountain goats when he found a woman sleeping in a hollow in the glacier . She lay on the bare ice , covered with a white shawl woven of wool as fine and delicate as the first splinters of winter frost on the stones of the mountain . Only her beautiful face was exposed to the cold mountain air . <p> Takla recognized that she was not an ordinary woman . He knew , as all the hill folks know , that taking an ice woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the shawl , revealing the ice woman 's naked body . Ah , she was beautiful . Her skin was as smooth and pale as the ice on which she rested . Her face was that of a sleeping child , so innocent and pure . <p> Takla hid the shawl in his hunting pack . Then , captivated by the woman 's beauty , Takla lay beside her on the ice , kissing her pale face , caressing her naked breasts , stroking her thighs . <p> When she woke and stared at him with cool blue eyes , he spoke to her , saying " You will be my queen , beautiful one . " Though she struggled to escape , he grasped her arms and pulled her close to him . Overcome with passion for this pale maiden , he forced himself upon her . <p> Then Takla wrapped her in his hunting cloak and took her back to his castle to become his queen . He dressed her in fine clothing and adorned her with glittering gems . Her beauty surpassed that of any mortal woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she did , her voice was as soft as the sound of wind-blown ice crystals whispering over the snow . <p> " I must go home , " she told Takla . " My mother will miss me . My sisters will miss me . " <p> " You have a husband now , " he told her . " Your mother will get over it . And if your sisters are as beautiful as you are , they must come to court and find husbands here . " He kissed her pale face . <p> There are different ways one could tell this tale . In the tavern , I told it from King Takla 's point of view , describing the ice woman 's beauty , the allure of her naked body . A magical being captivates a man against his will . She is a lovely temptress . Unable to control his passion , the man takes possession of her . <p> In this version of the story , King Takla is helpless , a strong man stricken by love . In this version , Takla is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice woman , takes her for his queen . What more could any woman want ? <p> I think that the ice woman would tell a very different version of the story . She was sleeping peacefully , bothering no one , when the king raped and abducted her , taking her away from her home and her sisters . <p> This version of the story would not be as popular in the tavern , but I think about it often , particularly when we perform in a tavern filled with soldiers . I am aware that my mother is a beautiful woman and that the soldiers admire more than her music . Because I dress as a young man , I avoid the soldiers ' leers . <p> Of course , the tale of King Takla does not end with his capture of the ice woman . A man who takes a magical creature to his bed must face the consequences of his action . <p> After Takla brought the ice woman to his castle , blue-white lights flickered over the ice fields at night . The glacier moaned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice women were talking among themselves . A year passed and the ice woman bore King Takla a son - a sturdy child with his father 's red hair and his mother 's piercing blue eyes . <p> Not long after his son 's birth , King Takla went hunting alone in the mountains . While following a path that led beside the glacier , he saw a white mountain goat , standing a hundred yards away on the ice . He shot an arrow , and the beast fell . <p> Takla made his way across the ice to where the goat had stood . But when he reached the place where the goat had fallen , he found nothing but ice . A trick of the ice women , he thought , and turned to retrace his steps to the rocky mountain slope . A tall woman with white hair blocked his way . <p> " King Takla , " she said . " You must set my daughter free . " <p> Takla studied the woman . This woman was older than his wife , but just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , the same beautiful body . <p> " Your daughter is my wife and the mother of my son , " he said . <p> " I will reward you handsomely if you let her go , " said the woman . She held out a silver hunting horn . " Release my daughter and sound the horn - and I will come and grant you a wish . Three times I will come when the horn is sounded and three wishes I will grant . " She held the instrument up so that the king could admire its fine workmanship and contemplate what wishes he might make . <p> Takla studied the horn and considered the woman 's offer . He had , over the passing year , grown weary of his wife 's unsmiling silence . Yes , she was beautiful , but he had begun to admire one of his wife 's ladies in waiting , a fiery beauty with auburn hair and dark brown eyes . If he accepted the ice woman 's offer , his wife would return to her people , leaving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , he could become more powerful . <p> Takla smiled and took the horn from the woman 's hand . She stepped aside and he returned to his castle . <p> He took his wife 's white shawl from the trunk where it had been hidden for the past year . When he entered his wife 's chambers , she was suckling his infant son . She saw the shawl in his hands and her blue eyes widened . She handed the baby to her lady in waiting , the beauty who had captured the king 's attention . <p> " What have you brought me ? " the king 's wife asked softly . <p> " Your mother gave me a gift . " The king lifted the horn . " Three wishes will be mine , in exchange for one wish of hers . Her wish is that I set you free . " <p> The king 's wife took the shawl from his hands and wrapped it around her shoulders . Without a word , she left the room , running through the corridor , down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen again . <p> Takla smiled at the lady in waiting , then kissed his son on the forehead . Since the lady held his son cradled in her arms , bestowing this sign of fatherly affection afforded the king an opportunity to admire her bosom . <p> Filled with joy and thoughts of continuing power , Takla took the hunting horn and left the castle , climbing to a rock outcropping that overlooked the glacier , the castle , the pass , and the valley . <p> The Sun was dipping toward the horizon in the west . Takla looked out over his kingdom and thought of his first wish . <p> He put the horn to his lips and blew . A blue light flickered in the glacier below , then the ice woman stood before him . " What is your wish ? " she asked . <p> " I wish that I may remain above all others as I am now and that my reign will last as long as the stones of the mountain . " <p> The ice woman smiled and lifted her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a transformation took place . The king became stone , a royal statue gazing over the kingdom . <p> " As you wish , you will stay here , above all others , " the ice woman said . " Your reign will last as long as the stones of the mountain . Until the wind and the weather wear you away , you will reign over this place . " <p> Among the mountain people , there is a saying . " Like a gift of the ice women , " they say about presents that end up costing the recipient dearly . It is best not to meddle in magical matters . One must not trust a gift of the ice women . <p> I had just reached the end of the story when the wind blew the tavern door open . At the time , I thought that was a stroke of good luck ; the blast of cold air made my listeners shiver and appreciate the story all the more . " A gift of the ice women , " I said , and the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins from those who had enjoyed the tale . When I walked near the kitchen door , I saw that Sarasri was frowning . She spoke to me as I passed . " That 's not a good tale to tell so close to the glacier . You 'd best keep your shutters closed tonight . The ice women wo n't like it that you 're talking about them . " <p> I was a humble storyteller , far beneath the notice of magical creatures . I did n't think that the ice women would concern themselves with my doings . Still , I followed Sarasri 's advice that night . I closed the shutters not to keep out the ice women , but rather to keep out the cold . Unfortunately the wooden shutters were warped . Though I closed them as tightly as I could , a cold draft blew through the gap between them . <p> I did not sleep well . I could hear the glacier groaning and creaking as the ice shifted and moved . I was glad when the first light of dawn crept through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my mother , who slept soundly beside me . <p> Quietly , I dressed and went down to the street . The weather had grown colder and the rocky paths were slick with frost . At a baker 's shop I bought sweet buns for our breakfast . The buns were warm against my hands as I carried them back to our room . <p> When I entered the room , I called to my mother to wake her , but she did not move . I shook her , and still she did not wake . " Mother , " I called to her . " Mother ? " <p> She would not wake up . I found Sarasri in the kitchen and she sent a boy to find a healer . I sat by my mother 's side , breakfast forgotten . <p> The healer , an old woman with white hair , sat on the edge of my mother 's bed and felt my mother 's cheek . She held a silver spoon beneath my mother 's nose and watched to see that my mother 's breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called to her . Then she shook her head and said , " Ice sickness . " <p> I stared at her . " What do you mean ? " <p> " It comes from the wind off the glacier , " Sarasri said . She frowned unhappily . " That 's what comes of telling tales about the women of the ice . " <p> " Those who get the ice sickness sleep peacefully until they waste away , " the healer said . <p> I stared at my mother . Her face was so calm and peaceful in sleep . It was hard to believe that anything was amiss . " What can I do ? " <p> " There is one cure , " the healer said . <p> " What is it ? " I asked . <p> " Three drops of dragon 's blood . Place them in her mouth and they 'll warm her back to life . " The healer shrugged . " But we have no dragon 's blood and no hero to fetch it for us . " <p> Sarasri shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , " she said . " How many have journeyed to Dragon 's Gate , filled with pride and noble plans ? Not a one has returned . " <p> " Do you have to be a hero to fetch dragon 's blood ? " I asked . " We only need three drops of blood . The dragon does n't have to die to give up three drops . " <p> Sarasri frowned but the old healer nodded . " That 's true , " she said . " Slaying the dragon is not necessary , if you can get a bit of blood by some other means . " She studied me . Her eyes were a brilliant blue , unfaded by her years . " Do you know anything about dragons ? " she asked me . <p> " Only what I have learned from heroic tales , " I said . " And that 's not much . The dragon usually dies as soon as the prince shows up . " The old woman nodded . " Those tales are about princes , not about dragons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wings . " <p> " Is that wrong ? " I asked . <p> " It is not so much wrong as it is incomplete . The essence of a dragon is not in its appearance , but in its nature . " <p> " What is its nature ? " <p> " A dragon is an inferno of anger , blazing with fury , exploding with pain . A dragon is a beast of fire and passion , feeding on fear and hatred . " The old woman stood and drew her woolen cloak around her shoulders . " Approached with fear , a dragon responds with fire . " <p> " What if one does not approach with fear ? " I asked . She shrugged . " A difficult task to accomplish , " she said . " But if it could be done , you might manage to start a conversation . I have heard that dragons like to talk . But they can smell a liar and that awakens their anger . Never lie to a dragon . " <p> PERHAPS THIS IS WHERE the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to Dragon 's Gate and return with three drops of blood from the dragon who had guarded the pass for the past hundred years . <p> I arranged for Sarasri to care for my mother . I left the pony in Sarasri 's stables , since the way ahead was too rough and steep for the animal . Then I followed a footpath that led high into the hills . <p> Dragon 's Gate was once known as Takla 's Pass , named after King Takla , who married the ice woman . This mountain pass offered the shortest route from the lowlands to the trading cities on the Northern Sea . Long ago , caravans laden with carpets and spices and gems made their way through the mountains along this road . King Takla - and after him Takla 's son , King Rinzen - charged merchants for safe passage . <p> All that changed a hundred years ago when good King Belen of the lowlands had , at the urging of rich merchants , sought to overthrow King Rinzen and put an end to his tolls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dragon released by some black magic drove back his army and closed the pass . <p> The dragon laid waste to the land . What had once been a thriving kingdom became a barren deserted land . Merchants from the lowlands banded together to offer a reward to any who could slay the dragon and open the road through the pass . But all the heroes who tried to win the reward perished in the attempt : burned by the dragon 's fire , slashed by the dragon 's claws . <p> Now merchants sent their goods through the desert and around the mountains to the south , a long and perilous journey . In the desert , bandits preyed on caravans and kidnapped merchants for ransom . But the possibility of being waylaid by bandits was better than the certainty of being killed by the dragon . <p> The path I took to Dragon 's Gate was little better than a goat path . Winter avalanches had covered sections of the old trade route . Prickly shrubs had grown over the old road , and no one had cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ' hard travel to Dragon 's Gate . The villages grew smaller and meaner as I traveled . People along the way asked me where I was going - and shook their heads grimly when they heard of my mission . " Turn back , young man , " they said . " You have n't a chance of succeeding . " <p> The last village before the dragon 's pass was little better than a collection of grimy huts clinging to the side of the mountain . There a tiny teahouse doubled as an inn . Three shepherds sat by the fire in the common room , dining on lentil stew , fried bread , and tea . <p> The innkeeper was a stout man with an impressive mustache and a head of hair as thick as the wool on the mountain sheep . " Are you lost ? " he asked me . " There is nowhere to go on this trail . " <p> I explained my mission . he served me dinner and sat with me while I ate . <p> " You say you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you do that ? Only a fool would not fear the dragon . " <p> It was a good question . As I climbed the mountain trails , I had been thinking about how to quell my fear . <p> " Some of the stories that I tell are very frightening , " I told the innkeeper . " But I am not afraid when I tell these tales because I know they will end well . What I am doing now is worthy of a story . If I think of this as a story I am telling , I will not be afraid . " <p> The innkeeper frowned . " But you do n't know that there will be a happy ending to this story of yours . " <p> " Of course there will be , " I said . " I am telling the story , remember ? Why would I tell my own story with an unhappy ending ? " <p> The innkeeper shook his head . " It sounds like you are just fooling yourself . " <p> I nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away fear ? " <p> The innkeeper shook his head and poured me another cup of tea . He spent the rest of the evening telling me of heroes who went to slay the dragon and never returned . <p> When I left the village the next morning , I did my best to put this conversation out of my mind . It was n't easy . Above me loomed the barren crags of Dragon 's Gate . Black rocks , like pointed teeth , made sharp silhouettes against the blue sky . One outcropping bore a resemblance to a standing man . That , it was said , was all that remained of King Takla . <p> Late in the afternoon , I reached the ice field that surrounded the castle where the dragon lived . Over the years , the glacier had flattened the walls that surrounded the castle gardens and had engulfed the outbuildings . The castle 's outer walls had collapsed under the pressure of the ice , but the castle keep , the structure 's central fortress , still stood . One tall tower rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower was as big as my thumb , held at arm 's length . <p> Cautiously I started across the ice fields toward the tower . I used my walking stick to test each patch of ice before trusting my weight to it . Once , the ice collapsed beneath my stick , sending up a spray of snow as it fell . At my feet , where my next step would have taken me , was a crevasse so deep that the bottom was lost in blue light and shadows . The crash of the ice shelf hitting the bottom of the crevasse reverberated through the glacier . <p> The wind cut through my cloak ; I could not stop shivering . At first , my feet ached with the cold . After a time , they became numb . I thought about how it would feel to lie down on the ice , like the ice woman in the story of King Takla . It would be painful at first , but then I would grow numb . I could rest , sleeping as peacefully as my mother slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light that reflected from cracks deep in the ice was the same beautiful blue . In my weariness , I grew dizzy . Looking up at the sky seemed much the same as gazing down into the ice . My walking stick slipped and I stumbled , falling full length onto the ice . I turned over on my back to look up at the blue sky , grateful to be resting . <p> I thought about staying there , just for a while . But that would not do . <p> No tavern crowd would pay good money to hear about a hero who gave up and lay down in the snow . So I got up and kept walking on feet that felt like wood . <p> At last , I reached the tower and circled it , looking for a way in . Halfway around , I discovered a gap in the tower wall . I ducked through the gap and found myself on an ice-slicked stairway . Narrow slits in the walls let in just enough light to reveal the stone steps . Beneath the layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held torches . The walls were marked with soot where flames had licked the stone . <p> Though the castle walls blocked the wind , it was even colder in the castle than it had been outside . My teeth chattered ; I could not stop shivering . I climbed the stairs slowly , taking care not to slip on the icy steps . <p> At the top of the stairs was a wide corridor . The walls were clear of ice and the air felt a little warmer . Looking down the corridor , I could see a glimmer of golden light , spilling from an open doorway . I walked toward it . <p> In the doorway , I stopped and stared , my heart pounding . I could feel fear scratching at the edges of my awareness , but I reminded myself that there would be a happy ending . There had to be a happy ending . <p> The dragon slept in the center of the great hall . The beast lay on what had once been a fine carpet - now tattered and scorched . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat radiating from the beast , like the warmth from a banked fire . <p> To hold fear at bay , I stared at the dragon and imagined how I might describe the monster when I told this story . The dragon 's body was like that of a terrible lizard , a lizard as large as a warhorse . Its wings - great leathery wings - stretched over its back . Its eyes were closed . Its mighty head rested on its front talons . I did not stare for too long at the dragon 's jaws and powerful talons . Instead , I considered the rest of the room and decided how best to describe it when I was telling this story in a tavern . <p> This had once been a magnificent hall . The walls were dark with soot , but I could see paintings beneath the layer of grime . More than a hundred years ago , artists had decorated these walls . On the wall to my left , two men in hunting garb shot arrows at mountain goats , which were bounding away up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wall was painted with mountain landscape - the same mountain that lay outside the castle . But the artist had worked in a warmer and happier time . In the painting , wildflowers grew among the gray stones . <p> In the painting , the stones of the mountain formed a natural cave at the level of the floor . The rocks of the painted cave blended with the very real rocks of a great fireplace , large enough to hold a roasting ox . <p> Beside that fireplace , a skeleton sat slumped in a carved oak chair . A golden crown rested on the skull . Tatters of rich fabric clung to the bones . They fluttered in the breeze that blew through a large break in the wall to my right . <p> That wall had been shattered and its painting with it . I tried to imagine the blow that had shattered the wall , sending the stones tumbling inward and leaving a hole big enough to let the dragon pass through . Through the gap , I could see the glacier far below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . I shivered in the cool breeze . <p> " I smell an enemy , " a voice growled . <p> I looked at the dragon . The beast had not moved , but its eyes were open now . They glowed like the embers of a fire . Colors shifted and flickered in their depths : gold and red and blue . " I know you are an enemy because you stink of the lowlands . You are n't a prince . You are n't a hero . What are you , and why have you come here ? " <p> Be honest , I thought . Dragons can spot a liar . " A humble storyteller , " I said . <p> " A storyteller ? " The dragon lifted its head and studied me with glowing eyes . " How unusual . For the past hundred years , all my visitors have come to kill me . They march up the road from the lowlands with their soldiers following behind and their fear wakes me . I feel the shivering in their souls , the hatred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire flares in response . And I shake off sleep and rise to do battle . " <p> The dragon yawned , revealing a terrifying array of teeth . The beast stretched slowly , shaking out its great golden wings with a leathery rustle . Then the monster regarded me once again . " But you 're not a hero . You are dressed as a boy , but I know by your smell that you are a girl . You are afraid , but not so very afraid . And you want something from me . What is it you want ? Tell me , girl of the lowlands , why I should n't roast your bones with a single breath ? " <p> As a storyteller , I have learned that everyone has a story . Not only that , but everyone has a story that they think should be told . <p> " I have a few reasons for coming here , " I said carefully . " As a storyteller , I know many tales in which there are dragons . But those are stories about princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies at the end of the tale . That does n't seem right . I thought you might help me to tell a new sort of tale about dragons . " <p> " Very tricky , " said the dragon . " You hope to appeal to my vanity . And I notice that you said you had a few reasons and then you told me only one . You hope to intrigue me so that I 'll decide you are interesting enough to spare . " <p> When an audience catches you out , I have found it is best to acknowledge that they are right . If you deny it , they 'll turn against you . " Have I succeeded ? " I asked . <p> " Perhaps . " The dragon continued to study me . " As long as I find you interesting , I will let you live . If I grow bored , I will roast you before I return to sleep . For now , I will spare you because you remind me of a wild girl I once knew . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that wild girl ? She was a lovely princess , until I destroyed her . " <p> Not an entirely promising start . I reminded the dragon of a princess that it had destroyed . But at least the beast was not going to roast me immediately . <p> Though the heat radiated by the dragon had warmed me , my legs were trembling with weariness . I took a chance and asked , " Might I come in and sit while you tell the tale ? " <p> The dragon stared at me , and for a moment I thought all was lost . Then the monster opened its jaws in a terrible grin . " Of course . I have forgotten the duties of a host . Come in . Sit down . There . " The dragon lifted a talon and gestured to a bench beside the chair where the skeleton sat . <p> I crossed the room and sat on the bench , putting my pack on the stone floor beside me . <p> " You look cold , " the dragon said . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mouth and a blast of fire shot into the fireplace beside me . The half-burned logs , remnants of a long-dead fire , blazed . <p> " Alas , I have no food and drink to offer you , " the dragon said . " The kitchens were crushed by the glacier long ago . " <p> I opened my pack and took out a metal flask filled with brandy . " I have a bit of brandy . It 's not the best , but I would be happy to share . " <p> The dragon 's toothy grin widened . " You drink and I will talk . I will tell the storyteller a story . " <p> I sipped from the flask and felt the warmth of the brandy fill my throat and my chest . <p> " The wild girl was a princess , " the dragon said . " A wild mountain princess more likely to be found hunting bandits than working her embroidery . " The beast cocked its head , regarding me thoughtfully . " Tell me , what do you know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my words carefully . " I know of King Takla , who built this castle and captured an ice woman for his queen . " <p> " Very good , " the dragon said . " Then you recognize that horn ? " <p> I followed the dragon 's gaze and saw a silver hunting horn , lying on the stone floor beside the royal skeleton . " King Takla 's horn ? " I asked . <p> " The very same . Blow it and the ice woman will grant your wish . But you must be very careful what you wish for . " <p> I stared at the instrument in amazement . Though I had often told the story of King Takla , I had never thought about what happened to the horn . <p> " The wild princess of my story was the granddaughter of King Takla . Her father , King Rinzen , was the ruler of this mountain kingdom . He was a good king , noble and wise . Do you know of him ? " <p> " I have heard of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized the wealth of King Rinzen and how unfair his tolls had been . <p> " What have you heard ? " <p> " Far less than I wish to know . Far less than you could tell me . " <p> " An evasive answer , " the dragon said , studying me with those great glowing eyes . " You know , I have heard that storytellers are all liars . " <p> " Not necessarily liars , " I said . " But careful in choosing the right audience for a tale . " <p> " And I am not the right audience for the lowland tales of King Rinzen , " the dragon said . <p> I nodded . <p> " Very well . Then I will tell you a tale that you do n't hear in the lowlands . " <p> I tipped back my flask and took a swallow of brandy , grateful to have survived this long . <p> " The men and women of King Rinzen 's court hunted in the hills sometimes for wild goat for the king 's table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravans . Decades before , King Takla had driven away the worst of the bandit gangs . But keeping the pass free of robbers and rogues required constant vigilance . You know of all this , of course . " <p> I shook my head . None of the stories told in the lowlands talked about the bandits that King Takla and King Rinzen had driven off . In the lowland tales , these two kings were accounted as no better than bandits themselves . <p> " I could tell you many fine stories about bandits , about their hidden treasures , their secret caves . But that will have to wait . Just now , I was telling you about King Rinzen 's court . The king was fond of musicians and storytellers . Many came to the castle to perform for the court . In this very hall , minstrels played and bards told tales of adventure , while the king listened and rewarded them handsomely for their art . " <p> The dragon paused and I thought the beast might have lost the thread of the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The dragon turned its gaze back to me , eyes narrowing . " I suggest that you let me tell this story in my own way , " the beast growled . <p> " Of course , " I said hastily . " As you wish . I just wondered about the princess . " <p> " Yes , Princess Tara . One summer evening , Princess Tara came home late from an afternoon of hawking . She knew that a troupe of performers from the lowlands had come to entertain the king . They had come from the court of King Belen , sent by him to King Rinzen . That evening , there was to be a gala performance , but Tara was weary from the hunt . She sent her apologies to her father the king and she did not go to the court that evening . She dined on bread and cheese in her chambers , and went to her bed early . <p> " That night she woke to the screams of women and the clash of steel . " The dragon 's eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She pulled on her clothes and ran into the corridor . It was dark except for the glow of smoldering straw . A torch had fallen , igniting the straw that was strewn on the stone floor . " <p> " What did she do ? " I asked . <p> " She listened in the darkness . Someone was running toward her , scattering the burning straw beneath his feet . In the dim light , she recognized a young bard who had come to the castle a week before . His eyes were wild ; he was bleeding from a cut over his eye . <p> " ' What is happening ? ' Tara called to him . " <p> ' " Treachery , ' he gasped . ' Belen 's men are in the castle . There is fighting in the great hall . ' Then he ran on , and he was gone . <p> " Tara rushed through the darkness , hurrying toward the great hall . There , the torches cast a crimson light over a terrible scene . The air was thick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumped in the big oak chair by the fire . He had been stabbed in the back . By the door were more dead men - some were castle guards , some were men clad in minstrel garb . The festive cloak of one of the minstrels had been torn by a sword stroke , and Tara could see armor beneath the velvet . " <p> The dragon fell silent . I stared at the skeleton in the chair by the fireplace . King Rinzen , still wearing his crown in death . <p> " What had happened ? " I asked at last . <p> " Belen 's troupe of performers was a troop of assassins . They had killed the king , fought the guard , and opened the gates to the soldiers outside . <p> " Tara ran to her father 's side . She kissed his cold cheek and vowed that she would take revenge for what had happened that night . On the wall above the fireplace hung King Takla 's great silver hunting horn , the gift of the ice woman . It had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one had been bold enough to risk blowing it again . An object of beauty , power , and danger , it hung on the wall above the fireplace . <p> " Tara could hear the tramping of boots and the rattle of armor in the corridor . Her father was dead and Belen 's men had taken the castle . Tara pushed a bench to a spot near the fire and stood on the bench to take down the horn . " <p> I nodded , realizing with a shiver that I was sitting on that very bench . <p> The dragon continued , its voice low . " Tara put the horn to her lips and blew , sounding a high clear note that echoed from the stone walls . The wall of the tower cracked and crumbled . A wind from the ice fields blew through the breach in the wall . Through the opening , Tara could see the dark sky above and the pale ice below . A blue light rose from the glacier and flew to the tower . A tall woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you awakened me ? ' the woman asked . " <p> " The ice woman , " I said . <p> " Tara 's great-grandmother , the mother of the maiden that Takla had stolen , " the dragon said . " Tara met the woman 's icy gaze . ' I need your aid , ' the princess said . ' Belen 's men have killed my father . ' <p> " ' What do you want of me ? ' the ice woman said . <p> " ' I want the power to kill my enemies and drive them from our land . I want the strength to avenge my father . ' <p> ' " Power and strength and passion , ' the woman murmured . ' Death and vengeance . These are dangerous things and you are so young . ' <p> " ' Tara fell to her knees before the woman . ' You must help me . ' <p> " The woman touched Tara 's cheek . Tara could feel her tears freezing at the ice woman 's touch . <p> " ' I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Your heart will become ice ; your passion , fire . And then you will have the power you need . But it troubles me to cast this spell on one so young . So I will also tell you how to break the spell and return to yourself . When the tears of your enemy melt the ice of your heart , you will become yourself once again . Until then , you will have your wish . ' <p> " The woman 's cold touch moved to Tara 's breast , a searing chill that took her breath away . The woman stepped back . ' Now you will take the shape you need . You are filled with fire and passion , anger and pain . Let those dictate your form . You will have the power you seek and I will return to sleep . ' <p> " The sorrow that had filled Tara at her father 's death left her when her heart froze at the woman 's touch . Rage and the desire for vengeance filled her . <p> " Transformation came with burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing spasm as her back stretched , the bones creaking as they changed shape . Her jaws lengthened ; her teeth grew sharp . Hands became claws . " The dragon stretched its wings . Its claws flexed , making new tears in the carpet on which it lay . " Tara became a dragon , " the beast said . <p> I stared at the dragon . <p> " Her breath was flame , " Tara said . " Her scales shone like the coals of a fire , shifting and changing with each passing breeze . Now deep red , brighter than fresh blood ; now flickering gold ; now shining blue-white , like the heart of a flame . " As the dragon spoke , her scales flickered and glowed . <p> " She spread her wings and flew , swooping low over the soldiers in the road . She opened her terrible jaws and her rage became a blast of fire . The men broke and ran . The horses , mad with fear , trampled the men as they fled . The soldiers died - so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish between one fleeing figure and another . Belen 's men burned in her flames , but so did people of her own castle . Stableboys and chambermaids , peasants and noblemen , fleeing Belen 's men , fleeing the monster in the sky . " <p> The dragon fell silent for a moment , then continued softly . " Now I live here in the castle . For a hundred years , I have lived here . Sometimes , heroes come to slay me - and I kill them instead . " The dragon studied me with glowing eyes . I stared back , imagining what it would be like to be imprisoned in the body of a monster . <p> " Sometimes , my rage dies down , like a fire that is banked . But then someone filled with hate and fear stirs those ashes and the fire returns , as hot as ever . <p> " Now it is your turn , humble storyteller . Tell me a story and I will decide what to do with you . " <p> I met the dragon 's steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " I said . " This is not a story I would ordinarily tell , since most audiences favor stories about princes and dragons over stories about storytellers . But I think you will find it interesting . This story begins in a mountain town , one week ago . The town was having its harvest festival , and I traveled there with my mother . " <p> I told her the story that you have already heard - about the inn on the edge of the glacier , about my mother 's illness , about the healer who explained that three drops of dragon 's blood would cure my mother of the illness inflicted by the ice woman . " Hope is what brings me here , " I said . " Hope is what keeps me from fear and hatred . " <p> The dragon 's glowing eyes did not waver . " So you hope to slay me and take my blood ? " the dragon rumbled . <p> " Slay you ? " I laughed . The dragon stared at me , but it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brandy and the dragon had n't killed me yet . The idea that I planned to slay the dragon was so ridiculous that I could n't help laughing . I pulled my dagger from my belt . The blade was half as long as one of the dragon 's talons . " I suppose I planned to chop off your head with this ? " I shook my head . " I 'm no dragon slayer . " <p> I thought of my mother 's warm smile , of her honest heart . If only she could be here instead of me . She would smile and the dragon would know that this was a woman worth helping . " I had hoped that you might help my mother . That was all I hoped . " <p> " Hope , " the dragon repeated , her voice softening . " I remember feeling hope when I was human . " The dragon 's gaze moved from my face to the gap in the wall . " As a lowlander , you are my enemy . But it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me of much that I had forgotten , over the passing years . " <p> I glanced through the breach in the wall . A thin crescent Moon had risen over the glacier . The crackling fire in the fireplace beside me had burned to embers . While drinking brandy and talking with the dragon , I had lost track of time . It was nearly dawn . <p> " You came to me for help , " she said . " What more will you do to save your mother ? What will you give me in return for three drops of precious blood ? " <p> I spread my hands . " What would you have me do ? " <p> The dragon did not blink . " In memory of the wild girl that I once was , I will give you three drops of blood . But you must return after you take my blood to your mother . You must come back and keep me company for a time . Will you do that ? " <p> " Yes , " I said , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my mother is well , I will return . " <p> " Very well then , " the dragon said , holding out a taloned paw . <p> I took a small metal vial from my pack . I reached out and took the dragon 's talon in my hand . The scales burned against my skin . With my dagger , I pierced the scaly hide and let three drops of blood fall into the vial . They sizzled as they struck the metal . <p> " You have a long journey ahead of you , " the dragon said . " You 'd do well to rest before you begin . " <p> As if I could sleep with a dragon at my side . Still , it did not seem wise to argue . I lay down on the carpet between the dragon and the embers of the fire . I pillowed my head on my pack , and closed my eyes . Weary from my long journey , drunk with brandy and success , I slept for a time . <p> When I woke , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . As quietly as I could , I left the great hall and headed down the mountain . <p> I will spare you the account of my journey back to my mother 's side . Suffice it to say that everyone along the trail was startled to see me , amazed to hear that I had succeeded in my quest . <p> At last , I reached the inn where my mother slept . Sarasri was astonished to see me . Though she had never believed that I would return , the good woman had been true to her promise . She had taken care of my mother . Pale and thin , my mother slept peacefully in the room where she had been stricken with the ice sickness . <p> Sarasri summoned the healer , and the old woman came to my mother 's chambers . The healer smiled when she saw me . <p> " Three drops of dragon 's blood , " I said , holding out the vial . <p> " Very good , " she said . <p> " Did you slay the dragon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook my head . " The dragon told me a story and I told the dragon a story . The dragon gave me this blood on the condition that I return to Dragon 's Gate when my mother is well . " <p> The healer nodded . " Ah , " she said , " you may very well have slain the dragon then . " <p> I stared at the old woman . " I did not . She gave me this blood freely . " <p> " Indeed - she gave it to you as an act of friendship . And that itself may slay the dragon . Dragons feed on hatred and fear . Acting out of love will weaken the beast . " <p> " This act of kindness weakened the dragon ? " I said . " That 's not fair . " <p> " Hate and fear nourish and strengthen a dragon . Love and friendship erode that strength . Fair or not , it 's the way things work . " She shrugged . " The next hero may find an easy kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going to Dragon 's Gate . But that is no concern of yours . " <p> The old woman took the vial of blood . Her touch was cold on my hand . Gently , she stroked my mother 's hair , then wet my mother 's lips with the dragon 's blood . <p> As I watched , the color returned to my mother 's cheeks . My mother parted her lips , sighed , then opened her eyes and blinked at me . " Al , " she murmured . " It must be past breakfast time . I 'm ravenous . " <p> Sarasri clapped her hands together and hurried off to fetch food . I held my mother 's hands , cold in my grip at first , then warming - and I told her all that had happened . She feasted on scones and fresh milk . And when I thought to look around for the healer , the old woman was gone . <p> My mother recovered quickly . By the evening , she was out of bed . By the next morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that I had to return to the dragon 's castle as soon as possible . The healer 's words had left me uneasy . My mother was captivated by the dragon 's story , and she said that she would go with me . With some effort , I persuaded her that it was more important that she write a ballad that told Tara 's tale . <p> At last I prevailed . But not before I found out more information about Prince Dexter and his plans . <p> Erland was a kingdom to the north - a small , cold , barren place . Its population lived by fishing and hunting the great whales that lived in the Northern Seas . Princes were as common as fish heads in Erland . ( The king of Erland was a virile man . ) Prince Dexter , the youngest of the king 's eight sons , had left Erland to seek his fortune . <p> A group of merchants in the lowlands had offered Dexter a great reward if he would slay the dragon . From the merchants ' point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the prince failed , it cost them nothing . If he succeeded , the dragon 's death opened an easy route to the trading ports and Dexter 's reward would be nothing compared to the fortunes they would make . <p> From the prince 's point of view - well , I confess , I do not understand the prince 's point of view . It seems to me that there are easier ways to make your fortune than attempting to slay a dragon that has killed many heroes . But princes are raised on stories in which the dragon always dies . Like me , the prince believed in a happy ending . <p> Knowing that the prince would soon be going to Dragon 's Gate , I set out on the trail . It was a long , difficult journey - though not as difficult as it had been the first time . It was not as cold as it had been before . As I climbed the pass to reach the castle , I saw a few wildflowers blooming among the gray stones of the mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from my high vantagepoint and saw soldiers riding up the trail below me . Their banner was green and white , the colors of Erland . <p> I climbed the ice-slicked stairs of the castle and made my way to the great hall . The dragon lay where I had seen her last , stretched out on the tattered rug . But her scales were dull and lusterless . <p> " Tara ! " I said . " Wake up ! " <p> The dragon did not move . I threw myself on her great scaly neck . " Wake up ! " I shouted again . " There is danger here . " <p> I could feel the barest warmth through the scaly hide . The dragon 's breathing was low and shallow . <p> I could hear the tramping of boots and the rattle of armor in the corridor . Prince Erland and his men had caught up with me . " Can you hear them ? " I said . " Can you feel their fear ? Can you feel the hatred in their hearts ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The dragon did not move . <p> The prince stepped into the room . His sword was drawn . For a moment I could not help but see the scene as I might have described it in a tale for the tavern crowd . A handsome prince lifted his sword against a terrible monster . But I could see the scene in another way as well : a beast of unearthly beauty , an enchanted princess enslaved and transformed by her own passion , dying for a kindness that had sapped her strength . <p> I pulled my dagger and stood between the prince and the dragon . The prince looked startled to see me . I could tell by his expression that this was not the way he expected the story to go . I have never heard a story in which anyone tries to protect a dragon . <p> " You must not kill this dragon , " I told him . " She is an enchanted princess . She was weakened because she acted with great kindness . You must not slay her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the sleeping dragon . " I 'm not likely to kiss that . A woman capable of laying waste to a kingdom and driving soldiers before her like sheep is no wife for me . " <p> Clearly he had heard too many stories of princes and enchanted princesses . I had suggested neither a kiss nor a royal wedding . <p> " I think I 'd better just kill the beast , " the prince was saying . " If you do not step aside , I will have to remove you . " <p> I 've told enough stories about princes to know that is what they are trained to do - slay monsters and marry princesses . This prince , like others of his kind , was not a man inclined to change direction quickly . <p> " I will not step aside , " I said , holding out my dagger . <p> The prince was , however , trained to fight . I was not . With a flick of his sword , the prince struck my dagger aside , stepped in , twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . Then he lifted his sword . <p> I fell on the dragon 's neck so that the prince could not strike the sleeping dragon without striking me . " Wake up , " I murmured to Tara , my eyes filling with tears . It was too much ; it was not fair . " You must save yourself . " My tears spilled over , dropping onto the beast 's neck , trickling over the dull scales . <p> Where the tears touched , the scales shone with a new brilliance , a blue-white light so bright it dazzled my eyes . The dragon shuddered beneath me . I released my hold on her neck , scrambling away . <p> The brilliant light - ten times brighter than sunlight on the ice fields - enveloped the dragon . I squinted through my tears at the light . I could see a shadow in the glare , a dark shape that changed as I strained to see what it was . <p> The light faded , and I blinked , my eyes still dazzled . A woman stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacial ice . Her hair was the color of flames . She was dressed in an old-fashioned hunting tunic and breeches . Her hand was on the sword at her belt , and I was certain that she knew how to use it . Much experience with bandits , I suspected . <p> TARA SAT BY THE FIRE that the soldiers had built , watching the flames . <p> " Of course , you can claim your reward , " I told the prince . " The merchants asked that you do away with the dragon - and you achieved that end . Your men can testify to it : The dragon is gone . " <p> " That 's true , " the prince agreed . <p> " It is the way the story had to go , " I explained to the prince . " My tears melted the ice in her heart and she returned to her true form . " <p> " And now what happens ? " The prince was studying Tara thoughtfully . <p> Tara turned from contemplating the fire and met his gaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the dragon gone , my people will return . " She smiled . " It will take time , but there 's no rush . " <p> " You will need help , " the prince said . " Such a lovely princess should not rule alone . Perhaps .... " <p> " Perhaps you should remember your own thoughts , as you prepared to slay a dragon , " Princess Tara said , still smiling . " A woman capable of laying waste to a kingdom and driving soldiers before her like sheep is no wife for you . " <p> She turned her gaze back to the fire . " My people will return , and so will the bandits . We will hunt the bandits in the hills and the merchants will pay a toll to pass this way . " <p> " Perhaps you 'd best not tell the merchants that part just yet , " I advised the prince . Is the story done yet ? Not quite . There is still King Takla 's horn to account for . That evening , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a flash of blue light over the ice , and then a beautiful woman wrapped in a white shawl stood before me . Her eyes looked familiar - a beautiful , piercing blue . Her hair was white , and she smiled with recognition when she saw me . <p> " You have called me , " the ice woman said . " What do you wish ? " <p> I held out the horn . " Only to return this horn , " I said . " Nothing more . " <p> The ice woman studied me . " No other wishes ? You do not wish for wealth or fame or glory ? " <p> I smiled and shook my head . <p> " You dress as a man , yet you are a woman . Would you wish to be a man ? " <p> I thought about Princess Tara , a woman who hunted for bandits and claimed her own kingdom , and shook my head . " I have no wish to make , " <p> I said . Then I asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " She was pleased to return to her home . " <p> I nodded . " Of course she would be . " <p> " How is your mother ? " the ice woman asked . <p> " Doing well . Writing a ballad about Tara . " <p> She took the horn from my extended hand . " You did very well , " she said then . " I am glad that you could help my great-granddaughter , Tara . " <p> I bowed to her . " I am grateful to have been of service . " When I looked up , she was gone . <p> I returned to Sarasri 's inn in Nabakhri , where my mother waited . I reached the inn early in the afternoon . I went looking for my mother and found her in the kitchen . Sarasri was kneading bread and my mother was playing the harp and keeping her company . <p> The kitchen was warm . A pot of lamb stew bubbled on the fire . The yeasty scent of bread filled the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw me . My mother abandoned her music and hugged me . Sarasri heaped lamb stew in a bowl and insisted that I eat it all . <p> " My wonderful child , " my mother said . " You must tell us all that has happened since you left here . " <p> I shook my head , my mouth filled with stew . " Tonight , " I said , " I will tell the tale tonight . " <p> The tavern was full that night . People had heard of my mother 's illness , of my trip to Dragon 's Gate and my return with dragon 's blood , of my return to Dragon 's Gate to keep my promise . <p> I smiled at the crowd . Dressed in tunic and breeches , returning in triumph from Dragon 's Gate , I knew the story that they expected . It was the story of Al , a heroic young man who confronts a monster . <p> " My name is Alita , " I said . " And that means ' a girl to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think that I am a young man . But the world is filled with illusions - as I learned when I met the dragon . Let me tell you my story . " <p> Author Affiliation
