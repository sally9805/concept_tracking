New York , 1821 Damian needed money . Lots of it . Ironic , really , that he , a duke , with his coffers of gold back home in England , should find himself a virtual beggar on the streets of New York . But when had fate ever been kind to him ? Wending through the bustling city port , the duke passed jeering sailors and vulgar wenches alike , making his way to the nearest gaming hell . A few coins in his pocket , he intended to amass a small fortune . And he could do it , too . Years of debauchery had prepared him for just such an endeavor . But unlike his former besotted self , he was sober now . With all his wits intact , Damian hoped to recoup as much of his wealth as he could . His ship was in dire need of repairs , and the crew would not follow him in exchange for bread crumbs . He needed blunt . Damian came to a halt . Neptune 's Revenge . It was aptly named , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking revenge at sea . And he was in desperate need of good luck . A shoddy hole christened after the wrathful sea king seemed the perfect place to find it . But a nearby scuffle distracted the duke -- and made the blood pound in his veins . " Admit it , kid , you were cheatin ' . " The horde , five in total , circled the so-called kid , a strapping young buck sporting a cheeky grin , who quipped , " Me cheat ? " He snorted . " Sorry , Yanks . ' Fraid we Brits are just unbeatable . " Damian blinked . The kid disappeared under a pummel of fists . Yet it was not the brutal thrashing that stirred the frantic rage in Damian 's gut . It was the kid . He recognized the kid . It was Adam ! With a roar , Damian launched right into the fray and did a little pounding of his own . He had to save Adam ! One thug staggered off with a bleeding nose , another stumbled away with a broken arm . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shots rang out . The kid was hit in the arm with a bullet . Whistles blowing , pistols flailing , the authorities rounded up the lot of them . And it was then Damian looked down at the kid , curled in a dusty heap , and realized the boy was not Adam . He only looked like Adam . Stunned by his visceral response , Damian could not say a word when the authorities snapped the shackles over his wrists . What the devil had come over him ? Carted off to the nearest gaol , Damian was tossed inside the brig , the kid his cellmate , and for three days he suffered imprisonment . Three miserable , dull days . And all the while he sat chained in the corner , brooding . Woeful thoughts interrupted , Damian glanced down at the kid -- Quincy was his name -- groaning and stirring on the clump of hay . And try as he might to ignore the chap 's distress , Damian could not . Bloody hell . With each passing day , he grew more and more sentimental . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in disgust , Damian propped his manacled wrists under the lad 's chest and pushed . Quincy rolled over , hacking , and brought his forearm to his eyes to block the shaft of moonlight resting on his face . He was like a ghost , so pale and sluggish , and Damian could feel that galling worry creeping into his chest again . " Wake up ! " he ordered , kicking the kid in the leg for good measure . " You 'll die if you sleep any more . " " Bollocks , " came the weak but stubborn protest . " And I 'll draw your cork if you kick me again . " Damian snorted . The lad did n't have the strength to roll over , but he was going to break Damian 's nose ? The duke had to admire the kid 's spirit , but still , it was not enough to save the chap . An infection had set into the bullet wound , and the boy 's breathing had changed to odd , raspy gasps . " I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goaded the duke , hoping to stir some life back into the weary chap . But Quincy was n't taking the bait . He merely grunted at the suggestion . There was nothing more Damian could do for the kid . The gaol cell , with little food and water , no clean linens , and no surgical instruments , made for a very poor infirmary . Besides , Damian 's medical talent was lackluster at best . After abandoning his castle , leaving the land steward in charge of the estate , he 'd spent the last two years learning to sail , rig a mast , fire a cannon with deadly accuracy . He 'd improved upon his fencing , his aim with a pistol , even his use of a knife . But he had no real use for the healing art . His purpose in life was to destroy : to destroy the piratical fiends who had murdered his brother . Blast it ! He should be out there right now , looking for the brigand swine , instead of playing nursemaid to a troubled buck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wild tempest that had thrashed his ship a few days ago , he would never have limped into port in desperate need of repairs . Repairs , of course , cost money , and since a good chunk of his coin had washed overboard during the squall , money was one thing he did n't have in abundance . At first it seemed a trifle bind . In a safe aboard his ship was a series of credentials , all proclaiming him the duke that he was . He had only to saunter into the nearest bank , present the papers to a pudgy-faced banker , and acquire a loan for as much blunt as he wanted . . . if only the safe had been watertight . Damian had opened the iron door to find his credentials washed clean away , the ink smeared all over the raggedy parchments . And so , adrift in New York harbor with a badly leaking ship and torn sails and scant supplies , he 'd headed into port to win his wealth , leaving behind his lieutenant with the order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
