<p> In 1800 the United States was an underdeveloped nation of just over 5 million people . It was a society shaped by immigration , but immigrants from one country , Great Britain , made up around half the population . Although some pioneers had moved west of the Appalachian Mountains , America was preeminently a seacoast settlement . A prosperous nation , it still lagged far behind England , which was industrializing furiously . And with only 10 percent of its people living in towns and cities , it was thoroughly agrarian . <p> All this was about to change , and the change was sudden , explosive , and deeply disorienting . In the next century , immigration , capitalism , and machine technology would reshape the character , culture , and landscape of the young nation . In 1900 more than 77 million Americans lived in a continental empire that was a melting pot for more than 30 nationalities . Sixty percent of Americans still worked on farms , but nearly 40 percent now lived in cities , and the United States had surpassed England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ... in things of iron and steel that the national genius most freely speaks , " wrote William Dean Howells . <p> The Industrial Revolution was , and still is , the greatest engine of change in the history of humankind . Not surprisingly , it has spawned a literature of interpretation , celebration , and indignation that is a feast for the general reader . <p> With its far-spreading , factorylike environment , nineteenth-century Chicago was a place where writers went to see the machine-age future in all its splendor and squalor . Chicago was the international capital of meatpacking , and in its sprawling stockyards district it was inventing a new way of making things - assembly-line production - that would transform the world . The young socialist Upton Sinclair spent only seven weeks there , but the novel he published in 1906 , The Jungle ( many editions ) , is the most powerful account we have of the new world of industrialized production . On the bloodsoaked floors of these gigantic meat mills , and in the vile slums that rimmed them , immigrants fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of the animals they were paid to kill and cut . ( The novel also contains a spectacular account of the work inside a modern steel mill . ) <p> Sinclair was a Protestant Prohibitionist , and the novel suffers from his narrowly moralistic treatment of immigrant life , his failure to appreciate the roles that the Catholic Church and the neighborhood saloon played in ethnic advancement . In places the book is preachy and bombastic , and many of its characters fail to come to life . Yet it can still be read today as a devastatingly accurate indictment of the failure of America 's buccaneering capitalists to treat their workers as part of the human race . <p> Chicago 's nineteenth-century capitalists were inventing a new type of city as well as a new type of work . Rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1871 , Chicago 's downtown was a technological wonder , its streets lit by electricity , serviced by swift streetcars , lined by solid rows of skyscrapers , and graced by palatial department stores . In Sister Carrie ( 1900 ; many editions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and velocity of this new technological city , along with the consumption culture that department-store magnates like Marshall Field were bringing into being . In the second half of the novel the action shifts to New York City , a bigger , more powerful , and vastly more impersonal place than Chicago . Dreiser 's New York is a city of amplitude and opportunity , but it is also an unforgiving force of nature that ruins as many lives as it elevates , an image evoked by Carrie Meeber and her doomed lover , Hurstwood , one made by the city , the other undone by it . Sister Carrie is America 's Tale of Two Cities , and Dreiser is our Dickens , a wide-awake traveler to what was then an absolutely new world , the turbulent industrial city , its culture nothing short of revolutionary . <p> While young Dreiser was walking the streets of Chicago collecting material for his first novel , a lean , laconic Norwegian-American was hired as an economics instructor at the newly founded University of Chicago . In 1899 Thorstein Veblen published his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : An Economic Study of the Evolution of Institutions ( many editions ) , a caustic dissection of the customs and conventions of America 's new capitalist conquistadors . Like Karl Marx , Veblen exposed the wasteful , self-indulgent lives of a new class of status-driven plutocrats who were fashioning a metropolitan culture of " conspicuous leisure . " But , unlike Marx , he did it with wit and irony and without Marx 's tiresome historical determinism . The Theory of the Leisure Class is Swiftian satire raised to the level of judicious scholarship , a work read enthusiastically by reformers of the time and still a useful guide to the deep-lying motivation of those who spend and display self-indulgently and extravagantly . <p> Dreiser 's Hurstwood ends his life in a rundown hotel on the Lower East Side , site of New York 's foulest slums . In Maggie : A Girl of the Streets , Stephen Crane portrayed these neighborhoods with painful accuracy . But it took the invention of flash photography and the crusading spirit of Jacob Riis , an immigrant himself , to expose this earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Denmark in 1870 at the age of 21 and landed a job as a police reporter eight years later . His beat included Mulberry Bend , the worst neighborhood in New York . In 1890 he published How the Other Half Lives : Studies Among the Tenements of New York ( many editions ) , a book that should be read until urban poverty is abolished . <p> Riis made his readers feel as if they were there , at his elbow , as he took flash photographs with his handheld detective camera . The flash powder exploded with such sudden force that it left many of his subjects with looks of fright or surprise on their faces . Yet some of Riis 's most heart-stabbing photographs are carefully posed shots of street kids and struggling families . Riis was not free of the racial prejudices of his time , but his work - the prose nearly as powerful as the pictures - awoke the conscience of the nation and led to tenement-house reform . <p> An altogether different urban America is described in the work of two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social philosopher Lewis Mumford and the historian David McCullough . In a slim , sparkling book , The Brown Decades : A Study of the Arts in America , 1865-1895 ( 1931 ; Dover ) , Mumford rediscovered a " buried Renaissance " beneath the political corruption and sordid speculation of the Gilded Age , a group of writers , painters , and builders who produced work of integrity and permanency . Among them were Frederick Law Olmsted , Louis Sullivan , Henry Hobson Richardson , Thomas Eakins , Emily Dickinson , and John A. and Washington A. Roebling , builders of the Brooklyn Bridge , " perhaps the most completely satisfactory structure of any kind that had appeared in America . " <p> The Roeblings - father and son - are the heroes of McCullough 's The Great Bridge : The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge ( 1972 ; Simon &; Schuster ) , a magisterial account of the building of the greatly loved East River span . For Mumford and McCullough , the Brooklyn Bridge is a poem of granite and metal , the Chartres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a stupendous engineering achievement , a story McCullough turns into an enthralling family and urban drama . His is the best book about nineteenth-century New York City and one of the masterworks of American scholarship and storytelling . <p> In his novel Poor White ( 1920 ; New Directions ) , Sherwood Anderson tells a darker tale , the betrayal of man by his own machines . It is the story of a small town 's sudden and thoroughgoing transformation by industrial capitalism . The people of Bidwell , Ohio , embrace new laborsaving machines only to see these machines trigger " a long silent war between classes , between those who have and those who ca n't get . " Pre-industrial Bidwell is an impossibly warm and satisfying place , but the characters caught up in the painful process of change - farmers and mechanics , dreamers and entrepreneurs - are expertly etched , with what H. L. Mencken called a " superb reality . " <p> John Dos Passos , in his trilogy U.S.A.

( The novels are The 42nd Parallel , 1919 , and The Big Money . ) Like Veblen , Dos Passos means to " put the acid test to existing institutions , to strip them of their veils . " A novel of failure and despair , of men and women crushed or corrupted by advertising , financial racketeering , and corporate greed , it is , one critic wrote , " one of the saddest books ever written by an American . " It is also the finest historical novel in our literature , a work in which the novelist , to use Henry James 's phrase , succeeds to the " sacred office " of the historian . U.S.A. remains a book for our time because its characters are current - we can recognize all of them - and because we can take inspiration from the outsiders that challenge the anonymity and greed of modern mass society , most of them the kind of people Veblen celebrated in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In The Americans : The Democratic Experience ( 1973 ; Knopf ) , the final volume of his trilogy on the evolution of the American character , the historian Daniel J. Boorstin describes " countless , little-noticed revolutions ... in homes and farms and factories and schools and stores ... so little noticed because they came so swiftly , everywhere and every day . " This is not a history of politics or political ideas . There is nothing on the union movement , feminism , or civil rights . Instead , Boorstin serves up fascinating pocket histories of American plumbing , meatpacking , product packaging , refrigeration , central heating and air conditioning , supermarkets , and myriad other often ignored transformations that shaped our national uniqueness . <p> Boorstin believes that Americans are primarily what they make and buy , that things , not abstract ideas , shape the way we behave . The great part of his trilogy is a celebration of America 's pragmatic , " get-ahead " spirit and the wondrous time- and money-saving inventions it brought into general use , from ready-to-wear clothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume is also a cautionary tale , with a heavy dose of Veblenesque pessimism . Did the very perfection of techniques for democratizing consumption and widening experiences impoverish these very experiences ? Boorstin asks . Today , he writes , most Americans live in rootless , " everywhere communities " eating " all-the-time food , " places stripped of their regional identity and local flavor . Endlessly , sometimes irritatingly , provocative , Boorstin 's work is a landmark of social history that is a pure delight to read . <p> Richard Hofstadter 's The Age of Reform : From Bryan to F.D.R. ( 1955 ; Knopf ) is a perfect complement to Boorstin . It is a book that is almost entirely about ideas - political ideas - and it astutely analyzes the modern reform tradition , from Populism to the New Deal , that Boorstin blithely passes over . The introduction alone is one of the most astute assessments of the American reform impulse ever written , an argument as pertinent today as it was half a century ago . A pervading characteristic of American reformers of both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopianism , an unwillingness to abide anything thought to be evil , whether it be saloons , bigcity machines , or the Communist party . <p> Anticipating Boorstin , Hofstadter argues that this restless reformism is most successful in dealing with " things . ... in technology and invention , in productivity , in the ability to meet needs and provide comforts . In this sphere America has surpassed all other peoples . But in dealing with human beings and institutions , in matters of morals and politics , " it has disabling deficiencies . It leads to moral crusades and to paranoid fears that some single conspiratorial force must be behind every evil and that these evils must be obliterated immediately and forever , not controlled or hemmed in . It is no accident , Hofstadter suggests , that some of the very reformers who broke up corrupt political machines and rapacious trusts imposed Prohibition on a thirsty nation . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Path of Gold , by Jonas Lie , around 1915 . <p> By Donald L.
