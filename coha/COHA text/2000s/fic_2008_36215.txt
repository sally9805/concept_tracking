Barry Laverty  --  Doctor Barry Laverty  --  heard the clattering of a frying pan on a stove and smelled bacon frying . Mrs. " Kinky " Kincaid , Doctor O'Reilly 's housekeeper , had breakfast on , and Barry realized he was ravenous . <br> Feet thumped down the stairs , and a deep voice said , " Morning , Kinky . " <br> " Morning yourself , Doctor dear . " <br> " Young Laverty up yet ? " Despite the fact that half the village of Ballybucklebo , County Down , Northern Ireland , had been partying in his back garden for much of the night , Doctor Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly , Laverty 's senior colleague , was up and doing . <br> " I heard him moving about , so . " <br> Barry 's head was a little woozy , but he smiled as he left his small attic bedroom . He found the Cork woman 's habit of tacking " so " to the ends of most of her sentences endearing and less grating than the " so it is " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his native province of Ulster . <br> In the bathroom he washed the sleep from his blue eyes , which in the shaving mirror blinked at him from an oval face under fair hair , a cowlick sticking up from the crown . <br> He finished dressing and went downstairs to the dining room , passing as he did the ground-floor parlour that Doctor O'Reilly used as his surgery , which Barry knew an American doctor would have called his " office . " He hoped to be spending a lot of time here in the future . He paused to glimpse inside the by now familiar room . <br> " Do n't stand there with both legs the same length , " O'Reilly growled from the dining room opposite . " Come on in and let Kinky feed us . " <br> " Coming . " Barry went into the dining room , blinking at the August sunlight streaming in through the bay windows . <br> " Morning , Barry . " O'Reilly , wearing a collarless striped shirt and red braces to hold up his tweed trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacup held in one big hand . <br> " Morning , Fingal . " Barry sat and poured himself a cup . " Grand day . " <br> " I could agree , " said O'Reilly , " if I did n't have a bit of a strong weakness . " He yawned and massaged one temple , his bushy eyebrows moving closer as he spoke . Barry could see tiny veins in the whites of O'Reilly 's brown eyes . The big man 's craggy face with its cauliflower ears and listing-to-port nose broke into a grin . " When I was in the navy it 's what we used to call ' a self-inflicted injury . ' It was quite the ta-ta-ta-ra yesterday . " <br> Barry laughed and wondered how many pints of Guinness his mentor had sunk the previous night . Ordinarily drink would have as much effect on O'Reilly as a teaspoon of water on a forest fire . Barry still was n't sure if the man 's magnanimous offer , made in the middle of what had seemed to be the hooley to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly was serious . When he 'd first woken he 'd thought he might 've dreamed the whole thing , but now he clearly remembered that he 'd vowed before laying his head on the pillow to muster the courage this morning to ask O'Reilly if he had meant it . <br> He knew he could let the hare sit , wait for O'Reilly to repeat the offer under more professional circumstances , but damn it all , this was important . Barry glanced down at the table , then back straight into O'Reilly 's eyes . " Fingal , " he said putting down his cup . <br> " What ? " <br> " You were serious , were n't you , about offering me a full-time assistantship for one year and then a partnership in your practice ? " <br> O'Reilly 's cup stopped halfway to his lips . His hairline moved lower and rumpled the skin of his forehead . Pallor appeared at the tip of his bent nose . <br> Barry involuntarily turned one shoulder towards the big man , as a pistol duellist of old might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller target . The pale nose was a sure sign that fires smouldering beneath O'Reilly 's crust were about to break through the surface . <br> " Was I what ? " O'Reilly slammed his cup into his saucer . " Was I what ? " <br> Barry swallowed . " I only meant  --  " <br> " Holy thundering mother of Jesus Christ Almighty I know what you meant . Why the hell would you think I was n't serious ? " <br> " Well . . . " Barry struggled desperately to find diplomatic words . " You . . . that is , we . . . we 'd had a fair bit to drink . " <br> O'Reilly pushed his chair away from the table , cocked his head to one side , stared at Barry  --  and began to laugh , great throaty rumbles . <br> Barry looked expectantly into O'Reilly 's face . His nose tip had returned to its usually florid state . The laugh lines at the corners of the big man 's eyes had deepened . <br> " Yes , Doctor Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody well serious . I 'd like you to stay . " <br> " Thank you . " <br> " Do n't thank me . Thank yourself . I 'd not have made you the offer if I did n't think you were fitting in here in Ballybucklebo , and if the customers had n't taken a shine to you . " <br> Barry smiled . <br> " You just keep it up . You hear me ? " <br> " I do . " <br> O'Reilly stood and started to walk round the table until he stood over Barry . O'Reilly stretched out his right hand . " If we were a couple of horse traders we 'd spit on our hands before we sealed the contract , but I think maybe a couple of GPs should forgo that in favour of a simple handshake . " <br> Barry rose and accepted O'Reilly 's clasp , relieved to find it was n't the man 's usual knuckle-crushing version of a handshake . " Thanks , Fingal , " he said . " Thanks a lot and I will try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said O'Reilly , releasing Barry 's hand , " but all this serious conversation has me famished , and I 'm like a bull with a headache until I get my breakfast . Where the hell 's Kinky ? " He turned and started to amble back to his chair . <br> Barry heard a loud rumbling from O'Reilly 's stomach . He did not say , " Excuse me . " Barry had learned that the man never apologized ; indeed his confession of being short-tempered in the morning was the closest Barry knew O'Reilly would get to expressing regret for having roared at Barry moments earlier . The man rarely explained himself and seemed to live entirely by his own set of rules , the first being " Never , never , never let the patients get the upper hand . " <br> Barry heard a noise behind him and turned to see Mrs. Kincaid standing in the doorway . He had n't heard her coming . For a woman of her size she was light on her feet . <br> " You 're ready now for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving into the room , setting a tray on the sideboard , lifting plates , and putting one before O'Reilly and one in front of Barry . " I did n't want to interrupt . I know you 're discussing important things , so . " Her eyes twinkled and she winked at Barry . " But you get carried away sometimes , do n't you , Doctor O'Reilly dear ? I hear that kind of thing is very bad for the blood pressure . " <br> " Get away with you , Kinky . " O'Reilly was grinning at her , but with the kind of look a small boy might give his mother when he knew he 'd been caught out in some peccadillo . <br> Barry turned his attention to his breakfast . On his plate two rashers of Belfast bacon kept an orange-yolked egg company . Half a fried tomato perched on a crisp triangle of soda farl . A pork sausage , two rings of black pudding , and one of white topped off the repast . He felt himself salivate as the steam rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't enough to keep him here , Mrs. Kincaid 's cooking certainly tipped the scales . " Thanks , Kinky , " he said . " When I get through this , I 'll be ready to go and call the cows home . " <br> He saw her smile . " Eat up however little much is in it , and leave the cows to the farmers , so . " She turned to go , her silver chignon catching the sun 's rays as they slipped through the room 's bay window to sparkle in her hair and plant diamonds in the cut-glass decanters on the sideboard . <br> " Thanks , Kinky , " said O'Reilly , tucking a linen napkin into his shirt-neck . He waved his fork . " Begod I could eat a horse , a bloody Clydesdale , saddle and all . " He shoved most of one rasher into his mouth . <br> Barry swallowed a small piece of tomato . <br> O'Reilly speared a piece of black pudding and chewed with what appeared to be the enthusiasm of a famished crocodile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the day without my breakfast . Once I get this into me , I 'll be a new man . " <br> As Barry sliced his bacon he heard the front doorbell , Kinky 's footsteps , and a man 's voice . Kinky reappeared in the dining room . " It 's Archibald Auchinleck , the milkman . " <br> " On a Sunday morning ? " O'Reilly growled through a mouthful of soda farl . <br> " He says he 's sorry , but  --  " <br> " All right , " O'Reilly growled , ripping the napkin from his throat . " Between you making breakfast late with your questions and the patients interrupting it , " he said , eyeing Barry , " I 'll die of starvation . " He stood and walked down past the table . Mrs. Kincaid moved up the other side . The pair of them look like partners in a slip jig , Barry thought . <br> " I 'll pop this back in the oven . Keep it warm , so . " She lifted O'Reilly 's plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roar shattered the morning . <br> " Do you know what bloody day it is , Archibald Auchinleck , you pathetic , primitive , primate ? Do you ? " O'Reilly 's shout made Barry 's teacup rattle . " Answer me , you pitiful , pinheaded parasite . " <br> Barry was glad he was n't on the receiving end . He strained but could n't hear the milkman 's reply . <br> A line echoed in Barry 's head . Never , never , never let the patients . . . <br> " Sunday . Well done . Pure genius . You should get a Nobel Prize for knowing that . Not Monday . Not Friday . Sunday . Now I know what it means in the good book , in Genesis chapter one , verse twenty-five , that on the fifth day God made " every thing that creepeth upon the earth . Relatives of yours , no doubt , Archibald Auchinleck . But what . . . what does it say in chapter two , verse two , about the seventh day ? Tell me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> O'Reilly continued his rant . " It says , and please correct me if I 'm wrong , ' And on the seventh day God ended his work . . . and He rested . ' And what did he do ? " <br> Barry could just make out the reply : " And he rested , sir . " <br> Never , never , never let the patients <br> Barry could hear O'Reilly resuming his diatribe . " Yes , he rested . He bloody well rested . Now tell me , Archibald Auchinleck , if the Good Lord could put his feet up on the Sabbath , why in the hell ca n't I ? What in the name of Jesus H. Christ possessed you to come to annoy me today , Sunday , with a simple backache you 've had for bloody weeks ? " <br> . . . get the upper hand . It might be O'Reilly 's first law of practice , Barry thought , grinning widely , but the corollary , the first law to be obeyed by O'Reilly 's patients , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye with a blunt stick . " <br> O'Reilly 's voice dropped in volume and seemed more placatory . " All right , Archie . All right . Enough said . I know you only get Sundays off from your milk round . It 's probably all the stooping and bending to deliver the bottles that 's giving you gyp , and having a boy in the British army must be a worry . Tell me about your back , and I 'll see what I can do for you . " <br> Barry mopped up some egg yolk with a piece of soda farl . That was O'Reilly in a nutshell , he thought . A temper and a tendency to erupt like a grumbling volcano , wedded to an encyclopaedic knowledge of his patients and a sense of obligation to them that made the oath of Hippocrates sound as trite as a Christmas-cracker motto . <br> Barry pushed his plate away , stood , and looked out through the bow window . It was a beautiful day , and as O'Reilly had said he could have today off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> He intended to enjoy his freedom to the full . Tomorrow would mark the start of his assistantship to Doctor Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly . <br> Copyright 2008 by Patrick Taylor . All rights reserved . <br> <br> Continues ...
