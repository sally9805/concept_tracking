<p> The scar , about four inches above his right ankle , is hardly visible , and when former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann lifts his pantleg , the slight bend in his right leg is barely discernible . Still , they are constant reminders of The Hit That No One Who Saw It Can Ever Forget , the hit that , in ESPN polling , was the runaway winner as the most shocking moment in NFL history . <p> Twenty years ago tonight , in the second quarter of a " Monday Night Football " game between the New York Giants and Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium , linebacker Lawrence Taylor ended Theismann 's NFL career with a tackle that snapped the bones in Theismann 's right leg . <p> " People break legs all the time in football . It involves the cracking of a bone , but most times , you ca n't see it , " said Dan Dierdorf , a Hall of Fame offensive lineman who later became a " Monday Night Football " analyst and was watching the game on TV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when you watch something that 's so far out of the normal , you just gag , but you almost ca n't help watching it again and again . " <p> To this day , Theismann says he has not seen a replay . He said Taylor has told him he has not watched it , either . <p> The Redskins were 5-5 , coming into the game after a loss to Dallas . Although the Giants were 7-3 , Theismann recalled having a hot hand early in the game , completing seven of his first 10 passes . In the second quarter , on a play called in from Coach Joe Gibbs , he had handed off to running back John Riggins , who started toward the line of scrimmage . An instant before Giants linebacker Harry Carson hit Riggins , he wheeled and pitched the ball back to Theismann on a flea flicker pass . <p> " I remember handing the ball to John , getting it back and then looking downfield , " Theismann said in a recent interview . " I could n't find Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tight end Donnie Warren . At that point , I was feeling some pressure , and the next thing I knew , I heard what sounded like a shotgun going off  --  Pow ! Pow !  --  and felt this excruciating pain . Then I was on the ground . " <p> Taylor , a Hall of Fame linebacker , knew immediately after hitting Theismann that the quarterback was in deep trouble . Taylor immediately leaped up and , in a move out of character for football players , frantically signaled to the sideline as he raced toward the Washington bench to get the Redskins ' medical people on the field . <p> Within seconds , the Redskins ' orthopedic surgeon , Charles Jackson , was on the field , along with Gibbs and Redskins trainer Bubba Tyer . <p> " It was at that point , I also found out what a magnificent machine the human body is , " Theismann said . " Almost immediately , from the knee down , all the feeling was gone in my right leg . The endorphins had kicked in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing Bubba being on my left side . I looked at him and said , ' Please call my mom and tell her I 'm okay . ' Joe was kneeling on my right side . He 's looking at me and he says , ' You mean so much to this club , and now you 've left me in one heck of a mess . ' " <p> Theismann 's right leg was mangled . He had a compound fracture of the tibia , meaning the bone had snapped in two , with one end protruding from Theismann 's skin , and a shattered fibula . <p> Tyer recalls that Theismann told him , " Bubba , I 've really done it now , " and that , when he got to him , the quarterback already had a calm about him that he has noticed over the years in many other seriously injured players . " I was on the sidelines with my back to the play trying to reduce someone 's jammed finger , " said Jackson , who had joined the team only about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grabbing me . I had n't seen the play , and when I went out on the field , I looked down at Joe 's leg and his bone was sticking through his sock . Remember , I 've only been doing this for three weeks , and I 'm saying to myself , ' Oh , man , what have I gotten myself into here ? ' " <p> As Jackson and other medical personnel worked on Theismann , Jackson 's primary concern was making certain that dirt , pieces of grass and fiber from Theismann 's sock were removed from the wound to decrease chances of infection and improve chances of fixing the bone properly in surgery . Theismann 's leg was encased in a pressure cast up to his knee , and he was placed on a stretcher . <p> As he was wheeled off the field , two of the people who helped push the stretcher , Tyer recalled , were fans who had come down from the stands , unchallenged by security . His departure from the stadium was accompanied by an ovation from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never forget as long as I live . . . . The big Longines clock at RFK Stadium was at 10:05 . Everything is so vivid in my mind . " <p> Carson remembers that , as Theismann was being taken off the field , " Joe being Joe said to all of us , ' Do n't worry guys . I 'll be back . ' I looked at him lying there and I said ' Joe , you 'll be back , but you wo n't be back tonight . ' At least he still had his sense of humor . " <p> Said Theismann , " Once they put me on that gurney , I think I said to backup quarterback Jay Schroeder , ' Go get ' em , kid . ' Then as they were wheeling me up behind the ambulance , I heard another roar . Art had just caught a long pass . Then we went to the hospital . When we pulled up there , as they were transferring me from the ambulance to a stretcher , they actually forgot to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I remember saying to the attendant , ' Hey , can you just grab the rest of me ? ' <p> " They started prepping me for surgery , but I wanted to see the rest of the game . So they brought in this little black and white TV with a coat hanger for an antenna . Late in the game , when the Giants missed an attempt on fourth down , I told the doctors , ' Okay , go do what you have to do . ' " <p> Back at RFK , Schroeder , who had played in only three games and thrown eight passes in his career , led the Redskins to a 23-21 victory , completing 13 of 21 passes for 221 yards and a touchdown . He went on to lead the team to five victories in the last six games and a 10-6 record that still was n't good enough to make the playoffs.At Arlington Hospital , Jackson began what he called a " meticulous surgery " on Theismann 's leg . " You started off with a gallon of saline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said . " The problem was that the membrane around the bone had been stripped away . It took awhile before we felt comfortable putting one bone against the other . Then you have to cast it so it does n't move . We put him in a long leg cast with a window so we could constantly clean the wound . " <p> Initially , Theismann did not doubt that he would play again . He had returned to the field only eight weeks after breaking his right leg in a Canadian Football League game in 1972 . <p> " I felt like it was just a broken leg , " he said . " That 's why I chose never to watch the footage of the play . There are two aspects to rehabilitation  --  the physical and the mental . I felt that if I never knew how bad the leg had been broken , the mental hurdle to the rehab would n't have been as big . I just felt why could n't I do it again ? " <p> This time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tibia had led to insufficient bone growth when his leg healed , leaving the right slightly shorter than the left . For an NFL quarterback , it was the end of the line  --  although Theismann admitted that took several years to sink in . <p> Theismann had other things on his mind as he recovered . He had gone through a messy and costly divorce only two years earlier . He was in a serious relationship with entertainer Kathy Lee Crosby , and had recentlypurchased a farm in Northern Virginia . Theismann was concerned about how he would continue to make the same kind of living without playing the game . He was in the first year of a four-year , $6 million contract . <p> When Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke signed him to the deal , he had handed him the business card of a Lloyd 's of London representative and insisted that Theismann take out an insurance policy that would at least pay off part of the contract if he was injured . He also told him not to deduct the cost of the premium on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not have to pay taxes on the settlement if the policy paid off . <p> " When it came time to cash in the insurance policy , we had doctors and attorneys out at the old Redskins Park , " Theismann said . " They wanted to see me work out to see if I could play again . I went out on the field to throw , and as I moved to my right , I was moving okay . When I tried to move to my left , I think I looked like Peg Leg Pete . The workout was supposed to last about 30 minutes . There were 15 people watching me when I started . When I turned my back at one point , I looked around and they were just about all gone . I said , ' Hey , wait , I 'm not done , ' and whoever was still out there said to me , ' Yes , you are . ' " <p> Lloyd 's paid about $1.5 million . Two years later , Theismann was still trying to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was interested in a 37-year-old quarterback coming off a badly broken leg . Even when Theismann launched his career as a football analyst at CBS , his initial contract with the network , and then two years later with ESPN , included clauses that he could get out of the deals if he signed a contract to play football . <p> That never happened . Instead , the injury redefined Theismann 's life . " I have friends who will say , ' Ah , he has n't changed that much , ' but I have . I really have , " he said . " I 've tried to understand the value of family and friendship . I had gotten so self-consumed trying to be Joe Theismann , the football star , instead of Joe Theismann , the person . I lost touch with what was important in life , and I certainly did n't pay the game itself the respect I should have . " <p> Theismann has remarried and remains a popular and highly compensated motivational speaker . This year , he was placed on the preliminary list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fame . Starting next season , he will be the analyst on " Monday Night Football " when ESPN takes over the broadcast from ABC , its parent company . <p> Theismann has stayed friendly with Taylor , who called him in the hospital the day after his initial surgery 20 years ago . When Theismann told Taylor he had broken both major bones in his right leg , Taylor wrote recently that he had joked , " That 's because I do n't do anything halfway . If I 'm gon na break them , I 'm gon na break them both . " <p> Taylor was unavailable for comment for this story . <p> " I once told him we were always going to be linked together because of that night , and he told me it had an impact on his life , too , " Theismann said . " He said it drove home the point to him that no matter how great you are , it can be over in a heartbeat , and you never know if tomorrow will be the last day you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CORRECTION : <p> A Nov. 18 Sports article about former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann misspelled the first name of entertainer Cathy Lee Crosby , Theismann 's ex-girlfriend.
