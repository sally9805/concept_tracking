Mistletoe and Mayhem Chapter One Christmas came a day early , but he was n't complaining . The timing could n't be better , as a matter of fact . Thanks to the latest terrorism orange alert , every cop and every fed in the county was ass-deep in work  --  car inspections at the border crossings , shoe checks at the airport , passenger list searches at the cruise ship terminal . While the authorities were busy counting bottles of tequila from Tijuana , sifting through the underwear of a grandpa en route to Grand Forks , or holding up one of the Princess Line from floating off toward Puerto Vallarta , he 'd be busy setting up his future . He had n't lived in San Diego long , but the situation he 'd inherited was perfect for a scheme  --  a dream , really  --  that had been brewing in his mind for years . Nothing was going to get in hisway . No one . Baring his teeth in a smile for his contact , Jaime , he hefted a battered backpack , testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " Jaime frowned . " It 's all there , yes ? " " Did n't I say so ? " He unzipped the nylon anyway , eyed the rubber-banded stacks of twenty dollar bills , and then let Jaime check them out too . The money looked grubby , but who the hell cared ? Clean or dirty , money procured whatever a man could want . He transferred his gaze to Jaime , noting the oily sheen of sweat on the man 's dark upper lip . His eyes narrowed . " You 'll do as we 've planned . " " S. Yes . " Jaime swiped at his mouth , and then reseated the ball cap covering his thick shock of hair . " As you said , seor . As we planned . " More beads of sweat popped , despite the pleasant midsixties temperature . With his gaze locked on Jaime 's , he shoved his hand beneath his wind jacket , his fingertips sliding over the Vuitton leather belt he 'd bought himself as an early Christmas present . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an accessory like that would only draw suspicion . Who would notice a belt ? True flashiness would have to wait a few years . His grip found the Beretta tucked in his waistband , and he pulled it out then tossed the handgun to Jaime . " Feliz Navidad . " " This has got to be worse than wrapping an in- flatable sex doll , " Stacy Banks muttered to herself , winding out another length of Christmas paper . Holding her bottom lip between her teeth , she folded , tucked , and taped . Then she took her veed scissors in hand to create a curly-ribbon confection in red and green . With a delicate touch , she placed it on top . Finally , inhaling a cautious breath , she spun toward the mirror to get a new perspective on the package . " Well , " she said to her reflection . " I suppose I look ... festive . " And not like a kindergarten teacher , which was much more to the point . Miss Banks of Room 2 at Lemoncrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corduroy pants perfect for the chasing , corralling , and educating of thirtyfour five-year-olds . Today 's get-up  --  a Betty-and- Wilma-like sarong of heavy-duty Christmas wrap complete with knee-length paper skirt pleated for ease of movement  --  was designed for interesting , enticing , and well ... enslaving just one thirtyfour- year-old man . Stacy plucked the cascade of ribbon out of her own blond curls and picked up a bobby pin to anchor it more securely . Ryan Beausoleil  --  transplanted from El Paso , Texas , to the condo above hers just a few months before  --  would n't know what hit him . He was toast . He was hers . If she found the guts to ask him to the party , that is . But a swift glance at the slip of paper lying on her kitchen table was all the **26;134;TOOLONG she needed . Formatted with a cutesy figure in one corner and the words your holiday elf beneath it , the paycheck showed a sizable number on the " Amount Of " line and her own name on the " Payable To " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribboning , and tagging . Extra money was good , and would be a pleasure to spend at the local mall . But it was the name scrawled on the signature line that was getting Stacy out of the house . Her younger sister 's name . Her younger , frecklefaced , former Barbie-stealing sister who had , six months before , come up with a business idea , a business plan , a business success . She 'd gone out on a limb . As had Stacy 's friend Delia , who 'd traveled to China two months ago and adopted a baby girl . As had Stacy 's yoga-class colleague , who 'd bought a five-hundred-dollar raffle ticket from the fire department in August and was now on a year-long cruise around the world . In those same months , Stacy had burped the baby , dutifully filled out lesson plans , worked as her sister 's temporary employee , and never missed a scheduled session at the local Yoga for You center . But she 'd never gone out on a limb . To the rustle of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny evening purse , leaving behind her day planner , her bulky wallet , and her cell phone . Anything else she needed would be at Your Holiday Elf 's endof- the-season party . Everything but her date . Stacy knew she 'd find him at the JMR Sport- fishing Landing on San Diego Bay . Even in the deepening twilight , the driving directions she 'd printed off the Internet were simple to follow and a parking space just as easy to find . The lot was nearly empty , but that did n't surprise her . Ryan had inherited a sportfishing boat from his uncle and he 'd told her that December was the offseason . He and the other boat operators who used this landing would n't have regular trips running again until spring . The place was n't entirely deserted , though . Just as she approached , a pair of men was coming through a locked gate leading to the docks . They held it open for her without question ...               @ @ @ @ @ @
