Into the Storm By Suzanne Brockmann Random House Suzanne Brockmann Chapter One Two Months Later San Diego , California Friday , December 2 , 2005 Lindsey Fontaine knocked on her boss 's door . It was ajar , so she pushed it open , peeking in . " You wanted to see me , sir , " she started , but then realized there was someone in a Navy uniform sitting across from his desk . " Oh , I 'm sorry . " " No , come on in , Linds . " Her boss , Tom Paoletti , waved her into the room . " You 've met Mark Jenkins , have n't you ? " " Not officially , " Lindsey told him . She 'd seen Jenkins earlier this morning . Hanging out at the new receptionist 's desk . Reading rank was n't one of her strengths , but Tom was a former Navy SEAL . His company , Troubleshooters Incorporated , did a great deal of business with the government , including the military . Which meant lots of uniforms walked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really taking them this fresh out of diapers these days ?  - -  pushing himself to his feet while favoring his left side was a petty officer , first class . And oh , yes , he was definitely first-class -- in more ways than one . Extra cute , with muscles . But wait . His rank meant he 'd been in the Navy for a number of years , because petty officers started at third class and worked their way up to first . And that meant he could n't be as young as he looked . Shame on her for makingassumptions . She should 've known better -- as someone who still got carded . At the movies . When she went to see an R-rated film . Lindsey knew firsthand what a pain in the butt it was to look far younger than her years . " Nice to meet you , Lindsey , " Jenkins said as he shook her hand . Good grip . Solid eye contact . Pretty , pretty hazel eyes . Great smile . Cute freckles . And not too tall , either . She liked him already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tracy Shapiro , Troubleshooters Incorporated 's remarkably inept new receptionist . Of course , most men seemed to turn into idiots around women who looked like Tracy , the brainless hairdo . Not that Lindsey had exchanged more than a casual greeting with Tracy , who 'd started working there just a few days ago . But there was no doubt about it , Tracy had set Lindsey 's Brainless Hair-Do-o-meter clacking right away . It might 've had something to do with Tracy bumming five bucks for lunch off of Alyssa -- after flat-out flirting with Alyssa 's husband , Sam . But okay , to be fair , it was n't the flirting-with-Sam part that was a problem . Alyssa had to be good and used to that . The Real Hair-Do Action came from Tracy lamenting her lack of money for lunch , accepting a fiver from Alyssa with only the vaguest of promises to pay it back , and then , without taking a breath , launching into an explanation of how she 'd seen the shoes she was wearing on sale , and she just had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten them for only three hundred dollars ? When Lindsey came to work , she wore sneakers or clunky-heeled boots , bought on sale for $29.95 , so . . . No . She could not believe that any pair of shoes , even those made by mermaids off the coast of Sicily , could be worth three hundred dollars . " Jenk found Tracy for us , " Tom Paoletti told Lindsey now . " They were friends back in high school . " " Ah , " she said . They were friends back in high school was guy code for Jenk had always wanted to jump her bones . Apparently , he had n't given up trying . He no doubt thought helping her get a job might work . " That explains it . " Oops , she probably should n't have said that aloud . " I mean , I 'm sure she 's just feeling her way , first days and all , " Lindsey added , putting on what she hoped would be perceived as an optimistic expression . " I mean , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kind of scary . Kind of overwhelming . . . " " Absolutely , " Jenk said , flashing her a grateful smile . And first days of work had to be doubly hard for Tracy , who 'd apparently been intercepted midway through her quest to see the Wizard and finally get a brain . Cleverly , Lindsey did n't say that aloud . " Have a seat , " Tom ordered in that easygoing way he had of making a demand sound like an invitation . She sat . Jenkins sat , too . Tom Paoletti was the best boss Lindsey had ever had . Not only was he good-looking in that **25;772;TOOLONG , bald-men-can-be-sexy way , but he was also smart and unbelievably kind . Maybe too kind . Lindsey made a mental note to offer to volunteer to fire Tracy for him . After the past few years she 'd had , firing someone would be a cakewalk . She would n't even blink . She 'd mention that to Tom later , when Mark Jenkins was n't around . " We 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with SEAL Team Sixteen , " Tom told her now . " Jenk is going to be liaison as we work out the logistics . " " Really . " Lindsey looked at the SEAL . " How . . . " Convenient , she was about to say , since his being liaison would give him even more access to Tracy . Except , Tracy was not a multi-tasker , and his distracting presence would be far less convenient for everyone else in the office . She , for one , was extremely tired of answering the phones because Tracy had managed to screw up the voice mail system again . " Interesting , " she said instead , because they were both waiting for her to finish her sentence . Day-am , the freckles across Jenk 's nose were positively adorable , especially when he frowned . Combined with those hazel eyes , rimmed by thick , dark lashes . . . He was beyond cute , but it was probably in a way that he himself hated . Baby-faced cute . His mouth tightened slightly , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm twenty-eight years old . " " Oh , " she said . " No , I wasn't --  " " You were wondering , " Jenk said . " I could see that you were wondering , so . . . Now you know . I 'm old enough to vote . " " Actually , I was n't wondering . " Lindsey glanced at Tom , who smiled , apparently in no hurry to talk about that training op . Red Cell . That was going to be some kind of fun . " I mean , I was earlier , but then I did the math , figuring that you probably went to college and then . . . I had you at more like thirty , if you want to know the truth . " She 'd surprised him . " You really thought . . . ? " She shrugged . " Hey . Without makeup , I look about twelve . " He looked at her -- really looked . " Being flat-chested helps with the illusion , " she said . " I 'm five feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every eighth . I 'm also the same age as my bra size -- 30A . The A is for my four-oh average at UCLA , which I attended before my seven years with the LAPD . " She smiled at him . " I 'm one of Tom 's best bodyguards , by the way . I specialize in the protection of people who might not want their friends , business associates , and/or enemies to know they 're being protected . Because I could tell that you were wondering . " She 'd stunned him , so she turned to Tom who was now flat-out grinning . " Red Cell , huh ? So you called me in here , boss , because you want me to play the part of Dr. Evil , the terrorist mastermind , right ? " Lindsey liked Tom for a lot of reasons , but particularly because she made him laugh . Some people did n't get her sense of humor , although Cutie-pie Jenkins seemed to be on the same page after he 'd shaken off his shock . " Sorry , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " It was a direct request from Admiral Tucker . " Ah . " Which makes me . . . " She let her voice trail off . " Mini Me ? " Tom laughed again . " Tempting , but no . Not quite . " Uh-oh . " Please do n't say that I'm --  " He spoke in unison with her . " The hostage . " Lindsey stared at him . " Someone 's got to be the hostage , " Tom pointed out , undaunted by her scathing disbelief . " Yeah , but come on . How realistic is it for the hostage to weigh only ninety-two pounds ? " She leaned forward to argue . " Do n't you want to give the SEALs a challenge ? " Lindsey turned to Jenk . " Tell him you want a challenge . Tell him you want , I do n't know , Sam Starrett to play the hostage . What is he ? Six and a half feet tall ? Two ten ? Now if only he had a heart condition , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it 's going to be you , " Tom told her . She knew when to stop pushing , so instead she sighed heavily . " All right . " " We 'll talk more later , " Tom said , four little words made even more intriguing by the gleam in his eyes . Was it possible she was going to be more than the hostage ? Suddenly this was back to maybe being fun . Maybe . " I just wanted you to meet Jenk , " Tom continued . " If he needs help with the scheduling -- or really anything , " he added addressing Jenkins directly , " he 's going to come to you , Linds . " Oh , good . She was going to get to be the secretary , as well as the hostage , helping out with scheduling . Whoo-freakin ' - hoo . She would have complained that she never saw Tom assigning Sam Starrett to help out with the scheduling -- except for the fact that Sam was bitching about Tom giving him a similar task just last week . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two teams meet , sometime in the next week , " Jenk suggested . " Maybe over at the Ladybug Lounge ? " " Really ? " Lindsey was skeptical . " That does n't seem very realistic . Meeting in advance , at a bar ? " Hello , Osama , can the boys in your San Diego sleeper cell make it to a party on Tuesday night ? " This is a silver bullet assignment , " Jenk informed her , then translated . " Just short of R &R.; Or it was supposed to be . Before Admiral Tucker got it into his head that it would be a kick to pit Tommy here against the new CO of Team Sixteen . " Yikes . Lindsey looked at her boss . " Your old team versus your new ? " she asked . " That 's got ta suck . For your old team . " She turned back to Jenk . " We are so going to kick your butts . " " Yeah , I do n't think so . We 're SEALs . And -- no offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The poor guy , " Lindsey said . " Because , like , is n't Team Sixteen still referred to as ' Tom 's Team ' ? I mean , that 's got ta sting . Koehl 's been there , what ? At least a year already . That must be frustrating . And now if he loses -- when he loses --  " Tom interrupted . " Training ops are not about winning and losing . They 're about learning . About improving . " Lindsey looked at Jenk , who was looking back at Lindsey with an expression equally disbelieving . Not about winning ? Who did Tom think he was kidding ? " And yes , " Tom continued . " This was supposed to be fun . So let 's see if we ca n't find the time for that social event . Do n't forget to invite Lew Koehl . Let 's try to downplay the winning and losing thing . Starting right here and now . " Lindsey looked over at Jenk again . " I 'm down with learning , " she said , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planted in that chair , making a tiny kicking motion with her foot . " Totally into improving , " he agreed , shooting her back a discreet L for loser , shaped with his thumb and forefinger , out of Tom 's line of sight . Lindsey could n't help it . She laughed , covering it quickly with a cough . Tom , of course , was n't fooled . He rubbed his forehead . " I 'm serious , people . This is going to be . . . at best , difficult . Both for Commander Koehl and for me . I want you working together . Let 's turn this into a win for everyone . " He smiled tightly . " Except maybe Admiral Tucker . " " We should look at a calendar , " Jenk told Lindsey . " And exchange cell phone numbers . " Those words coming from those lips should have made her heart beat harder . Mark Jenkins wanted her phone number . He was cute and funny and smart -- and tremendously flawed . He had , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindsey 's number was purely work-related . No doubt about it , he was Lindsey 's type . Perfectly , cleanly out of reach , unless , of course he got a little drunk and ended up going home with Lindsey as his solid second choice . Oh , yeah , if she played her cards right , she could get totally skewered by this one . Although it had been quite some time since she 'd been skewered -- or preskewered , which was far more enjoyable . Still , a little distance would probably be prudent . " Would n't Tracy be a better person to assist Jenkins with this ? " she suggested , even as she took one of the Troubleshooters Incorporated business cards off of the little holder on Tom 's desk . She wrote her number on the back . " I mean , I 'm happy to do it , of course . I was just thinking , since they 're , you know , old friends "  - -  wink , wink --  " Jenk might appreciate spending time with her . " Jenkins liked that idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , still rummaging for one of his own . Yeah , she had been right about him favoring one side . He definitely did n't have full range of motion in his left arm . Her own shoulder -- her right one -- twinged in sympathy . If she had n't just decided to keep her distance , she could 've given him some rehab and recovery tips . Tom , meanwhile , was n't as thrilled as Jenk was about her Tracy idea .
