<p> A year ago this Wednesday , Bill Gates sent a memo to Microsoft 's 50,000 employees identifying " Trustworthy Computing " as the company 's highest priority . <p> As he uses the term , " trustworthiness " encompasses many things , from eliminating system crashes to ensuring that users are always in control of their personal information . But the heart of it is security  --  protecting PCs from unauthorized intruders and from viruses , worms and other species of malicious code . <p> After spending much of the past week talking to experts ( for a news analysis that appeared in Sunday 's Chronicle ) about what has and has n't changed in Redmond , Wash. , since that famous missive , I have a suggestion for Mr. Gates . Put Longhorn , a major overhaul of Windows that 's already at least two years away from release , on hold for a few months and assign the developers involved to a crash program designed to make it easier for users to discover vulnerabilities in their systems and get the appropriate fixes installed without hassle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already add an automatic update option to Windows XP and Windows 2000 . That may be a welcome solution for some people , but Microsoft should also provide good tools for those of us who do n't trust any company to install code on our PCs without our approval . <p> ( Bruce Schneier , a renowned cryptographer and chief technical officer of Counterpane Internet Systems , a network-monitoring service for corporate customers , reinforced my suspicion of the automatic update mechanism last week . For a malicious coder , he told me , " that 's just another channel for attack . It 's bound to be co-opted sooner or later . " ) <p> And if Microsoft is really serious about stopping malicious code attacks , it should also do something to solve the problem for the 160 million users it estimates still use Windows 98 and NT  --  no matter how much both businessmen and engineers hate to invest resources in products from which they can never make money . <p> Shifting resources in the way I propose would undoubtedly delay the security nirvana Longhorn is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , much of Microsoft 's top talent reportedly works on Longhorn . And if they did their job well , and Microsoft fired up its mighty marketing and distribution machinery to get the fruits of its labor into users ' hands , it would go a long way toward making computing more secure in the here and now . <p> Two things got me thinking along these lines . One was reading an analysis by Symantec of " Top Five Worldwide Internet Security Threats in 2002 . " The other was a vain and frustrating effort to get the software on my own work PC up to date . <p> The Symantec paper lists the security threats most commonly reported to the company 's security response center last year . Number one on the list was the H variant of the Klez worm , which was reported 297,196 times  --  more than twice the total recorded by Hybris when it topped the list in 2001 . Next on the 2002 list were four other worms : Bugbear , the E variant of Klez , Hybris and Magistr . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rapidly moving mass-mailer worms , " meaning that they spread by e-mail ( in some cases among other mechanisms ) . <p> What I found particularly interesting is that Microsoft has long provided security patches that would stop these critters in their tracks . In fact , they 're mostly stopped by the Outlook E-mail Security Update , a patch Microsoft released 2 1/2 years ago , well before any of these worms was first discovered . <p> In other words , Klez and the rest would never have become the plagues they are if Microsoft 's patches were widely installed . <p> ANALYZE THAT : All this got me thinking about my own machine at work , which currently runs Windows 2000 Professional , and I realized I had no idea what if any security patches it had installed . Although I 'd never heard of any Microsoft software for answering that question  --  and certainly none of the countless Microsoft product managers and flacks who contact me regularly to tout the company 's latest products had ever mentioned anything about such a utility  --  I headed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lo and behold , I discovered a program that seemed to be exactly what I was looking for , called the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer ( **59;8550;TOOLONG ) . Using it , however , was like a bad joke about Microsoft software . In the first place , it reported that it could n't do its security update scan and several other tests because it " could not access the security update XML file , " whatever that may be . <p> For the tests it manages to run , the results it reported were largely incomprehensible to me , and mind you , I can handle a lot more geek-speak than most people . When I clicked the " How to correct this " link the program conveniently places under each problem it reports , things went from bad to worse . <p> For example , I got a big red X on the grounds that " Computer is running with RestrictAnonymous = o . " The " How to correct this " page explained " To restrict anonymous connections from accessing this system information , change the RestrictAnonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Configuration Manager snap-in ( setting is defined in the Local Policies portion of the default security templates ) , or through a registry editor . " <p> Microsoft  --  in its own self-interest as well as its customers '  --  ought to develop a simple , reliable utility that could scan any Windows system and report what gaps it finds in plain English . It should offer to plug any or all of the vulnerabilities it finds automatically , or tell users where they can find further information and patches if they want to control the process themselves . And it should explain all this intelligibly , with links to the technical details for those who want them . <p> UPDATE HELL : After giving up on the Baseline Analyzer , I decided I should at least install the Outlook E-mail Security Update , the one that stops e-mail worms . The Chronicle 's systems group , using software from Symantec , seems to do a very good job of protecting us from catching or spreading these problems , so I was n't really worried . But on the theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should install it anyway . <p> In fact , I had installed it once before , back in 2000 , when I wrote about it in this column . But last fall , when I tried to install one of Microsoft 's " critical updates " for Internet Explorer , it told me that I could n't do so until I first updated my operating system , then NT 4.0 , with Service Pack 6 . <p> Being a good corporate citizen  --  and generally cautious when it comes to hardware I depend on  --  I called our systems people to ask whether it was OK to apply SP-6 . No problem , they assured me  --  it 's been around for years , and we 've never had any problems with it . So I downloaded and installed . <p> That was the end of my hard drive . The SP-6 installation seemed to go uneventfully , but when my machine rebooted , I got a message saying that it could n't find the NT kernel . When I called systems to describe the problem , they told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me I had a snowball 's chance in hell of fixing the problem . I spent hours trying anyway , but finally concluded they were right and let them reformat my drive . <p> That episode cost me not only time and aggravation , but also several weeks ' worth of mail archived on my machine but not backed up . And when I got my system up and running again  --  this time with Windows 2000  --  I forgot about reinstalling the security patch on my new copy of Outlook 2000 . <p> So last week , when I remembered about it , I headed to the Microsoft site and tried to download the patch . Unfortunately , it required Outlook 2000 SR-1A , and I had only SR-1 . After a little research , I discovered installing something called the Office 2000/Windows 2000 Registry Repair Utility would get me from SR-1 to SR-1A , so I downloaded and successfully installed that . <p> At that point I was able to start the Outlook update , but it quickly informed me that my copy of Office was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office 2000 SR-1 Update  --  even though not only Outlook , but also the other Office components I checked said they were SR-1 . <p> So I downloaded the first part of the Office , which then told me I needed another part , the " Core Update , " that would take 159 minutes to download . Fortunately , it was lying  --  the download took only a few minutes . <p> But when I ran that update , it told me it could n't proceed until I inserted my Office 2000 Professional CD . Because my copy is covered by The Chronicle 's site license , I do n't have a copy of that CD , and I was n't about to bother systems about it . <p> That was the end of the line for me  --  I 'd already wasted more time than any rational person would on this project , and it had gotten me precisely nowhere . <p> I reported my war stories to Scott Charney , the former cybercrime prosecutor who for the last year has had the job of chief security strategist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in what he called " security usability . " <p> That 's putting it mildly .
