Even on the newly hipped-up , post-Louis Rukeyser PBS , " reality series " means something different . Instead of thongs , you get bonnets . But the six-part Frontier House ( check local listings ) , which sends three real-life families to lead the hardscrabble life of 1880s Montana pioneers , is not unlike Survivor . On both , the players slaughter pigs  --  and come close to slaughtering one another as well . <P> Frontier 's families spend more than five months farming , cooking , tending livestock and felling trees  --  an especially hard life for the Xbox-deprived kids . But the real drama is psychological . Competitive Tennesseans Karen and Mark Glenn squabble with each other and with the Clunes  --  well-off , whiny Californians who sneak in food and gear , rationalizing that pioneers would have cheated to survive if they could have . ( The Brookses , a young interracial couple , are neighborly and mellow , and thus get relatively little screen time . ) The couples clash over purity of lifestyle , rules and personalities , all within a context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food co-op ever . <P> The show offers some factoids about prairie life ( makeup was considered immoral ) , but it 's truly about 21st century society . The women adjust to an un-p.c. life of cooking and cleaning for their newly Marlboro-ized men . " The whole place is like a man 's playground , " one woman says . And a surprisingly moving epilogue follows the families ' re-entry into mall-and-microwave life . Their conclusion  --  that we 're alienated from our work and nature  --  is trite but hard earned . Does that mean they end up swearing off fast food and video games ? Dream on , Pilgrim .  --  By James Poniewozik
