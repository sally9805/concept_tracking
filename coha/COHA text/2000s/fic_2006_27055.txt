Wintersmith By Terry Pratchett HarperTeen Terry Pratchett The Big Snow When the storm came , it hit the hills like a hammer . No sky should hold as much snow as this , and because no sky could , the snow fell , fell in a wall of white . There was a small hill of snow where there had been , a few hours ago , a little cluster of thorn trees on an ancient mound . This time last year there had been a few early primroses ; now there was just snow . Part of the snow moved . A piece about the size of an apple rose up , with smoke pouring out around it . A hand no larger than a rabbit 's paw waved the smoke away . A very small but very angry blue face , with the lump of snow still balanced on top of it , looked out at the sudden white wilderness . " Ach , crivens ! " it grumbled . " Will ye no ' look at this ? ' T is the work o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tak ' ' no ' fra ' an answer ! " Other lumps of snow were pushed up . More heads peered out . " Oh waily , waily , waily ! " said one of them . " He 's found the big wee hag again ! " The first head turned toward this head , and said , " Daft Wullie ? " " Yes , Rob ? " " Did I no ' tell ye to lay off that waily business ? " " Aye , Rob , ye did that , " said the head addressed as Daft Wullie . " So why did ye just do it ? " " Sorry , Rob . It kinda bursted out . " " It 's so dispiritin ' . " " Sorry , Rob . Rob Anybodysighed . " But I fear ye 're right , Wullie . He 's come for the big wee hag , right enough . Who 's watchin ' over her doon at the farm ? " " Wee Dangerous Spike , Rob . " Rob looked up at clouds so full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and sighed again . " It 's time fra ' the Hero . " He ducked out of sight , the plug of snow dropping neatly back into place , and slid down into the heart of the Feegle mound . It was quite big inside . A human could just about stand up in the middle , but would then bend double with coughing because the middle was where there was a hole to let smoke out . All around the inner wall were tiers of galleries , and every one of them was packed with Feegles . Usually the place was awash with noise , but now it was frighteningly quiet . Rob Anybody walked across the floor to the fire , where his wife , Jeannie , was waiting . She stood straight and proud , like a kelda should , but close up it seemed to him that she had been crying . He put his arm around her . " All right , ye probably ken what 's happenin ' , " he told the blue-and-red audience looking down on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found the big wee hag-noo then , settle doon ! " He waited until the shouting and sword rattling had died down , then went on : " We canna fight the Wintersmith for her ! That 's her road ! We canna walk it for her ! But the hag o ' hags has set us on another path ! It 's a dark one , and dangerous ! " A cheer went up . Feegles liked the idea of this , at least . " Right ! " said Rob , satisfied . " Ah 'm awa ' tae fetch the Hero ! " There was a lot of laughter at this , and Big Yan , the tallest of the Feegles , shouted , " It 's tae soon . We 've only had time tae gie him a couple o ' heroing lessons ! He 's still nae more than a big streak o ' nothin ' ! " " He 'll be a Hero for the big wee hag and that 's an end o ' it , " said Rob sharply . " Noo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ye ! Tae the chalk pit ! Dig me a path tae the Underworld ! " It had to be the Wintersmith , Tiffany Aching told herself , standing in front of her father in the freezing farmhouse . She could feel it out there . This was n't normal weather even for midwinter , and this was springtime . It was a challenge . Or perhaps it was just a game . It was hard to tell , with the Wintersmith . Only it ca n't be a game because the lambs are dying . I 'm only just thirteen , and my father , and a lot of other people older than me , want me to do something . And I ca n't . The Wintersmith has found me again . He is here now , and I 'm too weak . It would be easier if they were bullying me , but no , they 're begging . My father 's face is gray with worry and he 's begging . My father is begging me . Oh no , he 's taking his hat off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! They think magic comes free when I snap my fingers . But if I ca n't do this for them , now , what good am I ? I ca n't let them see I 'm afraid . Witches are n't allowed to be afraid . And this is my fault . I : I started all this . I must finish it . Mr. Aching cleared his throat . " ... And , er , if you could ... er , magic it away , uh , or something ? For us ... ? " Everything in the room was gray , because the light from the windows was coming through snow . No one had wasted time digging the horrible stuff away from the houses . Every person who could hold a shovel was needed elsewhere , and still there were not enough of them . As it was , most people had been up all night , walking the flocks of yearlings , trying to keep the new lambs safe ... in the dark , in the snow .... Her snow . It was a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " she said . " I 'll see what I can do . " " Good girl , " said her father , grinning with relief . No , not a good girl , thought Tiffany . I brought this on us . " You 'll have to make a big fire , up by the sheds , " she said aloud . " I mean a big fire , do you understand ? Make it out of anything that will burn ...
