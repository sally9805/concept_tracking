When it comes to helping clean up soils contaminated with heavy and toxic metals , nature has ARS plant physiologist Leon V. Kochian to thank . <p> During 13 years of research at the U.S. Plant , Soil , and Nutrition Laboratory at Ithaca , New York , Kochian has become an authority on mechanisms used by certain plants to take up essential mineral nutrients and toxic heavy metals from soils . He has also characterized strategies some plants use to tolerate toxic soil environments . <p> Kochian is an international expert on plant responses to environmental stress , plant mineral nutrition , and use of plants to clean up or remediate soils contaminated with heavy metals and radioisotopes . <p> Besides providing important new information on how to use plants in this practical way , Kochian 's research may also shed light on an important nutritional concern : how to prevent toxic metals from entering the food chain . <p> " One of the primary ways toxic heavy metals , such as cadmium , get in food is through plant uptake  --  the metal is taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> " Contaminated soils and waters pose major environmental , agricultural , and human health problems worldwide , " says Kochian . " These problems may be partially solved by an emerging new technology  --  phytoremediation . " " Green " Technology : Simple Concept and Cost-Effective <p> Phytoremediation is the use of green plants to remove pollutants from the environment or render them harmless . <p> " Current engineering-based technologies used to clean up soils  --  like the removal of contaminated topsoil for storage in landfills  --  are very costly , " Kochian says , " and dramatically disturb the landscape . " <p> Kochian 's cost-effective " green " technology uses plants to " vacuum " heavy metals from the soil through their roots . He says , " Certain plant species  --  known as metal hyperaccumulators  --  have the ability to extract elements from the soil and concentrate them in the easily harvested plant stems , shoots , and leaves . These plant tissues can be collected , reduced in volume , and stored for later use . " <p> While acting as vacuum cleaners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive high levels of heavy metals in soils  --  like zinc , cadmium , and nickel . <p> " Phytoremediation has been hampered historically by our inadequate understanding of transport and tolerance mechanisms , " says Kochian . To address this deficit , Kochian  --  working with ARS research associate Deborah L. Lethman , Cornell University postdoctoral associates Mitch Lasat and Paul B. Larsen , and graduate students Nicole S. Pence and Stephen D. Ebbs  --  has been studying a unique and promising metal hyperaccumulator . The plant is Thlaspi caerulescens , commonly known as alpine pennycress . <p> " Thlaspi is a small , weedy member of the broccoli and cabbage family , " Kochian says . " It thrives on soils having high levels of zinc and cadmium . " <p> His lab has been trying to discover the underlying mechanism that enables T. caerulescens to accumulate excessive amounts of heavy metals . How Plants Clean Up <p> " Hyperaccumulators like Thlaspi are a marvelous model system for elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of  --  and ultimately the genes that control  --  metal hyperaccumulation , " says Kochian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken up from the soil by roots and deposited at other locations within the plant . <p> " There are a number of sites in the plant that could be controlled by different genes contributing to the hyperaccumulation trait , " says Kochian . " These genes govern processes that can increase the solubility of metals in the soil surrounding the roots as well as the transport proteins that move metals into root cells . From there , the metals enter the plant 's vascular system for further transport to other parts of the plant and are ultimately deposited in leaf cells . " <p> Kochian 's team has gained insights into how , at the molecular level , Thlaspi accumulates these metals in its shoots at astoundingly high levels . " A typical plant may accumulate about 100 parts per million ( ppm ) zinc and 1 ppm cadmium . Thlaspi can accumulate up to 30,000 ppm zinc and 1,500 ppm cadmium in its shoots , while exhibiting few or no toxicity symptoms , " he says . " A normal plant can be poisoned with as little as 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its shoots . " <p> The research also suggests an approach for economically recovering these metals . " Zinc and cadmium are metals that can be removed from contaminated soil by harvesting the plant 's shoots and extracting the metals from them , " he says . <p> After investigating the molecular physiology of zinc hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi , Kochian 's group found that several key sites for zinc transport were greatly stimulated in this plant . To get at the mechanism underlying the stimulation , they cloned a zinc transport gene  --  one of the first such accomplishments achieved with any plant . This breakthrough enabled the researchers to discover that zinc transport is regulated differently in normal and hyperaccumulator plants . <p> " In normal plants , the activity of zinc transporter genes is regulated by the zinc levels in the plant , " he says . " In Thlaspi , however , these genes are maximally active at all times  --  independent of plant zinc levels  --  until you raise the tissue zinc levels to very high concentrations . This results in very high rates of zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves . " It Even Works With Uranium <p> For soil contaminated with uranium , Kochian found that adding the organic acid citrate to soils greatly increases both the solubility of uranium and its bioavailability for plant uptake and translocation . Citrate does this by binding to insoluble uranium in the soil . <p> " With the citrate treatment , shoots of test plants increased their uranium concentration to over 2,000 ppm  --  100 times higher than the control plants , " he says . This demonstrates the possibility of using citrate  --  an inexpensive soil amendment  --  to help plants reduce uranium contamination . <p> Recently , Kochian , with colleagues Lasat and Ebbs , identified specific agronomic practices and plant species to remediate soils contaminated with radioactive cesium or cesium-137 . <p> " Although the cause of cesium-137 contamination  --  aboveground nuclear testing  --  has been reduced , large land areas are still polluted with radiocesium , " Kochian says . " Cesium is a long-lived radioisotope with a half-life of 32.2 years . It contaminates soils at several U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) sites in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soils is very high  --  over $300 billion . " <p> Phytoremediation is an attractive alternative to current cleanup methods that are energy intensive and very expensive . <p> In initial lab and greenhouse studies , Kochian 's team showed that the primary limitation to removing cesium from soils with plants was its bioavailability . The form of the element made it unavailable to the plants for uptake . <p> In a series of soil extraction studies , Kochian 's team found the ammonium ion was most effective in dissolving cesium-137 in soils . This treatment increased the availability of cesium-137 for root uptake and significantly stimulated radioactive cesium accumulation in plant shoots . <p> Later , Kochian did field studies with six different plant species in collaboration with Mark Fuhrmann , a DOE scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , New York . They found significant variation in the effectiveness of plant species for cleaning up contaminated sites . <p> " One species , a pigweed called Amaranthus retroflexus , was up to 40 times more effective than others tested in removing radiocesium from soil . We were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 3-month growing season , " says Kochian . " With two or three yearly crops , the plant could clean up the contaminated site in less than 15 years . " <p> As a result of Kochian 's findings , DOE is performing pilot studies at Brookhaven using this technology . Aluminum Hurts Crops Worldwide <p> Kochian 's lab is also working on finding ways to grow crops on marginal lands such as acid soils , where toxic levels of aluminum limit crop production . Aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth 's crust ; it is a major component of clays in soil . <p> At neutral or alkaline pH values , aluminum is not a problem for plants . However , in acid soils a form of aluminum  --  Al +3  --  is solubilized into a soil solution that is quite toxic to plant roots . For years , scientists have been baffled by the causes of aluminum toxicity in plants . <p> " Aluminum toxicity limits crop production on acid soils , which cover well over half of the world 's 8 billion acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , " Kochian says . " When soils become acid , the toxic aluminum damages plant root systems , which greatly reduces yields . " <p> Kochian 's research in collaboration with ARS plant molecular biologist David F. Garvin uses an interdisciplinary approach integrating molecular , genetic , and physiological research to provide insights into how particular genetic types of some plant species  --  including wheat , corn , and sorghum  --  can tolerate high levels of the metal in acid soils . <p> " We found that the root tip is the key site of injury , leading to inhibited root growth , a stunted root system , and reduced yields or crop failures from decreased uptake of water and nutrients , " Kochian says . <p> " Aluminum triggers the release of protective organic acids , specifically from the root tip into adjacent soil . When released , these acids form a complex with the toxic aluminum , preventing the metal 's entry into the root . Wheat and corn tolerate aluminum by excluding the metal from the root tip , " Kochian says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism in collaboration with plant molecular biologist Steve H. Howell of Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell , using thale cress , Arabidopsis thaliana , a diminutive , weedy member of the mustard family . <p> He and colleagues have successfully identified Arabidopsis mutants that are aluminum tolerant . Kochian is studying differences between these mutants and a wild type of Arabidopsis to identify the molecular basis of tolerance . <p> The ultimate goal of this research is to isolate the genes conferring aluminum tolerance . It should then be possible to improve the tolerance of relatively aluminum-sensitive crop species , such as barley , or to further enhance the tolerance of existing aluminum-tolerant germplasm . <p> " One of the major goals for agricultural scientists for the immediate future is to increase food production to keep up with an ever-growing world population , " Kochian says . " As much of the world 's best agricultural land is already under cultivation or is being lost to industrialization , there is increasing pressure for farmers to cultivate marginal lands such as the huge expanses of acid soils that are not currently used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at producing crop genotypes that tolerate the suboptimal conditions of these marginal lands is one way global food production can be increased significantly . Being able to produce a wider range of crop species with increased aluminum tolerance will make a major contribution to these efforts to cultivate marginal , stressed soil environments . " <p> Besides helping farmers who grow crops on acid soils , Kochian 's phytoremediation research findings are used by other scientists in government and academia and by environmental consultants , government , and industry groups complying with cleanup of contaminated sites . <p> For his landmark phytoremediation research , Kochian has received two awards : in 1999 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary 's Honor Award for Environmental Protection and an award as ARS 1999 Outstanding Senior Scientist of the Year . Today 's " Phyto-miners " Rush to the Cry of " There 's Metals in Them Thar Plants ! " <p> Gold rush miners might have been better off using plants to find gold rather than panning streams for the precious metal . <p> Early prospectors in Europe used certain weeds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These weeds are the only plants that can thrive on soils with a high content of heavy metals . One such plant is alpine pennycress , Thlaspi caerulescens , a wild perennial herb found on zinc- and nickel-rich soils in many countries . This plant occurs in alpine areas of Central Europe as well as in our Rocky Mountains . Most varieties grow only 8 to 12 inches high and have small , white flowers . <p> In 1998 , ARS agronomist Rufus L. Chaney and colleagues in ARS , at the University of Maryland , and in England patented a method to use such plants to " phyto-mine " nickel , cobalt , and other metals . <p> Chaney says biomining is the use of plants to mine valuable heavy-metal minerals from contaminated or mineralized soils , as opposed to decontaminating soils . <p> " The crops would be grown as hay . The plants would be cut and baled after they 'd taken in enough minerals , " Chaney says . " Then they 'd be burned and the ash sold as ore . Ashes of alpine pennycress grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent zinc  --  which is as high as high-grade ore . Electricity generated by the burning could partially offset biomining costs . " <p> USDA has signed a cooperative research and development agreement with Viridian Environmental , a technology company based in Houston , Texas . The CRADA involves Scott Angle at the University of Maryland ; Alan J.M. Baker at the University of Sheffield , United Kingdom ; plant breeder Yin-Ming Li with Viridian ; and a cooperator at Oregon State University . Viridian is funding the CRADA 's phyto-mining research and development to the tune of $1 million over 5 years . <p> Chaney says that to make phyto-mining as well as phytoremediation worthwhile requires , at a minimum , a plant with very high annual intake of minerals , such as the **25;2789;TOOLONG pennycress variety for which they have filed a patent application . <p> " Better still , the traits of plants like pennycress could be incorporated into a high-yielding commercial crop like canola grown for hay , " Chaney says . <p> His idea of the best hyperaccumulators ? " They 'd have all the characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high yielding , fast growing , easy to harvest , and deep rooted . And they should hold onto their mineral-rich leaves so they can be harvested along with the plant stems . "  --  By Don Comis , ARS . <p> <p> Rufus L.
