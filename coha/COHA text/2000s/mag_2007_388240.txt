Sidebar Braising basics " But my stews always turn out bland , " a friend lamented when I suggested she make Provenal beef stew for her next dinner party . When I think of stews and chilis , hearty and satisfying are what come to mind , so I was determined to solve her problem . The first question I had for her : What kind of pot are you using ? Its important to use something heavy in order to get concentrated flavor . Both Le Creuset and Staub make enamel-coated cast-iron Dutch ovens with tight-fitting lids that are ideal for braising , but any cast-iron or cast-aluminum pot will do . What about browning ? You need to pat the meat dry , then cook it in batches to sear and caramelize it for rich flavor . Use tongs to remove meat from the pan so you do n't pierce it and lose the juices . Stovetop or oven ? I love slow oven braising . It cooks more evenly with virtually no maintenance . Any stovetop stew can be made in the oven at 325F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Clementines Sweet , aromatic , and typically seedless , clementines are the perfect citrus for snacking .
