<p> Rachel Caesar , the first American-born in her family of immigrants from Trinidad , served in the National Guard and Army Reserve for 14 years . Today , three years after returning from a tour of duty in Afghanistan , she 's out of an apartment , out of work , and , on some days , ready to " run away and hide . " <p> Ms. Caesar still suffers from sleepless nights , jumpiness , and vivid flashbacks of weapon fire and land mine victims . In 2005 , her doctors diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) ; soon after , she had to quit her customer service job of eight years . <p> After she fell behind in rent , she and her landlord agreed it was time for her to go . " I 'm not sure how long I can stay here , " she says , of her mother 's house in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston , where she and her two sons have been living for the past two months . " I would go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kids through that . " <p> Like many women who return from war , Caesar - who calls herself " on the verge of homelessness " - is struggling to adjust to civilian life , make ends meet , and find a permanent home . <p> An estimated 8,000 female veterans are homeless in the US - the most in the nation 's history and a number that is expected to increase as more women return from the war in Iraq . At the same time , services to help these women stay off the streets are lagging behind , say several experts who work with veterans ' issues . <p> " With the likelihood of more women veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan with a need for housing , it 's going to be a major , major issue , " says Cheryl Beversdorf , executive director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans , noting that there is n't enough housing to meet even current demands . " The VA is trying to gear up services for women , but frankly it 's not enough given what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the military is female , which partly explains the increase in female veterans and their homelessness . But of the 260 programs in the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans ' network that give counseling , shelter , and other services to homeless veterans , only eight have special programs for women . <p> Existing programs for women are " probably not yet sufficient . There 's not even one in every state , " says Pete Dougherty , director of homeless programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) . <p> He notes , however , that last week the VA announced $12 million in new grants for programs for female , mentally disabled , and elderly veterans - double the current funding for these " special needs " programs . The VA will also fund about 80 additional beds for female veterans in shelters in five states . <p> The transformed role of women in the military , from nursing and administrative positions to the front lines , experts say , is partly responsible for the increased trauma they experience after war - a factor that increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the military is up to four times more likely to be homeless than a nonveteran woman . <p> " Many of the women we see joined the military because they were seeking safety from an abusive step-parent or some sort of sexual abuse , " says Toni Reinis , executive director of New Directions , a residential self-help program for veterans in Los Angeles that has treated an estimated 500 female veterans over the past 13 years . " Often they find the military was not , in fact , a safe place . " <p> For female veterans who find themselves on the streets , the problem of finding an adequate shelter is often compounded by fear of sexual abuse . Only a handful of veterans ' services around the US have special buildings or floors for women , despite the fact that social workers say separate facilities for homeless female vets are crucial for their recovery . " When you talk to women veterans , you 'll hear them clearly say , ' we want a place of our own . ' They do n't feel safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Philadelphia Veterans Multi-service and Education Center . <p> Many women who served in the military do n't perceive themselves as veterans , which can also prevent them from seeking out services , says Ms. Beversdorf . She would like to see the VA undertake a broad-based campaign to educate veterans about their benefits . <p> One of them is Katye Gates , a veteran from Brimfield , Mass. , who served in Iraq for 15 months - running a .50 caliber gunner on more than 180 army convoys . " When I first came back , it was weird because I 'd go to vet centers , and it 's nearly all men there . But I served my country . " <p> Ms. Gates , a single mother who says she had " a hard time getting help " from the VA to find housing when she returned from Iraq , thinks that the department should institute a " buddy system " to pair up female veterans with others like them in their area . <p> The needs of women veterans stretch far beyond that for beds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a VA-funded shelter in Leeds , Mass . " Everything has failed these women , " he adds . " They need to be tethered to VA services for the rest of their lives . They need to be permanently connected to something if they are going to make it . " <p> The VA has no permanent housing program for veterans ; it only funds " temporary transitional " housing programs around the country . The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides housing vouchers to the homeless that are administered by local authorities . The problem , experts say , is there are not enough affordable housing vouchers for all who need them . <p> But " if a woman is a veteran , it actually helps , " says Beversdorf , because being both female and a veteran elevates her status for housing over other applicants . <p> Increasingly , veterans are getting connected to services better than ever before , says Mr. Dougherty . " What we 're finding is that the vet community is being aggressive about trying to find homeless veterans , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via the Internet if they face health or housing problems . <p> Beversdorf agrees that there is " a lot more help out there than there was after the Vietnam War , " in which she served from 1969 to 1971 . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 .
