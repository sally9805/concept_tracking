He was in his world again . He was back . It was high summer coming to fall and Brian was back in the far reaches of wilderness -- or as he thought of it now , home . He had his canoe and bow and matches and this time he 'd added some dried food , beans and rice and sugar . He also had a small container of tea , which he 'd come to enjoy . He had a small cook set , and a can to make little fires in the middle of the canoe ; he put leaves on to make smoke to drive the flies and gnats and mosquitoes away . He had some salt and pepper and , almost a treat , matches . He still could not get over how wonderful it was to just be able to make a fire when he wanted one , and he never sat down to a cook fire without smiling and remembering when his life in the wilderness had begun . His first time alone . He dreamt of it often and at first his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sitting there in the small plane , the only passenger , with the pilot dying and the plane crashing into the lake below . He awakened sometimes with sudden fear , his breath coming fast . The crash itself had been so wild and he had been so out of control that the more he had grown in the years since , the more he had learned and handled difficult situations , the more insane the crash seemed ; a wild , careening , ripping ride down through trees to end not in peace but in the water , nearly drowning -- in the nightmares it was like dying and then not dying to die again . But the bad dreams were rare , rarer all the time , and when he had them at all now they were in the nature of fond memories of his first months alone in the bush , or even full-blown humor : the skunk that hadmoved in with him and kept the bear away ; how Brian had eaten too many gut berries , which he 'd later found were really called chokecherries ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had once landed on his knee to take food from his hand . He had been . . . young then , more than two years ago . He was still young by most standards , just sixteen . But he was more seasoned now and back then he had acted young -- no , that was n't quite it either . New . He had been new then and now he was perhaps not so new . He paused in his thinking and let the outside world come into his open mind . East edge of a small lake , midday , there would be small fish in the reeds and lily pads , sunfish and bluegills , good eating fish , and he 'd have to catch some for his one hot meal a day . Sun high overhead , warm on his back but not hot the way it had been earlier in the week ; no , hot but not muggy . The summer was drying out , getting ready for fall . Loon cry off to the left , not distress , not a baby lost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to evade danger on their own , almost ready to fly , and would not have to ride on their mother 's backs for safety as they did when they were first hatched out . He was close in on the lily pads and something moved suddenly in the brush just up the bank , rustling through the thick , green foliage , and though it sounded big and made a lot of noise he knew it was probably a squirrel or even a mouse . They made an inordinate amount of noise as they traveled through the leaves and humus on the ground . And there was no heavy footfall feeling as there would be with a moose or deer or bear , although bear usually were relatively quiet when they moved . High-pitched screeeeee of hawk or eagle hunting and calling to his or her mate ; he could n't always tell yet between the cry of hawk and eagle . A yip of coyote , not wolf because it was not deep enough , and not a call , not a howl or a song but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before when he 'd watched a coyote hunting mice by a huge old pine log . The log had holes beneath it from one side to the other and the mice could dance back and forth beneath the log through the holes , while the coyote had to run around the end , or jump over the top , and the mice simply scurried back and forth under it to avoid him . The coyote tried everything , hiding , waiting , digging a hole big enough for himself under the log so he could move back and forth , but nothing worked . After over an hour of trying to get at the mice , he finally stood on top of the log looking down one side , then the other , raised his head and looked right at Brian as if he 'd known Brian was there the whole time , and gave an irritated , downright angry yip . It was , Brian felt , a kind of swearing . Up ahead four hundred yards , a moose was feeding in the lily pads , putting its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it would be an easy kill if he wanted it . Canoes seemed such a part of nature to the animals in the wild -- perhaps they thought canoes were logs -- and if a person kept very still it was often possible to glide right up next to an animal near the water . In many states it was illegal to hunt from a canoe for just that reason . Brian had once canoed up next to and touched a fawn standing in the shallows . And with feeding moose it was simpler yet ; all you had to do was scoot forward when the moose had its head underwater and coast when its head was up , looking around . Brian had plenty of arrows : a dozen and a half field points with sixty extra points and a hundred extra shafts and equipment to make more arrows , and two dozen broadhead arrows as well as fifty extra broadhead points with triple-blade heads the military had designed for covert work many years before . These were called MA 3s . Deadly . And if sharpened frequently , they were strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone or miss and catch a rock . Looking at the moose , he salivated , thinking of the red meat and how it would taste roasted over a fire . But then he decided against it . The moose was a small bull , probably only six or seven hundred pounds , and nowhere near the fourteen or fifteen hundred pounds a large bull would weigh , but even so it was a lot of meat to deal with and he could n't bring himself to waste anything he killed . He had gone hungry so long when he had first come to the bush . . . . Food had been everything and the thought of wasting any of it went against every instinct in his body . Even if he made a smoke fire and dried most of it in strips he would still lose some meat . . . . Still , he could see the shot . Close to the moose , close in but far enough away to avoid an attack , the bow already strung . Wait until he ducked under to draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release the MA 3 just in back of the shoulder , under the shoulder blade and the broadhead would go straight into the heart . . . .
