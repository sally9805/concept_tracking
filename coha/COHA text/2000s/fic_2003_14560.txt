( An Iraqi man , Ali , in his late twenties , enters . He is dressed casually , in slacks and a T-shirt . He is balancing a book on his head ) Nowadays you can pick up a book like this for next to nothing . Whole libraries , years and years of careful selection and loving looks , and maybe some reading , set out by the side of the road .. For sale . For next to nothing.Unfortunately I bought this one before . Before . And it cost me . But it was worth it . ( He tilts his head and lets the book drop on the stage ) Books can be used for many things besides reading . ( He gives the book a couple of short , quick kicks ) For exercising the ankles and toes with short , controlled bursts of movement .

Once he told me a joke about rice pudding , two porcupines and a jockstrap ; I laughed so hard I broke a tooth.But this , this is a book on bird fancying as they say in the north of England . It took me ages to understand even though I am fluent in English and have read Macaulay 's speeches in order to really hear the English language . But this was not English . This was north of English and about pigeons and doves . Not stuff for the faint hearted.It is a deadly serious book . One suspects , after fifty pages or so , that in fact it is not a book about keeping birds as a hobby , but something far more .. . important . Like how to keep your lover , or swindle your friends . Or find inner peace.But after one has negotiated , appreciated , and ingested the ins and outs of keeping pigeons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what times we live in : whole libraries for sale , art books , leather bound in Baghdad in the thirties , obstetrics and radiology texts , copies of British Medical Journals .

And all for the price of a few cigarettes  --  considering the times there is only one real rule to keeping pigeons . And this rule , this golden rule is Not in this book : never name a pigeon after a member of your family or a dear friend . ( beat ) For two reasons : pigeons have short lives  --  and when a pigeon named after an uncle dies , this ca n be disconcerting . And second . These times are dangerous for pigeons : they can be caught and eatenAnd cannibalism can put you off a hobby . I began collecting and trading pigeons and doves when I was fifteen . That was more than ten years ago , when birds clustered like flies in the palms along the avenues and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that country ? Back then , everyone could read and when my smallest dove developed a fever , I took her to the hospital , where there was free access to all health care facilities . Parents were fined for not sending their pigeons to school . The basic indicators that you use to measure the overall well-being of flying animals were some of the best in the world . And . And . ( gently but firmly to himself ) Shut up , Ali.One of the birds I called Lak'aa Faseeh Zayer , after my grandmother . A real show off she was . This bird , known as a Feral Pigeon or Rock Dove , I bought off a tradier from North America : Columba Livia , in Latin . It has a white rump and a double black wingbar .

She worked as a maid in a hotel wearing a set of trainers from a Sears Robuck Catalogue a cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got my first pigeon but when I had trouble sleeping she would hold me in her arms and sing to me . Her voice was like an old soft motor , clinking and clanking . Much sweeter than any fruit : ( He sings a short Arab lullabye his grandmother taught him ) She had only three teeth in front but she always said song was not in the tooth but in the roof of the mouth , where God lives . She was also a bit of a blasphemer . Lak'aa Faseeh Zayer was her name . I would write her name down for you but we have no pencils.I became a student when I was seventeen . I had six birds by then . I had one white-winged dove , also imported from America . She I named Greta , after my little sister . My father he loved movies and so my mother named my sister Greta , after Garbo . We were secular , our family . My birds , they were a mix of Christian , Jewish and Muslim . They pulled out each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a little blood but mostly they got along well and crapped in the same pile .

( He stands with one foot off and one foot on ) . Now I am a crooked man , a slanted man . Or to cut it short , for most of the world : an Arab . And I have come here to speak to you about pigeons:My favorite bird is the Zenaida Macroura , or Mourning Dove . It 's name derives from its long , mournful , cooing call , which sounds something like this : ( Makes a very impressive call of the mourning dove ) . The mourning dove is a strong , fast flier that flushes up with a whirring of it 's wings . This first dove I bought , I named after my closest friend , Samir Saboura . We went to grade school together . While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word for the motion of a stone falling ( speaks a made-up word , with confidence ) . The way a fish flicks it 's tail in the water . ( another word ) The sound an apple makes when it 's bit . ( another word ) . Samir Saboura . A strong fast flier that flushed up with a whirring of his wings . My Grandmother , Lak'aa Faseeh Zayer , took care of my pigeons when I was conscripted . Samir and I , we were in Saddam 's army , not the elite Republican Guard , but just the ordinary shock troops . What luck . What luck that we managed to stay together throughout the war . We hid in bunkers for most of those weeks . Cursing Saddam when our captain was out . Cursing the Brits and the Yanks the rest of the time . And I missed my birds . But birds were prohibited in the bunkers . Prohibited . Prohibited by the laws of nations as were the fuel air explosive bombs , the napalm  --  Shhhh !  --  the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs , a 15,000 pound device-Shut up !  --  capable of incinerating every living thing , flying or grounded , within hundreds of yards And me , I missed my birds . The way they looked at me , their eyes little pieces of peace sailing my way.After the war , I sold them one by one , all twelve of them . For food . For aspirin . I sold them . But not before I sold the watch my great Uncle gave me , the spoon my Aunt gave mother , with my name inscribed the day I was born . Not before I sold my Shakespeare , in Arabic , first , then my copies in English . Because I knew . I knew . That my birds would not be shown at the next convention.I remember . I remember . Everything we say these days begins with ' I remember . ' Because the things we saved from the past , we sell day by day for a future in a bucket of slops and potato skins . A bunch of Dole bananas and a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . Only the rich eat fruit . So all we can do is remember . I remember , a few months after the bombing stopped , my grandmother falling on a piece of broken pipe , her thigh cut to the bone . Little pink pills . Little pink pills of penicillin were all she needed . But these were prohibited by the blockade , prohibited for import , as are chemotherapy drugs and painkillers  --  Not again , Ali !  --  ( beat ) Five thousand pigeons die a month because of this blockade . No. ( beat ) Five thousand children die a month because of this blockade I will count to five thousand and then perhaps you will see how many five thousand is . ( Slowly ) One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fourteen . ( beat ) . It takes a long time to count that far.Little pink pills . That was all we needed to save Lak'aa Faseeh Zayer , my grandmother . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist down while the birds disappeared from the avenues because the trees had died . And this ' was the land of dates . How many dates ? How many birds ? ( Slowly ) One , two , three , four . The sadness of numbers is that they do not stop and there is always one more to follow . Just like birds . ( quotes ) Do you ne'er think who made them , and who taughtThe dialect they speak , where melodiesAlone are the interpreters of thought ? ' The Birds of Killingworth ' , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . He was one of Samir 's favorites , along with al-Sayyab , Kanafani and Darwish . And of course , the poets of love . ( beat ) And what of love ? What is a book on the pigeon and the dove if it does not treat the philosophies of love ? Is it in the young boy 's kiss that smells like dust from the dove that has been flying for miles and miles with hunger a sharp blue light across it 's breast , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spine , rolling up and down , dice from the fire ? Is it in the child 's sleep , where death is a butterfly that rests on the finger , then away ? I do n't know ( beat ) I do n't know what love is . It goes . It comes . It goes . It comes . Samir Saboura . My friend . If love is in pieces , then he was a piece of love.Tall , tall , he was . A handsome fellow with big dark eyes but , and I must say it , he walked like a pigeon . Now , pigeons are not really meant to walk . Their state of grace is to fly . But if they must walk , they walk like Samir walked . Like this : ( He walks like Samir , bobbing is head in and out , taking sure but awkward steps ) It 's possible his great x grandfather was a flamingo . Samir . He was intelligent and hilarious , but he had one fault : he could hardly read . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Samir was always carrying a book , and whoever he came upon , he would say " Read to me . " He 'd memorize whole passages that he would recite at the most inopportune of moments . For instance , I had food poisoning when I was sixteen . All day I sat on the toilet , rocking and moaning . And , I must say it , stinking as well . But Samir would not leave my side . He would not leave me to suffer alone . Up and down the hallway outside the bathroom he strode , reciting pieces of Hart Crane . While I sputtered and farted in agony , snatches of The Bridge sailed in and out of my consciousness and kept me from despair : ( He quotes Samir reciting Hart Crane ) " And it they take your sleep away sometimesThey give it back again . Soft sleeves of soundattend the darkling harbour , the pillowed bay . " A good friend , Samir . He had a library that even his teachers envied . He could n't read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Running his big hands over their spines , he would grin at us : " I can not read them , but I can touch them . " He was so intimate with his books that he could close his eyes and find a book by it 's smell . ( He tears a small piece of paper from a book and smells it , then eats it ) Books can also , in extreme times , be used as sustenance . But such eating makes for a parched throat . Many mornings I wake and I am thirsty . I turn on the taps but there is no running water . A once-modern city of three million people , with no running water for years now . The toilets are dry because we have no sanitation . Sewage pools in the streets . When we wish to relieve ourselves , we squat beside the dogs . At night , we turn on the lights to read the books we have forgotten we have sold , but there is no electricity . We go to the cupboard to eat cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cupboards are bare . A couple of us wanted to write a few polite words of complaint to the United Nations Sanctions Committee , but it has blocked the import of pencils as it is feared they might be used for making " weapons of mass destruction . " Just recently it was reported that despite the blockade , at the very tops of some of the most remote mosques , nests have been found made entirely of pencils . ( whispers ) Stockpiling . ( He opens the book again ) Sometimes , if the occasion is right , a book is for reading . ( He snaps the book shut . Then recites quietly ) Some say the world will end in fire , Some say ice.From what I 've tasted of desire , I hold with those who favor fire . Robert Frost . You teach that in school . 88,500 tons of bombs .

Somewhere within this information is a lullabye. ( sings a piece of the Arab lullabye that he sung before . Beat ) . And this , my friends , is documented . Fact . Fact . By the European Parliament , 1991 . Members of the committee recorded the testimony , drinking cups of cold coffee : the defeated troops were surrendering . We , a nation of ' unpeople ' , were surrendering . Samir and myself , along side seven hundred other men . We were dirty and tired and hungry , sucking orange mints because the napalm made our gums bleed . That morning , I 'd relieved myself beside the others while invisible jets broke the black glass sky across the horizon . My friend Samir did the same . And then we walked towards the American unit to surrender , our arms raised beside seven hundred other men . Samir , he said to me  --  this is not documented  --  He said : I want to put my hands in a bucket of cosld water . Shut up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to smell the back of my father 's neck . Shut up , I said . Shut up . We 're almost home . Samir Saboura said " I want to tell an astonishing joke until you cry for relief . " As we walked towards them  --  This is documented  --  the commander of the US unit fired , at one man , an anti-tank missile . A missile meant to pierce armour . At one man . The rest of us , arms still raised , stopped walking . I remember . I remember . I could not . I could not recognize . My friend Samir . A piece of his spine stuck upright in the sand . His left hand blown so high in the air it was still falling . Then they opened fired on the rest of us.A bullet hit me in the back as I ran . Out of hundreds , thousands in that week , a handful of us survived . I lived . ( beat ) Funny . That I am still here . The dead are dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer say goodbye to one another . With the pencils we do not have we write our names so the future will know we were here . So that the past will know we are coming . ( he quotes ) " In a world that seems so very puzzling is it anywonder birds have such appeal ? Birds are , perhaps , the most eloquent expression of reality . " Roger Tory Peterson , American Ornithologist , born 1908. ( he quotes again ) " War is hell . " Pete Williams , Defense department spokesman , on confirming that US army earth movers buried alive , in their trenches , up to 8,000 Iraqi soldiers . ( beat ) Yep . Yep . War is hell . And birds are perhaps the most eloquent expression of reality . In Arabic we say : ( says in Arabic , twice , the equivalent of fuck that. ) . Which is the equivalent of : fuck that.I sold my last bird a few days ago . Tomorrow I will sell the cage . The day after that I will have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers , and who the buyers sell to . I go to their homes and I ask for the bones . Usually the family is kind , or frightened of me , and they give me the bones after the meal . I boil the bones and keep them in a bucket . ( We now notice an old steel bucket that is elsewhere on stage . He takes the bucket ) Listen . ( He shakes the bucket . We hear the sound of bones rattling , though the sound comes not from his bucket but from all around us ) . It is a kind of music . ( He holds the bucket out to the audience ) These are the bones of those who have died , from the avenue of palms , from the land of dates . I have come here to give them to you for safekeeping .
