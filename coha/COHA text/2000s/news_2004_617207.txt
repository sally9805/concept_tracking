<p> New York  --  A cafe customer fed up with cellphone chatter sits in a bubble of blissful silence as nearby patrons puzzle over dead handsets . <p> A man tries to take a secret snapshot with his camera phone but gets only a blank screen . <p> A priest imbues his church with a new energy  --  the electromagnetic kind  --  to keep his sermons free from beeps , chirps and rockin ' ring tones . <p> These are glimpses at a war of gadgets quietly playing out around the world . <p> As millions embrace the freedoms of mobile communications , some people and companies are pushing against the tide . They are fighting technology with technology , using detectors , jammers and other gizmos to defend privacy , security and sometimes sanity . <p> Jamming cellphones is illegal in the United States , but with pocket-sized jammers sold online by foreign companies and even on eBay  --  and the military and government already using such devices  --  the wireless fight is already here . <p> " It 's like the battle between the radar detector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jeff Kagan , an independent telecommunications analyst based in Atlanta . He said the need for such devices is prompted by the " double-edged sword of technology . " <p> " The inventor of the cellphone never thought about the fact that people would be using them constantly and intruding on other people 's privacy , " he said . " The inventor of the camera phone never thought about the fact that they would be used in locker rooms and other inappropriate places . " <p> Jamming a cellphone , essentially a two-way radio , is relatively straightforward . <p> Jammers typically disrupt the communication between handsets and cellular towers by flooding an area with interference or selectively blocking signals by broadcasting on the same frequencies phones use . Some jammers may have to be as smart as cellphones , which try to increase power or hop to other radio channels to avoid interference . <p> Depending on their power , jammers can disrupt communications in an area spanning a few yards or across several miles . <p> Commercial jammers have been sold overseas for years , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Federal Communications Commission prohibits people in the United States from building , selling , operating or importing radio jamming devices . People who violate this provision of a 70-year-old communications law face up to a year in prison and fines of $11,000 for each violation . <p> However , FCC officials say they have received very few complaints about jammed cellphones and have never taken action against anyone for that violation . <p> Those in the jammer industry say individuals use low-powered devices with little fear of reprisals , because it 's difficult , if not impossible , for a caller to distinguish between a jammed signal and a normal cellphone dead zone . <p> The wireless industry says jamming devices endanger the public . <p> " 150 million Americans rely on wireless phones . If those phones are jammed , doctors might miss calls from hospitals or parents could miss emergency calls from baby sitters , " said Travis Larson , spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association . <p> Larson said that in order to cut down on the annoyances of cellphone use , customers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode , voice mail and an on-off button " when appropriate . <p> He said jamming a specific area where silence is expected , such as a movie theater , is still a risk even with warning signs . " Jammers may leak into other adjacent frequency bands , blocking public safety radio signals used by police officers and firefighters , " he said . <p> Silence  --  for $320 <p> But safety concerns , courtesy suggestions and the law have n't stopped people from buying jammers . <p> British firm Global Gadget UK Ltd. sells to people in other countries an array of jamming and detection products , including a portable jammer disguised as a cellphone that can disrupt cellular communication up to 45 feet away . <p> " You will be able to silence those antisocial types who insist on using their mobile phones in the most indiscreet way , " an Internet ad says . " The beauty is that they will not know it is you that has switched them off ! All they will see is that their signal has dropped . " <p> Michael Menage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pocket jammers to people in the United States , his biggest market . Each costs about $320 . <p> " They 're illegal to use over there . People are still quite keen to buy them , " Menage said . He said he has sold to the U.S. military , but most customers are individuals or small businesses tired of cellular distractions . <p> He said some businessmen also use jammers to keep meetings quiet or to disable potential eavesdropping devices , particularly cellphones rigged to be bugs . <p> While also illegal in England , jammers are more widely used in other parts of the world , including the Middle East , Africa , Asia and some parts of Europe . They are blocking phone calls in theaters , restaurants , libraries , prisons and religious buildings like mosques and churches . <p> Jamming has long had a military and security function . <p> Law enforcement officers have used jammers to block mobile communications in dangerous situations , such as isolating hostage-takers or protecting government officials on the move . <p> Jamming is used by U.S. troop convoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some bombs may use cellphones as wireless triggers , and a jamming signal can stop or delay an explosion . <p> Pakistani intelligence officials say jamming devices in the motorcade of President Pervez Musharraf delayed the detonation of a huge bomb that blew up moments after his car passed over a bridge on Dec. 14 . <p> For consumers and businesses , the latest social and technical battlefield is the world of picture phones . The ability to covertly snap and transmit candid images has seemingly overnight blurred the lines between public and private space . <p> About 6 million picture phones were sold to U.S. consumers in 2003 , a number expected to double this year . Overseas sales are far higher . <p> With revealing or embarrassing photos of people appearing on the Internet without their knowledge , locations around the nation have banned camera phones , including many health clubs and schools . Sensitive government and corporate buildings also are trying keep the phones out , and a handful of states are considering new laws to limit their use . <p> A technological countermeasure is on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling out a system called Safe Haven that disables the camera portion of a phone while leaving other functions alone . Locations using such " privacy zones " would broadcast a shutdown signal to specially equipped picture phones or digital cameras . <p> While current models without the receiving technology would not be affected , the brief lifetime of a handset before it is replaced means " it would not take long for all phones on the market to be Safe Haven-approved , " said Patrick Snow , director of Iceberg Systems . <p> He said the company is in negotiations with handset makers , governments and corporations and plans to launch the product this year . He said one large U.S. company is considering an earlier beta test . <p> Other blocking methods <p> Other alternatives are available to block , detect , deter or selectively disable cellphones in ways that avoid breaking the law in some developed nations . <p> No law prohibits blocking signals with thick walls or special metal mesh cages surrounding or built into structures . Some hospitals use such cages to protect sensitive medical equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood paneling infused with magnetic particles that can block radio waves . Japanese researchers , who announced their invention in 2002 , said they hope it will someday be available in hardware stores . <p> BlueLinx Inc. , based in Charlotte , is developing a product called Q-Zone , which tells phones equipped with Bluetooth wireless technology to lower their volume or switch to vibrate when they pass into certain areas , said company Vice President Mary Beth Griffin . <p> Another way to deter cellphone use right now is a cellular detector that flashes lights , sounds an alarm or speaks a polite reminder when it senses an active phone within a certain range . <p> Starport International Ltd. , another British company , distributes the Cellphone Detector Plus , a $450 gadget manufactured by Redmond , Wash. - based Zetron Inc . <p> The devices are used in hospitals , concert halls and theaters , serving as an electronic version of a " no cellphones " sign , said Jonathan Lemel , president of Starport International . He said companies concerned about industrial espionage and the U.S. military also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from disturbances can quickly turn around and affect privacy . <p> Lemel said the detectors can be used in factories or warehouses , where employees are forbidden to make calls during bathroom breaks . The detectors are installed behind a false ceiling with a loud disembodied voice chastising those making calls . <p> " It 's like a voice from on high , " he said . " It has a very good effect , that does . "
