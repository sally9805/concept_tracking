Mike Shultz made his debut in our pages just last month with " Old as Books . " Now he brings us something very different , a delightful literary banquet that , like so many satisfying meals , both leaves us full and makes us look forward to the chef 's next concoction . <p> APERITIF SERVED IN A BATTERED BRASS DECANTER LESTER RUBBED THE LAMP three times . The genie popped out , already blabbering . " Greetings , mortal . I am Jafaar al'Brazier , here to grant you three wishes . The rules are as follows : No wishing for wishes . No rephrasing a wish after - " " Wish number one , " Lester cut in . " No rules . " The genie 's jaw dropped . " Lester , that 's very dangerous . You might - " " Wish number two . Interpret my wishes as I so choose . " The shocked look on the genie 's face grew to superhuman proportions . " Hey , you ca n't - " " Three . " Lester had been saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mole more wishes . That 's 6.02 x 10sup 23 , if you do n't know . " The genie paused , putting a finger to his mouth . " Nobody ever did this before . " A slow grin spread across his face . " Dude ! This could be fun ! Do you mind sharing a few ? " SALAD ROMAINE LEAVES LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE A SKIRT OUT OF , TOPPED WITH SLICES OF APPLE Adam Pherstman and Evelyn Childs worked like the devil to keep Darwin 's Hope , the Federation 's Multiverse-Class Colony Ship , from crashing into the planet below , but the accident left the ship 's systems in tatters . They ran for the Ejecto-Pod as the ship plummeted into the blue and white sphere below . They were the last survivors . seconds after they ejected , Darwin 's Hope crashed into a barren region that , according to the Quantum Flux Possible Future Predictor , could one day be called Arizona , or possibly Roswell . It made quite a crater . The Pod landed halfway around the planet at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in hand ( the ordeal had brought them quite close together ) into a lush green garden . Finding it hot compared to home , they removed their clothing and went off to explore . The garden was wonderful . The only trouble came when Adam climbed a tree to pick some fruit - a talking snake bit him . Luckily , Eve spotted it slithering away and vaporized it with her Phase Blaster . They had a moment of friction when Adam returned to the Pod and refused to let her help him treat his wound , - he came back out looking paler than normal , but claimed he was okay . That evening , they cuddled up next to a fire . " Let 's just stay here and have lots and lots of kids , " Eve said , a starry look in her eyes . Adam frowned . " Ah , Eve - " " Just think ! " Eve went on . " We might populate this whole world ! " " There 's only one problem , " Adam said with a gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bit me in a bad place . " Eve 's eyes widened . " You mean - " Adam pulled out the Quantum Predictor , hit a few buttons , and showed her the screen . YOU GUYS SURE SCREWED THAT ONE UP , it read . ENTRE ROASTED WHITE MEAT , PREPARED ONA SPIT Dr. Jules landed himself in quite a pickle when he jumped back to ancient Central America in the Company 's Quantum Flux Time Machine . He nearly tricked the Maya out of all their gold , trading it for Bic lighters and Cheez Whiz , when he made the mistake of shaking the chief 's hand . Next thing he knew he was tied to a sacrificial altar . Jules was terrified . But his MicroGizmo(TM) watch saved the day , piping up to inform him of the impending lunar eclipse . " You kill me and I 'll steal the moon ! " he shouted at the chief , who understood him thanks to Jules 's Phase Inversion Language Translator . The chief frowned and consulted with his high priests . Finally , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought you were Quetzlcoatl , " the chief said , grinning sheepishly . " We were going to sacrifice you and steal your powers . But you do n't even know that lunar eclipses are caused by the occultation of the Moon by the Earth . You 're not a god . " The chief turned to one of the priests . " Start the fire ! We 're having him for dinner ! " SIDE DISH STEAMED RUTABAGAS SERVED IN A HOLLOWED SKULL Olric stifled a yawn as he swung his two-handed vorpal sword onehanded through the necks of another dozen goblins . The army around him dwindled rapidly . He saw the Goblin King , Groog , approaching proudly but fearfully on his horse , and rolled his eyes , meanwhile slaughtering another hundred goblins . Groog drew near and dismounted . " Enough ! " Groog boomed . " I 've had it ! " Olric looked around . The remaining goblins quieted and lowered their weapons . " Okie , I quit , " Groog said , throwing down his battleaxe . " This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come on ! " Okie whined . " This has been ... " He struggled for a word . " Challenging ? " " No . I 'm finished . No more wars . " Groog turned on his heel as if to walk away . " Wait ! " Okie looked around , frantic . " I 'll ... I 'll take off my armor . See ? " He shucked his magical plate mail ( very easy to remove ) and tossed it aside . Groog looked at him askance . " Nah , " he said , waving Okie off . " Okay , uh ... I 'll put down my vorpal sword ! " He threw it at his feet . Groog raised an eyebrow . " Your prophylactic of protection plus nine ? " Okie reddened . " Fine . " He slipped it off and tossed it away . " Now , fight me ! " " No . " Groog signaled to a goblin behind Okie , who fired his readied crossbow . The bolt sank into Okie 's back . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Groog picked up the vorpal sword and finished the job . " Works every time , " Groog said . DESSERT MINCEMEAT PIE , STILL WARM The beautiful and voluptuous special agent Jane Craft clung to the helicopter 's skid with one arm and glared up at the pilot , the Arch-Evil Doctor Shovanyst . He was a goner , now . She swung her M submachine gun toward him . " I know you 're the one who gassed London ! " Jane shouted . " Now you 'll pay ! " " I might as well confess , " Shovanyst said . " You 're dead anyway . " He jerked the controls . Jane 's M went flying as she struggled to keep her grip . Shovanyst cackled madly and veered off toward Paris . Undaunted , Jane did a knee-hang from the skid , silently thanking her MI-6 gymnastics instructor , and pulled her Beretta 70S from her ankle holster . Then she shimmied back to the cockpit opening . " Still with us ? " Shovanyst said . He rolled the helicopter upside-down , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the craft . Jane toppled sideways but snagged the skid once more . Her Beretta plummeted to the ground . " Phew , " Jane said . " Close one . " She crouched on the upside-down rail , trying not to look into the spinning rotors below . " Really glad I took those gymnastics classes , " she said to herself as she pulled out a .44 Auto-Mag from the holster at the small of her back . Jane aimed at Doctor Shovanyst and pulled the trigger . The gun 's kick knocked her off balance ; if not for her large breasts adding to her instability , she might have recovered . Jane fell , but not far . The rotors carved her into tiny bits . SWEET DREAMS WITH A FULL BELLY MARRED BY A TOUCH OF INDIGESTION The succubus had Donald tied to the bed . When he laid eyes on her , sweet blissful anticipation filled him , but when their bodies touched , it was hot coals and burning needles in places where coals and needles were n't meant to go . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went for hours . " Wait , " Donald said , panting , as they cycled into another phase of blissful anticipation . " Why are you doing this to me ? " " Temptation , " the succubus growled in her sultry voice . " Sin . Keeping you out of heaven . " " Look , honey . I drink , smoke , cheat on my taxes , cheat on my wife .... I 'm already going to hell . You 're wasting your time . " The succubus sat back on the bed , a pout on her face . " Fine . Be that way . I hate this job , anyway . " " Now , now , " Donald cooed , switching on the charm that had won him a dozen mistresses . " Why do n't you untie me , skip the hot coals , and we do this just for fun ? " The succubus grinned a toothy grin . Donald 's blissful anticipation rose to gargantuan heights as the sulfurous smell in the air diminished and she untied him . He shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his screams all the way down to the 663rd layer of the abyss .
