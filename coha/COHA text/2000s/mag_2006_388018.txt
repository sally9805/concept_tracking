. As Ryder Cup captain , Ian Woosnam knew he would n't win any points by being smooth . When Welshman Ian Woosnam won the Masters in 1991 , a British reporter asked him , " What do you say to those people who say you are a one-hit wonder ? " " They can all go and get stuffed , " Woosie snapped . The first question fired at him after Europe triumphed at the Ryder Cup at the K Club was : " What are you feeling like now that you 've won ? " " I 'm feeling like I want a pint of Guinness , " said Woosnam . That 's just the way Boozie Woosie , as the British tabloids call him , goes about life . Leaning over the balcony of the K Club , Woosnam sculled that much-craved pint in one gulp , egged on by Darren Clarke and the throng below . " Boozie Woosie 's Barmy Army , " they chanted . Woosie 's more ambitious attempt to down a magnum of champagne failed in an aural and nasal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woosnam 's palate , but this display of frat-house binge drinking is precisely why the Europeans have a stronger bond than the Americans . Can you really see Tiger , Phil and Tom Lehman wearing green wigs and behaving like students at a toga party ? Woosnam is an old-style , plain-talking , lovable British sporting hero who made it to No. 1 in the world in the days before sports psychologists . Woosnam mucked in ( and mucked out ) on his father 's farm in Oswestry for six months after leaving school before turning professional in 1976 with an unusually high handicap of 1 . He qualified for only five events in two years , winning just 284 . To save costs he drove around Europe in a camper van he shared with a fellow struggling tour pro . They survived for weeks by heating up baked beans on a gas stove  --  a golf version of Blazing Saddles meets Brokeback Mountain . Thirty years down the road , Woosnam , now 48 , has won 44 times around the world ( with 158 top 10s and 27 runner-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 500 tournaments . Woosnam was a cornerstone of Europe 's Big Five ( along with Nick Faldo , Seve Ballesteros , Sandy Lyle and Bernhard Langer ) , who so dominated the majors and the Ryder Cup from the mid-1980s through the ' ' 90s . He starred in eight Ryder Cups , from his first in 1983 to 1997 , and at the K Club captained the European team to its third-consecutive victory . " The greatest week in history , " he said , putting the origins of the universe and V-E Day firmly in their place . Woosnam had to stop being one of the lads to accept the formal responsibilities of being Ryder Cup captain . But the politician part of the job did not suit him . He twitched and stuttered and sweated his way through press conferences , looking like a turkey caught in the headlights of a Hummer . Standing in the rain at the K Club with his shoulders hunched , head bowed and hands stuffed inside his pockets , Woosnam looked like a late-night reveler waiting for the last bus home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the smooth-talking , suit-wearing Tom Lehman and his team-bonding barbecues . But once the matches began , the tension disappeared from Woosnam 's brow and he revealed his fighter 's game face . On the eve of the Ryder Cup , Woosnam said , " I 'll do it the Ian Woosnam way , which is normally aggressive . " And afterward , for the first time in history , the winning captain invited his opponents to the victory party . " If we ca n't beat " em , we might as well join " em , " said a bleary-eyed Lehman . " Woosie 's a heck of a guy . " PULLQUOTE " The greatest week in history , " said Woosie . BOX GET MORE SCOOP !
