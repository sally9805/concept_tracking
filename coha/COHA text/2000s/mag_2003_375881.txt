At a time when tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia were flaring in public , President Bush was busy behind the scenes building a new antiterrorist task force with the kingdom 's rulers . The plan started as Bush was refusing to release 28 pages of the 9/11 congressional report made public in July  --  pages that allegedly detail how financial networks in Saudi Arabia have funded terrorism . He argued that releasing them would " help the enemy " by revealing how U.S. intelligence gathers information . <P> That did not go over well in Riyadh  --  or with Saudi critics in the U.S. The Saudis demanded that the material be released to make it clear that , as Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal put it , " We have nothing to hide . " Sources tell TIME that around the time Bush decided to withhold the 28 pages , he telephoned Crown Prince Abdullah and had a cordial chat with the de facto Saudi ruler . Bush brushed aside the controversy and , wanting the two countries to move forward , told Abdullah he would send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush 's envoys on Aug. 5 in his As-Salaam palace in the Red Sea port of Jidda just as the afternoon call to prayer sounded . The U.S. group , led by the National Security Council counterterrorism chief , Frances Townsend , soon launched into a parley on the touchy topic . Townsend wanted more cooperation ; Abdullah suggested a joint task force . The envoys seized the unexpected offer . <P> Sources tell TIME that a group of FBI and IRS agents are scheduled to fly to Riyadh this week to start work at a joint center that could one day house two dozen financial experts . " It 's difficult to overestimate the potential value of this joint effort , " says Treasury general counsel David Aufhauser , the top U.S. official dealing with terrorist finances . The Saudis seem to have plenty to offer . They have arrested or killed some 200 al-Qaeda suspects since the May 12 Riyadh bombing that took 35 lives and have found documents , including financial records , that could provide useful leads .  --  By Adam Zagorin      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
