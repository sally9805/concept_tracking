<p> WASHINGTON  --  Spurred by the threat of terrorism and the prospect of war , the federal government is embarking on the most ambitious effort to train and prepare its citizens for the worst since the civil-defense programs of the 1950s and ' 60s . <p> Only this time , Americans are n't just being told to duck and cover . <p> The Department of Homeland Security is urging people to prepare home disaster kits . Emergency preparedness officials are loading private and government Web sites with instructions for surviving chemical and biological attacks . Schools are being encouraged to develop emergency plans . Corporate CEOs are being forewarned about protecting workers and buildings . <p> And next week , the new department will launch a massive new public-education campaign to try to further educate citizens about preparing for a possible terrorist attack . It 's all part of an effort to answer people 's questions " in a way that educates and does not alarm , " says Tom Ridge , secretary of Homeland Security . <p> The department is also promoting citizen training . In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism , citizens groups are multiplying across the country . Citizen Corps councils , which train volunteers , have been established in 335 communities . The government says more than 200,000 volunteers have been trained in first aid , fire suppression and search-and-rescue operations so they can help their neighbors before firefighters and medical teams arrive . Officials aim to have 400,000 more trained by the end of this year . <p> It 's all part of an effort by the nation 's new homeland-security bureaucracy to tamp down the terror and get people psychologically and practically prepared for disaster . <p> " It 's a cultural change and a behavioral change that we 're trying to create , " says Jackie Snelling , the volunteer leader of citizen-training efforts in Arlington , Virginia . " The basic message is : Who 's responsible in an emergency ? You are . " <p> A half-century ago , the threat of a nuclear strike prompted the government to try preparing the public for a different kind of attack . Then , schoolchildren were told to crawl under desks during air-raid drills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive an atomic blast . Families were encouraged to build bomb shelters in their backyards . <p> The government 's civil-defense efforts were ridiculed as an absurd response to the prospect of nuclear annihilation . Andrew Grossman , author of Neither Dead nor Red : Civilian Defense and American Political Development During the Early Cold War , says the goal was as much to " explain the government 's view on the Cold War " as to prepare citizens for disaster . <p> Learning from Israel <p> Today , the nation is seeking guidance from countries such as Israel , England , Spain , Germany and Italy , where residents have lived with the threat of terrorism for decades . In Israel , children are educated about the risks , families have emergency plans in place , and apartment and office buildings are equipped with sealed " safe rooms " where people can ride out a chemical attack . <p> Those nations offer good examples of how to function under the threat of terrorism . But Ridge says the United States will never look like Israel , where armed guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to put their bags through X-ray machines ? " I do n't think so , " he says . <p> Randall Larsen , director of the ANSER Institute for Homeland Security , likens the government 's push for citizen preparedness to the training given soldiers heading into combat . Vietnam-era prisoners of war , he notes , reported that their training helped them know what to expect once they were captured . That knowledge helped make the experience easier . " Psychologically preparing the public is very important , " Larsen says . <p> Paul DeVito , director of the Early Responders Distance Learning Center at Saint Joseph 's University in Philadelphia , says studies show that getting prepared helps alleviate people 's fears . <p> " What causes terror , for the most part , is fear of the unknown , or fear of the known that is uncontrollable , " he says . " The more that we 're prepared , the less terror people will feel . " <p> While the government 's citizen-preparedness crusade is new , its effort to train citizens as volunteers has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups throughout the country , they are taught how to help in the minutes or hours before firefighters and other emergency workers can respond to a disaster . <p> The training program has run into trouble in Congress . Citing a tight budget , lawmakers this week scaled back Bush 's 2003 budget request from nearly $ 200 million to just $ 20 million . But most local leaders vow to continue with local government and private money . <p> Sue Nogas says she signed up to become a member of her neighborhood 's Community Emergency Response Team because she " felt pretty helpless " on Sept. 11 as she watched a black cloud drift over the Pentagon . Today , the Arlington , Va. , resident , 40 , has taken about 20 hours of evening and weekend classes . She 's learning how to rescue victims trapped in debris , identify those with the most serious injuries , stabilize them until help arrives and put out small fires . <p> Last Saturday 's class was about fire suppression . Two volunteer firefighters spent about three hours teaching Nogas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuels them and how to put them out . <p> In a disaster , there 's " only so much the fire department can get to , " instructor Paul Schomburg said . <p> Team members also were instructed when to walk away . In this case , it was when they see diamond-shaped hazardous-materials placards . The mantra for team leaders is that volunteers should never become part of the problem by getting involved in dangerous situations they 're not equipped to handle . " You 're no good to anyone if you 're dead or injured , " Nogas says . <p> Assuming she passes this weekend 's final exam  --  a mock disaster in which volunteers must do basic medical triage , put out a fire and conduct search-and-rescue drills  --  Nogas will be ready to help in an emergency . She 's already got her goggles , work gloves and the green hard hat that will identify her as a trained volunteer to police and fire officials . <p> Terry Dee , who runs citizen-training efforts in southern Arizona , says the classes provide an outlet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group now has 100 residents in training and 900 more who have signed up on the Internet . " We want to be able to train the citizenry to be prepared for anything , " Dee says . " Maybe it 's a terrorist attack , but maybe it 's a chemical truck driving down the road that gets hit by a bus . " <p> ' Like chicken soup ' <p> Critics of the government 's current preparedness crusade say it needlessly scares people and does n't address the real threat to the nation 's security : a lack of government funding for firefighters and other emergency workers . <p> " They have to do a lot more than tell people that the responsibility is now on their shoulders , " Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle , D-S.D. , says . <p> Education officials also have complained about a lackluster effort by the government to help schools shore up security . Earlier this week , the National Association of School Resource Officers , which represents more than 10,000 school police officers , urged Congress to give schools money and guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much like our airports and our buildings should have been on someone 's radar screen before 9/11 because we had credible intelligence , we 're saying that you 've got to put schools on this radar screen now , not after something happens , " said the group 's director , Curt Lavarello . <p> Grossman , who is also a civil-defense expert at Albion College , says there 's little evidence that preparing the public would help lessen the effects of a terrorist attack . <p> " Does civil defense work after an attack ? Probably not if it 's a weapon of mass destruction , because people will panic , " he says . But ultimately , Grossman says , civil preparedness " is like chicken soup . It ca n't really hurt .
