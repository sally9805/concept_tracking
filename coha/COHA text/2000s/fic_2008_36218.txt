Had Columbus my gut , the world would be a smaller place . And maybe the better for it . O brave new world : wild , rebellious , mysterious , and strange . And distant . God above , who knew it could be so bloody far ? <p> Now begins a gentleman 's exile , and , with it , my tale . <p> You may wonder , dear Reader , dear , unfathomable Reader , why I have undertaken this voyage , why a man of parts , of fine parts , I may say , and education , better than most , would hazard a crossing and that , in April , the most treacherous of months-showers sweet turn to tempests bitter-and , worse , on a galleon with no berth for a gentleman but a bunk not fit for a dog , not even my mastiff , Gulliver-and I , though six foot tall , his Lilliputian-who , despite my best efforts , splays himself , fleas and all , atop my moth-ridden blanket , with me huddled under it , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with cauldrons of drool , besieging me . While you wonder why I wander , know this : run I must . <p> Aye , I would have stayed home if I could . If I could . Instead , each day the winds blow me farther from the dales and vales of Jamesons past , clan of clans , men among men , though , truth be told-and here , dear Reader , it will be told , and without ornament-our tartan is sold by the yard at Covent Garden to every shaver , ever striver , every waster with two pence in his pocket and a plan to marry a merry widow with ten thousand a year and an estate in Derbyshire , with horses , comely , and tenants , timely in their rents . Had I ever come across such a lady-let us call her the Widow Bountiful-I would have wooed her with sighs enough to heat a stone-cold bed-chamber in the dead of winter . Perhaps she waits for me , my Widow B. , somewhere on the other side of this wretched sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' t is only Gulliver , giant cur . <p> As a man of both sense and sincerity , I admit , freely , and with that same unsparing candor which you must henceforth expect of me , that I leave behind little but debt . T would be an even greater sorrow to leave Edinburgh , that nursery of enlightened genius , did not each degree of longitude stretch the distance betwixt me and my creditors , to whom I owe so much gold , and so little gratitude , the brothers McGreevy , with their Monday duns , Tuesday threats , and Wednesday bludgeons . Suffice to say : I sailed on a Thursday , a day too late , with the scars to show for it . Departed , the Sea-Serpent , April 5 , 1764 . <p> Sterner men on stouter ships have crossed this vast and furious ocean , training their hopeful gaze upon the horizon ; I , ever squeamish , scan only the depths and see naught but gloom . I would blind myself-and spare you the sight-but I find , as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the blue sloshes into green , and there , gray , and just here , as I lean over the gunwales , lo but the ocean becomes a rainbow of muck , a palette of putrefaction . The lurching , the To and the Fro , are my twin tormentors ; and the sea , my sewer and my jailer . <p> Wheel of Fortune , pray , turn : let some young Bluebeard take the Sea-Serpent as his prize . Let his pirates throw me overboard . Let them haul me ' neath the keel and drown me . Sweet Jesus , just get me off this ship . Captain Pumble , a bulge-eyed , blotchy frog of a man , hops about the deck , uncloaked , even against the fearsome wind , as I , shivering , lean over the rails once again . He tells me that Boston will be temperate by the time we dock . <p> " Yar , ' twill be blooming in the city , " croaks he , clapping me on the back , as jolly as if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . " Ladies walking about without shawls . And a dandy , and a Scots gent , no less , will be most welcome by the lasses . Or is it the gents you favor , Jameson ? " <p> Between you and me , Reader : this Pumble has not entirely earned my affection . <p> " At the moment , Captain , " I manage to reply . " I favor deep pockets . Deep pockets , and solid ground . " <p> It is customary , at this point in a narrative of a gentleman 's adventures in the world , be he knave or rogue , to offer a pedigree . So be it . <p> The brown hound that whelped my Gulliver belonged to a butcher who cut meat for the Laird of Firth , a corpulent and stingy man-for I find that podginess and parsimony generally travel together-who claimed that his mastiffs were descended from the kennel of the Kubla Khan , brought West by Marco Polo , and on down , across the generations , to the court of Henry VIII and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Laird fed his dogs better than most gentlemen feed their valets . But the old miser-too cheap to pay for the meat-instead gave the butcher his best bitch , her belly swollen with pups who , once weaned , nearly ate the butcher out of his shop . Cheated and bested , he returned the litter to the Laird . T was then came I to town , to paint a portrait of the Laird and his favorite dog , a beast as big as himself , with teeth a sailor might scrimshaw . The subject would have defeated even my friend Gainsborough . My portrait , a study in Venetian red , caught the Laird 's greed in his ruddy cheeks , his bleary eyes , his dog 's great maw . Alas , rarely does a man love his true self . Seeing his and his mascot 's likeness so well captured displeased this gentleman , who refused to pay the balance of my fee , instead tendering a black-and-white pup , the runt of the litter , though as tall at the withers as a lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sired by gullibility , son of a butcher 's bitch . <p> A devil 's bargain , you might think , Reader : ' t was either the cur , or naught . Would you deny me the dog 's company ? Surely my exile would be even lonelier had I forfeited my fee . And be forewarned : I have made worse bargains . <p> Chapter Two In Which Our Author Secures a Situation in a City on a Hill <p> As Pumble navigated the Sea-Serpent through the harbor-I craving land more than poor , scurvy Magellan ever did , and Gulliver , galumphing about deck , in a frenzy of anticipation-we sailed past a chain of small islands , perfect refuges for pirates . <p> " Are you quite sure we wo n't run aground , Captain ? " I ventured , for , though the day was clear and the water calm , we tacked perilous close to the isles . <p> " I could put you at the helm , if you like , Jameson . Got the sea in your blood , eh ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you sorry Scot . Rest easy . I wo n't smash her to bits . Though this shallow harbor has wrecked many a ship , I do n't mind saying . " <p> " Shallow , Captain ? " I asked nervously . <p> " Yar , she 's deep enough for the Sea-Serpent , but New York , where I 'm bound , has deeper . Which is why that city builds banking houses , while this here Boston builds churches . " He nodded toward the town-cut against the sky , as if in silhouette-and pointed out the North Church , with its proud wooden spire , the tallest among a thicket of steeples . Prim , pious , and provincial . Trim , trim , and tidy , all . <p> " Ah , well then , " I answered , brightening . " T is proved : a merchant measures his prospects by a port 's fathoms and not by its people 's piety , just as a whore measures a man 's parts by the bulge of his purse and not of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a mincing smile . <p> Mark me , dear Reader : bidding my captain farewell will not break my heart . <p> Closer to shore , I spied people bustling about-along streets riddled with ruts and gutters of mud and manure whose stench reached us even before we docked-everyone hurrying , but at a trot and not a gallop . Here is no London , where men race as foxes chased by hounds . Here is a place where , pray God , I can stand still . <p> I put on my hat , left my bags on board , and stepped ashore . Stumbling about the dock , my spirits soon improved , and my gut seemed to slow and finally halt its orbit round my middle . Along what is called the Long Wharf , I found a tavern , the Blue Herring , and I quaffed . Say I : there is fine beer here , brewed , I am told , by a man named Adams , in barrels built of the pine woods of New Hampshire . Steadied , fortified , I took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this : if there is nothing elevated and fine in the town of Boston , there is little to be found that is particularly unpleasant , save the restraint of the townspeople , who stare at strangers-even at a tall , brass- buttoned Scottish gentleman , and likelier than most-with a coldness that runs to cruelty . <p> I next made my way west along King Street , cluttered with shops , though whether this ambitious avenue is a credit to our third George in this , the fifth year of his reign , I could not claim . The trade seemed lackluster at best . Along a street called Cornhill , I saw an utter desolation : the ruins of dwelling-houses , stores , and shops , burned in a fire that looked to have raged some winters ago , in a city too straitened to rebuild . <p> Just in front of a brick building called the Town House , which sits in the very middle of King Street , I found a spindle-shanked boy , no more than ten , peddling salted cod wrapped in old newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish , lad , " I said to him . " But be so good as to tell me where I might find fresher news than what 's printed in your wrappers . " <p> He directed me up an alley dubbed Crooked Lane-though all the streets here would equally well bear that name-to a dark , cluttered print shop whose stink made my eyes to tear ere I crossed the threshold . ( My father had once wanted to apprentice me to an engraver , Reader , but I forswore the trade just as soon as I learned that every printer washes his plates in his own water . I would not toil in a piss-house . ) <p> Behind the counter , tinkering with types , stood a man of about my own age , wise-eyed and wigless , his face as flat and round as the moon , his ginger hair tied back . From this gentleman , Mr. Benjamin Edes , I purchased a deck of cards , a map , and , for five shillings , a rather windy history of the town , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Boston 's founder , a proper Puritan named John Winthrop , proclaimed to his followers in 630 , as they neared shore : " We shall be as a City upon a Hill , the eyes of all people are upon us ; so that if we shall deal falsely with our God , we shall be made a story and a byword through the world . " <p> Now , careful Reader , I ask you this : From such a lofty start , can any city do less than fall ? T is a small port , and charming enough . But it does not content itself with its smallness , its slack bustle , its less-than profound harbor . Nay , ' t would be Jerusalem . Here is a town that , by pretending to be more than it is , makes itself less . I had rather not draw an overhasty conclusion . But I have to wonder whether this is what hobbles Boston : its oversized ambition . The very opposite of what hobbles me . <p> While the printer tallied my items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice-weekly newspaper , the Boston Gazette , and flipped to its back pages , filled with advertisements : " A fine Negro Male Child to be given away . It has been kept remote from the Small-Pox . " " To be SOLD : The very Best Vinegar for Pickles . " " RAN AWAY from his Master : A stout Irish servant . " <p> " Are you looking for something else , sir ? " Edes asked . <p> " Aye . My bearings . " <p> " Just landed , I take it ? If you do n't mind my saying , sir , you 're still a bit green about the gills . " <p> " Green 's an improvement , I assure you , " was my smiling reply . " Aye , I 'm just in , from Edinburgh . " <p> " It 's as well you ai n't come from London , sir , else you 'd bring bad tidings , sure . " <p> I gave him a puzzled expression . <p> " You would n't have heard , sir , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament voted as you set sail , and the news washed up on our shores the day before you did . I 'm just now setting the type to put it in Thursday 's edition . Bastards mean to tax us to pay for their war , what 's ended not a twelvemonth ago , with the French and the Indians . Tax our sugar , they will . Worse : we ai n't allowed to pay with our own paper money . Coin of the realm , it has to be . I ask you , sir , who has hard money in these hard times ? And mind , they promise , next , to tax with stamps our every piece of paper ! " <p> " I 'm sorry to hear it , " I offered , and sincerely . I liked this plainspoken printer , and admired his argument , for the town looked poor enough already . <p> " Not so sorry as you 'll be when the shops start closing , for ai n't we struggling , after seven years of war ? But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and English taxes . " <p> " Aye , that you do n't , " I agreed . " My grandfather fell at Culloden . But I trust you colonials will protest these measures . For as I always say , an empty stomach has a loud mouth . " <p> " Ai n't heard that one afore , sir , and ' t is true enough , " he said , flashing a smile . " But we wo n't be laughing when the King sends over his redcoats , those lobsterbacked sons of bitches ! Their fingers will be in our purses soon enough . There 's only so much a free people will bear , I tell you , and only so far the hand of tyranny can stretch , ere its reach exceeds its grasp . " <p> I shook my head , and pushed back my hat . <p> " Edes , your metaphors alarm me . Many 's the hand I would welcome in my pocket , " I said with a wink . " But not the hand of tyranny . " <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrained . <p> " Say , Edes , do you get any Scottish papers here ? " <p> " Indeed , sir . When traveling gentlemen bring them by . You 'll have no trouble hearing news from home . Old news , mind , but news just the same . " <p> Reader , this news of news is good and bad . Maybe I have n't fled far enough . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
