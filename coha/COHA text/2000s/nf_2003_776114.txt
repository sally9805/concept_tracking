Crazy by Design // The New Science of the Teenage Brain // Teen . Brain . Brain . Teen . The words , I concede , go more tongue in cheek than hand in hand . Utter them out loud-mention even that you 're writing a book on the teenage brain-and the jokes come popping out , like pimples before a prom . // " What ? They have one ? " // " Short book . " // Steve , the father of two teenage boys , shook his head and wished me luck . As far as he could tell , the teenage brains he knew had recently and inexplicably gone berserk. // " I do n't get it , " he said . " All of a sudden strange things are happening with the kids we know . These are good kids , bright kids , but the other day one stole some calculators from the high school and sold them , another ca n't finish any homework . Getting my own kids out the door in the morning now is this monumental thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer and the mother of two lovely teenage boys , was ferocious . // " Teenage brain ? I 'll tell you teenage brain , " she told me one morning . " You know my thirteen-year-old ? Well , he went to the school dance , and the rule is you have to stay inside and you ca n't leave . But he and his friends decided they were imprisoned , and so they went outside and ran in a big circle around the gym . Who knows what they were thinking , but the principal found out and called my husband at home . The next day , we talked and talked ; we told him he had to apologize , that he had inconvenienced everyone . But he just could n't get it ; he could n't get outside himself to understand things from someone else 's point of view . " // And what was next from this thirteen-year-old , a straight-A kid who never caused a speck of trouble before and who , as his mother says , " used to be so meticulous and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from work and found three letters waiting for her : One said her son had , as expected , been put on the honor roll , the second said he 'd made all-county orchestra , and the third said he was being suspended from school after being caught hanging around downtown when he was supposed to be in history class . // " You look at them and sometimes they 're so articulate and they seem so grown up and you think they have all the pieces , but sometimes they just do n't , " said Denise . " I have to say that I believed , smugly , that only irresponsible , self-absorbed jerks had children who got into trouble . But something always happens . It 's annoying ; it 's scary ; it can make you crazy . " // As the mother of two teenage girls , I do n't quibble with this . Annoying stuff happens , scary stuff happens . It can make you crazy . // One morning not long ago my oldest daughter , then fifteen , got up ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room and lugged her laundry to the washing machine . // Then , as the rinse cycle whirred and we talked in the living room-I suggested that it was n't such a great idea to take her new CD player to an amusement park with water rides-she morphed , she mutated . Shooting up off the couch-in full-tilt pubescent display-she stomped upstairs , flinging over her shoulder the battle cry of the teenage warrior goddess , circa 2003 : " You suck ! " // The world , of course , has been trying to figure out teenagers for centuries . Their behavior has baffled the best of our thinkers . Aristotle said teenagers appeared " fickle in their desires , " which are as " transitory as they are vehement . " Shakespeare , Romeo and Juliet aside , described adolescence as largely a time for " getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting . " And , if he spoke of their brains at all , which was rare , he dismissed them as " boiled . " // The first whiff from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Rhona , the mother of two teenagers in New Jersey , knew her daughter Susannah was a teenager simply because she " became embarrassed about the music I had on in the car . " Bill , the father of two teenage girls in a small town in New York , says he knew adolescence had arrived when one of his daughters did n't speak to him for a week . Ron , the father of four teenagers in Phoenix , always knew one of his kids had hit adolescence when they started spending a lot of time in the bathroom . // Other times , the whiffs become shock waves . // One father in Minneapolis was aghast when his straitlaced son was caught painting graffiti on the side of a store ; a mother in Princeton got a call one spring afternoon from the local police who said her well-behaved fourteen-year-old daughter had stolen a T-shirt from the mall ; a mother and father were in tears when their beautiful fifteen-year-old daughter sneaked out her window at midnight to meet a twenty-four-year-old man she 'd just met. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin boys , the adolescent wave that swept into her house was abrupt , swift , and " horrible . " It arrived about the time her sons were in the seventh grade . " To me it was a return to the terrible twos , " she told me . " The tantrums , the stomping of feet , the slamming of doors , the fighting , the name-calling , the animalistic behavior . All of a sudden they got very good at evasive behavior , experts at keeping secrets . Their rooms were a mess , their bodies were clean but they had laundry all over the floor . They became very rude and the self-involvement was breathtaking . It was cosmos-annihilating narcissism , that 's what it was . " // One son tiptoed out of the family 's apartment late at night and somehow got himself to New Jersey with his friends ; the other-both boys are quite smart-was caught after he hacked into a university computer system . One-no need to say which-managed to make LSD in the high school science lab. // " Believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew all about how teenagers were supposed to be , but still , it knocked me out . " // Teenagers themselves are often surprised at how rapidly their world changes , in all sorts of ways . Lisa , a fourteen-year-old girl from Minneapolis who plays lacrosse and actually likes studying Latin , told me it seemed that " all of a sudden " her moods " were all over the place . " // " Sometimes , I just get overwhelmed now , " she said . " There 's all this friend stuff and school and how I look and my parents . I just go in my room and shut the door . My parents want to talk to me , and I do n't mean to be mean , but sometimes I just have to go away and calm down by myself . " // This is not to say that all teenagers are alike . Parents often describe at least one child , more if the gods smiled , who just seemed to sail through adolescence . But for most teenagers , blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hormonal lands , something usually happens , nothing malicious , nothing illegal , just something . // " I get in trouble a lot more now , but it 's for stuff I really did n't mean , " said Martin , fifteen . " I forget to call home . I do n't know why . I just hang out with friends , and I get involved with that and I forget . Then my parents get really mad , and then I get really mad , and it 's a big mess . " // What 's Going On ? // So what 's really happening ? Why do normal , well-behaved teenagers start pouting in their rooms , sneaking out windows , stomping their feet , or making LSD in the school science lab ? For many years , the answer had been simple : hormones , the raging hormones of adolescence . // I remember , not long ago , going to an orientation for my daughter when she was entering sixth grade , and listening to the white-haired principal get a good laugh when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on folding chairs : " Do n't worry , we know that all the growth in these middle school years goes on-from the neck down . " // He was only partly right . No question , there 's unmistakable activity from the neck down in the teenage years . No question , testosterone is there skateboarding down the railings ; estrogen is throwing her hips around . // But that 's not the whole story . // For the first time now , scientists are starting to look beyond hormones to explain teenage behavior . And they 're finding clues in an unexpected place : the teenage brain , the boiled , besmirched-and decidedly above the neck-teenage brain . // For years it was thought that the teenage brain was finished , cooked . Most of the truly important human brain development , scientists believed , was over by the first three years of life . Explaining teenagers has been the job of social scientists , psychologists , psychiatrists , educators , and maybe a priest or two , not neuroscientists . What possible interest could still lurk behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it turns out , a whole lot . // In unprecedented work , scientists are discovering exactly how the teenage brain works . Using powerful new brain-scanning machines , peering for the first time into living , working teenage brains , coordinating work across countries and across continents , drawing on pioneering work with adolescent primates and even rats , the neuroscientists are finding that the teenage brain , far from being an innocent bystander to hormonal hijinks , is undergoing a dramatic transformation . // The teenage brain , it 's now becoming clear , is still very much a work in progress , a giant construction project . Millions of connections are being hooked up ; millions more are swept away . Neurochemicals wash over the teenage brain , giving it a new paint job , a new look , a new chance at life . The teenage brain is raw , vulnerable . It 's a brain that 's still becoming what it will be . // " We used to think that , if there were brain changes at all in adolescence , they were subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the country 's top researchers of the adolescent brain , told me . " Now we know that those changes are not as subtle as we thought . Every time we look at another set of teenage brains , we find something new . " // And this growing group of neuroscientists-in some cases with teenagers of their own they need to figure out-are uncovering clues that can help us all understand why teenagers do what they do , zeroing in on what the normal , average teenage brain might be up to during what one normal , average seventeen-year-old-girl described as her " brief insanity . " // The portrait is far from one-dimensional . // The teenage brain may , in fact , be briefly insane . But , scientists say , it is crazy by design . The teenage brain is in flux , maddening and muddled . And that 's how it 's supposed to be . // And the teenage brain is also wondrous . It 's the brains of teenagers , after all , that begin to grapple with our knottiest , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuronal nooks and crannies of their evolving brains , teenagers , for the first time , develop true empathy . They may find themselves , often to their own surprise , happy to stay up until three a.m. to listen to a friend in trouble , worrying about the children in war-torn Afghanistan , or passionately falling in love with the nuances of a poem . // " I love teenagers , " said a mother whose two children had successfully navigated their teenage years . " I like their intelligence and their growing ability to think for themselves , to argue intelligently , and get excited by ideas . I like sharing books with them and I like the way they can show me things , like how to use a Palm Pilot . And I like their sense of style . " // In their own way , the brain scientists , too , have detected this polysided adolescence , a normal brain evolution that includes moments of mayhem as well as growing precision and passion . Inside the teenagers ' brains-smart ones , shy ones , silly ones-they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' own ungainly language , exuberance . // Chapter 2 // The Passion Within // Peering into the Living Brain in Search of Normal // Nora loped through the clinic door , her long brown hair with a wide purple streak flowing behind her . In recent years , Nora Berenstain had survived a move from Sacramento to Washington , D.C. , her parents ' divorce , and a horrific seventh grade when her best friend moved away . // Now sixteen , Nora was confident and instantly likable . She volunteered at NOW headquarters and helped edit the school paper . Wearing faded jeans and a flowered shirt , she flopped her tall , thin body down on a chair and burst out : " How ya doin ' , Dr. Giedd ? " // David and Matthew Goldstein , thirteen-year-old twins , came next , bounding in like matching soccer balls . It was their first time at the clinic and they blurted nervous questions . " This machine , what exactly is it going to do , Dr. Giedd ? " asked Matthew . // Dr. Jay Giedd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIH ) who they 'd come to see , is one of a small group of scientists who have recently discovered that the brains of regular , average teenagers like Nora and David and Matthew are far different from what anyone had imagined . // A child psychiatrist , a neuroscientist , and the father of four young kids himself , Giedd is originally from North Dakota . He has an open , round face , a short red beard , and he grinned broadly as each teenager arrived at his clinic trying , with one of his corny North Dakota jokes , to get them to laugh . " Oh , I love your hair , " he told Nora when he saw her purple streak . He patted his own balding head . " I wish I had enough to do that . " // Tuesdays are brain-scanning nights at the National Institutes of Health . Giedd , one of the country 's top brain scanners , had come to the basement room of Building 10 on the NIH campus , as he had every Tuesday from five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trying to understand the normal teenager . // Teenagers usually come to the big brick buildings of the National Institutes of Health because they 're sick . On the third floor of Building 10 , there are beds filled with glassy-eyed children diagnosed with schizophrenia . But the teenagers who come down the long , white corridors to the basement room of Building 10 on Tuesday nights are not sick . Purpled-haired and baggy-panted , they 're as normal and ordinary and healthy as possible . Volunteered by parents , lured by the $60 per visit they 're paid , they arrive and , in the name of science , stick their heads into a big , noisy MRI brain-scanning machine . // Giedd has been putting kids ' heads in this machine for ten years , scanning and rescanning the brains of hundreds of children and teenagers . //
