<p> Everything old is new again , so the saying goes . A character named Batwoman crashes through a window of an abandoned building , making her debut in 52 : Week Eleven ( DC Comics , $2.50 ) , on sale today . <p> With her bright red lipstick , high-heeled boots , long flowing red hair framing a black bat cowl and body covered in Lycra that shows off every voluptuous curve , she is a force to be reckoned with . <p> Though her alter ego Kate Kane made her debut in 52 several weeks ago , this new issue marks the arrival of an updated Batwoman , who garnered headlines earlier this year when DC Comics revealed she would be a lesbian . <p> With 41 issues left in the weekly 52 series , Week Eleven leaves plenty of questions about Batwoman unanswered . She is n't even the sole focus of the series , but rather one plot in a book that has multiple threads . <p> Neither Kate Kane nor Batwoman ever acknowledges her sexuality , but there are certainly enough clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know in a thought balloon that she once was in love with Kane . <p> - Kane seems jealous of Montoya 's new partner ( the Question , who introduces himself as Charlie , her partner ) . <p> - Montoya also seems jealous of the short-haired blond woman sitting in the passenger seat of Kane 's convertible . <p> - Kane tells Montoya the woman in the car is a doctor named Mallory and " you do n't know her . " <p> - Montoya acknowledges in a private thought that Kane 's new girlfriend should n't bother her , but it does . <p> - When Montoya refuses to tell Kane why a building owned by the Kane family is under surveillance , Kane tells her , " You do n't come back into my life after 10 years asking for favors without an explanation , Renee ! " <p> - Afterward , the Question sarcastically tells Montoya she handled the situation well , and it 's no wonder women are falling all over themselves to be with her . <p> - Montoya tells the Question that any feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . <p> In a previous issue , Montoya referred to Kate Kane as " Katherine the young , " opening up the possibility that the new Batwoman is actually the daughter of the original Batwoman , who made her debut in the ' 50s . <p> Of course , that idea does n't make a lot of sense when you look at the original Batwoman , who made her first appearance in 1956 . That character carried a purse of gadgets ( as opposed to the current Batwoman 's far more practical utility belt ) . She seemed more interested in snuggling with Batman than solving crimes and was even partnered with the original BatGirl , her niece Betty Kane ( who was more interested in getting Batman 's teen sidekick Robin to notice her ) . <p> How can one of Batman 's former love interests have a grown daughter when Batman himself still appears to be in his 30s or early 40s ? <p> What a difference decades make <p> Granted , few readers remember the 1950s Batman . Those who do would have a hard time these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one part hard-boiled film noir detective , one part kung fu vigilante . <p> The modern age Batwoman is equally unrecognizable from her Silver Age of Comics counterpart . Kate Kane is a wealthy socialite whose fortune rivals that of billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne ( the Kane family owns the half of Gotham City that 's not owned by Wayne ) . By night , romance is the furthest thing from Batwoman 's mind . <p> One thing that has n't changed from that era is politicians using popular culture as a scapegoat for societal ills . While today 's politicians rail about the ills of video games , Eisenhower-era congressmen denigrated comic books . <p> They were helped in their efforts by Fredric Wertham and his book Seduction of the Innocent , which was published in 1954 . Wertham asserted that comic books were leading the nation 's children down a path of drug use , sex and violence . <p> WAYNE , GRAYSON CRITICIZED <p> He was particularly damning of Batman , describing the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson as " a wish-dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories there are practically no decent , attractive , successful women , " Wertham argued in his book . " A typical female character is the Catwoman , who is vicious and uses a whip . The atmosphere is homosexual and anti-feminine . If the girl is good-looking , she is undoubtedly the villainess . " <p> Fearing government censorship , the comic book industry adopted a rigid policy of self-censorship called the Comics Code Authority in 1954 . <p> Though DC Comics has continually denied it , the reason Batwoman emerged in 1956 was to squash claims of Batman 's homosexuality . Kathy Kane became what is referred to within the gay community as " a beard "  --  a woman a gay man dates to give the appearance that he is straight . <p> On the surface , making the new Batwoman a lesbian when the old Batwoman was an obscure character without much of a fan base and with few actual appearances amounts to a safe move for company executives . It 's a move they could never have gotten away with had they used a better-known female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move simply because of the backstory that led to the creation of the previous Batwoman . Batman 's " beard " has come out as a lesbian . Can a rainbow flag sticker on the bumper of the Batmobile be far behind ? <p> Will the gay line work ? <p> Is a gay Batwoman enough to hook readers ? The issue does leave you wanting to know more . What would prompt a socialite to don a cowl and Lycra suit and risk her life to fight crime ? What caused the breakup between Montoya and Kane , and is a happy ending in their future ? Will Batman feel threatened by an equally powerful defender of justice ? Will they work collectively or establish shifts ? <p> Public reaction to the character ( read : your ability to stick with the character beyond her sensationalized debut ) will likely decide whether DC grants her continued crime-fighting adventures beyond the series . <p> But based on her action-packed debut , she 's an engaging character worthy of her own title . <p> mdavenport@suntimes.com <p> COMIC BOOK REVIEW <p> 52 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sale today <p> WORLD OF SUPERHEROES MAKES ROOM FOR ALL INCLINATIONS <p> Batwoman is just one in a growing league of gay characters . Here ( with some help from www.gayleague.com ) are a few of our favorite openly gay heroes and villains , as well as a few we ca n't help but wonder about : <p> GAY <p> NORTHSTAR <p> ( Various X-Men titles from Marvel ) <p> The first openly gay superhero ( and perhaps the best known because of it ) , Northstar ( plain-clothes identity : Jean-Paul Beaubier ) is able to achieve super-human speeds . Super speed has n't helped him in the romance department , though . Still single , he was briefly infatuated with fellow X-Man Bobby Drake ( a k a Iceman ) , who is straight . <p> PIED PIPER <p> ( THE FLASH , DC ) <p> Born deaf into a wealthy family that spent millions to restore his hearing , Harley Rathaway was obsessed with music and sound , eventually creating weapons that utilized both . A constant foe to the second Flash ( Barry Allen ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of crime . Currently living with his boyfriend James , Rathaway is a champion of both gay rights and the homeless . <p> OBSIDIAN <p> ( MANHUNTER , DC ) <p> The son of the original Green Lantern , Todd Rice was separated from his twin sister and raised by foster parents in Milwaukee . His superpowers ( he can become a living shadow ) emerged during his teen years . He subsequently was reunited with his sister ( who took the superhero name of Jade ) , turned evil for a bit , lost his powers and found love . Rice 's boyfriend , a lawyer , seems to have a thing for superheroes . He once asked out Hawkman , who is straight , and who declined . <p> LESBIAN <p> Sailor Neptune , Sailor Uranus ( Sailor Moon , Kodansha ) <p> In the pages of the Japanese manga , Neptune and Uranus battle injustice and share a loving relationship . Do n't look for an exploration of it in the animated series " Sailor Moon , " though . The show was sanitized when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . <p> BISEXUAL <p> JOHN CONSTANTINE <p> ( HELLBLAZER , VERTIGO ) <p> The long-running series has mentioned exes of both sexes for the anti-hero , a chain-smoking dabbler in the dark arts . In issues 170-174 , John even seduced a man as part of a con . In the big-budget film adaptation " Constantine , " Keanu Reeves played the character ( pardon the pun ) straight . <p> ON THE FENCE <p> JIMMY OLSEN <p> ( VARIOUS SUPERMAN TITLES , DC ) <p> Though he occasionally has a girlfriend , there 's just something about Superman 's pal that makes us think he 's a bit light in the loafers . Perhaps it 's the way he seems to hang on Clark Kent 's every word or his obsession with the big guy in blue tights . Not even Lois Lane has been saved as often as Jimmy . And Superman even gave Jimmy a watch so Jimmy can contact him anytime . Hmmm . <p> HAWK AND DOVE <p> ( DECEASED ; DC COMICS ) <p> Yes , the original Hawk and Dove were actually brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight more like a married couple than siblings . That 's all we 're saying . <p> BATMAN AND ROBIN <p> ( CIRCA 1940-1956 , DC ) <p> We 're with Seduction of the Innocent author Fredric Wertham on this one . The relationship between Bruce Wayne ( Batman ) and his ward Dick Grayson ( Robin ) is just weird enough that if the pair existed in the real world , we 'd have no qualms about calling child protective services .

His boyfriend , a lawyer , seems to like superheroes . He once was interested in Hawkman , who 's straight. ; Color Photo : Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus share a relationship in the Japanese manga , but not in the sanitized animated series. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as brothers , but we think they fight more like a married couple than like siblings .
