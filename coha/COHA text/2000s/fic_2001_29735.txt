Vince I was making love to En Vogue . Not the group , but one majestic woman in a royal blue negligee . She had Cindy 's intelligent smile , Maxine 's sexy disposition , Terri 's womanly grace . Her negligee slipped off her shoulders , slid down across her breasts . Inside her moan , she sang my name . Inched me toward her warm soul . Dana hummed with the feeling . " You love me , Vince ? " Okay , I was about to tell you my name , but I guess Dana beat me to the punch . Vincent Calvary Browne Jr . And the woman I was holding , the one who had my face flushed , toes curling while I sang her name , the angel who was squirming ever so slowly in pleasure , that was my woman . The one I wanted to have forever . The last one I ever wanted to make love to . I 'm almost thirty and do n't have a lot of family . Not now anyway . Not since my divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colon cancer and it spread up . That was when I was nineteen . Pops had it in his throat and it spread down . That was right after I made sixteen . Moms did n't have me until she was almost forty ; Pops was in his fifties . So I guess I came from an old egg and some old sperm . That 's why people always tell me I have an old soul . People have always said that I acted and sounded ten years older than I was . A baritone voice makes anybody sound older . But I 've always felt ten years younger . Mistakes make a man feel like that . Hard living and bad loving ages a man . Divorce ranks right up there with death , so I 've lost more in a few years than most men lose in a lifetime . The biggest loss was when my ex-wife had an affair , divorced me , then vanished with my little girl . I met Dana a few months back , up at the Townhouse . That 's a soul food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black middle-class part of Los Angeles not too far from LAX . That night Jaguars , Rolls-Royces , and Benzs were corralled at the east end of the strip mall , dark-haired Mexicans doing the valet parking . The club had a live band up front , playing sassy , Marlena Shaw-style jazz . An unknown all-girl hip-hop group , Dangerous Lyrics , was supposed to hit the small stage in the back room a little later . In the meantime , a D.J . was keeping the flow going in the rear . A few sisters were under thirty , maybe under twenty-five , most showing as much flesh as legal . And a few were the victims of gravity and time : old babes in young dresses . This was where the generation gap collided over jazz and drinks . A few brothers had some age on them too ; older-than-dirt players who were strutting around , Poli-Grip on their breath , acting like they knew they were still the shit . If this was a meat market , some of this beef needed an expiration date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brokenhearted . I know because I was one of them . Hell , I was both of them . Right before Dana drifted into the room , I was kinda leery about trying to start a conversation , because I 'd just gotten a rejection slip from one sister . Earlier that night I 'd met this long-legged creature with stilettos and a slinky dress . She 'd come to me while I lingered at the bar in the back room . Said she worked at UPS , been there ten years . Her Bugs Bunny overbite said that she had n't taken advantage of her dental plan , but the more I drank , the less that was a problem for me . She was perky and had personality . Stood out from the women who were clinging to dirty old men twice their daddy 's ages . She made at least twenty duckets an hour , bragged about her 500-series BMW , even showed me a Polaroid of her new ride , but was crying broke because of the twelve-dollar cover charge . We danced on the itty-bitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then hung out close to the fireplace and had a damn good time for the left side of thirty minutes . Bought her two glasses of wine while we laughed about this and that . Her eyes were all over my dark suit and off-white linen shirt , flirting strong , and my mack was on target , more persuasive than Johnny Cochran 's closing argument . Then she asked me , " So , brotherman , are you married ? " I told her , " Divorced . You ? " " Single . " All of her youthful features started to sag , like air being let out of a balloon . " So , you have kids ? " I sipped my chardonnay . " A daughter . I have a daughter . " Midnight-colored clouds came from nowhere and darkened her brown eyes . Her shoulders slumped and she let out a sigh . Real quick , she gulped down the last of her wine , lost the pep in her voice , said , " Well , it was nice to meet you , Reggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Vincent Browne . " " My head is hurting . I 'm going home . " I asked , " Well , can I get your number ? " " Ahhhh ... give me yours . " I did . My eyes were on the back of her head as she headed up the hallway , passed by the pictures of Billie Holiday and Malcolm X , kept moving by the exit sign , made a right , and vanished . Minutes later she was up front at the octagonal-shaped bar , on a new yellow brick road , jazzing it up , in another man 's wallet , a brother older than Grady from Sanford and Son . That was n't the first time I 'd gone through rejection . It was n't always about the marriage thing ; sometimes it was about income , even went on a date with a sister and she saw I was n't rolling around in a new hoopty , the kind of ride she wanted to be seen cruising Pacific Coast Highway in . Nope , rejection ai n't nothing new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fridays . At the L.A. Social Club on First Saturdays . At the Los Angeles County Museum during a cultured happy hour . Happened at church on communion Sunday . On-line in AOL , sisters were either looking for an Adonis or a brother with a mega bankroll . Always looking for love in all the wrong faces . So that 's where my head was at : frustrated and pissed off . I 'd wasted an hour of my life , and because of the cover charge and the drinks my pockets were thirty dollars thinner . I was about to say three tears in a bucket and give it up ; going to a club searching for a quality woman was like going to Target and hunting for Saks Fifth Avenue merchandise-ai n't gon na happen . Then I made eye contact with Dana . Rapturous midnight skin in a golden business suit . White pearls . Hair in thin , spaghetti-style braids , the kind that were loose on the ends and could be curled or put in pretty much any style . Classic , conservative , fashionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraved in stone from the heart of the motherland . A few brothers with their momma 's breast milk still on their breath put down their cellular phones , craned their necks , and peeped . A number of the rusty players with Geritol dripping out of the corners of their mouths rubbed their receding hairlines and checked her out , head to toe . She eased into the room , her tight eyes my way . She smiled . I smiled . A smile is the shortest distance between two people . The musician Victor Borge said that . One-thousand-one , one-thousand-two- I counted how long she held my gaze . By one-thousand-five , Dana 's superior gravitational pull had me bumping through the crowd , heading her way , adrenaline rushing . By the time I made it to her zone , she stopped dancing in place . Her arms folded across her breasts . She shifted like she did n't want to be bothered . I would 've let it go , but her eyes . Tight light brown eyes that hypnotized me . Her eyes , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't walk away , not without a try . I gave her another easygoing smile . Introduced myself . Dana Smith did the same . We shook hands . Her hands were soft , fingers thin , but she had a good grip . Very business , very questioning , that signal established a thick line . As far as I could tell , she 'd come in alone . Before I got cozy she said , " I 'm meeting somebody up here . " East Coast . I recognized that metropolitan accent , flair , picked up on the bright lights , big city tone in her words . That with her straight back and straightforward posture , her urbane style , made her so different from the rest . Made her mysterious , exotic , and fascinating in my eyes . She was n't a born and raised L.A. woman . I did n't know if that was good or bad . Based on my track record with West Coast women , it had to be good . I said , " Place is pretty crowded . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a she . Geraldine " - she caught herself- " I mean Gerri Greene . We work in the same real estate office . " Nervousness ran through my blood , a fresh heat dried my throat . Her buddy 's name sounded too damn familiar . I wondered if her friend knew my ex-wife , or me , for that matter . I asked , " She married ? " " Divorced . " Dana checked her watch . " She should 've come by now . I should page her before she gets here and wastes twelve bucks . " " Uh-oh . What 's wrong ? " Dana looked at the clientele , frowned . " No curb appeal . " " Curb appeal ? " " Do n't look good from the outside . Real estate talk . " " Gotcha . " " Somebody call George Lucas , this looks like a Chewbacca convention . " I laughed . She went on with her ranking : " And that sister over there needs to quit getting dressed in the dark . She has on more colors than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cellulite a fun house mirror . " Comical . Intelligent , thick , bedroom voice that made a brother wonder what she sounded like when she whispered sweet things . Perfume dabbed behind her ears , in the crevice of her breasts . Long black braids pulled away from her face , clipped in place . Nails clear , not overdone with a million colors . One small diamond in each ear . Classic , classy , smooth . And she had a job . She gets bonus points for being gainfully employed . I wanted to know , " How did you end up in real estate ? " " I have an older cousin , Dawn , who was out here doing real estate . Did it for about ten years . Hubby dumped her for a singer . Dawn moved back to New York after she divorced , but always talked about how great the market was out here . Guess I wanted to pick up where she left off . " A waitress dressed in fake black leather , a purple wig , and a top that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a tray of shots : " Would you like to try a Crown Royal tonight ? " I shook my head and asked Dana if she wanted a drink , my treat . She wanted a 7UP . I took out my wallet , invested four dollars in my future . We moved over by the light blue rails and white walls , watched people who had denied their last ten birthdays struggle with a Lauryn Hill groove , and fell into the typical conversation people have when they 're sizing each other up : the age , what do you do to make your ends meet , where you from thing . Told her I was twenty-eight , born July 17 , in Pasadena . In between singing along , Dana said she was born at Mount Sinai , June 14 , twenty-seven years ago , had packed up and come out here by herself . I 'm a moody Cancer and she 's an unpredictable Gemini . Fire and dynamite . A dangerous combination in any season . Mid-sentence , she stopped and motioned . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who had on dark linen pants , white blouse . A small waist , everything the right size , in the right places . Cinnamon skin , round face , freckles , light brown hair in a bob . I saw all of that while Dana 's buddy made her way through a crowd of ancient brothers who hovered over her like vultures on a prairie . Four men tried to stop her stroll ; four men were ignored . Dana and Gerri hugged , short and intense . I expected them to start talking in that silly , high tone that women use when they 're trying to act like girls , but they did n't . Their voices stayed smooth , even . I stayed in the background , tapped my feet to the hip-hop , and played it cool . Gerri frowned . " Dag . This place is usually popping . " Dana introduced us . Her buddy had a faint southern accent , added down-home sensuality to her strong presence . Gerri had a young face with a mature demeanor . That had to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out was the weariness underneath her eyes . To me it looked like she 'd had a busy life . No dirt was underneath her fingernails , but hard workers recognize hard workers . Dana asked , " What took so long ? Had me waiting . " " Shit . " Gerri took a deep breath . " Today has been hell on wheels . Had to drop my kids off at my ex-in-laws-that 's where my ex is going to pick them up . His weekend with the crew , so I 'm free from parental servitude for forty-eight hours . Anyway , my son did n't want to go . He met this girl . " " Oh boy . " " That 's why I want him gone , gone , gone . I ai n't trying to be nobody 's grandmomma . Anyhow , to top that off , my daughter was n't feeling good , so I had to stop and buy her some of that nighttime , sniffling , sneezing , coughing , aching , stuffy head , fever so I can rest medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NyQuil ? " " Then I ended up getting there the same time Melvin did , and we had a few financial things to talk about . We almost got into a shouting match , but you know I did n't want to show out in front of my kids . " " You tell him things have been a little rough ? " She nodded . " And I let him know that I 'm tired of being patient and I 'm talking to an attorney . A Jewish attorney at that . I do n't want the white man all up in my biz , but like my momma used to say , when a nigga do n't do right , call Mr. White . " " You 're taking him back to court ? " " I do n't want to . But a sister got ta do what a sister got ta do . " Gerri tsked . " So , I 'm going to have to keep working my other paper route twice a week . That extra cabbage is really making a difference . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with two kids and an ex-husband , a profile that was damn close to mine . For a few seconds I wished that Gerri had sashayed in the room first . Empathy would live in her corner . Maybe . But then again , maybe her plate was already too full . A tall brother peacocked his way across the room , tapped her on the shoulder , then leaned in and smiled like he was auditioning for a Colgate commercial . He said , " Mind if I talk to you for a minute ? " " Do I know you ? " was Gerri 's stiff reply . " Not yet . " He had a reddish complexion , built like a solid oak tree , goatee trimmed , hair short and texturized to make it look curly , dressed head to toe in Tommy Hilfiger jeans , shoes , probably had on matching Hilfiger drawers . The walking billboard had jumped right into the flow of our verbal intercourse , burglarized his way into our conversation . His name was Jefferson . He was the proud manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit the stage in the back . He bragged , told Gerri how the group had just got back from Atlanta . They 'd won a talent show for HOT 97 , had a big after party at someplace called Plush . Chris Tucker . Holyfield . Chilli . Miki Howard . In the middle of his flattery and nonstop macking he dropped a lot of names . Gerri asked him , " Ai n't you kinda young to be playing me so close ? " " I ai n't young . I 'm twenty-six . " " Well , this chunk of Little Rock is thirty-six . " " Damn , you do n't look no more than twenty-one . " " Thanks , but look . Let 's not waste time . I 'm divorced with two kids . My daughter is in middle school . My son is sixteen , almost your age . What you wan na do , come over and play Nintendo with him while you baby-sit ? " " Hey , age ai n't nothing but a number . " " In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five minutes , that 's all I ask . Let me buy you a drink and we can talk , and in the end if you wan na step off , cool . " He did n't back away . Stood in front of her like he had been appointed the spring to her summer . Six foot five , thick , and when he strutted , most of the sisters looked like they were ready to start throwing him their panties and keys to hotel rooms and charge cards . Jefferson took Gerri 's hand , pulled her away from us , got her a glass of wine , hemmed up in a private spot , and got his mack on . When they left Dana smiled , looked the young buck up and down , let her eyes dance to a rhythm of envy and delight , then made a sexy , humming sound . I asked , " What was that all about ? " " What ? " I mimicked her scandal-lust humming . She laughed . " You were n't supposed to hear that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smooth French Connections , I played the role and hid from my memories , told Dana I was a black man working hard every day , as single as a dollar bill , no kids , no ex-wives , no problems . With every word I dug my hole deeper . Dana shifted closer , gave me serious eyes , said she had the same resume . Dangerous Lyrics took the stage . A group of five girls . Most of them barely looked legal . All dressed in tight-tight black pants made of that trendy , stretchy-tight material that let you know where a woman 's panty lines are . Colorful halter tops-satin lying across their majestic breasts-made them look like rainbows above the waist . All of them with nicknames like Big Leggs , Goldie , Butter Pecan , Pooh Bear , Chocolate Starr . Butter Pecan stepped up like she was the leader of the crew . From her looks , her nickname was based on her complexion . The D.J . kicked on a preprogrammed tape . People stepped back and the group found some space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ferocious energy M.C. Hammer did when he had a job , sounded like TLC with a NWA edge and did an edgy song of possessiveness of a lover . They set the room on fire with a catchy melody that praised sex , retribution , violence , pretty much everything wrapped in one tune . Gerri was on wearing out the carpet , hands up high , pumping it up and grooving . At thirty-six she danced better , had more choreography than most of the girls in the rap group . Dana smiled , bebopped where she stood , shoulders bouncing to the beat . I spoke up over the music , asked her , " Wan na dance ? " " About time . I was wondering when you were gon na ask me . " She took my hand , anxiously led me through the heat . We had to settle for the carpet ; the floor was only big enough for about ten people . It was awkward because the carpet was worn , held stains that made the fabric sticky to my shoes . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the carpet , turned up the volume on her rhythm , moved so good that other men tried to sneak a peek and women tried to mock her style . After Dangerous Lyrics finished two records , the room applauded loud enough for the girls to O.D. on their egos , then the group went to another room . Gerri and Jefferson were between the fireplace and the exit sign in the back , slow dancing , laughing , talking nonstop , her southern grin gazing up at that roan-colored statue with dreamy eyes . Dana turned down my offer to slow dance , did n't let me get that close . The music changed . Then Gerri vanished with the spring to her summer . Dana said , " Got ta go potty . " " I 'll be right here . " I headed for the narrow hallway between the front of the club and the back , where the loud music from the front collided with the loud music in the back , canceling each other out . The girls from the group came out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back tears with every pissed-off word : " I do n't believe that fucker brought us down here , then was all over that old-ass bitch , dumped me like I ai n't shit . " " Why you tripping , Butter ? He ai n't your man . He set your ass straight down in Atlanta . Stop playing up on him and quit tripping . " " I ai n't trippin ' . He the one trippin ' . " " Well , you need to think about the group . Like he told you , this is business . That other stuff you running off at the mouth about ain't- " They felt me listening . Ten eyes snapped my way at the same time . Butter stepped out , gave me a cold **28;514;TOOLONG expression before she stormed away . Her girls followed their leader . As soon as Dana came out of the bathroom , she said she was ready to raise up out of here , so I escorted her out to her car . We talked and headed beyond the Brenda 's Talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the far side of Ralph 's grocery store . Dana stopped in front of a dark-colored Infiniti Q45 . Her ride was ten years old . She looked disturbed . " Full moon . " " Full moons means romantic . " She shook her head , her mood changing , becoming dark and distant . " Drama . A full moon is a flashlight so everybody can see your drama . " I opened her door , peeped inside before I let her get in . No child seat , no sign of those cheap throwaway toys that come inside a Happy Meal . No man 's belongings . No leftover cologne scent . Dana kept the door between us , that subtle yet straightforward move a woman does when she 's letting a man know that she ai n't in it for the kissing . Her lips , full and dark with color . All evening , every time they opened and closed , my mouth watered . She tossed her purse over to the passenger seat ; it turned over and some of the woman stuff she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Checkbook . A coal black stun gun . That caught my eye . She followed my eyes to the stun gun and said , " I was mugged on the subway . " " Mugged ? " " Got jacked for my little old purse . Damn near fell in front of a freakin ' subway train and got run over . " She cleared her throat like she was trying to cough the memory out of her system , then picked up her urban assault weapon , let it rest in her lap , in ready position . " I was almost run over by a train , but this guy caught me before I fell . " " Good thing he caught you . " Her tone turned flat . " Good thing , yeah . Bad thing too . " She fired up the engine ; it purred like a newborn kitten . She took my digits , gave me her red-white-blue business card . Her office was near the golf courses in white-bred Westchester . The card had her smiling face on the front , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address , but she did n't give up the home number . That made me question whether she really lived alone . Or was single . I 've been on a few dates with sisters , and when we made it back to their crib , a boyfriend or a husband that they 'd forgotten all about was waiting in the parking lot . Not a good way to end a night . It 's all part of that dating game . You lie about this , I lie about that , you do n't tell me this , I do n't tell you that , we date a while , have sex , some lies come out , we mention the unmentioned , we realize how incompatible we are after about six months of fun in the sun , then bygones . I offered , " Wan na hit Roscoe 's for some chicken , maybe coffee ? " " My girlfriend in New York said Roscoe 's stole the idea from Well 's Chicken and Waffles on Seventh Avenue in Harlem . " " Never heard that . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roscoe stole everything but the recipe . " " Is that fact or fiction ? " " Well , my fact is this : I support my people back in Harlem . " She gave me a firm good-bye handshake , then drove away . Three tears in a bucket , motherfuck it . I headed three parking spaces over to my old 300ZX . A ride that needed a set of new tires and new fuel injectors . With the layoffs , I 'd been cutting corners . Aerospace had been as steady as a two-legged table during an earthquake . When I came down a moment ago , I had n't looked out across the lot , had been too focused on the woman from New York . Her friend , Gerri , was standing between an Eddie Bauer and a Range Rover , under the full moon , living in the broken shadows with Jefferson . His arms were wrapped around her like he was her protector . They were kissing and I heard their sound . Moans and groans that come from hardness and wetness . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like high school kids . I watched them until heat warmed my groin and envy burned in my lungs . Yep , once again I 'd wasted half the night and too much money on the wrong woman . I tossed Dana 's ReMax business card facedown on the black pavement . I knew that I'll-call-ya routine . During my three-mile drive , I passed by bus benches . Saw Gerri 's photo plastered on a few . Felt relief . That was why her name and her face were familiar . It had nothing to do with my ex-wife , nothing to do with my past .
