<p> Shakespeare had it wrong . <p> Parting is n't such sweet sorrow  --  especially when it comes by e-mail . <p> Today 's pink slip is delivered many different ways : RadioShack recently used e-mail to alert workers they were being let go . Northwest Airlines , in a bid to be helpful , suggested its laid-off workers go Dumpster diving to make ends meet . <p> On Friday , financially ailing Ford Motor Co. said it was offering buyouts  --  a somewhat sweeter way to say goodbye  --  to its 75,000 U.S. hourly workers . <p> In Georgia , the number of mass layoffs  --  those involving 50 or more workers  --  is up 2.6 percent this year . " That 's in contrast with the U.S. , which is showing a downward trend , " said John Lawrence , director of Workforce Information and Analysis at the Georgia Department of Labor . <p> For those of us who are n't independently wealthy or running our own businesses , it 's high season for job cuts . <p> Statistically speaking , the downsizing danger zone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . That 's when many companies do the bulk of their layoffs , according to Challenger , Gray &; Christmas , a Chicago area outplacement firm . <p> " This is the time of year when everybody 's settled back into work and when companies feel they have one last-ditch effort to trim whatever costs , " says David V. Lorenzo , partner with the Gallup Organization in its consulting practice . " Quite honestly , they 're evaluating what they can do to reduce costs , particularly if they did n't make their revenue numbers . " <p> Ford 's Friday announcement is a prime example . The automaker , which lost $1.4 billion in the first half of the year , said it will cut an additional 10,000 salaried jobs and close plants , all in an effort to stem losses . <p> The additional cuts at Ford bring the number of announced job cuts in the auto industry to almost 90,000 this year , according to Challenger 's count . <p> " It is becoming more likely that the auto sector will surpass last year 's annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payroll accounts for a company 's biggest  --  and often easiest-to-cut  --  expense , experts say . Also , September and October typically are some of the most difficult months for the stock market , Lorenzo said , as " investors decide which stock they 'll hold onto and which one they 'll liquidate . " <p> As cold as it sounds , " Wall Street views layoffs as a good thing , " he said . <p> " Companies will lay off employees to signal they 're trying , " Lorenzo said . " All that does n't take into account the human toll . " <p> Recent cuts <p> Year-end layoffs have gotten off to an early and somewhat nasty start in the past month . Announced job cuts were up 76 percent in August , after hitting a six-year low in July . <p> * RadioShack told 400 workers via e-mail that they were being fired . <p> * Northwest Airlines handed 60 ground operations workers walking papers along with two pages of money-saving tips that included this suggestion : Do n't be afraid to peruse thrift stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently dismissed his " Apprentice " sidekick , Carolyn Kepcher . <p> " Layoffs are always a dirty business , " said John Challenger of Challenger , Gray &; Christmas , who has spent his career helping laid-off workers find jobs . " There 's no good way or easy way to deal with it . There 's always mistakes made . There 's always companies who are too callous . The new technology gets misused . " <p> Process ' misunderstood ' <p> RadioShack , hoping to stem the backlash , called John Challenger . <p> " It 's the only time I 've gotten a call from a company trying to explain that they felt misunderstood , " he said . <p> Talk of the e-firings is still a sore point with RadioShack . The company blames " inaccurate reporting " by the media for blowing the situation out of proportion . <p> " Yes , e-mail was part of the process , " said Wendy Dominguez , a spokeswoman for RadioShack Corp . in Fort Worth , Texas . " But the e-mail that was sent was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate supervisor . People were aware they were going to get an e-mail about the process . " <p> Northwest Airlines concedes its attempts to be helpful did n't turn out too well . <p> " Some of the tips were n't appropriate , " said Northwest spokesman Roman Blahoski . " And once the company realized that , they were immediately removed from the handbook . We responded in a matter of days . The company apologized , and the CEO issued an apology . " <p> Whether the dismissal comes electronically , orally or in print , this much is clear : the 30-year-gold-watch work path is over . <p> " My father worked for 33 years for one company , " said Charlie Brock , president and chief operating officer for Executrack , an Atlanta-based outplacement , leadership development and executive coaching firm . " I worked 30 years for four companies . It 's not unusual for the next generation coming up to work four jobs in three years . " <p> Cuts could yield trouble <p> Aside from the emotional toll , letting people go is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maryland puts a long-held corporate practice in question . A Lockheed Martin employee targeted for layoff sued the company after she refused to sign a release . The company withheld her severance . <p> " Demanding she give up her right to sue is tantamount to retaliation , " said David Hagaman , a partner with the law firm Ford &; Harrison in Atlanta . The ruling has prompted Hagaman to caution clients against similar action . <p> Hagaman has helped companies through the delicate decisions of downsizing . He has gone to clients ' offices , pulled out lists and gone " name by name , " helping clients follow proper procedures . <p> He 's also talked companies out of laying off people , persuading them instead to consider shorter workdays or workweeks or transfers . <p> " My advice to clients : Are there other ways to avoid a layoff ? Because good people are hard to find , " Hagaman said . <p> The work environment has been significantly transformed because of worldwide competition . Continual training will keep many workers from the corporate chopping block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not jobs  --  five times , said Michael Thurmond , commissioner of Georgia 's Labor Department . <p> " Workers have to take their careers and their fates in their own hands , " he said . <p> A WORKER 'S GUIDE TO THE WORLD OF PINK SLIPS <p> Corporate pencil-counting . Travel cutbacks . The boss avoids you at every turn . Here are more clues that your company  --  or job  --  may be circling the drain : <p> SIGNS YOUR JOB MAY BE TOAST <p> * Your boss avoids talking to you and distances himself from you . <p> * You 're not invited to key meetings anymore . You 're out of the loop . <p> * You start seeing people leave or being let go . Job cuts are all around you . <p> * You 're refused a bunch of promotions or you do n't get plum assignments anymore . <p> WHO 'S MOST VULNERABLE <p> Airline workers , autoworkers , the recently hired , veteran workers who are viewed as deadwood , underperformers , workers who do n't directly affect the bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day and the end of the year . Roughly 38 percent of the 9.65 million job cuts announced between 1996 and 2005 occurred after Labor Day . <p> WHERE YOU 'RE MOST VULNERABLE <p> The West and Southwest saw the biggest job cuts in August , with California reporting more than 27,500 job cuts . <p> WHERE YOU 'RE SAFEST <p> Vermont , which reported a total of six job cuts in August . <p> Source : Challenger , Gray &; Christmas , career consultant Nancy Collamer and David V. Lorenzo , a partner with the Gallup Organization <p> FIRED VS . LAID OFF <p> Canned . Fired . Laid off . It 's all the same , right ? <p> No . Not if you want to stay on the right side of the law , says employment attorney David Hagaman . Here 's the rule of thumb to follow : <p> Terminations or firings generally are based on three factors : attendance , performance or misconduct . <p> Layoffs or downsizings are usually outside of a worker 's control . But employers still need to keep two questions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the layoff ? Even if you meet that test , you 're not in the clear , Hagaman says . The second  --  harder  --  question is why did you pick the people you picked ? <p> " You 'd better have an objective basis for picking the people you pick , " Hagaman says . " It ca n't just be the person has a bad attitude or the person does n't play golf . It has to be some measure of your job , or the layoff may be suspect . If the reason has holes in it , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC will notice , and so will a court or jury . "
