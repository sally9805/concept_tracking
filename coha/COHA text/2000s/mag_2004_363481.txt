Within days after Saddam 's capture , France , Germany and Russia announced their willingness to consider relieving Iraq 's crushing debt burden . This was no burst of conscience about unrepayable billions lent Saddam to squander on grotesque palaces and grotesque weapons . This was the wind shifting America 's way in Iraq  --  and the neutrals adjusting course accordingly . <P> But this is not the beginning of a great reconciliation . These countries were no help before the war , during the war or after the war . France tried to rally the world to stop the U.S. from deposing Saddam . Russia was sending night-vision goggles to Saddam . Not one lifted a finger to help the postwar reconstruction . <P> Some Americans are bitter about this , others merely confused . Democrats think it 's our fault . They charge Bush with mishandling relations with the allies . Theirs is an etymological problem . Events have overtaken vocabulary . These countries are not allies . It is sheer laziness now that counts France and Germany as old allies , sheer naivete that counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise us . Countries have different interests . For a half-century , anticommunism papered over those differences , but communism is gone . Europe lives by Lord Palmerston 's axiom : nations have no permanent allies , only permanent interests . Alliance with America is no longer a permanent interest . The postwar alliance that once structured and indeed defined our world is dead . It died in 2003 . <P> To be sure , there are some countries that see their ultimate security as dependent upon the international order maintained by the U.S. These are not insignificant countries , and over time they may become the kernel of an entirely new alliance system . They include Anglo-Saxons ( Britain , Australia ) and a few Europeans ( Italy , Spain , Poland , other newly liberated East European countries ) . They understand that the sinews of stability  --  free commerce , open sea lanes , regional balances of power , nonproliferation , deterrence  --  are provided overwhelmingly by the American colossus . They understand that without it , the world collapses into chaos and worse . They believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder . <P> As for the rest , they are content to leave America out there twisting in the wind . They do not wish us destroyed  --  they are not crazy  --  but they are not unhappy to see us distracted , diminished and occasionally defeated . <P> When the Iraq war began , the French Foreign Minister refused a reporter 's question as to which side he wanted to win . This was not a mere expression of pique . When the existential enemy was Nazism or communism , the world rallied to the American protector . But Arab-Islamic radicalism is different . Its hatreds are wide , but its strategic focus is America . Its monument is ground zero . Ground zero is not in Paris . <P> The neutrals know that perhaps in the long run they too will be threatened . For now , however , they are quite content to see the U.S. carry the fight against the new barbarians . The U.S. was attacked ; it will carry the fight regardless .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
