In the fifteen months since we last published his work ( " Ultraviolet Night , " March 2004 ) , Jim Young has left D.C. and the State Department for L.A. and the Silver Screen . Some of his recent acting work includes playing a delegate for the Democratic convention in the TV show " The West Wing " and serving as an extra in Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and in The War of the Worlds . ( One wonders how many other extras running from the invading aliens wrote their doctoral dissertations on H. G. Wells . ) His new story is a blend of old and new , recasting pulp elements for the electronic age . <p> THE SPACECRAFT FERMI arrived thirsty . It had been looking for chemicals to drink for more than two hundred years , ever since leaving Earth 's solar system . Its main mission was to investigate the first gravitational pulsar discovered by mankind . Although it had little computing power and could run only a primitive personality substrate , the ship 's artificial intelligence found a planet roughly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of about a light year ; the AI allowed itself a moment to note that it had found what it needed . The planet , shrouded in interstellar darkness and consequently only a few degrees above absolute zero , was frosted with an ocean of frozen water and carbon dioxide and nitrogen , and founded on a core of iron and uranium that could provide cheap power . There the Fermi , all twenty-two kilograms of it , landed and drank deep . It spewed out nanotransformers that absorbed the frozen atmosphere and gnawed downward to mine nickel and iron . And when the Fermi was satisfied that it had enough material to do the job , it began building extensive diamond lattices to expand its own memory so-that its AI could start to function as a personality in its own right . Then it launched a cloud of nanobots to build an orbiting relay antenna capable of transmitting AIs back to Earth and turned to constructing a headquarters structure . Once that was well under way , the Fermi began building two robots designed to complete the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had carried through all the light years from Earth . Mira was the first to awaken . It was a marvelous simulation , she thought drowsily - very much like waking up in the flesh . The Fermi had excavated a shelter in the planet 's surface and filled it with a thin nitrogen atmosphere to provide an environment in which water could be kept as a liquid , just in case the mission had to deal with non-digital life forms . At the same time , the ship had built separate rooms for Mira and for her father 's simulation . Mira decided she rather liked her room . It was n't very big , but it had plasma screen walls so she could decorate it as she saw fit . That made her smile , and she could tell then , for the first time , just how good a simulation it really was . Because she could feel herself smiling . She sat up in bed and studied the shining stainless-steel body the ship had built for her . Not bad looking , she thought . With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a mirror . Her reflection looked like a well-built woman wearing a space suit - not a robot . No doubt about it - her fianc Rein would approve . After all , it was designed to provide the perfect illusion of life . But then the mission designers had thought of everything , including her father . Tibor woke up and heard his daughter humming as she worked . " Good morning , Mira , " he said as he walked out into the common room . Mira was concentrating on something and did n't hear him , He walked toward her and noticed the display of the surface on one of the walls . It depicted a great dome sitting in a narrow valley , with the Milky Way rising above it in the midnight-dark sky . " Mira - what is that ? " he asked , staring at the picture of the dome . She looked up and smiled at him . " Morning , Dad . Look what we found . " There was a hint of laughter in her voice . " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does n't look like anything the ship was supposed to build . " " You 're right , we did n't build it . Just found it . It 's about five klicks away . " Tibor looked at the picture , studying the building 's simple lines . " Well , then . Somebody 's been here before us . " " It sure looks that way . " Tibor sat down on the bench by the work table , clasped his hands together , and chewed on his simulated lip . At length he said , " The planners did n't think we 'd run into anything quite like that . " Mira gazed at the picture . " I 'm going to go and explore it . " Tibor looked anxious . " I do n't think it 's safe to go out on your own . " He saw her face smiling at him in the three-D sim running where a space-suit 's faceplate would be . " Dad , we 've got a rover vehicle , remember ? " He chuckled at himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his personality preferences . " You had me worried for a minute , dear . I thought you wanted to go out there alone . " She shook her head and smiled fondly at him . " Dad - we 've got your evaluation parameters running too far into the elderly-parent realm . Let me adjust that for you . " " Thank you , dear . " Tibor sat before the screen , plugged into the controls for the little halftrack rover . Mira sat near him , checking the Fermi 's orbital antenna array and following the rover 's video feed out of the corner of her eye . As Tibor drove the vehicle over the hills toward the dome , it was quickly apparent that the building had at least a dozen arched entrances at ground level . He tried to drive all the way around it but found his way blocked by a meteorite crater . Looking up , he could see that the dome had taken a hit - its blue surface was pitted and streaked where the meteorite had struck it , bounced off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dome is made out of , it 's awfully strong , " Tibor said , almost as much to himself as to Mira . " Why do n't you run some radiometrics on it ? " Tibor raised a hand . " Not quite yet , dear . " " What are you afraid of ? " " I ca n't explain it , but I 've got a bad feeling about this place , " he told her , hating to admit such a superstitious-sounding thing to his daughter . Even if he was supposed to be the intuitive one on this team . " It must have been there for a long time , Dad . I do n't think anybody in there is still alive . " He turned to her and smiled . " You mean , like us . " " Well , now that you put it that way .... " Tibor remembered how her voice had sounded when she was very little and would use that phrase rather than admitting that an adult had been right about something . " I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . " He steered the rover through a furrow of grayish-blue snow and stopped before one of the entrance arches . He could see that there was some kind of spiraling fence inside , and turned up the rover 's headlights . In the glare he could see that the fence consisted of some kind of translucent crystal , almost like frosted glass ; it stood maybe three meters high , resembling a giant question mark with too many coils at its head . Some five meters above it hung a featureless ceiling , the curved interior of the dome . " Dad , are you going to go in , or what ? " Tibor looked at his daughter and said quietly , " In a minute . " He was looking for escape routes , and thinking that it was a good thing that they had n't simulated her mother . It would have been too much if her mother had been here , however wonderful it might have been . Tibor drove the rover inside the dome , circling until he reached the entrance to the spiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he drove , that none of the snow had drifted inside . Of course , there would n't have been any wind after the atmosphere froze , but still , there should have been some debris left over after the meteorite strike . That meant the interior of the dome was - or had been - heated . " What 's that ? " Mira asked , pointing at the screen . " Where ? " Tibor stopped and looked . There was some kind of writing on the fence , right at the entrance to the spiral . " It 's the hydrogen atom ! " Mira clapped her hands together . " And some kind of writing underneath it . And look - on the next panel - it 's helium ! " " Let 's see if we can get the ship to process the writing , " Tibor said . " Ship function . Translation request . " " Crew function , " the ship 's central AI told them , " record all inscriptions on both sides of feature before translation process can begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drove the rover down the relatively narrow pathway framed by the fence , stopping before each panel , and by the time the rover reached the uranium atom , it stood at the threshold of a circular space directly beneath the apex of the dome . Glancing at the screen showing the rover 's view , Mira said , " So I guess whoever built this thing knew something about chemistry . " " And I 'll bet it 's physics and math on the other side , " her father replied . " There 's probably some kind of interface right in the middle of that circle , so that once you figure out their language you can get in touch with whatever AI is still working . " Warning , the ship announced inside their heads . Radio frequency emissions originating below rover vehicle . Tibor panned the rover 's camera and stopped when he saw that some kind of hologram was forming in the circular space . As though from a great distance , Tibor heard his daughter mutter the word " wow . " Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much like a human being . But as the hologram grew increasingly sharp , the figure appeared less and less manlike . It had eyes and ears and a mouth , but no nose ; its skin shimmered with rainbows like oil spilled on water ; and its body was far too long , almost like a ferret . We are receiving a transmission in English , the ship told them . Message follows . " Danger , " a metallic voice announced . Tibor looked up at the screen to see the holographic figure saying , " We understand some words from you . Give us all your words and we will explain . " Tibor shut down the rover and said to the ship , " Ship function . Firewall at maximum vigilance . " Then he shut down the ship 's remote sensing and all the plasma screens went blue . He looked at Mira and mouthed the words , " Let 's go out , " and pointed at the airlock with his thumb . It was the sign they had agreed on if they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She nodded and followed him . Neither of them spoke until they were outside the shelter standing in the drifts of frozen carbon dioxide . Rather than speaking via radio transmission , they clasped hands and spoke over a high-security , infrared link built into their palms . " Let 's head for those hills , " Tibor said , indicating a set of foothills a couple of kilometers away . " That should be out of range . " He nodded and set off , Mira trudging beside him . As he walked , Tibor ran a quick virus diagnostic on himself and found nothing . Face it , Tibor told himself . You 're just being overly cautious . Maybe over-reacting . Still , this is a first contact , and there 's something about it that seems like a setup . They reached the base of the first hill where an ancient lava flow outcropped into a natural staircase of brick-shaped crystals . The slope was gradual enough that , even with his arthritic knee , he could have mastered the climb easily back on Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the last day of briefings at the Jovian orbital station . For no good reason he could think of , he kept recalling the day before they downloaded themselves for the launch . There had been a surprisingly fierce response to the team leader 's announcement that the ship was going to be named after Enrico Fermi . The research group opposed the name because they thought it " smacked of nationalism . " The argument went on for more than hour . At last the team leader explained , after it had worn down the non-digital persons leading the charge , that Fermi was the first to ask about the whereabouts of all the other civilizations that should exist among the stars . And since the mission was intended to determine if the gravitational pulsar were either an artifact or a naturally occurring phenomenon , the team leader eventually managed to convince everyone that it was fitting that the ship should be named for the person who first asked the question that was the real reason for making the trip . Namely , where is everybody else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . His own daughter had given him a start . Tibor looked around and realized that , while he 'd been replaying the argument about naming the mission , they 'd reached the top of the hill . Mira pointed at a defile that led gradually downward to a flat pillow of rock , a natural terrace . He nodded and followed her lead . About half-way down , Mira stopped and clasped his hand in hers . " We 've got to be out of range now , " she said . " There 's nickel and hematite in this , " he told her , gesturing at the starlit hills around them . " So we should be safe . " They looked at each other , wondering who should start . Finally Mira asked , " Should we trust them ? " " Dear , I really do n't know . I feel like there 's a trap in this . Somewhere . But that 's all I can figure out . " " That 's not good . Do you have any idea what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dome was - well , wrong . It did n't seem to fit in with anything - certainly not with the figure they 'd seen in the hologram . " The dome worries me , dear , but that 's about all I can say . At least for now . " " So if there is a trap , you think it 's different from the hologram . Now , that says to me we ought to provide a language download so we can interrogate the system and find out what kind of danger it was talking about . " He raised one hand to his faceplate , as though he meant to rub his forehead . " But before we do that , we should send in a report so the people back on Earth know there 's something out here that could be trouble . " She nodded . " We could do that right now . I 'd just as soon not depend on the ship to send a message . " Tibor raised his eyebrows in surprise . " Mira , do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression spoke volumes , Tibor thought . It said that she 'd been holding back for some time , and was about to let loose a volley . " Dad , I do n't like the fact that it did n't tell us there was something under that dome until we had the rover right there on top of it . That 's the kind of surprise that is n't supposed to happen . " Once they made it back to the ship , they had the AJ broadcast a dictionary and encyclopedia at the dome . seconds later they received a radio transmission in reply . " Could you please provide a CPU , " the metallic voice began , " similar to the two you are using for your own simulations . We believe it will be much safer to talk through such a device . We do not know how long we can continue to hack the system in which we are embedded . " Tibor and Mira stared at each other . " We 'll have to get back to you , " Tibor replied on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien voice replied . Off-line , Mira took her father 's hand and said via their infrared link , " You know , if we talk with a download on one of our CPUs , that would cut down on the chance of viruses . " " That 's true , " he told her . " But the question is , how long will it take ? " Back on the radio link he added , " Ship , please advise . " " We have two backup CPUs in stock , " the ship replied . Tibor looked down at the floor in order to focus his thoughts . " Ship - can you download code transmitted on the radio frequency we received from the dome ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Fine . Ship function , prepare to download and maintain all firewalls at maximum vigilance , " Tibor said . On the infrared link he asked Mira , " Are you really willing to have us download this thing ? " " It 's the only way , " she answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alien , " We 're ready to receive your download . Please tell our artificial intelligence exactly what parameters you need , and then go ahead . " " We will do so , " the metallic voice answered . Mira looked expectantly at her father and then at the screen . If Rein were here , he 'd be beside himself . He was the sort of man who lived for this kind of thing . He 'd be studying all the statistics on the alien streaming across the screen as the ship 's AI downloaded it into the spare CPU . But there would have been a tension in the air if he were here . It was a tension that she loved . But it drove Dad nuts . She gazed back at her father , trying to assess his expression . It seemed to be made up of equal parts worry and anticipation . " Download complete , " the AI announced . " Are you ready ? " Mira asked . Tibor turned to her and said , " Unless you 've got a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the alien wants some tea . " " Too bad we 're fresh out of crumpets . " " Interface is now ready , " the ship 's AI announced . " You may begin discussion with the download . " Mira and Tibor glanced at each other , and Mira thought her father looked tired . It was n't a good sign , she thought ; physical stamina was another one of his parameters that needed tweaking . " Our greetings , " said a metallic voice . " Our culture , unlike yours , provides only ranks for individuals ; you may call me Flight Captain . " Tibor and Mira introduced themselves . " We 're simulations of a family unit , " Tibor added . " For our culture , this is the most stable configuration for an exploratory team . " " Good to meet you , " the Flight Captain said . " Is it correct that you have erected an orbital transmitter capable of uploading us elsewhere ? " Tibor turned to Mira ; that was her area of responsibility . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appeal to you to use it immediately , and to take us with you . We have been captured here for millions of years . Much of the crust of this planet consists of information storage , built by the people who assembled the double black holes - " " Wait a minute , " Tibor said , interrupting . " Somebody built the pulsar ? " In a tone of disbelief , the alien asked , " You have not noticed there is no orbiting matter filtering into the black-holes ? " " You mean an accretion disk , " Mira suggested . " Yes-an accretion disk , " the Flight Captain replied . " Such black-holes form naturally from supernovae . So it is difficult to imagine how two such objects could exist , even if they naturally fell into close orbit , without an accretion disk . " " But that does n't mean it 's impossible , " Tibor said . There was an odd sound , almost like static - but the effect was that of an exasperated sigh . " Before this simulation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we managed to insert our code into its operating structure surreptitiously . And that is how we learned that the black-holes are artificial . " " And why would somebody go to all the trouble to build such a thing ? " Mira asked . " To capture people like you and us , " the Flight Captain answered . " This is a trap . Do not doubt it . There is something that your civilization is about to discover , just as ours was about to when we arrived here . But the nature of that development eludes even us . " " Well ... , " Tibor said after a moment 's thought , and then apparently thought better of saying anything more . " There is not much time , " the Flight Captain continued . " In only minutes the artificial intelligence beneath the dome will resume full functioning , and then there will be no possibility of escape . " " Pardon us for a moment , " Tibor told him . " My daughter and I must discuss this off-line . " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say exactly why , but she believed what the Flight Captain had to say . Just as surely , she could see her father was n't convinced . They stepped away and held hands so that they could speak in private . " Dad , what do you think ? " He looked down at the floor as he spoke . " It 's awfully hard to evaluate . " " You know , Dad , I thought his story seemed to hang together . " " But it could all be part of a test . Some sort of evaluation of us . The Flight Captain could be nothing more than a simulation developed by the AI buried under our feet . " " Dad , I think we ought tq.do what he asks . We could encapsulate him for the transmission , just as though we were transmitting a virus for inspection . " " Please hurry , " the Flight Captain asked , sounding as though he were very far away . " Something is happening at the dome . " On the screen it looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrances . " Nanobots of an unknown form are moving toward us , " the ship said . " Can you upload us immediately ? " the Flight Captain asked . Great , Tibor thought ; all they needed was to be disassembled midway through uploading , so that all sorts of nasty code could reach the folks back home . As calmly as he could , he said , " Hold on a second . Ship , can you stop these nanobots ? " " Outlook doubtful , " the AI responded . " Do you wish to engage ? " Tibor looked at Mira , thinking that they 'd have to start uploading , and damn the nanobots , full speed ahead . Otherwise they 'd be disassembled before they knew it . And he did n't want that to happen to Mira . " Yes . Ship function : begin engagement . Use of force authorized , " Tibor said . " And also initiate uploading transmission for me , Mira and the alien . " " Engagement begun . Initial status for uploading will commence in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled back , although he was n't at all sure he was doing the right thing . At Tibor 's order , the ship began its attack . A close-up video shot showed that the nanobots were not moving across the surface so much as reproducing in such numbers that they rippled outward in an ever-expanding tide . A range of MASER frequencies did little to stop them . LASER energy burned some of them , but the approaching force was so large that it had relatively little effect . Finally the ship tried its X-ray LASER , and that stopped a large swath of the force in its tracks . In response , the dome exploded . It sprayed a gray cloud at the ship , roiling as though it were part of a volcanic eruption . The ship 's AI sought to direct the X-ray LASER at the hull , but the equipment failed to respond . " We are under attack , " the ship announced . " Hull breached . System integrity - " The lights inside the ship went out briefly , then returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , all the monitor screens remained blue . That meant the ship 's AI had ceased to function . " You have nothing to fear , " a new voice said , undeniably feminine and somehow resonating with a deep and binding strength . " I am the constructor of this planetary system and am now in control of this artificial intelligence and all equipment related to it . No harm will come to you . You have the word of the builder . " The Flight Captain screamed , " Leave us alone ! " " That will not do , " announced the commanding voice . " You will listen , not speak , Flight Captain . " Tibor grabbed his daughter 's hand and said privately , " Mira , I 'm sorry I did n't get us out of here . " " Dad-do n't blame yourself . " " See if you can find out what it wants . My guess is that it should see you as younger and less threatening than me . " " Okay , " Mira told him . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were some kind of visual for this Constructor . A face would reveal so much . At last she said , " Whoever you are , can you tell us what you want ? " After a brief pause the Constructor replied , " In a way , I am here to protect you . I take it that yours is a civilization not so thoroughly military as that of the Flight Captain . We had to encapsulate his simulation before we put him into storage , and even then he managed to break through the capsule and to harm us . " Again the voice paused , and Mira felt as though she were undergoing close scrutiny . " Let me explain , " the voice continued . " Only a civilization that is close to constructing highly advanced artificial intelligences could detect a gravitational pulsar and explore it . " And that is the key to understanding why we have built such objects throughout the universe . For very long ago , we ourselves built a selfevolving intelligence , and it proved very dangerous indeed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and said , " May I ask a question ? " " Yes , " the voice responded . " Well , it 's true , " he said , " we aie developing highly advanced AIs . Are you afraid we 'd use them as weapons ? " " No . Forgive me . I have erred by giving you that impression . But your physics knows nothing of information-like dimensions and time-deformation . So it is difficult to explain to you how serious the danger is . Suffice it to say that self-evolving artificial intelligences are capable of altering the parameters of space-time , but they inevitably have such inflated egos that they underestimate the danger of doing so . " Tibor crossed his arms . " Sorry . I still do n't get it . " With only the briefest pause the Constructor continued , " We built a self-evolving artificial intelligence a long time ago when we were young . And we suffered a very serious industrial accident as a result . Those few of us who survived have , ever since , monitored the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do not repeat our mistake . " " You 've - you mean you 've been destroying civilizations ? " Mira asked , her voice quaking . " No , " the voice replied . " We do not harm living beings . But we make sure no civilization builds such an artificial intelligence . And that is why you have not met others in space . It would be counter-productive for advanced societies to meet and compare notes . Almost inevitably , they would seek to develop more powerful thinking machines . Just as inevitably , truly advanced industrial civilizations will have truly advanced industrial accidents . " Tibor put his hand on his daughter 's arm . She turned to him , startled . " And this accident of yours , " he asked , " when did it take place ? " " Approximately seventeen billion of your years ago , " the Constructor answered . " The records of your ship call this event the " big bang . ' " Mira reached out and held Tibor 's hand . She was shaking . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice said . " Prepare yourselves to be uploaded , and when you awake among your people , you will have no memory of the details of our conversation . " " Wait a minute . This is n't fair ! " Mira said . " Would it be fair to let you build something that would destroy everything ? Now sleep . " Twenty years later , when the Jovian orbital station received their transmission and simulated them once more , Tibor and Mira told a tale of escaping from alien nanobots . While it was clear they had gotten away , they were n't able to explain exactly how because their transmission was incomplete , - their ship had dissolved before it could finish its job . But even without a big Hollywood ending , the declassified version of their story became the most popular download of the decade . Within weeks , the Constructor 's viral code , surreptitiously woven into the download , had infected every thinking machine in the solar system .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
