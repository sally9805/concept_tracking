Tom Weiskopf is a brilliant , lovable , crusty curmudgeon who tortured himself for almost 40 years by getting firmly in his own way , on and off the course . With the best swing of his generation and perhaps the worst playing temperament of any generation , Weiskopf was always fascinating to watch , particularly when he would play himself into or near the lead . When things could get touchy , Tom could go crazy . He was the first in a long line of fine players to wear the " next Nicklaus " label  --  and fail to live up to it . No one was satisfied with Weiskopf 's career totals of 16 PGA Tour wins , including one major championship , because he should have won 30 times with 5 majors . Easily . His seven victories in 1973 , including the British Open , proved he could have the huge year everyone expected . But he promptly lost interest in trying to do it again . In a cozy room at the Weiskopf and Jay Morrish-designed Troon North Golf Club in Scottsdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the 61-year-old Weiskopf began an unprompted 40-minute stream of sensational stories , observations , self-criticisms , confessions , regrets and surprises .  --  When did golf cast its spell on you ? My dad took me to the U.S. Open at Inverness in 1957 when I was 15 . One guy stood out from the others  --  he was so fit and rhythmical and uncomplicated compared to the other guys . Effortless power . It was Sam Snead . That 's who I emulated . That 's how I thought the game should be played .  --  Ben Hogan also made an indelible early impression . I went with a friend in 1960 to see the U.S. Open at Cherry Hills . No offense to Arnold Palmer , but Hogan should have won that Open . He was playing with 20-year-old Jack Nicklaus and hit 34 greens in a row during the double round the last day before he was forced to gamble . If I could have putted for Hogan , Arnold would n't have won .  --  Did n't Jack , who finished second behind Arnold , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had equal chances to win , but Hogan putted badly all day and Jack putted poorly over the last nine holes . That was the last time Jack did n't putt great when it mattered . It was 1960 , and Jack was still in school at Ohio State , but he was already the best player in the world .  --  What do you base that on ? We had played that spring at the Scarlet Course at Ohio State , but that was casual and not revealing . When I saw him at the Open it was the real Nicklaus . It registered that this was the player who was going to dominate the sport . How could anybody beat him ? He had power , control , great tactical skills and a maturity that was unbelievable .  --  When did the rest of the world find out that Jack was the game 's best player ? In the 18-hole playoff for the 1962 U.S. Open against Arnold at Oakmont . It was all over by the end of the first hole . And everyone watching knew it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playoff . Arnold was introduced and all the cheers and everything . Jack is introduced , and Arnold smashes his first drive . Beautiful . Great driver of the ball . One of the best ever . My hero . I mean I love the guy . No one has ever treated people any better or had more of an impact on people . Now it 's Jack 's turn , and the cheers turned to jeers and snide remarks  --  did n't faze Jack at all . He just launched this drive . I walked it off : 28 paces past Arnold on the fly , 34 yards with roll .  --  How did Arnold react ? Arnold walked over the top of that first hill at Oakmont , and he saw that drive , and I knew then Jack had his number just by the look on Arnold 's face . Surprise ! His head went up . A double-take , almost . I 'll never forget that image . The game was over right there .  --  Arnold was composed enough to hit a beautiful approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shorter and better . Arnold never came close to him off the tee , and Jack hit his 3-wood past Arnold 's driver . I knew then it was going to be a long couple of decades for all of us.  --  And so it was . I 've had that feeling . You ca n't hit it any better and you know the long drive is your ball  --  and it is n't . That 's intimidation . That 's what Jack had on all of us . It 's the look he gave you on the 1st tee of the last round of a major that said , " You better play your fanny off if you think you 're going to beat me. "  --  You and golf were still in the honeymoon phase then . I started to play when I was 16 . The game came very easily . I shot 92 on a par-70 course the first time I played and was shooting in the 70s in three months . I loved that time , from the last two years of high school through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the camaraderie of other players who would give you the needle or question your club selections or course management decisions . I loved carrying my own bag and playing 36 holes , and playing for dimes and quarters against my friends . I did n't care about the gambling . It was the competition I loved .  --  How did you work on your game ? There were two football fields back to back where I used to practice , so I had more than 200 yards to play with . I 'd only hit iron shots . There was also a par-3 course I could ride my bike to down the lane . I was obsessed , and I loved it . I was still an easygoing guy then . I was happy if I played well but not unhappy if I did n't . People were helpful with advice , and I was able to accept help .  --  When did you stop loving golf ? After my second year at Ohio State  --  at exactly the time I decided to quit school and turn pro . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicklaus 's discipline and patience and course management skills . I could n't stand any shot I struck that fell short of perfection . I could n't forgive myself for mistakes . And I continued to feel the same way until I quit the Tour when I was 40.  --  Why ? I had wonderful parents , but I never had any direction . I never had a deep or close relationship with my father . He was a very shy guy , a very religious guy . I was an altar boy until I was a freshman at Ohio State , but once I left home I found out about drinking , partying and girls .  --  Did n't you find out about drinking in your own home ? Alcohol never had a positive effect on me or my dad . It left me angry and sometimes impaired my judgment . Now that I have n't had a drink in five years I see this clearly . My dad was a hard-working guy , a train master on the railroad , and he got drunk because he got upset when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had fired someone . He would get drunk and fall asleep on the couch .  --  Did n't he fire his best friend just before the friend would have received his pension money ? That 's when he became drunk all of the time . My dad was drunk , my mom let me get away with everything , and that 's why I loved hanging with the guys  --  because they provided direction . " Why did you do that , Tom ? Gee , you 're a dumb s  --  t , Tom . " It was like a town hall meeting . That 's where I got some love . My friends gave me a lot of help . That 's why I liked hanging out with them . With the guys , the boys . I appreciated that .  --  It took your dad 's dying to get you to play the best golf of your career . I always felt that when someone close to me died this light would come on . I would wonder why I let that person down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . I had my best year in 1973 because my dad died and I wanted to show him how good I could be .  --  Why did n't your desire for greatness last more than one season ? I had a chance to win 11 times in 1973 and won seven . I win Colonial , and then I win again , and then I go to play Troon in the British Open and I 'm just so confident , and I won there . But the whole thing is not what I thought it would be . You 're too much in the fishbowl . I felt like I had accomplished what I wanted to . Where 's your privacy ? Too many interviews , too many distractions . It was great , but I did n't want to do all the work it would take to do it again . Reaching my goals once was good enough . I did n't care anymore . I know people think that 's a cop-out , but that really was enough for me . I was not a great player . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snead and Hogan and Nicklaus and Player  --  they were great . I was close . Had I won a few more majors and a lot more tournaments then I would have been great . I was right there with any of them as a striker of the ball . But it does n't just get down to ball striking .  --  Tell me about winning at Troon for your only major . The course was so hard and fast , and I was confused about how to play it when I first arrived . I was hitting a lot of 1- and 2-irons off of tees and into the greens in practice . The dry conditions neutralized my long game . Then on Tuesday it started to rain , and I was able to take advantage of my strengths . I was driving the ball so long and so straight that even my misses were n't far off line . I played a very aggressive game all week . I 'm excited about going back there this year . You are always their Open champion when you win there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of golf for a former Open champion than the walk up the 18th hole each day . The Scots have been great to me.  --  What made you decide to play the Open at Troon again this summer ? The last time I played the Open at Troon , I three-putted from 33 feet on the last hole to miss the cut . I was devastated . My friends started suggesting during the 2003 Christmas holidays that this might be the last time I could play the Open at Troon . I 'll be the oldest player in the field , I suppose . But winning the Open has meant so much and given me so much . It 's the most prestigious championship in golf . I would regret it if I did n't go back .  --  Are you tuning up your game ? I started practicing in April , and I 've seen enough progress to know I wo n't embarrass myself . Making the cut is a possibility , and that 's my goal . I 'd also like to see Tiger play . I admire him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 've never seen him hit a shot in person . I heard he likes to play at six in the morning . I do too .  --  Maybe you should call him and ask to play a practice round . I would love to . If I had one wish , that would be the wish . I wonder if he would accept that invitation from me . I would n't ask him about his game unless he wanted to talk about it . I really respect him , and while he says there 's no pressure , there is outside pressure . He has to answer all those questions : " Why are n't you winning ? " That 's pressure . It wore me out .  --  You 're also going to play the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond Golf Club , one of your best course designs . It is without a doubt my proudest work , and I am proud of them all . This was a blank canvas on one of the world 's great properties . The site was so perfect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of my greatest experiences  --  living and working for two summers in Scotland as part of the first American architectural team to design a course in Scotland .  --  What 's more fun , winning tournaments or building winning courses ? As a player you 're as good as your last win . Design is everlasting  --  a work of art on the ground . It is n't going to go away . All I 'm looking for is a compliment . I am trying to avoid controversy  --  I had enough of that as a player . It 's wonderful to see someone hit a semi-blind shot and then run up the hill to see the ball come to rest just where it should be .  --  You were introduced to the classic designs of Alister Mackenzie when you played the Scarlet Course at Ohio State . I had access to Mackenzie 's papers there . I studied his routing and how he seamlessly incorporated natural features . Invaluable , fascinating stuff . Then I began studying the work of the greats : Donald Ross , A. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dye was great about sharing his knowledge with me , and Nicklaus adopted some of my suggestions when he built Muirfield Village . My first course with Jay Morrish , right here at Troon , was well received . That helped give us instant credibility . And I 've never changed my philosophy . My firm never takes on more than three to five projects at a time , and our attention to detail , from routing to grand opening , is meticulous and caring .  --  What do you think of Jack Nicklaus-designed courses ? I did n't like his change to the 3rd hole at Augusta National . He took away the wonderful angles Mackenzie and Jones built into the hole . Jack 's course presentations can be severe because they are lateral . The greens are built on the diagonal , like the 12th green at Augusta National , which is a one-club green . It 's a shallow green that calls for a very precise shot . When Ross or Mackenzie built shallow greens , they 'd require two clubs to cover the green from front to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jack 's courses .  --  In 1972 you beat Lee Trevino in a 36-hole final match in the Piccadilly World Match Play Championship at Wentworth , England . Any gamesmanship that day ? He had played Tony Jacklin the day before and they were a zillion under par . As we stood on the 1st tee , Lee was spouting off , telling me how tired he was and how draining the match was and how the food was no good , the whole " woe is me " deal . Just on and on . I said , " You know what , Lee ? It was an exciting match . Good luck . Play well . And do n't try to talk to me anymore . " I threw it right back in his face . He tried to catch up to me . Well , he ca n't walk as fast as I do . I just out-walked him the first two or three holes and he knew I was serious . I wanted to wax him because he was the man then  --  he was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got to him . And I beat him . He and Tommy Bolt and Sam Snead are just behind Hogan in my vote for best ball striker . Trevino was the best ball striker of my era , an era with perhaps the largest number of great players .  --  What did you learn from Tommy Bolt when you went to see him in your early 20s ? So many things . One , I learned to shorten my backswing and quiet my hands . Then he taught me how to hit a soft , high cut . And he taught me about tempo . He encouraged me to hit pitching wedge instead of sand wedge from 80 to 95 yards . Taught me how to dress too . Just by watching him . Two colors are easy , but he had three or four colors . It could have been two colors in his shoes , but those colors would spin off everything else . He could contrast three colors and make it blend . Tommy 's fantastic .  --  Are you sorry you went hunting instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cup Team ? Absolutely . That is one of my regrets . The hunt could have been done another time . I made a decision . As I look back , it was the wrong decision . But that is stubborn Tom  --  the German , stubborn personality . I was tough to live with . I got crucified for that . Rightfully so .  --  Why did you decide to quit the PGA Tour at 40 ? I had at least five more good years left . There were only a few guys who won more tournaments than I did in my time : Jack , Arnold , Casper , Trevino , Miller , Player and Watson . I had just eliminated the flawed position of my club at the top when I quit . I should n't have quit . But I 'm glad I did . I could n't stand the frustration of leaving on Sunday knowing I 'd finished 30th when the course was right there for me to finish in the top five . I could n't deal with my mediocrity , which is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how big a problem was your drinking ? I hit the ball so good from the age of 35 to 40 . But my nerves were not good because of the drinking . Then I got on guilt trips about what I did n't accomplish and that got very emotional . I did n't quit drinking until the year 2000 . I did n't drink every day . I could go months without drinking , but when I did it , Peter , there was n't enough to drink . I felt so bad the next day . I was just punishing myself . Every really stupid decision I made can be attributed to drinking . I was on the edge , self-destructive , out of control . I got very melancholy  --  like my dad .  --  What can other people learn from your experience with alcohol ? If you think you have a problem , you do . If drinking affects your efficiency and your desire and motivation , then you have a problem . Drinking affected my career and it affected my life . It took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; I like myself when I do n't drink .  --  What was bothering you ? I was frustrated . I needed to do something else . I asked myself , " Do I still want to wake up on January 2 , start practicing , working real hard , trying to beat the young guys coming out , maintain that motivation all the time ? " When I joined the Senior Tour I had one goal  --  to win the U.S. Senior Open . When I won it in 1995 with the best ball striking of my career , I got out .  --  Did you know how you wanted to spend your time after you left the Tour ? I always wanted to pursue golf course design . Design is my passion . I am still as interested in everything about it as I was 20 years ago .  --  You 're an expert on many things related to Augusta National . What did you think of Phil Mickelson 's win ? My career has been defined by The Masters . I was never the same after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , but this could be the beginning of Phil . This was the greatest Masters I have ever seen , bar none . It was like a murder mystery . There were so many subplots : This guy is going to do it . No , it 's this guy . Ah , this guy will do it for sure . There was so much misdirection , as though it were all plotted out in advance . You want my take on Phil 's final birdie putt on 18 ?  --  Yes , please . It looked like the ball had to break more than it did . But Phil 's a left-handed putter  --  his stroke is different . His inside-out stroke hooked the ball into the slope . The spin he put on the ball kept it from breaking as much as it would have for a right-handed player .  --  Why did Mickelson seem different this time ? He was a different guy , totally in control . He was on a mission . Everybody says , " I 'd like to be in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's tough . I never disliked being in that position , but it is tough . It 's like a heavyweight championship fight as the players feel each other out . Phil was ready for the fight .  --  Why was losing to Nicklaus at the ' ' 75 Masters impossible to set aside ? Scars do n't heal . They did n't heal for Arnold after he lost a big lead and the U.S. Open to Billy Casper at Olympic in ' ' 66 . They did n't heal for Tony Jacklin after Trevino chipped in or holed bunker shots five times the last two rounds of the ' ' 72 Open Championship at Muirfield . There is something that stops you . It 's so hard to swallow and the thoughts never leave you . I still think about that ' ' 75 Masters today . It just killed me.  --  It never happened to Nicklaus . And that 's why he 's the greatest of all time .  --  How will you be remembered ? I was one of the best players of my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to it , I could play as well as anybody can play this game . But I wo n't be disappointed if , when I 'm long gone , I 'm considered a better designer than I was a player . WEISKOPF TEES OFFTom Weiskopf produces sound bites by the bucket . A few extras from Table // his talk with Peter Kessler :  --  " Sure , I wanted to win The Masters , but not as much as I wanted to win a U.S. Open . "  --  " When I see drunks , I wonder if that 's how I looked . "  --  " I played eight rounds with Ben Hogan , and even when we shot the same score I felt like a child in his presence . "  --  " Billy Casper would n't hole out on the last green if he was shooting a big number  --  to protect his standing in the Vardon Trophy race . He 'd say , I hurt my back raking that bunker . ' ' "  --  " Jack Nicklaus was a bad short-iron player because MacGregor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny Miller got the yips and he did n't even drink ! He 's been tougher on players lately  --  maybe old age is creeping in. "  --  " I consider Tiger 's feat a Grand Slam . I do n't buy into Arnie and Jack 's saying it does n't count because he did n't win them all in one calendar year . He had all four at one time . That 's a slam . "  --  " If they keep changing Augusta National , in a few years it 'll be up for Best New Course .
