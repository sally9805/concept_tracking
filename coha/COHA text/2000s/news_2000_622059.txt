<p> Tiger Woods has won the most important tournament of his life on the course of his boyhood dreams , with his father watching on Father 's Day . How was your Sunday ? <p> Woods obliterated the field in the 100th U.S. Open yesterday , winning by a mind-boggling 15 shots . He shattered a laundry list of Open records , and did n't even make a bogey on his final 18 holes . He was so dominant , in such command , he was actually asked if he would have preferred the excitement of a battle to the finish . He answered quicker than a downhill putt on the seventh green . <p> " Gim me that 9- or 10-shot lead , " he grinned . " Every single time . Now I realize why most of the golfers out here are balding and gray . " <p> With a forecast for more gray and less hair , this is the dawning of the new age of Tiger Woods . He 's been an international media megastar for years now , but winning yesterday 's United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't think the players do n't know it . <p> R.J. Harper , the director of golf at Pebble Beach , was standing on the 18th green for the trophy presentation yesterday . He turned to two-time Open winner Ernie Els and congratulated him on his second-place finish . <p> " Fifteen strokes off the lead , " Els replied , shaking his head and squinting at the scoreboard . " Fifteen strokes off the lead . " <p> Hey Ernie , it 's not like it has never happened in a major championship . Old Tom Morris set the previous record when he beat Will Park by 13 shots in the British Open . Of course , that was in 1862 . <p> " Hopefully , " said Padraig Harrington , who tied for fifth , " he 'll tell us he used his A game today . " <p> Actually , no . The new Tiger is working a kind of Zen angle . He rarely pumped his fist , hardly changed expression , and when he was handed the silver trophy , he was so casual that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . Looking for the genie , probably . <p> " There is a point in time when you feel tranquil , " Woods said , noting that he had the same feeling at Augusta in 1997 when he won the Masters . " You just feel at ease with yourself . To have those weeks coincide with major championships is even better . " <p> That 's one way of putting it . Most people would prefer what Mark McCormack , the CEO of Woods ' management firm , said earlier in the week : " Arnold Palmer was the Thomas Edison of golf . Tiger Woods is Bill Gates . " <p> If there were any Tiger-critics before this week , they 're gone now . Oh , there were those who saw Woods 4-putt the ninth green at the Olympic Club in 1998 , or bunt a 2-iron down the fairways of Congressional in 1997 because he feared he could n't keep his woods on the fairways , and wondered if he could ever harness his game for the most maddening and demanding setup of all the majors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , were not completely out of line , at least on the golf course . Both were seen as big hitters with shaky control , who could get hot . Consider that when this Open teed off , Daly and Woods had each won the same number of majors  --  two . <p> Significantly , Woods was way ahead of everyone . After his breakout Masters win in 1997 , people shook their heads when he announced that he was remaking his swing . And when he struggled , mildly , there were doubters . <p> It was a gutty move , but he was right . Woods said it again yesterday : When he won the Masters , he was so young he did n't know what he did n't know . <p> " To be honest with you , " Woods said , " even when I won the Masters , it took me two or three years to actually understand what I had done . " <p> Now he knows . Woods not only dominated this course , he scattered a field of the greatest golfers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Open records kept unscrolling on the TV screen : most under par , largest margin of victory , lowest 72-hole score , and on and on . <p> Not that he was counting . Or even paying attention . There was speculation during the final round that Woods was checking off entries in the record book as he played . Actually , he insisted he only had one goal yesterday : no bogeys . <p> " I 've been told that I 've set a few records , but I do n't really know what they are , " Woods said . " The only thing I know is that I got the trophy sitting right next to me . " <p> The comparisons with Jack Nicklaus , once considered hype , are suddenly reality . They are nearly dead even in wins at the same age , have an almost identical number of " majors " and the hunt is definitely on for Jack 's place in history . <p> No wonder Woods was n't doing handsprings across the 18th green . As veteran Hale Irwin said this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . " For Woods it is just another step on the ladder . Want proof ? He fielded at least three questions yesterday about his chances at next month 's British Open . <p> It has already been a remarkable run for a kid just four years out of college . Woods has not recorded a CD , starred in a major motion picture or been seen at clubs with Cameron Diaz on his arm . He has not been in a beef with anyone at a bar or been stopped for roaring down the freeway at 140 mph in an exotic sports car . He does not wear an earring , a goatee , or  --  at least as far as anyone knows  --  a tattoo . <p> Bit by bit he has trimmed Team Tiger down to the essentials . Mike " Fluff " Cowan , the colorful mustached caddy , is gone . Too much attention . Tiger runs his own show now , and unlike the excited kid who roared and pumped his fist around Augusta in 1997 , he 's a mature , confident man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing yesterday , however . Few will forget the scene when Woods won the Masters and ran into the embrace of his father , Earl . Tiger 's dad taught him the game , took him to Pebble Beach when he was 12 years old , and used to prowl the fairways with him during junior tournaments . <p> They used to watch the AT &T; Pro-Am on TV together . As a reward , Tiger named his dad his playing partner at his first AT &T; Pro-Am as a professional , in 1996 . <p> Earl Woods does not travel much now . His health has not been terrific since heart bypass surgery , so he was not there to see his son accept the trophy . But he was watching at home in Cypress , down in Southern California , and he was remembered . <p> " It 's not too bad a Father 's Day present , is it ? " Tiger asked . " To have my dad still alive , while I won this championship , on Father 's Day , it 's very important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trophy ) to my dad and let him rub it a little bit . " <p> Now all he needs is a challenger , a Nicklaus to his Palmer . Good luck . David Duval and Sergio Garcia have been run up the flagpole , but no one is saluting . Woods is just so damn intimidating . <p> " Yeah , he can be beat , " said Rocco Mediate , who finished tied for 32nd . " But over 11 , 12 years , the rest of us have no chance . He 's not going to win every week , just nine , 10 or 11 times a year . " <p> Looking across the fairways , littered with gasping contenders , it is hard to imagine who will challenge Woods in the coming years . He 's won the Open now ; three more and he ties Nicklaus . He 's won the PGA , and basically started his career with a victory in the Masters . The British Open next month is at St. Andrews , a wide-open track that 's set up for his big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slam in his bag before he turns 25 . <p> At this point , the way he is monopolizing the game , there may be only one way to stop the Bill Gates of golf now . A federal judge is going to have to break up Tiger Woods . <p> C.W. Nevius can be contacted for questions , comments , and suggestions by e-mail at cwnevius@sfgate.com.
