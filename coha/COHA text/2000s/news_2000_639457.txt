<p> College students , welcome to spring semester 2000 . <p> Now , hit the snooze button , roll over and go back to sleep . <p> You do n't have to go to class anymore . <p> As of this school year , 10 commercial companies are posting lecture notes on the Web without the professor 's permission or knowledge , raising a host of ethical , legal and education issues . The companies pay students up to $ 400 a semester to post their notes online . <p> Last fall - the first semester that pirated notes ended up on the Web - every lecture in 36 of Colorado State University 's 1,500 courses was available for free on StudentU.com . Lecture notes from 21 courses at the University of Colorado at Boulder also were available on the site . <p> Last week , as students returned to school from semester break , new postings already were popping up - art history and geology at CU Boulder , for example , economics at CSU . <p> Class notes from the Colorado schools are offered alongside notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . <p> The Web sites are supported by advertising : credit-card companies , drink-mixing books , Internet shopping malls and online greeting cards . <p> Some Colorado professors were incensed to learn this month that their lectures were distributed by the money-making ventures . They say they are outraged that profits are being churned off the product of their mind , and they claim copyright violations . <p> They question the accuracy of the notes and say it creates a new atmosphere of distrust between professors and students . Other professors were surprised when contacted by The Denver Post , but see it as an educational tool that could help students who miss class because of illness . <p> Not Ginger Guardiola , who teaches Western Civilization at Colorado State . <p> ' It 's very shocking . I feel cheated , ' she says . ' Here 's my ideas , my words and they 're being published without my permission . In my opinion , the Internet is no different than publishing my lectures in a book without my permission . This intrudes on my rights as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her students was hired by StudentU.com to submit notes from her lectures . Students who used the notes gave them four stars on the company 's rating scale . The rankings range from five stars - ' helped me ace my exam ' - to one star - ' flush ' em . ' <p> ' This is right up there with buying a term paper off the Internet . It 's extremely unethical , ' says Guardiola . ' These things are an issue that professors will have to deal with more and more . It 's an ethics problem , and we 'll have to decide where we stand on them . The university should have a policy on this . ' <p> CSU and CU administrators are considering developing policies prohibiting students from selling a professor 's ' intellectual property . ' A half dozen colleges and universities nationwide have taken action ranging from a lawsuit to developing student honor codes that equate the practice to cheating . <p> The University of California system is suing one notes-publishing company , while Cal-Berkeley and UCLA have sent cease-and-desist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online notes company . <p> Kansas State prepared a legal statement for professors to attach to class syllabi claiming copyright protection and prohibiting students from selling notes without permission . Yet it 's unclear if copyright law protects lectures . <p> ' All those actions are in the realm of possibility for us , ' says Loren Crabtree , provost at Colorado State . ' This is so new we 're just beginning to discuss it . One of our concerns is who 's taking the notes ? Professors have the right to control their own classrooms . If there are professional note-takers in there - interlopers - that 's inappropriate , too . ' <p> CSU professors voluntarily put a variety of material on the Web , from study guides to lab experiments and sample test questions . <p> ' But then a professor has control over it , ' Crabtree says . ' This is different . This is an outside agency taking intellectual property and making an income off it - a very good income . ' <p> Guardiola will ask the companies to take her notes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with laptops and tape recorders . <p> ' Up until 45 minutes ago when you told me about this , I saw myself as having a good relationship with my students , ' she says . ' I tell them to talk to me about anything . But when people do things I consider a breach of my confidence , I feel like I 'm being taken advantage of . ' <p> The for-profit companies are brazenly in the open . <p> They advertise in campus newspapers , aggressively recruit paid note-takers and hand out fliers and freebies on campus - pens , T-shirts and coffee mugs . Students who use their Web sites are entered in drawings for televisions and Hawaiian vacations . <p> ' Academics for the E-Generation , ' is how StudentU.com pitches its wares . <p> Being a note-taker , the company 's Web site asserts , can be ' a great job experience to add to your resume . ' <p> ' I do n't think we can stop it unless we can take it to the courts , ' says Mathieu Deflem , assistant professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has launched his own Web site to combat note-taking companies . ' If just one college takes legal action , it will set precedent for every college and university . ' <p> But Deflem says he ' abhors these companies ' not on legal grounds but on educational grounds . <p> ' These are private companies that have nothing to do with the university , ' Deflem says . ' They are just out to make money . They completely lack accountability . They even say they do n't guarantee the quality of the notes . Students expect me to be qualified and to have a Ph.D . ' <p> Some companies say they are enhancing education by posting the notes and encouraging students to study online . <p> ' That 's a bunch of baloney , ' Deflem says . ' They have no expertise on education , no expertise on any subject matter , no expertise in teaching . When they say that , they do n't know what the hell they 're talking about . Do you know how long it took me and every Ph.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study and go to graduate school before we can say , now I think I know what I 'm doing . <p> ' These companies are one manifestation of a broader trend in our society to succeed at all costs - no matter if it 's legal or illegal , ethical or unethical . ' <p> Not true , says Brian Maser and Craig Green , co-founders of Study24-7.com. , which publishes lecture notes from 268 campuses . Childhood pals and co-captains of their high school football team in Miami Shores , Fla. , Maser graduated from the University of Florida and Green from the University of Pennsylvania . <p> ' We wanted to make a difference in higher education allowing college students to communicate and study online together , ' says Maser . ' The notes get the most attention , but we also provide interactive forums in chat rooms and discussion groups . ' <p> Last week Study24-7.com announced it 's inviting professors to submit their own lecture notes , host chat rooms and earn royalties . Student note-takers and professors will share 40 percent of the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of putting royalties in their pockets or putting them in a scholarship fund , ' Green says . ' We 're trying to show the universities and the professors that we 're on their side . We want to work together to enhance higher education . ' <p> Maser added , ' We 're not just a money-grubbing company . We 're giving it right back to them . It 's not wrong to make money off education . If you 're doing good and just for society , it 's OK to make money off that . ' <p> Meanwhile , Study24-7.com will continue to publish lecture notes solicited from students , a practice that Maser and Green say is legal . <p> ' When a student composes an interpretation of a lecture , the student owns the copyright of his or her notes . We 're working with the owner of the copyright , ' Green says . ' The professor has nothing to do with it . Professors who protest this are uninformed . ' Instead the issue is ' our First Amendment right to free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' Baloney ! ' says Deflem . ' Freedom of expression is about being able to have arguments and disagree . But what are they doing ? They are copying what I am doing . You have the right to express your opinion , but you do n't have the right to copy someone else 's . ' <p> CU-Boulder biology professor Jeff Mitton , whose genetics lecture notes were taken from his own Web site and posted on StudentU.com. last semester , is n't annoyed by his teachings appearing on a commercial company 's Web site . <p> ' I 've already made them public , so I do n't mind if someone spreads them around , ' Mitton says . ' Did they ask my permission ? No . Do I know who 's doing it ? No . But when I put it up on my own Web site , it 's public information to anyone in the whole world . It does n't matter to me if they copy it or use it to wallpaper their walls . ' <p> But some of his colleagues ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why . <p> ' It 's one thing to take them off a Web site which is a public document . It 's another to take notes and make money putting them in a public repository , ' Mitton says . ' Professors do n't like that because they 're not convinced that any one person can accurately represent what they said . <p> ' There 's no quality control . Are they going to spell the words right ? Are they going to put the emphasis on the right places ? Are they going to be there for the entire class ? And , do you really want to rely on them ? ' <p> Online notes , whether published commercially or not - might be a good idea , says CSU advertising professor Roger Lipker . <p> He walked into his class late last semester and found a student writing on the blackboard . It was the address of the commercial site where his lecture that day would be found . At first , the teacher was stunned . <p> ' It was a real eye-opener for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program and post my notes on my Web site so we can spend time doing other things in class . Students have always shared notes . The Internet just makes it more convenient . '
