Henry Tye transforms cosmology as inflation 's unsung hero . His latest pursuit : Where did our universe come from ? // " My entre to the field of inflation was magnetic monopoles . That and Henry Tye , " Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) physicist Alan Guth recalls . Tye , a physicist based at Cornell since 1978 - as a postdoc , then faculty member - introduced Guth to cosmology in the late 1970s . The two postdocs worked together closely , right up to the moment in December 1979 , when Guth - toiling on his own in the middle of the night - hit upon the notion of cosmic " inflation , " an explosive growth spurt in the infant universe . Inflation is now a central tenet of cosmology , and Guth became famous for his discovery , but he acknowledges his debt to Tye : " Henry contributed enormously . If it were n't for him , I never would have been in a position to come up with an idea like inflation . " Yet Tye has not received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Tye did nothing more than lay the groundwork for Guth 's grand leap - guiding Guth to the lop of the precipice , pointing him in the right direction , and then giving him a judicious shove in the form of a crucial hint - that alone would be a significant accomplishment . But Tye has played far more than a supporting role , moving on from that early collaboration to explain inflation through string theory . In addition , he 's shown how observations of cosmic strings - extraordinarily long , dense , thin filaments produced at inflations end - would not only affirm inflationary cosmology but also offer experimental validation to string theory itself , something that has been lacking for decades . Lately , Tye has developed new strategies for probing the universes origins . " If you look at his whole career , Henry really is an unsung hero , " says Joseph Polchinski , a physicist at the University of California , Santa Barbara . " He 's laid the groundwork for addressing important cosmoIogical questions through string theory . " Henry Tye 's early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , Tye came to the United States in 1967 to study physics at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) . He went to MIT for graduate studies , earning his Ph.D . in 1974 . After postdoctoral stints at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and Fermi lab in Chicago , he landed at Cornell , where he crossed paths with Guth - someone he 'd known vaguely from MIT . During lunch one day , they discussed magnetic monopoles - peculiar , hypothetical particles with an isolated ( north or south ) pole . After much prodding , Guth agreed to team up with Tye to determine the number of monopoles produced in the Big Bang . They came up with a large number , totally at odds with standard cosmology , because no monopoles have ever been detected . What could be suppressing monopole production , Tye and Guth wondered . The answer they hit upon was " supercooling . " When water is supercooled , for example , its phase transition from liquid to solid occurs well below the normal freezing point . Likewise , the phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoles could be delayed by supercooling so that it occurred at a lower temperature , with far fewer monopoles produced . This was a significant result , and they rushed to finish their paper before Tye left in late December 1979 on a 6-week trip to China . While revising the paper , Tye suggested to Guth that supercooling might affect the universe 's expansion , even though Tye had n't done the calculation himself . Guth explored this possibility on the night of December 6 and through the following morning . The then discovered that supercooling would have a tremendous effect on cosmic expansion , sending the universe into a period of runaway growth . Later that morning , he contacted Tye and asked whether they should mention this accelerated-growth phase in their paper . Tye hesitated because it sounded like they were invoking the cosmological constant to explain away monopoles , thereby solving one problem with an even bigger problem no one understood . With his trip imminent , Tye felt they did n't have time to address such a big new topic adequately in a paper that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , Guth asked if he could pursue a paper on the exponential-growth idea on his own . Given the competition they faced in this area , Guth felt like 6 weeks was long time to wait . Tye agreed and encouraged him to press onward . Guth wrote his landmark paper , and the rest is history . The trip to China was " memorable , " Tye says , apart from the establishment of the inflationary-universe theory that overturned cosmology while he was gone . " For one thing , I had n't seen my grandmother in a long time , " he recalls . But the main reason for his travels was a conference in Guangzhou , marking the first time since Mao Zedong 's ( 18931976 ) rule that physicists who had left China were allowed back into the country . " That was a big deal , " Tye recalls . " Things were finally opening up in China . " Yet the ill-timed journey exacted a steep cost on his career . " Had he not gone to China , Henry surely would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . But Tye has no hard feelings toward Guth . " Alan saw how exponential growth could solve many of the cosmological problems we faced , and he deserves the credit . " Nevertheless , Tye says he " missed the boat and would have to wait for the next big boat . " He was holding out for a big idea , as he did n't see the point of writing a small paper on inflation when hundreds of papers on the subject were being churned out . He turned to string theory in the hopes it could provide a more thorough understanding of inflation . Of branes and strings Tye initially thought it would take him just a year to devise a string-based model of inflation . " But after 2 years went by , and then 5,1 sort of lost hope , " he says . The problem , he explains , is that " string theory , as formulated in the 1980s and most of the 1990s , did not show where inflation could possibly come from . " A breakthrough occurred in the raid-to-late 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coined by Tye and a student . In 1995 , Polchinski showed that in addition to 1-dimensional strings , there are other fundamental , higher-dimensional objects in string theory called membranes , or " branes . " According to the braneworld view , our universe exists on one brane , and we could be unaware of other universes sitting on other branes in hidden dimensions . A 1998 paper by Nima Arkani-Hamed ( now at Harvard University ) , Savas Dimopolous of Stanford , and Gia Dvali of New York University showed that the extra dimensions of string theory could be large - on the order of a millimeter - which allows for branes to move in space . Tye immediately began contemplating new possibilities . Dvali gave a talk at Cornell in the fall of 1998 , and , afterwards , he and Tye took a long stroll through campus , circling picturesque Beebe Lake . " It was beautiful , but we were n't looking at the scenery , " Tye says . Instead , he and Dvali were trying to figure out how inflation works . During their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Inflation occurs as two parallel branes slowly come together under the tug of gravity until they eventually collide and melt , releasing the energy of the hot Big Bang . " Brane inflation , " as Dvali and Tye called it in their 1999 paper , offers an answer to the question that had plagued inflationary theory for 20 years : Where does the potential energy , or " vacuum energy , " that drives inflation come from ? Dvali and Tye say it 's simply the gravitational potential energy of two branes ( or two stacks of branes ) separated from each other in higher dimensions . The strength of that gravitational potential depends on the distance between the branes . This explanation provides exactly what is needed for inflation : A form of vacuum energy that remains almost constant at first , slowly diminishes as the branes approach , and ultimately is converted into matter and radiation . " Getting this to happen in string theory had been a formidable challenge , " says PoIchinski . " What Dvali and Tye did was fantastic . " Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very influential , " claims Clifford Burgess of the Canadian-based McMaster University and Perimeter Institute . A raft of string inflation models has come out since 1999 , adds Burgess , " and , with just one exception , all those models rely on the relative motion of branes to drive inflation . " The result was gratifying for Tye , who 'd taken 20 years to do something he initially figured to knock off in 1 . " But 20 years is still better than never " he says . Polchinski is impressed that Tye took his time before writing his first paper on inflation . " He did n't settle for some half-baked idea . Instead , he waited until all the ingredients were there to produce what still seems to be a great idea . " Furthermore , Polchinski notes , Tye did not sit around for 20 years doing nothing , but instead made fundamental contributions to string theory , developing some of the " ingredients " necessary for formulating ideas in string cosmology like brane inflation . Still much to learn In 2002 , following up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight : The collision marking the end of brane inflation leads to a phase transition that produces cosmic strings but no other defects . His calculations ruled out the creation of magnetic monopoles - the point-like defects he and Guth originally sought to suppress - and domain walls - sheet-like defects that would quickly dominate the universe and create a picture totally at odds with astronomical observations . In the simplest scenario , Tye says , a brane and " antibrane " would crash and annihilate each other , heating up the universe in the process . ( A brane has the same density as its antibrane but an opposite " charge . " Unlike an electric charge , this charge is carried by a string force . ) The cosmic strings emerging from this wreckage should survive and be detectable today , Tye predicts . Polchinski , among others , applauds the achievement . " You used to be washed up in physics by the time you hit 30 , " he says . But some of Tye s most groundbreaking work , like brane inflation and cosmic-string production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , Polchinski adds . " Rather than sitting back and trying to keep abreast of the literature , he 's still helping to shape the field . " Tye is not done " shaping . " He 's interested , among other things , in how astronomers might find cosmic strings . For example , he predicted a range of " tensions , " or energy densities , these strings should possess and the likely observational consequences . If cosmic strings are as heavy as once postulated in the 1980s , they would have left a dramatic imprint in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) that would contradict all empirical data . Values of string tension predicted by Tye , in the aftermath of brane inflation , are still within allowable limits . He estimates that up to 10 percent of the temperature fluctuations , or anisotropies , in the CMB could be attributed to cosmic strings . Instead of mapping individual points in the CMB sky , Tye suggests looking for adjacent regions that have slightly different temperatures . A fast-moving cosmic string ( they 're expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photons on the front side , making them appear " warmer " than photons on the back side . Researchers are now looking for this signature in WMAP data , and it should be even easier to detect when data come in from the Planck Telescope scheduled for launch later this decade . Tye 's major goal , of course , is to see a cosmic string . Then , scientists will try to measure the tension by gauging the string 's gravitational influence . String theory predicts that cosmic strings should have a range of tensions . The tension tells us the energy scale that prevailed during inflation . That 's because a cosmic string 's energy density is trapped forever at the inflationary energy scale . If string theory is right , says Tye , three cosmic strings should come together to form a junction . Spotting something like that in the sky would be a spectacular confirmation of both brane inflation and string theory as a whole . Tye considers brane inflation " a simple model that seems to be generic , " and he hopes it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the prospect of providing experimental support for string theory , which is supposed to be a theory of the universe of which brane inflation is just a part . " So much effort has been put into string theory , yet some people say it 's not physics , because after 20 years , we still ca n't make a testable prediction , " Tye notes . " That 's why I cant think of anything more important than determining the tension of cosmic strings . " From nothing , something Well , perhaps that 's not quite true . Tye has already turned his attention to another question that might be considered even more important : Where did our universe come from ? Perhaps , says Tye , the universe originated from nothing - no matter , energy , space , or time - by means of a " quantum fluctuation " in the same way particles pop in and out of existence , according to quantum mechanics . Ideas of spontaneous creation like this have been proposed since the 1980s - by Alexander Vileiikin of Tufts University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tye believes the problem is best approached through string theory , where both space and time are derived quantities , rather than eternal features of nature . String theorists now believe between 10,100 and 101,000 possible universes exist . If you start with nothing , Tye asks , which universe is preferred ? Our universe should begin with a state that has the maximum probability , he argues . And his preliminary calculations suggest a 4-dimensional inflationary universe similar to our own is , indeed , most likely . Tye hopes to find a way around the anthropic principle - an idea , simply stated , that we live in a universe with properties ( such as constants of nature and physical laws ) set the way they are because , otherwise , intelligent life-forms would not be around to ponder such questions . Many scientists find that line of reasoning unpersuasive , given that some forms of the anthropic principle are guaranteed to be true . Tye prefers to seek answers to our universe 's mysterious origins from fundamental physics and first principles , rather than from rhetorical arguments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how the universe could arise from nothing takes some chutzpah - it 's a high-risk endeavor Tye would have steered clear of earlier in his career . But he now realizes sometimes you have to be bold . More than a quarter century ago , when he shied away from inflation out of fear of getting dragged down by the cosmological constant , Tye learned a painful lesson : Timidity has a price . He used to worry about making a mistake . He 's since learned that " If I get something wrong , I 'll still live . Its okay for a theorist to be wrong every now and then , so long as you occasionally come up with a good idea . " By all accounts , Tye has had more than his share of the latter , offering potential solutions to some of the biggest quagmires of the day . Although he " missed the boat " back in 1979 , the vessels he 's caught since may carry us to the next level of understanding .
