<p> An Indianapolis bankruptcy judge could decide the fate of the Grand Prix of Denver today . <p> Open Wheel Racing Series LLC has offered to buy all of CART 's assets for $ 1.6 million in cash , including all contracts with venues , plus absorb about $ 1.4 million of CART debt . If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank J. Otte accepts OWRS ' $ 3 million proposal , a third Grand Prix of Denver is likely to take place Aug. 13-15 . <p> If Otte chooses the Indy Racing League 's bid of $ 3.3 million , which includes selected CART assets with no liability , the Denver race would come to an end - at least for 2004 . <p> A hearing is scheduled for today and a decision is expected by Friday . <p> ' Our general council , we 've walked this through him , and he does n't know , ' said John Frew , a lawyer and general manager of the Grand Prix of Denver . ' We 'll be as anxious as anybody to find out what happens . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series . The IRL intends to end it . <p> Otte wo n't concern himself with those intentions , said Dean Bonham of the Bonham Group , a Denver sports marketing company . <p> ' ( Bankruptcy ) judges historically have gone by primary criteria , and that 's to take care of the creditors , ' he said . ' They decide on what 's most suitable to get the most assets back to the creditors . ' <p> OWRS partner Paul Gentilozzi said his group would do just that . <p> ' We have teams representing more than 18 cars , a creative television package and a great race schedule all ready to go , ' Genti- <p> lozzi said . ' Our plan calls for a win-win situation for the teams , creditors , sponsors , promoters and the fans - a fact that will not go unnoticed in the courtroom . ' <p> IRL vice president Fred Nation , who revealed the IRL 's bid amount Tuesday , said his organization 's offer includes only one race contract - the Grand Prix of Long Beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by Dover Motorsports Inc. , but that relationship likely wo n't benefit Denver if Long Beach is acquired by the IRL in court . <p> ' Our bid is for the hard assets - the equipment , transporters , the medical unit - which is exactly the same thing as OWRS , ' Nation said . ' It will be easy for the judge to make an apple-to-apple comparison . But we also have bid on one soft assets , the contracts , but only the race at Long Beach . ' <p> The IRL , which races on ovals , plans to introduce road racing in 2005 . CART primarily has become a street- and road-course circuit , and Gentilozzi wants to keep it that way . <p> ' It 's clear what the IRL 's intentions are when you look at which assets they want to purchase , ' Gentilozzi said . ' They want to kill the series , yet they hide that fact under the pretext of ' unification . ' They 're not fooling anyone . ' <p> Nation said last month that the IRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets , even after the sale of OWRS and CART fell apart and CART sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . <p> Though the IRL 's bid exceeds its competition by about $ 300,000 , OWRS partner Kevin Kalkhoven hopes the judge will look beyond the difference . <p> ' We will continue the operation of the Champ Car World Series and what could better benefit the creditors , teams and sponsors , ' Kalkhoven said in a statement . ' In order to adequately compare the two bids , the court will look at which bid will ultimately deliver the highest distribution to the creditors and which is in the best interest of the estate . <p> ' Since the IRL bid is purported not to assume the majority of the liabilities , the other promoter contacts would become unsecured claims . The damages suffered would be very real , very significant and very costly . ' <p> Nation said the IRL is the underdog in the deal . <p> ' CART and OWRS have been working together for six months to make a deal , ' Nation said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be surprising if we end up being the winner . ' <p> For Denver race fans , an IRL loss could be a victory . If Otte sides with the IRL , Dover Motorsports would have little bargaining power in adding its Denver race to the IRL schedule in 2005 or beyond . <p> ' We did not bid on Denver , and it 's very highly unlikely the Indy Racing League would race the Denver race , ' Nation said . ' We race ( near ) Colorado Springs and think that it does n't make sense to have two races in the same metropolitan area . <p> ' But it does n't mean that we are n't going to discuss with promoters some of those race venues in the future . We just do n't think it 's necessary for us to buy the existing contracts . ' <p> Nation said the oval-only IRL would not be able to compete at Long Beach , the most successful street course in North America , this year . <p> ' They have a Plan B , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jim Michaelian , president and CEO of the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach , said in a statement : ' We are committed to conducting our 30th anniversary Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach event in the streets of Long Beach this coming April . a Our preference would be to continue on with our existing relationship and run the Champ Car race as the headline event . <p> " However , if that does not prove possible , then we will schedule the next best available alternative as a replacement .
