<p> Beijing  --  A landmark agreement Tuesday by North Korea to shut down its chief nuclear reactor and allow international inspections of the site is likely to be beset by a slew of difficulties , from persuading the nation 's reclusive leaders to abide by their commitments to verifying compliance , experts said . <p> U.S. officials hope the agreement , hammered out after six days of talks in China 's capital , will lead to the end of all nuclear programs in the small but heavily armed Asian nation . <p> North Korean officials pledged to seal " for the purpose of eventual abandonment " the Yongbyon nuclear plant and to prepare a list of all of its nuclear activities . <p> In exchange , the country  --  which became the world 's eighth declared nuclear state when it successfully tested a nuclear bomb four months ago  --  will receive millions of dollars in energy and economic aid and the possibility of improving relations with the United States and Japan . <p> Because the agreement does not include a timetable for the disposal of North Korea 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made into between six and 10 bombs  --  " it does n't give us any assurance that North Korea is committed to dismantling their nuclear program , " said Peter Beck , a North Korea analyst with the nonprofit International Crisis Group , headquartered in Brussels . <p> Beck called the document , reached in talks with North Korea , the United States , Russia , China , Japan and South Korea , " a small but meaningful first step . " <p> A lack of communication and trust between North Korea and the United States , as well as between North Korea and Japan , will be another hurdle to dismantling Pyongyang 's nuclear capability , experts said . <p> As part of the agreement , the United States and Japan each committed to beginning bilateral talks with Pyongyang to improve and possibly normalize relations . <p> " Without trust , there are many ways the agreement could fail , " said Zhang Liangui , a North Korea expert at the Central Communist Party School in Beijing .
