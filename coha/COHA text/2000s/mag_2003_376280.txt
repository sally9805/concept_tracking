After two days of emotionally charged testimony , a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 9 to 6 to recommend that silicone breast implants be allowed back on the market . Their sale was halted in 1992 because of concerns that leaking implants could cause serious illness . Later studies found no evidence that implants caused the myriad chronic diseases that had been attributed to them . But because of lingering concerns , the panel put conditions on their approval . The manufacturer must continue to follow patients for 10 years , it must give women coming in for implants information about scarring , ruptures and other complications , and it must advise women who get silicone implants to have annual exams to check for slow leaks . The FDA is expected to make its final decision within weeks and typically follows the lead of its advisory panels .  --  D.B.
