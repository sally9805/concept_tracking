Coming to Glorytown // God made everything and everyone . He even made Fidel Castro . That ? s what my abuelos , or grandparents , Ana and Julian Espinosa , always taught me . That meant the Revolution was God ? s doing , too . At the very least , He allowed it to happen . // When I was a boy , that made no sense to me . I wanted to know if we were being punished or tested . Nobody could tell me for sure . Abuela Ana wasn ? t complaining  --  she never complained about anything . She merely observed that God didn ? t miss a beat . We Cubans might have felt that He had abandoned us , but that wasn ? t true . // No. // It was the rest of the world that had forgotten about the people of Cuba . // That ? s what Abuela Ana said . And she should know , because even before Castro came to power when he overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista , life had been hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ours  --  started with sugarcane . Sugar is the lifeblood of Cuba , and the central province of Las Villas , where my people came from , is the heart of sugarcane country . // But farming sugarcane is brutally hard work . Both of my grand &shy; fathers had begun toiling under the Caribbean sun before they hit puberty : hacking at the tough canes with machetes , slapping insects , watching out for snakes , and hoping their exhausted neighbor ? s aim didn ? t go awry . In the old days , this was slave work . Each of my grand &shy; fathers dreamed of leaving as soon as he could , in search of a better life . Only my maternal grandfather , Abuelo Julian , managed to do that when he put down his machete and left the cane . elds in the farming town of Rodas in Las Villas in 1918. // My other abuelo , Alfonso Calcines , was a sharecropper in the town of Cumanayagua . He and my abuela Petra had seventeen children , twelve of whom survived childhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their youngest son . They rented a small house on land owned by a wealthy Spaniard . In return for their labor , they were allowed to keep part of the sugar crop . This provided them with their basic needs for food , clothing , and shelter  --  but nothing else . // When my father was eight , one of his brothers was killed in a shoot &shy; ing accident , and my grandfather died suddenly of " grief "  --  probably either a heart attack or an aneurysm . He left his family nothing but the clothes on his back and a few pieces of furniture . The wealthy Spaniard had no use for the rest of the family , so he told them to get off his land and make sure they didn ? t take anything that didn ? t belong to them . Even the machete was his . // Abuela Petra had a brother in the city of Cienfuegos . He offered to take in the family until they could get back on their feet . So one day Abuela Petra and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , four others had died of childhood maladies  --  walked thirty miles along the dusty roads of rural Cuba until they arrived at their new home . // Cienfuegos was called Cacicazgo de Jagua in the eighteenth century , when it was founded , then Fernandina de Jagua in the nineteenth cen &shy; tury , and . nally , Cienfuegos , after a Spanish capit ? n general . But its nickname has always been La Perla del Sur , the Pearl of the South . The buildings are well-constructed and elegant . Cienfuegos boasts the most geometrically perfect street plan in Cuba , perhaps in all of the Caribbean . It ? s said that one can shoot an arrow through the heart of town without ever striking a building . Before Castro came to power , the port bustled with ships sailing under every kind of . ag . A majestic Spanish fort , El Castillo de Jagua , still dominates the turquoise waters of the bay . // Some members of both the Calcines and Espinosa tribes eventually ended up in the barrio , or neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen , my father twenty-one . One of my mother ? s sisters , Violeta , was my father ? s neighbor . It was during one of my mother ? s frequent visits to see her sister that my father noticed her and began to think about settling down . // Felo had already been laboring for years on the docks , where he and his brothers had earned reputations as tireless workers . Decent-paying jobs for uneducated , untrained men were scarce , and they got used to defending their positions with the only means of arbitration they had  --  their . sts . But if another laborer collapsed under the brutal sun , as was common , one of the Calcines brothers would be there to carry the fallen man ? s load as well as his own . This way , although dockhands were paid by the load , the fallen man would receive his full pay at the end of the day . // My mother , Conchita , was . attered by Felo ? s attention . For three years , they invented reasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Violeta ? s home . It was improper for them to talk privately before being formally introduced , and that couldn ? t happen until Conchita was a little older . But the sidewalk was public territory , and their families could keep an eye on them , so the normal restrictions governing courtship were relaxed . In 1953 , they were married on June 19  --  the same day my abuelos Ana and Julian Espinosa had gotten married in 1911. // My mother had been a sickly child , and when she became pregnant with me , Abuela Ana was worried . But she needn ? t have been . My mother was tough , as the youngest of eleven must be , and Abuela her &shy; self would be there to handle whatever came up . // Childbirth was one of Abuela ? s numerous specialties . She ? d assisted at the births of all her twenty-nine grandchildren so far . But number thirty , she would say later , was the most dif.cult , because I wanted nothing to do with this world . I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conchita had gone to a birthing clinic , along with Abuela Ana and Papa , but somehow no one noticed until it was nearly too late that the clinic had no forceps . My father ran out and borrowed a pair , and it turned out to be too small . But it had to do . // The doctor dug deep , searching for my head , and in the process he nearly tore apart my left eye . Eventually , after a long struggle , I was born on October 4 , 1955. // Abuela Ana and Abuelo Julian had just bought a house at 6110 San Carlos Street  --  the . rst they ever owned . My parents lived in a room that Abuelo had added on to the back in anticipation of my birth . It had a bed , a cabinet , a small bathroom , and a window that looked out on the backyard . // The yard was small , maybe twenty by thirty-.ve feet , but it was . lled with mature tropical fruit trees : coconut , avocado , lemon , grape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or loquat . Their thick branches and broad leaves formed a canopy that cast a cool shade over the entire yard . This made it the perfect place to raise a few chickens , as well as their rooster , Pichilingo , who would become my best friend . In later years , I would spend hours sitting on the tile roof , learning how to com &shy; municate with tropical songbirds in their own language and envying them their ability to . y away . // The injury to my eye was painful . I had surgery at the age of one , and again at two . These operations were ultimately successful , but I had a lot of sleepless nights , according to Mama . She often said that her only company in those wee hours was Pichilingo , who scratched and crowed anxiously as I cried out my agony to the night sky . // I was a lucky kid , in the best way a kid can be lucky : I was loved . It was really as if I had four doting parents  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Abuela Petra loved me , too , but since she lived far away in another barrio , I saw her only occasionally and then she died in 1962 , when I was six . It was Ana and Julian who looked after me constantly while Pap //
