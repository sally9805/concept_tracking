ONE Pima County Forensic Science Center Tucson , Arizona January 7 The zipper on the body bag caught , and the technician gave it a hard , practiced yank . The stenches of death and the attendant chemicals roiled out of the cavity and , in the moment before Detective Tony Sonterra remembered my presence and eased me back with a slight motion of one elbow , the image of Jimmy 's youthful , ravaged face imprinted itself , hologram style , on every cell in my brain . Bile scalded the roof of my mouth . My name is Clare Westbrook , and I 've seen more than my share of corpses . I seemed to attract them on my own , and my association with Sonterra , who was a homicide cop at the time , merely compounded the problem . I turned away , doing my best not to retch . Jorge " Jimmy " Ruiz was sixteen years old . His dreams were heartbreakingly modest  --  he 'd wanted a car , cheap housing , and a dog that would come when he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he 'd turned up in Phoenix , hungry and ingenuous , and wangled a job with Sonterra 's family 's landscaping business . Customs and Immigration snagged the kid a few weeks after he arrived , during a routine green-card check , and promptly sent him home to Mexico . Sonterra stayed in touch with Jimmy after that , got him a room in Nogales , on the Sonoran side , then pushed up his sleeves and waded into the red-tape matrix . Probably because of his own Hispanic heritage , he 'd been determined to make a difference , if only for this one boy . I loved that about Sonterra , the way he would lock on to an idea if he thought it was right , and never let go . Our relationship was intense , and by no means simple . I 'd moved into his house , with my niece , Emma , and our two dogs , Waldo and Bernice , but I still had one foot in my old life . I 'd worked hard to get through law school , schlepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in my time at Kredd and Associates , where ambulance chasing was a specialty . It had been Emma and me against the world ever since my sister Tracy 's sudden disappearance , when Emma was only seven , and when it turned out that my sister had been murdered by someone close to her , my streetwise , foster-kid wariness went into overdrive . Trusting Sonterra , trusting anyone , was a challenge . Hell , I was n't even sure I could trust myself . Now , in the stark reality of cold storage , Sonterra 's voice seemed to come through a long , hollow pipe , even though we were within touching distance . " His name was Jorge Ruiz , " he told the attendant grimly . " No next of kin . " The tech nodded , blandly accustomed to the unclaimed and unmourned , handed Sonterra a clipboard , watched in silence as he signed off on the attached form . Another body identified . A complex life , reduced to words and numbers . A few check marks , a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more statistic to the column . I had n't been well acquainted with Jimmy , but I ached for him , remembering his shy smile , his ragged jeans and T-shirt , his amazing capacity for hard work . I knew he 'd slept on a cot on Sonterra 's dad 's sunporch during his brief stay in the USA , and been pathetically grateful for a place at the kitchen table . He 'd loved bologna sandwiches and lime Kool-Aid . I swayed , gripped the edge of a nearby steel table for balance , and instantly recoiled . The slab was bare , even sterile , but I had a sudden , swift sense of all the bodies that had rested there , for a brief and grisly interval , with only a toe tag to differentiate them from the other vacant shells of humanity that had passed through that place . I 'm not exactly squeamish , but I was in a morgue , and four months pregnant . Kay Scarpetta , I 'm not . Sonterra pressed a hand to the small of my back and steered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I sank onto a bench and dropped my head between my knees . " I asked you to wait in the car , " Sonterra said with a familiar note of resignation . He waited until I straightened , then handed me a paper cup with a slosh of lukewarm water inside . None of this was new to him  --  he 'd stood by many times , while a family member identified a victim , and even witnessed autopsies  --  but he was clearly shaken . I gulped down the water , waited to see if my stomach would send it hurtling back up or simply convulse around it with a couple of good clenches . I kept down the first dose , and threw back the rest . This would cinch it , I thought . Just the day before , Sonterra had fessed up that he 'd been offered a job with a federal task force . He 'd been closemouthed about the details , but I knew it had something to do with the stream of illegal immigrants flooding in from Mexico . Now , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole life upside down , and mine with it . " Coyotes , " he said . He was n't referring to the four-legged variety . In cop speak , coyotes are the sleazeball flesh-smugglers who run Mexican nationals across the border , into the land of milk and honey  --  for a price . They lock their " clients " up in the trunks of cars , in airless vans , and in " safe houses , " sometimes ten to thirty to a room , with little or no food , water , or sunlight . If things go sour in transit , they often shoot them in the head and leave them in the desert for the buzzards . And that 's the merciful method . The most common one is dropping them off miles from any road , without their shoes , if they had any in the first place , without water or food or any means to defend themselves . Duct tape and dehydration save on the high cost of bullets . Coyotes are in business to make money , and they do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , started across the parking lot toward his slick SUV , gleaming black in the winter sun . That 's the reason we Arizonans put up with summer temperatures in the 120-degree range  --  for the mellow months between October and April . The door locks popped audibly when he pressed the button on his key fob . We 'd discussed the new job , of course , but it was a source of conflict . It meant leaving the Phoenix/Scottsdale area , where I had friends and a pro bono practice I loved , for a wide spot in the road well off the beaten path . I was familiar with Dry Creek , a dust bunny under the bed of life , because of its proximity with Tucson , my hometown . I 'd gone there a lot , as a teenager , admittedly to party with other wild kids , and had always come away with one clear thought : Thank God , I do n't live there . It 's ironic how fate keeps track of blithe statements like that one and uses them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to play ball with the feds and sign on as chief of police in Dry Creek ? " The last chief , a man named Oz Gilbride , had disappeared into a parallel universe , a couple of months ago , under a cloud of controversy and suspicion . I remembered Oz from my misspent youth , too . He 'd run a lax department , which was why kids from Tucson liked to raise hell in and around his town . Since he 'd vanished , the news media had pegged Chief Gilbride as the lead dog in a very bad pack of coyotes , and maybe they were right . Maybe they were full of bullshit , too . I 'm not a fan of talking heads , lacquered and smiling , assessing the world from behind a news desk . Most of them , in my opinion , could be a little less interested in pursuing their personal political agendas and a lot more interested in telling the truth . It 's one thing to alert the population to corporate or government skullduggery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of fear into the collective consciousness just because there 's nothing else to talk about on that particular day . The sky is falling . Film at six . When Sonterra did n't answer my Dry Creek inquiry right away , I considered switching the subject to lunch , but it did n't seem appropriate , even if it was one-thirty in the afternoon , and we had n't eaten since before we left his place in Scottsdale that morning . Still musing , Sonterra opened the passenger door for me and waited until I was settled . His handsome features were set , his jawline hard . " Another couple of months , " he reflected , " and he would have been legal . He knew all about coyotes . Why get involved with them again ? " I snapped my seat belt on . Youth is not noted for its patience , and Jimmy Ruiz had been very young . In Mexico , he 'd worn discarded clothes and eaten other people 's garbage . In the U.S. , he 'd tasted Big Macs and stepped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not your fault , " I told Sonterra , because I knew that was what he was thinking  --  that if he 'd done things differently , Jimmy would be alive . Given the singular dangers and depressing nature of Sonterra 's work , I thought he was being a little hard on himself . Sonterra rounded the vehicle , got behind the wheel , cranked on the ignition . Warm air blew from the dashboard , and I felt sweat drying between my breasts and shoulder blades . His right temple pulsed , and he would n't look at me . " Damn it , " he rasped . " Jimmy was so bright . He could have had a good life . Contributed something . " I reached out , touched his arm . " Let it go . You ca n't save them all , Sonterra . " " I was n't trying to save everybody in the world , " he retorted , backing out of a parking space marked VISITORS . " I was trying to save Jimmy . One kid . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make speeches  --  I knew something about the savior complex myself . After inheriting a shitload of money from the father I never knew , I 'd hung out my shingle in the worst part of Phoenix , unofficially adopted one of my first clients , a beautiful young black woman named Shanda Rawlings , given her a job in my storefront office , helped her beat a bad-check rap , and bought her a secondhand car . In a few days , she 'd be entering Gateway Community College as a part-time student , financed by a combination of loans and grants . Like any good messiah , I 'd offered to pay her tuition fees and provide the books , but she 'd refused . Shanda had a lot of pride . She really wanted to build a life for herself and her little girl , Maya , and she had the guts and brains to make it happen . I could n't help imagining how I 'd feel if she 'd been in Jimmy 's place , and the image made me shudder . Sonterra pulled into traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he repeated , as the morgue and county hospital fell away behind us . " I 'm sorry , " I said . The pit of my stomach quivered with a combination of dread and hunger . When Jimmy was found two days before with four other murder victims , facedown in a gulley outside of Dry Creek , with his hands taped behind him and most of his head blown away , the cops had checked his pockets and found Sonterra 's card . They 'd called him to make an ID , which was why we were in Tucson that burnished January afternoon . I 'd had Shanda reschedule all two of my appointments and insisted on coming along to provide moral support . I was n't much help , it seemed to me . Sonterra 's cell phone chirped ; he pulled it from his belt , checked the screen , and pressed the talk button with his thumb . " Hi , Dad , " he said , weaving through light traffic . Pause . " Yeah . It was Jimmy , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , " They 'll probably donate the remains to the med school . " I cringed . True , science needs bodies . But it 's a gruesome concept when the one in question belongs to someone you knew . " I 'll see what I can do , " Sonterra went on , after another interval of attentive silence . " You 're sure that 's what you want ? " I adjusted the air-conditioning . Waited . I hate waiting . " All right , " Sonterra said finally . " Yeah  --  Clare 's with me . Hold on . " He extended the phone , keeping his gaze on the road , and I took it . It lifted my spirits just to hear Alex Sonterra 's voice . In fact , I felt a welcome , warming rush of affection , a thawing of the marrow-freeze I 'd picked up in the morgue . Like I said , I would n't have known my own father if I 'd met him on the street , and Alex seemed a willing substitute . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed over me , and tears stung my eyes . I sucked it up , because I did n't know how to do anything else . " Yes , " I replied . And it was true . I 'm nothing if not resilient . Sure , I was stricken over Jimmy 's death , but the nausea , a combination of morning sickness and normal revulsion , had passed , and I was thinking about food . " You keep an eye on Tonio . Make him eat something . " Alex let out a long breath . " He 's taking this personally . " I nodded , even though Alex could n't see me . " I know , " I said , glancing at Sonterra . " I 'll force-feed him if I have to . " Alex chuckled . " Good , " he replied . We said our fare-thee-wells and disconnected . I handed the cell back to Sonterra . " Dad wants to bury Jimmy up in Phoenix , " he said . " Catholic funeral . Family plot . The whole thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side of the street ; he flipped on his signal and turned into the restaurant 's lot  --  bless him . He 'd gotten the food reference , then . And he 'd probably heard my stomach growling . " That 'll require some paperwork , " I replied . I was n't sure , since I did n't handle immigration cases , but I figured it was safe to assume that the federal , state , and county governments would all want a bureaucratic say in the matter . " I know a lawyer , " Sonterra said , and managed a semblance of a grin . He rarely mentioned my hard-won career , at least in a positive way . He busted the perps , and as a defense attorney , I did my best to get them off . This did not make for domestic tranquillity . We got out of the rig , and he locked it up again . Inside the restaurant , I made my way through the gift shop , heading for the restroom , while Sonterra approached the hostess for a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and he cut the call suspiciously short . My antennae twitched . " Your dad again ? " I asked mildly , when he did n't volunteer anything . It was that cop-lawyer , adversarial thing again . Sonterra and I could blister a mattress , but when it came to just about anything else , we were both pretty careful about showing our cards . Before he gave up an answer , we were seated , with menus in hand . " No , " Sonterra said . Pulling teeth . That was what it was like , getting information out of him . A waitress strolled over , ogling Sonterra the way waitresses almost always did . I ordered a BLT with extra mayo , clam chowder , and a side of sweet potatoes , and Sonterra asked for a burger and fries . " I do n't know how you can eat like that , " he observed , reaching for the little peg-board game the Cracker Barrel provided to keep hungry customers occupied while the cooks worked their magic behind the scenes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moderately affronted tone . " Yeah , " he said , with another sparing grin . " I was there when it went down . " He paused , raised his eyebrows . " So to speak . " Heat flashed through my body . " You were the perpetrator . " He stabbed a green peg into a hole in the game board . " I 'm taking the task-force job , Clare , " he said . My spine straightened like a dancing cobra rising out of a basket . As usual , Sonterra was piping the tune . " That means  --  " " It means a leave of absence from Scottsdale PD , " he interrupted , looking directly into my eyes for the first time since we 'd left the morgue . " It means cleaning out a den of coyotes . " " Noble , but it wo n't bring Jimmy back , " I insisted , thinking of my niece , Emma , my best friends , Loretta Matthews and Mrs. Kravinsky , and my practice . If Sonterra moved to Dry Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have to make a drastic choice . Go with him , or stay . " No , " Sonterra agreed , and waited out the food-service professional when she returned with our iced teas , lingered a little too long , and finally left . " Jimmy 's gone . But I might be able to keep this from happening to somebody else . " " Get real , Sonterra , " I replied , though not unkindly . I knew he was hurting , and I cared . Four months ago , he 'd asked me to marry him  --  before he knew I was carrying his baby  --  and I 'd said yes . I was wearing his late mother 's diamond ring on my left hand . Damn straight I cared , even if I had been dragging my feet a little about setting an actual date to walk down the aisle . " These guys are like mushroom spores . Coyotes , I mean . Pull one up by the roots , and a hundred more spring out of the manure overnight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , well then , " he said . " Let 's just roll over and let them keep right on killing people ! " Two elderly couples , obviously tourists , eyed us warily from the next table . I half expected them to jump up in unison , make a dash for the old Winnebago , and lay rubber out of there . " You 've got to choose your battles , " I argued , in a whisper , and slurped up some iced tea . I guess I thought that would make us seem more normal . Oh , that 's all right then , I imagined the retirees thinking to themselves . They 're talking about murder , but they 're drinking iced tea , so they must be all right . " Yeah , " Sonterra agreed tersely , " and it would be nice if half of those battles were n't with you ! " I leaned in a little . " Pull in your horns , Sonterra . I 'm on your side . " " Prove it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that the Winnebago crowd had lost interest in our little drama . " Oh , " I said , keeping my voice down anyway , " now we get to the old **40;1676;TOOLONG routine ? " Sonterra stuck another peg in the board , hard . " Call it whatever you want , " he shot back . " You 'll put your own spin on anything I say , anyway . " I puffed out a breath and sat back in my chair . The waitress brought our food on a tray , giving me a moderately censorious glance as she set the chowder , sweet potatoes , and BLT down in front of me . Sonterra got a sympathetic sigh along with his lunch . Bitch , I thought , without much rancor . If I actively hated every woman who felt sorry for Sonterra because he 'd hooked up with me , I 'd be one big ulcer by now . Besides , I was more interested in the sweet potatoes . " Are you coming with me or not ? " Sonterra asked , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I could have pretended I thought he was talking about the ride back to Scottsdale , but it would have been bullshit . " What would I do in Dry Creek ? " " Relax a little , maybe . You 're expecting a baby , remember ? " My temper flared . Sonterra wanted me to veg . Hang out at home , watch daytime TV . Knit booties . Sounded like a prescription for brain rot to me . " Barefoot and pregnant , " I said , aggrieved . Sonterra swore under his breath . I lost interest in the sweet potatoes . Then and there , I decided that , if I did go to Dry Creek with Sonterra , I would either start another law office or find myself a job in Tucson . The Winnebago people pushed back their chairs and stood up to leave , chatting amiably about the next destination . Sedona or Santa Fe ? Decisions , decisions . I watched as one of the men dropped a few dollar bills in the middle of the table for a tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest behind her old-fashioned glasses , and for a moment , I thought she was about to ask if I 'd accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior . She laid a hand on my shoulder . " He looks like a very nice , steady young man , " she said , referring , I assumed , to Sonterra , and not Jesus . " Give him a chance . " With that , she trundled away after the other members of her group . Sonterra chuckled . " Good advice , " he said , looking bleakly smug . " Shut up , " I replied , but I could n't help grinning . His cell phone blipped . He sighed , checked the caller ID , and frowned . " Sonterra , " he said . I watched his face change . Dark clouds gathering over an uneasy sea . A little trill of fear shimmied up my windpipe . " What ? " I mouthed . Sonterra shook his head , listening intently . Finally , he said , " I 'm in Tucson . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone , he signaled the waitress for the check . Clearly , lunch was over . " Tell him to hold on . " He waited . " I do n't care if he 's unconscious . Tell him anyway . " Continues ...
