A classic flavoring perks up contemporary recipes // If you 've ever ordered a steaming bowl of savory miso soup , then you 're familiar with the rich , complex flavor a spoonful of miso paste can lend to a simple liquid . But to the Japanese , miso is so much more than just a soup seasoning . " In Japan , miso is the ultimate comfort food , " says Eric Gower , author of The Breakaway Japanese Kitchen . It is also the ultimate cultural food . " Written references to miso date back to the ninth century , and the soy-based condiment we know today is the result of many generations of inspired craftsmanship in Japan , " says Christian Elwell , founder of South River Miso in Conway , MA . Just as France has a long tradition of cheese making , Japan boasts a heritage of artisanal miso making , a tradition that is still going strong . It 's personal too . Individuals put up batches of homemade miso and pride themselves on their recipes in much the same way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans reach for a jolt of Java to get going at the start of the day , for traditional Japanese , no morning would be complete without a bowl of fortifying miso soup . slurp WHIP UP A BOWL OF MISO SOUP : STIR 2 TSP . MISO PASTE INTO 1 CUP HOT VEGETABLE BROTH Photograph // Talk about your breakfast of champions ! A single tablespoon of miso-roughly the amount used in a bowl of soup-has just 35 calories and contains two grams of protein , plus a host of enzymes thought to fortify the immune system and aid digestion . In a study published in the June 2003 issue of Journal of the National Cancer Institute , scientists from Stanford University revealed that women who ate three bowls of miso soup a day had a reduced risk of breast cancer . " As a natural immune enhancer and overall health strengthener , miso ranks way up there , " raves Elwell . FLAVOR BOOST But what exactly is this miracle paste that has such a particular taste that even experts such as Gower and Elwell are hard-pressed to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been called rich , robust , full-bodied , earthy , tangy , beany , nutty , buttery , mushroom-y , meat-like , Parmesan-like and , of course , salty ! ) Miso is a mixture of cooked soybeans , steamed rice ( or wheat or barley ) and salt that has been injected with a mold culture to induce fermentation . Elwell likens the process to adding a sourdough starter to bread dough to make it rise . Once made , miso is sealed in cedar tubs and allowed to age and ferment anywhere from a few weeks to several years . " Miso varieties can be broken down into three basic types : white , yellow and red , which are determined by the ratio of beans to grains and how long the mixture ferments , " explains Gower . White miso , with the highest ratio of grains to soybeans and the shortest fermentation period , is the sweetest and mildest . Red miso has more soybeans , more salt , a longer fermentation period and a full-bodied flavor . Yellow miso falls between the two . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves in the United States and the type that so many Japanese consume each morning . Thanks to its growing availability , miso is making the leap out of the soup bowl and into mainstream Western dishes . A teaspoon or so adds vim to vinaigrettes and gives marinades robust flavor . A dollop can infuse tomato sauce with a hearty tang . And miso makes a fabulous " secret " ingredient when you want to add body to onion soup , chill or barbecue sauce . When it comes to marrying miso with other flavors , Gower recommends pairing it with citrus . " Just combine the zest and juice of a lemon with miso to get a thin sauce that 's fantastic on vegetables and broiled tofu , " he says . Perhaps the best thing about miso ? Simply making room for one little tub in the fridge ( it keeps for at least a year ! ) means that comforting soups , kicked-up kitchen standards and creative new dishes are just a spoonful away . recipe HOT SPRING VEGETABLE SALAD WITH MISO VINAIGRETTE Adapted from The Breakaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes or fewer Serve as a side dish with a hearty casserole , or spoon it over rice for an entre . 1 Tbs. miso paste 2 Tbs. fresh lemon juice 1 tsp. lemon zest 2 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. olive oil 1 tsp. apricot jam tsp. freshly ground black pepper 2 small zucchini , quartered and cut into - inch pieces lb. fresh green beans , trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces 2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels 1 .
