<p> Two years ago , the North Shore Mustangs put the finishing touches on a perfect 15-0 season by defeating The Woodlands 23-7 in the Class 5A Division I state championship game . <p> The win not only was the crowning achievement in a storybook season , but it solidified the Mustangs as one of the premier football programs in the state of Texas . <p> Today , that reputation just keeps growing . The Mustangs have won 50 straight regular-season and 36 straight District 23-5A games . North Shore has compiled five straight 10-0 seasons and has not lost a regular-season game this century . <p> More than players <p> " I think it is a testament to the entire program , " said North Shore head coach David Aymond , who led his team to yet another 10-0 season with last week 's 49-0 victory over Pasadena Memorial . " Our players , our coaches , the people who support us , the administration , the athletic director all make it possible . Everyone is working for a common goal . " <p> And this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state championship . <p> North Shore will start what it hopes is a five-week run to the finals when it hosts Pearland in a Region III-5A bi-district playoff game at 7 p.m . Friday at Galena Park ISD Stadium . Pearland also comes into the game 10-0 . <p> " We have played them three times in the playoffs and been fortunate enough to win all three games , " Aymond said , " but they always have a good football team . We ca n't afford to look past anybody . " <p> Showdown looms <p> But one could hardly blame the Mustangs if they were peeking ahead just a tad . If North Shore wins , it likely will earn a second-round date against the area 's top-ranked team , the Westfield Mustangs . Westfield knocked off North Shore 56-14 in the second round of the playoffs a year ago . <p> " After last year , we would really love to play them again , " admitted Aymond . " We had a bad ballgame against a good football team . Our kids look forward to playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rematch . There is a lot of pride in both programs . But to do that , we must win . I feel like they will win ( their bi-district game against Lamar ) . " <p> If both teams take care of business , North Shore may have the advantage in a meeting with Westfield . To be more specific , a home-field advantage . After the teams met at Leonard George Stadium last season , home of Westfield , the game would be at Galena Park ISD Stadium this season . <p> Home sweet home <p> " They have to reciprocate back to us , " said Aymond of playing at Galena Park ISD Stadium . " But we have to take care of our business against Pearland first before we can worry about any of that . " <p> Aymond said Westfield is deserving of its No. 1 area and No. 2 state ranking . <p> North Shore , meanwhile , enters the playoffs ranked No. 4 in the area and among the top 15 teams in the state of Texas . Aymond sounded comfortable that his Mustangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They are ranked above us in every poll , " Aymond said . " They are ranked either first or second in every poll . I would think that would make them the favorite in this region . " <p> Part of the reason North Shore is not ranked higher is because of the district it plays in . <p> Dogged district <p> District 23-5A is not regarded as one of the tougher leagues in the state despite impressive seasons from Dobie ( 8-2 ) , La Porte ( 9-1 ) and Deer Park ( 7-3 ) . <p> " No matter what district you play in , you are going to play good people and not-so-good people , " Aymond said . " But I think La Porte is a good team , Dobie is a good team and Deer Park is a good team . Heck , Pasadena Memorial also has a good team . They put a lot of points on the board . <p> " When they played us , we were fortunate to have sort of a lopsided win , " said Aymond , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all four teams . " But all four of those teams won their share of games outside of our district . " <p> Dobie finished in a three-way tie for second with Deer Park and La Porte at 5-2 in league play , but missed the playoffs because of a point-spread tie-breaker . <p> " We have played good teams in district and good teams ( Elsik , Hastings and The Woodlands ) outside of district , but I do n't care who you are playing , " said Aymond . " When you put together this kind of streak , that is phenomenal . " <p> Only test <p> North Shore 's closest game this year was a 7-6 victory over The Woodlands , which is ranked No. 6 in the area . <p> " It was a football game where we were inside their 2-yard-line four times and only scored once , " Aymond said . " We had some breakdowns offensively . We did n't take care of the football in the open field . But they have a good defense . They played very well that game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want games to be tough , and you want to win . You look around the other districts and several teams had close games and teams where they beat ( them ) pretty badly . Pearland has done it , Lamar has done it , Westfield has done it . We are really no different . " <p> Aymond said Region III-5A is the only region where four 10-0 teams will meet in the first round . <p> " If you go back , we have played quite a few undefeated teams in the past ( in the playoffs ) , " Aymond said . " We have been fortunate to rise to the occasion . And now we are going to have to do it again . <p> " But next year , when they advance four teams to the playoffs ( out of each district ) , the fourth team will create the chance of playing a lesser team in the first round . I do n't know if many No. 4 teams will have the ability to knock off No. 1 's . But we are n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what is going on this year . " <p> Fast Riser <p> Offensively , North Shore is led by blue-chip wide receiver Chris Riser , who entered the final game of the season with 40 catches for 634 yards . <p> " He is a great player , " Aymond said of Riser . " He is not very tall , maybe 5-(foot)-8 or 5-9 , but he has great moves when he gets the ball . He can run away from you . He is very acrobatic and athletic . He loves to make the big play . He also is an outstanding return guy on punts and kickoffs . " <p> Quarterback Terrance Cain has completed better than 68 percent of his passes for more than 1,150 yards . <p> " He has had a great year , " Aymond said . " He completed almost 70 percent of his passes . " <p> Chris Gainous also finished the season with 1,082 yards rushing on only 88 carries . He averaged 12.3 yards every time he touched the football . <p> Allen Sims , who is just back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of time , while sophomore Matthew Tolbert has also been a factor on the ground . <p> " Whether they are running with the first group or the second group , they are all very talented , " Aymond said . <p> Defense wins crowns <p> Aymond said his team is built on defense . The Mustangs have not allowed more than two touchdowns in a game all year . <p> " We built our program around defense 12 years ago , " he said . " On defense , you have to be physical and speed is a great asset . We want kids who are n't afraid to hit and who can really run . " <p> So , what is the key to winning in the playoffs ? <p> " We have to continue to get better every week , " Aymond said . " We have challenged our players to play better than they did the week before . We want to continue to improve . The playoffs are a real test . The finality of the playoffs is what makes it fun . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have to improve in every facet of game and continue to improve . In other words , we have to generate turnovers on defense and do n't turn the ball over on offense . " <p> Can this team be as good as the 2003 club ? <p> " That was a special bunch , " Aymond said , " but there will always be that incentive there . All our football teams now want to strive to be as good as that team . " <p> ... <p> REGION III-5A PLAYOFFS <p> Who : North Shore vs .
