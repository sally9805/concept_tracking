It was a boom year for America . That means lots of people were buying lots of expensive stuff they did n't really need . In other words , it was a bumper year for gadgets . If it was n't electronic , we made it electronic . If it was already electronic , we combined it with something else electronic , made it smaller and taught it how to play Edelweiss . And somewhere in there we managed to build technologies that will change the way we live , work and relate to one another . It was a great year to be a geek . <P> 1 WWW.NAPSTER.COM Any song . Any time . Free . That 's the beauty of Napster , the simple computer program written by college dropout Shawn Fanning that sparked a global frenzy of music sharing . With its 38 million converts , even Metallica and its legions of lawyers wo n't get this genie back into its bottle . <P> 2 NIKON COOLPIX990 Digital photography finally became cheap enough , easy enough and good enough for the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those on film , and its preview function  --  you can erase the flops  --  does film one better .

Kind of like real life . <P> 4 THE HUNGER SITE It 's as simple as this : every time you click on the Hunger Site 's home page
