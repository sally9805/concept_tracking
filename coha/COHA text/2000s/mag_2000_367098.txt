Felipe , 23 , a construction worker , says he did n't know any better when he and a buddy cruised down the streets of Edwards , Colo. , in their Chevy Blazer last month , swilling Tecate beer and blasting disco music through the late-night stillness . " Hey , we do that all the time back home in Mexico , " Felipe says , shrugging . But the cops in Edwards nailed him for driving under the influence and disturbing the peace . Now , facing an additional felony charge of giving a false name , " Juan Romero , " Felipe has agreed to an unusual penance . In exchange for a softer sentence , he is attending a three-hour crash course on the legal and cultural do 's and don'ts of life in the U.S. <P> The laborer and two dozen other guys in work shirts and battered jeans are gathered in the basement of Eagle County 's government building , hard by the vacation resorts of Vail , Beaver Creek and Copper Mountain . They 're listening to instructor Gustavo Heredia explain bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd are recent arrivals from Mexico . None can speak English . And all are in trouble for such offenses as drunk driving , driving without insurance , spousal abuse and fighting . Four-fifths of them are in the U.S. illegally , but deportation is no big worry in the Colorado resort country , where unemployment has been running under 2% . Here , Latinos hold about half of the low-wage jobs  --  dishwashers , chambermaids and gardeners  --  that are essential to the tourist economy but that few U.S. citizens will take . <P> " Can anyone tell me the phone number for 911 in Mexico ? " Heredia asks . The question draws chuckles . " We do n't have a 911 there , " a beefy youth in a Raiders cap shoots back . " In the U.S. , " Heredia says , " you do n't have to break up a fight . The police will do it for you . " He explains that " the system here is like a card game . You 've got to know the rules to win . " Javier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned the hard way . He paid a $450 fine  --  about a week 's wages  --  after he was pulled over for having a broken windshield . Then the Chihuahua native was charged with driving while impaired , although he insists he had only one beer . <P> For Omar Amaya , 22 , a house painter in Vail , the tougher law enforcement is a modest price to pay for living where he can make $104 a day , compared to $5 a day back in Mexico . He paid a $700 fine after he ignored an earlier warrant and was picked up again for driving without a license or insurance . " Back home , " he says , " I would have settled with the police on the street for $10 . " Says Heredia , a onetime Aspen dishwasher who now works as a court interpreter : " It 's a shock to come from the worst poverty into the richest country with no guidance . " His two-year-old How to Live in America program is a formal part of the courts ' sentencing process in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , " says Judge Terri Diem of Eagle County , where DUI cases have dropped 40% among Hispanics since 1998 . <P> When Heredia 's class moves to customs and etiquette , interest heightens . " Culture is so different here , " Heredia explains , ticking off taboos . " Keep the radios down after 10 p.m . Watch your language in the park on Sundays . Do n't follow a girl down the block  --  she might have you arrested for stalking . " Says Enrique Arvizu , 24 , a Vail laundry worker : " All these things are new to me. "
