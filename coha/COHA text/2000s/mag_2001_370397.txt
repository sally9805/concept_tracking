Tourism is the Rodney Dangerfield of the global economy , the business that never gets respect . It drives economic development in ways that make it more important than the ballyhooed industries of the information revolution . Yet you could go to a score of conferences on international commerce without ever hearing tourism discussed . <P> One reason , I think , is guilt . About 11 million Americans will travel abroad this summer  --  80% of them as tourists . And such hordes can quickly ruin the very places they love . That 's why environmental groups were so quick to criticize plans recently announced by the Mexican government to develop Baja California 's unspoiled eastern coast . Those who remember a charming locale before the tourists arrived understandably sigh for the past . I have just returned from a week visiting friends in Crete , where a mountain gorge that I first hiked in solitary silence in 1973 now sees 260,000 visitors a year . <P> Still , tourism is one of the best motors of economic development for poor countries . The industry is astonishingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind the beach umbrellas . And those jobs do n't require much education . Moreover , tourism offers a cheap crash course in entrepreneurship . The farmer with a few spare rooms can rent them out without committing vast sums of capital . The cafe owner can alter his menu to attract new customers , which is why you can now get a Full English Breakfast anywhere in the world ( though this may not be a good thing ) . The local mechanic can rent out a few scooters and , if that goes well , seek a franchise from Avis . These undertakings develop the habits of risk taking without which no economy can grow to its potential . <P> Tourism offers a better life not just for those who make money from it but also for those who pay to enjoy it . A few steps from my friends ' garden in Crete are cheap hotels that cater to Russians and eastern Europeans who , just the day before yesterday , could only dream of the Aegean sun . Rich Americans , too , have their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . Tourism is like trade : it improves an economy 's competitiveness . Trade does so because it stimulates local suppliers to match the quality and variety of imported goods . Tourism does so because returning travelers demand the goods and services they have seen in foreign countries . Near my office in New York City , a branch of Pier 1 Imports looks like a cross between a yard sale and the great house of a rubber plantation in Southeast Asia . You can buy everything from Filipino and Indonesian cabinets to a Kyoto dining room and a Jamaican bedroom . ( Jamaica as a source of fashionable bedroom furniture  --  who knew ? )
