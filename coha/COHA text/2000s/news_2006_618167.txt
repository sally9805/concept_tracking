<p> What kind of royal treatment can be had at Medieval Times ? And for how much ? Read on milords and ladies . <p> Q : How authentic is it ? <p> A : At Medieval Times , performers and staff go to great lengths to create an atmosphere that takes customers back to a different time and place . While some features are admittedly present day  --  Pepsi was not the drink of choice of medieval kings  --  many details ring true . The Andalusian horses , for instance , share lineage with Spanish war horses from centuries ago . <p> We asked two medieval history experts , Wofford College professor Timothy Schmitz and University of Rochester professor Richard Kaeuper , to separate fact from fiction . <p> Q : Were there actual jousting tournaments ? <p> A : Schmitz says festivals and tournaments took place in the Medieval era . Jousting in tournaments became popular in the 13th century at the end of the Middle Ages . Tournaments of the 11th century often featured what was called a " melee "  --  an every-man-for-himself battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to celebrate weddings or military victories , as is the setting for the Medieval Times show . <p> Q : Would the tournaments have looked like the ones at Medieval Times ? <p> A : Yes . The different games that the knights perform  --  trying to pierce small rings with their lances while on horseback , for instance  --  are authentic . They also fought with swords . Schmitz noted that in actual tournaments , " lots of people get hurt in these things , which is probably something that would n't happen at the restaurant . " <p> Q : Was the medieval culture in Spain , where the Medieval Times tournament is set , similar to England or France ? <p> A : Not quite . Islam spread into Spain in 711 and dominated culture into the 12th and 13th centuries , Schmitz said . That influenced dress , diet and language . <p> Q : Would they have been served by serfs and wenches ? <p> A : No . " That 's kind of make-believe Middle Ages , " Kaeuper said . Servers at banquets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even holding positions of honor , Kaeuper said . Often , the servants were training to be knights . <p> Q : What were the serfs doing ? <p> A : Serfs , said Schmitz , " would have been doing something that was tied to the land . " He is n't sure about wenches . " The idea of this sort of bawdy woman plays to our romantic ideas of what the Middle Ages were like , " he said . <p> Q : Would a dinner of soup , chicken , pork , bread and a potato have been possible ? <p> A : Yes , except hold the potato . Potatoes were not grown in Europe until the 16th century , when they were brought back from the Andes , Schmitz said . Customers should be grateful it is n't completely authentic . Meat was usually boiled . <p> Q : Did they eat with their hands ? <p> A : Yes , people did eat with their hands . But Kaeuper said it was a little more " delicate " than at the restaurant , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite-sized portions , making eating a little more refined . <p> Q : Did they drink coffee ? <p> A : Medieval Times diners are offered java at the end of the show , but they would n't have been afforded such a luxury nine centuries ago . Coffee had not yet reached Europe . <p> Q : Did guests have to pay almost $50 to get in ? <p> A : Nope . " The whole point of a banquet is largesse , " Kaeuper said . " You never sold this stuff . One of the great chivalric qualities is giving . " <p> Q : Did knights have long hair ? <p> A : As in current times , it depended on the region and fashion of the day . For instance , the Anglo-Saxons had long hair , Kaeuper said , while the Normans had buzz cuts . <p> HOW MUCH DOES IT COST ? <p> * Admission : For one adult , the cost of admission at Medieval Times is about the cost of a full tank of premium gasoline  --  $47.95 . Bring along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add to that $35.95  --  the equivalent of a full tank of medium grade . But if you bring in a child who is 3 years old or younger , compare that to the cost of riding your bicycle  --  it 's free . <p> * Paraphernalia : At a baseball game , a pennant will probably cost you about $5-$10 . That 's comparable to the price of a pennant at Medieval Times . For $1 , you get a small one the size of a little girl 's hair ribbon . For $4 , you get a banner the size of a handkerchief to cheer on your knight with . The banners are color-coded to your section . <p> A bat with the Braves logo could cost you from $49 on up to nearly $100 . Depending upon the material , wood or forged steel , a sword at Medieval ranges from $8.95 for a machine-made , wooden one about 3 feet long . Or $325 gets you the Lionheart sword , a hand-made blade forged by craftsmen in Toledo , Spain . <p> Bobbleheads can eat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball game . Figurines of princesses , wizards , and knights on steeds run from $5.95 to $6.95 at the castle . <p> At Turner Field , an authentic Braves cap might be close to $35 . Headgear is pretty popular at Medieval as well , especially with the ladies . Damsel or princess hats , as they are called , are satin and tulle confections that cost $16.95 . So many women wear them at shows it looks like a bachelorette party in there some nights . <p> But here 's some good news for your pocketbook , the first souvenir you get is free  --  a paper crown , not unlike the ones you get a fast-food restaurants . Once again , it 's the color of your knight 's costume . <p> * Suppertime : Admission gets you a four-course meal , garlic bread , vegetable soup , roasted chicken , a rib , a baked potato , dessert and a soda , water or coffee . Medieval is a great , big dinner theater , only here you do n't get utensils to eat your food with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisles hawking soda and beer , the wenches and serfs of the castle walk the arena during the show taking patron orders from the bar outside . The big draw here is a 44-ounce $24 margarita . As grog was to the knights of yore , so tequila is to us . <p> That said , you do n't have to spend that much on a mixed drink , but know that the prices here are like those of a bar at a boutique hotel  --  expensive . For example , a drink in a hurricane-style glass is $14 , and one in a mug the shape of an armored knight 's head is $18 . <p> * Buyer beware : One last note : On the night we were there , there were photographers trolling around offering to take your picture with the princess or king . If you pose for one of those , know that they are n't free and can cost you $20 . <p> CA N'T GET ENOUGH ? <p> Check out more reviews of Medieval Times in the Aug. 17 issue of Access Atlanta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fastest horses ' top speed . <p> 22 : stalls in the stable behind the arena . <p> 500,000 : BTUs in the fireplace in the lobby .
