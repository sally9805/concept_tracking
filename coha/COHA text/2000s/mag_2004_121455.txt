Like Charles Foster Kane and his sled , the athlete who has everything still remembers his favorite Christmas toy . Which is why Tiger Woods , with his Gulfstream V and his $20 million yacht and his Swedish swimsuit-model wife , only ever really longed for Legos . " Space Legos , " specifies Woods . " I was somewhere between five and nine . I got ' em from my mom and dad , but I really had to beg . " // " What was your Rosebud ? " we asked athletes . And they replied with Lincoln Logs , Tonka Toys and an epidemic of G.I. jonesing . For the Bus , it was a bike . " A BMX bike with mag wheels when I was 12 , " says Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis . " I 'll never forget it . I loved that bike . It was under the tree on Christmas morning . I took it out in the snow . " // " A Power Wheels Barbie convertible , " says Seattle Storm guard Sue Bird , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship but finds the Power Wheels jingle truly unforgettable : " Pow-Pow-Power Wheels , now I 'm driving for REAL ! " // When he was eight , Detroit Lions quarterback Joey Harrington awoke to find a new Nintendo system under the tree . " My brother and I played with that for literally 10 hours straight , " he says . " You get up at six in the morning and go downstairs and run and open the Nintendo . ' Let 's go play ! ' Later , at 8 p.m. , our parents set a rule that we could only play an hour a day . But the funny thing is , when we went to bed , we 'd hear the music downstairs from Super Mario Brothers . Then we 'd wake up the next day , and my parents were like , ' We got to Level Two ! ' " // Some holiday gifts keep on giving , like the goalie pads Santa gave to Martin Brodeur . " At the time , I was crying because I did n't get as many toys as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2004 Vezina Trophy winner . " Looking back , that was the best thing I ever got for Christmas . " // Such sentiments are shared by Lamar Odom , who got a miniature dunking hoop when he was six . " It was a Dr. J Mini Jammer , " says the instantly smitten Los Angeles Lakers forward . " It was meant to be . That 's when I found my love , my lady , my first girlfriend . " // When Phoenix Suns coach Mike D'Antoni was six , he got a new leather basketball . " My dad was a coach , " D'Antoni says . " He probably stole it from his high school . " // Some gifts were re-gifts , like the one Lakers forward Luke Walton ca n't forget no matter how hard he tries . " We got a lot of weird stuff , " says Walton , son of eccentric Hall of Famer Bill Walton . " When you play in the NBA , you get a lot of free stuff , right ? So my dad used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to us . I remember this one time , I had this heavy box . It was sitting under the tree for a while , so I was all excited . I opened it , and it was a big box of PowerBars. " // Some Kanes still have their Rosebuds . " What rocked my world was when I got the new Air Jordans in 1995 , all patent-leather black , " says Washington Wizards guard Gilbert Arenas . " I was 13 . I still have them to this day -- untouched . Size 12 . I have n't worn them yet . They were too pretty to wear . " They remain at his father 's house , still in the box . // And some Rosebuds break your heart . " The first time I really got a gift of any meaning was when I was nine , " says Portland Trail Blazers guard Derek Anderson . " My uncle bought me a set of dress clothes -- slacks , shirt , jacket and shoes . I had never had nice clothes before . I practically wore them out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school a lot , I was so proud . " // " We did n't have much when I was little , " says Vijay Singh . But now that he 's the alltime single-season money winner on the PGA Tour , he collects priceless art -- in a manner of speaking . " The best things I 've ever gotten have been hand-drawn cards from my son , Qass . There 'd be a picture , you know , of a little man who did n't really look like a man , but it did n't matter . What mattered is they were from him . I still have a couple in my carry bag . " // What 's in your emotional carry bag ? " Playskool basketball hoop , " says Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger . " Orange and blue with the white backboard. " // " Big Wheel , " says center Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings . " It was just sitting there under the tree . It was too big to wrap , and it just had a bow on it . I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five . // Ever wish you were five again too ? Or seven ? Right wing Anson Carter wears a real NHL jersey for the Los Angeles Kings , but the sweater that gave him goose bumps was a replica jersey -- number 22 of the New York Islanders -- he got for his seventh Christmas . " To this day , " says Carter , " of all the things I have bought or had given to me , that Mike Bossy jersey is my favorite . " // How can that be ? Easy . Now he plays for a living . But back then he was living for play .
