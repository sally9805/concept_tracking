What will my friends think ? // He 's waiting for the shadows . Darkness will provide the cover he wants . So he waits for the safety of nightfall . He sits near the second-floor window of his house , watching the sunset , waiting for the right time . Waiting . // Tonight Nicodemus goes where no one who knows him would believe . Tomorrow morning he 'll go where everyone expects him to be . He will gather with religious leaders like he does every morning and do what religious leaders do : discuss God . Discuss reaching God , pleasing God , appeasing God . God . // Pharisees talk about God . And Nicodemus sits among them . Debating . Pondering . Solving puzzles about God . // What does God say ? Nicodemus needs to know . It 's his job . He 's a holy man and leads holy men . His name appears on the elite list of Torah scholars . He dedicated his life to the law and occupies one of the seventy-one seats of the Judean supreme court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Justin , 16 // Like Nicodemus , I have lots of questions I 'd like to ask God . For starters : // Who are you ? // Who am I ? // Why was I born now and into this family ? // Why did you go to the trouble to create such a beautiful world ? // Why is there a hell ? // Why do you love me no matter what I do ? // And as long as I 'm asking , would you mind telling me : What is the purpose of snakes , mosquitoes , and fleas ? // Questions for this Galilean preacher . The man who has ample time for the down-and-out crowd but little time for religious leaders . // So Nicodemus comes at night . His friends ca n't know of the meeting . They would n't understand . As the shadows darken the city , Nicodemus steps out , slips unseen through the winding streets . He passes servants lighting lamps in the courtyards and takes a path that ends at the door of a simple house . Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . Nicodemus knocks . // The noisy room silences as Nicodemus enters . The men are wharf workers and tax collectors , unaccustomed to the highbrow world of a scholar . They squirm in their seats . Silence . // Justin , 16 // I understand how Nicodemus felt . I want to know Jesus better too . Sometimes I feel like I 'm the only one . It 's not that my friends hate God or anything . They just do n't seem to care . Nicodemus came to you at night , when he did n't have to face anyone else . Here it is . Night . I 'm alone . // Thinking . Praying . Asking questions . // Wondering who you are and why you made me . Wondering what it takes to know you better . Wondering what you want from me. // The awkward silence ends as Nicodemus begins the most famous conversation in the Bible : " Rabbi , we know that You are a teacher come from God ; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Nicodemus begins with what he " knows . " I 've done my homework , he implies . Your work impresses me. // We wait for Jesus to return the compliment . " And I 've heard of you , Nicodemus. " // None comes . Jesus makes no mention of Nicodemus 's VIP status or good intentions , not because they do n't exist , but because , according to Jesus , they just do n't matter . He simply issues this proclamation : " Unless one is born again , he can not see the kingdom of God " ( 3:3 NKJV ) . // Behold the Continental Divide of Scripture , the International Date Line of faith . Nicodemus stands on one side , Jesus on the other , and Christ pulls no punches about their differences . // Nicodemus lives in a land of good efforts , sincere gestures , and hard work . Give God your best and God does the rest . // Jesus 's response ? Your best wo n't do . Your works do n't work . Your finest efforts do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even see what God is up to . // Nicodemus hesitates . Born again ? " How can a man be born when he is old ? " ( 3:4 NKJV ) . You must be kidding . Put life in reverse ? Rewind the tape ? Start all over ? We ca n't be born again . // Oh , but would n't we like to ? A do-over . A try-again. // Jesus does n't crack a smile . " Most assuredly , I say to you , unless one is born of water and the Spirit , he can not enter the kingdom of God " ( 3:5 NKJV ) . About this time a gust of wind blows a few leaves through the still-open door . Jesus picks one off the floor and holds it up . God 's power works like that wind , Jesus explains . Newborn hearts are born of heaven . You ca n't wish , earn , or create one . New birth ? Inconceivable . God handles the task , start to finish . // Nicodemus looks around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment . // Born again . Birth , by definition , is a passive act . The child contributes nothing to the delivery . Mom deserves the gold . She exerts the effort . She pushes , agonizes , and delivers . // The mother pays the price of birth . The baby does n't do any of the work . Likewise , a spiritual rebirthing requires a capable parent , not an able infant . // The original creator must do it again . This is the act that Jesus describes . // Born : God exerts the effort . // Again : God restores the beauty . // We do n't try again . We need not the muscle of self but a miracle of God . The thought strikes Nicodemus as insane . " How can this be ? " ( 3:9 ) . Jesus answers by leading him to the Hope diamond of the Bible . // A twenty-six-word parade of hope : beginning with God , ending with life , and urging us to do the same . Brief enough to write on a napkin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand years of storms and questions . If you know nothing of the Bible , start here . If you know everything in the Bible , return here . We all need the reminder . // Becca , 17 // Once I got to pick a plastic toy ring out of a " treasure chest " because I had memorized a Bible verse . I was , like , five or something . I lost that ring by the next morning ... but I still remember the words of the verse by heart . It was John 3:16. // Now I get why kids learn this verse first . It shows what love is all about . Not flowers , chocolate , and the sappy kiss at the end of movies-although I like those sometimes too ! But real love that gave everything , gave his Son . It is a laser pointing to the very heart of God . More than any verse in the Bible , John 3:16 helps me understand who God is and what he has done for me. // The heart of the human problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment is prescribed in John 3:16. // He loves . He gave . We believe . We live . // The words are to Scripture what the Mississippi River is to America-an entryway into the heartland . Believe or dismiss them , embrace or reject them , any serious consideration of Christ must include them . Could you ponder note the word that snatches your attention . " For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . " // " God so loved the world ... " We 'd expect an anger-fueled God . One who punishes the world , recycles the world , forsakes the world , ... but loves the world ? // The world ? This world ? With all the horrible things that go on-child abuse , hunger , poverty , war ... ? And God loves the world so much he gave his : // Rules ? // Dicta ? // Edicts ? // No . The heart-stilling , mind-bending , deal-making-or-breaking claim of John 3:16 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scripture equates Jesus with God . God , then , gave himself . Why ? So that " whoever believes in him shall not perish . " // Whoever ... a universal word . // And perish ... a sobering word . We 'd like to dilute , if not delete , the term . Not Jesus . He pounds Do Not Enter signs on every square inch of Satan 's gate and tells those hell-bent on entering to do so over his dead body . Even so , some souls insist . // In the end , some perish and some live . And what determines the difference ? Not talents or what you do , not who you are or your possessions . Nicodemus had all of these . The difference is determined by our belief . " Whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . " // Becca , 17 // Nicodemus did what he thought was right . I mean , he was a religious leader . He did spend his days talking about God and reading scriptures . In comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . // Sometimes it seems like my life is spent on trying to make the world happy . My teachers , parents , friends ... youth leaders . Compared to the world , face it , I am a really good person . Compared to most of the girls at my high school , I 'd get the gold star . What is that goofy saying my dad would tell my brother and me : " Do n't drink or smoke or chew and do n't go with girls who do " ? Well , I do n't drink or smoke or cheat or lie ( much ) . I got ta keep telling myself I 'm missing the point , and I can never do or be good enough .... I mean , my good grades or perfect driving record or youth group car wash wo n't get me into heaven . // But I 'd be lying if I said I spend tons of time thinking about meeting God 's standards . It 's easier to compare myself to others . Nobody 's perfect , and some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that the " whoever " in that verse is me . My name . My life . Sin is sin . Dark hearts compared to dark hearts still separate me from you . That 's where you come in , Jesus . Here you go . I 'll take you up on that do-over. // THINK IT OVER // Have you ever hidden your search for God from friends ? If so , why ? // For you , what 's the hardest thing about God 's character to understand ? // In what ways do you want to be like God ? //
