When baby Sara Quirtle laughed for the first time , the laugh burbled out of her and flitted through her window . It slid down the side of her house and pranced along her quiet lane . It took a right on Water Street , and frolicked on to the wide sea that separated the mainland from Never Land . There the laugh set out , skipping from the tip-top of one wave to the tip-top of the next . But after two weeks of dancing over the ocean , the laugh veered too far to the south . It would have missed the island entirely if Never Land had n't moved south , too . The island was looking for the laugh . The fact is , you ca n't find Never Land if it does n't want you , and if it does want you , you ca n't miss it . The island is an odd place . The humans ( or Clumsies , as the fairies call them ) and the animals who live there never grow old . Never . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island rides the waves is because Clumsy children believe in it . If a time ever comes when they all lose faith , Never Land will lift up and fly away . Even now , if a single Clumsy child stops believing in fairies , a Never fairy dies  --  unless enough Clumsy children clap to show that they believe . Sometimes the island is huge , and sometimes it 's small . Its inhabitants mostly live near the shore . The forests and the plains and Torth Mountain , where the dragon Kyto is imprisoned , are largely unexplored . As soon as the island moved , Mother Dove knew a laugh was on its way . High time , she thought . She felt lucky whenever a new arrival was coming . And the fairies would be jubilant . She told Beck , the finest animal-talent fairy in Never Land . Beck told her friend Moth , who could light the entire Home Tree with her glow . Moth told Tinker Bell and eight other fairies . You see , when a baby laughs for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns into a mainland fairy  --  a Great Wanded fairy or a Lesser Wanded fairy or a Spell-Casting fairy or a Giant Shimmering fairy . Occasionally it turns into a Never fairy . Word spread to all the talents . Each one wanted the new fairy , and each one made an extra effort to deserve her . The keyhole-design-talent fairies whipped up a dozen fresh designs . The caterpillar-herders found a caterpillar that had been missing for a week . And the music-talent fairies , who had just lost a fairy to disbelief , practiced an extra hour every day . Approaching the island , the laugh slipped under a mermaid 's rainbow . It breezed by the pirate ship in Pirate Cove , too silly to be scared . When it touched shore , it sped up and hurtled along the beach , not even pausing to admire the flock of giant yellow-shelled tortoises . The laugh shrank and became more concentrated . After it passed the fifty-fourth conch shell , it canted inland . It had n't gone far , however , before the air hardened against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl . The trouble was that Never Land was having doubts . This laugh was a little different , and the island was n't sure whether to let it in . Below lay Fairy Haven . Fairies were flying in and out of their rooms in the Home Tree , a towering maple that is the heart of Fairy Haven . Fairies were washing windows , taking in laundry , watering windowsill flowerpots  --  making everything shipshape in honor of the evening 's celebration of the Molt . The laugh sensed it belonged down there . It tried to descend , but it could n't . In the lower stories of the Home Tree , fairies were busy in their workshops . Two sewing-talent fairies were rushing to finish an iris-petal gown . Bess , the island 's foremost artist , was putting the finishing touches on a portrait of Mother Dove . If Bess  --  or any of the others-had known the laugh was overhead , she 'd have flown out her window and helped it along . She 'd have called more fairies to help too . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vidia , even dignified Queen Clarion . On the tree 's lowest story , fairies bustled about the kitchen , unaware of the laugh . Two cooking-talent fairies hefted a huge roast of mock turtle into the oven . Three sparrow men ( male fairies ) argued over the best way to slice the night 's potato . And a baking-talent fairy consulted with a coiffure-talent fairy over the braiding of the bread . Above , the laugh pushed on , fighting for every inch . It passed above the oak tree that was the Home Tree 's nearest neighbor . The laugh had no idea that a crew of scullery-talent fairies was working under the tree . Protected by nutshell helmets , they were collecting acorns for tonight 's soup . In the barnyard beyond the oak tree , four dairy-talent fairies milked four dairy mice . The fairies failed to see the laugh 's faint shadow as it crossed over each mouse 's back . In the orchard on the other side of Havendish Stream , a squad of fruit-talent fairies picked two dozen cherries for two dozen cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh reached the edge of Fairy Haven where Mother Dove sat , as always , on her egg in the lower branches of a hawthorn tree . The nest was next to the fairy circle , where tonight 's celebration would be held . Did the laugh feel the pull of Mother Dove 's goodness ? I do n't know , but it bunched itself for a final effort . If Mother Dove had n't been distracted , she 'd have felt the laugh . But she was listening as a fairy recited her lines for a skit tonight , and she was watching as another fairy practiced her flying polka . Mother Dove wanted to nod encouragingly to them , but she had to keep her head still so Beck could brush her neck feathers . Overhead , the laugh pushed with all its might . At the same moment , Never Land decided to let it in . It spun once , then zoomed faster and faster , above Mother Dove , back over the orchard , past the mice and the oak tree , on a downward course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knothole door to the Home Tree . And there , in the Tree 's pebbled courtyard , was Prilla , the new fairy , flat on her back , one wing bent , legs in the air , the remnants of the laugh collecting around her to form her Arrival Garment .
