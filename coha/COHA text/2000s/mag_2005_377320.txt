Carly Fiorina may have been the most powerful woman in business , but she did n't see herself that way . " I do n't think of myself , nor do I appreciate being characterized , as a woman CEO , " she told TIME in 2002 . But she was one of just eight female CEOs of a FORTUNE 500 company , and so her performance at HP drew keen attention . As it turns out , Fiorina took the same risks as her male counterparts , made the same mistakes  --  and met the same fate . " This is not about gender . It 's really about business , " says Deborah Soon of Catalyst , a nonprofit group promoting women in business . She points to remarkable progress : Fiorina was far from the only woman at the top of the tech world . Indeed , a major player in her ouster was another prominent woman , Patricia Dunn , who took over as chairwoman . Ann Livermore runs a key division of HP ; Patricia Russo runs Lucent , Fiorina 's old company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible successor to Fiorina . The moral : women have come a long way in business , but they can fall just as far .  --  By Jyoti Thottam . With reporting by Chris Taylor/San Francisco
