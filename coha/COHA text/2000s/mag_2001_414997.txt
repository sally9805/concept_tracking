HANGING IN THE BALANCE // Ive just read the excellent , factual , non-emotional cover story in your November/December 2000 issue ( " Balancing Act : Can America Sustain a Population of 500 Million-or even a Billion-by 2100 ? " ) . There are few publications in the entire U.S. that will take such factual information and run with it , rather than mouth away at " political correctness . " America 's cities and metro areas are already hopeless overstressed with too many people . The immigration apologizers keep pointing at all the open landscape in Utah and Nevada and Nebraska , but how many immigrants-or anybody else  --  have settled in these wide open spaces ? If we do n't get a firm grip on today 's unlimited immigration and bring the annual rate down to 200,000 , we 'll all be doomed to an Orwellian future . Allen Jamieson Sacramento , CA Thank you for your excellent article about human over-population in the U.S. and the immigration factor . Even organizations that I support , such as the Sierra Club and Zero Population Growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between over-immigration to the U.S. and destruction of our natural environment ( as well as other quality-of-life matters ) . I sympathize with people who want to come to the U.S. to improve their life , but the huge numbers in recent years and the fact that immigrants often have very large families means that our policy should be reconsidered to reduce the torrent . I would prefer that the U.S. government help people living in their own country , rather than help them by allowing so many to move here . As a minimum , U.S. foreign policy should change so that we do not support dictators and multinational corporations , which destroy other nations ' environments and repress people in order to maintain the unjust distribution of wealth and power . Linda DeStefano Syracuse , NY I find your editorial comments and the publication of Jim Motavalli 's " Balancing Act " in the November/December 2000 issue very encouraging . My hope is that this will send an urgent message to environmental organizations and to the progressive community in general that it is time for public discussion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks very much for initiating a long overdue discussion . John Simcox Minneapolis , MN Your November/December 2000 cover story about the doubling of the U.S. population perpetuates a few myths : 1 . Everything is all right now . It 's only going to get bad tomorrow ; 2 . Everyone is cruising in the U.S. There are problems only in foreign countries ; 3 . We are n't to blame for what happens in those countries ; 4 . The problems in other countries are n't ours , too ; 5 . If anything goes wrong , the American spirit will prevail . Bonnie KerrPilon Sylvain Pilon , HI Editor 's Note : Actually , we feel we took special care to present the very important reasons relating to poverty , political repression and environmental degradation that cause so many people to emigrate to the U.S. Our lengthy companion article , " Coming to America , " details the many conditions that leave people all over the world with no viable alternative to immigration . The following letter from Zero Population Growth expounds further . Your cover story " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the iceberg tearing at the hull of the Earth 's environmental Titanic . However , your main point about immigration is a bit like asking : Who should be allowed to sit in the best deck chairs while the ship is going down ? Should n't we instead be looking for ways to help everyone on the ship ? Let me be clear : I am completely opposed to explicitly or implicitly blaming immigrants and U.S. immigration policies for our population and environmental woes . Migration occurs for complex social , political , economic and environmental reasons . It should n't be treated as a numbers game . That would make us as bad as those " birth dearth " pundits . A concerted effort to reduce the pressure on people to flee their homelands is a much more realistic and humanitarian approach . This approach should focus on radically increasing U.S. development aid to the world 's poorest countries . At the minute our investment is nowhere near enough to meet local demand for education ( particularly for young women ) , economic development and voluntary family planning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded , more stable and sustainable planet . The truth is : We can plan for the impact of immigration and fertility changes . We can recognize the opportunities that population stabilization is creating . We can meet the challenge of reducing overconsumption and promoting sustainability . We can take advantage of exploding advances in technology and productivity . We can embrace the potential for big quality-of-life improvements for all . Or , we can engage in unnecessary finger-pointing , hand-wringing and unrealistic arguments for a kind of intercontinental migration missile or depopulation bomb . Peter H. Kostmayer President , Zero Population Growth Washington , D.C. Your November/December 2000 cover story and the E Word comments regarding immigration are most welcome . Many sources of information are dominated by other agendas that conflict in some way with the subject of a rational immigration policy . This is why E Magazine is so important : it concentrates on the environment . Undoubtedly there are many " environmentalists " who do not see the impact of too many people as the cause of environmental problems , but at least their concern for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern and point out the destructive role of overpopulation , no matter what the source . Barbara McEwan Forest , VA Thank you so much for courageously speaking the truth in your November/December 2000 cover story . What a relief ! Population growth exists and it is an environmental issue . You said the unspeakable : that legal and illegal immigration is driving the U.S. population to astronomical levels , maybe in excess of a billion people by the end of this century . James G McDonald Arlington , VA I picked up a copy of your November/December 2000 issue and read with interest the comments about immigration . It 's interesting how easy it can be to overlook the obvious , such as the blame placed on immigrants for unemployment while they automatically create jobs by being consumers along with the rest of us . Let 's not forget that if we protect the environment by putting the brakes on immigration , the people kept out will be living elsewhere  --  perhaps forced to choose between protecting the environment and feeding their family . That 's why the Amazon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . If the problem is the per capita environmental impact of the American way of life compared with that of other countries , then it 's important to focus on changing that lifestyle , not keeping immigrants out to make the current American lifestyle seem more feasible . Immigration is not a " divisive " issue within the environmental movement . It is a divisive issue between those who understand what is really creating the problems , and those who are either shortsighted or just using " the environment " as a cover for other agendas . Robert B. Williams , III Scottsdale , AZ There is not much to add except to say " good job . " " I appreciate your speaking out on very important issues , but it begins to look as though we may be too late with too little . We ca n't seem to get politicians and governments involved with these subjects . Yet while more and more speak out , there is still hope . Ralph E. Clark McAllen , TX I appreciate the insightful article on immigration and population growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep up the good work . Tom Sleckman San Francisco , CA OH , CULLIGAN MAN I just read the " Ask E " in the November/December 2000 issue about the gas additive MTBE and water filters . If MTBE ( Methl Tertiary-Butyl Ether ) is in your water supply , a clean glass of drinking water is but a minuscule portion of exposure . Compare that six to eight ounces of water you drink to the gallons washing over your body in the shower . Will somebody please write an article about all the avenues of exposure to the chemical MTBE ? It worries me that so many people will feel secure because it is being filtered from their drinking water , while their skin is absorbing more than could be contained in a glass . I live in a region with the longest , continually MTBE-contaminated municipal water supply in the country . We were lied to for years , and the medical evidence has never been properly investigated . I do not intend to panic people , but a false sense of security is very dangerous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NY Liberty , NY STILL CLIMBING This is in regards to the In Brief " Anchors Away " ( November/December 2000 ) about fixed anchors for climbers in our national parks . Today 's climbers should realize that if they had stuck with classical climbing instead of new-fangled , high-tech mechanical aids there would n't be an anchors problem . Pitons ( not anchors ) were used in the old days , strictly for safety and never for direct support . All pitons must be removed when a climb is completed , and could only be pounded into an existing crack or crevice in the rock , never a drilled hole . To leave a piton behind was one of the cardinal sins of rock-climbing . I shudder at the sight of all the contemporary gadgetry . Yes , anchors should definitely be banned in the wilderness . But then , today 's climbers do n't really go to experience the wilderness anyway . What they do is mainly part of the macho culture of extreme sports . Leaving a bunch of anchors behind would not be perceived by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanalei , HI <p>
