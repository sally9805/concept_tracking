Marty Nothstein is America 's Best  --  Kept Secret for Olympic Cycling Gold // It 's a warm summer night , near Atlanta . Beside a granite dome sticking up amid the lowlands sits an unlikely sight for the football-mad Old South : a velodrome . Not only a velodrome , but one packed to capacity Marty Nothstein  --  the best American cyclist most Americans have never heard of-is getting ready to win an Olympic gold medal in the match sprint . But Germany 's Jens Fiedler , the defending Olympic champion and a strong , wily racer , is in the way . According to the rules of the match sprint , Nothstein must lead the first lap , but on the second he can slow , forcing Fiedler to ride at the front , where there 's no drafting and every pedal stroke could mean a surprise jump from behind.There 's no horsepower involved  --  it 's all tactics and will . As the last lap starts , it 's Fiedler 's game . Nothstein stays up front.The mostly American crowd tenses . The muscles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rides up the track and pins Fiedler against the banking-a tactically perfect move that cuts off the German 's line of attack.The riders slow between the first and second turns . Nothstein 's front wheel twitches slightly as he balances and , momentarily , his head swivels forward to regain his equilibrium . Fiedler pounces . He dives under Nothstein 's bike and down the banking . In 50 yards he accelerates from zero to nearly 40 miles an hour-faster acceleration than most sports cars . The salvation for Nothstein 's tiny , terrible mistake lies in Fiedler 's draft , and now he fights for it , desperately trying to latch onto the German 's rear wheel . His face twists with the effort and both riders ' legs spin into blurs . Rounding turn three , Nothstein is on Fiedler 's wheel and begins to arc up and around.The crowd senses victory and goes mad.The two racers sweep across the line , throwing their bikes forward . After four years as the top sprinter in the world-four years winning world championships that the mainstream American public knows nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By a centimeter . The first thing that strikes you about Martin Wayne Nothstein is just how damn athletic he is . At 6-foot-2 , 205 pounds and less than 5% body fat , with the strong jawline of a classic jock , he looks like a bruising college fullback . Nothstein is one of the world 's ultra  --  elite in a niche of the already niched sport of cycling in America . In addition to three world-championship titles ( includin ' 94 when he was the world champ in both the sprint and keirin ) and four other world medals , Nothstein was the planet 's top-ranked sprinter in ' 96 and ' 97 ( currently he 's seventh ) , owns 19 national championships ( including four straight triple-gold years in sprint , keirin and Olympic Sprint ) , nine World Cup wins and is the current world record holder in the flying 500meter time trial . Translate those performances to other sports and he 's Sammy Sosa or Scottie Pippen.Take it to the road and he 's Lance Armstrong . Nothstein does n't see the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says simply " I 'm training to win a gold medal . " Two , actually . He 's the insider 's favorite to win the sprint and keirin in Sydney-America 's best hope for cycling gold , and its only chance for a double gold on wheels.Armstrong has a shot at the road time trial , but in the road race itself he 'll work for teammate George Hincapie . Mountain biker Alison Dunlap leads this year 's World Cup series , but her best finish at a World Championship race ( like the Olympic race , a one-day , one-time shot ) is fourth . And although off-road studTravis Brown was featured in Rolling Stone 's Olympic preview , Nothstein correctly observes that , " When you think about American cyclists who are going to compete for a medal , Travis Brown is not one of them . " Nothstein is n't malicious ; he just does n't waste much time with pleasantries . His brash ( at times cocky ) demeanor is offset by a disarming , matter-of-fact delivery . And he uses the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so confident at the ' 96 Games he even predicted his victory . " Fiedler will have to have the best day of his life to beat me , " he said after his semifinal victory . Asked now what happened , Nothstein shrugs and says simply , " He did . Jens admitted he had to be Superman to beat me , and he was . But if I 'd had $100,000 that day , I 'd have bet it on me . " A Sports Illustrated reporter closed his notebook as Nothstein crossed the line behind Fiedler . No gold , no story . No mainstream acclaim  --  the American public does n't care about world or national championships . Or silver . The media monster wants gold . Some experts think there 's a good chance America wo n't understand Nothstein 's achievement even if he wins two golds.The match sprint is , after all , only a three-lap event , the first two of which are ridden slowly as riders try to gain position advantages.The tactics can seem byzantine , the event is so short it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't translate well on television . Though he 's largely ignored outside the track world , within it Nothstein is a star-and he 's been compensated like one . " I 've made more than I ever thought possible , " he says . " It 's enough to live comfortably-I 've got a house and land and all the toys I need . " Asked if the money makes the lack of recognition easier to accept , Nothstein acts as if we still do n't understand . " Dollars are just a bonus . I do n't train for Sports Illustrated to do an article on me . I train to walk onto podiums . " Born and raised in Trexlertown , a working-class town in eastern Pennsylvania , Nothstein was a star in baseball and football . The closest he ever got to competitive cycling was BMX racing . When he was 14 , he and his brother Jay got into a rock-throwing contest . " It went from who could throw the farthest to who could throw most accurately  --  who could hit the neighbor 's garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter , a former bike racer and coach.When Nothstein 's mother marched the boys over to apologize , Walter lectured the boys and told them to take their energy to the local velodrome . Marty signed up for theAir Products Developmental Program , a track class for kids sponsored by a local industrial company . He began winning immediately . After the class ended , Nothstein enrolled in the Bicycle Racing League , a high-school league for aspiring trackies.There , Gil Hatton , a coach at the Trexlertown velodrome and a world championship bronze medalist , noticed him . Hatton saw something besides the natural athleticism of the young Nothstein . " What I saw in Marty was that he was pretty arrogant : ' says Hatton . " He talked a lot of smack . It 's in his blood . It 's bred in him . " Under Hatton , Nothstein excelled at bike racing and gave up ball sports . " I said to myself , ' You ca n't win every game even if you give 100 percent cause you 're counting on nine , ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in cycling , you give 100 percent and everything you have and it 's up to you-you can win it all . " Nothstein won just about everything he entered until the ' 91 Pan Am Games . He expected to win the sprint title but got shelled , finishing seventh . " I should have won that race , " Nothstein says . " I should have won that whole damn competition.That put some fire in me and made me decide to train correctly and commit 100 percent , to become the best in the world . " Today , Nothstein does n't have a coach , just what he calls , " a great advisory staff , where I pick and choose the best from each person and do my own thing . " He 's so autonomous that USA Cycling , the governing body of the sport inAmerica and the final arbiter for Olympic team selection , leaves Nothstein alone to do what he does best.This year , he 's skipped most major international competitions ( although he won the sprint at the only World Cup he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feds let me do what I need to do , " he says . " As long as I 'm bringing home medals they 're going to allow me to do what I do . And I 'm not going to let them down . " He 's unconcerned with his lack of international competition this season . " I raced on a 250-meter track in Call and won the Sydney track is a 250  --  meter oval and I raced the Olympic Invitational here at Trexlertown against Darryn Hill and Gary Neiwand , both former world champions and I beat em . I smoked ' em . " But while Nothstein is largely left to his own devices ( " At this point in my career , I know more about this than anyone , " he says ) he relies on Hatton as a no-BS sounding board . Hatton obliges . When asked about Nothstein 's chances in Sydney , Hatton says , " He has n't done much in the past three years-three Pan Am golds . That 's not a big deal . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatton continues : " His World Cup victory in Call proved to a lot of people that he 's back at the level where he can win major international competitions . " It 's a blend of challenge and confirmation that Nothstein thrives on.A racer who 's sure he 's the world 's best but is forced to prove it again and again , Nothstein is only as good as his last race . " I have to constantly re-evaluate my goals , " he says . " If two , three weeks before the Games I 'm not at a gold standard , then maybe I go down there and say Gosh , let 's just win a medal . " ' Nothstein 's tone betrays his true feeling-he 'll be hugely disappointed with anything but gold . Called on it , he laughs and says , " The way I 've been riding , tearing things up , I definitely can win two gold medals . I 'm about winning a gold medal . I want to be able to say that for the rest of my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold medal and still not get it . He 's had four years to analyze that race-what happened and how things went wrong . Given that this year is his best shot at finally getting that gold , you could probably bet $100,000 that he 'll get it . Marty would.Again .
