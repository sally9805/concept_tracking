The Mayor of Central Park Chapter One I Start Telling the Tale Now the way I heard it , this whole loopy story happened in the pearly month of May 1900 , right here in the middle of New York City . It 's mostly about this gray squirrel who went by the name of Oscar Westerwit . To look at Oscar Westerwit you might think , hey , just another New York City squirrel . Only thing is , if you said that , you 'd be dead wrong . ' Cause the simple scoop is that this here Oscar Westerwit was a full-sized uptown romantic . And when you get an uptown squirrel who 's romantic , let me tell you something : You got yourself a story busting to trot itself up Broadway like a tap-dancing centipede . But you 're asking , how come I was able to grab this tale ? Well , back in them days I was cub reporter for the Daily Mirror . My beat was Central Park . So , figures , while I 'm not in the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar Westerwit , this squirrel I 'm talking about , the voters in Central Park used to call him the mayor of Central Park . Which ai n't to say he actually was mayor . At the time , the real mayor of New York was Hiz Honor Robert A. Van Wyck , a guy so terrific they named a traffic jam after him . But the thing of it was , since Oscar knew everybody and everything in the park so well , the voters there called him the mayor . Now to bump right into the beginning , this yarn started spinning string on the third Friday night in May . That was when Oscar held his regular mayor 's monthly open house . Only first you need to fix yourself a picture of Oscar in your head . I mean , this here was one swell-suited squirrel , dressed up to all nine buttons . He was sporting a light , white cotton suit , with a baby blue bow tie , shined-up shoes and spats , and a ripping red gardenia right there on his jacket lapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the park-was just as terrific . There was an easy chair by the window with an actual electric lamp at its side . There was a pile of The Baseball Weekly stacked up along with the New York Tribune . Pictures of his heroes  --  Honus Wagner , Roscoe Conklin , and Lillian Russell  --  were on the walls , right along with his degree from the City University  --  class of 1898 . As for Oscar hisself , he was humming a Broadway show tune and sliding into a tap-dance do-diddle every other step while setting food on the table . You know , like : My sweetheart 's the girl in the moon , I 'm getting to marry her soon . When all of a sudden , who should come bip-bopping into his room ? Sam Peekskill , that 's who . " Hey , Oscar , " the rabbit shouted , the way only an excited southpaw rabbit can volume his voice , " Arty Bigalow has gone missing ! " Now what you got to know is , Oscar was n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also the shortstop and manager of the Central Park Green Sox . And a pretty decent player , too . " Says who ? " said Oscar to Sam . " No one 's seen him since day before the day before . " " I 'm not worried , " said Oscar as he filled a bowl with nuts and crackers and set it by the window . " How come ? " said Sam . " Sam , " said Oscar as he laid out some pretzels and pickles , " no way Arty 's going to miss the game . Hey , if we beat the Wall Street Bulls , we 're in first place . He knows that . I know that . Everyone knows that . Here , pal , spot down these cucumber sandwiches . " " Sure , " said Sam , doing like he was told . " But Oscar , " he said , " this Arty , his personal life is one big spicy meatball . What the guys were thinking was , maybe youse should go check his boardinghouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oscar shook his head and plunked a pile of napkins down like he was flashing a royal flush at a Friday night poker game . " Tonight 's my open house . " " So ? " " Hey , Sam , " said Oscar . " Come over here . " Sam went to where Oscar was standing by the window . " See that moon in the sky ? " said the squirrel . " Sure . It 's where it 's supposed to be , ai n't it ? " " Right . But pop your eyes on how the moonlight makes the park hills , lakes , trees , and meadows look like they 've been dipped deep in blue light and purple shadow . " " Okay . " " And there  --  the Dakota towers are looking like servants on the ready . Now  --  listen to those clip-clopping horses and carriages on Fifth Avenue . And over to the West Side  --  hear them clanging trolley bells . Got all that ? " " What 's all this to do with tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this Central Park is ... perfect . " " Yeah , but if Arty  --  " " Hey , pal , " said Oscar , " Central Park is where I was born , grew up , and live . Central Park is the best beauty in this whole burg . " " Sure , Oscar , but Arty  --  " " Hey , come on . Guys like us have been around here long before 1857 when the park was built ; long before the Dutch showed up in 1612 . Long even before the Lenape Indians named this island Manna-hata . " " Okay , " said Sam . " It 's great to know all that stuff , but if Arty do n't  --  " Oscar spread his forepaws wide . " Hey , I love this place ! " " Oscar , " said Sam , " you know where a romantic like youse belongs ? In a Broadway show , that 's where . " " Broadway Oscar , that 's me ! " And the squirrel did a quick tap-dance double doodle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you 're right about Arty . " Was n't long before the apartment was crowded . Some were there for the nuts , pretzels , and talk Oscar laid out deep . But plenty of folks were there asking for his help ...
