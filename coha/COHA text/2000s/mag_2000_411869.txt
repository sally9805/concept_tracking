Yard artists do n't need your approval but they 's like It . Purveyours of artwork both weird and wonderful , they put joy and themselves into their reations . Photograph Photograph // Benjamin Franklin once wrote , " Beauty and folly are old companions . " Being nearly sauteed by lightning while flying a kite may have inspired this particular thought . Yet it aptly applies to a form of garden decoration called " yard art . " Is yard art silly or is it sublime ? That depends on which side of the fence you happen to be sitting . The artists in the story may seem way out at first . But listen to their words . You 'll realize that in some ways , they 're a lot like you-folks who grasp life 's joy by expressing themselves in their work . And , boy , do they express . Contrary to what you might think , whirligigs , pink flamingos , tire planters , and concrete chickens are not the sole province of the rural and working-class South . Actually , they reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in the 1800s , every proper Englishman 's garden had a folly-some whimsical thing you put there to show your neighbors that you were n't completely buttoned-down , " explains garden writer Felder Rushing . " Buttoned-down " is not a term anyone applies to Felder . His front yard in Jackson , Mississippi , is a horticultural amusement park , replete with bottle trees , bathtub sculpture , painted tires , steel girder gongs , copper toilet floats drifting lazily across a fishpond , and a model train chugging through zinnias . Some neighbors love his garden . Others move away . But Felder staunchly defends his art . Anyone with a recycled whiskey barrel planter ca n't say anything about a person with a recycled tire planter , " he asserts . " And anyone who hangs gaudy earrings from holes punched in their ears ca n't say squat about those of us who hang bottles in our trees . " Greg Duke of Andalusia , Alabama , is more mainstream . He builds birdhouses . But not dime-store-quality birdhouses . No , his handcrafted creations are eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells them through garden shops . He also ships from his home . ( Check out his Web site www.duke birdhouse.com . ) Prices range from $150 to $750 plus shipping . Though his houses do accommodate birds , Greg designs them primarily for display . " I do n't build for the birds , " he states . " I build for the customer . " Lest you think Greg is too conventional , guess where he secures his raw materials . " I recently bought a 77-year-old school . I 've been tearing it down for a year and a half , " he says . " That 's where I 'm getting 90% of my materials . I use the tongue-in-groove lumber for ceilings and walls and old tin for roofs . I take doors apart and build birdhouses out of the panels . This school is so big , I 'll probably get 1,000 birdhouses out of it , Lord willing . " You ca n't help but smile when you arrive at the home of L.V Hull in Kosciusko , Mississippi . L.V owns more shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stakes . Displayed among such heirloom plants as golden glow , four-o'clocks , tiger lilies , and old purple phlox are all sorts of gaudily painted articles-tires , TV sets , clocks , hats , plastic flowers , bottles . Colorful wooden signs reveal the rules she lives by : " Be true . " " Mind your business . " " Jesus is coming to Kosciusko . " " If you do n't know where you 're going , any road will take you there . " L.V utilizes found and discarded objects . Though you might dismiss her raw materials as junk , she claims other primitive artists in the area compete fiercely for them . " Some folks are like dogs on a haystack , " she proclaims . " They ca n't eat it , but they do n't want anybody else to have it . " Her ideas , she believes , are gifts from God . " If they were n't , I could n't do this , " she contends . " I have lots of imagination . " Yet she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In my line of art , people do n't know what I 'm thinking , and thank God they do n't , " she declares . " It 's good to create something that somebody loves that they do n't know what it 's about .

" It makes you feel good when you make something that somebody else likes , " L.V explains . " That 's some good medicine . You do n't need to go to the drugstore to get that . " Yard art may not suit everyone 's taste , but who would want that anyway ? No one ever established a beachhead by being like everyone else . So tonight , when it 's dark and no one is looking , give in to the urge . Stick a bottle tree in your yard . I promise that as soon as the sun rises , no neighbors will ever see you or your garden in quite the same light again . Photograph Painted shoes by the hundreds mark the home of L. V. Hull .
