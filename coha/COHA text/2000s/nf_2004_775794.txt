What Is a Memory ? // What sort of future is coming up from behind I do n't really know . But the past , spread out ahead , dominates everything in sight . - Robert M. Pirsig Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance // Like tiny islands on the horizon , they can vanish in rough seas . Even in calm weather , their coral gradually erodes , pickled by salt and heat . Yet they form the shoals of a life . Some offer safe lagoons and murmuring trees . Others crawl with pirates and reptiles . Together , they connect a self with the mainland and society . Plot their trail and a mercurial past becomes visible . // Memories feel geological in their repose , solid and true , the bedrock of consciousness . They may include knowing that it 's hard to lead a cow down steps , or how the indri-indri of Madagascar got its name , or the time you accidentally grabbed a strange man 's hand in a crowd ( thinking it was your friend 's ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or your first car ( a used VW that rattled like an old dinette set ) , or a grisly murder you just read about that made you rethink capital punishment , or an unconscious detailed operating guide to the body that manages each cell 's tiny factory . // Memories inform our actions , keep us company , and give us our noisy , ever-chattering sense of self . Because we 're moody giants , every day we subtly revise who we think we are . Part of the android 's tragedy in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner is that he possesses a long , self-defining chain of memories . Though ruthless and lacking empathy , and technically not a person , he can remember . Played by Rutger Hauer , he contains a self who witnessed marvels on Earth and Mars and fears losing his unique mental jazz in death . // Without memories we would n't know who we are , how we once were , who we 'd like to be in the memorable future . We are the sum of our memories . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change your memory and you change your identity . Then should n't we try to bank good memories , ones that will define us as we wish to be ? I 'm surprised by how many people do just that . Even tour companies advertise : " Bring home wonderful memories . " Here we are , a happy family taking a Disney cruise , documented on film . But memory is n't like a camcorder , computer , or storage bin . It 's more restless , more creative , and it 's not one of anything . Each memory is a plural event , an ensemble of synchronized neurons , some side by side , others relatively far apart . // Everyone will always remember where they were on September 11 , 2001 , or when men first walked on the moon . Shared memories bind us to loved ones , neighbors , our contemporaries . The sort of memory I 'm talking about now is n't essential for survival , and yet it pleases us , it enriches everyday life . So couples relive romantic memories , families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other , as if they 've lagged behind on a trail . Sifting memory for saliences to report , they reveal how vital pieces of their identity have changed . Aging , we tailor memories to fit our evolving silhouette , and as life 's vocabulary changes , memories change to fathom the new order . Lose your memory , and you may drift in an alien world . // Mind you , memories are kidnappable . Radio , television , and the print media purvey shared national memories that can usurp a personal past . All the why 's can change . A world of artificial memory , as the British neuroscientist Steven Rose points out , " means that whereas all living species have a past , only humans have a history . " And , at that , it tends to be the history of the well to do . Thanks to the compound eye of the media , millions of people are spoon-fed the same images , slogans , history , myths . What happens to individual memories then ? Some rebels refuse that programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But most people do adopt values and interpretations of events from the media , their neighbors , or a favorite tyrant . Official history changes with each era 's values , which can sometimes be perverse , what Jung described as a large-scale psychic ailment . " An epoch , " he said , in Modern Man in Search of a Soul , " is like an individual ; it has its own limitations of conscious outlook , and therefore requires a compensatory adjustment ... that which everyone blindly craves and expects - whether this attainment results in good or evil , the healing of an epoch or its destruction . " Still , though no one is an island , most are peninsulas . Our lives would n't make sense without personal memories pinned like butterflies against the velvet backdrop of social history . // Scientists sometimes talk about " flashbulb " memories so intense they instantly brand the mind . Photography provided something different : push-button memories that revolutionized our sense of self and family , which we often remember in eye-gulps , as snapshots . Walt Whitman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lovers and sometimes what they did for a living , as though he might one day forget his moments of loving and being loved . But I think he would have preferred photographs of those dear ones to help recall the liquid mosaic of each face . // Picture yourself younger , and what image forms ? Most likely it 's a static image , a snapshot someone took . Memories can pile up and become mind clutter ; it 's easier to store them in albums . We remember our poses . Each photograph is a magic lamp rubbed by the mind . When we 're in the mood , we can savor a photograph while sensations burst free . Right now , for example , I 'm holding a photograph of a pungent king penguin rookery in Antarctica , and I remember the noisy clamor like a combination of harmonica and oncoming train . I remember how inhaling glacial cold felt like pulling a scarf through my nostrils . I remember that , in such thin air , glare became a color . // Whenever we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably edits it . It may pale . It may acquire a thick lacquer of emotion . The next sentence may sound a little bizarre because English grammar is n't congenial to time mirages , however : photographs tell us who we now think we once were . Photography , like most art , stores moments of heightened emotion and awareness like small pieces of neutron star . Years later , a memory 's color-rodeo may have faded , or may remain vivid enough to make the pulse buck again . Each response adds another layer until the memory is encrusted with new feelings , below which the original event evaporates . Imagine a jeweled knife . First you change the handle , then you change the blade . Is it the same knife ? // We tend to think of memories as monuments we once forged and may find intact beneath the weedy growth of years . But , in a real sense , memories are tied to and describe the present . Formed in an idiosyncratic way when they happened , they 're also true to the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced , and new values , passions , and vulnerability . One never steps into the same stream of consciousness twice . All the mischief and mayhem of a life influences how one restyles a memory . // A memory is more atmospheric than accurate , more an evolving fiction than a sacred text . And thank heavens . If rude , shameful , or brutal memories ca n't be expunged , they can at least be diluted . So is nothing permanent and fixed in life ? By definition life is a fickle noun , an event in progress . Still , we cling to philosophical railings , religious icons , pillars of belief . We forget on purpose that Earth is rolling at 1,000 miles an hour , and , at the same time , falling elliptically around our sun , while the sun is swinging through the Milky Way , and the Milky Way migrating along with countless other galaxies in a universe about 13.7 billion years old . An event is such a little piece of time and space , leaving only a mindglow behind like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better word , we call that scintillation memory . //
