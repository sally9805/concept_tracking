I WAS MY WIFE 'S IDEA . Perhaps that 's worth emphasizing . She was the one who suggested the baby . I just complied . Voila : blue line , pink line , success . I brought home champagne and oysters to celebrate . But the pregnancy seemed hard on her , a shock to her system . <p> Well , she 'd spent thirty years alone in her sleek body . I 'd call her streamlined . The kind of woman who does things quickly . Walks fast , gets in a lot of talking before breakfast , sorts out paperwork like a postal worker on speed . <p> It was n't that she slowed down or gained weight or anything . In fact , she grew even thinner the first couple of months . I told her I hoped she was n't carrying Rosemary 's Baby : a little comic relief . I knew it must be rough trying to make it through her long days and not look like some demon seed was sprouting inside her . <p> The doctor said that she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie back for a change , watch some TV . She just had to recline and let the baby do its thing . And that 's what happened . Her face turned shiny and pink , freckles melted back into her skin , and her stomach swelled underneath her nightie . <p> She was in labor for over thirty hours . I helped with her breathing and let her scream . I did n't say anything when she bit me . But it took me aback . When you marry a woman , you do n't look ahead to a day when she will try to rip the flesh off your hand with her teeth . <p> Then it was over , and we saw what we 'd achieved : our beautiful baby . I beamed at my wife , and she beamed back at me , and we both beamed at the baby . On the way home from the hospital , she chattered happily about painting stars and clouds on the ceiling of the baby 's room , how much she loved the baby and how much she loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take care of the baby . <p> Because that was the plan . Everything was ready . Shirts the size of handkerchiefs hung in a neat row . We had gotten the books , the bibs , the booties , and we 'd set up the state-of-the-art crib , with little lambs hanging overhead . We devoted the first weekend exclusively to the baby . We tried to bathe it in the kitchen sink until it started screaming and my wife started weeping . Then we folded the baby into its white blanket trimmed in blue bears and pink hearts and lay beside it on the living-room carpet , holding hands . There we were : a happily married couple with our new baby . <p> Monday morning I went back to work . I made my own breakfast , knotted my tie , and kissed my wife , who lay dozing in bed , the baby 's mouth suctioned to her left breast , which stuck out of her nightie , shiny and swollen . I stroked the smooth skin , and she moaned , putting her hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , but I closed the door behind me , giving her a chance to take the day slowly . <p> At first , everything went swimmingly . By the end of that week , she was adept at sticking its arms into the little shirts , and by the end of the second , she could tenderize chicken breasts with one hand while the other held the baby 's head to her breast . That was another thing . My wife started cooking . <p> I figured that we 'd rely on take-out or delivery as we always had . But my wife picked up a few women 's magazines , the kind she usually did n't bother to paw through in checkout lines . By the end of the third week , she was subscribing to five of them . I 'd come home , and there would be Chicken Paprika , carrot curls and rose radishes on the side , Lemon Whip for dessert . I told her that she did n't have to , but she said it was interesting . She thought I was interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't drink . Then she 'd watch me . <p> " Is it good ? " she 'd ask the moment I got a mouthful of food in . <p> " It 's great , " I 'd say . It always tasted fine to me . Home cooking was a treat . <p> " So what happened today ? " she 'd say . " How did it shake out with Spinelli ? " That sort of thing . I 'd talk while she jiggled the baby . <p> I do n't know when everything started to get balled up . <p> To be honest , I did n't see that much of the baby . I 'd propped a heart-shaped frame with the baby 's picture on my desk , but that was from the first weekend of the baby 's life , and it looked more like one of those blind newborn mice than anything . I did n't see my wife that much either , but it 's not as if I abandoned her . I was usually home by eight . We 'd have Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the baby would fuss , then all the Good Night , Baby rituals . I tried to help , but I was all thumbs . Too big or loud or clumsy . Besides , I never knew where she kept anything . Still , I do n't think that bedtime behavior was good for her , or for me , or for the baby . After my wife twinkled up the " Mary Had a Little Lamb " number half a dozen times , she 'd kneel beside the crib and whisper , " Please . Please . Please . Please . Please . " I do n't know . Is that supposed to help ? It did n't sound helpful tome . <p> Before long , she stopped exercising with Renee on TV . My wife told me that herself . It was n't like I checked her thighs for cottage cheese . She said that if she saw Renee 's perky face again , she 'd scream . I laughed . She said that if she saw Renee 's perky butt again she 'd knock over the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be funny . But she would n't quit . If she saw Renee on the street , her life would n't be worth a hill of beans . <p> Then there were the cakes . <p> We 'd been having dessert ever since the magazine thing got going . Date bars , peaches and cream , instant pudding . She tried a White Cloud Cake from scratch , but its layers did n't rise much beyond the height of three pancakes . We tossed it . No big deal . It was n't like I said I had to eat cake or I 'd go insane . The night following the White Cloud defeat , she served up one of those supermarket cakes with ice cream . The cake was OK . It 's not as though it was a big topic of conversation . It disappeared from the fridge in what I 'd say was the normal time span for cake disappearances , nothing alarming . <p> But the day after she tossed the empty cardboard , a new one appeared . Another grocery store job but bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollops of chocolate circling the rim . Then they started coming in a steady stream : Bundt cakes , carrot cakes , orange cakes , lemon cakes , peppermint cakes , Boston creams . We 'd have a slice after dinner , and then , boom , the cake was gone , another taking its place the next evening . <p> After a few weeks of this , I poked my head in the fridge to find a huge blue box from the upscale French bakery . Everything had been shoved aside to fit it in . I opened the carton and stood there blinking at an enormous , whipped-cream concoction , all peaks and cherries . It was the biggest cake I 'd ever seen . <p> " My God , " I said . <p> My wife had come in behind me and peered over my shoulder . " It 's something , is n't it ? " <p> I lowered the lid , then closed the refrigerator door without saying anything . <p> When she called me in to dinner , thick white slabs loomed on our dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake each . My wife pulled her napkin out of the elephant napkin ring , flicked it in the air , and gracefully laid it in her lap . Then she forked a mouthful . <p> " Honey , " I said . <p> " Yes ? " she said , her voice thick and creamy . <p> I did n't have the heart to say anything , but I knew something was going on . And I was right . That was the end of her cooking . Instead , she took to weeping . <p> " She 's been trying so hard , " my wife wailed when I walked through the door . I handed her a Kleenex from the box she 'd placed on top of the TV . The waxy build-up commercial ended , and another about skillet dinners began . <p> " You 've been cooped up for a while , " I said . I patted her bare knee , which still looked good to me ; it was n't as if I could see the cakes reappearing in her body . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie . " <p> " But the baby , " my wife said , looking up at me , sniffling . <p> " The baby 's not old enough to go to the movies . " <p> Apparently , once again I had n't said the right thing . My wife stared at a commercial for feminine protection . She lifted a tissue to her face . <p> " What if someone else looked after the baby ? " I asked her . <p> " You ? " <p> " No , no , " I said . " Someone who could help with things . Regularly . " <p> She began ripping up her pile of tissues . " I do n't know , " she said . My wife could look very young when she shrugged , especially when she was n't dressed . " Another woman ? " <p> I pulled up her nightie as I ran my hand up her thigh . The thigh looked pretty good , too . Renee or no Renee . I said , " Would n't it be nice to have someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like I do n't ? " She pushed my hand away . <p> I looked around the place so she could see that I was looking . It was n't neat as a pin anymore . I 'd written DUST ME on the TV screen with my finger , and the TV stayed that way . Then I glanced at my wife to show that I 'd noticed the mismatched socks , the stained nightgown , the lopsided ponytail of uncombed hair . <p> " I take good care of the baby , " she said , and jutted her chin out at me . <p> That was true enough . Whatever else , the baby got its due . " But the baby 's clothes , " I said quietly . <p> " What 's the matter with the baby 's clothes , for Christ 's sake ? " she said . " I spend a lot of time on those clothes . " <p> I lifted the baby out of its playpen to show her the black satin pantaloons , the tiny maroon cape tied below its chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife turned back to the TV . <p> " I 'll call an agency in the morning , " I said . " OK , sweetheart ? Let me do this for you ? " <p> " Jerk off , " my wife said , and she did n't usually say such things . <p> I knew I had to get on this one in a hurry . I made the initial calls from the office and got the ball rolling . My secretary interviewed the women because my wife would n't have anything to do with it . Bev came through for me before the end of the week . " I think I 've got her , " Bev said . " I think she 's what your wife needs . " <p> When I told my wife , she threw the TV Guide at me before she ran into the bedroom crying . Of course , I followed her . I did the usual back-patting , there , there , baby . <p> " So is she some hot babe ? " she asked me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into my home and take care of both of you ? " <p> " You 're thinking of a movie , honey . " Laughing , I held her in my arms and kept patting . But she 'd gotten me going . I pictured Giselle , Danielle , Justine . Some lithe nineteen-year-old with slender thighs and little breasts that peeked out of her clothing as she stretched and stooped around the house . She 'd be French . She 'd be lonely . She 'd look up to me . I put my hand between my wife 's thighs , and she finally let me . <p> It turned out her name was Danielle , and she was good-looking . Not wispy French though . Dark brows and light-brown skin . Cropped brown hair . She looked hearty . The kind of woman who has calves , like she could run a marathon and afterwards make everyone something to eat . <p> My wife stayed in the kitchen while I gave Danielle the tour . Then I took her to the baby . <p> " Here 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danielle reached in , scooping up the baby , who was dressed in a black-and-white-striped jumpsuit , a black-and-white pillbox hat on its head . She laughed , holding the baby out to get a look at the get-up . It took me a few seconds . Then I understood . The baby was a jailbird . <p> " So , " I said , a proud papa smile plastered on my face . " Everything OK ? " <p> She brought the baby to her chest and looked at me . " Sure , we 'll be fine . " <p> " Honey , I 'll leave you and Danielle to get acquainted , " I said to the bathroom door . <p> " Go fuck your mother , " my wife yelled . " And leave me the hell alone . " This last part also was screamed . <p> When I walked into the living room , Danielle was seated on the couch , cradling the baby , her mouth in a downward smile . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . " My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , " she said . " It 'll be OK . " <p> But it was n't OK . My wife would n't let Danielle near the baby again . She got one of those front packs and strapped the baby to her chest . She vacuumed with the baby , dusted with the baby , and washed out the tub with the baby against her breasts . <p> Danielle called me at work and said that she wondered if she was doing any of us any good , but I told her it did a lot for me just to know she was there . I said that she should meet me for coffee , we could talk about things . She said she 'd be happy to at the first opportunity . I said that for the time being she should sit back and relax . And that 's what she did . When I came home , Danielle was eating Cheez Doodles , her muscular legs taking up the length of the couch . It seemed to me that with legs like that she should be running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me cheesily . I heard the roar of my wife 's devotion to her domestic duties coming from the bedroom . <p> But a person can only keep up with something so long . Monday morning , my wife could n't get out of bed . She 'd brought the baby in sometime during the night , and it lay sleeping on her chest . I was surprised she had n't glued it to her . When she heard me , she tried to lift her head from the pillow . Finally , she gave up . <p> " I ca n't do it , " she said , a woman defeated . <p> I called Danielle in from the other room . She put down her Dunkin ' Donut and followed me . <p> " Take it easy , " Danielle said as she lifted the baby out of my wife 's arms and into the crook of hers . " I 'm here to help you . " <p> I closed the door behind me . <p> When I came home that night , they were watching TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutu and a rhinestone tiara . " Well , hello , " I said . " There 's my . . . baby . " I hesitated at the outfit but did n't want to disturb the peace , so I chucked the baby under its chin . " And my two favorite ladies . " <p> Danielle smiled and offered me some of her nachos . My wife did n't say anything , but she let me kiss her cheek . <p> The next night when I came home , the television was off . Female laughter floated from the kitchen along with the smell of cooking . I found my wife chopping up salad greens while Danielle rocked the baby , who was dressed in Farmer John overalls and waving two small red cows in the air . <p> " Dinner 's almost ready , " my wife told me . <p> " Great , " I said . " You ladies are going to spoil me . " I beamed at the two of them . " What are we having ? " <p> " Salad and spaghetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loaf of Italian bread . <p> " Great , " I said . I yawned nonchalantly and opened the fridge . No cake . " Great . " <p> The following night I almost fell over the coatrack when I came home . The place was pitch black . After I managed to hit the lights , I looked around for a message , but there was n't any . It occurred to me that my wife and baby had been home every night since I 'd had them . I mean , since we 'd had our baby . I made myself a martini and waited . Checked my watch . Checked to make sure the phone was still working . Turned on the TV . Made myself another martini . I ended up passing out on the couch . When I woke up , it was morning , my wife asleep in our bed , the baby asleep in its crib . <p> " Honey , " I said , shaking her . " Did you go out last night ? " <p> " Mmm hmm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> She mumbled into her pillow . <p> " What ? " <p> " Everybody wanted to go dancing . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " I said , but my wife was snoring . <p> The night after that , I opened the front door cautiously . The lights were on . I smelled something warm and cheesy . " Hello ? " I called . When I walked into the kitchen , no laughing women greeted me . I opened the oven : two trays of lasagna . A slow dread settled into my stomach as I cracked the refrigerator door . Still , I sucked in my breath as I saw a blue box from the French bakery . I slit the tape and looked in : Mocha Swirl . <p> " Honey , " I shouted . No answer . The bathroom door was open . Empty . The bedroom door was closed . I quickly pulled it open . Empty . I looked in the baby 's crib . No baby . " Honey , " I said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby . " <p> I made a pitcher of martinis and brought it into the living room . As I sat down on the couch , I noticed a white rectangle taped to the TV . I got up , pulled it off , and read , EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO TO GREECE . WE LEFT YOU SOMETHING TO EAT . <p> I turned on the TV and poured myself a drink . I thought about the whole thing . I could see Danielle . Those legs were meant for a Mediterranean shore . I could even see my wife : the kind of woman who does things quickly . But I was n't sure it was fair to include the baby . After another couple of drinks , it seemed to me that maybe the baby had wanted to go to Greece . Who was I to say ? <p>
