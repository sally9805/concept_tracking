Chapter One The hunter had returned . Decompressing , he called the time he needed alone after coming home from an assignment . But Olivia knew it went deeper . He was trying to shake off the mind-set of the man he 'd hunted for the past month . He 'd told her once it was like spending time in a sewer and he did n't want to poison her with the stench . Was it wrong of her to want him to share his world ? She descended the stone stairs that led to the basement of their mountaintop home and the room she referred to as Sebastian 's " cave . " She 'd called it so affectionately at first . Now there was a trace of resentment that left a bitter taste at the back of her throat . At the door she hesitated . Bent over his paperwork , he was surrounded by all sorts of electronic gadgets that could have come from a science fiction movie set . His mind was focused , laser-sharp on his task . The lean muscles of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stance often enough to recognize he was detaching himself from one world and trying to reconnect with another . Why did that passage make her so sad ? She 'd lived with him for ten years . She knew everything about him . The way he brushed his teeth . The way he peppered his corn . The way he checked the oil in her car before he left on assignment . But she did n't know his heart . After all these years , he still kept it to himself , its contents as secret as his operations . He loved her . She had no doubt about that . But she wanted it all - the bad and the good . Not just the castle in the air he 'd provided for her . To keep her safe , he 'd said . But here in the rarified air she did n't know what she was capable of . And the longing for flight - for something more - grew every day . Especially when he was gone , and she was left alone with her thoughts . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . She found herself keeping things from him - thoughts she knew would upset him , musings he would take the wrong way , feelings he would n't understand . She did n't like that extra barrier between them , did n't like the way they were growing apart . Her fault . Sebastian had n't changed . He was the same driven man she 'd met at one of her father 's business functions eleven years ago . She was the one with the curl of anxiety gnawing at her . She loved him . She always would . Just watching him and all his intense self-assurance made her soul sing like nothing else could . But where was the answering melody ? She 'd signed on for a duet and lately had become aware she was singing a solo . He looked up from his work and smiled . The brightness of it caught her breath just as it had the first time . One touch . That was all it would take to evaporate her resolve . She slid her gaze from his . If she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . " I 'm almost done , " he said , turning back to his work . She hugged herself and leaned against the door frame . " Take your time . I just wanted to say good-night . " He glanced at his watch and frowned . " So early ? " " I 'm leaving , Sebastian . " The hard thud of her heart nearly drowned out her words . " Leaving ? I do n't understand . " No , he would n't . He could see through the eyes of evil , but the working of his own wife 's mind was alien . " I 'm going to my sister 's for a while . " As much as Paula wanted her to leave Sebastian , she would not approve of her plan , either . " I just got home . " " I know . I waited for you . " And that , she realized , had been a mistake . She should have taken the coward 's way out and left while he was gone . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all the years they 'd shared , she 'd owed him that much . She 'd thought hearing of her departure from her would hurt less than words scribbled on paper . She had n't counted on seeing the ridges of fatigue drooping the corners of his eyes and bracketing his mouth . She had n't known the pain in his eyes would arrow straight to her gut . And in the past month , she 'd talked herself out of the power of his magnetism . " I 've missed you , " he said . " Ca n't this wait ? " " No , I ... " She knitted her fingers and breathed in courage . " I need to get away for a bit . " She needed to prove to him she could fit in his world , and she thought the course in criminal justice at the community college in Nashua would give her a start - a point from which to connect . But if she told him , he would talk her out of it . Where would that leave them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on like this . He closed his eyes and blew out a huff of frustration . " Olivia , I 'm tired . Ca n't we talk this over in the morning ? " By morning , she 'd have melted into him and it would be too late . " No , I need to do this . " He went predator-still . Never a good sign . " This is n't just a vacation . " His dark gaze bored into her , making her feel caught in a trap . Was that how his prey felt when he closed in on them ? " You 're leaving me . " She shifted to the outside of the door frame . " I 'm not leaving you . " How could she explain ? How could she make him understand ? " I 'm going to myself , not away from you . " " That does n't make sense . " He gave her a puzzled look and rose from his black ergonomic office chair . He took one slow step . She had to hurry while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knotted in front of her , she licked her dry lips and focused on her goal . Everything else she 'd tried to dissolve the barrier between them had failed . " You 're a contained man , Sebastian , and I need to spill over . For a little while . Until I figure out where you end and where I start . " " I do n't understand . " The pain slashing his features twisted inside her . He took another step forward . Though she wanted to flee , she held her ground . " I 've known you since I was seventeen . We were married when I was eighteen . You have five years on me . You knew what you wanted out of life . This . " She arched her arm to encompass not only the room , but all of the house . " You . It 's all I 've known for the past ten years . " " I thought you loved the house . " Another step . She stiffened . " I do . " She 'd helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows , the way it fit snugly into the rocky New Hampshire landscape as if it belonged , the way each room was a restful den , made it a home , not merely a house . " It 's not the house . " " The village then . " His gun hand flexed . He would n't let her go . " You feel isolated . " " No , it 's not Wintergreen . " How could she resent a place where everyone knew her and treated her like a friend ? If she wanted a taste of the city , Keene , Nashua , Manchester were n't that far . Even Boston was only a few hours away . She straightened against the stone wall and hugged herself tighter . He stopped , let his head drop to his chest , then blazed her with a look of such sadness she nearly closed the distance between them to comfort him . " I 'm sorry I ca n't give you the baby you want . " That was a tiny bit closer to the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get thicker . But a baby would n't fix the hollowness growing inside her . Until Sebastian trusted her with all of himself , a baby would only complicate the situation . " It 's not the baby . " ( Continues ... )
