Those of you who know Mr. Jablokov 's fiction already will probably skip right past these notes , but since this story is his first one to appear in our pages , a few words of introduction are in order . Alexander Jablokov published five novels and about thirty short stories through the 1980s and 1990s , including A Deeper Sea , Nimbus and Carve the Sky . Then he fell quiet for a few years , perhaps because his two young sons took up the bulk of his creative energy , but now he 's back at the word processor and we 're happy to bring you some of the results . He notes that he 's indebted to David Alexander Smith for helping contribute to the story 's underpinnings . <p> THAT MORNING 'S JOB WAS a straight AI grab " n go . We 'd identified a rogue intelligence in a minimall on Route 222 , near Ephrata , PA . A clerk at the Intelligence Regulatory Agency , in the Department of Labor , had assigned it the case name Donald . Three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limpopo home environment store anchoring the mall 's right wing that day : Petra , Max , and me . I 'd worked with Max a lot . Petra was new with us . She 'd left a C-level outfit over in Philly to " broaden her background , " which meant that she had been laid off . That probably accounted for her foul mood , even though she 'd snagged a manager title , supervising us . Gorson 's was licensed for D-level and below , quite a comedown for her . If you 're used to Carries and Chucks , a Donald 's barely worth getting up in the morning for . But there she was , crisp and clean , sliding right for the service desk . My job was securing the staff and customers , then turning them over to the hired hospitality crew . Max 's was locking down the loading dock behind the store , where a semi was loading decorative flora and fauna . Petra 's was , redundantly , distraction and team management . " Hot stuff , man . " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're scoring big . I can feel it . " " Cool it , " I said . " Even at best , this AI 's really just consumer-debt-reduction level . Keep that in mind . There 's no big money here . " " Hey , not what you said the other night , eh ? " He winked at me . " This is just the first step . Things are turning around for us . " Despite myself , I glanced over at Petra . " Enough tequila , and I 'll say anything . " " Do n't get all hot , man . I 'm just looking to pay off that mortgage . " Max had a gigantic house , and an adjustable rate , from the days when Gorson really had been making money . That was before I came to work for them , naturally . Max grinned and sauntered off toward the loading dock . He was fully loaded with a powerpack , focused explosives , circuit suppressers . It was way more gear than I 'd ever seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : lost and damaged equipment cratered the bottom line . And what had Max said ? " You ca n't be too careful . " Which did n't sound like our casual Max at all . Damn me for shooting my mouth off that night . I 'd brought this AI into our target list , but I should n't have told Max how much I had riding on it . There was still a lot that could go wrong . " But how can these big trees live on my carpet ? " Petra 's voice came from somewhere behind glossy monstera leaves . Despite myself , I smiled . In just a few words you could tell she was the inane time-wasting client that was every salesman 's nightmare , the kind you could n't ignore , because sometimes they bought huge . " And why do n't they fall through into the basement ? I do have a basement . Did I tell you that ? " The clerk was soothing . " All the support gear is self-inserting and self-maintaining . It 's no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Structural stiffening is integral . Our installation team will do a full survey for your particular situation . " I swung through the store . Two middle-aged women stood near a lily pond , one with a frog on her hand , discussing lotus flowers . A gardener half-covered in butterflies stuck a pressure sensor into a thick vine . I had to sweep customers , but the Limpopo staff was my highest priority . The clerk talking to Petra was Sylvia , the gardener was Alphonse . My list had one more employee on duty that day , Maureen , sales and technical support , but there had been no way to predict the number of customers . Where was I ? Streams of hot light broke up the darkness . Steaming , rotting trunks loomed above me and gigantic leaves showered water as I brushed past . Glass walls loomed here and there , but the mulch paths always curved away before I reached one . No Maureen anywhere . She should have been past those giant pitcher plants , their maws filled with writhing mosquitoes and bluebottles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did n't those bugs die ? I got distracted , watching their unending death throes . They must keep the poor damn things alive as a demo , maybe with tiny spiracle-nozzled aqualungs . " But what about lights ? " Petra was plaintive . " I mean , here you 've got your growsuns . I 'll have sunburn by the time I get back out to my car . " Sylvia the clerk made a noise like she would do something about it - a sunsuit behind the desk ? - but Petra was not to be pleased . " Oh , it 's just sensitive skin . Despite my color . It 's my burden , you know . Dermal distress syndrome . But all I have at home is a couple of floor lamps . Nice ones , you know . Ming vase things . At either end of the couch . So these big tree things will die . " " We take the lighting into account , of course . The best solution is for focused microlights to crawl the stems at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into the leaf surfaces . By morning , they 'll have pulled back into their storage modules . You ca n't even see them . " " Oh , that sounds dangerous . " Petra was good . I had to give that to her . With all the floor clerk 's mental energy going to keeping her patience , she would n't notice Max and me as we moved into position . " I do n't want any fires . " " Not at all . It 's a mature technology .... " I had a spider plant once . I guess you 're supposed to water them . Ah , and there was Maureen , my target , with a customer . A businessman in an inappropriate Central Asian duster , goggles dangling around his neck , examined an orchid held out to him by a cute red-haired woman in a coverall marked with green stains . Her big black gum boots emphasized her slender legs . A pair of yellow rubber gloves hung over the edge of a muck-filled bucket . The man reeked of frankincense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where everything else smelled like you 'd squished it out between your toes . " Hey , " I said . " Which way to the club mosses ? " " Recreated genera are over there . " Maureen was cute , but somehow pegged me instantly as an unprofitable customer . I did n't have Petra 's skill at pretending to be a normal human being . The church-smell guy had Maureen 's full attention . But she had what looked like sucker marks on her pale skin . The climate had to breed all sorts of blood-sucking arthropods , and I tried to reassure myself that this meant she was n't really so attractive after all . That 's easier , when you 're about to take someone into custody . " Okay , " Max 's voice whispered in my ear . " I got the truck . Gave the driver a gift certificate to pick up some donuts , he 's happy , and the detention mesh is up , so no one else is getting in . They do an incredible business here . This thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a load of these prices ? After this is down , I 'm getting home to dig up some of those big spiky things I got growing down by the garage . " " Great , " I said , then switched channels . " Could I have your attention please ? " My amplified voice boomed through the jungle . " A cognitive enforcement operation is in progress . We have information about a rogue intelligence in the area . There is no danger . Repeat , you are in no danger . But security concerns require the detention of all citizens in the immediate area . Please relax and remain calm . We will have you on your way as soon as possible . " No one ever remained calm . The two women by the lily pond tried to scuttle out as if they 'd just remembered an important engagement . I stepped into their path . " Pardon me . Could you come this way , please ? " The shorter of the two , with huge dark sunglasses , barked , " Young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost my clients billions . That 's more important than whatever cheap paranoia you 're peddling today . " " This is for your own protection . " That particular lie must have been invented around the same time as fire . " Listen - " " I 'm afraid I must insist . " Her friend , a sweet-faced old woman with hair that glowed a radioactive blue and extremely nice breasts , took her arm . " We 'd better do as he says , Maude . " Maude had to know that violent resistance could get her fined , or worse . We were n't allowed to manhandle detainees without good reason , but the definition of " good " got looser the more money there was involved . For your average citizen , getting caught in an AI sweep was just bad luck , like getting stuck in a traffic jam . If Maude was smart , she carried detention insurance . " Can I see some ID ? " Maude was stubborn . I flipped it at her . She rolled her eyes . " lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People can be so cruel sometimes . The real money 's in B- and C-level AIs , but that did n't mean Ds were n't as real a threat to the survival of the human race . " Come this way . " I escorted them out and turned them over to the cheerful team we 'd hired to manage our hostages . " It 's a pleasure to have you with us today ! " a young woman in a pink smock said . " Would you like some guarana-jalapeno soda ? " " That stuff 's toxic , " Maude muttered as she pushed past her into the hospitality tent . " Get away from me . " I circled back . The bucket still stood in the clearing , the yellow gloves now floating in the murky water , but both Maureen and the guy in the duster were gone . I scanned for any hint that would make one direction better than another . There was subliminal movement all around me . All the leaves seemed to have tics . A branch groaned as it rubbed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scent of frankincense . If his scent generator had been flinging the molecules any harder I 'd have heard tiny sonic booms . I moved toward him as quietly as I could . A floor-length duster is a hell of an outfit for an interior forest . There he was . I could see him through a mesh of aerial roots . I 'd thought he was creeping away , but instead he was fiddling with something . I got on my knees in the wet mud , scuttled forward , and grabbed him . " Hey ! " A yank on his coat and he fell face forward into the muck . " I 've got an appointment , damn it ! My business depends on it . " No one ever yelled , " I was going to spend the day relaxing ! " People just did n't seem to give that sort of thing enough weight . He rolled and looked up at me . " She slid off into the trees . Smooth and quiet . She was n't running , but it was clear she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " He 'd given me Maureen 's whereabouts so far ahead of my question about her that I had started to ask it anyway . " You might have time to get her , if you move fast . " " Thanks for the advice . What 's that in your pocket ? " " This ? It 's , ah , an orchid . For my mom 's birthday . That 's today . " He pulled the purple flower out of his shirt pocket and examined it . " seems okay . She gave me a whole bunch of instructions on how to set up the pocket ecology for it , let it grow into your clothing .... " " Put it down . " " What ? " " Put the orchid down and do n't pick anything else up . You have n't paid for it , so you 'll have to wait . " I stood relaxed , waiting for him . If he tried anything , I was ready . " Oh , come on . " He seemed near tears . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up these things at the last minute .... I 'm a bad son . " " I 'm not here to deal with your family issues . " He sucked air through his nostrils , looked at me , and realized that his mother would have to wait a bit longer for her corsage . He set it gently on some moss . " Just my luck , grabbed by a bunch of benchwarming D-levels . Have you already checked out every programmable toaster in eastern Pennsylvania ? " I smiled at him . " You can tell us how to serve you better on the appropriate form . Plenty of them available in the lounge . " The hospitality lady was a shade less cheerful this time . " Would you like some coffee ? " " Eat me . " Duster swept past her . She looked like she was going to cry . I doubted we 'd get this team to work with us again , which was fine , because I did n't think we 'd be able to pay them anyway . Back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " No , man . All quiet here . You lose someone ? " " I have n't lost anyone . " But something about this situation was bugging me . I ran over to the bucket and pulled out the gloves . I turned each one inside out , but they looked like regular rubber fabric . The bucket seemed to contain only muddy water . I dumped it out and poked through it . Nothing in there but a half-rotted leaf she 'd probably plucked to keep the plants looking nice . The bucket itself was a single piece of vinyl . I kicked it away . Seismic analysis had indicated a significant cavern beneath the store 's floor . That was presumably where our target AI , Donald , was hiding out . Was there some kind of secret access to it from the sales floor ? " Taibo , " Petra said in my ear . " Where are you ? You should have everyone sequestered by now . " " One to go , " I said . " Just a second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " she said . " Let 's just wrap it up and go . " " I 'm on it . Really . " " Hey , man , " Max said . " Do n't get caught up in the details . Be a big picture guy and move on up . Get this right , and everyone will forget all about BaIa Cynwyd , you 'll see . " " Thanks for the career advice . " " Hey , no problem . " Max and I had gone out for drinks one night the previous week , not too long after I 'd gotten the lead on the Limpopo AI . I 'd been feeling good .. . and maybe a bit vulnerable too . I 'd gotten the lead from an old bud , Chet . Chet and I worked together , years before , at a beltway bandit tech consulting firm in Falls Church . Since then , I 'd knocked around through half a dozen careers , while he 'd gotten in on AI hunting early , and now was a partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-Atlantic market . He 'd given me a call a few weeks ago , just to catch up on things , and we 'd caught dinner at a Cambodian restaurant in Lancaster . Southeast Asian thinkingpins were rumored to be behind a lot of recent AI activity , and the cuisine had become popular among those who hunted AIs . Maybe they thought the spices would give them an insight into their quarry . Chet particularly favored tamarind , pouring it over things that did not require it . And he had given me a lead on the Limpopo AI , as a memory of old times . Maybe he felt sorry for me , I do n't know . This particular AI was something his employers regarded as too small-time to mess with . But to Max I 'd made it sound like I made the AI on my own , just from the clues . Something was going on . I picked up the wet leaf , and an image came to me : sucker marks on Maureen 's temples and cheekbones . I looked more closely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just a surface decoration . Its actual structure was a complex mesh . Jesus . An aicon . We were in over our heads . Aicons were datalinks from an AI to people who had decided to associate with it . We tend to call them " acolytes , " partially to demean them and make it seem like they are devotees of a carved wooden idol , rather than colleagues of something that disposes of more processing power than the entire world in 2010 . AIs with aicons are not D-level AIs . They are not Donalds or Dorises . They 're not even Craigs or Cindys . They are Brittanys and Boones . If that was the case , we were in real trouble . Not only does Gorson 's Cog Repo only have a D-level license , it has a D bond that 's pushing its face into the floor . Taking on an AI , an intelligent device physically invested in a populated space , is dangerous . Even D-level bonds are millions of dollars . C- and B- level bonds are gigantic funds , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive lawyers to protect their investments . Taking on a high-level AI with an inadequate bond was like jumping out of an airplane holding a paper umbrella from a Mai Tai . We 'd have to cancel the clean , now . Maybe we could grab a finder 's fee , which could run five percent or so of eventual recovery . But why would there be a B-level in a plant store ? I was overreacting . The leaf was ... I did n't know what it was . No way I 'd go crying to Petra about it . I 'd played clever detective with her too , making like documentary research and pavement pounding had scored this AI . I was n't ready to drop her respect down to zero again . So I went off station and ducked into the drier air of the lobby that occupied the central part of the overgrown strip mall . Down on ground level was a cutesy barewear store with lines of breasts , alternating perky and heavy , hanging in the display window , with a markdown bin of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that a few pushcarts with fringed canopies selling scented candles , decorative contact lenses ... and cute toys for kids . I 'd caught a glimpse of a baby 's mobile , schematic faces with big eyes and heavy eyebrows dangling from it . Children react to human faces before anything else , and infants will stare fixedly at one . Someone had clearly interpreted " stare fixedly at " as " enjoy " : the beginning of a lifelong misunderstanding . Competing restaurant logos flickered on the glass balconies above , and dripped down red and green . The scent of galangal and cilantro implied sinister Cambodian thinkingpins plotting the replacement of western civilization by a rack of cognitive servers . The gleaming cylinders of fish tanks penetrated the floor to their support gear somewhere in the cellar . A grainy red dot from a laser spotter marked out a fish a diner had chosen for lunch . A net dropped through the water and scooped it out , flopping . A waiter in a short jacket pushed a can stacked with covered dishes . " Hey ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extra tamarind ! " The staffer overhead tossed down a squeeze bottle , which the waiter caught deftly . " Special order . " I 'd been well and truly gamed - I knew it right then . I watched the waiter trot the cart out into the parking lot and disappear , presumably toward an air-conditioned bus with a well-equipped wet bar . Those B-level guys liked to hunt in style . I did n't see the entire plan , not yet , but I knew there had to be one . It was looking more and more like there was an unexpected B-level AI somewhere in that jungle , and that was what Chet and his crew were licensed for . Which meant that it was n't unexpected to Chet . But if he 'd known it was a perfect target for his crew , why had n't he just gone in to get it ? Why involve me and my sad sack colleagues from Corson 's Cog Repo ? There had to be a reason . Then I remembered what I had come out here for . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face with a black pageboy and red lips and held it up to the leaf I suspected of being an aicon . Maybe I had jumped to conclusions a bit too quickly and had imagined the whole thing .... The leaf vibrated . I saw a flicker of lights in what suddenly seemed depths within its folds . The leaf writhed and tried to grab on to the face . It was so sudden I almost dropped it . Some kind of skin adhesive along the leaf 's edge stuck onto my right pinkie . I shook it , disgusted , terrified , but it stuck fast , as if it had become part of my finger . It took an effort of will for me to calm down . It stopped moving after a few seconds , and a few more before it decided autumn had finally come , and dropped off my finger . I shoved the face in my pocket . THE BALA CYNWYD AI had really been an Ernie . It had gotten upgraded to Denise after Gorson himself had lobbied the IRA with processing metrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Denise " was pretty much an overgrown home media center hacked up by a neglectful but too-smart parent . No one likes these suburban domestic grabs , but they 're bread and butter cases . Maybe we got overconfident . Max and I went in as screen installers and managed to slide a real media center in to replace the AI , so none of the kids in the house even noticed . They often get attached to entertainment devices that were smarter than they were . It made choosing channels so much easier . But as we were turning out of the cul de sac , a repair van backed out of a driveway and , ignoring our car 's frantic envelope-violation signals , smashed right into us . Nothing disabling , but even saving human civilization wo n't keep you from serious trouble if you leave the scene of an accident . There was a lot of paperwork , and then we found that our fender had been pushed into our front tire , making our minivan undrivable . As Max and I tried desperately to pull it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked the street . Teenagers spilled out of them . Some quick action with a 3D printer had given them giant styrofoam turbaned heads with the weary and wise face of their aiconic image . seemed like this AI had a thing for early twenty-first-century Islamopop preachers . Not real aicons , thank goodness , and they had the merciful side effect of muffling those slogan-chanting voices - but if any of those kids suffocated , it would be our fault . Jesus ! There was Max , wrestling with one of them . What the hell ? He was supposed to be in the back of the van , disabling the AI 's comm links , not mixing it up . There were half a dozen minicams out already - a lot of people did n't get out of bed without turning on a video recorder . We were popping up as windows on the screens of every easily distracted cognitive activist in the country . Most of them had nothing but time on their hands , and could hop into their augmented walkers and camel-strut on over here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , small remote-control blimps circled above , denouncing us and our attempts to drive the human race back to a pre-post-industrial economy , disempower ethnic variants , and prohibit refraction-correcting eye surgery . There was only one thing to do now . I yanked Max off his victim and shook him . " Run ! " I said . " Wha - ? " He looked around , as if seeing the yelling mob around us for the first time . " Come on ! " We sprinted . No one had expected us to abandon our AI so quickly , and it took them a couple of seconds to react . I jumped over a car hood , leaving dents in the soft metal . Two guys managed to grab Max , but he shrugged out of his flight jacket , leaving them with nothing but fleece and leather . We 'd lost the AI . We were alive , we were free , but we were without income for the month . Like any bounty organization , Gorson 's worked on a Paleolithic reimbursement schedule : mammoth-stuffed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happy to feel her belly rubbing up against her spine quite so soon . " Oh , man . " Max shook his head at his own stupidity . " Do n't know what came over me . Little weasel . Could n't stand seeing his overpriviliged protesting butt out there while I 'm working to save him from the futility of his own existence , you know what I 'm saying ? " " Yeah , buddy . I do . " " Man , I loved that jacket . This sucks . " " Yeah . It does . " It was n't too long after that that Chet took me out to Tonle Sap and , while stuffing his face with oversauced pork , had slipped me the location of a so-far unidentified AI that was n't worth his company 's while to go after . Maureen dropped from a tree onto me as I reentered Limpopo . She might have been able to take me out right then and there , but she miscalculated . An angled branch deflected the force of her attack and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft undergrowth and came to my feet to pursue . She 'd already recovered . I caught a flash of flared nostrils and staring eyes . " You luddite terrorists can try to stop us , but you will fail ! " Her kick caught me in the solar plexus and threw me back into the undergrowth . " You 're just a taxicab for a DNA helix , you stupid meat processor ! " She had the singularity-sucking rhetoric down so well she could spout it while showing off her aikido moves . That was fine . She was confirming a few things for me . My job now was to stay conscious long enough to do something useful with my conclusions . No time for pride . She 'd be on me in a second . I tore at the nonlethal restraints on my equipment vest . Stickum , slippem , oopsy , barf em : stuff named by preschoolers , and that did things preschoolers would have found amusing . This gal moved like a martial arts expert , so I figured a vestibular disrupter like oopsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pissed me off anyway . I flicked the galvanic grenade at her and ducked . She took another kick at me , but spun around and fell with a desperate wail as her vestibular system sensed random tilts and accelerations . Now , where the hell was she ? She was only a few feet away-I could hear her crawling through the underbrush - but no matter which way I turned , huge elephant's-ear leaves were in my way . They pressed in , thick , fleshy , damp . I felt one unfurl against my cheek . I scrunched my face up like a baby refusing a spoonful of mashed peas . Like that was going to do any good . I unsquinted one eye . The leaf was covered with hairs , each three inches long . No . Not hairs . Needles , incredibly thin needles . " I have trouble , " I said . Petra said something in my ear , but I could n't understand it . Then I remembered the face . I reached down along my side , almost dislocating my shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got two fingers in , almost dropped it , and managed to pull it out . Everything had gone silent . The leaves formed a globe around my head , shutting out all sound and light . It should have been dark , but the surface of the leaf flickered . And now I could hear a sound , like the whispering of distant voices . They were saying something immensely important , something I absolutely had to hear ... I jammed my elbow back , and got the face from the child 's mobile up . Human beings sample , and use cheesy makeshift heuristics , because we just do n't have any brain capacity . If we tried to deal with the universe full on , our craniums would explode . AIs are different . They dispose of orders of magnitude more processing power , so they can see , hear , and know everything . That 's the theory , but shortcuts appeal , no matter how smart you are . If there 's something more valuable to use your processing on , you 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more worth having . So , if these aicons were something the acolytes put on to communicate with their AIs , the mechanism would n't necessarily run a full analysis every time . I 'd guessed the leaf responded to simple facial features like eyes , nose , eyebrows , mouth , and , like a child , like anyone , responded more strongly to the high signal-to-noise-ratio fake than the noisy , selfcontradictory , and contingent real . It clamped on the face and , for an instant , the rest of the leaves relaxed . I dropped and twisted , then elbow-crawled through the underbrush , following the trail of broken stems left by the redhead . Behind me , leaves rustled as they missed further confirming data , and failed to find cranial nerves , or chakras , or acupuncture meridians , or whatever it was they were looking for . She was on the ground , minimizing the need for balance . And the disruption was temporary . She 'd be on her feet in less than a minute . I crawled toward her and got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I managed to groan . " This is just a routine security operation . No ideological purification required .... " . She twisted away and kicked me in the head . Fortunately her gum boots softened the hit . I sucked muck but did n't lose my grip . I crawled forward onto her . " You do n't understand . " Maureen was near tears . " You 're going to break the Gardener down into processing units and use her to .. . manage an oil refinery , or something . " " Hey , it 's relaxing work . I hear it 's kind of like being a bartender . Surprisingly high job satisfaction ratings , when you look at the numbers- " " The Gardener is an artist , not a piece of iron-age industrial control apparatus ! You 're not getting her . She 's staying free . " A few inches farther and I could restrain her-a thick vine slipped off the tree that had been holding it up and fell across my shoulders . The damn thing was heavier than it looked . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder . By the time I realized what it was up to it had braced itself against some huge roots on one side and an irrigation pipe on the other , and pinned me to the ground . I dug my hips into the dirt and tried to squeeze out under it . Its pressure increased . I tore holes in the soft soil , but did n't move an inch . I was having trouble breathing . Maureen slipped out of my grasp and disappeared ... back up the tree , it seemed . I did n't care about that anymore . I was really feeling the lack of oxygen by this point . My vision was contracting , and I could no longer see anything out to the sides . What had led me to this miserable situation ? It might just have been the oxygen deprivation , but as I gasped for breath , I remembered something . After our dinner , Chet had slapped me on the shoulder and said . " Hey , Taibo , if you ever run into any trouble , be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Whatever happens , it will be worth your while . " It had n't made any sense when I thought about it , but it had been perfectly fine as pan of the flow of flattery and moral support that Chet had been offering me . He 'd told me that I could still make some money , if less than I had hoped , by calling him and his team in . Great guy , Chet . I hoped I 'd live to thank him . " Hey , man , what you doing on the floor ? " Max stood over me , vaguely puzzled . I tried to talk , but now there really was nothing in my lungs . I tried to point . " What , this fall on you ? " He yanked at it , grunted when it would n't move . " You get yourself in another mess , man ? Sheesh . Petra 's scrubbing the mission . You hear that ? Whole thing 's a big botch . I ca n't use any of my gear now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need it . Car needs a new transmission , and there 's a frickin " colony of squirrels in my kitchen exhaust fan . I try to chop " em up with the blades , but they just dance around " em . Got ta get pest control in there . Those guys cost . " So that was it . The last thing I would ever hear would be Max bitching about his household budget . " Just a second , man . " He stepped away , then reappeared , holding a shovel . He jammed it under the root and levered . The pressure on my chest lessened enough for me to catch a breath , but not enough for me to get out . He grunted and dropped his weight on the handle . I was able to scrabble out just before the handle snapped and the vine fell back down . I rolled onto my back . " What 's going on , Max ? " I asked , as soon as I got my breath back . " Ah , a big screwup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Happens . Happens to everyone . " " Gee , thanks for being so understanding . " My angry tone startled him . " Hey , man , I just rescued you . What are you getting so pissy about ? " " You knew this thing was a B-level AI when we came in here . " " What ? No , man , I - " I grabbed his shirt . " I shot my mouth off about getting a tip from my buddy Chet . And you knew it was a setup . Right away you knew he was n't about to be giving me anything valuable without getting something in return . " " Well , man , you guys do have this dysfunctional relationship . I do n't know why you hang with him . " I hung with him because he always bought dinner and because he managed to imply that he thought I was too smart to still be stuck with a one-bedroom apartment near an all-night convenience store and gradschool furniture with beer-can rings on top of the bookcases , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . The information about this clean was the first real thing he 'd ever given me . " That 's why you were carrying all that gear , " I said . " You thought you 'd take on a B-level AI with a couple of satchel charges and an electromagnetic pulse grenade ? Are you crazy ? " He had the grace to look shamefaced . " That damn adjustable-rate mortgage is eating me alive . I bought at the top of the market ... so I 'm an idiot . But , yeah , I was n't sure what was going on , but I knew there was money in it . " " But I still do n't get it , " I said . " Why did Chet give me that information in the first place ? What does he get out of it ? " " I can tell you that , " Petra said above us . Both Max and I jerked . I sat up , trying to squeegee some of the mud off my clothes with my hands , and he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a weapon that violated regulations . She sat down on a fallen mahogany log . She was my boss , and as a result I did n't particularly like her , but right now she looked young and bony , and as much in the crap as Max and I were . " Do you think we 're the only ones with money problems ? " she said . " Hell , things are tough all over , " Max said . " We know that . So what 's their game here ? Why was Chet setting up poor Taibo ? " Great . That 's the identity I 'd been looking for : " Poor Taibo . " " Because they 're up against it too ! They come off smooth , confident , world-beating ... believe me , 1 know . I smelled it , up there . Beagle &; Charlevoix . Great parties , champagne on ice in your hotel room , all that stuff . What was not to like about that ? After all , we had a trade secret . Someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trackers . You could detect the AI , while it had no data flow back . Worked great in a couple of major cases . The AIs never knew they were being bugged by their own aicons . " But now ... there are too many teams - trained teams , full of cog sci Ph.D.s , anthropologists , former Omega Black assault troops - chasing too few AIs and pushing margins down . Beagle &; Charlevoix has monstrous overhead . Big capital investments in equipment , lots of salaried staff , nice downtown offices with wood paneling and marble desktops . They 're just as hungry as we are . Hungrier , " cause their body is bigger . And they 're not meeting their bonding numbers . No one knows that yet , but they could n't credibly bid on a class B assault . They 've been doing Cs recently . Colleen over in Lehigh , and Cornelius way off in Wheeling . They did n't publicize it . Full dress operations , using full staff , just to keep everyone busy - I doubt they made much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the company . Personality conflicts , I 'd heard . That did n't surprise me . " But , like anyone else , if they 're called in on a job that 's going wrong , the bonding requirement is lifted , and the reinsurance is picked up by the Labor Department . So you , my friend , were set up . " She pushed hair off her forehead . " And there 's nothing we can do about it . Chet probably encouraged you to call him - " " If anything went wrong , " I completed . " Yes . I have his card in my pocket . " " Very nice of him to offer , " she said . " I think you should punch him up . " " No way ! No way ! " Max was furious . " We can take this one , man . We got it on the run already . You 're ready , ai n't you , girl ? Ready to blow the floor . I 've got the gear . It 's hot pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " game . We got the proper documentation , right ? A good-faith Donald . But it 's trying to get away . Escape ! If we grab it while it 's trying to get away , we 're totally legit . Oh , maybe a couple of fines here and there , but nothing that will cut too far into our profits . We 'll just let our accountants figure out what Une of which schedule those expenses go on . " " Max ! " Petra was too depressed to even spark up at being called " girl . " " This is n't a joke . This thing 's too big for us to grab . Even these guys , with a full team , will have trouble . " The thought was bitter . I could just see Chet and his crew rolling out of their wagons and swaggering into the store , the tails of their expensive black coats flapping as they collected the goods .... " Hey , " I said . " I do n't think I 'll have to call Chet at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He switched out of uniform , but seems to like the feel of the duster around his ankles . I should have guessed it just from that . He 's been watching us . He knows the whole story . " Now that I thought about it , it was obvious . When I 'd grabbed him , Duster had given me completely false information about where Maureen had headed . That was n't too suspicious in itself . People sometimes saw AI acolytes as some kind of oppressed ethnic group and tried to protect them . And he 'd slid around a little on whether he had to get to work , or get a birthday present to his mother . But the clincher was the way he 'd gotten all nasty about our D-level license . Except I had n't had a chance to show him my license . He 'd known the whole situation without seeing it . " Who ? " Petra demanded . " Who is it ? " I described Duster to her . Her face flushed . " I ca n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , at B &.C.; Arrogant little .... Bastards ! They had this whole thing set up . How far back ? Maybe since I left . " She and Max were both still excited , but I was ready to go home , take a hot shower , and go to bed , despite the fact that it was n't even noon yet . " Man , we are screwed . " Max shook his head . I 'd switched careers quite a few times in my life . Each time , it put me at the bottom of the hierarchy , behind people who , dumber or smarter , had had the sense to pick something and work their way up in it . And now I was here , go-to guy in a second-rate AI hunting troupe , tied to a charming hysteric and a depressive control freak . It was the most fun I 'd ever had , the first time I 'd ever felt that I made a useful contribution . So , I guessed it was time to make one . A thought had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He had no idea I had figured it out . None of them did . As far as Chet and his gang were concerned , we were all still the patsies he 'd set us up to be . " Petra , " I said . " It 's my fault . I got that information from - " " Never mind whose fault it is . Do you have anything to offer but your guilt ? " So she was back to being hard-ass manager . That was fine . I did have something to give her . If it was still there .... I searched down the path toward where I had first - encountered Duster . And there , vivid on the emerald of the moss , lay the orchid he had tried so hard to take off with . " I have an aicon . " Sure enough , if you looked carefully , which I had n't before , you could see the delicate circuitry embedded in the petals . " It 's linked into the AI its acolytes call " The Gardener . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on the loose . I think we should leave her that way . " " Okay . " Petra crossed her arms . " I like an employee who can turn a performance problem to some advantage . What are we going to do with her ? " " We 're going to let her escape . Along with her AI . " " Good news , folks ! " I 'd worked hard on the tone : a chipper front over defeat and failure . " You 're free to go . Just a small debrief , and we can have you out of here . Again , I apologize for the inconvenience . " They looked up at me . Most of them had been sitting around a folding table that was littered with half-eaten bagels , orange juice cartons , and mini jelly containers . Phones , screens , and other communication devices had been inactivated . That usually , after a long pause , resulted in something like a party . People often made friends in those few hours , and Gorson Cog Repo even had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been invited to either wedding . The data-futures lady , Maude , got up and bustled out past me , followed by her blue-haired friend . She gave a farewell wave to the shiftless plant maintainer , Alphonse , whose thick chest hair was now frosted with powdered sugar . He smiled vaguely , as if he 'd already forgotten who she was . Duster sat by himself , erect in a chair , like a Japanese warlord waiting for a report from a samurai . He raised his eyebrows when he saw me . If I was right about him , he 'd need to move now . If we completely disengaged from our pursuit , there would be no legal way for his team to take it over . " What happened ? " he said . " What 's going on ? " " I genuinely apologize , sir , " I said . " We were in error . There is no AI present here . " " No ... what are you talking about ? " " Oh , that 's internal business , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " He shoved it into a pocket , then remembered his cover story . " My mom ... I 'll need to go back and get that orchid . If you 've cleared out .... " " Five minutes , " I said . " Five minutes , and we will have officially declared this area AI-free - " That was too much for him . He stood up . " Jesus . You guys ca n't even handle a simple ... let me out right now . Maybe there 's still something to be salvaged from the situation . " Gone was the businessman obsessed with getting his old mom a flower . This was a well-paid , professional , class-B AI hunter . One , I reminded myself , who was just as much at risk of losing his job as I was . I had to play it carefully . I frowned , trying to look confused but not completely befuddled . " You 're a hunter , too ? You should have mentioned it . I had a nice cherry Danish I was saving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here ! There j ' . s an AI under there . If you pull back , you 'll lose it completely . " " Thanks for helping out , but there 's nothing under the floor . The cavern 's completely empty . Just a bunch of pots and stuff down there . Fertilizer bags . We thought it was weird , that it was so big , but maybe they 're planning to expand . " He stared at me , stunned . The subterranean space was clearly where most of the processing power was . A week or so before , Petra had driven a public works truck around the mall , seemingly examining pavement , but really sending seismic mini-shocks through the ground , outlining the nonconducting empty space that hung under the plant store like a giant egg . Our theory was that they had hidden the excavation waste as substrate in their various jobs . The rock and dirt from under the mall now resided in living rooms all over southeastern Pennsylvania . " You 've got the perimeter completely tight ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall access , everything . Nothing in or out . " I smiled with pride at our thoroughness . " Ah , you did ? " " Well , we ca n't very well sequester the whole mall now , can we ? Business has to go on . The place has deliveries to make . They lose a shipment , we 've got penalties to pay . Some of that stuff 's perishable . " " Shipment ? " His rising tone was so outraged that it almost made me break character by laughing . " Where ? Show me ! " " I think all those plants are paid for already , but sure . Sure . Come on . " We ran through the plants . I now knew where the path to the rear led , so I was able to get lost convincingly . After a bit of confusion , during which I thought he would try to strangle me , we got straightened out and found the loading dock at the rear of the store . The truck full of plants was just pulling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver out of the donut shop where he 'd relaxed , but he was now on his way to make his deliveries , just a bit late . " Damn it ! " Duster ran down the access alley , long coat flying , as he yelled into his phone . " Get a team down to the 202 onramp . We 've got a good possibility of a live escape ! What ? Yes , I 'm sure ! Hurry ! " It would n't take them more than a few minutes to discover that the thing was full of nothing but plants . And they were professional enough not to pull everyone off surveillance here at the store . But their surveillance would be light for just a bit . I moved . I 'd thought about how Maureen had arrived and disappeared . There did n't seem to be any access at ground level .... I was n't as limber as she was , but I was still a primate . I grabbed a branch and clambered up . The trunk seemed solid , at least on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under me , and I ended up dangling , ten feet or so in the air . That would look just perfect , when Chet , Duster , and the rest of the B-squad came sauntering in to take care of things . I worked up some momentum and managed to get a toehold on the rough bark . That gave me just enough support to walk hand over hand to the next branch , then lift a foot and get , at last , solid support . And there it was : on this side , the trunk just ended , with a ring of branches around it . A dark hole descended , with a convenient maintenance ladder on one side . " I 'm going down , " I said . " Wish me luck . " No one did . MAUREEN AND I spotted each other at the same instant . Instead of running , she charged straight at me . And as she did , I caught a glimpse of what she held in her hand . She was packing ... ! guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough : a neuromuscular junction suppressor , sort of a remote-control curare-by-RF . Worked on a human the same way that a HERF gun worked on electronics : AI 's Revenge . The thing made no noise at all . I might have stood there with my mouth open , and then collapsed without closing it , if she had n't , again , acted a bit too soon . The Gardener might be up to B-level , but its staff still required some training . My whole left arm was numb . Jesus ! I ran , stumbling and off balance , my arm dangling like a length of Italian sausage . The Gardener 's secret hideout was a vaulted space about twenty feet high that had been carved out of the earth beneath the minimall . Dirt had been heat sintered into a crude support shell , lumpy and sagging , with concrete squirted in here and there , seemingly at random . Clearly work done without a permit . A few dim lights showed roots that dangled through the ceiling into masses of perfusion tubes . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had to be what Maureen and her fellow plantsmen called the Gardener : a few complicated shapes that might , at one time , have been irrigation and growth hormone controllers , now grown into a self-aware entity . I dodged behind it . It was the only possible thing I could do . It was n't enough . " Stop , " Maureen said . A hummingbird that had somehow made it down into the cellar buzzed through the air , zigzagging in its search for a blossom . " Do n't kill the poor bird , " I said . " What ? " Her finger was on the trigger , but she did n't pull it yet . " You may think I 'm guilty of something , but that bird has n't done anything . Let it .... " It floated away . " Okay . " I scrunched my eyes shut . " What are you talking about , mister ? This thing is nonlethal . Just a little relaxation for you - " " Sure . If you have a sharp crash cart team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaphragm nerve connections go too , just as with curare . My breathing will stop . I should n't tell you , but , lucky for you , an autopsy wo n't show anything . Unless someone decides to do a neurotransmitter assay and discovers that there 's just too little acetylcholine in the postsynaptic receptors . I think you can bluff your way past that one . Not that it will matter much to me , one way or another . " She looked at me . I tried to act as if I were staring death in the face . Where the hell was Petra with Max 's explosives ? She shrugged . " I wo n't tell the Gardener , then . She 's kind of sentimental . " She squeezed the trigger just as the ceiling fell in on us . Max 's explosives had done a lot of damage . I heard cracking and shifting as the poorly engineered structure started to collapse over our heads . A tree , its roots loose , leaned over with a creak , and toppled . Soil showered after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit with a hollow thud . Solid columns of light rose around us . Concrete dust clogged my sinuses . I could n't see where Maureen had gone . I did n't want her hurt . That was n't the point of this particular exercise . I crawled through what looked like a combination plant nursery and machine shop , damaged by the cascade of rubble from above . An overturned sprouting tray dripped hydroponic fluid . Grow lights dangled over a project : a veined flower , like a crocus , with its petals floating free , supported by lines of translucent , glowing threads that marked out some complex function , soon to be concealed . A hedge of elaborate manipulator arms labored delicately over it , pulling lines through , connecting others , like a sewing bee . Several aicon leaves floated in sealed plastic bags on an old potting table . The Gardener 's original purpose had been to create biocircuits , hyperflow xylem , physiological sensors that allowed flower scents to reflect or lead the moods of the people in the room with them . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I patted the orchid in my pocket . It was still linked in , but the Gardener had no idea that it still existed . As far as it was concerned , Duster 's orchid had vanished . Someone groaned . I dug through the nibble , pulled off several stalks of bamboo , and found Maureen , bruised but still alive . And conscious . " Get away from me . " " I 'd like nothing better . But you 're the one who 's going to have to get away . With your little gardening gadget , if you please . " " What are you - ? " " Max ! " I yelled . " Over here . " Max deftly backed up two trailers with low railings , pushing them with an electric tractor . He 'd duct-taped a big yellow flashlight to it as a crude headlight . It shone forward , away from us , into the darkness of the escape tunnel that the acolytes had dug over long months , between the humming aquarium bases for the fish tanks that stretched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the gleam of fish as they reached the bottom and turned to go back up . " Do n't run over her ! " I waved frantically and he came to a halt a few inches short of Maureen 's outstretched fingers . Max peered down at her . " She good for this ? Or should I grab another of these Druoids ? " " She 's good . Just give her a couple of minutes . The roof just fell in on her . " " Hmph . " Max was carefully unimpressed . We went to work on the Gardener , in full view of Maureen , who seemed unable , or unwilling , to understand what was going on . I whacked at power interlocks . They were standard safety-release , but had been wrapped in resistant tape , then encased in resin . I figured that it would definitely be a problem to lobotomize your AI by tripping over a data cord , but this rose to the level of paranoia . Max and I sawed through , released the connections , pulled off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardener into the carts , along with a decent selection of interface devices . " You got that connection gadget ? " Max said . I glanced at Maureen , but she was checking over the Gardener , making sure it was all right . " The aicon ? Yes . " " Give it to me . I 'll take care of it . " " You 'll - " " lust give it . You 'll see . " Sometimes Max knew what he was doing . I handed it to him and he shoved it into a pocket . " Is it ready to get out of here ? " Petra asked from the darkness . " Just a couple of minutes and she 's ready to roll , " Max said . Maureen looked up from her AI . " What 's this about ? " " Us helping you to escape , you mean ? " I grinned at her . She remained expressionless . " It 's kind of complicated .... " " We want your AI , " Petra said . " We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damned if I let those bozos upstairs get it either . If you rip out of here in the next two minutes , sister , you 'll have it free . Otherwise , you 're a bounty for our competition . I really would n't want to see that . Do you ? " The silence stretched . By this point Duster would have realized that the truck was a distraction , and would be back with the rest of his team to cut off all routes of escape . As I thought about that , I found myself irritated with Maureen for not taking this obvious opportunity . In a real sense , it did n't matter if we were lying or not . If she did n't do something , her AI was done for . " Ah , screw it . " Max flipped a switch and the tractor motor hummed back to life . " She 's too dumb . I 'm taking this out . Ten percent finder 's fee is better than nothing . Better than sitting around down here trying to slap some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Maureen turned to me . " Is this true ? You 're letting me go ? " That was quite unnecessary . What made her trust me all of a sudden ? " Yes . But not because we want to . " " I would n't have it any other way . " She hopped on the tractor and hummed off into the dark tunnel . " Okay , " Petra said . " Have we really just let that thing go ? " " Nah , " Max said . " Me and Taibo , we 're all set . Now , let 's see what the smoothies do when they show up . " " I have to say , Taibo , that was a nice try with the truck . " Chet smiled at me . " Anton 's pissed , though . I 'd suggest staying out of his way when he finally turns up . " Chet 's team had arrived . Guys in long coats had spilled out of sedans with dark-tinted windows and smoothly closed off the mall . There seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gear , a support vehicle , and a separate online channel of coverage . I was no doubt showing up on thirty different feeds right now , edited in different ways , with various explanatory text crawls on my chest . I tried to look iconically like the Losing Team . It was surprisingly easy . " Anton " had turned out to be Duster 's real name . He had chased that truck for much longer than we 'd anticipated . Max 's hopped-up spiel to the driver had persuaded him to expect desperate plant hijackers , and he had led Duster and his team a merry chase along various Amish-cart-blocked roads down toward Lancaster . Duster , I gathered , had gotten a bit out of hand at the seizure , and been arrested by some local cops . The fact that the truck had come up completely clean of any AI activity would not do him any good at any hearing . Chet 's team would have to finish their job here before anyone could try to get him out of the Upper Leacock lockup . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bewilderment . " Why are you here ? " " We 've got to take this over , Taibo . " He managed to sound sad and reluctant , as if it had really not been something he wanted to do . " This has gotten completely out of hand . I had hoped you would be able to handle ... well , it 's all water under the bridge now , is n't it ? Some things look really easy when others do them , but then turn out to take a great deal of skill . Just remember that , next time . " It took every ounce of my willpower to keep from punching him . That was nothing you wanted to do while on two dozen channels of net coverage . People would be critiquing my form - " too much arm , not enough body " - before I was even under arrest . " So ... I still do n't understand . Are you helping us out ? " " No , " he said . " We 're not helping you out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It 's the only way , Taibo . I 'm sure you understand it . " There . He 'd finally gotten it out formally , though I was sure he 'd also filed the necessary permissions . Along with the AI , he 'd just taken on all the liabilities associated with the operation . Whatever happened , all the property damage was now entirely Chet 's problem . " This is a really dangerous AI , Chet . " I got all goggle-eyed and paranoid . " You have no idea - " He smiled and patted my shoulder . " Come on , Taibo . Let 's go in , and you can see how the big boys do it . " ETRA RAISED THE LID . " Who had the pork and coconut ? " " Me . " Max shoveled most of the bowl onto his rice and started eating . Petra looked at me and shrugged . We 'd all earned a decent meal . " Shrimp and baby corn . You on a diet , Taibo ? " She knew I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long haul , Petra . I do n't want to weigh myself down . " She shrugged . " Suit yourself . " The aromas of curry , fish sauce , and galangal mingled in the air . It had been an uncomfortable scene . Chet 's crew had torn the place apart . No Gardener . No aicons . Nothing . Just a huge hole in the floor and some astronomical liability . They 'd found Petra in the barewear shop trying on some delts she did n't need , and hauled Max out of his hidey hole behind a fish tank . The exposed orchid aicon had been the biggest risk . Max had n't yet said anything about what might have happened to it , and Chet had spent a lot of time looking for it , based on the description Duster had phoned in from his holding cell . Chet had spent some time telling me what an idiot he thought I was , how he had played me the whole way , how I had never had a clue . In the end , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his generosity to an old and unsuccessful friend in order to betray him . I 'd invited him to join us for lunch . As it happened , he had other plans . Petra glanced at Max , who still had his face buried in his food . " Okay , Max . Come up for air and tell us where the aicon is . " Max looked up , vaguely irritated , and , instead of answering Petra 's question , signaled a waiter . " Hey ! Where 's the extra ? " He then grinned at us . " I ordered another dish for us . From the fish tank . Stuff like that 's always best when it 's fresh . " " From the - stop screwing around , Max . " " You gave me the assignment ... ah , here we go . " The waiter pushed up a cart . Max grinned at him and took the covered tray from it . Petra stared at it . " How - " " Ca n't show it yet . Taibo 's buds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggie bag . We can haul it out with our lefties . I shoved it through the basement maintenance hatch of the fish tank with an almost-neutral floater . It 's an old drug smuggling trick . Thing looks just like some bit of kelp or something . Floated right up past these guys while they were charging around . " " Well , Max . " Petra sat back . " Very enterprising . " She looked at me . " You do n't look too happy about it , Taibo . " I had been moving my food around , but not eating it . " I - I do n't actually like shrimp that much . " " Hey , man , you scared that Maureen wo n't like you when you come after her supersmart gardening machine ? " Max laughed , spilling rice down his chin . " You got a steady job . She 'll forgive you . " I did n't look at him . He was my buddy , but sometimes he really annoyed me . " That really was good work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have a link back to the AI . Beagle &; Charlevoix have been forced to assume all the liability for this job , by formally taking it over . It 'll bankrupt them , guaranteed . " If I had n't known her dedication to AI hunting , I would have thought that the most pleasing aspect of the job was the damage it would do to her former employer . " But shorn of aicons , with its processing reduced for transport , this Brenda or whatever it is will still look like the Donald we originally thought it was . " She glanced at me , looked away . " Maureen 's looking for support from the acolyte underground , but it will be a few days before she manages to find it . " Neither Max nor Petra understood my position . I 'd been mediocre in various positions in the past . But now I had a job I was good at . It was in a declining industry , natch , but you ca n't have everything . The next step , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . " Let 's grab our leftovers , " I said . " Who 's driving ? "
