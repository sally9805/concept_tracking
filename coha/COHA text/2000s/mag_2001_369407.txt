It is , by all accounts , a horrific way to die . First come mood swings and numbness , then hallucinations , uncontrolled body movements and finally a progressive dementia that destroys the mind as thoroughly as Alzheimer 's disease  --  except that this illness can strike at any age . <P> No wonder Europe is terrified of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , better known as mad-cow disease . The illness started attacking British cattle in the mid-1980s . Then it crossed the species barrier ; a human version of BSE has killed more than 80 Britons since 1995 . Then it leaped across the Irish Sea and the English Channel , afflicting cows in 12 European nations . Last week Italy confirmed its first cases . Late last year , it hit Spain and Germany . Earlier this month , the German ministers of health and agriculture resigned in disgrace when their assurances that German beef was safe proved false . A handful of human deaths have been reported in France and Ireland  --  so far . <P> And now the U.S. is beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended that anyone who had lived in France , Portugal or Ireland for a total of 10 years since 1980 be prohibited from donating blood ( rules adopted last year excluded anyone who had lived in Britain for six months between 1980 and 1996 ) . The American Red Cross , meanwhile , urged the FDA to apply the six-month rule to all of Western Europe  --  which would cut the supply of donors 5% or so  --  even though there 's no evidence that the disease can be transmitted through blood in the first place . <P> Is all of this really necessary ? Probably not , say experts . For while the British were taken by surprise by the appearance of a new disease , and other European nations were slow to adopt strict precautions , Americans have , by a combination of luck and early preventive action , dodged this deadly bullet . <P> The first bit of luck came in the 1950s , when the U.S. banned imports of British goats and sheep . Reason : a flock of British sheep had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humans , it turns out , and generally harmless to cattle as well , even when infected sheep tissues are injected directly into a cow 's brain . But scientists believe some sheep carcasses , ground up to add to British cattle feed , carried an unusual form of the disease that did manage to infect cows . That variant , renamed BSE , began to show up in British herds in the 1980s , eventually afflicting nearly 200,000 animals . <P> By 1995 , the first cases appeared in humans ; the disease was re-christened yet again as a " new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease " ( VCJD ) because it resembled an existing illness whose cause is unknown . The new disease was probably caused by eating beef containing brain or spinal tissue from mad cows , since human cases invariably turned up in countries with BSE problems . <P> But the U.S. imported fewer than 500 cows from the British Isles in the 1980s , of which just 32 entered the food chain . By the end of the decade , the U.S. had prohibited the import of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal products and rendered animal proteins.
