Haptics technology lends the sense of touch to virtual reality . That might not sound very exciting , but it 's being used to train surgeons and rehabilitate patients <p> haptics , a fairly recent enhancement to virtual reality technology , gives users the touch and feel of simulated objects they interact with , usually through a device like a specialized mouse or a haptic glove . The touch technology is making its way into key areas such as the automotive industry and medical practice , and a few companies are successfully marketing haptic devices , which trace their roots to academic research . <p> But even as the market for this type of touch capability looks ready to take off , some academics say the technology suffers from limitations that may keep touch from revolutionizing virtual reality applications . <p> John Hollerbach , a computing professor and an adjunct professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Utah , says haptic devices and robotic devices share the same drawbacks , particularly involving limits to the miniaturization of motors . But that has n't stopped him from pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add the sense of touch to the mechanical design process . If engineers could design by feel , rather than sight , he said , they might not need to build a physical prototype in many situations . <p> " Not only should you be able to look at the parts you 're designing , you should be able to manipulate them by feeling them , " Hollerbach said . " You build a physical prototype to figure out how humans interact with it . With haptics , you might want to build a virtual prototype and include the sense of touch to simulate how the driver would manipulate controls or put things in a glovebox . You 'd be able to research reach and access . " <p> Hollerbach has a haptic device that uses a commercial technology , the Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master , which is linked to the Alpha 1 computer-aided design system developed at the university . This haptic interfacing simulates forces of contact and gives users the ability to trace a surface or grasp and maneuver it , he said . The device allows users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze objects . <p> One of the project 's challenges , however , is that CAD systems are n't designed to interact in real time with haptic devices , and haptic devices are n't designed to operate over complex curved surfaces such as those typical of many manufactured parts . So Hollerbach and his students are having difficulties aligning the CAD and haptic systems to trace and to feel by virtual touch the parts that engineers are designing . They are making progress , however . <p> Eventually , automakers using the device could make a virtual prototype of their assembly lines and include touch in the prototype . That way , mechanics could use the prototype to learn how to assemble parts before the assembly line is actually created . They 'd learn how to assemble the parts by feel , just as in real life . <p> And designers could ensure that the line runs smoothly before they build it , by operating it virtually , then checking by hand for interferences . For instance , a mechanic wearing a haptic glove could simulate reaching into a tight space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowly designed for a human hand to perform the motion easily , the engineer would know to redesign that part of the line without ever having built a prototype . <p> Because haptic devices are robotic devices worn and manipulated by humans , they are limited in their usefulness by the same things that limit robotics , Hollerbach said . And that always comes down to actuator technology . <p> After all , motors do n't follow Moore 's law - which says the number of micro-components that can be placed in an integrated circuit doubles every 18 months . <p> Haptic devices rely on very small motors that , in turn , rely on magnets to make them work , said Dean Chang , chief technology officer at Immersion Corp . of San Jose . Calif. , a company that makes and sells haptic devices for markets that include medical , automotive , and gaming . The gaming industry is a widespread user of haptic technology . When you use a joystick to fire a shot during a video game and you feel the reverberation of the gun , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are fundamental limitations on magnets , " Chang said . " With haptics , you want to feel like you 're cutting through tissue in a medical simulator and you need just the right amount of force for that . You do n't want to feel like you 're cutting through a rubber band . To generate that force , there are some minimal requirements . To exert the force , you need some kind of actuator . <p> " And that 's the limitation . Magnets are what they are ; it 's not like you can do something to make them more magnetic , " Chang said . " You ca n't change their properties and make them smaller . " <p> The reliance on magnets will keep the price of haptic devices from falling as technology advances , as happens in the computer industry , where the price of computing power falls as chips set smaller . " Technological breakthroughs are going to bring down prices , but not like we 've seen in other industries , " Chang said . <p> Grigore Burdea , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the actuators needed for the devices also keep them heavy and bulky . That 's a drawback in an industry where users often have to wear the devices to feel the feedback . Burdea has been involved in haptic research for the past 15 years , after developing a force-feedback glove at Rutgers . Haptics and Physical Therapy <p> Through the years , Burdea and his team have applied variants of that force-feedback glove to help people regain use of their hands after a stroke or surgery . The patients put on the force-feedback glove , which is connected to a computer , and simulate squeezing a rubber ball . The glove provides the feel of the ball . <p> " You can see the ball on the screen , but there 's nothing in your hand , " Burdea said . " The advantages of this are that it 's easy to collect data while the patient is exercising . Eventually , we want to place this in people 's homes so that people who 've had a stroke do n't have to go to a clinic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a philosophy that we want to make these kind of exercises fun , because they 're very difficult to do , " he added . To that end , the computer screen can simulate different backgrounds and games that the user can interact with and complete by use of the ball . <p> Burdea and his team have expanded the technology to what they call the Rutgers ankle , which aims to help rehabilitate the foot . A patient places his or her foot on a mobile platform and then performs exercises prompted on the computer screen . The platform resists the patient , with the resistance changing in accordance with how strongly the patient is pressing down . <p> The graduate students who helped Burdea create the ankle also thought of ways to make the simple exercise more enjoyable , and more challenging , for patients . <p> " They thought , let 's have the patients power a plane with their ankle , " Burdea said . <p> Because the ankle has different degrees of freedom , and can push , pull , or rotate , the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the patient is standing on the platform . <p> " Sometimes the physical therapist places hoops in front of the plane in different locations and the patient has to navigate through those hoops , " Burdea said . " There 's scoring , there 's timing . We never get a complaint that it 's boring . " <p> When patients are able to fly the plane easily through different hoops , they can graduate to piloting through turbulence and fog . <p> " So you are really learning control , not just strength , " Burdea said . " That 's for people who fall . People who fall do n't have good control . " A larger version of the Rutgers ankle allows patients to simulate walking , including walking over a variety of terrain like mud or gravel , or up stairs . The walking ankle beats simple treadmill walking - which is often used in physical therapy today - because it allows patients to master walking on an uneven terrain or on an incline . <p> But the very device that helps users simulate walking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . All haptic devices , by their very nature , come in direct contact with users . How else could they feel the force feedback sense of touch ? But that contact means that safety becomes an issue , Burdea said . Cost as a Barrier <p> " You can really get hurt with haptics if you do n't pay attention or if there 's a malfunction , " Burdea said . " Lawyers in the United States could get involved and make that an issue . " He also cited cost as a reason that the devices might not become common in every hospital . Typically , the devices cost a lot because they 're sophisticated new technology that also includes vision and sound technologies . Commercial devices sell for around $55,000 at least , and $100,000 is a common price , he said . <p> On the other hand , many applications today already rely on force feedback . Surgeons typically train on simulators that include the sense of touch , to simulate cutting through bone or to simulate navigating a medical device through the body , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaithersburg , Md. , a branch of Immersion Corp . Nurses and technicians learn how to give shots or insert IVs by using a company device that simulates the resistance of flesh as it is punctured . The simulator can be set to replicate a baby 's skin , for example , or skin thickness on different parts of the body . <p> The advent of minimally invasive surgery has lent itself to developing many of the newer haptic medical training devices , Stacy said . For instance , another Immersion Medical simulator replicates the feeling of guiding an endoscope through a patient 's colon . The endoscope is a long tube with a camera on the end that sends pictures of the bowel to a physician 's computer as he guides it . <p> " A key part of navigating the medical devices is what the surgeon or physician is feeling , " Stacy said . " When they push the endoscope , it 's not a straight shot . They have to navigate around a variety of curves , and the bowel is moving and constricting . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more realistic . " <p> Early medical simulator development - and by early , Stacy means the first half of the 1990s - was hampered by the cost of computing power , which has since declined greatly , of course , in part due to Moore 's law . <p> " As the cost has come down , we 've been able to achieve real-time haptic feedback and link it with graphics , so we can provide a real experience for physicians and surgeons that looks and feels like the real procedure , " he said . <p> Some Immersion Corp . devices are finding their way into unique applications , like the Idrive in the BMW 7-Series . It is a means of controlling various functions , from tuning the radio to turning up the heat . <p> Immersion 's vice president of sales and marketing , Joseph DiNucci , said the device should be thought of as a mouse that navigates the electromechanical systems in the car . Users may activate the Idrive and then scroll from left to right to adjust balance in the stereo speakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ticks in the drive as they dial , as if the device were mechanical , to guide them as they tune in a station . <p> The role of haptics is in the intuitive feedback that drivers learn to recognize as they use the device while driving , DiNucci said . <p> Hollerbach of the University of Utah said the future looks bright for haptics . The new generation of haptic interfaces growing at academic institutions today needs to make its way into the commercial realm , he said . " There are some decent devices in the marketplace , but there are some more that would really revolutionize the field if they were commercialized , " he said . " And that 's something that will happen in the next few years . Of course , always there 's the question of what the market will accept in terms of this type of commercialization . " Hollerbach expects the haptic drive , like the one already in use on the BMW , to find greater application in all cars , no matter what their cost . <p> Burdea predicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close . <p> " We 're revolutionizing the technology now , " he said . " As more companies commercialize it , the price will come down , too . " <p> Haptic devices that fit the hand , like the one sold by Immersion Corp . ( top ) , <p> The force-feedback glove developed at Rutgers ( bottom ) give the wearer a sense of touch , as if one is actually squeezing a ball or tracing an object . <p> The Rutgers ankle ( top ) simulates walking over different types of terrain , for patients undergoing physical therapy . <p> Haptics can simulate assembling a part ( above ) to ensure that it Is designed for easy construction . <p> By Jean Thilmany <p>
