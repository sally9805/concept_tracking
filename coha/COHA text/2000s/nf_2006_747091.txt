School psychology university trainers confront a significant and increasing challenge in attempting to deliver essential content at the graduate specialist level without adding course requirements to an already demanding and lengthy curriculum . Training in counseling is one example of a domain valued by faculty and practitioners that by necessity represents a small area of concentration within specialist programs , often comprised only of two or three survey courses without a supervised practicum experience . This multiple baseline , across subjects , study with school psychology trainees suggests that more attention to the potential of self-instruction modules may provide some direction to address the challenge . Results , consistent with an earlier investigation with special education teachers , indicated positive change in specific skills and overall performance with all content delivered outside of typical classroom setting . <p> School psychology training is demanding , both for graduate students and for the programs themselves . In the Standards for Training and Field Placement Programs in School Psychology , the National Association of School Psychologists ( NASP ) requires programs to demonstrate that students , " . have a foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories , models , empirical findings , and techniques in each domain . " ( NASP , 2002 , p. 1648 ) . Operationally defined , this translates into 11 separate domains of professional practice covering important theory and methods from the fields of both education and psychology . Brown and Minke ( 1986 ) provide an alternative illustration that describes the diversity of content addressed in school psychology graduate programs . Brown and Minke defined 26 dependent variables , such as assessment of intelligence , assessment of learning problems , education general , education exceptional , neuropsychology , and psychotherapeutic intervention , which were used to describe the content covered through graduate coursework . In short , the expertise required of beginning school psychologists is as diverse as the roles they will play in their professional practices . It is an ongoing challenge for graduate programs to offer training experiences that are relevant , theoretically rigorous , and provide sufficient hands-on experiences that prepare students to practice ethically and successfully . <p> Adding to the challenges to quality graduate education is the relatively brief duration of non-doctoral school psychology programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the specialist-level , 56 of which must be unrelated to the internship ( NASP , 2002 ) . Though this sounds like a large number of credits , potential weaknesses in specialist-level training become evident when comparing requirements between non-doctoral and doctoral programs . The NASP requires that doctoral-level programs consist of at least 90 credit hours , 78 of which are exclusive of the doctoral supervised internship . Doctoral level programs tend to utilize the additional course requirements to provide more training and knowledge base related to several school psychological services , including psychotherapeutic interventions , school-based consultation , consultation , and assessment ( Brown &; Minke , 1986 , Reschly &; Wilson , 1997 ) . <p> The necessity for school psychology to evolve into a doctoral specialty is a subject of ongoing debate and is beyond the scope of this article . For the time being , demographic research suggests that school psychology is primarily , though not exclusively , a non-doctoral profession . Practitioner surveys involving national samples have consistently found that approximately 70 to 80 percent of practitioners currently hold a Master 's or Educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis , et al. , 1999 ; Curtis , Hunley , &; Chesno Grier , 2002 ; Loe &; Miranda , 2005 ) and that approximately 70 percent of graduate students are enrolled in programs offering the Master 's or Educational Specialist degree ( Reschly &; Wilson , 1997 ) . These data strongly suggest that specialist-level programs will continue to be the prevalent model for training school psychologists , at least over the short term . <p> A primary advantage of the non-doctoral terminal training is its efficiency . Specialist-level programs can be completed over a much shorter period of time , resulting in less potential expense incurred by students and a broader pool of practitioners more rapidly available to meet the demand for psychological services in the schools . In exchange for efficiency , the specialist-level model trades depth of training experiences in more specialized domains , and school psychology trainers face a continuing challenge to deliver essential content without adding course requirements to an already demanding curriculum . <p> The counseling domain , for example , provides an especially clear example of a content area in which trainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling domain appears to be highly valued among faculty but , by necessity , represents a small area of concentration within specialist-level programs . Students are commonly required to take only two or three survey courses without a supervised practicum experience ( Sinclair , 1997 ) . <p> This is an important issue for school psychology trainers to consider given that approximately 80 percent of school psychologists provide counseling services to students ( Curtis , Hunley , Walker , &; Baker , 1999 ) . Though counseling is not the primary service provided by school psychologists ( Brown , Swigart , Bolen , Hall , and Webster , 1998 ; Bramlett , Murphy , Johnson , Wallingsford , &; Hall , 2002 ) , practitioners and teachers have long expressed interest in increasing the prominence of this role ( Gilman &; Gabriel , 2004 ; Reschly &; Wilson , 1995 ; Hosp &; Reschly , 2002 ) . <p> One approach to providing increased training in domains such as counseling without extending the length of the specialist program would be for trainers to reconsider our operational definitions . As trainers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of creating new courses , neglecting the potential of required self-instruction . While this possibility would appear to be obvious , the literature on self-instruction for graduate training in school psychology is strangely silent . <p> In contrast , self-instructional modules have long been used by counselor educators to teach specific skills to graduate students . Counselor educators have applied a variety of self-instructional training modules to teach or improve trainees ' basic skills . Examples include confrontation skills ( Rosenthal , 1977 ) , paraphrasing ( Robinson &; Kinnier , 1988 ) , interviewing skills ( Veltum , &; Miltenberger , 1989 ) , and the ability to formulate clinical hypotheses ( Krupius , Benjamin , &; Morran , 1985 ) . <p> In describing the use of self-instructional modules for counselor training , Cormier and Cormier ( 1976 ) define the modules as instructional units that contain learning objectives , evaluation procedures , and learning activities that do not require the presence of an instructor to execute . The establishment of learning objectives involves the definition of specific skills to be acquired , a level of mastery performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learner should perform the skills . Evaluation procedures consist of self-assessments that allow learners to track their acquisition of target skills . Learning activities consist of self-directed exercises designed to assist learners in the acquisition of the concepts and skills specified in the learning objectives . Specific learning activities can vary widely and can involve reading , writing , and role-playing . Modules provide learners with modeling for the target skills , opportunities for practice , and immediate feedback about performance . <p> Although a variety of applications have been suggested , the available research that has examined the efficacy of self-instructional modules for teaching counseling skills is limited with regard to both the number of studies and the lack of replication for specific counseling skills . These data , however , do suggest that self-instructional modules may have the potential to teach discrete , basic counseling skills , even when trainees have limited or no prior knowledge base in counseling theories and methods . <p> Particularly promising were the findings in a study by Crank , Schumaker , &; Deshler ( 1990 ) in which self-instructional methodology was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior training in counseling . Without direct instruction the participants completed self-instruction activities in core counseling relationship and problem-solving skills . These skills included active listening , clarifying , and communicating empathy , as well as a specific problem solving approach using target identification , specifying alternatives , weighing the alternatives , and role playing their use . A multiple baseline across-subjects design was used to test the effects of the program with two sets of three subjects . Participants completed simulated counseling sessions prior and subsequent to the self-instruction . Ratings of the sessions indicated a marked increase in use of appropriate skills after the self-instruction . The participants reported a positive response to the self-training and that the skills had generalized to actual use with students in their classrooms . A need for research to assess the generalizability of the findings in different settings and with different types of participants was noted by the authors of the study . <p> To date , no research has examined the use of self-instructional modules to teach basic counseling skills to school psychology students . If the efficacy of the modules can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology students and trainers . Students could use them as an extension of introductory coursework in counseling theories and methods to begin to develop tangible basic skills that can be developed under direct supervision during internship . For school psychology training programs , self-instructional modules represent an opportunity to extend counseling skills training without adding course or practicum requirements to already demanding specialist-level programs . <p> This study extends the seminal work by Crank , Schumaker , &; Deshler ( 1990 ) with a study to determine whether their general approach would also be effective with pre-service school psychologists with materials adapted to be consistent with counseling models ( e.g. Sklare , 1997 ) now prevalent in school-based counseling practice . Method <p> Participants <p> Both participants in this self-instruction study were females with master 's degrees in special education . Both are employed as special education teachers with approximately six years of teaching experience . Both are first year students in the specialist degree program in school psychology . Neither participant had completed any graduate coursework in counseling . <p> Participants were informed prior to the study that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish baseline skills , followed by completion of a self-instruction notebook , and then conducting two or three additional simulated counseling sessions . Successful completion of the study and a follow-up seminar served as a substitute for one of the required counseling courses . <p> Procedure <p> Each participant conducted five simulated individual counseling sessions in a multiple baseline across- subjects design . The setting in which the sessions occurred was a university office commonly used for advisement and counseling . The participants studied the self-instruction materials in settings of their choice , typically in their homes . <p> The participant identified as Case A did two sessions prior to receiving the self-instruction materials and three after completing the materials . Case B did three sessions in the baseline condition . Within the baseline and self-instruction conditions , the simulated counseling sessions were scheduled at weekly intervals . <p> Counseling simulations . Two female graduate assistants played the roles of adolescent clients for the simulated counseling sessions . One graduate assistant was a second year student in the specialist degree program in school psychology ; the other was a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling . Both had previously completed a graduate course in counseling that included experience in role playing . <p> For this study five scenarios were selected from materials used in the original surface-counseling study ( Crank , Schumaker , &; Deshler , 1990 ) . Appropriateness and authenticity of the scenarios was provided through review by a panel with expertise in delivery of counseling . Two involved problems in the home setting : an abusive parent and concern about mother 's live-in boyfriend . One involved an academic issue , failing grade in a biology class . One involved a sibling 's drug use , and the theme of other was distress about break-up in a relationship . All were problem situations that a practitioner might encounter in a school setting . Each was different from practice scenarios included in the self-instruction materials . To illustrate , one of the scenarios including instructions given for the role playing is included as Appendix A. <p> Prior to the study , the two student assistants who played the role of a distressed adolescent received copies of the scenarios and were briefed about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each session they should follow the lead of the counselor , neither assisting nor interfering with the flow . The assistants then scheduled the sessions with the participants , alternating the order of participant-assistant dyads . Sessions were conducted in a university lab and videotaped for subsequent ratings . No feedback was provided to the participant following a session . All sessions were completed during the Fall 2004 semester . The two student assistants and the two research participants were unknown to one another prior to the onset of the study . <p> Self-instruction module . The primary counseling model used in the program is identified as diagnostic and prescriptive counseling strategies . The model is " diagnostic " in use of core relationship skills and probing questions to define the problem and identify the conditions that created it and are serving to maintain it . It is " prescriptive " in that counseling sessions are expected to end with a mutually acceptable and specific plan of action for problem resolution . For this study the model served as an envelope for training materials based on the Surface Counseling program developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supplemented by techniques associated with solution-focused ( Sklare , 1997 ) and single-session ( Talmon , 1994 ) counseling . <p> In a loose-leaf notebook , the self-instruction module included : <p>  --  An overview of the diagnostic and prescriptive counseling strategies model with instructions for use of the self-instruction materials . <p>  --  A section on relationship building skills that was essentially identical to the surface counseling materials . <p>  --  A section on problem solving steps with the surface counseling materials edited to incorporate solution-focused strategies in the context of delivery by a practitioner other than a teacher ( the perspective in the original materials ) . <p>  --  Appendices with examples of dialogues using the approach , scenarios for practice sessions , answer keys for end of section questions , and self-evaluation checklists . <p>  --  An audio tape of a session illustrating use of the approach . <p> Participants were given a self-instruction notebook following completion of their baseline sessions . Each was encouraged to carefully go through all of the materials , take the self-tests at the end of the relationship building and problem solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notebook and the self-evaluation checklist to practice the counseling approach before the next scheduled session . They were informed that use of the approach would be expected in the subsequent sessions . <p> Following the baseline sessions , a participant had two weeks with the self-instruction notebooks before the next session . Consistent with the self-instruction concept , participant use of the notebook was not monitored . They were not required to submit their self-evaluation checklists or their answers to the basic content questions with assumption that impact of the self-instruction materials would be reflected in subsequent simulated counseling sessions . Participants were told that they could ask questions about how to use the materials but could not ask for clarification of the content itself until the follow-up seminar after all sessions were completed . <p> Instrumentation <p> A scale to rate the effectiveness of the participants ' performance in each simulated counseling session was adapted from the scale used in the original surface-counseling study ( Crank , Schumaker , &; Deshler , 1990 ) . On the adapted scale , raters made binary determinations for 11 behaviors associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem solving model . Relationship skills were in categories of nonverbal and verbal encouragement , posture , and reflective statements . Problem solving skills were in categories of obtaining specific information , role playing , summary statements , and session closure . <p> In addition to the binary ratings of specific behaviors , the adapted scale included an overall rating of performance effectiveness in the session on a 5-point Likert scale . A copy of the adapted rating scale is included as Appendix B. <p> Inter-rater reliability data for the adapted scale were obtained through independent ratings of each participant 's initial counseling session and each participant 's first session after self-instruction . One of the two raters was also a simulated client in the study . The other rater was a doctoral student in the school counselor education program who had no other participation in the study . Before receiving the videotapes , each rater participated in a brief training session to insure commonality in definitions of the specific behaviors included on the scale . Both raters had completed graduate counseling courses . <p> The specific behaviors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four sessions ) opportunities for agreement . The independent ratings were identical on 91 of the 112 behaviors , an 81 percent agreement level . There was also remarkable consistency in the ratings of overall session effectiveness . Three of the four sessions received identical scores by each rater using the 5-point scale . On the only session where there was a difference , one rater assigned a three and the other assigned a four for the overall effectiveness in that session . <p> Treatment Integrity <p> Treatment integrity refers to the degree to which an independent variable , in this case the self-instruction in counseling , is implemented by participants as intended ( Yeaton &; Sechrest , 1981 ) . Monitoring the implementation in a self-instruction context is somewhat problematic , but some data in support of the integrity was provided in the participant 's post-intervention responses during the counseling sessions and in discussion with the participants when the study was concluded . Results <p> Before training , the mean scores in relationship skills and problem solving skills for the participant identified as Case A were 27% and 12% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85% and 90% . The participant identified as Case B 's pre-training mean scores in relationship skills and problem solving were 85% and 53% , respectively . The corresponding scores subsequent to use of the self-instruction module were 95% and 85% . <p> On the total of all rated skills , Case A demonstrated 18% prior to the self-instruction and 88% after completing the self-instruction module . Corresponding scores for Case B were 65% and 89% . Together the two participants demonstrated a mean of 42% of the essential skills during the baseline prior to self-instruction and 89% subsequent to self-instruction . <p> Ratings of specific desired behaviors across conditions for the two participants are illustrated in Figure 1 as percentages of demonstrated relationship skills , demonstrated problem solving skills , and a total combing the two . The results for Case A are clearly supportive of impact of the self-instruction materials with a marked increase in demonstration of both relationship and problem solving skills after the self-instruction module was introduced . <p> Although neither participant had prior formal training in counseling , the participant identified as Case B clearly entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not increase after the self-instruction module was introduced . There was a slight elevation in slope of the problem solving skills following the self-instruction module , but an upward trend was already evident . <p> The pattern of overall effectiveness ratings on the 5-point Likert scale is illustrated in Figure 2 . Particularly noteworthy in these data is that by the fourth session , her second session after the self-instruction , the participant identified as Case A had caught up with the other participant with both receiving identical and high ratings on the final two sessions . Discussion <p> There are a number of cautions in generalization of these findings . Only two participants were eligible for this study , and they may not have been representative of the typical graduate student in a specialist level program . Neither reported any formal training " in counseling " , but both are public school teachers and some training in human relationship and or problem solving skills could have been embedded in other courses . Despite every attempt to create as natural a situation as possible , these were simulated counseling sessions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple baseline approach provided only soft signs of a direct cause-effect relationship between the self-instruction module and the evident improvement over the course of the study . <p> With those cautions noted , these data clearly support additional study of the viability of self-instruction as a tool to mediate the demands for increasing content in university training programs . There was a dramatic change in the performance of the participant identified as Case A corresponding to the introduction of the self-instruction content . The participant identified as Case B was demonstrating strong relationship skills and some use of the problem solving skills even before the self-instruction module , but her overall level of performance in both improved subsequent to the self-instruction . <p> For both participants , these data suggest that opportunities for continued and motivated practice may be an essential ingredient in application of self-instruction as the delivery modality for critical content in the training of school psychologists . Both participants continued to improve in subsequent sessions following their use of the self-instruction materials . <p> In the post-study seminar , both participants expressed satisfaction with the self-instruction approach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its use . Limitations noted included the focus in the materials on adolescents with questions about how the approach would be used with younger children . They also noted that not receiving external feedback after each session was uncomfortable . <p> Research studies with additional participants are needed to insure that the growth evident with these participants was not idiosyncratic . Studies to assess the extent to which these skills remain intact over time will also be important . Research to determine if there are other content areas in the training of school psychologists conducive to self-instruction also appears warranted by these results . <p> In this study , a self-instruction approach previously validated ( Crank , Schumaker , &; Deshler , 1990 ) for delivery of essential counseling content for use by teachers appears with some adaptation to be effective for pre-service school psychologists as well . While granting the need for additional study before implementing this approach in training program , it is worth noting that there is very little empirical data supporting the belief that packaging our content into one semester , two or three-credit courses is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we continue to attempt to address the need to include more and more content into already lengthy training programs , it may now be the time to step back and apply the same standards to our program delivery that we apply to interventions by practitioners . <p> GRAPH : Figure 1 ; Multiple Baseline Percentage of Demonstrated Skills <p> GRAPH : Figure 2 ; Overall Effectiveness Rating <p>
