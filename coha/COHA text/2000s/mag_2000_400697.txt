Computers that tap the bizarre properties of subatomic particles might calculate with awesome speed cracking codes that stymie conventional machines . <p> Every so often , says Isaac Chuang , sitting in his office at IBM 's Almaden Research Center in San Jose , " something new comes along in physics , and everybody says ' Wow ! ' Then they get caught up in a whirlwind . " In the 1970s , the whirlwind was chaos theory . In the late 1980s , it was high-temperature superconductivity . And now ? <p> " Quantum computing " says Chuang , a slender , soft-spoken physicist who has already emerged as one of the leaders in this esoteric-sounding field with potentially enormous impact . <p> A quantum computer operates by the rules of quantum weirdness , down in the subatomic realm where our everyday intuitions are violated wholesale . This is a world in which an electron can be in two places at once , in which an atomic nucleus can be spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time . It is a bizarre world in which matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you try to look at it . <p> And yet this surreal world is one in which you can do computing , insists Chuang , whose group at Almaden is one of several that have demonstrated the basic principles in the lab . If he and his fellow researchers can ever scale up their demonstrations into practical machines , the payoff will be enormous . Quantum computers could tackle problems that would stymie their conventional counterparts  --  easily cracking , for instance , the most sophisticated encryption schemes now in use . <p> Hence the new whirlwind . " It 's easy for quantum computing to sound like a fanciful theorist 's dream " says physicist Neil Gershenfeld of the MIT Media Lab . " But just extrapolating Moore 's Law , the scaling relation that says microchips shrink by a factor of two every two years or so , somewhere around the year 2020 or 2030 is when we hit one bit per atom  --  and when a new semiconductor fabrication plant will cost the gross national product of the planet . So if we really want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . Quantum weirdness is essentially the only resource we have that 's still untapped for computing . It 's the only big thing that 's left in the universe . " A New Kind of Bit <p> Actually , when quantum computing started out , it was a fanciful theorist 's dream  --  the late Richard Feynman 's , most notably . The fatuously whimsical Nobel laureate first started pushing the idea in 1981 , following an earlier suggestion by Argonne National Laboratory physicist Paul Benioff . Others quickly followed Feynman 's lead . And by the time Ike Chuang first encountered quantum computing in the late 1980s , shortly after receiving his undergraduate physics degree from MIT , a cadre of at least half a dozen physicists and computer scientists were actively working in the field . <p> Certainly Chuang was smitten . " I 've always wanted to know what information is in a physical sense  --  and to understand what physics is in terms of information , " he says . Quantum computing seemed like a completely new way to understand them both . <p> Take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is full of yes-no choices that make it downright easy . Most particles  --  including electrons , protons and even the ephemeral packets of light called photons  --  possess a kind of built-in rotary motion known as " spin " So if your subatomic computer used electrons , for example , you could say that an electron spinning in one direction represented a binary 1 , while an electron spinning in the opposite direction represented a 0 . And once you encode the information , says Chuang , the subatomic world also offers any number of ways to process it . By manipulating the magnetic environment of electrons , say , or by routing photons through an array of polarizers , mirrors and beam splitters , you could subject your quantum bits to all the operations required by a digital computer . <p> But there would also be a critical difference . Conventional computers followed the rules of binary logic , governed by an ironclad either-or distinction : Each bit of information is either true or false , on or off , one or zero . To enforce this distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of a few zillion electrons collected in a tiny silicon transistor , so that the zillions are either there or they are not . <p> But once you get down to the level of individual particles , says Chuang , almost nothing is absolute . An electron , for example , could be spinning one way or the other  --  but it could also exist as a kind of mixture of spins . According to the laws of quantum physics , you could say the electron has a probability of spinning one way or the other . But unless you actually made a measurement and forced the issue , you could n't know which it was ; in a sense , the electron itself would be undecided . And that , in turn , means that each bit of quantum information could be undecided . Instead of being either-or , a quantum " qubit " could be both-and : representing 0 and 1 simultaneously . <p> This ambiguity has a powerful consequence that becomes more apparent when you think of not one but two qubits . These qubits could simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 00 ) , ( 01 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) . Add a third qubit and you could have a combination of all possible three-bit numbers : ( 000 ) , ( 001 ) , ( 010 ) , ( 011 ) , ( 100 ) , ( 101 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) . This kind of system scales exponentially : n qubits can stand for 2n numbers at once . Line up a mere 40 qubits , and you could represent every binary number from zero to more than a trillion  --  simultaneously . <p> Furthermore , says Chuang , just as a collection of quantum qubits could represent a huge array of numbers simultaneously , a quantum computer could process every possible input simultaneously  --  the most perfect form of parallel processing imaginable . Given the right kind of problem and a sufficient supply of qubits , a quantum computer could outpace its conventional counterparts by many orders of magnitude . " I read about all this " says Chuang , remembering his first encounter with Feynman 's articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wanted to build a quantum computer . " Algorithm Attack <p> But how ? Feynman and the other theoreticians had focused on quantum computing as a mathematical abstraction  --  and with good reason . " Building a real quantum computer is a viciously difficult task , " says Chuang . Everything depends on making sure the qubits retain their incredibly fragile quantum-mechanical mix of 1 and 0  --  what physicists refer to as staying " coherent . " One bump from a stray air molecule , one twitch in the magnetic field , one ricochet of a random photon , and coherency vanishes . Let that happen in a quantum computer and your qubits will instantly collapse from both-and to either-or  --  meaning that you will suddenly find yourself looking at an ordinary computer full of ordinary Is and Os . <p> " Quantum mechanics goes away when you look at it , " sighs Chuang . " So you have to make sure that the computer is extremely well isolated from the rest of the world . " But the isolation ca n't be total , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the results . " This " Chuang declares , " is the discord that stalks quantum computing . How can you control it if , at the same time , you have to leave it alone ? " <p> As the 1980s became the 1990s , many researchers continued to grapple with the problem . Chuang even made it the subject of his doctoral dissertation at Stanford . But nothing they proposed seemed feasible . And with no compelling application at hand , quantum computing seemed destined for the same cul-de-sac as countless other exotic pieces of science . <p> Two developments  --  one theoretical , one practical  --  have rescued quantum computing from irrelevancy , explains MIT physicist Seth Lloyd . On the theoretical side , it was a factoring algorithm discovered by Peter Shor of AT &T; Research labs  --  an achievement that went right to the heart of modern cryptography/In most current encryption schemes , including those used to send credit-card numbers and other sensitive information across the Internet , an eavesdropper can break the code of a given message only by factoring a very large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school kids learn that 12 = 2 x 2 x 3 . But factoring large numbers is one of the quintessentially hard problems in computer science . No matter how clever the algorithms , in fact , the time required to factor larger and larger numbers grows exponentially . Go beyond a few hundred digits , and even the fastest machines in the world will be overwhelmed : The factoring time will vastly exceed the lifetime of the universe . <p> Or rather , it will with a conventional computer . Shor proved that a quantum computer could factor large numbers in a time that increases only as some power of the numbers ' size  --  rapid growth , to be sure , but not remotely as explosive as exponential growth . Indeed , a conventional computer would need to crank away for billions of years to factor a 400-digit number . A quantum machine could do the job in about a year . The implication was that " unbreakable " codes might now be breakable . And with that announcement , the National Security Agency , the Pentagon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke up to the fact that quantum computing was n't a theorist 's plaything anymore . Peter Shor was holding out the possibility of a real and critically important application . <p> Meanwhile , on the experimental side , quantum computing was beginning to look much more possible in the lab . In 1993 , for example , Lloyd brought the mathematical abstractions down to earth when he showed how quantum computation could be carried out by qubits arranged in a regular array  --  just the kind of quantum computer that might actually get built . Then in 1996 , Chuang and MIT 's Gershenfeld made things even more concrete when they suddenly saw a way to build it . <p> " I went into Ike 's office on a Monday and did n't emerge until Friday , " laughs Gershenfeld , thinking back to the quantum computing conference that brought him to the University of California at Santa Barbara and the Institute for Theoretical Physics , where Chuang had a postdoc appointment . " We got this feeling that comes along only rarely , that there was this beautiful structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing it for the first time . " <p> That structure became apparent as soon as they decided to forget about electrons or photons , and instead make their qubits at the heart of the atom : the nucleus . Actually , it is the nucleus 's building blocks  --  protons and neutrons  --  that have spin . While individual spins tend to pair up and cancel each other out , in some isotopes a few are left over , leaving a net spin in one direction or another . <p> Nuclear qubits were appealing for several reasons . First , you can make a perfectly fine qubit out of any nuclear isotope that has a spin  --  as many do . Second , says Gershenfeld , " this is the most coherent system in the universe . " Every nucleus is protected from outside disturbances by its dense cloud of electrons . That means that once you get its spin lined up , it will stay that way for hours or days  --  an eon in computer time . Third , nuclear qubits are incredibly easy to assemble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we can just use the ones nature gave us : molecules . " Moreover , he points out , the nuclear spins inside a given molecule tend to interact nicely . Take chloroform , for example , a molecule consisting of a carbon atom attached to three chlorine atoms and one hydrogen atom : When the hydrogen nucleus and the carbon nucleus are spinning the same way , their energy levels will be measurably different from when they are spinning opposite from one another . <p> Finally , says Gershenfeld , the technology for manipulating these nuclear spins is already very mature . It 's called nuclear magnetic resonance , or NMR , and it is routinely used in chemical analysis and in hospital magnetic resonance imaging scanners . It 's a simple matter to adapt commercial NMR spectrometers to do quantum computing . <p> Say you want to carry out a logical operation using chloroform  --  something like , " If carbon is 1 , then hydrogen is 0 . " You just suspend the chloroform molecules in a solvent , and put a sample in the spectrometer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you hit the sample with a brief radio-frequency pulse at just the right frequency . The hydrogen spin will either flip or not flip , depending on what the carbon is doing  --  exactly what you want for an if-then operation . By hitting the sample with an appropriately timed sequence of such pulses , moreover , you can carry out an entire quantum algorithm-without ever once having to peek at the nuclear spins and ruin the quantum coherence . <p> So there it was , Chuang and Gershenfeld realized : NMR was a natural for quantum computing . They were not alone . Chuang remembers being " surprised and delighted " to learn that Harvard University NMR expert David Cory and his colleagues were independently making exactly the same proposal . For researchers of Cory 's caliber to enter the field constituted more of an endorsement of the NMR idea than a rivalry , Chuang believed . In any case , there was plenty of work to go around . By this point , Lloyd recalls , with researchers having identified a real application for quantum computing plus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breaking loose " in the field . " All of a sudden there was this wonderful new game to play . " <p> The game has only gotten better . In just the past few years , for example , Shor and others have shown that quantum computers need n't be as fragile as researchers once feared ; a variety of quantum error-correction schemes will allow the devices to undo the damage caused by environmental perturbations and restore their qubits to full coherence . Lov Grover of Lucent Technologies ' Bell Labs has discovered a quantum search algorithm that is substantially faster than its best classical counterpart . Chuang himself has used NMR to demonstrate Grover 's algorithm , first on a two-qubit quantum computer-a chloroform molecule  --  and more recently on a three-qubit molecule . Along the way , Chuang and Gershenfeld 's partnership has expanded into a nationwide consortium for quantum computing research , including members from MIT , Stanford , the University of California at Berkeley , IBM and several other industrial partners . Cory 's team , which is working on an NMR demonstration of Shor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both groups are among those getting money from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  --  the arm of the Defense Department that essentially invented the Internet  --  as part of the first significant federal funding initiative for quantum computing . Making " Magic " <p> None of this means that we 'll be trading in our PCs for quantum laptops anytime soon . Quantum computing is barely into its proof-of-principle stage , with a long way to go before it evolves even to the qubit equivalent of World War II-era vacuum-tube machines like the ENIAC . Much more likely are quantum add-ons to conventional machines  --  " coprocessors " that will perform specific tasks in the same way that a graphics card takes over the most difficult display chores . <p> What exactly those tasks will be , however , is an unsettled question . MIT physicist Edward Farhi points out that the study of quantum algorithms is still in its infancy . The two best ones discovered so far  --  Shor 's and Grover 's  --  will doubtless be followed by many more , opening up applications that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a quantum computer is n't necessarily fast . It 's a device that attacks problems in a different way . We 're still trying to understand what makes a problem amenable to that kind of attack . You have to choose your problem carefully to take advantage of the quantum magic . " <p> In practice , adds Farhi , how quantum coprocessors are used could depend a lot on how much they cost . And that 's a complicated issue . At IBM Almaden , for example , the core of Chuang 's quantum computer is small and inexpensive : qubit-containing molecules dissolved in a few drops of colorless solvent , encased in a glass tube smaller than his little finger . But the NMR spectrometer that makes the computer go is a silvery , 10-foot-tall cylinder surrounded by great thickets of wires and plumbing  --  most of it required to service the liquid helium that chills the spectrometer 's superconducting magnets . If future quantum coprocessors follow this pattern , they will be huge , multimillion-dollar behemoths that fill up whole rooms , and that only governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be restricted to hard-core national security tasks such as cryptography and intelligence-gathering . <p> But such an outsized contraption may not be inevitable . Gershenfeld 's group at the MIT Media Lab is working on a compact , room-temperature NMR computer . They hope this device will be a prototype of a quantum coprocessor that will power inexpensive little gadgets  --  peripherals that will sit on the desktop like a modern-day printer or scanner . If that proves to be the pattern , then we could see a new generation of quantum hackers going to work in much the same way their forebears did at the beginning of the personal computer revolution , creating a profusion of innovative quantum software . <p> In the meantime , however , Chuang and his fellow experimenters are far less concerned with their machines ' physical size than with their qubit count . " The first year we had lots of wonderful one-qubit machines popping up all over the place , " he says . " Now at IBM we have a three-qubit computer , and we 're planning even larger computers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NMR computer , and Chuang is confident that one lab or another will soon be demonstrating molecules with as many as 10 qubits . He concedes that this will be a tricky task , however . " Say I want a molecule with certain properties . When I draw it and go to the chemists , they just laugh : ' That 's not real ! ' They call it a ' physicist 's molecule . ' " One complication is that carbon , the key ingredient of all complex molecules , almost invariably occurs as the isotope carbon-12  --  which is spinless . Chuang 's chloroform computer worked only because its molecules were made with the rare and expensive isotope carbon-13 , which does spin . <p> Yet a truly useful quantum computer will need hundreds or even thousands of qubits . Presumably , says Chuang , that means some kind of long-chain polymer . But developing the right kind of polymer , figuring out how to stabilize it , and then learning how to do NMR with it  --  that all adds up to many more years of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quantum computing  --  a prospect that is no more guaranteed than that vacuum tubes were the final answer for conventional electronic computers . Ultimately , a practical quantum device might take some other form entirely . In the " ion trap " approach , for example , the qubits are ionized atoms suspended in an oscillating electric field . This approach has proved fiendishly difficult to implement , despite some preliminary success by physicist Christopher R. Monroe and his team at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder , Colo . But if the ion trap idea ever pans out , it will be a remarkably clean and elegant system to program . Alternatively , there are " quantum dots " in which the qubits would be electrons trapped in an array of tiny structures etched onto the surface of a silicon crystal ( see " Quantum Dot Corn , " TR January/February 2000 ) . Then there is the liquid crystal approach , the crystal lattice approach-on and on . <p> The myriad possibilities are limited only by your imagination , says Gershenfeld  --  which is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This has the feel of being a whole new science , " he declares . " Computer scientists are having to learn physics , and that does n't quite fit into their intellectual framework . Physicists are having to learn computer science , and that does n't quite fit into their framework . Quantum computing breaks down the institutional boundaries at almost any institution you can name . And every side is the richer for learning a new language for describing the world . " <p> But perhaps an even deeper reason for the excitement is the way quantum computing expands our intellectual horizons . " I 'm not just doing this for the sake of quantum computing , " says Chuang . " I 'm doing it because so little is known about computing in general . For 50 years we 've just focused on one technique in computing " : that is , microchips based on the on-off dichotomy of binary logic . The pursuit of quantum computing , Chuang believes , addresses a fundamental issue : " What does it take to perform a computation-and how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? That is the more basic question that quantum computing brings out .
