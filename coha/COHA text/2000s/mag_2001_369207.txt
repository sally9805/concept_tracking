Even before he was declared President-elect , George W. Bush had become bear in chief . For weeks he 's been warning that the U.S. economy is in for hard times . He may steer clear himself of the term recession . " Possible slowdown " is one way he puts it . But dirty work is what Vice Presidents are for . So Dick Cheney has been sent out to say the forbidden word . As early as Dec. 3 , he was on Meet the Press warning that the nation " may well be on the front edge of a recession . " <P> Why would Bush be willing to spook the economy he 's about to inherit ? For starters , he needs to spread the idea that if things get tight for a while , the problem started before he took office . The last recession occurred during his father 's presidency . He does n't want the next one called Bush 2 . But he also hopes to use the prospect of trouble ahead as a rationale for his proposal to cut taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said last month , " A tax-relief plan for everybody serves as an insurance policy against a potential economic downturn . " <P> It was to underline his worries about a downturn that Bush scheduled his economic forum in Austin , Texas , this week , a round table with selected economists to get their take on things . Though they are n't likely to say so at the forum , one worry many economists have is that Bush 's warnings will become a self-fulfilling prophecy , trash talking a wobbly economy right off the rails . <P> Then again , he and Cheney are just enlarging on what everybody is already thinking  --  that even if we can avoid a real recession , meaning two consecutive quarters in which the economy shrinks , a slowdown in the rapid growth of the ' 90s is plainly in store . The dwindling NASDAQ says it all . If those sputtering dotcoms are the economic engines of the future , then the future 's just not what it used to be . <P> Bush 's bearishness may also reflect the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve governor has been sour for so long on the economy 's prospects that he cashed out all his stocks in 1997 , when the Dow Jones average was still at 8,500 . And for Lindsey , a dedicated supply sider , the remedy for recession just happens to be a tax cut . Most economists insist , however , that tax cuts have very little effect on recessions , largely because their benefits kick in too late to affect the problem . To pre-empt his critics , Bush could redesign his proposal to provide accelerated benefits . One possibility being discussed among his advisers would be to change the formula by which payroll taxes are withheld , as his father did in 1992 . That would put extra cash in taxpayer pockets quickly . <P> Another reason the Bush tax cut may not have much impact is that its biggest parts , like across-the-board rate reductions , are the ones least likely to sail through a sharply divided Congress . And the pieces that are easiest to pass , like an end to the marriage penalty for joint filers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Democrats have accepted the inevitability of some kind of tax reduction 's passing Congress this year . House minority leader Dick Gephardt has already said so . But none of them is prepared to support cuts of the size that Bush is looking for . Meanwhile , they are casting around among smaller-scale ideas .
