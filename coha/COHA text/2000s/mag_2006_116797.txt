UNDER A BLIZZARD of silver confetti , in what had become a mosh pit on the field at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday night , arguably the greatest athlete in the world seemed overwhelmed by the moment . " Unbelievable , " Lance Armstrong , clad in a burnt-orange T-shirt repeated , over and over . " This is just unbelievable . " ? Or was it ? When a player is as transcendent , as ridiculously dominant as Texas quarterback Vince Young was against the USC Trojans , and when a Pete Carroll -- coached defense is made to look like so many cardinal-and-gold pylons , the Longhorns ' breathtaking 41-38 victory is easily believable . What strained credulity was that with 6:42 left and USC leading by 12 points , the clearly outplayed Trojans might actually win . // But as Longhorns right tackle Justin Blalock said while celebrating on the field , not far from where Armstrong posed for pictures with a gaggle of Texas cheerleaders , " We kept our poise , put the ball in Vince 's hands and let the man do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of Heisman Trophy winners , amassing 467 yards of total offense . He completed 30 of 40 passes for 267 yards and ran 19 times for 200 yards and three touchdowns . His last carry , on fourth-and-five from the USC eight-yard line with 19 seconds to play , went for the touchdown that clinched the Longhorns ' first national title in 35 years . It also terminated the two-time defending champion Trojans ' winning streak at 34 games , extending Texas 's to 20 , and left a loquacious man at a temporary loss for words . " I 've been planning this speech for 33 years , " coach Mack Brown told his players in the winners ' locker room , " but right now I do n't really know what to say . " // Hoisting the crystal national championship trophy was sweet vindication for Brown , whose charm and kind nature had become , in an odd way , a curse . He has long been one of the best , if not ( sorry , Pete ) the best recruiter in college football . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew attention to the fact that in eight years at Texas , he 'd never won even a Big 12 title . Critics sniped that he was better in the living rooms of high school seniors than on the sidelines in big games . He was dubbed Coach February . // Brown had no way of knowing it at the time , but his fortunes changed in 2002 -- on the day he sold Young , then a senior at Houston 's Madison High , on the Longhorns . Parade magazine 's national high school offensive player of the year , Young was a scintillating runner and a strong-armed passer despite an awkward throwing motion , and he played his best when the stakes were highest . Upon arriving in Austin in the summer of ' 02 , Young was still a raw talent who had much to learn from Brown and was , in fact , red-shirted . But make no mistake , Texas won its fourth national title on Wednesday night because Brown 's relationship with his star quarterback had become a two-way street : The teacher learned a thing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hair was nearly dry a half hour after the game when Brown remarked , as much to himself as anyone , " It 's a long way from Dallas . " Five straight losses to Oklahoma from 2000 through ' 04 , all in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas , overshadowed otherwise excellent Texas seasons and threatened to define Brown 's career . Each of those defeats was marked by a discernible tightness passed from the coaches to the players , a fear of failure . Young 's career as a Longhorn can be viewed in part as a battle to overcome this constrictive atmosphere -- a battle he officially won last season , when Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis gave up trying to fix his three-quarter throwing motion and attempting to transform him into a sprint-out , bootleg quarterback . They gave Young more latitude away from the field as well , signing off on his request to liven up the locker room and practices with song and dance -- and we 're not talking Lawrence Welk . Young even got Brown , 54 , to loosen up by exposing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickname from the team 's beat writers : Snoop Mack . // Still , heading into the Rose Bowl , the big question was , Which Young would show up ? The brooding passer who in the regular-season finale against Texas A&amp;M was pressing in the face of a surprisingly stiff challenge ? The Heisman runner-up with the chip on his shoulder , who voiced his displeasure over not winning the trophy moments after Reggie Bush 's name was called ? Or the fist-knocking , loose-limbed team leader whose dazzling physical skills are matched by his toughness and strength of will ? // The answer came during pregame warmups , as Brown grooved to the beat of Justin Timberlake 's Rock Your Body . The guy could not have been less tense . Even after the Trojans turned a fumble by Longhorns punt returner Aaron Ross into an early 7-0 lead , Texas had no reason to panic . Though they were scoreless on their first three possessions , the Longhorns were moving the ball . Then , on USC 's first possession of the second quarter , the game turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , Bush attempted an ill-advised lateral as he was about to be tackled inside the Texas 20 . The ball missed its target and was recovered by the Longhorns . Texas turned that goof into a field goal and proceeded to dominate the rest of the first half . Taking advantage of USC 's utter befuddlement in the face of the Longhorns ' zone-read option offense , Young effortlessly completed short and intermediate passes to his underneath receivers behind superb protection , leading Texas on two touchdown drives . Just before intermission Mario Danelo kicked a 43-yard field goal to pull USC to 16-10 , but the Trojans knew they had a game on their hands ; the Longhorns were nothing like the 2004 Oklahoma Sooners , who had rolled over before halftime in last year 's 55-19 Orange Bowl rout . // In truth the signs had been good for Texas ever since the team arrived in Los Angeles on Dec. 28 . " I 've heard about the Vince Vibe , " USC defensive end Lawrence Jackson said . " He 's got those guys really playing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young was relaxed , funny , in the moment . He even played the diplomat , walking over to a group of USC players and breaking the ice at Disneyland , where the teams had been milling about in separate areas before being set loose in the park . And he was a goodwill ambassador , declaring at points throughout the week his love for Brown , Davis , his teammates , the Rose Bowl committee and the weather -- this before Old Testament -- like rain lashed floats and filled fl ? gelhorns in the 117th Rose Parade . // While 2004 Heisman winner Matt Leinart may have enjoyed a reputation as the better passer going into the game -- he would complete 29 of 40 passes for 365 yards -- Young was far and away the most effective leader of the two . This was the guy who in August , along with junior tailback Selvin Young , studied videotape of preseason practices and the next day got in the face of any teammate who had n't been pulling his weight . Vince is also the guy who in the huddle at Missouri in October , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , told his linemen , " All I need is enough time to make three or four sandwiches . " ( After biding his time in the pocket for a while , Young scrambled 34 yards for a first down . ) Cracking a joke , or inspiring , cajoling and bullying teammates comes easily . " It 's pretty much my calling , " he explained . " You accept that calling , or you get smacked in the face by the Man upstairs . " // While USC was uniformly respectful of the Longhorns in the run-up to the Rose Bowl , some Trojans had been annoyed by the bravado emanating from Austin . For those who were n't , the USC coaches left clippings of stories containing the remarks on a table in the lounge of the football office , including a New York Post article whose headline was a Young quote : WE 'LL BEAT USC . Young had turned in a particularly memorable performance at a Dec. 5 press conference , first lobbying for the Heisman , then announcing that should he fail to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world they made the wrong decision . " Asked if he would be intimidated by USC , Young laughed , then replied , " Intimidated by what ? " A moment later he noted that the Trojans " have n't seen the different guys on our team who are gangster . " So compelling did Carroll find these comments that he arranged for snippets from the press conference to be shown during a team meeting . // Most USC players were perplexed rather than angered by the gangster remark . If they had known him better , they would have realized that it was just Vince being Vince -- following his calling , reminding his teammates that they had nothing to fear , that they belonged in the national championship game . The difference between the ' 05 Longhorns and the ' 04 Sooners , he said , was that Oklahoma quarterback Jason White had failed to " keep the guys going . " While White had allowed the Sooners to surrender , Young implied , he would keep Texas in the game by the force of his will . // And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as mobile as R2D2 ; a dazzling double threat , Young was aptly described by Carroll as " Randall Cunningham , only faster . " // After the game on Wednesday night Carroll said that he had never coached against a player as totally commanding as Young had been . " He probably made us miss a dozen tackles tonight , " Carroll said . In truth , that estimate seemed low by at least a dozen . // Six days before the game USC offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin sat in one of the team 's conference rooms , where the names , heights and weights of Texas 's defensive starters were printed on a marker board . " Look at their secondary , " he marveled . " They go 205 , 205 , 205 , 200 . It 's amazing how alike they are , and they can all flat-out run . " Then he made a prediction : " By the time these 11 guys are done with college , I bet nine of them will be in the NFL. " // The most talented player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former All --  Big 12 sprinter who started 49 of 50 games in his four seasons and scored five touchdowns , four on interceptions , one on a fumble return . Co -- defensive coordinator Duane Akina has described him as the smartest , most instinctive player he has ever coached . One of the worst-kept secrets of the week was that Huff , the Jim Thorpe Award winner as the nation 's top defensive back , would bear primary responsibility for containing Bush . It was almost eerie , how at peace Huff appeared to be with that matchup , how much he seemingly -- could this be possible ?  - -  looked forward to it . Asked if anyone on the Longhorns ' roster could keep up with number 5 , he replied , " Yeah . Me. " // Save for a spectacular 26-yard , fourth-quarter touchdown run on which he dived into the end zone , Bush took a backseat to LenDale White , whose thunderous inside runs ( he rushed for 124 yards and three touchdowns ) , coupled with Leinart 's precision passing , got the Trojans back into the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never punted . But on fourth-and-one at the Texas 45 with 2:13 left , Carroll opted to go for it . Gain one yard , win the game . " We just blitzed everyone , " Huff , who helped stuff White inches shy , said later . Young would have one final chance . // After he moved the Longhorns 48 yards in nine plays , the 2005 college football season came down to a single snap . Out of the shotgun Young looked to pass . " I went all the way through my progression , " he recalled later , " but there was nobody open . " Linebacker Collin Ashton and corner Josh Pinkard blitzed , but they were picked up by the Texas front , which did n't allow a sack all night . " The defensive lineman was giving me the edge "  - -  that was Frostee Rucker , who dived vainly at Young 's ankles --  " so I took it down . " // Young took the ball down , then he took the Trojans down . // Leaving the press conference as a losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carroll smiled and asked , " What are you gon na do ? " // Disappearing down the corridor , he flashed USC 's familiar two-fingered salute . It is intended to symbolize V , for victory . On this night , the V stood for something else .
