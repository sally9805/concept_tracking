Yes , America , there was a Mimi , a teenage cuddle for President John Kennedy back in 1962 and ' 63 . But there was also a Pam , a Priscilla , a Jill ( actually , two of them ) , a Janet , a Kim , a Mary and a Diana I can think of offhand . <P> The Kennedy sex industry will march on . Sharing the sheets with J.F.K. seems to have become a badge of honor  --  and perhaps a route to publishing riches . But beware of boasting or true confessions : I 've never met anybody who was a witness in the bedroom . It is all circumstantial  --  or was , until Judith Exner , the Mob moll who wrote it down and changed everything . <P> Mimi Beardsley rings a bell for all of us creaky White House journalists , but it is easy to forget one or more of the young nymphs . They were once described by an astounded British visitor as being like new tennis balls with the fuzz still on them . <P> Mimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House corridors , looking for a desk and something to do that did not require shorthand or typing or any other known secretarial skill . How a senior at Miss Porter 's School captivated a swinging and sophisticated President is a mystery not yet solved  --  or perhaps it is . J.F.K. was captivated pretty easily . Testimony by some of Kennedy 's girls is that he was a lousy and hurried lover , but who cared when it was the leader of the free world , with all the trappings of power like Air Force One and the Lincoln Bedroom ? <P> So Mimi now is Marion Fahnestock , mother of two , grandmother of four , and a church lady with the tony Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City . Actually , many of Kennedy 's girls have done well : wives , mothers , grandmothers , authors , painters , philanthropists , social workers , and there is even one who became a noted Hollywood impresario . <P> Mimi surfaced in a roundabout way . At the Kennedy Library , author Robert Dallek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life , came across an oral history done in 1964 by one of the gentlest , most ardent Kennedy supporters in existence , Barbara Gamarekian . In it Gamarekian , who had worked in the White House press office and later became a reporter for the New York Times , talks about Mimi ; but she had embargoed that section of her reminiscences . Dallek persuaded her to release it . <P> At first , the old White House reporters had a hard time recalling Mimi . But at a monthly luncheon last week , we pieced together sightings of her slipping out of Air Force One and confirmed Gamarekian 's account of the top of a female head being seen in one of the limousines in Kennedy 's motorcade at the 1962 Bermuda summit with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . When staff and reporters looked in , Mimi was sitting on the floor of the car like a child playing hide-and-seek .
