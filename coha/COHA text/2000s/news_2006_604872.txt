<p> DUBAI , United Arab Emirates  --  On the first day of the firestorm involving Dubai 's purchase of a global port management company , I phoned my friend Rashid al-Oraimi , opinion editor at Al Ittihad , a government-owned newspaper of the United Arab Emirates , to discuss the fierce reaction in the USA . No problem , Rashid said . The deal would go through " because Abu Abdullah OK 'd it . " <p> Who is Abu Abdullah ? I asked . <p> " George Bush , of course , " my friend answered , laughing , explaining that Abu Abdullah is the nickname given Bush in the inner circles of the Persian Gulf region . <p> Funny indeed , but as it turned out it 's the wrong answer in this case . <p> President Bush 's OK  --  whether by his hand or by people who work for him matters not  --  was n't enough to seal the deal for Dubai Ports World 's acquisition of London-based Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co . ( P &O),; which runs port operations in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DP World found itself facing a wave of opposition from members of Congress , the longshoremen 's union , and nearly seven out of every 10 Americans , according to various polls . The objections were based on Dubai 's dubious status as a free port , a money-laundering haven and a magnet for huge Iranian investments , trade and influence . Therefore , Dubai was seen as a potential threat to the security of the United States in the war on terror . With more dirty laundry in line for exposure , Dubai threw in the towel last week and said it would offer the American part of its purchase for sale to a yet-to-be-determined American buyer . <p> Immediately after the debacle , Bush voiced concern about the impact of the rejection on Arab-American relations . The administration marshaled several officials , including Army Gen. John Abizaid , the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East , to lament the blow to the UAE . <p> But remember , the UAE needs the United States , too , especially for military protection against Iran . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emirates were put to rest when the Dubai central government on Saturday said that it values its ties with the United States and will make every effort to reinforce them . <p> A poorly made deal <p> On the whole , the offer was a catastrophe in the making , one that could have been avoided had it been handled with sensitivity , professionalism and far more transparency on both sides  --  Arab and American . <p> On the side of the UAE , whose prime minister , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum , made the bid , the tiny but extraordinarily rich Emirates found itself caught unprepared for the political fallout . <p> Flush with oil money and revenue and accustomed to getting anything it wants without any internal or external objections , the Emirate of Dubai , one of seven making up the UAE federation , was left speechless . <p> The UAE reacted typically as an oligarchy , ordering from the top that much of the news media simply repeat the official belief that it was a done deal . <p> On the American side , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near secrecy and rushed quickly through a dubious vetting process . It all added a sinister overtone , leading many to push the panic button . <p> The lesson here , for those Arabs who hope to continue to spread their humongous oil revenue around the globe in the next few years , is that you can not do business in a global economy under banana republic rules . <p> The USA is not a perfect democracy , but it functions as one often enough with a system of checks and balances that kicks in as it did with DP World . In such circumstances , it is not enough for the top man on either side of a deal to say yes . Many other parties have to say it , too , especially when it involves national security at ports or airports . <p> DP World was formed last September in a merger of Dubai Port Authority and Dubai Port International . After all is said and done , the whole outfit is owned by the prime minister , Maktoum . <p> The man behind the deal <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a smart , ambitious and aggressive acquirer of wealth who is not used to extensive consultations or having his motives questioned by anyone , let alone foreigners . That , put simply , is not good enough when venturing into the rough seas of globalized economics . <p> While Dubai is indeed not in any way a menace to the United States in the war against terror , it comes up too short on minimal requirements of transparency , democracy and freedom . Its commerce , media and government structure make for a welcoming environment for sympathizers of terror activities . This is somewhat balanced by Dubai 's cutting edge of modernity and its extremely liberal environment of social tolerance . About 90% of its population is made up of expatriates existing in a region where Muslim fundamentalism is the rule . <p> All of this should have been anticipated , explained and exposed to several American parties well ahead of the deal 's announcement . Hatching the sale in secrecy was not necessary to protect it . Because the offer made by Dubai was so generous , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offer lagged seriously in public relations . <p> In a typical Arab fashion , Dubai opted instead to hire lobbyists and former U.S. politicians to grease the wheels , including former senator Bob Dole and former secretary of State Madeleine Albright ( Dole 's law and lobbying firm , Alston &; Bird , and The Albright Group , led by Albright , were officially hired by DP World to lobby the deal in Washington ) . Dubai also depended on the good advice of former president Bill Clinton . This often works , but as is the case here , it sometimes backfires . <p> Hypocrisy in the air <p> On the American side , a galling revelation is how Sen. Hillary Clinton , D-N.Y. , jumped to oppose the deal while her spouse , the former president , has collected hefty speaking fees in Dubai and Saudi Arabia over the past four years . It is also , to say the least , ironic to watch Albright  --  who spent the better part of her tenure as secretary of State for President Clinton imposing sanctions on Arab and Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobbying for Arabs and Muslims . Talk about having no sense of shame . <p> Furthermore , this DP World deal should have been filtered through scores of U.S. labor union officials , governors , congressional and senatorial aides and representatives , as well as politicians and intelligence folks . Instead of paying Dole and Albright after the fact , the UAE and Dubai should have invited labor and congressional leaders to visit months ago and see Dubai for themselves . Arab officials could then have explained that far from being a promoter of terror , the Emirates and particularly Dubai make up a modern , highly westernized and openly tolerant group of city states with liberal values . Why not flaunt the virtues of the UAE on a worldwide stage ? <p> When issues of national security are involved , goodwill can not be purchased through dubious emissaries . It must be won . <p> From President Bush 's side , errors were equally glaring , more proof that his administration seriously lacks skills of communications . To pass a $6.8 billion deal such as this with a whiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The bottom line : Making a deal with just Abu Abdullah is simply not enough . <p> Youssef M.
