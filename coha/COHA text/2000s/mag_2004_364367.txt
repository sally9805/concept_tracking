His restaurant , El Bulli , which is located up a winding road near the town of Rosas on Catalonia 's Costa Brava , gets 1 million reservation requests a year , only about 8,000 of which he can honor . Adria puts no truck in old standbys . His constantly shifting degustation menu always aims to trump itself . A meal lasts for hours , alternating between sweet and savory , hot and cold , familiar and otherworldly : fried rabbit ears , for instance , translucently thin and tasting like pork rinds ; spaghetti not topped with Parmesan but fashioned from it ; carrots turned into foam , artichokes into puree , and foie gras into ice cream . For such alchemy , Adria maintains a " laboratory workshop " in nearby Barcelona , where he experiments with everything from centrifuges to cotton-candy machines . Adria sees Spain 's pioneering departure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is objectively true that Spain discovered America and brought about a change in cuisine , " he says .
