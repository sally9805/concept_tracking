Up From the Ashes <p> During the summer of 2000 , a wildfire blazed through 500 hectares of grazingland at the Agricultural Research Service 's U.S. Sheep Experiment Station ( USSES ) near Dubois , Idaho . That fire has sparked new research on the effects that grazing animals have on rangeland biodiversity and its recovery after wildfires . <p> Currently , there is much debate among scientists and others about how grazing affects diversity of plant species growing in grazed areas . Some say grazing is harmful ; others claim it neither helps nor hurts ; and still others insist it can be beneficial if managed correctly . But little data has actually been collected until now . <p> " When the 2000 wildfire burned through the station , it destroyed half of a long-term study , " says Gregory Lewis , USSES ' research leader . For more than 50 years , USSES scientists had been analyzing the effects of grazing at different times of year and the effects these grazing periods had on the plant community . <p> During the long-term study , some pastures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall . The control pastures were n't grazed at all , and after 50 years , they had been taken over by a heavy canopy of sagebrush . The fall-grazed pastures had less sagebrush and more perennial forbs , while the spring-grazed pastures had less forb cover and increased grass and sagebrush . <p> Forbs are broadleaf plants that do n't have woody stems and include perennial plants such as arrowleaf balsamroot and tapertip hawksbeard . <p> Rangeland scientist Steven Seefeldt says that when the 2000 fire roared through , the ungrazed pastures fared the worst . According to Seefeldt , " There was n't a green thing left . The fire took it all to the ground . " <p> The spring-grazed plots fared a little better  --  between 3 and 5 percent of the area was not burned . By far , the fall-grazed pastures fared best , with between 15 and 20 percent of the area remaining unburned . Species : Variety vs . Abundance <p> Since the fire , Seefeldt and USSES technician Scott McCoy have been recording the types of vegetation that are growing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species each pasture supports now is virtually identical , " says Seefeldt . The formerly fall-grazed and ungrazed pastures currently support 70 species each , and the formerly spring-grazed pastures support 69 . <p> The differences become noticeable when the relative abundance of each of the species the pastures support is taken into consideration . Seefeldt and McCoy say that more of the spring-grazed land is now taken up by invasive and annual species . <p> This research will add important information to the debate about the consequences of grazing  --  and its timing  --  on biodiversity . To Graze or Not To Graze ... <p> In a related study , Seefeldt is looking at the effect sheep have on rangeland when they 're allowed to graze relatively soon after a wildfire . <p> Seefeldt explains that in the past decade , hundreds of thousands of hectares of rangeland in the western United States have burned in wildfires . To allow these areas time to recover , land managers usually prohibit livestock from grazing on them for 2 to 3 years . Unfortunately , in many cases , the land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The invasive weeds can crowd out native vegetation , change fire frequency , decrease palatable forage for native animals , and increase soil erosion . <p> The research currently available regarding when to begin grazing again on burned areas does not take into account growth and development of invasive weeds and their effects on native plants . To address this lack of data , Seefeldt has teamed with Karen Launchbaugh , a professor of rangeland ecology at the University of Idaho . Woolly Weed Whackers <p> Sheep are efficient foragers and , unlike cattle , can thrive on a fair number of invasive Weeds , such as leafy spurge and spotted knapweed . After the fire of 2000 , Seefeldt says the experiment station had a great opportunity to determine which plants would take root most quickly after a fire and to find out how grazing animals such as sheep would affect the rangeland 's recovery . <p> He hypothesized that if sheep were allowed to graze relatively soon after a fire , a higher percentage of invasive plants would be eaten , giving native vegetation the time it needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be correct , sheep producers could benefit just as much as native plant species . They could offer their animals ' services as rangeland rehabilitators after a fire . <p> The idea of using sheep as biological control agents for weeds has precedent . In Canada , some producers are paid as much as $5 per sheep per month to have their animals graze on lands that are part of reforestation projects . Both the producers and the land managers benefit in this situation . The sheep get paid to eat , and the land managers spend much less money than they would have on herbicides or mowing . Also , sheep can be herded to where they 're needed most  --  unlike insect biocontrol agents . When the season 's over , their wool , meat , and lanolin can be sold for profit . <p> To test whether sheep will keep invasive plant populations in check on burned rangelands , Seefeldt has fenced off spring-graze , fall-graze , and control  --  or no-graze  --  pastures in the burned area . Because of an atypical weather pattern in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasive downy brome was suppressed on all pastures during the first year of the study . <p> The team has evidence that letting sheep graze on recovering rangeland is not necessarily harmful  --  if the grazing is managed correctly . Seefeldt describes the lack of a fence-line contrast between two pastures in the study . " The pastures looked nearly identical in the summer of 2002 , even though one had been grazed in the fall of 2001 and the other had n't been grazed at all since the fire , " he says . <p> Seefeldt and his collaborators will continue the study for 2 more years . <p> This research is part of Rangeland , Pastures , and Forages , an ARS National Program ( #205 ) described on the World Wide Web at www.nps.ars.usda.gov . <p> Steven S.
