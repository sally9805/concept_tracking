<p> It 's almost fitting that the Band Not Formerly Known as KISS is setting up its stage next to the Looney Tunes store inside AstroWorld . <p> These are guys - some with families - who are on the heels of 30 or older . By day , they have white-collar jobs that require business or business-casual attire . By night , they 're donning makeup , leather collars and boots with serious heels to play out their childhood fantasy : being the rock ' n ' roll band KISS . <p> Definitely not typical adult behavior . <p> This weekday night , roadies are busy constructing the stage , hoisting the band 's banner and scaling the walls like creatures of the night . Fog machines send white smoke billowing into the air . And bass guitar rumbles like an earthquake through the amusement park . <p> Mike Campion , who has his Gene Simmons AXE bass guitar hanging across his body , takes a swig of 190-proof booze made in the backwoods of Kentucky , grabs a lighted torch and - with a cavemanlike stroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the 29-year-old bank vice president extends the torch upward to the rock gods . He stares at the hypnotizing flame - its edges flickering in the breeze . <p> Campion spits - almost in disgust - breathing life to a 10-foot flame that rockets to the heavens . <p> " Oh-h-h-h , yeah ! " other band members and roadies scream . " Did you see that ? " <p> The fiery feat was another dream come true for this KISS tribute band , which is playing Six Flags AstroWorld Fright Fest every weekend this month , as well as in a couple of Houston clubs for Halloween . <p> It 's their homage to a group that has sold millions of records and rocked the 1970s with its hit anthems " Rock and Roll All Nite " and " Shout It Out Loud . " The band was so hot it had its own comic book , board game , dolls , pinball machine and TV movie , " KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park . " <p> Campion says there are about 10 serious KISS tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , Houston boasts the only band with a fifth member - Vinnie Vincent . <p> Rock on . <p> Here 's the band 's lineup : <p> On lead vocals ( Paul Stanley ) is Paul Scott , a restaurant/retail manager ; on the guitar ( Ace Frehley ) , we have Schuyler Smith , a computer tech at Seabrook Systems ; also on the guitar ( Vinnie Vincent , who filled in for Frehley in the early 1980s ) is Chuck McFadden , a satellite dish independent contractor ; on the bass ( Gene Simmons ) is Campion , a vice president at Bank of America ; and on the drums ( Peter Criss ) , we have David DeCasper , a paralegal at J. Steve Brownhill &; Associates . <p> DeCasper says he performs because it 's a complete release from all of life 's craziness . <p> " My job is incredibly high-pressure , " the 34-year-old says . " When the music starts , I can forget about the bills , the clients , the mortgage , the wife . " <p> Mrs. DeCasper , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 30 , this tribute gig allows him to live a lifelong fantasy . <p> " It 's the idea of walking in ( Paul Stanley 's ) boots for one night without actually being him , " he says . " Even bands that are original do covers of their favorite songs . We just happen to do the whole thing . We 're more about celebrating ( KISS 's music ) than imitating . " <p> The tribute band is n't just about five guys celebrating the music of KISS . It 's for the fans , too - all you maniacal , blood-spitting , head-banging followers . <p> " It 's self-gratifying , no doubt , " DeCasper says . " But to watch the fans go nuts is something else . KISS fans are a different breed . " <p> Or species , one could argue . <p> Like all rock ' n ' roll band stories , this one has chapters about a chance meeting between group members , the need for a last-minute bassist replacement and finding the right kind of musical chemistry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank onWestheimer . He was going about his banking duties when he saw Scott in line , wearing a KISS T-shirt . <p> Being a die-hard fan , Campion made his way to the line and introduced himself as a fellow KISS follower and bass player . This was some strange customer service , Scott first thought . <p> " Whenever you see someone with a shirt like his , it 's like seeing an immediate friend , " Campion explains . <p> They became friends - not the best of friends but buds with a similar interest , obsession even . <p> A few weeks later , Scott 's KISS tribute band in the making , which included DeCasper , needed a bass player because their current one backed out . <p> Scott remembered the corporate boy , Campion , and gave him an audition . Campion knew 20 of the 23 songs on the set list . <p> " He came in and just floored us , " Scott recalls . <p> The rest , as they say , is KISS-tory . <p> In the 1980s , all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , hoping to churn out hit after hit and tour the American landscape . <p> Then Seattle-based grunge music hit it big , and the poof in hair bands went flatter than big Texas hair in August humidity . So did their dreams , for the most part . <p> Some got married and had kids , which meant getting 9-to-5 jobs with benefits . But the musical urge never vanished . <p> If they could n't be the next great American rock band , why not pay homage to one ? <p> After adding Campion to the mix , the band added KISS fanatics McFadden , 31 , and Smith , 29 , to replace a member who moved from Houston and one whose heart was n't in it . <p> " It never really clicked until the current five of us , " DeCasper says . <p> The KISS tribute group was finally complete - heart and soul . <p> When the band started in 1997 , it wore regular clothes and no makeup . For Halloween that year , it added the makeup and double-breasted suits like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The crowds went ballistic . <p> " It 's one of those childhood dreams to be in KISS makeup and be believable , " Campion says . " The plan was n't to wear makeup . Then we realized we had the facial features and looked like them with makeup . This is a dream come true . " <p> To complete the KISS look , this year the band added handmade leather costumes , which come from the KISS eras of " Love Gun , " " Creatures of the Night " and " Destroyer . " <p> " One of my fears was that people would see us as a bunch of 30-something , overweight guys , " DeCasper says . " And we took that into account when we made the costumes . " <p> These guys would n't be KISS , at least not early KISS , if they let you see their faces sans makeup . <p> " It adds to the whole KISS mystique , " Scott says . " A lot of people know I 'm into KISS , but not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you some privacy . " <p> Yes , they need it . Sometimes after concerts , groupies try to hang around . Fans want them to sign autographs or chat about KISS till the sun comes up . <p> But it 's a fantasy they would n't give up - at least not any time soon . <p> Remember , these guys were spinning KISS vinyl records , spitting red food coloring and painting their faces in grade school . <p> " Funny , we 're still doing it to this day , " Smith says . <p> " In addition to Fright Fest , the band will also play at Surfside Sally 's on Friday and Oct. 28 for its Halloween party and at Sam 's Boat on Richmond on Oct. 27 .
