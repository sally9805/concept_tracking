Preface // In a small village in northern Italy called Limone sul Garda live people with astonishingly little heart disease . Their bodies produce a protein called ApoA-I Milano . This protein appears to be as close to a miracle substance as has even been found in the century-long history of modern cardiology . ApoA-I Milano strikes at the epicenter of heart disease , the soft fatty core of the blockages found in coronary arteries . ApoA-I Milano rapidly mobilizes cholesterol and transports it away , sharply decreasing the size of the blockage . What truly blows researchers away is how quickly ApoA-I Milano works . // The conventional wisdom is that it takes many years of rigorous dieting , exercise , and medications even to begin to make a dent in lowering cholesterol . Yet ApoA-I works in as little as forty-eight hours ! // This has completely revolutionized the thinking of cardiologists like the Cleveland Clinic 's Dr. Steven Nissen , who now sees coronary artery disease as a tremendously dynamic condition capable of breathtaking changes in very short periods of time . Just five weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , in human beings produced significant regression of coronary artery disease . ApoA-I has been used alone , but already cardiologists are planning to use it with other lifesaving medications such as statins . The future of heart disease therapy may look like that of certain cancers cures  --  a cocktail of drugs , each hitting a different target . The up-and-coming heart disease cocktails will cure the disease , say many of the nation 's top cardiologists , entirely preventing heart attacks and deaths from heart disease in much of the population  --  if begun early enough . // New miracle drugs are even more critical to immediate lifesaving efforts . Doctors used to think of coronary artery disease as discrete blockages in the arteries that could be easily seen on coronary angiograms and treated with surgery or balloon therapy . Now a new research device called intravascular ultrasound paints a much more alarming picture . While a single large blockage may be visible on an angiogram , there may be dozens of submerged plaques that show only as small blockages or do n't show at all . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , it 's like having the street in front of your house lined with dozens of improvised explosive devices , mines and grenades , any one of which could explode at any moment . You may see one at the end of your driveway , but all the rest are buried . // The smartest strategy is to defuse these explosive devices . Diffusing an entire artery can be done only with medication or by completely bypassing it . Fortunately , as you 'll read in the chapter on medications , this can be done quickly and effectively . // The most stunning development in the long history of cardiology may be the breathtaking new miracle drugs that can save your life in weeks . That 's the good news . The bad news is that the vast majority of Americans with heart disease are not following even the most basic course of action  --  with tragic results . Many of us need a highly customized treatment program , but few receive it . It 's a lesson I learned the hard way , in the case of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I researched and wrote this book . // This book will help you become a smart consumer , able to navigate the treacherous shoals of modern cardiology , whether you are at low , moderate , or high risk . // It works . Using the exact steps in this book , my mother 's life was miraculously saved when heart disease came within minutes of killing her . //
