<p> WASHINGTON  --  For President Bush , 2005 was a year of growing public impatience with the Iraq war , angst over record gas prices , devastation from Hurricane Katrina , the collapse of his Social Security plan and , finally , a firestorm over his decision to authorize targeted domestic spying without court warrants . <p> Now he faces a challenge that has upended the best-laid plans of his predecessors : his sixth year in office . <p> It was in the sixth year of their presidencies that Bill Clinton was impeached and Richard Nixon was forced to resign , that Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower faced the worst scandals of their tenures and that Franklin Roosevelt encountered increased resistance to New Deal legislation . <p> The White House and its allies see opportunities , though , sixth year or not . " This president has a real pattern of defying conventional wisdom , " says Mark McKinnon , media adviser for Bush 's presidential campaigns . <p> Top aides say Bush aims to travel more often and speak out more forcefully , touting the economy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployment to Iraq of two brigades , or about 7,000 soldiers , the first small step in a hoped-for drawdown of U.S. troops there . To avoid the sort of stalemate that undermined his Social Security proposal , Bush will downsize his domestic agenda , proposing changes in immigration law but shelving , at least for now , plans for a tax overhaul . <p> " I 've been thinking long and hard about 2006 , " Bush told reporters Sunday . White House spokesman Scott McClellan says the basic game plan is simple : " The economy and progress in Iraq . " <p> The president 's most powerful aide , Karl Rove , has invited think-tank analysts , authors and others to the White House for ideas to help reinvigorate the president 's domestic agenda . Bush launched a more aggressive communications campaign last month , defending the war in Iraq and his policies on terrorism in speeches and at a year-end news conference . <p> But there is trouble on the horizon , too , and events that are outside White House control . <p> In Iraq , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after December 's elections . At home , the trial of Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff in the CIA leak case could bring damaging disclosures , and Rove remains in jeopardy in the inquiry . The Justice Department ethics investigation of lobbyist Jack Abramoff threatens to ensnare more officeholders , most of them Republicans . <p> After five years of extraordinary party discipline , Republican members of Congress have begun defying the administration more often . On spending and taxes , deficit hawks are increasingly vocal . And Bush 's job-approval rating was an anemic 41% in the USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken Dec. 16-18 . <p> Thomas Mann , a political scientist at the Brookings Institution in Washington , warns that Bush lacks " a compelling agenda for the year that might switch the focus " from bad news . His choice of immigration as a centerpiece " is filled with the potential for division within his own party . " <p> All in all , Mann says , " I think the year is filled with peril for him . " <p> The comeback strategy <p> White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the year . Steps on the road back that they 've mapped : <p> *Start fast . Bush wants to start the year by scoring a quick victory with Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito . Judiciary Committee hearings begin on Monday . Barring new disclosures , Democrats now seem unlikely to filibuster , the procedural maneuver that could block a vote . <p> Then , at the end of the month , Bush gets an hour of prime time to deliver his State of the Union address before Congress . <p> Congressional Democrats wo n't be idle , though . They are pushing for hearings this month on the president 's decision to authorize domestic electronic surveillance of people suspected of links to terrorism without the court warrants normally required by federal law and the Constitution . <p> *Stay aggressive . Allies say the administration was slow last year to respond to attacks on Iraq , including allegations officials manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion . <p> When attacked in 2006 , " we 'll aggressively set the record straight , " says White House counselor Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learned anything this year , it 's ' hit back , hit back hard and fast . ' " <p> Case in point : When The New York Times broke the story on domestic surveillance last month , Bush immediately defended it as essential for national security . The next day , he devoted his Saturday radio address to the subject , and he later called disclosure of the program " a shameful act . " <p> Bush also has been more pointed toward Democrats . When Senate Democrats joined with four Republicans to block reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act in December , he said their action would " endanger America . " <p> Nonetheless , after a last-minute scramble , the House and Senate agreed only to a five-week extension of the law . The debate will resurface before the measure lapses again on Feb. 3 . <p> *Bring some troops home  --  or at least keep them safer . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld announced during a surprise pre-Christmas visit to Fallujah , Iraq , that the administration would begin withdrawing troops from Iraq this year . Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how well Iraqi security forces progress . " The conditions on the ground will dictate our force level , " he said Sunday after visiting injured veterans at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio . <p> Even so , Bush has noted that U.S. forces gradually are turning over military bases to Iraqis , putting them in the forefront and providing some insulation for American troops . " You 're beginning to see our troops step back from the fight , " he said last month . <p> That presumably would reduce U.S. casualties , which remained steady last year . In 2005 , the number of U.S. troops who died in Iraq was 841 , four fewer than in 2004 . <p> Reducing the U.S. presence could be difficult , however , if Iraqis ca n't form a new government or if the country spirals into civil war . Bush said a precipitous withdrawal " would hand Iraq over to enemies who have pledged to attack us . " <p> *Talk up the economy . In Chicago on Friday , Bush is slated to deliver the first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax cuts passed in his first term for strong economic growth and job creation last year  --  " the envy of the world , " he said in his radio address on Saturday . Some of those cuts are due to expire soon , and he pledges to make them permanent . <p> The White House also plans to put forward programs designed to bolster what it calls economic security : tax-free health savings accounts , pension changes and help for the Katrina-ravaged Gulf Coast . Bush will spotlight the start of the prescription-drug program for Medicare recipients , though the sign-up period got off to a rocky start amid complaints of confusion from some seniors . <p> Potential problem : The expensive drug program and hurricane relief will add to the federal budget deficit , already a source of concern . <p> *Scale back big promises . Bush 's top domestic agenda item in 2005 was an ambitious plan to " transform " Social Security by adding individual investment accounts to the nation 's retirement system . The plan drew powerful opposition from the AARP  --  the behemoth seniors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional Republicans shied from embracing it . <p> A commission Bush named to study the tax system submitted a 272-page report in November , proposing a simplification scheme that included scaling back popular deductions for home mortgage interest and state and local taxes . Treasury Secretary John Snow says the report is still under study . Republicans who work with the administration say the White House is likely to push limited changes this year , not a controversial revamp . <p> " A lot of the goals are going to relate to spending , as opposed to going after a radical tax-reform package , " says Charlie Black , a Republican strategist with ties to the White House . One reason for caution : Every tax break has protectors in Congress . <p> *Keep the Republican family together . Republicans generally stuck with Bush in 2005 , despite some erosion among voters in the aftermath of Katrina and protests from conservative activists after the nomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court . Bush withdrew Miers ' name before the Judiciary Committee began hearings . <p> Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a solid 86% of Republicans  --  critical since only 31% of independents and 10% of Democrats approve of the job he 's doing . Republicans need to hold the base together to retain control of the House and Senate in the 2006 elections . <p> That cohesion could be imperiled by Bush 's plan to focus on immigration , an issue that divides major factions in the GOP coalition . A business-oriented coalition led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports provisions to permit immigrant " guest workers , " while many conservatives , including outspoken Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo , demand tighter borders . <p> Former Republican national chairman Ed Gillespie is trying to bridge those differences through an advocacy group called Americans for Border and Economic Security , formed at the impetus of the White House . " It 's important for us as a party that we handle the issue right , " Gillespie says . <p> Back on the stump <p> Bush plans to campaign as extensively for Republican candidates in 2006 as he did in 2002 . He remains the party 's most effective fundraiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his standing with swing voters has weakened . <p> History is n't on his side . In modern times , the president 's party usually suffers significant losses in the congressional elections held in his sixth year in office . Democrats lost a stunning 71 House seats during FDR 's sixth year ; Republicans lost eight seats and control of the Senate in Reagan 's sixth year . <p> The exception was in 1998 , when Democrats gained four House seats during Clinton 's sixth year . But during the midterm elections in his first term , in 1994 , Democratic losses were so severe that the party lost control of both houses of Congress . <p> The challenge for the GOP in 2006 is that " voters want change , " Republican National Chairman Ken Mehlman says . " They not only want the changes we 're offering , they want more change , and we have to continue to be the party of change . " <p> Allies predict Bush 's sixth year will be better than his fifth , though that 's not a high bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second term of any except Nixon , caught in the Watergate scandal . <p> " A perfect storm of problems " for Bush , says Grover Norquist , president of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform and an activist close to Rove . " No one or two of them were fatal , but seven of them ? They made life rough . " <p> The good news , he says , is that many of those troubles have reversed : Gas prices have declined . Memories of Katrina are fading with time . While violence continues in Iraq , a constitution has been ratified and elections held . <p> " We do n't have to be out of Iraq by September " to boost Americans ' views of the war and help Republicans fare well in November 's elections , Norquist says . " What we have to do is : Iraq with an elected leadership . Iraq every two months with some announcement that more U.S. troops are coming back  --  a steady sense of that . " <p> It is the war that carries the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If somehow he got off the track of Iraq being solved , that would be problematic . " <p> Bartlett agrees : " The public wants to see tangible progress . " <p> Why is the sixth year of a presidency typically so troubled ? <p> " Presidents by six years have been there long enough for the media and the country to see their flaws , " says presidential historian Robert Dallek , author of books about FDR , Nixon and Reagan , among others . The initiatives launched with such promise when they first took office have had time to succeed or fail . The advisers who helped them win the White House are often exhausted or have moved on . Years in power sometimes breed arrogance or isolation . <p> No modern two-term president has escaped the six-year itch , but some have recovered more successfully than others . <p> Roosevelt dealt with the approach of World War II and won third and fourth terms . Reagan replaced the top aides implicated in the Iran-contra scandal and negotiated arms control with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If circumstances favor you and you 're pragmatic enough to respond to those circumstances , it 's not impossible " to recover , Dallek says . " But it 's hard . " <p> And time is short . <p> By November of a president 's sixth year , voters usually seem eager for new faces and policies ; that 's why the party that has held the White House typically suffers big losses in the midterm elections . Many members of Congress , even friendly ones , begin worrying more about their own re-election and less about loyalty to the president . <p> And the seventh year ? By then , the focus begins to turn to who will be the next president .
