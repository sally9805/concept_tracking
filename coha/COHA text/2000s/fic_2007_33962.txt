Chapter One There are two things I will always remember about summers in St. Louis . One is walking barefoot on pavement so hot that I could pop the tar bubbles with my toes . Pavement so hot that , by the end of July , the hide on the soles of my feet was as thick as my tanned-leather coin purse from Woolworth 's and I could cross Arsenal Street without having to run . Every year , some photographer from the Post-Dispatch would take a shot of an egg frying sunny-side-up on the sidewalk and the paper would run it on the front page . HOT ENOUGH TO FRY AN EGG ON THE SIDEWALK ! the headline would bellow . As if they were telling us something we did n't already know . The other thing I 'll always remember is the summer of the penny . At this point in my life , I 'm picking up pennies all the time . But that was n't the case back then . Not before the penny , the important penny , the one that led me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that first special penny how important the little things in life can be . Because the penny led me to knowing Miss Shaw , and knowing Miss Shaw was what started things changing between Daddy and Jean and Mama and me . Before the penny , if you 'd have asked what I knew about Miss Shaw , I 'd haveshrugged and acted like you were loony . " I do n't know anything about her , " I would 've told you , because girls like me had no reason to speak with ladies like Miss Shaw . No one in the neighborhood knew much about Miss Shaw . For although my one friend , Marianne Thompson , and I had seen her greet her customers with a warm smile like she could tell something special about them , people like us never had any reason to set foot inside a jewelry store . So Marianne and I just wondered between ourselves : did she come from money or did she earn it ? Did she grow up around here ? How old was she ? How did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an umbrella ? And because of that , because no one knew where she 'd come from or who her parents were or how she 'd come to have her own jewelry store , she was the most profound mystery along Grand Avenue . And you know how everybody likes to talk about a mystery . " Now there 's a woman up to no good , " Daddy would comment whenever he happened to see Miss Shaw promenading along the sidewalk downtown with her pocketbook tucked beneath her arm . Daddy had a general distrust for all things to do with women bettering themselves . And he had a healthy contempt for Miss Shaw in particular . " That woman causes all the talk , anyway . She thrives on being talked about , or else she would n't stay tight-mouthed the way she does . Let me tell you , there 's a woman who rides a high horse . Acting like the rest of us are n't good enough to know her . " Only one part of the neighborhood hearsay going around about Miss Shaw did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , beauty and superiority . Marianne Thompson made a vow to me once that she 'd seen Miss Shaw sneaking around in the shadows of the town cemetery . She 'd been hiding behind trees , Marianne insisted , and taking careful steps through the fallen leaves so as not to make any sound with her high-heeled shoes , and glancing around stealthily to make certain nobody saw her . She 'd been looking around for a grave , Marianne said , and when she found the one she was looking for , it did n't have a stone . Marianne had seen Miss Shaw stoop to the ground and wipe the dead leaves from a smooth patch of dirt and place her gloved hand atop the dry mound . She held her hand to the ground for the longest time , Marianne declared , like she expected to feel a heartbeat . These are the things I knew for sure about Miss Shaw from my own observance . She arrived at Shaw Jewelers before nine every morning , leaving plenty of time to polish the counters and arrange the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store opened . She wore pumps that reminded me of the ones I 'd seen once when Mama took me to the A &P; Supermarket , the pretend princess shoes you could buy on the toy aisle , with plastic jewels across the toes and soles so stiff and curved that they arched your feet like a ballerina . Every time I saw her , I wanted to stare , seeing how she held herself . To this day , I 'll bet Miss Shaw practiced balancing books on her head while she walked around her house in those beautiful shoes . And this one last important thing I knew about her . No one ever saw Miss Opal Shaw without her white Sunday gloves on , tiny buttons fastened against the soft underside of her wrists . She wore her gloves no matter if she was counting inky receipts or down-shifting her Cadillac convertible or presenting diamonds to a customer . What you have to know is this : South St. Louis is not a place you 'd want to wear white Sunday gloves on any other day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny . I discovered Grace Kelly movies that summer , mostly because the Fox Theater had refrigerated air . The sign proclaimed in frozen-painted letters , AIR COOLED , with white x 's to look like sparkles and icicles hanging from the A and the C. The Fox was so fancy that , after you paid at the box office , you got to pick any one of a dozen gleaming doors to walk through . We lived upstairs in a two-story flat on Wyoming Street , in a neighborhood where the buildings had been wedged much too close together . What had started as red brick , weathered and coated with coal soot , was now the color of brown rust . When the hot air rose , our rooms soaked up heat like an oven . The flat belonged to Daddy and we could have lived downstairs if he 'd wanted , but he reminded Mama every time she asked that he could get higher rent by keeping the paying tenants in the cooler rooms downstairs . My big sister 's temper matched the heat that July . Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowled its cage at the zoo , and about as moody , too . You could almost see the room get darker when she entered the door . Jean , almost four years my senior , had graduated early . There was n't a fourth grade one year , so the school board made it up by dividing the smart third graders from the ones who were n't so well off in that department . Jean acted like she 'd won a Nobel Prize or something , when all she 'd done was show up and go where they told her . Still , if I 'd been in that class , they would have left me in the third grade , and Jean knew it . She bragged about moving up all the time . I guess I understood why . Sometimes , to survive Daddy 's meanness , we got along best by acting too big for our britches . Jean 's secretarial school would start in two months . Lately Mama had begun making off-handed suggestions about Jean taking me for an outing . " You go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have time left to pal around with your sister , " Mama would say as carefully as if she were tiptoeing on shattered glass . Even with that , Jean ignored me . She would slouch in the chair by the window and stare out with her arms crossed . I guess my sister and I got along the way most sisters do . I always felt like I was living in her shadow . She told me later how it bothered her that I was always nipping at her heels . I told her she was wrong-I was just always trying to catch up with her . On the day of the penny , Jean had gone into another brood because Adele Middleton had invited her to spend the night with her family in an air-cooled room at the Ambassador Hotel but , as usual , Daddy had told her no . Daddy always said no to everything . Just because he was miserable , I do n't know why he thought he had to spread that around to the rest of us , too . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't : tall and willowy , with light brown hair and hazel eyes that flashed a hint of green . My hair looked like a fistful of cork grass when I wrestled it into a ponytail . Jean 's hung straight down her back , as smooth as ribbon . When she asked , " Why ca n't I go ? " fear twisted in my throat the same way it did whenever Jean pushed it with Daddy . He would never change . And my sister seemed destined to be the one most willing to provoke his anger . I wanted to grab her and make her be quiet . But before I could , she blurted out , " Why not ? " My sister and I were many things to each other : sidekicks , rivals , accomplices , enemies . Some days we became an indecipherable muddle of all four . As I watched Jean stand up to Daddy , her bravery left me both aching with dread and reeling with love . I wanted to murder her for being so dim . As Daddy ambled across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising agility . The anger in his pale green eyes looked like it could bore holes through my sister . A hank of his sparse brown hair , which he tried to keep combed across his balding scalp , fell forward onto his forehead . His thin , unpleasant lips curled . " You talk back to me , girl , I 'll knock you across the room . " " Jean . " I picked up the goldfish bowl from the coffee table as he advanced on her . " Do n't . " I already knew it would n't help at all to go find Mama . But Jean was too fiery for her own good . " You never let us do anything . " And just like that , Daddy grabbed her by the hair with a hand as broad as a fence board and landed a stinging smack across her face . She staggered over the coffee table , trying to shield herself with her left arm , but Daddy 's punch to the stomach sent her sprawling to the floor . She landed hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " We do n't got money for places like the Ambassador Hotel and you know it . You stop wanting what you ca n't pay for . " Jean stared up at Daddy in hatred . I knew what she must be thinking by the flash in her eyes . Well , of course we 've got money . You spend money all the time . It was an invitation , I wanted to cry to him , but I did n't dare . When people invite you to do something , they do n't intend for you to pay . The window fan did nothing but move the stifling air from one spot to another . Since the heat began , hardly any cars or people had been in sight , not even in Tower Grove Park . Sirens wailed out in the street . And Daddy kept right on going . " I 'll knock you down every time you glare at me like that . You hear me ? " It might have been the wrong thing to think , but I kept wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on . " Jean clutched my hand so tight that the knobs of my knuckles crunched against each other . " Might not have enough for the Ambassador , but we do have enough for a picture show , Jenny . " I knew she was using me to shield herself against Daddy , which made me feel a little important and terrified me all at the same time . I felt important because I was helping Jean . I was frightened because Daddy could just as well beat me up next . " Rear Window is playing . " I tugged on Jean 's arm and tried to make her look at me , but she would n't . If she met my eyes , one of us might have to admit that Daddy scared us . Nobody wanted to do that . It was safer to keep our minds filled with notions of Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart ; we 'd seen Rear Window twice already . " And you wo n't be able to take your eyes off her glowing beauty , " the voiceover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it so many times , I had the words memorized . " She shares the heart and curiosity of James Stewart in this story of romance shadowed by the terror of a horrifying secret . " The delicate , sophisticated actress on safari with Clark Gable , the pioneer bride who protected Gary Cooper in a shoot-out , did n't seem all that remarkable to me . But the movies she played in about girls-winning-out pulled at my insides like the moon tugs at the Mississippi . It was Jean who copied everything about Grace Kelly , from the hair she pulled into the shape of a dinner roll at the nape of her neck , to the dark glasses that made her look glamorous and mysterious at the same time , to the scarf she wore , as billowy as a spring cloud , knotted beneath her chin . Jean drove me crazy , the way she let thoughts of Grace Kelly dominate her life . Sometimes I thought I 'd go nuts if she did n't stop talking about how Mr. Kelly 's nickname for his daughter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of insecticide around the room , or how , at the beginning , most directors she auditioned for found her too tall . I was sick to death of hearing the story of how , when Grace was a teenager , she stood on the front seat in a convertible and steered the car with her feet . I was scrounging through my pocketbook , looking for my coin purse , thinking how my sister drove me out of my wits because she could n't talk about anything besides Grace Kelly , when Jean came and dragged me down the narrow staircase . " Streetcar 's coming , " she said as I squinted against aching splinters of light . But she need n't have told me . The warning bell clanged as the door accordioned open and Jean shoved me up the steps . We lurched to the rear to buy tickets and fell into warm , hard seats . My sister crossed her legs at the knees , shoved her sunglasses up over her forehead and drew out a tube of Pond 's Ever-So-Red lipstick . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she snapped open her purse to return the lipstick , I caught the beginning of what Jean 's grown-up smell would be : a mixture of powder and faint-scented tissue and Emeraude cologne . The sweetness left my head aching and my stomach woozy . When the trolley stopped in front of Woolworth 's and we got off , Jean hurried across the street ahead of me to join the ticket line . Even from this distance , I could see the angry red handprint Daddy left on her cheek . She would be getting away from us soon . I could n't breathe when I thought about Jean getting out of the house , going on to secretarial school . " What are you staring at ? " She plopped her hands on her hips . " Come on . " Often when we were by ourselves at home , when Daddy was gone , when Mama was outside and I was aching to share confidences with my sister , I 'd catch Jean staring at me like she regretted knowing me . Maybe she did n't much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my birth , she was tied to me for life . At times she almost seemed okay with having a sister . At other times , she made it plain she did n't like who her sister was . I could n't do much to make it change , other than wish she 'd try to see me differently . Jean 's moods may have been a bother , I thought as we stood in the street outside the Fox Theater , but I wanted to stay on her good side . She was all I had . That 's when the streetcar clanged its bell and pulled away behind us . That 's the very moment I first saw the penny . And that 's the moment where this story really begins . The penny lay wheat-side-up on the ground , so dirty as to almost be invisible . Like I said , I was n't accustomed to picking up pennies at that point . A penny is such a little thing-it 's never been worth much . I stared at it , stepped over it , and headed toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grand Avenue went silent . Go back , something inside me insisted . Do n't miss this chance . To this day I have to wonder : What if I 'd stepped over that penny and left it where it was ? Or what if I 'd knelt to the ground and grabbed the penny the first time around without stopping to think , if Jean had n't turned toward me from the box office to holler , if she had n't bossed me ( " Okay , Jenny . Jenny , come on-do n't . That 's disgusting , picking things up in the street . You 're washing your hands before you 're getting anything from the snack bar ! " ) , would everything have happened the same ? But I did walk past the penny at first . When something whispered , Pick it up , Jenny-little things make a big difference , my heart almost paused in my chest . And I knew it without a doubt . As surely as if someone well trusted had whispered it in my ear . This moment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of seconds before I went back . Seconds , I found out later , that would change everything . The copper had melted its way clear into the asphalt . I bent over-I still see it in my mind 's eye-and used my fingernails to pry the hot coin out of the roadbed . I remember straightening up , the penny branding my palm right there in the middle of Grand Avenue . And that 's when the mystifying chain of events began . (
