PROLOGUE <br> The Devil 's Light <p> In a West African village , Marissa Brand Okari watched her husband prepare to risk his life for the act of speaking out . <p> It was night . Hundreds of villagers , old and young , gathered in the center of town , their faces illuminated less by moonlight than by the huge orange flame that spewed out of the vertical stem thrusting from an oil pipeline . Torchlike , the stem backlit the line of palms behind the village , its thick residue of smoke blackening the air , its roar a constant ominous presence . Every day in the life of any villager under thirty , this terrible eruption  --  the flaring of gas from the oil extracted by PetroGlobal Luandia from beneath the deep- red clay  --  had never ceased , its searing , poisonous heat denuding trees , killing birds and animals , and turning the rainfall to acid , which corroded the roofs that sheltered the people 's thatched homes . <p> The " devil 's light , " Bobby Okari called it . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders to a rough- hewn platform at the center of the village , past the open- air school , its four poles holding up a canopy of wood and palm leaves ; the white wooden Pentecostal church , where boisterous celebrants sang and prayed each Sunday morning ; the marketplace , now dark for the night , where women peddled an ever- dwindling harvest of fish and fruit , the legacy of oil spills that fouled the oceans , creeks , and farmland . <p> To Marissa 's anxious eyes , her husband looked elated , as though the festive scene that typified Asari Day , the annual expression of Asari heritage and harmony , carried no undercurrent of fear . The young men around him , Bobby 's core cadre of followers , held him higher , his burgundy African shirt resplendent , his reading glasses hanging from a gold chain around his neck . On this Asari Day , as ever , the villagers had gathered here at dawn for the singing , drumming , and dancing by groups of girls and women in bright dresses , their celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was different : at Bobby Okari 's urging , in every village in Asariland , people had come together  --  three hundred thousand Asari in all  --  to protest the devastation caused by the partnership between PetroGlobal Luandia and the regime of General Savior Karama , which , in Bobby 's pungent phrase , " drills and kills without remorse . " <p> This village , Goro , was Bobby 's ancestral home . His father , Femi Okari , was its chief ; though Bobby 's fame as a novelist , and then as a spokesman for his people , had taken him to many lands , he still kept a home here to maintain his tribal roots . On this day , Bobby and Marissa had driven here from their compound in Port George , and his followers sang or chanted or beat their sheepskin drums to announce his advent . Now , as the young men thrust him atop the platform , the throng pressed forward to hear him  --  some men in shirts and pants , others , mostly elders , in the traditional round cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings , and beads set off against bright blouses , the young women 's dresses single- wrapped in contrast to the double wrapping of the matrons . As suitable for a married woman , Marissa , a matron at thirty- six despite her slim body and lineless skin , wore a double wrapping , in contrast to Omo , the fifteen- year- old girl whose hand she held and whose beautiful eyes shone with adoration for Bobby Okari . <p> " Ma'am , " Omo said simply , " your husband is a great man . " <p> Looking into the girl 's face , still so innocent , Marissa tried to quell the sense of danger she had felt ever since Bobby had conceived this , the first mass protest in the history of Asariland . In its place came a fleeting amazement at the choices that had brought her , an American of mixed race , to this life and this man ; to this astonishing and deeply accursed country ; and to the Asari , a mere half million people among Luandia 's two hundred and fifty ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse blessing was that beneath their land lay the richest oil reserves in one of the world 's most oil- rich regions , the Luandian Delta . Until Bobby Okari , the Asari had endured the consequences in silence , robbed of heart and hope . But now Bobby , through his eloquence and relentless work , had summoned a grassroots movement , offering the restless young a vision beyond that of the armed militia groups that hid in the swamps and creeks that made the delta a trackless maze . It was Bobby 's strength  --  or blindness  --  that his belief in the movement he had summoned from nothing overcame his fear of an autocracy whose leader , General Karama , caused those who displeased him to die or disappear . <p> " The Asari , " Marissa answered Omo softly , " are a brave people . " <p> Bobby held up a hand for silence . As Marissa scanned the crowd , she spotted Bobby 's father , Chief Femi Okari , his face grim beneath his broad fedora , his eyes slits of disapproval and resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the collective admiration of his son , the pride of the Asari . As the cries for Bobby receded into a deep silence , her husband stood taller , his slight form radiating an energy that suffused his proud bearing and made him seem larger than he was , less vulnerable than the flawed and troubled man Marissa knew him to be . As he began speaking , even his voice  --  deep yet lilting  --  belied any hint of frailty . <p> <p> " Haah Ama , " he began in Asari , then translated the phrase into English , Luandia 's colonial tongue : " Community , I greet you . " <p> Men 's and women 's voices answered with cries of varied timbres . Then Bobby turned , pointing to the giant flame that lit the dark behind him . " This , " he called out , " is the bastard child of a rapacious oil company and a corrupt and brutal autocracy . Together , PetroGlobal Luandia and the Karama regime have polluted our streams , killed our fish , denuded our land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil beneath our feet . " <p> <p> " Yes , " a chorus of voices called out . <p> Bobby 's voice rose above the din . " For years we have suffered . But now , at last , we demand an end to their tyranny . We insist on our rightful share of oil monies for schools , roads , clinics , clean water to drink . The United Nations itself has recognized our oppression . And yet the government and PGL pretend to be deaf and dumb . <p> " When I sent them the Asari Manifesto five months ago , demanding our rights , they did not answer . " Bobby 's deep voice became slow and somber . " And six weeks ago , when the people of Lana gathered to protest an oil spill , our government sent Col onel Okimbo and his soldiers to kill eighty- two Asari of both sexes and all ages ; rape women and girls ; amputate the limbs of men and boys ; and burn their village to the ground . " <p> Marissa knew the stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered voices receded into silence , the only sound the deep roar of flaring oil . In the light from the giant orange flame , a shadow crossed Omo 's face , and she gripped Marissa 's hand more tightly . " Tonight , " Bobby said in the same low voice , " we are out in force , three hundred thousand strong , calling for an end to this exploitation in every village in Asariland . Even for General Karama , that is too many villages to raze , too many people to kill . " <p> Calls of approval rose from the Asari . But Marissa 's voice caught in her throat : in Luandia her husband 's words were sedition , and surely somewhere among his listeners was an agent of the state security services , armed with a tape recorder . <p> Bobby 's face glistened with sweat . " And yet the government and PGL are already committing genocide against the Asari people . When we can not farm or fish or drink our water  --  that is genocide . When more Asari are dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find no work  --  that is genocide . When we are riddled with diseases but have no electricity for hospitals  --  that is genocide . <p> " That is what oil has done to the Asari  --  the same oil that runs the factories , heats the homes , and fills the gas tanks of the Americans , the Europe ans , and our new exploiters , the Chinese . " Bobby stared out at the crowd , moving his gaze from side to side , as though to seal their bond . " In Luandia , oil blackens everything it touches . It fouls the hands of the ruling class that misappropriates its profits . It stains the ambitions of the young , who in their desperation will pick up a gun , sabotage a pipeline , kidnap a foreigner to grab their pitiful share of the riches . It elevates the powerful , and drowns the weak . And it degrades the character of our people , unleashing greed , envy , dishonesty , and corruption . Oil is dirty  --  as dirty as the slave trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Shame , " a man called out . <p> " Yes , " Bobby answered . " But now it is not some colonial governor who rules us . It is a Luandian who has suspended our constitution , banned our political parties , jailed our leaders , and shut down our newspapers . Karama 's police extort money from the innocent ; his prisoners rot for years without a trial ; his judges take bribes before pronouncing sentence . And he uses ill- gotten petrodollars to pay off the generals , bureaucrats , governors , and chiefs who help maintain his power , the better to siphon the billions he steals from us into American jets , Italian sports cars , and bank accounts in Switzerland . " <p> <p> No , Marissa thought  --  not at the sound of truth , but from fear of its consequences . For a moment , she shut her eyes , instinctively listening for alien sounds , perhaps a powerboat landing on the beach nearby , the first warning of an invader . Through the roar of flaring she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be , " Bobby was saying . " People are not made for states  --  states are made for people . " <p> Marissa opened her eyes . From the sky behind her husband came a streak of light , blurred by the orange glow of the flare . Then the sound she heard merged with the silhouette of a heli copter , hovering above the palm trees with an arrhythmic thud , its beam aimed at the villagers , whose heads turned from Bobby to stare upward at the dark metallic bird . Marissa glimpsed a white circle painted on its side , framing the large black letters PGL . <p> On the platform , Bobby looked from the helicopter to his people , their connection to him severed by the fear stamped on their faces . Part of Marissa wished for Bobby to send them home . <p> Instead , his voice carried above the sounds of blades chopping air . He pointed to the intruder . " PGL , too , " he cried out , " is our oppressor . It banished peace from our land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing stand in its way  --  not trees or farms or rivers , nor even beast or man . " <p> As did the others , Marissa saw , Femi Okari looked from the helicopter to Bobby . " Why ? " Bobby shouted . " Because we are Africans . Petro Global does not rape the land in the United States or Europe  --  only in Luandia . And now we 've become its pawns in a ruthless competition among superpowers frightened that terrorists will cut off the flow of the oil from the Middle East , their lifeblood . . . " <p> As though in answer , the helicopter swooped down over the platform , the swirling blades drowning out Bobby 's voice , its shaft of light impaling him like a lone figure in a passion play . Following the beam upward , Marissa could make out the fleshy face of a blond man gazing down from the chopper at Bobby Okari . And then , with a leisure that made its departure as ominous as its presence , the helicopter floated away until at last it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illuminated sky . <p> Only then did Bobby speak again , his voice softer but still resonant . <p> " Tonight , we demand that those whose lives depend on oil respect our lives and our lands . That the United States , PetroGlobal Oil 's home , require its subsidiary PGL to follow the high standard of human rights it professes to value and open its courts to our claims against it . That PGL renounce its pact with General Karama and his machinery of death and open its books so that we can see how much our government has stolen from us . That the Karama regime grant us the right to run our own affairs , and free elections where our ballots are counted , not burned . " <p> With each demand , the crowd seemed more inspired , its outcry louder and more sustained . " The people of Lana , " Bobby continued , " asked these things and were slaughtered for it . So now I tell Karama this . <p> " Tonight , throughout Asariland , Asari women are blocking the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments ago , Asari men in boats seized the offshore oil platform that mars the serenity of our fishing waters . " With the voice and manner of a prophet , Bobby pointed over the heads of his listeners . " Look , and you will see . " <p> Turning with the others , Marissa looked toward the mouth of the creek that ran beside the village to the ocean and saw the flicker of torchlights from the oil platform , as though suspended above the dark waters . Only then did she fully comprehend how much her husband had dared ; when Bobby spoke again , the Asari turned to him in wonder . " The time has come , " he told them , " for General Karama to help us build the Asariland of our hopes . <p> " We know that he can do this . In four years he raised a new capital city from nothing , then named this glistening creation after himself . " Bobby 's lips formed a broad but ironic smile . " So we will promise him that every road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . We will do this for him , yes ? " <p> Amid the cheers and laughter someone called out , " Yes . " <p> " It must be so , " Bobby answered , his voice strong again . " For this has become a dangerous country . Too many of our young men , deprived of any future , drink gin and smoke weed from morning to night . Too many others have taken up arms and vanished to hideouts in the creeks , killing one another for the right to live as criminals . If Karama does not yield , we will descend into an unending darkness of corruption , criminality , murder , and reprisal , condemning those who survive to a permanent hell . And among the things that will not survive is PGL  --  " <p> " Kill them all , " a young man called out . <p> Glancing through the crowd , Marissa spotted him , a youth taller than most others  --  restrained from joining the militia , rumor had it , only by his attraction to Omo . Glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with doubt and worry . " No , " Bobby answered . " To act with violence will only bring to our door reprisals far more terrible than what we saw in Lana . I want no more blood spilled in Asariland . " <p> Uncertainty filled the young man 's face ; though some around him nodded their approval , others wore expressions grimmer and more opaque . As though to reassure them , Bobby continued : " But the government 's time is short . Every day our patience frays , and our youth slip beyond our power to restrain them . Karama and PGL must give us justice now , or there will be no peace for the powerful and PGL will be driven from Asariland . " <p> " Fuck PGL , " a voice called , and then a ragged chant came from a cluster of young men near Marissa . " PGL , go to hell . PGL , go to hell . . . " <p> Bobby held up a hand , his face impassive until , at last , there was silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told them , " and pray for the souls of our dead . " <p> As conceived by Bobby , the climactic event would be a meeting with demonstrators from a neighboring village at the site of a recent oil spill , which , bursting into flames , had incinerated men and women from both villages who had come to scavenge for oil . Tonight those assembled would gather in memorial . But at least one of the villagers would be missing : Chief Femi Okari , Marissa noted , had gazed across the water at the torches flickering on the oil platform and then , shaking his head , turned away to walk home . <p> With Bobby and Marissa at their head , the people of Goro gathered where the road began , many with cigarette lighters held aloft . As the march commenced , the villagers began singing their anthem : " Be proud , Asari people , be proud . " <p> A few feet ahead , Marissa spoke to Bobby beneath the chorus . " Women blocking roads , men seizing the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dangerous , you mean ? " <p> His voice held a hint of challenge . " I already know that , " Marissa answered calmly . " So do the others . " <p> " Do you doubt me ? " <p> " Only when I should . What did Atiku say ? " <p> Bobby did not look at her . " Atiku is rallying support in England , " he answered in a weary voice . " Our young need more than words from us , or more will drift away . " <p> Through her misgivings , Marissa sensed that he had made this decision in the face of resis tance from his lieutenants and found it painful to consider how this might end . Taking his hand , she asked , " Is today all you had hoped for ? " <p> Bobby summoned a small smile . " Do you see their eagerness , the joy on their faces ? For a day they are free of docility and fear . " He paused , then finished softly , " Were I to die right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> His faintly autumnal tone reminded Marissa of the gray flecks she had begun to notice in his hair , the deepening grooves in his face that betrayed that he was not only older than she , but suffering from an exhaustion he tried to conceal from the others . She grasped his hand more tightly . <p> For a mile they walked at the head of the Asari along a dirt road forged by PGL repair crews between mangroves and palm trees , the orange glow of flaring gas lighting their path . Then Bobby stopped abruptly . <p> Marissa followed his gaze . At a fork in the road ahead , three silhouettes hung from the thick branches of a tree , specters in the devil 's light . <p> Turning , Bobby held up his hand . The marchers fell quiet , save for cries of shock from those who saw what Bobby saw . " Wait here , " Bobby told Marissa . <p> But she did not . Together , they moved toward the tree , stopping only when the three shadows became corpses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strangulation had contorted their faces and suffused their eyes with blood . All were Luandian ; all wore denim shirts bearing the letters PGL . <p> Her stomach constricting , Marissa turned to Bobby . Tears shone in his eyes . " Now what will happen to us ? " he murmured . <p> A stirring in the grove of palms behind the corpses made Marissa flinch . The figure of a large man emerged , followed by three others . As the men stepped into the light , Marissa recognized the familiar uniform of Luandian soldiers and saw their leader 's face . <p> Instantly she felt herself recoil : though she knew him only by the patch over his right eye , by reputation Colonel Paul Okimbo was a mass murderer , a rapist , and , the survivors of Lana whispered , insane . Okimbo wore the eye patch , it was said , to conceal a walleye and , bizarrely , to evoke the Israeli general Moshe Dayan . Stopping beside the hanging bodies , he trained his remaining eye on Bobby , then Marissa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " This is your work , Bobby Okari . " <p> " No , " Bobby answered . " Not mine , and not ours . " <p> Okimbo emitted a bark of laughter . " So you say . But soon you will face the justice of Savior Karama . " <p> Marissa watched Bobby exert the full force of his will to meet Okimbo 's stare . A spurt of anger broke the col onel 's impassivity . " Unless the Asari withdraw at once , " he snapped , " there will be consequences . Some will die . " <p> Feeling the dampness on her forehead , Marissa saw the sheen of sweat on Bobby 's face . With palpable reluctance , he answered , " As you say . But this will not end here . " <p> " Of that you can rest assured , " Okimbo responded with the flicker of a smile . " I know two hundred ways of killing a man , and more men than that who deserve to die . " <p> To Marissa , the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby looked from Okimbo to the corpses , hanging with eerie stillness in the dense night air . <p> Seeing this , Okimbo placed his hand on the back of the body nearest him , idly shoving it toward Bobby as though propelling a child on a swing . As the dead man slowly swung between them , Okimbo said softly , " For you , hanging will do nicely .
