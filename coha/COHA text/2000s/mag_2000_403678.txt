/Jan 2000 New mother Sarah Dennison is not talking about childbirth . Nor is she commenting on the sleeplessness that 's delivered along with your newborn . She 's describing an aspect of motherhood that , yes , is beautiful and natural , but can also be unexpectedly frustrating : breastfeeding . For some moms , nursing seems effortless . But as Dennison and other mothers have found , sometimes it is n't so simple . Fortunately , most problems can either be prevented or solved with a little expert help . Here are some common breastfeeding problems and suggested ways to deal with them . Sore nipples Dennison recalls that her daughter , Isabella , seemed to eat well , but by the end of the first week , her nipples were " agonizing , " with " little chunks dug out of the skin , and some big painful cracks . " She suffered with this pain for about five weeks . " Isabella would start nursing , and I would just be bawling , " says the Hamilton , Ontario mom . " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was growing so well and gaining weight . " Sore nipples are , unfortunately , so common that many people think they are a normal part of breastfeeding . But as Evelyn Jain , a Calgary family physician and lactation consultant , points out , this pain is a clear sign that something is wrong . The most frequent cause of sore nipples is that the baby is not latched on properly . " Correct technique in latching is the kingpin to the whole thing , " explains Jain . " When the baby is really well positioned and really well latched on , damage to the nipples can be prevented . " Fixing the latch is also the first step in treating the problem . Often , once the baby is properly positioned , the pain will stop  --  or at least become bearable . Dennison recalls : " A nurse who was helping me kind of shoved the baby on , which seemed much rougher than the way I 'd been doing it  --  but Isabella got a big mouthful of breast , and to my surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Latch Made in Heaven , " p. 86 . ) Thrush Thrush can also cause sore nipples . Jain describes the discomfort thrush brings as " a burning nipple pain and shooting breast pains after the feedings . " Sometimes the baby will also show signs of the infection in his mouth  --  small , white patches inside his cheeks or on his tongue . Thrush is a yeast infection and is more common if the mother has had vaginal yeast infections during pregnancy , has been given antibiotics , or if the baby himself has thrush or a yeast diaper rash  --  a pimply rash that wo n't clear up with a simple barrier cream . It is also more likely to happen when the mother has damaged nipples , as Sarah Dennison discovered . " The cracks were just starting to heal up when I got the thrush , " she says . " It was a different kind of pain  --  almost a raw feeling . Fortunately , it cleared up quickly . " This problem always requires treatment , generally with a prescription antifungal cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotics ask for an antifungal cream to use on their nipples at the same time . Gentian violet is a non-prescription medication that is frequently effective against the yeast that causes thrush . Ask your pharmacist for a 0.5-percent solution without alcohol . The main disadvantage is that it stains everything it touches purple , so do n't use it while sitting on your bed with the new white comforter ( and undress yourself and your baby ) . Usually mothers first paint the inside of the baby 's mouth and lips with the gentian violet , then put the baby to the breast . By the end of the feeding , your baby 's mouth and lips and your nipples will all be purple . In a small percentage of babies , this medication will cause ulcers in the baby 's mouth . Discontinue the gentian violet if this happens . Engorgement If your breasts feel like two rocks sitting on your chest , and it hurts to even touch them , you 're probably engorged . This painful condition is common in the early days after birth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to nurse from the very full breasts . While engorgement may be common , Joan Fisher , a registered nurse and lactation consultant in Ottawa , says that it is due to the way our society usually manages birth and the early days of breastfeeding . " It should n't happen in a mother whose baby is feeding normally from birth onward . What often happens , though , is that women are given intravenous fluids during labour  --  with pitocin , or with an epidural  --  and when their milk ducts begin to fill as well , they end up with swollen tissue in the breasts . It 's like one big beaver dam and nothing can move . The baby can only get a little milk out . " It 's also important to nurse your baby frequently from birth on . " If the baby is not feeding well , the mother should hand-express or pump her milk , " says Fisher , " and this can be fed to the baby from a cup . " If the breasts are becoming full and firm , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-expression of milk to make the area around the nipple soft enough for the baby to get a good latch , and treatment with cold compresses or clean , raw cabbage leaves used as compresses . Breast infections ( mastitis ) Fisher describes the development of a breast infection this way : " When breastfeeding is going well , it is like a running brook . When it is not , it is like a stagnant pool . There are the same bacteria present in both situations , but in the stagnant pool they have a chance to multiply . " A breast infection is often linked to a poor latch , cracked nipples or a plugged milk duct . " The milk is pooling in the ducts , the bacteria get in and they have a picnic there waiting for them , " says Fisher . A too-tight bra or other restrictive clothing can cause a plugged duct . Or , a baby who suddenly drops a feeding or two will mean mom 's breasts become very full , and a plugged duct can result . Christy Perkins of Calgary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son , Kieran . The first episode , which happened when he was just a few weeks old , " started with a strange sensation in my breast , " she says . " I knew something was amiss . It was n't really pain , but I was soon very aware that there was a lump . My milk seemed to be not letting down well , and before long , the lump was bigger and painful to the touch . " Perkins eventually developed a breast infection : " That felt like I 'd been hit by a Mack truck  --  I had a fever and ached all over . It was awful . " The treatment that worked best for Perkins was to apply heat to the swollen area and encourage Kieran to nurse on that side while she massaged her breast . " In the middle of the night , he managed to suck that plug out and drain all the milk . It was such a relief ! " During that first bout , Perkins was given antibiotics , but even though she had more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as she felt the tender lumpy spot , she would begin applying heat and massaging the area , and encouraging her baby to nurse . " Antibiotics only cure the infection , " says Fisher . " They do n't solve the problem of keeping the milk moving . It 's important to address this , too , so that the infection does n't come back . " Slow weight gain The most common reason for a breastfed baby to be gaining too slowly , according to Jain , is a poor latch . " Watch to see that the baby is actually feeding , " she advises . " You should see the baby making big jaw movements  --  the baby 's mouth opens wide and pauses  --  and you may hear swallowing with each suck for a good part of the feeding . " The baby who just " nibbles " or makes small , fluttery sucks , is not latched on well and is not getting much milk . Another cause of slow weight gain can be restricting feedings . Fisher quotes a study from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One group was fed for an average of 20 minutes , seven times a day , and after two weeks , the babies had gained less than 1 oz. ( 25 g ) per day . The second group nursed for an average of 14 minutes ten times daily . In total feeding time , they spent just one minute longer at the breast than the group that nursed less frequently  --  but gained 1 1/2 oz. ( 40 g ) per day . " Longer feedings are not as beneficial as shorter , more frequent feedings , " Fisher explains . She tells mothers that their babies may nurse at least eight to ten times in 24 hours , but not to expect this to be on a schedule . More typically , babies will cluster several feedings close together , then sleep for a couple of hours . " A baby should never be kept waiting for a feed , " Jain adds . " If the baby is hungry he should be fed . It might be every hour during the evening , or the baby might wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the signs that a baby is not getting enough milk : fewer than six soaking-wet diapers in 24 hours after the first week of life ; less than one bowel movement per day in a baby under four to six weeks old ; a lethargic or sleepy baby ; and insufficient weight again ( this will vary depending on the baby ) . If any of these signs are present , contact a doctor quickly . Too much milk " This can be a very confusing situation , " says Jain . " The baby seems to be wanting to nurse all the time , fusses and squirms at the breast , and is gassy and hard to settle . Often the mother is concerned that she does n't have enough milk , but there are lots of wet diapers and bowel movements , and when the baby is weighed , he is gaining well . " Other clues to look for : milk that drips from the other nipple while the baby is nursing ; milk that sprays out when the baby lets go ; and watery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much milk , too fast , " explains Jain . " It is often called overactive milk ejection reflex , or overactive letdown . " Her recommendation : Try giving your baby just one breast at each feeding , for as long as the baby wants . At the next feeding , offer the other . If the breast not being used becomes uncomfortably full , use cold compresses or cabbage leaves to reduce engorgement . Breast refusal It can be devastating to a new mother , enthusiastic about breastfeeding , if her brand-new baby turns away from the breast , clamps that tiny mouth shut or simply cries when held in the nursing position . Fisher says this should n't be taken personally . It 's possible , she says , that babies refuse the breast because they have had a negative experience . A baby who was vigorously suctioned after birth , for example , might not want to open his mouth and risk another painful experience . Or a baby who has a difficult delivery may have a headache that was made worse by someone trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never push the baby 's head towards the breast anyway , " says Fisher . " When you push on the baby 's head , you close the baby 's jaw and lose that wide-open gape that is essential for a good latch . Instead , your hand  --  or the hand of the person helping you  --  should be supporting the baby 's shoulders and neck . " If the baby is already refusing the breast , Fisher suggests " be very gentle . You have to talk the baby through it . Your baby already knows your voice from before birth and will be reassured by hearing you . Calm your baby , then try the breast again . If he cries , calm him down again , then bring him back to the breast . " Some mothers have had success by getting into a warm bath with the baby . Babies can also become confused about how to get on the breast if they have had bottles or pacifiers . " Gaping widely is part of the normal rooting reflex , " explains Fisher . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breast , with the nipple well back in his mouth . When we give babies pacifiers and bottles , they learn to have a small mouth and to pull their tongues back behind the nipple . That does n't work when they come to the breast . " It is helpful to avoid giving babies artificial nipples , at least in the early weeks while they are still learning the techniques of breastfeeding and the mother 's milk supply is being established . Older babies who have been nursing well will , on occasion , suddenly refuse the breast . This is called a nursing strike . It can begin when something causes the infant pain while nursing ( such as an ear infection ) or if he is startled or upset at the breast . Some babies have gone on nursing strikes because their mothers changed deodorant and they did n't like the new scent . Often these little ones will nurse when they are asleep or just drifting off , or if held in a different position .

Lactation consultants Look for the credentials IBCLC , which stands for International Board Certified Lactation Consultants . This title is given to people who meet the criteria for experience in helping breastfeeding mothers , pass the qualifying exam and continue to educate themselves about breastfeeding . Public health nurses Many of these professionals have extra training to help mothers with breastfeeding , and some public health departments also have organized support groups . Hospital-based breastfeeding clinics Check with your community hospital to see if a breastfeeding clinic is available . Ask who staffs the clinic  --  an IBCLC is preferable . A Latch Made in Heaven In a good latch , the baby has his mouth open wide and lips curled outwards , his bottom lip covers more of the breast than his top lip , and he is not causing his mother any pain . But how do you achieve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . Paediatrician Jack Newman , who offers breastfeeding clinics in several Toronto hospitals , says the " cross cradle " hold works well with a new baby , although he adds that other positions can also work . To put your baby to your left breast in the " cross cradle " hold , hold him in your right arm . The baby 's body lies along your forearm , and you support his head with your hand . The webbed area between your thumb and forefinger should be at the nape of the baby 's neck , and your thumb and fingers stay behind his ears . The baby 's body is wrapped around yours , tummy to tummy , and his feet and legs are tucked under your right arm . With your left hand , support your breast  --  your fingers underneath the breast and your thumb on top , well back from the areola . The baby 's head should be tilted slightly backwards , and you should move him towards the breast using your entire arm , not just your hand  --  so that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once he is in this position , you can lightly brush the baby 's upper lip with your nipple , from one corner of the baby 's mouth to the other . " Wait for the baby to open his mouth widely , like a yawn , " Newman says , " and when he does , use your arm to bring the baby onto the breast . " As the baby starts to nurse , you should not feel any pain . At the beginning of the feeding , the baby may do a series of short , rapid sucks to encourage the milk to let down , but you should soon see him making large sucking motions with a pause each time he opens his mouth wide . That pause means he 's got a mouthful of milk and is swallowing it . With some babies , you can even hear them swallowing another good sign that the baby is nursing well . <p>
