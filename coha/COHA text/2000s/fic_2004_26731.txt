They told me there 'd be palm trees . I did n't believe them , but that 's what they told me . They told me I 'd be able to see them from the plane . Oh , I know they have palm trees in southern California . I mean , I 'm not a complete moron . I 've watched 90210 , and everything . But I was moving to northern California . I did n't expect to see palm trees in northern California . Not after my mom told me not to give away all my sweaters . " Oh , no , " my mom had said . " You 'll need them . Your coats , too . It can get cold there . Not as cold as New York , maybe , but pretty chilly . " Which was why I wore my black leather motorcycle jacket on the plane . I could have shipped it , I guess , with the rest of my stuff , but it kind of made me feel better to wear it . So there I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle jacket , seeing these palm trees through the window as we landed . And I thought , Great . Black leather and palm trees . Already I 'm fitting in , just like I knew I would . . . . . . . Not . My mom is n't particularly fond of my leather jacket , but I swear I did n't wear it to make her mad , or anything . I 'm not resentful of the fact that she decided to marry a guy who lives three thousand miles away , forcing me to leave school in the middle of my sophomore year ; abandon the best -- and pretty much only -- friend I 've had since kindergarten ; leave the city I 've been living in for all of my sixteen years . Oh , no . I 'm not a bit resentful . The thing is , I really do like Andy , my new stepdad . He 's good for my mom . He makes her happy . And he 's very nice to me . It 's just this moving-to-California thing that bugs me . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They were all there to greet me when I got off the plane . My mom , Andy , and Andy 's three sons . Sleepy , Dopey , and Doc , I call them . They 're my new stepbrothers . " Susie ! " Even if I had n't heard my mom squealing my name as I walked through the gate , I would n't have missed them -- my new family . Andy was making his two youngest boys hold up this big sign that said welcome home , susannah ! Everybody getting off my flight was walking by it , going , " Aw , look how cute , " to their travel companions , and smiling at me in this sickening way . Oh , yeah . I 'm fitting in . I 'm fitting in just great . " Okay , " I said , walking up to my new family fast . " You can put the sign down now . " But my mom was too busy hugging me to pay any attention . " Oh , Susie ! " she kept saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I shot the boys this mean look over her shoulder , just in case they were getting any big ideas . They just kept grinning at me from over the stupid sign , Dopey because he 's too dumb to know any better , Doc because -- well , I guess because he might have been glad to see me . Doc 's weird that way . Sleepy , the oldest , just stood there , looking . . . well , sleepy . " How was your flight , kiddo ? " Andy took my bag off my shoulder , and put it on his own . He seemed surprised by how heavy it was , and went , " Whoa , what 've you got in here , anyway ? You know it 's a felony to smuggle New York City fire hydrants across state lines . " I smiled at him . Andy 's this really big goof , but he 's a nice big goof . He would n't have the slightest idea what constitutes a felony in the state of New York since he 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incidentally , exactly how many visits it took him to convince my mother to marry him . " It 's not a fire hydrant , " I said . " It 's a parking meter . And I have four more bags . " " Four ? " Andy pretended he was shocked . " What do you think you 're doing , moving in or something ? " Did I mention that Andy thinks he 's a comedian ? He 's not . He 's a carpenter . " Suze , " Doc said , all enthusiastically . " Suze , did you notice that as you were landing , the tail of the plane kicked up a little ? That was from an updraft . It 's caused when a mass moving at a considerable rate of speed encounters a counter-blowing wind velocity of equal or greater strength . " Doc , Andy 's youngest kid , is twelve , but he 's going on about forty . He spent almost the entire wedding reception telling me about alien cattle mutilation , and how Area 51 is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want us to know that We Are Not Alone . " Oh , Susie , " my mom kept saying . " I 'm so glad you 're here . You 're just going to love the house . It just did n't feel like home at first , but now that you 're here . . . Oh , and wait until you 've seen your room . Andy 's fixed it up so nice . . . . " Andy and my mom spent weeks before they got married looking for a house big enough for all four kids to have their own rooms . They finally settled on this huge house in the hills of Carmel , which they 'd only been able to afford because they 'd bought it in this completely wretched state , and this construction company Andy does a lot of work for fixed it up at this big discount rate . My mom has been going on for days about my room , which she keeps swearing is the nicest one in the house . " The view ! " she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window in your room ! Oh , Suze , you 're going to love it . " I was sure I was going to love it . About as much as I was going to love giving up bagels for alfalfa sprouts , and the subway for surfing , and all that sort of stuff . Continues ...
