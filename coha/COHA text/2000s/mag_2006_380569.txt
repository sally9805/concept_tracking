Poor Lucy . Five months after setting up shop in Sin City , jilting suitors around the country in favor of a sugar daddy who courted her with a new $40 million home , she discovers the fleeting nature of Las Vegas romance . A sultry soap opera ? Political scandal ? No  --  just the harsh reality of Broadway in Vegas . <P> The character known as Lucy the Slut is a puppet in the Tony Award  --  winning musical Avenue Q , which has been playing in the Wynn Las Vegas hotel since last fall . Casino magnate Steve Wynn offered Avenue Q 's producers a theater and $5 million up front for an exclusive run in Vegas , in exchange for ditching the usual cross-country tour . " I wanted something completely different , " says Wynn . " No hydraulics . No feathers . No fuss . Just simple theatrical wit . " <P> Wit is no match for gloss in Vegas . Wynn canceled Avenue Q 's run last month and will replace it with the splashier musical Monty Python 's Spamalot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater industry , which watched anxiously as show after show headed for Vegas , Q 's failure is both lesson and opportunity . For some shows , maybe Seattle beats Vegas . <P> While Avenue Q was the first and only show to eschew a national tour and put all its money on Vegas , musicals like Spamalot and Hairspray are excluding or limiting play in competing markets , such as Nevada , California and Arizona . The Vegas focus " has been an awakening for the industry , " says Pat Halloran , president of the Independent Presenters Network , a group of 55 theater owners , operators and presenters . <P> Halloran 's group put up $1 million toward Spamalot 's Las Vegas run , but part of the deal is that the show will tour elsewhere . " After Avenue Q , we all became a little smarter , " Halloran explains . In the best of all worlds , a hot Las Vegas run spills over into good buzz for touring shows . The Abba tribute Mamma Mia ! , for example , rakes in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment in three years . Its success feeds audiences elsewhere . <P> Good buzz was n't enough for Avenue Q. Producer Kevin McCollum says he believed Wynn 's up-front backing would take " much of the risk out of the equation for us . " For a regular tour , he would have faced traveling expenses of $50,000 a week . But success is measured differently in Vegas . " Body count is as important or more important than your gross potential , " says Michael Gill , general manager of Vegas ' Mamma Mia ! Word of mouth for the off-kilter show ( Avenue Q features a gaggle of foulmouthed puppets ) was n't enough to fill its 1,200-seat venue , which is 1 1/2 times the size of Avenue Q 's Broadway home . Casinos expect shows to draw people into their hotel rooms , gaming , restaurants and nightclubs , so they want to see packed houses . Avenue Q turned a profit but could n't fill the house , averaging 50% capacity . Wynn says Spamalot has a better chance of selling out the $40 million palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a Broadway hit like Hairspray has to make compromises : an abridged , intermission-free version opened last month at Luxor , and the casino expects it to re-energize the 12-year-old pyramidal playground . <P> Avenue Q , for its part , is hoping for a second chance . Its producers sent " kiss and make up " cards to tour presenters  --  they 'll be hitting the road after all .
