Ask any fashionista to name her favorite brand , and chances are you never heard of it before . Does Bella Dahl ring a bell ? Or Ballroom ? The Reeds or the Wrights ? You may have a closet crammed with Gucci stilettos and Prada backpacks , and you may even know how to pronounce Nicholas Ghesquiere 's last name , but these days if you really want to hug the trends , you need to have some hot little label that nobody 's heard of . In the new millennium , it 's the small , unknown fashion brands that are wielding power and influence over both the consumer and the bigger global brands . <P> This season the buzz is all about a new line of jeans called Habitual , the brainchild of Nicole Garrett , a former fashion editor , and her fiance Michael Colovos . Habitual jeans ' subtle washes and tailored details such as welt pockets and bound buttonholes have become the overnight favorites of models like Gisele Bundchen and Carolyn Murphy . The jeans are so hot that Barney 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are rumored to have Levi 's creative team in a tizzy . Of course , Levi 's is a 130-year-old multibillion-dollar global brand , and Habitual is a shoestring outfit based in a studio in New York City 's Hell 's Kitchen . " A lot of innovation credit is being given to the small brands , " says Robert Hanson , Levi 's brand president . " We compete with them collectively . But we 're seeing these brands take Levi 's vintage styles and modernize them . " Nevertheless , Levi 's has taken some lumps from tiny jeans operations like Earl . And in a depressed retail market , the smaller fashion brands and boutiques are posting gains as bigger brands languish on shelves . <P> Call it the revenge of fashion 's little guys . <P> " The ' 90s were about uniform dressing , and the decisions the consumer was making were very much brand oriented , " says Jaqui Lividini , senior vice president for fashion at Saks Fifth Avenue . " When we turned the millennium , the whole fashion vocabulary changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became all about individuality . Now she wants to be the first one on the block to discover a new label . " <P> Perhaps the small-brand upsurge reflects a backlash against the homogeny of the Gap-Starbucks culture . Or maybe big brands are the victim of their own excess , their flamboyantly advertised labels signifying not a sense of style so much as a slavishness to trends . Hip consumers seem to have caught a new scent and are turning to smaller boutiques like Scoop in New York City and Colette in Paris . <P> When Christiane Celle , the French owner of a boutique called Calypso on St. Bart 's in the French West Indies , migrated north to New York 's Nolita neighborhood in 1994 , her bright and breezy peasant blouses ushered in a casual new uniform for skinny models , stylists , socialites and starlets . Paired with low-slung jeans and crocheted hip belts , the bohemian look seemed to symbolize liberation from the tyranny of all Gucci or Prada all the time . Soon designers like Tom Ford caught the bohemian bug , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vogue 's September 2001 cover with a label that read Yves Saint Laurent .
