Paul Bremer strode into the sweltering Iraqi capital of Baghdad last week , sounding to all the world like the new sheriff in town  --  albeit one wearing a suit and tie . For a city racked by instability and violence , President Bush 's newly appointed civilian chief promised a new , no-nonsense approach to law and order . Referring to the thousands of criminals Saddam Hussein freed before the war , the seasoned diplomat and counterterrorism expert declared , " It 's time we put these people back in jail . " <P> But after the first month of U.S. occupation of Iraq , it 's clear that bringing security  --  to say nothing of democracy  --  to a broken country is more easily pledged than done . Bremer 's predecessor , retired Lieut . General Jay Garner , fared so poorly from the start that one of his own underlings in Iraq , career diplomat Barbara Bodine , sounded the alarm . She dashed off scathing reports to colleagues back in Washington warning that he was in danger of losing the peace , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humanitarian and Reconstruction Assistance ( OHRA ) .

But there has been a fearsome jump in crime . Carjackings , lootings , robberies , arson and rapes have become the order of the day  --  and night . Automatic gunfire provides an unsettling sound track for daily life . The threat of violence makes parents afraid to send their kids to school , merchants wary of opening their stores and law-abiding Iraqis nervous about going out after dark . The Americans have tried to blame pro-Saddam saboteurs for the collapse of order . Lieut . General David McKiernan , head of the U.S. land forces in Iraq , said last week that Baghdad 's breakdown was largely the result of an organized resistance engineered by Saddam loyalists . But other military officials say this is secondary to the main issue : restoring the minimum quality of life for ordinary Iraqis  --  a job , electricity , proper sewage , safe streets .
