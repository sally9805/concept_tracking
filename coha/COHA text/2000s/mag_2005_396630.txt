Homing in on an alga 's threat-and therapeutic promise <p> On a warm , sunny day , you can hear the presence of a " red tide " of toxic algae on popular Florida beaches , says Barbara Kirkpatrick . It 's not the roar of coastal waves or the gurgle of flowing water , she explains , but " one continuous cough , " as thousands of sunbathers and swimmers respond to airborne irritants that the algae expel in the surf . <p> Kirkpatrick , manager of environmental health at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota , Fla. , heard the sound last February when she visited Siesta Key Beach . Southwest Florida was in the throes of a red tide-in this case , a misnomer because the alga causing it , Karenia brevis , turns water yellow-green . Some traditional signs of the bloom were in evidence on beaches and in canals . Most obviously , manatees were dying . By the end of spring , officials had retrieved more than 4 dozen sea cow carcasses , weighing up to 1,000 pounds apiece . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat local shellfish . It 's long been known that their accumulated K. brevis toxins can cause vomiting , diarrhea , excessive urination , and a temporary reversal of temperature sensation-ice feels hot and near-boiling water feels frigid . <p> But new concerns are accompanying the latest K. brevis bloom because scientists have recently uncovered far wider health effects of the algal toxins . <p> Five years ago , in response to a rising incidence of red tides , the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences began sponsoring research into how K. brevis toxins , called brevetoxins , function . The findings , announced this spring in more than a dozen papers and scientific talks , are largely disquieting . They show that the alga 's poisons have several means of wreaking havoc beyond the neurotoxicity that had been previously recognized . <p> On a more positive note , this research has also revealed that along with its toxins , K. brevis produces counteracting agents . Scientists are working to harness these novel compounds as antidotes to brevetoxins or even as treatments for unrelated lung diseases , such as cystic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a microscopic poison factory churning out 9 to 13 different toxins . Wave action readily ruptures the cells , turning the water along coastlines or in a tidal canal into a poisonous soup that can kill fish , sea turtles , and marine mammals such as manatees and dolphins . Birds can die after eating tainted prey . Filter-feeding shellfish , such as mussels , accumulate brevetoxins without harm , but their flesh can poison animals , including people , that eat it . <p> The recent spate of research has clarified these neurotoxic effects . These studies trace to the toxins ' effect on sodium channels in nerves , explains Daniel G. Baden of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington 's Center for Marine Science . Normally , the channels open momentarily to pass a signal along a nerve cell . <p> Brevetoxins " act like little doorstops , " Baden says . " Once the sodium channel opens , they keep it open , " incapacitating the cell . <p> In March at the Society of Toxicology meeting in New Orleans , Baden reported that in the rodent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that affects cognitive function , breathing , and muscle control . If the same happens in manatees , he says , it might explain their disorientation and seeming inability to swim away from a red tide . <p> Bad as the neurotoxic effect might be , Baden 's team unveiled at the meeting three new mechanisms of brevetoxin poisoning-detrimental changes in lung function , immunity , and DNA . Aspects of the first two might explain respiratory distress , which is the most prevalent symptom that the algae trigger in people . <p> As mucus clears from an animal 's airways , it removes pollutants and debris . Small doses of the toxins reduced the clearance rate of mucus by 35 percent in sheep . This impairment lasted about 2 hours , notes research-team member William M. Abraham , a pulmonary physiologist at Mt . Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach , Fla . <p> The scientists ' studies also showed that the poisons attack the sheep immune system . White blood cells called neutrophils ordinarily protect the body by entering the lungs , gobbling up the poisons and the cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham says that in sheep exposed to brevetoxins , however , neutrophils stick around , causing inflammation of the airways . <p> Another group of immune cells , macrophages , normally removes germs , damaged cells , and other debris from the lungs . In brevetoxin-exposed sheep , however , macrophages ' destruction of trash fell by about 30 percent . This effect persisted for days . <p> Baden notes that his team 's experiments in mice showed that brevetoxins can also depress an animal 's response to infection by inactivating cathepsins , enzymes that immune cells use to break down debris as they attack it . <p> Finally , he and Abraham reported in March that brevetoxins induced significant DNA damage in lab cultures of human lymphocytes , which are white blood cells active in immunity . <p> TICKLISH SITUATION " Most people in Florida have experienced what we call the red tide tickle , " says Cynthia Heil of the state 's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg . " It 's kind of a back-of-the-throat , **28;4843;TOOLONG feeling . " <p> People are n't alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying the manatees killed by the recent K. brevis tide ( see " Marine Mystery , " below ) . <p> Gregory D. Bossart , a veterinarian and pathologist at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Fort Pierce , Fla. , studied a similar die-off of manatees in a 1996 red tide . By treating tissues from dead animals with antibodies that stain the toxins , he and his colleagues pegged inhalation as a primary route of the poisons . <p> " We were able to trace the brevetoxins from their nasal cavities down to the lymph nodes and spleen , " he says . " They were all loaded with toxin , " and there were smaller amounts in the animals ' brains and livers , says Bossart . <p> In healthy people , Kirkpatrick notes , upper-airway symptoms are transitory . Indeed , she monitored some 28 healthy lifeguards before and after their work shifts . She examined the young men and women on 5 consecutive days during which the air was largely free of brevetoxins and on 5 consecutive days marked by moderate air concentrations-ranging from 3 to 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the May Environmental Health Perspectives ( EHP ) , Kirkpatrick 's team reports that the guards exhibited significantly more teary eyes , stuffy noses , and coughing on red tide days . However , the guards could still breathe deeply , even during 5 minutes of mild exercise on the beach . Moreover , their symptoms disappeared shortly after the guards entered an air-conditioned room . <p> On the other hand , red tide toxins can exert a choke hold on people with lung disease , Kirkpatrick 's team reports in a second May EHP paper . The researchers evaluated lung function in 59 people who have asthma and take antiasthma drugs . Data were collected before and after these participants spent an hour on a beach with airborne brevetoxin concentrations of 3 to 36 ng/m3 . <p> These volunteers reacted far more strongly to the algae 's lung irritants than did the lifeguards , none of whom had asthma . While on the beach , the people with asthma experienced not only the upper-airway effects seen in the guards , but also chest tightness , wheezing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asthma contacted Kirkpatrick after the testing to report feeling even worse on the day following their hour at the beach . Abraham says that he is n't surprised . He 's seen similar persistent effects in sheep induced to have a condition that serves as a model of human asthma . <p> In one study , Abraham administered 20 breaths of air laced with a brevetoxin to asthmatic ewes on 4 consecutive days . Air concentrations of the toxin were at the low end of what the recruits encountered in Kirkpatrick 's beach tests . <p> The exposures rendered the animals ' airways " more twitchy than normal , " says Abraham . When the animals inhaled an irritant , the airways constricted erratically , he reported in the May EHP . This heightened responsiveness to brevetoxins lasted a week . <p> In people , such airway hypersensitivity contributes to a feeling of chest tightness , he explains . <p> HELP IS COMING Terrence P. Kane , a Sarasota , Fla. , pulmonologist , and his colleagues have their own way of knowing when red tide toxins have become airborne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining that their prescribed drugs for those conditions are n't working . Kane says that the medications actually become overwhelmed by the onslaught of brevetoxins- " So , we may have to change their drug regimen . " <p> The sheep studies have identified at least four classes of drugs as especially effective against the toxins ' bronchial symptoms . <p> In the May EHP , Abraham and his colleagues report that albuterol was the most effective agent that they tested . With this inhalable antiasthma drug , airway constriction in the sheep was about a quarter of what it was with no drug . Even the least effective agent tested , the antihistamine diphenhydramine , prevented about half the constriction . <p> However , therapeutics that fight even more of brevetoxins ' effects may be on the horizon . Their source could be K. brevis itself . <p> A couple of years ago , when Baden 's team was isolating toxins from K. brevis cells , it turned up something new . In the January Journal of Natural Products , the researchers named the odd chemical brevenal . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variants of this chemical from the alga . What makes these brevenals interesting , says Baden , is that when administered to animals , all three prevent brevetoxins ' damaging effects on nerves , lungs , and DNA . <p> These natural and strikingly potent antidotes bind to the same receptors on cells that brevetoxins target . " Receptor binding is dynamic , " Baden explains , with compounds continually attaching and then letting go . " It 's like musical chairs , " the biochemist says , likening the receptors to the chairs . " So , the more brevenals you have relative to toxin , the less chance a toxin can get into one of those chairs " and harm cells . <p> Brevenals may also explain the decrease in the severity of health effects on people and animals in a coastal area during the course of a red tide . Algae tend to produce more of the antidotes as a bloom matures , Baden explains . <p> His team recently applied for a patent on brevenals , and " we 're working with a local industry to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug company , aaiPharma of Wilmington , N.C. , foresees developing products to prevent the effects of the brevetoxins in people with compromised lungs . Workers , such as beach-cleanup or fishing crews , who endure regular exposure to red tide toxins might also benefit . <p> But Baden says that the company 's primary interest in brevenals goes beyond concerns about red tides . People with cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experience a slowdown of lung-mucus clearance similar to that in brevetoxin-exposed sheep . The company is designing drugs to restore normal mucus clearance from the lungs , as the brevenals do . <p> These algal agents or drugs derived from them might also find use combating algal toxins far beyond southwest Florida . Baden 's group recently showed that an alga unrelated to K. brevis produces brevetoxins . The alga , currently known as Chattonella cf. verruculosa , was initially isolated in Delaware waters 5 years ago during a massive fish kill . <p> Scientists have recently identified Karenia species other than K. brevis in Japan and New Zealand . Although their toxicity is only beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep , agents from at least one of the species induce bronchoconstriction and respiratory distress . <p> Such findings suggest that brevetoxins might pose health risks-and that brevenals may be useful to combat them-around the world . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : RED IN NAME ONLY Because Karenia brevis cells ( inset ) are n't red , substantial blooms of the microscopic algae create a " red tide " that 's actually a muddy yellow-green or brown . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : TRAPPED BY TOXINS Manatees often ca n't evade brevetoxins when red-tide algae infest the warm haunts that the marine mammals need to survive during the winter . <p> By Janet Raloff <p> Marine Mystery Die-offs of manatees and dolphins in red tides prove perplexing <p> Manatees , the shy and docile mascots of towns around Florida 's Gulf Coast , are experiencing a serious die-off . The current body count-55-is roughly 4 percent of southwest Florida 's population of these endangered marine mammals . Most of the deaths are being attributed to an ongoing red tide of Karenia brevis . <p> This bloom began last January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to coastal inlets , bays , and the mouths of rivers , where boaters began reporting dead manatees in March . K. brevis blooms in Florida can last from 30 days to 18 months . <p> The state retrieves each manatee carcass to study the cause of death . Because most bodies were recovered in areas hit by the algal bloom , observes Elsa M. Haubold of the State of Florida 's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute , her team had little doubt what it would find : classic but nonspecific internal damage , such as tissues weeping blood . She notes that this occurs because the blood often does n't coagulate in brevetoxin-poisoned manatees . <p> An antibody-based test for brevetoxins is confirming the poisons ' presence in vital manatee tissues and body fluids . Physicians use similar antibody-based tests to diagnose various diseases in people . <p> Still , understanding how the algal compounds kill remains a challenge , notes veterinarian Greg Bossart of Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Fort Pierce , Fla. , who developed the brevetoxin test . He and other scientists used to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bossart now reports that the algal poisoning is n't only neurological . <p> In many instances , chronic inhalation of brevetoxins contributes to the destruction of red blood cells , resulting in severe anemia . This can lead to lung hemorrhages during which the animals " drown in their own fluids , " Bossart says . He likens the condition to the human infection known as toxic shock syndrome . <p> However , inhalation is hardly the only route of poisoning . In 2002 , months after a red tide had come and gone , nearly 3 dozen manatees died after entering their spring feeding grounds south of Sarasota , Fla . Some of them died abruptly , with their mouths still full of sea grass . <p> Leanne Flewelling of the state 's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute headed a team that used Bossart 's then-new antibody test to identify large amounts of brevetoxins adhering to sea grass the manatees had been eating . <p> The researchers ' findings , reported in the June 9 Nature , might explain some manatee deaths this year . Several animals succumbed while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high concentrations of brevetoxins in fish swimming in an area that was previously a red tide zone . " Until now , " the authors note , " it was uncertain whether live fish could accumulate and transfer lethal amounts of brevetoxins , " because even relatively low concentrations of these poisons usually kill fish . <p> The finding of brevetoxins in fish offers a dietary explanation for the deaths last year of 107 bottlenose dolphins off Florida 's Panhandle . Flewelling and her colleagues propose that tainted fish poisoned the dolphins . <p>
