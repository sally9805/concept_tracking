Windsor family is n't perfect is a headline that goes back so many generations , it has lost its shock value . But after the British tabloid News of the World revealed that PRINCE HARRY , 17 , third in line to the throne , had spent last summer boozing it up at a local pub and smoking cannabis both there and on the grounds of Highgrove , his dad 's country home 100 miles from London , the media have gnawed on the story like a Labrador retriever with a steak bone . Like so many royal tales before it , Harry 's travails offer hacks an irresistible chance to slalom between salivating prurience ( was he having sex too ? ) and tongue-clucking high-mindedness ( how hard this must be on the poor Queen ! ) . <P> The known facts : after exams last summer , with Dad in London on business and big brother William on a year abroad , Harry was sometimes left home alone at Highgrove . Though two years under age , he drank at a local pub , often achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was nothing new for Harry , who has been drinking in public since he was 12 . He and his friends would continue in the soundproof basement lair maintained for the princes at Highgrove called Club H , which had a well-stocked bar .

Even his determined campaign to accustom the country ( and his mother ) to the wifelike status of Camilla Parker Bowles takes second place to burnishing his paternal image . Charles ' aides were savvy enough to cooperate once the News of the World sought confirmation for its newest scoop , which meant his thoughtful handling of Harry and the drug-clinic visit got a lot more ink than Club H 's bar and Charles ' ignorance of his son 's vigorous social life . COURAGE OF A WISE AND LOVING DAD was the paper 's main editorial , widely echoed in the British press . <P> It helps Charles that virtually every British parent is instinctively sympathetic . Illegal drug use is higher in Britain than in any other European country . Smoking pot is so widespread ( almost 40% of those 15 to 34 have tried it , according to the latest European Union report ) that the government plans to decriminalize possession of small amounts .
