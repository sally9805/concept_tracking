He currently works as the Production Manager for a MultiMedia company in Tucson , Arizona . As the proud father of two young daughters , he says that most stories he reads these days are by Dr. Seuss . His own debut as a professional storyteller is a gentle fantasy that reminds us that stories always matter , regardless of bow big or small you might be . <p> A DELIA DECIDED ONE DAY that the Dell in the Hills was too small for her . She had grown five-span over the last year , making her taller than the tallest Miller and stronger than the strongest Iron-Weaver , both of whom had battled giants during the Fell Winters in the longer days of their youth . Since size and strength are truly reflections of inner heart , the Dell Folk openly praised Adelia 's skill with axe and anvil and sword . But secretly they laughed when she could no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs under the dinner table , or even stand up straight in her own mother 's kitchen . Such is the bloom of jealousy in small hearts , and that is how Adelia knew that it was time to say good-bye . Perhaps Adelia did n't really mind that much , for she had always aspired to become a giant-slayer , a champion for the smallest of people and destroyer of monsters laying waste to villages . She dreamed of wearing a cape made of a giant 's woven hair and strapping her sword on with a belt made of a giant 's leathery skin . With such size and strength there was no more noble service to the Land than that of giant-slayer . And no greater glory . Adelia said good-bye to her mother , who was the only person who did n't want to see Adelia leave . Adelia 's mother was a small woman of the glens from Downland , a weaver by trade , and her small size was her source of motivation , for she took pride in the pain it gave her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pain , much less share in it . When Adelia left , so , too , did her mother 's hope that Adelia would ever come to discover the strength and dignity found in the heart of a small woman . Now , it happens that a giant had n't been seen among the Dell Folk for many seasons , so Adelia traveled Upland , among the other various Folk , and everywhere she went she asked , " Where is a giant that I may slay ? " And the Folk told her that the giants all dwelt farther Upland , in the realm of Gantica , and rarely came Downland these days . So farther Upland she ventured in search of Gantica , and she skirted the Lakes of Sorrow , where the Lonely Giant had shed tears to fill all the valleys and the dales . She crossed the twin rivers Fantis and Gantis , made by the long meandering wagon wheels of the Lost Giant . And she cautiously skirted the Burial Hills , where many a Wicked Giant had been killed in the Fell Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in sun and rain . The day came in the land of the Plains Folk that berries and nuts were hardly enough to quell the rumble in Adelia 's stomach . She met a poor farmer who gave her a meal of mutton and ale in return for help in fencing his ox stables . The farmer , unfortunately , had seen no giants that she might slay . Farther Upland she plowed another farmer 's fields in return for a week 's worth of venison . Then she helped dig a well for the farmer 's son . In a month she had raised several barns and thatched several cabins , and by the end of summer Adelia had helped harvest many fields of brittlecorn and pig-wheat and golden-eared fur-flax . All the Plains Folk that Adelia helped were small , and they seemed smaller with each passing day . But since Small Folk were not so good at helping themselves , Adelia took pride in bartering her size and strength to aid them in their daily tasks . And with all this work Adelia herself continued to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Folk standing on the shoulders of another , and her popularity in the Land grew , and her reputation spread before her . For the Mountain Folk , Adelia helped quarry granite and mine copperstone ; for the Wood Folk , Adelia helped fell trees and mill them into lumber ; for the River Folk , Adelia helped dam rapids and sculpt ship-slips out of riverbanks . In each part of the Land Adelia asked , " Where is a giant I may slay ? " And the Folk told her there were no giants here to slay , for they all dwelt farther Upland , in the realm of Gantica , and rarely came Downland these days . But in the meantime there were plenty of bridges to build and roads to clear . The days passed and Adelia grew , and the Folk of the Land praised her strength and size . But now behind her back they also grumbled about how much fruit she ate and griped about how much cotton it took to make clothes big enough to fit her , and sometimes they found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelia could do herself . The farther Upland she ventured the less friendly the Folk became , until the Fen Folk refused her passage across their border bogs , and the Prairie Folk ran from the fields and shut themselves deep underground in their burrowed homes . Adelia did n't quite understand this change until one morning she awoke from sleep in a quiet glade to a small cry of challenge , and found a tiny woman perched on her chest , sword raised in defiance . " Upon the bones of my fallen ancestors , " the little woman proclaimed , " today shall be your last day in the Land , foul beast of Gantica ! Prepare to meet the vengeance that shall seal thy doom ! " And the woman brought her sword down , but it barely put a dimple in Adelia 's shirt . Adelia picked the girl up and held the little figure up to her face , and Adelia realized in horror that this woman thought she was a giant , and was trying to kill her . This shocked Adelia , and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Upland , as far as she could . Suddenly she no longer cared about vengeance or fame or size or strength , and certain horrible questions would not leave her alone : Was she , Adelia , really a giant ? Was this what it meant to be a giant , alone and hunted in the far reaches of the Land ? Adelia was now afraid to approach any of the Small Folk , perhaps in fear of persecution , perhaps in fear of what truths they might reveal . She dared not return home to the Dell , not with her source of pride now suddenly her source of shame . In fact , if she were truly a giant , then perhaps Gantica was the only place she would ever find answers to her questions . So Upland she reluctantly continued , homesick and confused , her destination somehow still the same , if not her motivation . It was in this sparsely populated realm that Adelia finally met her first giant . Or perhaps it was more accurate to say another giant , though Adelia was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat hunched over a small instrument , a fiddle , and wiped tears from the corners of his eyes . " Why are you so sad ? " Adelia asked . The giant replied , " The fiddle was my Ufe , and now .... " He tried to draw the bow across the strings , but his fingers were too large , and the only sound was a weak scraping of wood on wood . Adelia took the pieces from him , and though she could barely handle them properly herself , she managed a few pure notes that brought a smile to the Fiddle Giant 's eyes . When the sweet sounds faded , Adelia asked the giant if he came from Gantica , but he said he did not , and only knew that it existed somewhere farther Upland . It was not long before Adelia encountered the Family Giant , who had a wife and two children , but could no longer live with them , not because he was too big , but because his mere presence brought threats and jealousy and prejudice to them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Adelia of his wife and children , and so Adelia listened for a time to the love and pride in his voice , and she somehow felt him lucky to have such a family to miss . Before leaving , Adelia asked of Gantica , but the Family Giant only knew that it existed farther Upland , and he could tell her nothing more . Next she met the Drunken Giant , trapped in sobriety , all skin and bones , who could never again sip enough ale to deliver himself into that realm of uncaring bliss . He , too , denied any knowledge of Gantica , and Adelia in turn had nothing to offer that would ease his pain , and so she left him to his misery . Adelia encountered many other giants in this realm of the Land : the Brooding Giant , the Callous Giant , the Pious Giant . All , like her , were unwilling victims of unwanted size , but none , it turned out , knew much of Gantica . The sorrows of these giants at first weighed heavily upon Adelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she determined not to let such suffering become her final fate . Adelia hired the services of a dwarf manager , for it was well known that small-statured dwarves were manipulative and greedy , and hence good at exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities such as giants . This particular dwarf manager knew from experience that when money and power is involved , social institutions are more prone to overlook the stereotypes of size than are rigid-minded individuals . So , with the dwarf perched upon her shoulder , Adelia came to the part of the Land full of City Folk . There , the sneaky mayors and sly councilmen all marveled in appreciation when she looked them in the eye as they stood on the third story of the town hall . For these people Adelia happily leveled old slums , raised new high-occupancy dwellings , and boosted municipal pride ( not to mention the mayor 's approval ratings ) . All of this she did in between carrying produce home for elderly ladies , corralling panicked ponies , and putting out kitchen fires . For a while the City Folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again grew larger . She became a legend to the City Folk , a marvel of physical achievement , and their worship filled her soul . But then a strange thing happened : Adelia found that dwarf managers take a large percentage of profits , and she herself really earned little more each night than a small ( for her ) dinner and a list from her manager of tasks to complete the following day . Even worse , she discovered that familiarity breeds apathy , for as the novelty of Adelia 's size wore off , the City Folk grew tired of donating entire wagons full of melons and squash just to feed her . When the worship subsided , the melons and squash did little to fill her stomach , and even less to fill her soul . Gradually Adelia 's duties shifted to ferrying councilmen and public officers across town , then to delivering eviction notices and collecting taxes , and tracking down criminals , from petty thieves on the lam to tenants late on the rent for their high-occupancy dwellings . After that , the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days Adelia also found it difficult to attain comfort . Sleeping on the hard ground of the central plaza every day left her tired , and the only place for her to bathe was the river , yet it was difficult to find a bit of privacy there at any hour . There was no slab of soap big enough to cleanse her , no towel big enough to dry off with , no fire big enough to warm her bones on the cold autumn nights . Amidst so many people she felt very lonely . Then one day the smoldering coals of pettiness burst into flame between Adelia 's city and its neighbor , and the respective mayors declared war for reasons minuscule or unfounded , or lost in hypocrisy . The mayor ordered Adelia to dam the River Fantis to cut off the other city 's water supply , and to hurl boulders over the outer wall , and to use the battering ram to break down the enemy 's central gates . Adelia no longer cared about the hollow praise of small-minded and small-hearted Folk , and declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explained that she was legally bound to carry out any action deemed necessary for the safety of the city , and such action now included said hostility . Adelia 's dwarf manager admitted that such a clause was in the fine print , but Adelia had never read the fine print , for the contract was the size of her thumb , and she could no longer read scrolls or books or binding contracts , and even to hear people clearly she had to bend over . ( This gave her a constant backache , of course , but there was never anyone big enough to rub it for her . ) In the end , Adelia left , for none of the City Folk , even as a collective whole , could do much about it . As she strode away , they jeered and threw melons and squash and called her names that reminded her sadly of the cruel whispers she had heard in the days before she left the Dell in the Hills . The jealousy and bigotry of Small Folk , it seemed , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Land beyond the cities to be a brutal territory in which jealousy and bigotry were mere vices . Burdened by her lingering shame , Adelia did things she later could not , or would not , remember . There were wars here , and giants in armor leading armies across smoking battle plains . There were terrible games of strength and wit and chance : giants against animals , giants against criminals , giants against giants . There was gambling and swindling and treachery from giants and men and dwarves alike . Adelia learned that the best way to find a shirt that fit a giant was to steal one from another giant . She also learned that two giants were still stronger than one , and in the end only a giant 's strength of will could match a giant 's strength of muscle . Through all of this Adelia listened for word of Gantica , but still , news was always the same : Upland . And so Upland she drifted , until gradually the games disappeared , and the battles , and the men , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelia entered lands filled only with poppy-covered meadows and pine-scented woods . And though the shame of the past did not leave , at least it subsided into memory . IT WAS NOT LONG before Adelia noticed everything around her growing larger - not individually , but as a whole . Day by day the trees around her grew taller , until she could no longer see over them , and so , too , did the meadows and hills and rivers and rocks . Soon everything around her grew to just the right size for her comfort . A single melon filled her stomach , a single brook cleansed her body , and a single tree gave her shade . Perhaps she had finally found Gantica , where the Land was large enough for giants to live in comfort . But the world did not stop growing . Soon bushes were the size of trees , rocks the size of boulders , and flowers towered far over her head . And farther Upland it took her hours just to walk around pebbles and weave her way under common blades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dandelion puff , allowing the wind to carry her where it would . When the dandelion fell apart Adelia found herself stranded in an endless forest , and she despaired at her sudden insignificance . But then her misery and bitterness faded , and she decided to embrace this new opportunity : she would abandon the deceitful ways of men and dwarves and giants for the simple life of the animals . To do that she would have to learn their language . First Adelia learned the tongue of the ladybugs , who were friendly creatures , but more importantly , patient teachers . From there she learned to speak with the wood slugs , who had nothing better to do anyway than strike up long conversations , and then the moths , and the butterflies and ants and beetles . Animals , she discovered , loved to talk . Not only that , animals were also bluntly honest : subtlety was not a strong point , and sarcasm was forever lost upon them . In this part of the Land , where even the insects were larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter , but mostly for protection : the vole would protect her from the asp in return for word of the fox 's current appetite , - the asp would protect her from the fox in return for the location of the vole 's latest burrow ; and the fox would protect her from the vole in return for a description of the asp 's current sleeping habits . Along the way Adelia came to know that voles were really cantankerous creatures at heart , foxes overly mischievous , and asps often lazy . But such qualities were not to be criticized , for that was the nature of each animal , and judgment was a concept that had yet to muddle their view of the Land . At first Adelia admired this honesty among animals , and she wondered why it was lacking in the human Folk she had met . Then gradually she came to realize that honesty was n't necessarily the same as sympathy , or compassion . And in truth , Adelia often felt a little ashamed , peddling the wants of this creature against the desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope of a tasty meal at the expense of the other . So maybe the animals were n't so different from the Folk after all , or perhaps the Folk were n't so different from the animals , just better at disguising their hunger . Either way , the animals cared little about the painful things she had seen and done in days gone by , and this helped her soul to mend . Then one day in her wanderings Adelia came to the realm of the Mushroom Folk . These were a small , humble people of her own size who took her in and made her one of their own . She did not mention her past to them , and to her relief they did not ask . Their kindness surprised Adelia , for what had she ever seen from Small Folk but jealousy and treachery and lies ? Then again , in this part of the Land , Adelia herself was a Small Folk , and small was a relative thing now anyway , and that all left her more than a little confused . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work , after all , even collectively . But the Mushroom Folk taught her how to build a home from a toadstool stalk , and grow crops of terraced truffles , and carve portobella boats to ride the brooks and streams surrounding the village . To her surprise , Adelia was very glad to have human companionship once again , not to mention a fresh start . In return for all this , Adelia helped raise latticed covers above the village and erect thick walls of bramble and thistle , all to keep out foxes , voles , and asps . Adelia often lamented the fact that in days past , when she had been much larger , she could have done in an hour what it took the village of the Mushroom Folk an entire season to do . But when that season was done and Adelia was tired as she had never been before in her life , somehow the work was also more satisfying than anything she had ever done before in her life . After that season of living in mushrooms , Adelia grew restless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she resumed her journey Upland . She borrowed the services of a silver-back hummingbird ( for silver-back hummingbirds are always wistful and restless , and only need a simple excuse to dash off on adventures ) and she traveled for many days , living at times with the Willow Folk , and then the Brittle-Corn Folk , then the Sunflower Folk . When she eventually came to the Turnip Folk , who lived in a giant garden , she paused and wondered : In whose garden did these Folk live ? The Fanner 's garden , they answered , pointing to the giant-sized farmhouse beyond the garden . Here Adelia set free the silver-back hummingbird , and though the Turnip Folk warned her to stay away from the house , she cautiously . approached it anyway . Was this a part of Gantica ? Were these giants of the farmhouse the true giants of the fabled realm ? If they were , what good **29;3404;TOOLONG again smaller than a giant 's thumb ? She had no answers , but needed to find out . The Turnip Folk were right , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farmer 's little boy ( a freckle-faced , tousled redhead who really was n't so little ) promptly caught her in a cup . After running her through the farmhouse with shouts of glee , he stuck her in a small cage of wire mesh , and there she sat for several days , occasionally fed a shred of lettuce or a moldy carrot . The Farmer 's boy often checked on her , and clapped his hands , until eventually the Farmer took the boy and Adelia in the cage to the nearest village . Together they sold her to an old man with long white hair and tiny eyes lost behind oversized spectacles . Adelia 's lasting impression of the Fanner 's boy was the huge grin that spread across his face when the Farmer dropped half the sale price of ten pennies into his eager hands . The old man who bought her had no name , at least as far as Adelia ever knew . He was just called the Maker , and what he made were clocks . In his dark , dusty shop sat hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket watches to masterful ironwood grandfather clocks . The Maker put Adelia to work cleaning and repairing the clocks , for what better way to build and maintain such tiny parts than with a tiny person ? Adelia learned to mesh pinions and set balance wheels and calibrate gear trains . After a while she became an expert at wrestling mainsprings back into alignment , and honing pendulum weights and calculating gear reductions . She thought at first it would be easy to escape the shop , especially with so many dark comers , but she had n't counted on the cat . No matter where she went within the shop , the tabby shadowed her , watching and guarding , seemingly never sleeping . They talked on occasion , when the tabby was bored , and it made a point of telling her she was lucky to work for the Maker , who was too consumed by his craft ever to bother making life difficult for her . Other Small Folk had it worse off , forced to run secret messages across town on the backs of rats , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or jealous wives of deceitful politicians , or distrustful lovers of jealous wives of deceitful politicians . This was little comfort to Adelia , who felt every bit a slave in the Maker 's shop , and eventually concluded that this village of giants certainly was not Gantica . As the days passed and she cleaned or repaired the clocks , she would sometimes detect the scent of freshly chopped pepperwood , or the musk of a man 's sweat , or the fragrance of dried rose petals . Other times Adelia heard the ringing of hammer on anvil , or the bray of a horse , or even felt the humidity of the ocean seep out from the inside of a clock escapement . And then one day she found she could hear voices from the clocks , as if she were eavesdropping , and she heard many things common and polite , and sometimes she also heard things secret and personal , like whispers of passion or promises of love . But she also heard things sinister and dark , cries of pain and whimpers of misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cleaning and maintaining the clocks then became daunting to Adelia . As she crawled inside each she felt as if she were crawling inside a person , and though some were pleasant , many were not . She learned to avoid the clocks that were broken , for out of them came the smell of decay and dirt and worms . Then one day Adelia recognized the voice in one of the clocks as a mayor of the City Folk . In another clock she recognized the voice of the Fiddle Giant , and in still another the voice of the Family Giant . In others she heard the voices of the Mountain Folk , and the Mushroom Folk , and even the Farmer and the Farmer 's little boy . After that Adelia took extra care with the clocks , for she knew they were more than just clocks , and the Maker was more than just a clocksmith . She was also tempted then - tempted as she had never been tempted before - to spend less effort with some of the clocks she did not care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gears slightly . Now that she was small she had a power like no giant ever had , for she knew what happened when the clocks stopped working . But in the end she could not bring herself to act that way . Maybe she was too afraid , or too weak . Or maybe the vision of someone else standing over her clock left a cold uncertainty in her stomach . Some time later Adelia stumbled across a small , unassuming pocket watch'in the back of the shop , and from it came the scent of fresh spun wool in dye , the click of a loom shuttle , and the sound of a woman singing . There was loneliness in that voice , and tears came to Adelia 's eyes , for she realized the same loneliness had been in that voice the day Adelia had left the Dell in the Hills . Adelia had simply not recognized it then , or chose to ignore it . Now Adelia missed her mother greatly and wanted more than anything to return home to tell her so . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave the watch extra special attention and the finest of care , Adelia knew it was running slow . One night , Adelia put the pocket watch on her back and carried it to the Maker 's workbench , and when he came in the next morning and sat down she said to him , " Sir , what can be done for this piece ? " From behind his dirty , chipped spectacles the Maker said , " I work with simple gears and springs , my dear . This timepiece requires something else for repair , something beyond my power . " Adelia lowered her head . " But not , " he added , " beyond your power . " The Maker gave a soft whistle over ancient gums and tangled beard , and in through the morning light flew the same silver-back hummingbird that had carried Adelia from the Mushroom Folk to the Sunflower Folk and beyond . It alighted on the workbench next to Adelia with a nervous flit . " Go , " the Maker said . " Go Upland , and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelia was surprised , but she did not hesitate , and so left the Maker and his shop , and rode on the back of the hummingbird out of the village , Upland once again . She had not gone far when the world around her began to shrink . The hummingbird struggled to stay aloft , as it , too , shrank , and Adelia became too heavy for it . Adelia then set it free and continued on foot , wandering for days , until finally she began to doubt the Maker 's words , or to think that she had misunderstood his meaning . The Land turned to desert , and then to marsh , and then to swamp , all the while growing smaller until one day the trees and rivers and animals and the Land itself were just the right size for her . When the swamps became rolling hills , she came to a village where all the Folk poured forth to greet her with shouts of surprise and welcome . The Iron-Weaver said , " Was your vision always cast so far Upland that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it dawned on her that these were the Dell Folk , and this was the Dell in the Hills , though how she had returned home by only venturing Upland , she could not understand . When Adelia 's mother rose from the bench behind her loom and saw Adelia walking up the pathway , she knew her daughter had grown . In Adelia 's bearing was a trace of the Land , a strength not of gears and springs , nor even of flesh and bone , but rather of spirit and will . Adelia in turn saw her mother 's eyes brighten and her breath quicken , and finally she dared believe the Maker had been right . Adelia entered her mother 's kitchen without having to duck her head , she ate dinner at her mother 's table without scraping her knees , and that night Adelia slept comfortably in the goose-down bed of her childhood . Whether in her journey the Land had changed around her , or she had changed within the Land , Adelia did not know . Adelia realized there would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wondered if she could stay in the Dell at all , for it would be difficult to follow the Maker 's advice here , where the past whispers of jealousy among the Dell Folk had not been forgotten ( by either side ) . And yet that night , after dreaming of mainsprings as large as mountains and pendulums swinging far and wide on the Upland horizon , Adelia finally decided that here , in her mother 's house , was the best place to try .
