<p> The item up for bidding was , at first blush , unremarkable . It was an unfinished manuscript , 397 pages long , less than half of the planned book , as well as an outline detailing story arcs and plot points to come . The writer ? Someone named Jordan Ainsley , whom no one had ever heard of  --  not readers , not book editors , certainly not anyone in Hollywood . Yet the biggest movie studios were being asked to pony up seven figures for the privilege of committing the book , sight half-unseen , to film . <p> And the studios promptly , and exuberantly , threw themselves into a bidding war . <p> For five days Sony Pictures , Warner Brothers , Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox battled over the film rights to Mr. Ainsley 's novel " The Passage , " the first book of a planned trilogy about vampires born not of bat bites , but of medical experiments gone awry . The winning bid , made last month by Fox 2000 and Ridley Scott 's Scott Free Productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest indicator of the lengths that studios will go to in search of their next franchise , at a time when it seems that all the biggest projects have already been done or spoken for . <p> " Fantasy has always been popular in Hollywood , " said Elizabeth Gabler , president of Fox 2000 Pictures . " And between the ' Lord of the Rings ' films and the upcoming end of the Harry Potter series , everybody 's looking for what the next version of those movies will be . " <p> Recent fantasy book-to-film projects include " Stardust , " the years-in-the-offing Paramount release based on a Neil Gaiman mini-series for DC Comics , which opened yesterday , and " The Golden Compass , " a $150 million New Line film based on the first novel in Philip Pullman 's " His Dark Materials " trilogy , which opens in December . <p> While Fox 's bid was high for an unestablished , unpublished entity , it was hardly out of line , given other recent purchases . In May Warner Brothers  --  Harry Potter 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film rights to " Skulduggery Pleasant , " a children 's book about a skeleton who is a detective . Two years ago the Walt Disney Company and Jerry Bruckheimer Films spent $1.5 million for an unpublished fantasy novel by Ahmet Zappa . <p> All of this makes you downright nostalgic for 1998 , when J. K. Rowling sold the film rights to both of the then-existing Potter books  --  the movies have since grossed more than $3.5 billion internationally  --  for a sum in the low seven figures . <p> Of course , banking on a fantasy franchise is not without its risks ; the roster of bombs is enough to chill even the bravest of producer 's hearts . For every " Lord of the Rings " there 's a " Treasure Planet "  --  an animated Disney film that cost an estimated $140 million and sold less than $40 million of tickets domestically  --  with the potential losses magnified by often hyper-inflated budgets for special effects . <p> " The Adventures of Baron Munchausen , " Terry Gilliam 's 1988 comedy-adventure movie about a world-traveling aristocrat , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within , " based on the video game about an alien invasion , made back less than a quarter of its $137 million budget in the United States , and $85 million over all . <p> The frenzy for the " Passage " film rights was unleashed even before the first pitch went out to the studios . Two weeks before the studio deal , Ellen Levine , a literary agent at Trident Media Group , had taken the manuscript to the country 's biggest publishing houses , including Random House and the Penguin Group . Ms. Levine chose to send out the book under the pseudonym Jordan Ainsley because the author , Justin Cronin , winner of the PEN/Hemingway Award for his 2001 short-story collection , " Mary and O'Neil , " was known more for midsize family dramas than for Stephen King-size thrillers . <p> " We were n't trying to hide who he was , but I did n't want him to be typecast as one kind of author , and I thought this had vast commercial potential , " Ms. Levine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row inmates transformed into vampires by a government-spawned virus , hit a nerve with publishers . A number tried to block their competitors with pre-emptive offers , some in the millions . The offers were summarily rejected , and the manuscript was put on the block at a " best bids " auction between four houses on July 3 . <p> The winner for the United States rights to the trilogy was Ballantine Books , which New York magazine reported had paid $3.75 million , a figure that Mark Tavani , the book 's editor , said was " not correct , but in the ballpark . " <p> When the author 's identity was revealed to Libby McGuire , Ballantine 's publisher , she said that the company would publish the book under Mr. Cronin 's name . The first novel in the trilogy is to be released in the summer of 2009 , with the others to be published in 2011 and 2013 . <p> By the time Ms. Levine began shopping the manuscript to the studios two weeks later , much of Hollywood had already seen it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all similarly talked-about books , had gotten copies of Mr. Cronin 's work into the hands of producers at most of the major studios . <p> The auction for film rights was a shock for Mr. Cronin . " I 've written several novels , never once thinking they could or should be movies , " he wrote in an e-mail message . " Which does n't mean it is n't nice , now that it 's happened . " <p> As the studios and their partners ( Ron Howard and Brian Grazer 's Imagine Entertainment , with Universal ; Scott Rudin and Sam Raimi with Sony ; and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman with Warner Brothers ) found out about the competition for the material , prices climbed . <p> Unlike the three-book deal signed by Ballantine , the fee paid by Fox is only for the first book of the planned trilogy . " There were reports that there was a certain amount of money , and that was for three books , but that is not true , " said Ms. Levine , who is currently shopping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already sealed deals in seven other countries . ) <p> Yet paying nearly $2 million for an unfinished book that nobody will see for another couple of years is not all that odd , at least not in Hollywood . For the studios , big payouts for properties based on outlines and concepts rather than on finished books or fully formed screenplays is not uncommon ; many of the superhero movies of late have been sold on little more than a few comic books and the broadest of plot ideas . <p> And if the movie bombs ? <p> " I 'm sure in some year-end meetings , someone has to account for them , and someone loses a job , " said Amy Schiffman , vice president of books and literary properties at the Gersh Agency . " But every year the studios keep clamoring for more , now more than ever . There are a lot of Harry Potter wannabes in development , trying to get to be movies . The conventional wisdom of the studios now is , you risk more , you make more . " ##
