<p> Telescopes and field glasses always at hand , John P. Kelly never seems to tire of observing the habits and dramatic exploits of water birds and shorebirds on Tomales Bay . <p> Sometimes he waits and watches from tall grass on the marshy shore . He wanders on foot near the delta of Lagunitas Creek . He trolls around the 12-mile-long estuary on a 17-foot Boston Whaler . <p> He imagines another time : a thousand years ago when the Coastal Miwok , the area 's first settlers , roamed the shoreline - picking berries and gathering shellfish . Despite years of observation , he still swoons over the stirring displays of courting great blue herons and great egrets . <p> But like any other modern-day scientist , the lion 's share of Kelly 's time is spent behind a computer , where he analyzes data from his and other birders ' observations , formulates hypotheses and deliberates over his findings . <p> " If I 'm doing really well , I get out in the field a day a week , " said Kelly , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Marin hamlet of Marshall . " The challenge is that a heck of a lot is required beyond the field observations . " <p> Kelly , 52 , has spent the last 14 years studying the birds of Tomales Bay and the greater Bay Area . And he has investigated ways to restore coastal marshes on the Pacific flyway . Tens of thousands of migratory birds winter at Tomales Bay , Bolinas Lagoon and other North Coast sanctuaries . <p> Cypress Grove Preserve , a wing of the Bolinas-based Audubon Canyon Ranch , is a largely unknown research station and wildlife refuge - visited only by a few scientists and rarely open to the public . It previously served as a hunting lodge , Coast Guard housing and a private estate . <p> " The perennial challenge is to try to make things relevant , " said Kelly , the director of research and resource management at Cypress Grove . " We do some things that are addressing more academic issues in ecology , fundamental principles and testing hypotheses . Other things we do directly address conservation issues . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major studies of the ecology of herons and egrets as well as the populations , habitat relationships , and behavioral ecology of numerous other birds . They have also focused on wetland ecology and on efforts to restore native plants that are threatened by invasive species . <p> Some days , Kelly spends hours on the water - patiently observing , jotting notes and taking photographs . He observes from great distances , so as not to disturb the birds . At times his written meditations and musings are reminiscent of Sierra explorer John Muir 's evocative prose . <p> " I love to lie close to the ground and peer through the grasses , " Kelly wrote . " Miniature scales of process , climate , and design are magnified . Life comes closer . . . <p> " I am under the spell of nature : fine tunings , timing , arrangement , repetition . I recognize the organizing force of such wonder . Transformations . . . Egrets sail into the cypress trees each evening as sun dims . But the silence of herons conceal further mystery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and 14-year-old son in a single-story ranch house on the edge of the 10-acre compound . His nearby offices have a different look . <p> The historic waterfront property is comprised of Victorian white cottages , gardens and an adjoining 150-acre marshland preserve . Most of its buildings were constructed in the 1870s , shortly after narrow-gauge tracks for the North Pacific Coast Railroad were laid along the edge of Tomales Bay . For decades , a Petaluma family owned the compound , and then it was taken over by the Coast Guard during World War II . <p> San Francisco architect Clifford Conly Jr. , who had visited Cypress Grove as a child , bought the dilapidated property in 1952 . He restored the cottages , added a greenhouse and gardens , and moved into the estate . <p> In 1970 , when developers threatened to build suburbs on the shores of Tomales Bay , Dr. Martin Griffin - a prominent Marin conservationist who helped create Audubon Canyon Ranch - called Conly one evening and asked whether he would consider selling the property to the nonprofit so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , Conly responded that he would give away the acreage for free if Griffin would hang up and let him have some sleep . <p> Since then , Cypress Grove has served as a springboard for various research projects . Novice and veteran birders have participated in Kelly 's long-running project to study all the known heron and egret breeding colonies in the Bay Area . Now in its 14th year , his project is focusing on regional patterns of disturbance and spatial relationships among colony sites . <p> Eighty volunteers collect data from March to June from the Bay Area 's 60 active colonies where great blue herons , great egrets , snowy egrets , black-crowned night herons , and double-crested cormorants are found . <p> Kelly has studied all the usual and unusual suspects , from the common yellowthroat and the western sandpiper to the peregrine falcon . <p> He also has done limited studies on fish species of Tomales Bay and its watershed as well as salt marsh bird's-beak ( Cordylanthus maritimus ) , a flowering plant that is on the U.S. government 's list of endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a bachelor 's degree at Humboldt State University and earned his Ph.D . in ecology at UC Davis . He joined the Audubon Canyon Ranch in 1989 , and began working at Cypress Grove . He was a previously a staff biologist at the Point Reyes Bird Observatory . <p> His work expanded upon the research of Helen Pratt , a self-taught scientist who in the late 1960s had begun the nonprofit 's early research projects . For 35 years , Pratt studied the heron rookery at Picher Canyon , a redwood grove next to Bolinas Lagoon , and wrote scientific papers on her observations . <p> " John made it clear that it was important to not only focus on one colony but have a more regional perspective , " said Katie Etienne , research coordinator for Cypress Grove . " You do n't want to make judgments based on just one colony . . . <p> " There 's a real focus here on primary ecological questions that are relevant to other systems , " Etienne said . " We 're at a point where we can focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broader ecological landscape - to help provide scientific insight that can be applied to conservation and conservation biology . " <p> Cypress Grove 's full-time staff includes Kelly , Etienne , and land steward David Green . This year , an intern is working on a heron and egret study at Cypress Grove . <p> Many of Cypress Grove 's projects involve scientists at Audubon Canyon Ranch , including its Bolinas Preserve as well as its Bouverie Preserve near Glen Ellen in Sonoma County . Kelly , his associates and hundreds of volunteers have conducted numerous , long-term inventories of bird populations on Tomales Bay - gathering eight times a year at rising tide to count shorebird flocks . <p> Kelly is drawn to broad , scientific questions of how and why plants and animals survive . For example , he has studied the effect of winter storms , availability of food , and predation on the energy conservation habits of wintering Dunlin . <p> " The question was how do shorebirds regulate how much energy they store in relation to how much food is available and what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the question I 'm looking at is how they make those decisions . And also , what causes these birds to leave an estuary in an El Nio . " <p> Kelly and his colleagues have also investigated various issues of ecosystem management , contributing to the scientific knowledge used by wildlife managers to benefit these populations . <p> " When ( Audubon Canyon Ranch ) started 45 years ago , the primary mission was to protect sanctuaries , " Kelly said . " As time went along , we realized that you can not protect natural systems by putting a fence around small sanctuaries , because the plants and animals that live on a sanctuary depend on ecological processes that occur over much larger scales . So when we look at the natural resources on our property , we 're looking at how these plants and animals depend on processes over the whole region . . . <p> " By jumping into some of these areas on a basic ( science ) level , " he said , " it gives us the insight and credibility to make recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has studied ways to control growing populations of ravens - an aggressive predator that threatens the snowy plover and other wildlife . <p> And he has examined human influences on nature . In the mid-1990s , Kelly joined two other researchers to study the effects of local oyster farms on habitat use by wintering shorebirds . <p> For several years , Kelly and other local researchers and representatives from local government agencies and wildlife management groups served on the Tomales Bay advisory committee . A few years ago , the advisory panel morphed into the Watershed Council , which is creating a stewardship plan for the watershed . <p> " John is on our science committee as a technical adviser , and he has been an important part of the development of the council 's stewardship plan for Tomales Bay , " said Neysa King , the watershed council 's executive director . " John is known as a real sound thinker . He 's not a talker , he 's much more of a doer . He 's really concerned with this place . His participation in the council is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and beyond . <p> " And he keeps us laughing . He wears Hawaiian shirts in the middle of winter in West Marin . " <p> Kelly has also joined restoration ecology 's fight against invasive species , including the notorious Spartina ( cordgrass ) , which has been recently found in Tomales Bay . Spartina is a highly aggressive invader capable of altering the biological composition of tidal marshes and mudflats . <p> Kelly wants to build a state-of-the-art laboratory at Cypress Grove and a dormitory facility for field observation crews of six or eight people . He hopes to soon hire an administrative manager , and perhaps in the next few years , a wetlands ecologist and landscape ecologist . <p> His personal goal is to carve out more time to study the Bay Area 's heron and egret colonies . " These birds move very frequently among colonies , and that movement is not understood well at all , " he said . " I 'm looking at disturbance - by humans and natural predators - as driving that movement among colonies . " <p> This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused extensive roof damage . There were power failures , big rains and road closures . <p> " There are tons of trade-offs , but they are all worth it , " Kelly said . " In the winter time out here it 's still one of the best-kept secrets . Tomales Bay is empty . At night , the only boats you see are the oystermen going to work . " <p> As always , Kelly sees a living landscape : He marvels at a departing cloud of shorebirds flushed from their high-tide roost . " I love it here , " he said . " It 's a quiet and beautiful place to work . " <p> E-mail Jim Doyle at jdoyle@sfchronicle.com.
