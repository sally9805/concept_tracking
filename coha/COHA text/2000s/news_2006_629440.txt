<p> The city of Houston 's Neighborhood Protection Department has ordered the Candlelight Trails condominium association to repair a variety of maintenance issues at the complex on De Soto Lane . <p> The responsibility for fixing the problems at the complex lies with the Candlelight Trails I Association , the condominium association that governs the eight-building complex at 5555 , 5625 , 5635 , 5655 and 5675 De Soto , off Antoine between West Tidwell and West Little York roads in northwest Houston . <p> The 240 units in the complex are individually owned , but the condominium association is responsible for using association dues paid by condominium owners to make repairs and maintain all of the property 's commonly owned areas , such as roofs , halls , parking lots and gates . <p> Candlelight Trails board members said they have formulated a 30-day plan and will get to work immediately on making the complex a safer and more comfortable place for tenants and owners . <p> Roof problems <p> Robert Greene , who owns a unit at the complex , has asked management to repair a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time it rains , water pours into my house - it is getting ridiculous , " Greene said .

" <p> Greene said the ceiling in the one of three bedrooms in the unit appeared intact when he moved into the condominium last July . The roof leak that created the hole was minor at first , he said , but worsened with time and has since eaten away at the ceiling . <p> Greene said he has taken his case to board members to no avail in the past . <p> Problem areas <p> A tour of the complex reveals that Greene 's ceiling is not the only thing that needs to be repaired in Candlelight Trails ' eight buildings and common areas .

" People who do rent from me say they fear for their lives and do n't want to stay . I can barely get enough rent to cover my association fees . I will probably lose them ( to foreclosure ) soon . " <p> Things began looking up in 2004 when some key investor groups came in and saw the potential to turn the place around and began buying up units , said Greg Wood , a California attorney who owns 11 units . While several repairs have been made in the past year-and-a-half , a year-long deadlock between the two board members has prevented many projects from moving forward . <p> Stalemate <p> Those two board members Shirley Gonzales and David Lattin blame each other for inactivity at the complex . The newest board member , Lance Edwards , agrees with Lattin 's position , but said the association is finally on its way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third vote to break the often 1-to-1 tie . <p> Gonzales said she wants to see the complex , and individual property owners , benefit from repairs made to the common areas . She said she has not intentionally blocked the association from moving forward with improvements to the property , but has insisted that all board actions follow rules and procedures outlined in the Candlelight Trails Association 's condominium declaration and by-laws . <p> For example , Gonzales said , when the board agreed to fix the roofs on some of the buildings , the management company - Randall Management Co. - was asked to get at least three bids for identical work from three different contractors . She said she has never seen three bids on any project , and the bids she does see do not have details about work to be performed . Therefore , she votes against awarding the bid . <p> The work that has been done at the complex often authorized without her knowledge is not up to par , Gonzales said . <p> " They ( management company ) are using Band-Aids to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired contractors ) to paint walls without preparation work and get paint on the trim and the carpet . They paint the walls , but not the doors . They do n't fix leaks in buildings , but put in new carpet , which is going to be ruined eventually . We pay off-duty police officers to patrol the property , but they just sit in the office . <p> " They ( management company and other board members ) are trying to make me the scapegoat , but they are the ones selectively enforcing the rules . If anyone is responsible for things not moving forward , it is them . " <p> Lattin and Edwards say the opposite is true . <p> Lattin said he accepted a board position over a year ago with the full intention of taking steps to improve the property . He owns five units at Candlelight Trails . <p> He said the board replaced the existing management company with Randall Management Co. and started working on a list of " to-do " items meant to increase property values . <p> " Then a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , " Lattin said . <p> Gonzales said she did initiate legal action last year against the board for not following proper procedures , but withdrew the lawsuit when it proved too expensive to pursue . <p> Edwards , who was appointed president of the board in early January , said things took a leap forward last week with the new board 's first monthly meeting . He said he presented a 90-day plan for the complex that focuses on improving security , making capital improvements and repairs to all eight buildings , and improving the property 's " curb appeal " so that owners can attract tenants and begin paying association dues to fund future improvement projects . Only about half of the 240 units are occupied . <p> First steps <p> Edwards said the board voted to accept a $50,000 loan from a California-based property owner Almeck Candlelight Inc. , which owns 40 units , to get the first phase of repairs funded and , hopefully completed , in the next 30 days . He said locks will be placed on all building doors , the front gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building will be fixed , and a billboard will be placed out front to attract attention to improvements at the property . <p> He said the association 's board is also sending a letter to all property owners who are behind in paying association dues that offer to put them on a " catch-up " plan . If those owners pay their March dues in full and agree to go on a payment plan for the delinquent dues , they board agrees to cut their late fee charges in half . <p> " We hope the combination of the two plans will encourage some people to start paying their back dues , " Edwards said . <p> Randall Smith , owner of Randall Management Co. , who was hired to manage the property in September 2004 , said the property does have its share of problems , but has come a long way despite the board 's deadlock in the past year . <p> " There were only 40 units occupied when we came in , " Smith said .

UVVENA JOHNSON , JUST 19 YEARS OLD , WAS FOUND DEAD ON HER MILITARY BASE IN BALAD , IRAQ , IN JULY 2005 . At first the Army initiated a homicide investigation , then suddenly , without explanation , closed it and ruled her death a suicide by an M-16 rifle . Yet her parents said she had been calling home every day-she worked in communications and so had access to a phone-always sounding happy and healthy . When her father , John Johnson , a veteran of the Army himself , viewed his daughter 's body at the funeral home , he noticed several suspicious factors . Her face was bruised , the gunshot wound did not match the description in the autopsy and white uniform gloves had been glued onto her hands . He pressed for more investigation , later gaining access to photographs that showed abrasions to her face , a broken nose , bums on those hands , signs of sexual abuse and more bums to her back and genital area . He also learned that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set on fire inside a tent None of this made suicide likely or even possible . Johnson and his wife believe that their daughter was raped , murdered and burned to cover the evidence . The Johnsons have been pressing the Army to reopen the investigation ever since , but so far have been stonewalled at every turn . John Johnson was as frustrated as ever when he ventured from his home in Florissant , Mo. , to Washington , D.C. , in July to meet Army officials . " Nothing has changed , " Johnson told me over the phone in early September . " They 're still stonewalling . When I talked to the Army about my daughter 's case , it was a fiasco . " This past July 31 , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on sexual assault in the military that provided further evidence of the Department of Defense 's decades-old reluctance to truly address the problem : Despite having been subpoenaed by Congress to testify , Dr. Kaye Whitley , the military 's top civilian expert on sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses . Only after the committee sent an angry letter to secretary of Defense Robert Gates demanding that Whitley honor her subpoena did she appear at a second hearing on Sept. 10 , this one held by the Subcommittee on National security and Foreign Affairs . At the hearing , Whitley , who is director of the DOD 's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office ( SAPRO ) , which was created in 2005 following a public outcry over assaults at the Air Force and Army academies , explained her office 's work and trumpeted its success . " After three full years of policy implementation , we are seeing more victims making reports and accessing care . While we are extremely concerned when even one sexual assault occurs , we see the increase in victim reports as a very positive indicator of growing confidence in the program . " The creation of this office may be a sign of progress , but as every statistician knows , nobody can tell whether an increase in reported rapes means that more women are reporting the crime or that more women are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there might be room for improvement was in her conclusion : " We have accomplished remarkable progress in a short time frame but we know our work to eradicate sexual assault is not complete . In the future , we will no doubt meet additional challenges . " The reality is that the military 's top brass has a dismal record when it comes to stopping the persecution and abuse of its female members . Here are a few examples : Of the sexual assaults reported and recorded by the DOD in fiscal year 2007 , half were met with no official action , a third were dismissed as unworthy of investigation and only 8 percent of those investigated were referred to courtsmartial . In comparison , 40 percent of those arrested for sex crimes in received punishments so mild they amounted to slaps on the wrist , conveying the message that men can do what they want to women in the military with little consequence . For some time after the Defense Department created SAPRO , its website ( www.sapr.mil ) displayed on its main page a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begins with YOU . " Most telling of all , despite three years of legal and procedural reforms , the creation of SAPRO and the initiation of " restricted " ( anonymous ) reporting of incidents , there is no evidence that sexual assaults in the military are decreasing at all . From 2005 to 2006 , reports of sexual assaults jumped 40 percent , and the following year they jumped another 24 percent . ( In 2007 , the number declined 9 percent , but the method of accounting changed from calendar years to fiscal years , so the numbers can not be compared . ) In 2007 , the Department of Veterans Affairs reported that 20 percent of female veterans seen at its facilities nationwide said they had been raped or sexually assaulted while serving . Other veteran studies put the incidence of rape at 30 percent : nearly one-third of all women in the military force . Furthermore , the DOD admits on its website that 80 percent of rapes in the military are not reported because women ( and the men who are raped , too ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in civilian life the FBI puts the rate of unreported rape at 60 percent . The rate of sexual assault and rape in the military is at least twice as high as it is among civilians . As Rep. Jane Harman ( D-Calif. ) put it in her testimony at the July hearing , " Women serving in the U.S. military are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in Iraq . " In fact , the atmosphere in the military makes it a fertile ground for sexual assault and rape . Women are routinely degraded from boot camp on with obscene insults , relentless staring , sexist rhymes , pornography and sexual harassment . When a military woman dares to report an assault , she is seen as a traitor to her fellow soldiers-a liar , a weakling or a " bitch " out to destroy a man 's career . There are exceptions to this rule-units in which the command sets a tone of respect toward women . But , as Sgt. Sarah Scully of the Army 's 8th Military Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that you are a woman means you are automatically ridiculed or treated as inferior . " I have heard the same opinion from women in all branches of the military . The failure of the Department of Defense to change this picture is indicative of the misogyny that saturates military culture at large . I have been writing about rape for over 20 years , during which time I have interviewed hundreds of survivors , but when I started talking to female soldiers for my forthcoming book on women in the Iraq war , I felt catapulted into a time warp . Servicewomen face the most retrograde attitudes imaginable , while at the same time finding themselves trapped in a rigid hierarchy that paralyzes their ability to seek justice and punishes them if they try . " Rape is the only crime where the victim must prove her innocence , " as Ingrid S. Torres , a Red Cross nurse who was raped by an Air Force doctor while she was on duty in Korea , said in her testimony at the July hearing . This is not to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D-N.Y. ) and others demanded reforms in the military in 2005 , rape evidence kits , anonymous reporting , victim advocates and training aimed at preventing assault have been brought into the military , as Whitley so eagerly pointed out . But these measures are so irregularly implemented that they have failed to change the dismal picture for women in any significant way . Instead , a punitive and hostile atmosphere still rules when it comes to dealing with women who report sexual assault . Here are some other stories I have gathered from my research and interviews : When Air Force Sgt. Marti Ribeiro reported having been raped in 2007 by a fellow soldier while on guard duty in Afghanistan , her superiors told her that she would be charged with dereliction of duty for having left her weapon unattended just before she was attacked . In 2006 , when Army Spc . Suzanne Swift went AWOL to avoid redeploying under the sergeant who had been raping her for months , she was arrested , court-martialed for desertion , demoted and jailed for a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raped by a drill sergeant at boot camp and tried to report it to a supervisor , he made her drop to the floor and do so many push-ups before she could talk that she lost the will and ability to report her attack . She did n't tell anyone about the crime until 10 years and a suicide attempt later . In 2006 , when Cassandra Hernandez of the Air Force reported being gang-raped by three comrades , she was charged with indecent behavior . That same year , Army Spc . Chamelle Henneberry had a promotion delayed after reporting a sergeant for sexually assaulting her in Iraq . Meanwhile , he was promoted almost immediately . The Defense Department claims that since 2005 , its updated rape reporting options have created a " climate of confidentiality " that allows women to report without fear of being disbelieved , blamed or punished like this . Yet all these cases happened after the reforms of 2005 were put into effect . " It 's taken me more than a year to realize that it was n't my fault , " Sgt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making females believe they brought this upon themselves . That 's wrong . " It gets worse , as the case of LaVena Johnson points out . And then there 's the horrifying story of Lance CpI . Maria Lauterbach . In 2007 , Lauterbach called her mother , Mary , from her Marine base to tell her she had been raped by a fellow Marine , CpI . Cesar Laurean . Lauterbach did not want to report the rape for fear of being disbelieved and ostracized , but her mother persuaded her that it was her duty . So Lauterbach reluctantly reported it , and soon became what her mother calls " the subject of many acts of harassment and intimidation . " Among other incidents , a fellow Marine punched her in the face . The Marines did nothing about it . That December , Lauterbach , who was then eight months pregnant , disappeared . Later , she was found murdered , burnt and buried in the backyard of Laurean , the accused rapist . He went on the lam , but was caught and accused of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Lauterbach sadly concluded , " Maria regretted reporting the rape and , more than anything , I regret urging her to report the rape . If she had not reported the rape , both Maria and my first grandchild would be with us today . " In other testimony about this case given at the hearing , Lt. Col. Curtis Hill , public affairs officer for the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force , made a revealing admission : " CpI . Laurean denied having any sexual contact with Lance CpI . Lauterbach , and this was believed to be significant evidence . " In other words , while her testimony was not believed , his mere denial was . The cases of Lauterbach and Johnson are but two examples of women soldiers who died in unexplained circumstances that were labeled by the military as either suicides or accidents . As of this writing , 102 U.S. female service members have died in Iraq alone , 42 of whom died in what the military calls " noncombat-related incidents . " Four of those women had been raped earlier in their deployments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such suspicious circumstances that retired Army Col. Ann Wright and Rep. Ike Skelton ( D-Mo. ) have called for Congress to compel the military to reopen the cases and investigate . " I 'm going to keep fighting , " says John Johnson of his daughter LaVena 's case . " I figure the person who did this to my daughter has rank and prestige and the Army wants to cover this up to spare themselves the embarrassment . And now so many people have compromised their careers by participating in this cover-up . " In reaction to these and other disturbing stories , Reps . Harman and Michael Turner ( R-Ohio ) have introduced legislation urging the secretary of defense to encourage and increase investigations and prosecutions of sex crimes in the military . Rep. Slaughter also reintroduced her previously defeated bill , the Military Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Act , which would create counseling and treatment programs throughout the Veterans Affairs Administration , among other things . The DOD has also finally mobilized its 11-person Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to a congressional directive back in 2005 . It has begun a program of visiting some 20 or so military installations around the world to assess how well they handle the prevention of and response to sexual assault . The visits will continue until June 2009 , after which the Task Force will issue a report to Congress . The Army , also , has stepped up its efforts . On Sept. 8 , it held a weeklong training summit in Alexandra , Va . for 250 civilians and military folks to figure out how to better prevent and prosecute rape . These are worthwhile efforts , but all the well-meaning reforms , meetings and rules issued in Washington , D.C. , will never have much effect as long as military culture remains unchanged . One can also argue that women are still in such relatively small numbers in the armed servicesthey make up one in 10 soldiers in Iraq , and one in seven in the military at large-that they ca n't yet command the respect and protection they deserve . But a change could begin with officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban pornography , treat their female soldiers with respect and insist that others do likewise significantly reduce sexual persecution . So far , such commanders are few and far between . And , so far , the behavior of the Department of Defense and the Pentagon has only demonstrated , as many a soldier has said to me , that the military is more concerned with protecting their men from scandal than their women from rape .
