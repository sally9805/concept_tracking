A few of us have the talent or luck to become rock stars , billionaires or Presidents . The rest of us can only hope to be the cousin of the rock star , the best friend of the billionaire , the embarrassing sibling of the President . <P> Hanger-on-dom , that more attainable yet rarely celebrated dream , is the subject of HBO 's summer sitcom Entourage ( Sundays , 10 p.m . E.T. ) . Vince Chase ( Adrian Grenier ) is a hot young actor who has just opened a blockbuster thriller . But the title refers to the homeboys from Queens  --  including his unofficial manager Eric ( Kevin Connolly ) and chucklehead pal Turtle ( Jerry Ferrara )  --  who live in his L.A. house , ride in his Rolls , smoke his pot and score his surplus women . ( " Come on , make out with me , " Turtle cajoles one . " I 'll show you where Vince eats breakfast . " ) In return , they make him feel safe . <P> Safe from what ? From **25;10361;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a rising star , now a washed-up actor chafing in Vince 's shadow . ( He 's played by Kevin Dillon , the brother of Matt Dillon and evidently the best sport in Hollywood . ) Dillon gives depth and poignancy to a one-joke character . Admittedly , it 's often a great joke , as when Drama brags about having been on " Blue "  --  it turns out he means not NYPD but Pacific Blue , the mid- ' 90s show about buff bicycle cops . Grenier , likewise , gives Vince a sweet , dim Vinnie Barbarino appeal . Vince does n't read scripts  --  even for the movie he just made  --  but he seems savvy enough to know the utility of his dumbness . <P> A blinged-out tour of the lifestyle of the rich and ( for now ) famous , Entourage is a funny but familiar diversion , lacking the darkness and edge that have distinguished HBO 's best series . Unlike The Larry Sanders Show , it does n't want to break new ground in critiquing show biz . It just wants you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it 'll show you where Vince eats breakfast .
