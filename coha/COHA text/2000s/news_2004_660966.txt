<p> It 's a stark sight : A pile of missile-flattened vehicles hugs the wall of a half-destroyed building , while gun-toting guards mill at the door of another shellshocked structure . They part to allow visitors to climb narrow stairs , past tiny rooms with single beds , into one completely filled with boardroom-style table and chairs . <p> Short and slightly stooped , the familiar figure in military dress uniform and kaffiyeh enters with a smile and handshakes all around . Now in his 70s , Palestinian Authority ( PA ) President Yasser Arafat has the spent look of a man confined for two years inside this grim compound . As the leader sits down , Palestinians await the results of a meeting between President Bush and the man who confines Mr. Arafat , Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon . <p> The next day 's news will be very bad for the Palestinians . They call Mr. Bush 's letter to Mr. Sharon - in which the US acknowledges some Israeli settlements in the West Bank and rejection of the right of return - a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British first promised Jewish Zionists a homeland in Palestine , as long as it did not prejudice the rights of the " non-Jewish community . " <p> In two meetings - one before the announcement , at which the Monitor asked questions , and a speech two days after to Christians from 30 countries - Mr. Arafat hews to one line . " In spite of what we are facing in this catastrophe , which our people are suffering day by night from this Israeli military escalation , " he says , " we are still committed to the ' peace of the brave ' which we signed with our partner , Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who was killed by fanatical groups . " <p> In a tumultuous 40-year odyssey , Arafat has gone from armed revolutionary steeped in a violent struggle against Israel ; to found Fatah , a militantly nationalist Palestinian organization , in the early 1960s ; to peacemaker and 1994 Nobel Prizewinner ; to the first elected Palestinian president ; and now , to semisidelined leader . <p> A decade ago , Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reform and lead his people to statehood . Now they consider him a failure in that , and blame him for igniting and fueling the intifada that broke out in 2000 . Israel insists he is directly involved in terrorist actions , unable or unwilling to stem violence that has killed more than 900 Israelis and more than 2,000 Palestinians over the past four years . <p> An October 2003 poll by Palestinian researchers found that a majority of Palestinians said that they do " not feel the presence of the PA after three years of Israeli reoccupation of most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . " When asked to evaluate the performance of the PA , 61.4 percent said it was bad to very bad . <p> Indeed , since the second intifada , the suicide bomber , considered a martyr in Palestinian society , has challenged Arafat as the ultimate representation of the Palestinian people . Yet Arafat 's figure still looms large as a symbol of the decades-long Palestinian resistance - and , to some , of the desires for peace , in his acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Today , he wears a lapel pin with two crossed flags , of Palestine and Israel , a symbol of the two-state solution . He still mourns the assassination of Rabin by a Jewish fundamentalist . With Rabin , he says , there were discussions of an economic zone to include Israel , Palestine , Jordan , and Lebanon . " They killed my partner , " he repeats . <p> Last week 's news from Washington was a further blow to the Palestinian leadership . Sharon 's position has been to seek approval for a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip - something Palestinians have sought - while gaining flexibility in dealing with settlements on the West Bank . " I do n't have to be diplomatic , " says Hanan Ashwari , head of Al-Miftah , a human rights group , who accompanies Arafat at the meeting . " For the first time , an American president has given his blessings for land theft , violation of international law , illegal settlements , and negation of refugee rights ... If the US wants to maintain even minimal credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validate our rights . " <p> Despite the shock , the isolated Arafat seems so invigorated by the large crowd of foreigners that he talks forcefully for 20 minutes and afterwards greets each one at the door . <p> Palestinians call the 36-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza the last remaining colonization in the world , and wonder why the international community does not come to their aid . They say they have negotiated in good faith . <p> " We have accepted all the agreements , from Camp David to Oslo , to Wye River , to Taba , to the road map , " Arafat emphasizes . " It was the Israelis that came up with a list of reservations to President Bush 's road map . And we have been willing to have American and European forces at the borders . " <p> Yet it 's the one he could n't accept that has dogged the Palestinian leader , the Barak proposal many in Israel and the US called the most generous offer ever made to Palestinians , while the latter saw it as a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a viable state . <p> Since the outbreak of the intifada , Arafat has been treated as a pariah . The result has been military strikes against PA facilities - from headquarters to police stations and educational ministries ; his confinement ; and renewed assassination threats . Israel has said it had specific information , which it then presented to Washington , that Arafat was directing funds , weapons , and orders for attacks on Israelis . <p> " He is the only elected president in the Middle East and yet he is treated like this , " says Saeb Erekat , the longtime Palestinian negotiator . <p> Arafat was elected Palestinian president in January 1996 . For a while hopes were high , hotel and other construction soared , and expectations rose for tourism and other opportunities . <p> A month later , however , four suicide bombings by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on Israeli buses killed about 60 people . Those challenged Israelis ' confidence in their peacemaking leadership and raised questions as to whether Arafat was capable of reining in his own militants . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected , and the process declined further . <p> Palestinian leaders say opinion polls show that a growing radicalization of the population - including support for suicide bombings - derives from the lack of a peace process , Israeli collective punishments affecting more families , continuing extrajudicial killings , and fundamentalists gaining support for their social agenda while the secular PA 's capacity diminishes . Now they confront what they call the apartheid wall , the antiterrorism barrier that also carves off Palestinian lands and water resources . <p> From a pile of papers and mementos in front of him , Arafat picks up a framed print . It depicts the three kings heading to Bethlehem , stopped cold at the wall . <p> " Who can accept this ? " he asks , questioning the world 's lack of concern . " Who can accept that on Good Friday , Christians could n't go to Jerusalem for Easter celebrations , or that the historic road between Bethlehem and Jerusalem has been cut off by the wall ? " <p> Yet faced with a new US position contrary to long-accepted UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep on , looking to the UN Security Council , the quartet of nations involved in the process , even to Israeli peace camps and Americans who support the two-state solution . <p> " The platform for the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference and the 2002 Beirut initiative from all the Arab countries - the first time they had accepted peace with Israel - must be respected , " he insists . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
