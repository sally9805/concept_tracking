HE KNEW IT WAS WRONG , AND THAT HE WAS going to get caught . He said he knew this day was coming . He knew they had been stupid , he told meworse , greedy . He said he knew he should have stopped . But somehow , each time he thought they 'd quit , he 'd ask himself how once more could make it any worse . Now he knew he was in trouble . I recognized the tune . Over twenty-some years , the folks sitting in that leather club chair in front of my desk have found only a few old standards in the jukebox . I Did n't Do It . The Other One Did It . Why Are They Picking on Me . His selection , I 'm Sorry , made the easiest listening . But they all wanted to hear the same song from me : Maybe I Can Get You Out of This . I said it usually , although I knew it would often prove untrue . But it 's a complicated business being somebody 's only hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys like to hear and tell . About a case . About a client . His name was Robert Feaver . Everyone knew him as Robbie , although he was getting old for that kind of thing , forty-three , he 'd said , when I asked his age . The time was 1992 , the second week in September . The pundits had finally stopped predicting that Ross Perot was going to be the next President of the United States , and the terms " dot " and " com " had not yet been introduced to one another . I recall the period precisely because the week before I had returned to Virginia to lay my father to rest . His passing , which over the years I 'd assumed I would take as being in the natural order of things , had instead imbued all my waking moments with the remotequality of dreams , so that even my hand , when I considered it , seemed disconnected from my body . Robbie Feaver 's troubles were more immediate . Last night , three Special Agents of the Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeone to talk and two to listen . They were , as you would expect , rumpled men in inexpensive sport coats , grave but polite . They had handed him a grand jury subpoena for all of his law partnership 's financial records and tried to ask Robbie questions about his income tax returns . Wisely , he had refused to reply . He could suit himself , responded the one agent who spoke . But they wanted to tell him a couple things . Good news and bad . Bad first . They knew . They knew what Robbie and his law partner , Morton Dinnerstein , had been up to . They knew that for several years the two had occasionally deposited a check they received when they won or settled one of their personal injury cases in a secret account at River National Bank , where the firm transacted no other business . They knew that out of the River National account Dinnerstein and Robbie had paid the usual shares of what they 'd earnedtwo thirds to the clients , one ninth to the referring attorneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received his due . Except the IRS . They knew that for years now , Feaver and his partner had been writing checks to cash to draw down the balance of the account , never paying a dime in tax . You guys are cold-cocked , the agent added . Robbie laughed now , very briefly , repeating the words . I did n't ask how Robbie and his partner could have ever believed a scheme so simpleminded would work . I was long accustomed to the dumb ways people get themselves in trouble . Besides , the fact was that their scam had operated smoothly for years . A checking account that paid no interest was unlikely to come to the Service 's attention . It was , frankly , noteworthy that it had , a development that would inevitably be traced to freak coincidence , or , if things were spicier , betrayal . Feaver had heard out the agents in his living room . He was perched on a camelback sofa smartly upholstered in bleached silk , trying to contain himself . To smile . Stay slick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unexpected sensation of a single cold rill of his own sweat tracking the length of his side until it was absorbed in the elastic waistband of his boxers . And the good news ? he asked on second effort . They were getting to that , the agent said . The good news was that Robbie had an opportunity . Maybe there was something he could do for himself . Something that a person with his family situation ought to consider . The agent then walked across the marble foyer and opened the front door . The United States Attorney , Stan Sennett , was standing on Robbie 's doorstep . Feaver recognized him from TV , a short man , slender , kempt with a compulsive orderliness . A few gnats zagged madly under the light above the careful part in Sennett 's head . He greeted Feaver with his in-court expression , humorless as a hatchet blade . Robbie had never practiced a day of criminal law , but he knew what it meant that the United States Attorney was standing in person on his front stoop late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight at him . It meant they wanted to make him an example . It meant he 'd never get away . In his terror , Robbie Feaver found a single useful thought . I want a lawyer , he said . He was entitled , Sennett finally responded . But perhaps Robbie should listen to him first . As soon as Sennett set a polished brogan across the threshold , Robbie repeated himself . I ca n't promise the deal will be the same tomorrow , Sennett told him . Lawyer , Feaver said again . The agents took over then , offering advice . If he was going to an attorney , find a good one , someone who 'd been around . Talk to that lawyerand no one else . Not Mom . Not the wife . And certainly not his law partner , Dinnerstein . The U.S. Attorney passed one agent his card , and the agent handed it to Feaver . Sennett would be waiting for Feaver 's lawyer 's call . About to step down into the darkness , the prosecutor asked over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sennett told Feaver with a shallow smile when he heard my name . " I 'm not a rat , " Robbie Feaver said now . " That 's the play , right , George ? They want me to dime somebody out . " I asked if he had any idea who . " Well , it better not be Mort . My partner ? Never . There 's nothing to say about Mort . " Feaver and Dinnerstein were lifelong friends , he told me , next-door neighbors as boys growing up in the Jewish enclave of Warren Park , here in DuSable , roommates through college and law school . But their secret account was joint , both men had made deposits and written the checks to cash , and neither had reported the income . There was enough damaging paper that it seemed unlikely the IRS was going to need anyone 's assistance to install either one of them in the trophy case . I asked if there might be something else the government wanted Robbie to tell them about Mort , or any other person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not know Robbie Feaver well . When he 'd called this morning , he 'd reminded me that we 'd met several times in the lobby of the LeSueur Building where we each had our law offices , and of the committee work he 'd done for the Kindle County Bar Association a couple of years ago during my term as president . My memories of him were vague and not necessarily pleasant . Measured according to the remaining reflexes of a proper Southern upbringing , he was the kind of fellow who 'd be described simply as too much . ' Too good-looking in the sense that he was too well aware of it . Too much stiff , dark hair that reflected too much fussing . He was tanned in every season and spent too much money on his clotheshigh-styled Italian suits and snazzy foulardsaccompanied by too much jewelry . He spoke too loudly , and too eagerly to strangers in the elevator . In fact , in any setting , he talked too muchone of those people who went one up on Descartes : I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent virtue : he could have told you all of that . Diminished by fear , he maintained an air of candor , at least about himself . As clients went , therefore , he seemed , on first impression , better than average . When I asked what the agent had meant about his family , he sagged a bit . " Sick wife , " he said , " sick mother . " Waging a running war against the medical establishment , Feaver , like many personal injury attorneys , had absorbed the lexicon of physicians . His mother was in a nursing home . " CVA , " he said , meaning a stroke . His wife , Lorraine , was worse . She had been diagnosed nearly two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosisALS , or more commonly Lou Gehrig 's diseaseand was on a certain downward course toward total paralysis and , eventually , death . " She 's got a year maybe before things get really hairy , no one knows for sure . " He was stoical but his black eyes did not rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave her . Not practically . There 's nobody else to take care of her . " That was the agent 's point . Feaver would talk or be in the penitentiary when his wife reached the point of total helplessness or passed . The dark shroud of that prospect fell over us both . In the resulting silence , I picked up Sennett 's card , which Feaver had laid on my desk . Without it , I might have questioned whether Robbie had identified the right man on his doorstep . The United States Attorney , with ninety-two assistants and several hundred cases to supervise , would ordinarily have no direct role in a straightforward tax case , even one against a successful personal injury lawyer . Whatever Stan Sennett had come to Robbie 's house to say last night must have been a mouthful . " What did it mean , " Feaver asked , " when Sennett said that George Mason would be an interesting choice ? Does he hate your guts or think you 're a pushover ? " It was complicated , I responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a close friend . " Well , that 's good , then , is n't it ? " Feaver asked . When it came to Stan Sennett , I never knew the answer . Sometimes friends , I told Feaver . Always rivals .
