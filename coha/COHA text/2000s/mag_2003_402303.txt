Lovably foulmouthed New Pornographer NEKO CASE sounds off about stuff that ticks her off , but will she take it off ... for Playboy ? BY KAREN VALBY // WE LOVE NEKO CASE . We love her hot head of red hair and her sweet-ass voice . We love her three country-tinged solo albums , especially her most recent , Blacklisted . We love that she sings with the Canadian pop band the New Pornographers ( whose new album , Electric Version , we also adore ) and that there will be 38 chances to see her on tour with them this summer . We love that Playboy.com readers had the good sense to vote her the " sexiest babe in indie rock . " And we love that during an interview , Case , 32 , swears like a surly barmaid while savoring cinnamon ice cream . Listen2This How do you feel about being lumped in the alt.country genre ? Neko Case I do n't know anybody who does n't hate being called alt.country . It just sounds like a website . I do n't mind being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noir , or independent country is fine , but the words alt.country make me insane . L2T What else makes you mad ? NC When did this trend start where people just piss all over the toilet seats ? ! I do n't care if you piss all over it and then wipe it off-it 's still living f-ing germs all over the seat . It 's like , " Sit the f- down ! " L2T After you won their online poll , Playboy recently asked you to pose in the buff . Any interest ? NC I decided I was n't going to do it because I did n't want to be the girl who posed in Playboy and then-by the way-made some music . I would be really f-ing irritated if after a show somebody came up to me and handed me some naked picture of myself and wanted me to sign it instead of my CD . L2T Why did the New Pornographers give a shout-out to The Onion in the liner notes to Electric Version " ? NC The Onion is the greatest newspaper in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current state of politics , they 're willing to make fun of George Bush when no one else is . Everybody is just too scared , especially when people do really s-ty things , like targeting the Dixie Chicks . L2T You 're a fan ? NC They 're fellow musicians , and they 're fellow women , and I 'm going to stick up for them . I was on a plane to Nashville and I was reading a magazine that the Dixie Chicks were on the cover of . Thanks for reading , Neko . The guy next to me said something about how the Dixie Chicks are so goddamn stupid , and I said , " You do n't know a f-ing thing about me , leave me alone . " And then he just went off blah-dee-blah about the President , and I said , " I hate the President and I 'm not sorry , so leave me the f-alone . " I 'm all mad . Laughing Sorry , I can get a little ranty . L2T Are you satisfied with your level of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge as , say , the Dixie Chicks ? NC I would be a huge hypocrite if I did n't tell you that at one time in my life I thought the way that you made music was you got on a major label and you got famous . Before I made my second album I had some offers , and then those offers disappeared and I was disappointed . But just because some guy is a noted producer does n't mean he 's going to come in and make your album a hit . It does n't even mean he 's going to like your music ! In the end I remained with my friends , and it 's paid off . L2T You 've collaborated with the likes of Kelly Hogan , Calexico , and the Sadies . Who else would you love to work with ? NC If I could ever be on a Missy Elliott record , I could then die . Missy Elliott , Mary J. Blige-I love hearing them interviewed , I love the way they talk about their art . They 're very self-assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it . L2T With so much heat around your solo career , is there any weird tension within the New Pornographers ? NC I do n't really do interviews for the New Pornographers anymore , because when our band first started people decided it was my band . But the fact is it 's Carl 's Newman band . But the guys could care less about that stuff . We all want the same thing-we just want to play music and we want to get it out to as big of an audience as we can without compromising ourselves . L2T I read somewhere that all the New Pornographers really want to do is make music that gets people dancing . NC The dance party is still alive and well in our band ! The guys came over to my house for a photo shoot a few weeks ago and we ended up having a dance party . We really like old punk rock and ' ' 80s new wave . L2T I 've always wondered : What exactly is ' ' 80s new wave ? NC You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like Blondie would be like , " Aghhh , new wave ! If I hear that term again , I 'm going to kill someone ! " Sidebar GET MORE ON EW.COM How well do you know the bands in this issue ?
