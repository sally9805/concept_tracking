There are two ways to view the large hole opposite city hall in Nauvoo , Ill . One way is Mayor Tom Wilson 's ; he gives it a glance each morning on his way to work . The other is from a nearby roof , where a camera transmits one photo every minute of the workday to a website run by a Utah company called Deseret Book . That 's 540 exposures a day . Few go to waste . Since January the site has had 6 million hits , most by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . Nothing is too minor or boring for the electronic audience . " To watch the pattern and progress of the concrete placement , " the site recently instructed , " check the archive images from noon on May 19th , and continue throughout the afternoon . " Some might call this obsessive . To the physical residents of Nauvoo it is , well , unnerving . <P> Hamlets all along the Mississippi are searching for a picturesque and salable past . But Nauvoo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two histories and two identities . In the mid-19th century the Mormons built a gleaming capital here , only to be bloodily expelled within seven years . The excavation symbolizes their return . From it will grow an exact , $25 million replica of the first great Mormon temple , torched by arsonists in 1848 . Through it the Latter-day Saints will recover a key part of their past and achieve a kind of redemption . The irony is that in doing so , they may erase the identity of the community of 1,200 people that grew up in the interim . " We felt , hey , you 're going to take away our quiet little town , " says John McCarty , a Nauvoo city council member . " But the church never had a concept of that . They were just going to get their temple . " <P> When Joseph Smith first arrived in Illinois in 1839 , his people were in dire straits . Smith , who claimed to have received the Book of Mormon from the angel Moroni 12 years earlier , had attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one frontier town after another and ejected from Missouri under threat of death . Yet within three years the new town of Nauvoo boasted 1,500 log homes and shops and 350 brick buildings . Its militia counted 4,000 men , roughly half the size of the U.S. Army at the time . Its visual and spiritual centerpiece was to be a magnificent white limestone temple , with a 165-ft. steeple visible for miles . <P> But the Saints ' neighbors grew nervous about a heavily armed theocracy in their midst . In 1844 Smith was jailed , then shot dead by a mob and his flock harassed . In 1846 , their temple barely completed , they reluctantly embarked on an extraordinary trek . It would produce another mighty settlement , near the Great Salt Lake . But Nauvoo , says Richard Ostling , co-author of the book Mormon America , quickly attained the status of a lost ideal : " the thorough expression of the Mormon kingdom of God on earth .
