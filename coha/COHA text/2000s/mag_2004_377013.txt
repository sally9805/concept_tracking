Sigourney Weaver stars in Imaginary Heroes , a movie about a family falling apart that still manages to be funny . It previews next week and opens across the country next month . <P> Director Dan Harris is 25 . Was it odd taking orders from a kid ? <P> Luckily , I 'm very immature , so I do n't feel he 's that much younger . He must be an old soul . Age is one of those things that does n't make any difference if you know what you 're doing . <P> Your character in this movie smokes a fair amount of pot . Any worries about how your real-life teenage daughter might take that ? <P> Well , she has n't seen the movie . I think that she 'd understand it was escapist . <P> She has n't seen all your movies ? <P> Her life is much more interesting than watching her mother in a movie . She 's certainly never seen any of the Alien movies . What 's nice is that they 're there . It 's a record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carried that flamethrower . " <P> What do you think of female action-adventure stars today ? <P> I was lucky to have the directors I had . When I first appeared as Ripley , I came down in this little pastel costume , and Ridley Scott said , " You look like Jackie Onassis in space . " And we found the flight suit I ended up wearing . When I see the costumes they put their women heroes in today , they 're so impractical . They 've probably been told by the studio , " She has to kick ass , but we got ta really see those legs . " <P> Your drama teachers at Yale told you that you had no talent . Anything you want to say to them now ? <P> Oh , my goodness me . Years of therapy , and here I have my opening . <P> Take the low road . <P> I hope they 're all sitting watching my movies late at night , eating cat food out of a can .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
