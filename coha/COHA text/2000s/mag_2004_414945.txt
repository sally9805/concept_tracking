Invite friends and family to gather around the table . Then share a memorable meal while celebrating traditions old and new . // ah , the sunday roast For many Americans , having a roast for Sunday dinner is as certain as the day itself . And not just any roast , but succulent roast beef , savory sage-rubbed pork loin , rosemary-scented leg of lamb , or a glistening , golden-skinned roasted chicken-each one filling the house with incredible aroma , the scents of which memories are made . During the week , we might have a casserole , order takeout , or even grab something on the run . But on Sundays we serve our very best ! FOOD STYLING BY WILLIAM SMITH . PROP STYLING BY BETTE BLAU .

In small towns or the mosaic of big-city neighborhoods , the indelible aromas , laden with anticipation , drifted down the street , beckoning us home and calling us inside to the warmth and fellowship that is family . Sunday dinner represents something we secretly crave-a regular time set aside for celebration , and a weekly refuge of traditions , love , and laughter . In a sense , Sunday dinner is a gift that we give to one another , a gift we pass on to our children and our children 's children . And , of course , there is the great food . So join us , if you will ; it 's Sunday , and dinner 's ready . EACH AND EVERY SUNDAY CAN BECOME A MUCH ANTICIPATED AND LONG-REMEMBERED REUNION remembrances of sunday dinners past Around the family table in the quiet , unhurried atmosphere of a Sunday afternoon , conversation can linger on through dessert and well into the second cup of coffee . It is here , without the interruptions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after being excused from the table , can wander off for conversations of their own . I learned early on that having little never meant having less . Personal touches-a simple table bright with garden flowers or an heirloom vase-make the meal special . The china may not be showpiece quality , but it gleams with meaning . From the moment we smooth the cloth , our everyday table-once piled with homework-can become a place to build fond memories . During the week , as we rushed here and there , it was difficult to give important family milestones their due . Sunday was a time we could celebrate all of those birthdays or anniversaries that fell within a month . We 'd get a store-bought cake large enough for all to share and blow out the candles together .
