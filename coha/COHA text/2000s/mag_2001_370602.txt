If I have one problem with rap music , and this is one of my only complaints , it 's that cats are stuck in the grind of using the same beats per minute all the time . But rhythm and tempo are elements that the Roots always mess around with . They 're a great band , and they can give you any kind of vibe , from a lighthearted , Stetsasonic kind of groove to a jazzy , a Tribe Called Quest feel , but they always go out of their way to experiment and stay responsible to their own point of view . I think their objective is pretty clear : they 're trying to bring a true musical aesthetic to rap . <P> The group  --  Tariq ( Black Thought ) Trotter , drummer Ahmir ( ? uestlove ) Thompson , keyboardist Kamal Gray , bassist Leonard ( Hub ) Hubbard , vocal percussionists Kyle ( Scratch ) Jones and Rozell ( Rahzel ) Brown not pictured and Malik ( Malik B. ) Abdul-Bassit  --  is time tested . In various incarnations , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uestlove with his big Afro behind the drum kit , you know you 're going to get a good show . <P> That brings us to the most important part : you 've got to be able to perform live , to get in front of the public and sweat for them . Nobody sweats better than the Roots . They knew early on that because their music is kind of esoteric , they would n't have immediate , top of the chart-type appeal in the U.S. So , as we in Public Enemy did , they went around the world first . They scoured countries trying to build their reputation and audience the right way , by paying their dues two or three hours at a time in places such as Ljubljana , Slovenia , that most Americans have n't heard of . That 's an everlasting statement of their commitment to the craft , and it 's one of the criteria that separate them from the Wu-Tang Clan and other great hip-hop acts . Wu-Tang has as many seeds of interest across the world as the Roots do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds and water them . You 've got to be able to get in front of the public and make your music come to life . <P> In music today you can make a political statement just by not being stupid for the sake of popularity . A lot of groups are dumbing themselves down to be popular with a whole bunch of 13- and 14-year-olds . The Roots , whose members are mostly in their late 20s , say , " Forget that . We 're not kids . We 're not pretending to be . We 're hip-hop , and we 'll lay it out on the line , and eventually we 'll attract them . " <P> I have a way of evaluating musicians that I like to call the MOVE theory . M is for music , O is for objective , V is for visual recognition , E is for entertainment value or how a band plays live . How do the Roots stack up ? Right at the top . <P> Chuck D is a co-founder of the group Public Enemy and of   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
