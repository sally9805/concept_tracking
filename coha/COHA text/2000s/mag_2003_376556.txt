Remember Fahrvergnugen , the German tongue twister that Volkswagen adopted for ad campaigns in the early 1990s to express the thrill of driving its cheap , dependable , even lovable cars ? For VW owner Ann Jones of Corona , Calif. , the experience has been more like far from groovin ' . Jones was lured to the Jetta by its stylish looks , elegant interior and solid road handling , which made it seem worth the $18,900 price . But a few months after bringing her new sedan home in 2000 , she returned it to the dealer because of an oil leak . <P> Then a door lock broke . Then a spring popped out of a seat . By the time she had put 50,000 miles on her Jetta , it already felt sluggish , says Jones , 28 . And what especially disturbed her were the grim faces of fellow VW owners whom she encountered at her dealership . " The majority of them were n't there for basic service " of their cars , she says , " but because of some defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that Jones received a rare lemon . But in the latest survey of three-year depend-ability by J.D. Power &; Associates , American consumers ranked VW-brand cars 34th , ahead of only Suzuki , Daewoo , Land Rover and Kia . Consumer Reports , which recommended three VW models in the late 1990s , keeps only the pricey Passat on its list of recommended cars . That 's quite a tumble for the Volkswagen Group , Europe 's largest automaker , which turns out 5 million units a year under brands including Audi , Bugatti , Seat and Skoda . <P> These quality issues are raising concerns about VW 's hold on the North American market  --  the largest and most vibrant in the world , and a critical one for VW 's profit growth . While VW is puttering along in Europe 's anemic market  --  the firm has an 18% share in Western Europe and has sold almost 2 million cars in the first nine months of 2003  --  it is struggling on this continent . The VW brand 's U.S. sales fell 14.6% over that same period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $68 million in the first six months of the year , down from $944 million during the same period in 2002 . While North American sales accounted for just 20% of Volkswagen 's $101 billion in global revenues in 2002 , they delivered 27% of its $5.4 billion in operating profits . And VW clearly aims higher : around a third of its $1.6 billion global ad budget is spent in the U.S. <P> The man in charge of revving up Volkswagen is CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder , who took over from the domineering Ferdinand Piech in April 2002 . A personable , goateed man who ran BMW from 1993 to 1999 , Pischetsrieder , 55 , is pursuing a risky sales strategy inherited from Piech : pushing his flagship brand into the U.S. luxury arena , where vehicle profit margins are higher than in the mid-priced segment in which VW typically competes . At the same time , he is wringing costs out of manufacturing through design changes and by getting relief from VW 's expensive German work force . The firm recently announced that net profit was down 51% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CFO Hans Dieter Potsch warned that the firm would take a charge of " a couple hundred million " euros this quarter to offset R.-and-D. costs .
