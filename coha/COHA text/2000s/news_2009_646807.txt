BROOKINGS , S.D.  --  Jenn Warkenthien 's dream of playing basketball at South Dakota State was shaped at a small-town garage sale . As a grade-schooler , she paid 25 cents for a pair of blue mesh workout shorts . <p> " Most of all , I liked that they were SDSU shorts and that they had ' South Dakota State in gold lettering , " Warkenthien says . " I still use them . The shorts are awesome . They mean everything to me . " <p> Now , Warkenthien ( pronounced Work-en-teen ) is the center of a story that has gripped basketball fans on the frozen prairie of eastern South Dakota . She has endured the death of both parents and is leading the Jackrabbits in a season for the ages , one that could culminate in their first appearance in the NCAA Division I women 's tournament . <p> The Jacks , in their fifth Division I season and their first season of eligibility for a national title , play in the little-known Summit League . They are ranked No. 18 in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon , Minnesota , Wisconsin , Utah and Gonzaga . <p> The Jacks can qualify for the NCAA tournament by winning the league tournament , which starts March 7 in Sioux Falls , S.D. If not , they 'll hope for an at-large bid . <p> Warkenthien , 21 , an early childhood education major with a near-perfect GPA , is a 6-0 senior forward with versatility . She plays the post , shoots from the perimeter and makes precision passes . She leads the Jacks in scoring ( 15.3 points a game ) , rebounding ( 8.6 a game ) , assists ( 2.3 ) , blocks ( 1.1 ) , steals ( 1.5 ) and field goal percentage ( 51.9 ) . <p> " Jenn 's a nurturing soul , always encouraging her teammates , " Jacks coach Aaron Johnston , 34 , says . " She 's fun-loving and lighthearted . She 's not goofy . She 's mature beyond her years . " <p> The Jacks averaged a school-record 2,803 fans at home this season , with as many as 70 fans from her hometown of Willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rocking Frost Arena will be stamped into her mind forever . <p> " It 's a special place filled with amazing fans , " she said after she played her final home game there Feb. 16 , scoring 19 points in an 87-42 win vs . Southern Utah . " I love the atmosphere . It 's helped me through tough times . It 's more than basketball . It 's seeing the excitement of 80-year-olds and 8-year-olds enjoying every minute and looking forward to the next game . " <p> But there 's also hurt that her parents are missing it . Her mom , Charlene , a nurse who liked bowling and was known for singing solos in church , died when Warkenthien was 7 . Her dad , Loren , a farmer , died of a heart infection during the finals week of her freshman year , leaving Jenn and her younger sister Kayla to live on a farm with Loren 's parents , Elwood and Barbara . <p> " At the same time that I lost my dad , they lost their son , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " Warkenthien says . " My grandpa taught me to have courage . He used to tell me , and still does , ' Got ta have courage . My grandma taught me how to be strong when it seems impossible . " <p> Warkenthien , who wears No. 44 to match her younger sister 's high school uniform number , says she has no memories of her mom . She breaks down in tears as she tells about how her dad never missed a Jacks home game , once flew to Florida on his birthday to see her play and pinned a button , with a picture of his daughters , on his shirt before each game . <p> " We take a minute to ourselves before each game , and that 's when I always let him know I 'm thinking of him , " she says . " He was my No. 1 fan . I know he 's watching every game , and if we need a miracle shot , he 's going to help . " <p> Loving father <p> Helping his daughters would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his daughters the quintessential small-town roots and love of community . Warkenthien grew up in two towns  --  Lake Norden ( population 424 ) and Willow Lake ( 320 ) , each within about an hour 's drive of Brookings . <p> Loren served on the town council in Lake Norden and the school board in Willow Lake and was always helping neighbors with chores and driving his daughters and their friends to events . <p> " He was a big man , with a tender heart , like Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza , " Lake Norden Mayor Janet Andrews says . <p> Loren bagged dried milk and ran a forklift at Lake Norden 's creamery but moved to Willow Lake to farm so work did n't conflict with his daughters activities . " When you farm , you are the boss . When you want to go , you go , " says Al Hamre , one of Loren 's high school classmates in Willow Lake . <p> After Loren died , the family received 1,200 cards . There was n't a church big enough to handle the funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hamre , a farmer and school bus driver , was like an adopted uncle to the Warkenthien sisters , and he coached Jenn in fifth grade . He also was the assistant for Jenn 's Willow Lake Pirates team . <p> Hamre shot baskets with her , and helped her learn fundamentals . He toughened her with a game called " Bloody Nose . " <p> In it , Hamre put three girls under the basket and tossed the ball so they had to go after the rebound : " It was anything goes , which means they hammered each other . It got physical . " <p> At Willow Lake High , in a class of 21 , Warkenthien was the valedictorian and a basketball star who made three Class B All-State teams and played for Pirates teams that finished runner-up twice in the state tournament . <p> " She 's a big influence on kids in our town , " says Nicole Tonak , a secretary who lives in Willow Lake . " She writes kids letters . She comes to see her sister play . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they use at state . " <p> Kayla , 18 , is a 6-foot senior post player , and her team , Clark-Willow Lake , is 16-2 and ranked No. 7 in the state going into today 's district tournament . She 'll attend SDSU next fall but is n't going to play basketball . <p> Jenn finished her Pirates years with 1,795 points and 1,001 rebounds and followed in the footsteps of another Pirates star , Lisa Kannegieter , who along with Jenn , is among the 26 members of the Jacks 1,000-point club . <p> Small-town calling <p> SDSU coach Johnston followed Warkenthien in high school but did n't need to . She always wanted to play for the Jacks , even though the University of South Dakota and Colorado State called . " SDSU felt normal , " Warkenthien says . <p> Warkenthien scored 14 points with 14 rebounds in a 70-36 road win vs . North Dakota State on Saturday night ( her 10th double-double of the season ) , moving her into ninth place on the Jacks career rebounding list ( 718 ) and 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston says he gets calls from agents who would like to talk to Warkenthien about playing professionally , possibly overseas , but she says no . " She 's not excited about the lights and glamour , " he says . " This could change , but she has n't been banging down my door to talk about the options . " <p> Instead , on June 20 , Warkenthien plans to marry Blake Hojer , her high school sweetheart and a former football player from a neighboring town , De Smet . He 's going to work on his family 's cattle ranch . They 've picked out a house in Oldham , S.D. , population 181 , and she 'll pursue a career as a grade-school teacher and help her husband run bull sales . <p> Teaching is a dream for her . " This sounds nerdy , " she says , " but I liked school and going there to see all my friends . I used to like to play school . I had two big chalkboards and pretended that I was teaching . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me understand the value of relationships with people in a small town and how they 'll last a lifetime , " she says . " I like living in an area where everyone knows everyone else . It 'd be hard to live in a different country . It 's peaceful here . Nothing feels better than being around home . I want to be a small-town girl forever . " <p> And , the SDSU shorts that she bought for a quarter ? They became even more special when Jenn learned that they belonged to Kannegieter , now a high school coach in Pierre , S.D. <p> " My kids are going to wear those shorts some day , " Warkenthien says . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
