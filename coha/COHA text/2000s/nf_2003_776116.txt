Magic and Mystery in a Unique Place // The last time I was in Washington , D.C. , I walked by the White House on the way to dinner at a nearby restaurant . Hidden floodlights made the historic building glow like a mansion in a vision or a dream . Suddenly I thought : I am not the woman who lived in that house more than fifty years ago . She is a completely different person . I barely know her . // The words whispered in my mind like a voice from another world . I was remembering , or trying to remember , what it meant to be the daughter of the president of the United States , living in that shining shimmering house . The one inescapable thing I recalled was the difference . I have lived in several houses and apartments , and spent some time in splendid establishments , including a few royal palaces . But not one of them-or all of them together-can compare to the feeling I recalled from my White House days . // That was when I resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrifying , exalting , dangerous , fascinating houses in the world . It is a house that has changed people in amazing , unexpected ways . It is a house that has broken hearts and minds . It is a house that has made some people weep when they walked out the door for the last time-and others feel like escapees from a maximum security prison . Some marriages have been saved within those pristine white walls . Others have been irrevocably ruined . // Children have played marvelously clever games inside and outside this unique piece of architecture . Other children have twisted and turned in their death throes while their weeping parents , arguably the most powerful persons on the North American continent , clutched them in their impotent arms . In those same second-floor bedrooms , radiant brides have dressed in virginal white and descended to meet loving husbands as the world applauded . // Once , one of these brides married a president . I am speaking of Frances Folsom and Grover Cleveland . A century or so ago , when I was a twenty-something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me the reason she was married in the White House instead of in her family home : Nowhere else could she and the president have their privacy guaranteed . // The old house is , to put it mildly , a paradoxical place . People who think in straight lines have a very difficult time adjusting to it . And as history has shown again and again , many of them never do . Even so , I think everyone who has ever lived in the White House would agree that it 's a special experience-a unique combination of history , tragedy , comedy , melodrama , and the ups and downs of ordinary living all under one roof . // II // Men bearing that unique title , president of the United States , the office my father called " the greatest in the history of the world , " have paced the White House 's darkened halls in periods of national crisis , gazing at portraits of their predecessors on the walls , seeking communion with their triumphs-or shuddering at their blunders . Women reached out to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very least solace for their awesome burdens . My mother managed to play both roles in my father 's presidency-a feat too many obtuse historians and biographers have failed to recognize . // In the basement and attic rooms are the memories of the hundreds of other people who lived a large part of their working lives in this unique house , and experienced its aura of power and history . Their stories belong in this book , too . Some , I regret to say , were slaves . But the house , paradoxical as always , gradually became a place where free African-Americans demonstrated their right to equality . // Maggie Rogers began working as a White House maid when William Howard Taft became president in 1909 . Her daughter , Lillian Rogers Parks , was hired as a seamstress at the White House in 1929 and worked until the end of the Eisenhower administration in 1961 . Growing up , Lillian once asked her mother if she would be happier ( and better paid ) at some millionaire 's mansion elsewhere in the capital . Maggie Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be it ever so elegant , there 's no place like the White House . Why , I 'm living history ! " There was black pride and White House pride achieving a magical fusion . // Also worth commemorating are the efforts of the dedicated , courageous , amazingly patient men who have struggled to keep presidents and their families alive in the often malevolent glare of public criticism and spasms of national hatred . We know them now as members of the Secret Service . But their predecessors are equally memorable , standing guard at the White House 's doors in suits that were a size too large for them-to conceal their pistols . Most people , including some of the presidents they guarded , were unaware of those hidden weapons . // There is a side to these protectors that few people know about , much less appreciate-the many acts of kindness and thoughtfulness they perform for presidents and first ladies . Perhaps the most touching story comes from the sad days of President Woodrow Wilson 's decline . Felled by a stroke , he sank into near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the League of Nations . // When the crippled president went for a ride in the afternoon , the Secret Service used to round up a small crowd of government employees and strolling tourists , who waited at the White House gate to cheer him when he returned . It was a pathetic illusion , but a testament to how much these men cared about the president . // III // Perhaps the most intriguing White House denizens are the men and women who have worked beside presidents as their spokespersons or confidential advisers . More than anyone , they often shared the reflected glow of White House power . Not all of them were able to deal with it rationally or responsibly , though the vast majority have managed it . For many of them , the experience was more than a little harrowing-and in a few cases , fatal . // I am thinking of one of my most heartbreaking White House memories-the death of my father 's boyhood friend and press secretary , Charlie Ross . Charlie went through high school with Harry Truman and went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . When my father turned to him for help in 1945 , Charlie gave up a comfortable salary and rational hours for the ordeal of a White House in which clocks and sensible schedules ceased to exist . Five exhausting years later , during the frantic early months of the Korean War , when newsmen besieged the White House twenty-four hours a day , Charlie Ross collapsed and died of a heart attack at his desk . A weeping Harry Truman said the country had lost a great public servant-and he had lost his best friend . // IV // That memory leads us to another cadre of White House inhabitants , although many presidents and their families might be reluctant to bestow that title on them : the men and women of the media . They , too , participate in the aura of the White House-to the point where they sometimes act as if they run the place . I had a vivid reminder of this mind-set when I came to the White House to talk with Hillary Clinton in 1994 about my book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House policeman told me to enter the mansion through the press briefing room in the West Wing . The minute I stepped through the doorway , a half dozen reporters surrounded me . Why was I there ? To advise Hillary on how to improve her performance as First Lady ? What did I think of Hillary 's latest hairstyle ? Should she hold more press conferences la Eleanor Roosevelt , or fewer la Bess Truman ( who held none at all ) ? I smiled sweetly and said " No comment " to these attempts to get me to put my foot in my mouth . // My favorite White House media story comes from my friend President Gerald Ford . Gerry says he and veteran newswoman Helen Thomas were strolling on a street near the White House when he saw one of those old-fashioned scales that gave you your fortune and weight for a penny . Gerry read the little fortune card aloud : " You are a marvelous orator and leader of men . Your future in your chosen career could not be brighter . " // Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got your weight wrong , too . " // As the wife ( now widow ) of a newspaperman , I recognize the necessity for such irreverence . As the daughter of a president , I do n't have to like it . But I am prepared to include it , somewhat ruefully , in the White House 's story . // V // The White House is far more than the place where presidents and hundreds of staffers work and presidential families live . It is also the place where America 's pride and dignity as a sovereign nation are displayed . At official dinners and receptions , when the president enters the room to the U.S. Marine Band 's resounding " Hail to the Chief , " people recognize not only a powerful man but the nation , the United States of America . The immense amount of time and effort that presidents and first ladies and the White House staff devote to entertaining visitors from around the country and the world is a fascinating and important story . It , too , is part of the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They range from the king and queen of England , whose snobbish servants started an uncivil war with the White House staff , to Russian grand dukes and Japanese noblemen , from world renowned politicians such as Winston Churchill , who gave himself a mild heart attack trying to open his bedroom window , to Cherokee and Creek and Sioux Indian chiefs , who did war dances on the lawn . Marvelous musicians such as pianist Vladimir Horowitz , soprano Jessye Norman , and cellist Pablo Casals ( who performed for the Theodore Roosevelts in 1901 and for the John F. Kennedys sixty years later ) have filled presidential ears with beautiful music . Entertainers such as Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand have made the place sound , for a few hours , like Broadway . Thick-necked political bosses have more than once converted the president 's second-floor study or the Oval Office in the West Wing into smoke-filled rooms , where political careers were empowered-or destroyed . // VI // Admission to the White House has never been restricted solely to the elite . From the earliest days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted anyone and everyone who wanted to come in the door . Some of these early receptions make picturesque reading . Several turned into mob scenes that threatened to ruin the rugs and wreck the furniture-and even made one or two chief executives fear for their lives . // Presidents and their staffs soon learned they had to set limits to White House access if they wanted to have time to conduct the nation 's business . Doorkeepers and appointments secretaries began screening scheduled visitors . But the tradition of the White House as the people 's house lived on-and is alive and well in contemporary Washington . // You used to be able to stroll by 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue any day you chose , rain or shine , and see a long line of tourists-part of the million and a half Americans who streamed through the first-floor public rooms each year . As a small d as well as a large D democrat , that statistic has always gladdened my heart . Visiting the White House in person is a little like meeting a celebrity face-to-face . You get impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book-ca n't communicate . After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and during the war with Iraq in the spring of 2003 , tours were temporarily suspended because of concerns about security . Group tours , which have to be arranged in advance , were eventually reinstated . I hope it wo n't be too much longer before the tours for the general public will also be resumed . // VII // The idea that the White House is the people 's house has caused fierce quarrels every time a president or first lady tried to change the building in any significant way . There are squadrons of unofficial custodians , and not a few official guardians , who mount the media ramparts to hurl vituperation at the hapless first couple . John Quincy Adams was pilloried for buying a billiard table . Millard Fillmore was attacked for putting in a bathtub. // Grace Coolidge caused an uproar when she tried to redecorate the family quarters with furniture in the style of the period in which the White House was built . Ironically , Jacqueline Kennedy did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was wildly acclaimed for her efforts . When my father added a balcony to the South Portico , you would have sworn from the screams that impeachment was just around the corner . // Then there are the media and congressional snipers who are ready to open fire if they detect the slightest hint of snobbery or pretentiousness in the president 's lifestyle . This has caused chief executives and first ladies no end of grief , and was largely responsible for depriving at least one president , Martin Van Buren , of a second term in the White House . // Van Buren had served as Andrew Jackson 's vice president , which all by itself made him a ripe target for the Whigs ( forerunners of the Republicans ) who were against anyone or anything connected with Jackson . On top of that , Van Buren liked to live , dress , and entertain in style , which made it easy to cast him as a decadent aristocrat. // The opening salvo was fired at a dinner at the President 's House when a Whig congressman picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his constituents in Kentucky , they would rush to vote Van Buren out of office . The gold spoons , like most of the other furnishings , had been in the White House before Van Buren moved in , but that did n't stop another Whig congressman , Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania . // In the spring of 1840 , a few months before Van Buren began his campaign for reelection , the House of Representatives was considering a bill to allot $3,665 for landscaping the grounds and repairing the furniture in the President 's House . Ogle took advantage of the occasion to launch a passionate diatribe against Van Buren. // Taking his listeners on an imaginary tour of the " Presidential Palace , " Ogle commented on its " regal splendor , " which far exceeded " the grand saloons at Buckingham Palace . . . . " He condemned the president 's bonbon stands and green glass finger bowls and assailed him for serving fancy French food instead of such old-fashioned favorites as " hog and hominy " or " fried meat and gravy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of castigating Van Buren for living like a king at public expense , he managed to inject more than a few comments about the down-home virtues of the Whig presidential candidate , William Henry Harrison . //
