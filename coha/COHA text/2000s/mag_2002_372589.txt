Poor little rich kids have never evoked much sympathy . How could they ? Most of us aspire to have their problems . Yet substantial wealth , especially when it 's acquired suddenly and early , can be both isolating and debilitating . Just try distinguishing genuine friends from parasites after you 've come into a few mil . Even heirs who do n't turn paranoid may become lazy and unproductive , and ultimately unfulfilled . <P> A co-founder of Ben &; Jerry 's Homemade Ice Cream , Ben Cohen once told me he will give most of his tens of millions to charity and leave just $1 million to his daughter , a nice cushion but not enough to live well on without working . Other rich folks , including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett , have similar plans to spare their heirs what wealth advisers call " affluenza , " an affliction that was fleetingly pandemic during the dotcom daze . Wealth doctors have lost a few patients since then . But even as stocks have slumped , home prices have swelled . Household net worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tax changes this year raise the limit on annual tax-free gifts to $11,000 a person ( for as many people as you want to enrich ) , up from $10,000 . You can leave $1 million free from estate tax , up from $675,000 . The top marginal estate-tax rate drops to 50% from 55% . <P> Over the next 15 years , heirs will come into more than $10 trillion , and most will rejoice . But those who are n't prepared may find that sudden wealth complicates their life . " I 've seen kids in the inheritance business , " says Don Weigandt , an adviser at J.P . Morgan Private Bank . " All they ever thought about was how to get Dad 's money . What happens after they get it ? " <P> Wealth advisers say that your heirs should be told by their teens if they stand to inherit a sizable amount and should start learning how to manage it . Early disclosure gives you time to groom them for a life of philanthropy , civic duty or other worthy pursuits , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that your heirs are prepared , test them with an early gift and see what they do with it . If they mess up  --  say , by blowing it all on a series of vacations and paying for their friends too  --  or seem as if they 're just waiting for you to die to get the rest , you may need to build in safeguards and incentives through a customized trust . A basic trust typically releases an inheritance in thirds , at ages 25 , 30 and 35 . But it can be designed to reward achievement , like graduating from college or starting a business or holding a job . <P> Such incentive trusts are a hot topic in estate-planning circles , in which the issue of how to leave money behind without ruining your heirs is getting almost as much attention as tax planning . In Beyond the Grave , authors Gerald and Jeffrey Condon argue that incentives do n't work . " True character can not be molded by money , " they write . " You can not salvage by inheritance what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But others endorse incentive trusts as a useful way to motivate silver-spoon heirs . " Provide a resource , not an entitlement , " says Joanne Johnson , a wealth-adviser manager at J.P . Morgan Private Bank .
