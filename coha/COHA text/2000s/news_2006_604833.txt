<p> What makes a student an academic star ? <p> Brains alone are not enough . Most top students have somebody  --  usually many somebodies  --  providing the guidance and support to help them truly excel . Just ask the star students who have been honored by USA TODAY over the past two decades for their high school success . <p> As our annual All-USA High School Academic Team enters its 20th year , we surveyed winners from the past 19 years to get their perspective on what made them successful . What we found is that excellence can flourish in a range of environments : <p> *Jonathan Gross , 1988 team , Killian High , Miami . Gross , along with brother Jason , a member of the 1990 team , grew up with parents who exposed their sons to museums and with a grandmother who loved to travel with her grandsons . <p> " I always remember from a very young age , both parents taking us seriously , treating us with no hint of condescension , " he says . " When we had ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they would have talked to an adult about something . " Gross , a graduate of Stanford Law School , is a senior director for Project GRAD USA , a non-profit organization aimed at raising academic achievement and college-going rates in low-income communities . <p> *Nancy Cho , 1994 , Walt Whitman High , Rockville , Md . A daughter of immigrants who worked long hours to provide their children with extra educational opportunities that had n't been available to them in Korea , Cho learned the value of hard work by her parents ' example . <p> " They made me realize it was important to pursue your goals , " says Cho , who spent summers as a teen working at the National Institutes of Health . " Working hard was n't something that was strange for me . " Cho , who married fellow team member Eric Sheu in May , is a medical resident at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston . <p> *Wil Carson , 1995 , Colony High , Palmer , Alaska . The son of two teachers who divorced and remarried other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught him to love learning . Although he was raised without a television set in a town with few large buildings , Carson grew up to make documentary films overseas and is now a Los Angeles architect . <p> In some ways , upbringings were as different as their geographic locations , but there were some powerful similarities : educated , committed parents , some wonderful teachers and mentors , high expectations and the opportunities to pursue their passions . <p> Though not every student with most or all of those elements will become an all-star student , the vast majority of former All-USA High School Academic First Team members had those advantages . <p> An early leg up <p> Because the academic team program honors high school achievement , winners by definition can be considered early bloomers . And for most , the seeds of their success were sown long before they started ninth grade . The survey results , based on 72% of the 378 winners responding , are telling in terms of their family lives : <p> *94% said they grew up in homes with both a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctorates , and 58% of their mothers had a master 's degree or doctorate . More than 95% of the fathers and 91% of the mothers had at least a bachelor 's degree , and 100% of the parents had at least a high school diploma . <p> *In 43% of the families , only one parent worked outside the home for the majority of the student 's school years . <p> Those findings would support a body of educational scholarship showing that factors such as parental educational attainment and household structure have a major impact on academic performance . <p> From Gross 's point of view , " If you win the genetic lottery and are born into a house with two highly educated , loving parents , your chances of educational and later success are almost assured . " <p> What 's most significant is the way parents live and demonstrate that they value education , Gross says . Though the country may be increasingly consumer driven , educational success is n't something you can simply purchase after consulting Consumer Reports . <p> " Why ca n't you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package that gets them into Yale ? It might work in deciding what car to buy , but it does n't work into how to raise kids , " Gross says . " It 's a long slog . " <p> In the survey , parental involvement/influence was rated " very important " to their high school success by 81% of the respondents  --  slightly more than " personal work ethic " ( 79% ) , " finding an activity I was passionate about " ( 77% ) and " a great teacher or mentor " ( 74% ) . <p> For many , those factors were not just very important but intrinsically intertwined . Parents and other mentors  --  as well as motivated peers  --  combined to broaden their minds , expose them to opportunities and possibilities , and raise their expectations . <p> For Carson , growing up among education professionals meant his intellectual growth was nurtured from a very young age . <p> " Human beings are innately curious , and if you can find something to be curious about , you can be motivated , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , both of them early childhood educators , were " hands-off specifically , hands-on generally " when it came to his educational pursuits , which ranged in high school from student government on a statewide level to research on the Exxon Valdez oil spill . " My parents were never prescriptive , and I appreciate that . " <p> As his parents were less involved as he got older , a series of teachers and professors became extremely important , he says . <p> At 35 , Zayd Eldadah , a member of the 1987 team from Rockville ( Md . ) High , appreciates his father 's emphasis on good habits  --  high ethics , focus , dedication and taking on challenges  --  far more than he did in high school . <p> But Eldadah , associate director of arrhythmia research for Washington Hospital Center , also credits a few truly memorable teachers , particularly journalism teacher Kevin Keegan , for helping shape who he has become . <p> As a sophomore , Eldadah got a handwritten note from Keegan inviting him to write for the school newspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his editing the arts magazine and joining the academic team Keegan advised . <p> Keegan not only helped him to broaden his academic knowledge beyond his favored math and science , but also influenced his character , Eldadah says . " He was so laser-focused on excellence and perfection . He instilled that in everyone he taught . " <p> Pressure and motivation <p> High expectations , of course , can have a hard edge . In the survey , 44% of the former First Team members said they felt " quite a lot of pressure " and 37% more felt " some pressure " to excel during their high school years . More than half  --  56%  --  said their family emphasized getting good grades " quite a lot . " <p> But at the same time , the survey suggests most of the high-achieving students channeled whatever pressure they may have felt into personal motivation : 84% said they , themselves , emphasized getting good grades " quite a lot . " <p> Like his wife , Nancy Cho , whom he met when they were named to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . Their emphasis was key when Sheu was in elementary school when he did n't think he could do well . <p> But doing well gave him confidence and raised his own expectations , which motivated him to continue to do well  --  from Dunwoody ( Ga . ) High to Harvard , a British Marshall Scholarship to Oxford and back to Harvard Medical School . <p> " I did well , so I felt like I had to keep doing well , " he says . <p> They may have had a lot of advantages , but ultimately , First Team members still had to work hard . In the survey , almost all said " personal work ethic " was very ( 79% ) or somewhat ( 18% ) important to their success . <p> " Work ethic is something that 's conferred by example . Kids are much smarter than we give them credit for ; it 's about what they see , " Gross says . <p> On the other hand , not every student whose parents care enough to emphasize hard work will absorb it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) parents still have to sit on the shoulder and crack the whip , they probably have n't developed the internal passion it takes to really be successful . <p> " I remember in the first grade , I got a report card that did n't reflect a whole lot of good work on my part , " Gross adds , conjuring up the memory with total clarity three decades later . " My parents let me know real early they expected me to apply myself in school . That was formative . " <p> Many recall parents who worked hard themselves and expected best efforts from their kids . Cho , for example , recalls even when she was very young , she was aware that her mother , a registered nurse , worked 16-hour days . " I can hardly remember my parents taking any vacation time . They were so focused on providing opportunities for their kids . " <p> Luck  --  and perseverance <p> Though at age 29 she better understands where her immigrant parents were coming from , Cho remembers times when she did n't particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high expectations . " I do n't know what would have happened if I had gotten Bs . " <p> Cho also drew on her experiences in music and sports in developing her work ethic . Luck plays a role , she acknowledges , but in the end , it 's the hard work that brings results . <p> " You learn to delay gratification , " she says . " You learn that practice and sweat are 90% of success .
