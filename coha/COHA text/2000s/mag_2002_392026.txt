Blake Burgess contemplates how he 's going to squeeze through that tiny passageway . Photograph // CRAWLING UNDERGROUND THROUGH  --  UGH !  --  MUD AND MORE GIVES THESE GUYS A TASTE OF BEING STUCK IN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE . C'm on Bobby ! " yelled one of the Scouts assembled by the exit hole of West Virginia 's Lawrence Cave . " You can make it ! " Below them , out of sight down in the dark cave , life Scout Bobby Steinbach slid and swayed , twisted and turned in the dark as he tried to climb the flimsy rope ladder . The rungs were slippery , caked with mud from the boots of his fellow climbers who had ascended before him . Under the best conditions , a rope ladder is one of the more challenging devices ever concieved by man . And these conditions were far from ideal . Bobby understood his problem : At 14 , he was already over six feet tall and weighed 250 pounds . Although large stature is a plus in sports like football and basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he proved , he would not be stopped . But it was climb the ladder or the rather embarrassing option : get pulled out on a rope . Bobby kept at it . Have Hard-Hat Headlamp , Will Crawl Most of these Scouts from Leonardtown , MD. , Troop 420 knew that the key to caving  --  the key to most things in life  --  was to keep at it . They had caving experience ; this was their sixth trip exploring the caverns of West Virginia . This most recent caving expedition began at 9 a.m. , after a big breakfast and after the Scouts had changed into coveralls and attached headlamps to their hard hats . Assistant Scoutmaster and caving expert Dan Slick set up a rope so the guys could rappel down into the cave , which from the surface looked like nothing more than a sinkhole in the ground . Life Scout Tony Matthews , a first  --  time caver , was the first Scout to descend . The rappel took him down 15 feet into a small dark cave . He switched on his light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out . " Through there , " said Scoutmaster Mark Duval , pointing his flashlight at a small opening partially blocked by a stone . After several tries , Tony squirmed through . He slid down a mud chute and entered the main cave . " I had a lot of trouble , " he said . " I had to go into the squeeze headfirst , and I did n't know where to put my legs when I got through . " Batting Around One by one the other Scouts , caving veterans by most accounts , rappelled into the black hole . They slipped through the opening and gathered in the main cave . " Lights out , " said one . Everybody turned off his headlamp . The result was absolute darkness and a ghostly silence . The silence was broken by the whoosh of wings . Startled , the Scouts quickly turned their lights back on . " It 's an Indian bat , " whispered one Scout , who recorded the sighting on a scientific form . Part of the Scouts ' mission underground was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scientist , came on the trip to help with thegathering ( and to cave with sons Josh and Danny ) . The Scouts knew the Indian bat was an endagered species . They also understood one reason for its decline : humans disturbing the bats during winter hibernation , causing them to burn off the precious fat they store to survive untill spring . That was why the Scouts came caving during the warm month , when the bats had plenty of insects for food . The boys could collect information without worry of harming the very critters they were trying to help . In the Belly of the Beast The Scouts headed deeper into the cave . Their headlamps illuminated eerie formations of creamy white flowstone draping the cave walls . This was where water had deposited minerals on the limestone bedrock . The guys straddled a narrow , deep canyon , left foot on one side , right foot on the other  --  and in between , a nasty drop down , down , down into ugly darkness . They duck-walked through lowceiling passageways . They slid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then after four hours of exploring Lawrence Cave , the Scouts faced the rope ladder . All made it up , though not without varying degrees of dificulty . And ther was Bobby Steinbach , bringing up the rear , twisting in the darkness . Got ta Get Out Rung by agonizing rung , Bobby desperately pulled himself up the ladder . Visions of being hauled to the surface kept him moving up the slippery , teisty stupid rope .

Photograph THE CAVES OF WEST VIRGINIA Both Lawrence Cave and Bowden ( the other cave expired by troop 420 on their trip ) are called limestone solution caves . Limestone is very strong mechanically . The Empire State Building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest building , has limestone in its walls . Limestone is composed of calcium carbonate , a chemical compound that is insoluble in pure water . However , it dissolves in acidified water As rainwater sinks into the ground it becomes acidic as it absorbs carbon dioxide . which is a byproduct of tile millions of micro-organisms living in the soil . When the acidic water meets limestone bedrock , as it does in the Seneca Rocks region of West Virginia , it carves out the caverns and sinkholes that cavers  --  and Scouts  --  find irresistible .

Then at long last , his head popped out of the hole . The waiting Scouts cheered and applauded . Bobby squeezed through the tiny cave opening and dragged himself up the steep sides of the crater that surrounded the hole . Exhausted , he collapsed to the ground .

Squinting into the bright sunlight , Charlie Collins tried to put the underground mess in perspective . " Caving 's a real adventure , " the muddy Star Scout said . " Sort of like rock climbing in the dark . " CAVING SAFETY Caving can be as safe as a walk in a park .  --  if you take the proper precautions . Of 46 caving accidents reported to the National Speleogical Society in 1999 , six were fatalities ( two of those happening during the very dangerous activity of scuba diving in underwater caves . ) The most common injuries : falls and strandings in caves because cavers got stuck in a squeeze , could not climb out of the cave or got lost . Following caving rules is critical . Caving expert and assistant Scoutmaster Dan Slick reccomends a minimum of four people on any caving expidition . ( Never , ever go caving alone ! ) Equally important is having the proper gear .
