// For the 20th anniversary of E.T. , the filmmakers and stars recall their incredible journey EVEN MONTHS AFTER IT OPENED IN THE SUMMER of 1982 , E.T . The Extra-Terrestrial outgrossed Star Wars to become the all-time box office champion . ( At least temporarily-its domestic gross came to about $400 million after all its rereleases , placing it fourth on the list . ) It seemed there was n't a corner of the country or the globe left unmoved by the fairy-tale story of Elliott , a bike-riding suburban kid who reunites an alien orphan with its mother ship . Speaking of reunions , as the 20th-anniversary edition opens in theaters , we 've asked the cast and crew to tell us how they launched E.T . into orbit . I. DESERT BRAINSTORM STEVEN SPIELBERG ( now 55 , director ) E.T began to happen around the time of Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 . I had one moment in the film where an extraterrestrial , whom we affectionately referred to as Puck , walks over to Franqois Truffaut and they make hand signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MELISSA MATHISON ( 51 , screenwriter , then-girlfriend and future wife of Harrison Ford ) The shoot for Raiders of the Lost Ark started in London in early 1980 . Steven asked me one day if I wanted to come up and see his E.T . ' s . I thought , What the hell is an E.T. ? He showed me these violent E.T . ' s-ferocious guys he was developing a movie about called Night Skies . SPIELBERG Rick Baker had designed alien creatures more like gremlins than like E.T . And we had a script by John Sayles before I pulled the plug on the whole endeavor and said , " This is not the story I want to tell . " MATHISON I was n't anyplace as a writer at that point . I had been thrown into writing on The Black Stallion and it worked . But screenwriting was n't really something I knew how to do . SPIELBERG Melissa was down on herself as a writer . And I kept reminding her what a brilliant job Black Stallion had been . I remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setups on Raiders , where I told her the story of E.T . And I think producer Kathy Kennedy , Harrison , and I got Melissa to agree to write it after a couple of days of resistance . MATHISON We were driving through the Sahara in the middle of the night . It was Steven and me and Harrison , talking about the boy and the family and E.T . It was dark and there was a moon . It was just one of those dreamy , Little Prince kind of moments . II WRITE OF PASSAGE MATHISON When Steven was editing Raiders , once a week I 'd take pages to him . We 'd work on 3-by-5 cards and look at our outline . SPIELBERG I said , " E.T . should be young . " Melissa said , " No , I think he 's old . " I compromised by saying " Let 's make him 600 years old out of a possible life span of 20,000 years . " MATHISON I remember typing scenes where E.T . is getting sick .... This was December 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of the year .... Harrison was watching TV in the den across from the bedroom where I was working , and I heard , " Beatle shot ! " Like a teaser . I remember saying to Harrison , " Oh , I hope it 's not John . " And then it was John . A horrible moment . I remember just sitting there for hours and then going back to the typewriter . I had to because I was a week from deadline . That 's when I started the part with E.T . dying . CAROL LITTLETON ( film editor ) It was a beautiful script . These children really seemed to be siblings . And there was such a solidarity between them for a broken home . The kids really understood each other 's problems and stuck together . That 's what struck me-it 's not a fabricated TV family . SPIELBERG I did n't think anybody was going to see E.T . except kids . Certainly Columbia Pictures felt that way . They put it in turnaround . So I brought it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the production money , but I told him , " I do n't want to make this movie for over $10 million . " II . WANTED : CHILDREN OF ALL AGES DEE WALLACE STONE ( 52 , cast as Mary , the mom ) I 've heard Steven say the reason he cast me was , he never considered me an adult . In a way he was right . Even in my early 30s , I was an extremely naive , Midwestern Cornhusker girl . ROBERT MacNAUGHTON ( 35 , cast as Michael , the older brother ) My first meeting with Steven was the day Reagan was shot , so I remember there was a lot of activity and people giving Steven updates on what was happening . I was real keyed up because I worshiped Close Encounters . A lot of auditions I 've been on , I felt I was being scrutinized . With him I did n't get that . SPIELBERG I 'd seen a number of 6-year-olds for Gertie 's role . When Drew Barrymore came in , she wiped my memory clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar . Perfect qualities in a child actor . DREW BARRYMORE ( 27 , cast as Gertie , the youngest child ) I would tell these big elaborate stories about how I was the drummer in a punk band and we were going on tour . He really enjoyed it . All of them-Steven , Kathleen , Melissa-were truly interested . When you 're a kid , a lot of adults shove you off , " Yeah , kid , whatever . " They did n't . I ca n't tell you how wonderful that was . // E.T . BY THE NUMBERS // E.T . BY THE NUMBERS Photograph CREATURE COMFORTS ( 1 ) E.T . discovers potato salad and ( 2 ) comes out of the closet to Barrymore and Thomas . ( 3 ) Coyote and Wallace Stone confer as Thomas looks on . ( 4 ) Thomas , Barrymore , and MacNaughton are awestruck. ( 5 ) E.T. , with Thomas , prepare to go back home . // MIKE FENTON ( casting director ) We lost our first choice for Elliott , a boy in Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allowed to see the script . And this boy 's mother , who was his manager , said , " Gee , since you wo n't give us anything to read , I 'm going to have my son do an ABC pilot . " And of course , he 's never been heard from again . KATHLEEN KENNEDY ( 48 , producer ) Jack Fisk Sissy Spacek 's husband , who was making his directorial debut on Raggedy Man had his cutting room next to our offices on the old MGM lot . I 'd gotten to know his editor and we got to talking about how we 'd been frustrated looking for the boy for E.T . And he offhandedly said to me , " We have an extraordinary child in this movie . " FENTON We attempted to test Henry Thomas with script pages . Then Steven sent Henry to a room to play videogames and told me to improvise a scene , to tell Henry I was going to do experiments on EX So we bring Henry back , and I say , " Elliott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.T . to Washington . " Henry 's eyes got enormous and he started to cry . KENNEDY He had us all in tears . When you watch the audition tape you hear people saying " Stop ! This is going on too long ! We 're all a wreck ! " // E.T . BY THE NUMBERS Photograph DIRECT EFFECT ( 1 ) " Suddenly , " says Spielberg of Barrymore , " we were writing lines specifically for her " ; ( 2 ) he gives E.T . and earful // HENRY THOMAS ( 30 , east as Elliett ) I do n't think it 's a particularly great audition tape . It 's kind of hard for me to sit through , actually . It 's embarrassing . SPIELBERG I cast him right there . Sometimes that 's the greatest way a director can be Santa Claus . There 's nothing better than the expression on someone 's face when you can say , unconditionally , " You have the job . " IV . DOCTORS IN THE HOUSE TOMAS The film was constantly changing . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rehearsal was with Melissa . I would sit with her in the morning and we 'd go over what she had rewritten . BARRYMORE Steven would ask , " What do you want to say here ? " He let us come up with our own stuff a lot . WALLACE STORE Steven would run the camera and throw the children lines . He would say , " Okay , now , Drew , say the line like this but take a bite of hamburger first . " He would catch us off guard . I do n't think Henry ever saw E.T . with all the doctors until they were just about to shoot that scene . MacNAUGHTON A lot of them were real emergency-room doctors . It was impressive to watch them treat E.T . dying like a real code blue . Drew was really upset . It was n't hard to be emotional watching that , ' cause it was so real . SPIELBERG Herb Stein , my internist in the ' ' 80s , he 's in there . Other doctors I got from some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you write all that medical dialogue ? " I said , " No , are you kidding ? " I started to write it , but then we thought , Hell , let 's let them do it . They were so into it-all like little movie stars . V. TURN ON THAT HEARTLIGHT MacNAUGHTON This incredible , exuberant kid , Matthew De Merritt , did the most athletic scenes with the E.T . suits . He was born without legs . He 'd go around on a skateboard . He 's just a great guy , fun to be around . WALLACE STONE The scene in the kitchen , when I 'm putting away the groceries and E.T . is walking around behind me , was done by the little boy Matthew . He was turned upside down in the suit , walking on his hands . MacNAUGNTON Pat Bilon was the main little person inside E.T . He died shortly after filming . But he certainly enjoyed life . Every weekend he 'd fly to Vegas . He was funny-quite the guy . THOMAS It was easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed . I could imagine that thing being alive . On the E.T . suits , the eyes looked ridiculously fake . When you 're looking at a little plastic head on a dwarf , and you can hear somebody breathing inside and cursing , it 's a little bit more difficult to believe . BARRYMORE Steven was always very protective of us not seeing too much of the mechanics . On some intelligent level-as intelligent as you can be at 6-I knew this was not real . But I treated E.T . like he was alive and had a soul . I brought him lunch . I 'd put covers around him if I thought he was cold . WALLACE STONE There was this subplot about E.T . having this infatuation with Mary . He comes into my room at night after I 'm asleep and lays some Reese 's Pieces as a little present on my bedstand . ALLEN DAVIAU ( cinematographer ) As I recall , E.T . comes in wearing a checkered sport jacket , and Dee 's asleep under the sheet . WALLACE STONE Steven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a lot lower than I wanted it . MATHISON That was hysterical in the dailies . Steven had her be half-naked ! She had to take her top off . It was the most bizarre scene . It was like E.T . the voyeur . Dee is lying there facedown , and E.T . like pulls the sheet off of her and he 's going " Hunnnh , hunnnh , hunnnh . " I certainly had nothing to do with this scene . This was a boys ' moment . We could n't use it . VI . NEVER ACT WITH CHILDREN OR ALIENS SPIELBERG What helped the kids emotionally is I shot the film in continuity ... as much as possible . They understood every second where they were , because yesterday actually happened yesterday , and tomorrow was going to happen the next day . So their emotions built as the story progressed and became more semitragic . Photograph ALIEN NOTION ( 1 , 2 ) " I 'd talk to him and knew he 'd never tell my secrets , " says Barrymore . " I believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // DAVIAU We shot it in 61 days . People find that hard to believe . MATHISON There were days when the kids , bless their hearts , were not emoting . And that was always hard on everybody . Because you ca n't get mad at them . THOMAS I remember being utterly scared throughout most of the production . Not because they were vile , harsh taskmasters or anything . It was just a tremendous amount of responsibility . Whether they ever said it or not , I felt it . I knew that most of the film was riding on my performance . PETER COYOTE ( 59 , cast as Keys , the kindly government agent ) What a pressure for a 9- or 10-year-old ! It did n't show . To me , anyway . THOMAS If I told somebody I was scared , I was sure they 'd fire me and the acting police would come take me away . In a robot voice " He 's expressing doubts ! Delete him ! Eradicate him ! " MacNAUGHTON Everybody under 18 could only work four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of school , an hour of lunch . So for the adults there was a lot of waiting around . WALLACE STONE Actors are like racehorses . Pick us up , transport us to the track , groom us , and we 're ready to race . If we do n't get out of the gate , we wan na break the place down . We go nutty . There was one point where I literally went to the set every single day and did n't work for three weeks . I learned to meditate . And I made the largest needlepoint pillow anybody has ever seen . VII . WHAT DOES AN ALIEN SOUND LIKE ? SPIELBERG Debra Winger was my friend , and I always loved her smoky voice . One day when she was visiting me on the set , I said , " Hey , can you come into the trailer ? I 'll bring a tape recorder in . Will you open the script and do every single E.T . line for my temporary sound track ? " She said , " Great ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the first 20 or 30 people who ever saw E.T heard her voice in the rough cut . WALLACE STONE Well , now you 've really thrown me for a loop , because I thought Debra Winger did the final voice . BEN BURTT ( Oscar winner , with Charles L. Campbell , for E.T . ' s sound effects editing ) Some of the breathing sounds Debra Winger made wound up in the film . There were 18 different sound sources altogether , some people and some animals , from otters to raccoons . But the woman who provided E.T . ' s words was Pat Welsh . I found her in line at a camera store . She had this deep , resonant sort of monotonic voice . She was the wife of a retired Marin County banker , in her mid- to late 60s . She 'd chain-smoked since the 1930s , and sadly enough , that was the reason her voice was that way . I cornered her on the sidewalk and basically said , " Would you like to be an alien in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIFTOFF " MATHISON There was a preview screening in Houston . It was all of us going down , including Universal people . In those days , you got on a regular plane . KENNEDY Until that preview , we were n't going to have a particularly wide release . E.T . was being compared to a Disney film , which at the time was not great . MATHISON I 'd never seen anything like the emotional reaction that audience had . Whole families , laughing and sobbing and hugging . To see it the first time-the euphoria ! There was this true endorphin rush . SPIELBERG When that audience responded the way they did for 1 hour and 52 minutes , I considered retiring . The vocal reaction was unprecedented in my experience , including Jaws . MATHISON I was sitting next to Steven . He kept alternately squeezing and pounding on my thigh . It hurt . SPIELBERG The most remarkable thing was the preview cards . E. T. had 98 percent in the top box , " Excellent , " and 2 percent in " Very Good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or " Poor . " MATHISON We went to a Mexican restaurant after . Nobody had eaten , and I do n't drink . Two margaritas and I was literally on the floor of the bathroom . Kathy Kennedy was hiding me in there till Universal chief Sid Sheinberg left . SPIELBERG I watched Melissa celebrate in a way I 've only seen character actors celebrate in John Ford films . She got drunk as a skunk . MATHISON On the ride back to the hotel , I was sitting by the window vomiting out of it . Steven had his arm around me . He kept saying " Melissa , just promise me you 'll never forget this night . " And I 'm going " Brwaaaaaa " out the window . He was just so worried that it would all become a big blur to me . IX . BIGGER THAN STAR WARS SPIELBERG There were box office reports in The Wall Street Journal , not just the trades . The nightly news shows on all three networks were running stories for what seemed like weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumped us off the cover for the Falkland Islands war . I say this with all humility : Which do you really remember , the Falkland war , or E.T. ? COYOTE My character was named Keys in the script because that 's all you see of him at first . For the whole first half of the movie , you saw me from the crotch down . I got a postcard from an old girlfriend . It said , " Went to see E.T . Recognized you the minute you came on screen . " Photograph THE E.T . TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY WE ALL KNOW ABOUT E.T . ' S SMASH DEBUT , BUT what of the torrid ups and downs the alien experienced throughout the rest of his career ? here we take you behing the ... uh ... big rubbery head. - Josh Wolk 1977 In his first big break , a young E.T . is cast in The Empire Strikes Back as Yoda 's nosy landlord , Phil . Unfortunately , his " I know you got a Jedi In there ! " shtick wears on test audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire heartbreak pays off when a penitent George Lucas recommends E.T . to Steven Spielberg , who is wowed and signs him up for the lead in E.T. , replacing original choice Tina Yothers. 1985 Steve Van Zandt requests that E.T . appear for free alongside Bruce Springsteen and Bono in star-studded " Sun City " video , complete with lit-up heart . E.T . develops reputation as prima donna with his terse reply , " No dough , no glow . " 1986 The increasingly attitudinal alien agrees to star in TV 's ALF , but walks off the set on the first day of shooting , unhappy about the size of his dressing room . " Maybe this crap flies with the cast of V , " he screams , " but I did n't gross $300 million to sit in a godd  --  shoebox !

" When Peter and I get back together , " he jokes to Byron Allen , " you know it 'll ... be good ! " // WALLACE STONE I do n't remember any firestorm in my life . I got a great television series called Together We Stand with Elliott Gould . And it did a lot of stuff for my career ... a lot of movies-of-the-week and people knew who I was and it upped my price . I think I did take a blowout trip to Hawaii . But I did n't make a whole lot of money on E.T . COYOTE I was out of work for nine months after E.T opened .... But I was not the star . The stars are arguably the kids and E.T . and Steven . Steven Spielberg is the star of most Steven Spielberg movies . SPIELBERG It was the most incredible year of my life . It was the second time I 'd been involved in a cultural phenomenon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit from E.T. , because it was just so overwhelming . I threw myself into ... preproduction on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom in Sri Lanka , basically as a way of escaping all the good news . BARRYMORE It was up to me afterwards to destroy it or make it great , and I did both . I would n't be where I am now if it was n't for E.T . THOMAS There is always a certain part of you that strives for recognition , some ego thing . But no matter how much you entertain the idea of being famous , I do n't think you can ever really be prepared for it . It 's never how you imagined it . MacNAUGHTON Henry had some craziness right after where people were following him . A lady nearly attacked him in the supermarket . THOMAS That happened quite a bit . I could go on and on about unsettling stories of strange fans and bad situations . MacNAUGHTON I started to lose the joy of the work after E.T. . It was getting to be discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to do . I never dreamed I would be completely out of the business by my 30s . I do n't get recognized a lot now . When I do , it 's people who think they went to school with me . COYOTE It 's fun to have been in a classic . The fear you have is that that 'll be the only thing in the parentheses after your name . BARRYMORE When I go into Steven 's office , he has my drawings up on his wall from when I was a kid . I do n't have a dad that has my stuff on his wall . Steven is that person for me . He was the first consistent , trustworthy , supportive male I ever had in life . He did n't look at that like something scary or a burden . SPIELBERG E.T . is a product of who I was in 1981 , and AL and Minority Report are a reflection of who I am today . I 've gone into a darker period in my life . Not because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my antenna is a lot more tuned in to the way the world works . I think I know too much now to be able to tell stories like E.T . in the same ways . There 's much more to read about the making of E.T . The Extra-Terrestrial . Pleas go to ew.com/et . Photograph THE CORRECTIONS DOES E.T . NOW PHONE HOME ON A CELLULAR , LEAVING PAL Elliott with massive roaming charges ? Not quite , but viewers who know E.T . The Extra-Terrestrial by bright , flashing heart will notice that some subtle changes have been made in the new , 20th-anniversary edition. - SD WHAT 'S ADDED ? A total of two and a half minutes of footage . Back in 1981 , Steven Spielberg shot two minutes of E.T . and Elliott playing in the bathroom ( above ) , but scrapped it since puppeteering limitations left the scene looking fake . Says visual  --  effects supervisor Bill George , who helped fix the problem , " I never saw the original footage ... but I heard that when he came out of the tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Now the scene 's back in with a nonporous , computer-generated ET . replacing the polyurethane one in most shots . A shorter restored scene shows Elliott 's mom , Mary , searching for him on Halloween . Do n't blink or you 'll miss the kid in a Richard Nixon mask . WHAT 'S UPGRADED ? The sound 's remastered . Shots in which the mechanical E.T . seemed wobbly or inexpressive have been replaced with a more articulated digital version ( sometimes the whole body 's new , sometimes just the head or eyes ) . You may notice prominent fixes as E.T . runs through the forest ( he lopes like a gorilla instead of sliding like a car on a track ) , has a screaming jag in Elliott 's room , and guzzles beer in the kitchen . The spaceship looks shinier , too , and parts of the flying-bicycle scenes were reshot with actor doubles supplanting teeny figurines . WHAT 'S OUT ? Spielberg says becoming a father in the mid- ' ' 80s left him " bothered " that he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pistols have been replaced with walkie-talkies , and one close-up of a shotgun has been removed , along with the line " No guns-they 're children ! " Also , In the original , Mary yells at son Michael that he 's not allowed out on Halloween dressed like a " terrorist . " In the new version , he 's not allowed out like a " hippie . " Says screenwriter Melissa Mathison , who was n't involved in the change : " That does n't make sense . The mom is a hippie , for God 's sake . " Purists can relax : Spielberg says the DVD release will include both the old and new cuts of the film . // <p>
