Chapter One Heading for the Blade Judd Thompson Jr . said a quick prayer and wondered if it would be his last . He glanced at Tom Gowin , the young believer from South Carolina who lay on the dusty floor , his head turned , a trickle of blood running from his mouth . Lionel Washington was beside Judd , his hands also cuffed behind him . Lionel was near tears , his head down , sweat pouring from his forehead . Judd wondered where they had made their mistake . Were they wrong to come to South Carolina ? Chang Wong kept up with developments around the world . Surely he knew the danger they faced . " Keep your head up , " Judd whispered to Lionel . Someone slapped Judd on the back of the head . " Shut up ! " Albert yelled , pushing Judd hard . " Get in the next room . " The bounty hunters herded Judd and Lionel into the living room of the tiny house and shoved them onto a shabby couch by the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max , took out a cigarette and lit it . Judd noticed Nicks littering the kitchen table , payment for bringing in two bodies without the mark of Carpathia . Max threw a leather pouch at Albert . " Put the money in there . We do n't want anybody wiping us out while we 're gone . " " You know there 's nobody out here- , " Albert began . " Just do it , " Max said , opening the door . " Where you going ? " " The truck needs fuel . " He glanced at Judd and Lionel . " And make sure the other one 's still alive . If he is n't , we 'll load them all up and take them to the GC . " The door slammed behind Max , and the truck chugged to a small outbuilding . Judd watched through a side window as Max unlocked a creaky door . Empty metal cans crashed until the man found one with gasoline . Albert grabbed Nicks from the table and floor and stuffed them into the pouch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Lionel a look . Albert smiled as he flitted about the room gathering money , humming an off-key version of a country song . " We 're going to do a little celebratin ' tonight ! After we turn you in and find that other nest of Judah-ites , we 'll have enough money to move out of here and get a place near the city where the real money is . " Judd bit his lip . The pain from being shot by the weird weapon and having his hands cuffed tightly behind him had dulled his senses . It was difficult to breathe , let alone think clearly . His shoulder muscles ached as he shifted on the rickety couch . " Too bad you and your friend are settling for chicken feed , " Lionel said . " Shut up , " Albert said . " Up in Atlanta , there 's probably thousands of people without the mark . We could lead you to them . " The man grinned . " You ai n't from Atlanta . I can tell you 're from up north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we 're from , " Lionel said . " Is n't an unmarked Northerner worth just as much ? " Albert rolled his eyes . " Max says the GC is real interested in you two . They might pay us more than the regular rate . " Lionel glanced at Judd and leaned toward him , then whispered , " You think Tom 's still alive ? His head hit pretty hard on the floor . " Judd shrugged and the truck started up again , a plume of blue smoke rising from the tailpipe . Max pulled up to the house and ran inside . Albert handed him the bulging pouch of money . " He kept some of it , " Judd said . Albert backhanded Judd 's face . Judd tasted blood in his mouth . " Judah-ites , " Albert sneered . " He 's just trying to get us to turn against each other . " " Look in his pockets , " Judd said . Another hard blow , a kick this time , sent Judd reeling . The couch crackled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure they would have toppled . " He took some of the money ! " Judd yelled . Max glared at his partner . " It had better all be here . " " I might have picked up a few Nicks by mistake ... " Max frowned at Albert who held out his hand . " I swear it was a mistake . " He dug into his pockets , emptying the contents on the table . Max grabbed the Nicks and shoved them into the pouch . " I 'm going to count this . If it 's short- " " Lemme look , " Albert said , fishing in his pockets . Judd saw movement to his right . Someone peered through the crack in the door where Tom was being held . Judd studied the face- a young man , a little older than Judd . Brown hair . Luke ? The man made a signal Judd could n't understand , then mouthed , " Stay there . " Judd nodded and whispered to Lionel . When Judd glanced back , the door was closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Check on the other kid and make sure he 's alive . " " Wait , " Judd said , trying to stand . " You shut up , " Albert said , kicking Judd in the stomach and sending him back onto the couch . Judd tried to stall the man , but he went straight for the door . He jiggled the handle several times . " How did this get locked ? " Max squinted . " Out of the way ! " With one kick , the door cracked and flew open . Max and Albert disappeared into the room , and both let out a string of curses . " The window ! " Albert yelled . " He got out through the window ! " * * * Vicki Byrne closed her eyes and tried to calm herself . The e-mail from Chang Wong in New Babylon was the worst news she could imagine . Bounty hunters in the South were looking for anyone without the mark of Carpathia . Judd and Lionel had walked into a trap . Mark turned the speakerphone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked for the Global Community in Florida and now lived in South Carolina . " Tom and Luke headed for the fort hours ago , " Carl said . " That 's where they were supposed to meet Judd and Lionel . " " Have you had any contact with Tom and Luke ? " Vicki said . " We talked by radio several times . They saw Judd and Lionel 's plane and even spotted them rowing across the river . They were going to meet them when we lost contact . I thought they had just gone out of range , but maybe they were caught . " " How far from the meeting place are you right now ? " Mark said . " It 's a hike . We 're a long way up the river on an old plantation . " " Those bounty hunters could be coming to you next , " Vicki said . " We do n't see many people up here , " Carl said . " We 've taken a lot of precautions since our other hideout was discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any news , and Mark hung up . An eerie silence fell over the group . Finally , Zeke said , " I think we ought to pray . " The kids prayed for Judd , Lionel , Tom , and Luke . Vicki wiped away tears . A few minutes into the session , she got up and went outside . Zeke joined her under one of the awnings the group had constructed between cabins . " I know you 're upset , but you ca n't give up hope . " " I have to do something . The GC is making all the moves . It 's like we 're trapped . " " You know how long it would take you to get to South Carolina from here ? The best thing you can do is pray . " " I do n't want to pray . I want to do something ! " Vicki sobbed . Zeke nodded , his long hair swishing against his chubby shoulders . " I know exactly how you feel . When the GC picked up my dad , I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . You know how hard it is to know someone you love 's going to die ? " Vicki could n't speak . Zeke put a hand on her shoulder . " Dad was ready , and Judd and Lionel are too . " " Do n't talk like that ! Judd 's coming back , and I 'm going to help him ! " Vicki ran inside the building . " I 'm sorry to interrupt , but I need a vehicle . " Marshall Jameson stood . " Vicki , you ca n't be serious . " " I have to help them . " Shelly hugged Vicki and they both cried . Mark ran a hand through his hair . " Vicki , this is insane . " She turned to Zeke . " Is n't there a part of you that wishes you had tried to save your dad ? Do n't you ever wonder if you might have been able to help him ? " Zeke just stared at her . Colin Dial stepped forward . " If this program that Commander Fulcire created goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If everyone knows they can make money finding people without the mark of Carpathia , we 'll be a prime target . " " The program has n't started up here , " Vicki said . " Besides , I 'll stick to back roads- " Becky Dial put a hand on Vicki 's shoulder . " I know how upset you are , but Colin 's right . You ca n't go anywhere right now . We have to trust God . " " He helped you by sending that angel Anak , " Charlie said . " Maybe God will send an angel to Judd . " Vicki looked from face to face , sensing their concern . Everyone in the room wanted Judd and Lionel to return safely . " I 'm going to my cabin , " Vicki said . " Call me the moment you hear anything . " Vicki raced away , wiping tears from her face . She collapsed on her bunk and sobbed , crying out to God . * * * Judd caught his breath as the two men in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled to his feet and moved toward the kitchen . " What are you doing ? " Judd said . Lionel turned and felt along the tabletop . His eyes lit and he scampered back to the couch . With his hands still cuffed behind him , he held out his pocketknife . " He took this and some clips from me earlier . " He sat on the couch , leaning forward , trying to open the small blade . Max returned and Lionel sat back , hiding the knife in his palm . " Get these two into the back of the truck , " Max said , glaring at Judd and Lionel . " And switch your gun to kill . No more trying to be nice to these kids . " Albert hustled Lionel and Judd into the back of the truck and closed the tailgate . Max had fastened plywood over the broken window , and it was dark inside . " You try to get away and it 'll be the last time , " Albert said . The plastic cuffs were tight around Judd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feeling in his hands . Lionel told Judd to scoot close . He pricked Judd 's arm once with the blade , and Judd helped guide the knife to the plastic strip . Lionel pulled the blade back and forth along the plastic . With the sawing motion they hoped to cut a notch into the thick plastic . " Good thing they did n't have the metal cuffs or there would be no way we 'd get them off , " Lionel said . " You think the guy you saw was Luke ? " " I 've never seen him before , but I ca n't imagine who else it would be . " Judd held still as Lionel worked . Max and Albert had n't returned , and Judd wondered if they had followed Tom into the woods . After a few minutes , Lionel pulled the knife away , and Judd managed to get his little finger to the middle of the cuffs . " I do n't feel any notch at all , " Judd said . " It 's not working . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me try that . " Judd helped guide the blade again , but this time the edge cut his arm and he yelped . " Sorry , man , " Lionel said . Minutes later the bounty hunters returned , and Judd heard the clatter of a weapon in the front seat . " You know I do n't do well at that place , " Albert whined . " It 's not like there 's a bunch of gators down there , " Max said . " Just take these two and have them processed . I 'll stay here and wait on the dogs so we can find the other one . " " Max , let me stay . " Max spoke through clenched teeth . " Go . I 'll find the other one . " The door closed and the truck started . Lionel kept working on the cuffs as they bounced along the bumpy road . " You ever think it would end this way ? " Lionel said . " Guess you wo n't get to see Vicki again . " " Concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but getting free . Now , as Albert drove along the deeply rutted road , Judd thought of Vicki . Unless Tom got back to his group and told the story , no one would know about Judd 's and Lionel 's fate . Is this God 's plan ? Judd thought . How could this possibly glorify God ? Years before , Bruce Barnes had said , " Pray as if everything depends on God , but work as if everything depends on you . " Lionel stopped for a moment and worked out a cramp in his hand . " Feel it and see if we 're making any progress . " Judd ran a little finger around the plastic , feeling for a notch . Lionel had been working the new blade long enough to get a cramp , but Judd 's heart sank when the surface was completely smooth . ( Continues ... )
