<p> ARVADA - Clare Booth Luce 's campy comedy classic ' The Women ' is populated by a bevy of backstabbing , man-stealing society snobs . <p> But at the Arvada Center , the only stealing by the women of ' The Women ' has been of scenes , and stabbing has been limited to the repeated jabbing of darning needles into fabric . <p> ' It 's hilarious - everyone is teaching one another knitting and crochet , ' said actress Gabriella Cavallero , who plays Miss For- <p> dyce . ' Everyone has been good and professional and supportive . ' <p> How do you like that ? It 's naughty a they 're nice . <p> Director Rod Lansberry 's new production , opening today , represents an unprecedented gathering of 30 of the area 's best-known and best-loved actresses . They hail from 18 theater companies , including the Denver Center , Avenue , Germinal Stage Denver and Country Dinner Playhouse . <p> Perhaps never before in local theater history has any one production brought together such a massive and eclectic collection of distaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' someone from just about everywhere . ' <p> The list , ranging in age from 12 to 76 , includes young Ashley Dean , who played the title role in the Walden Family Playhouse 's ' Heidi ' ; Patty Mintz Figel , who just conquered Edward Albee in Germinal 's ' Three Tall Women ' ; Melissa Swift-Sawyer , who starred in the longest-running show in Denver history , ' Always a Patsy Cline ' at the Galleria Theatre ; and Susan Dawn Carson , who recently moved to the Colorado Springs area after appearing in Broadway productions of ' Sunset Boulevard ' and ' Les Miserables . ' <p> The DCTC is represented by Cavallero , Leslie O'Carroll and Mercedes Perez . Lansberry also had the guts to cast award-winning actress Lucy Roucis , who frequently stars for the Physically Handicapped Amateur Musical Actors League ( PHAMALy ) but has found it nearly impossible to get work elsewhere because of her advanced Parkinson 's disease . <p> Landmark production <p> Luce 's catty dames spend their days dishing gossip in a beauty salon , but this Arvada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benevolent confluences of time and talent that will have a positive ripple effect on future plays for years to come . <p> That 's because many of the actors are directors themselves , including Billie McBride ( Theatre Group 's ' Last Summer at Bluefish Cove ' ) , Joan Staples ( Arvada Center 's ' The Dinner Party ' ) , Edith Weiss ( The Bug 's ' Casey at the Bat ' ) , Cavallero ( Creede Repertory Theatre 's ' The Memory of Water ' ) and the cast 's eldest stateswoman , Liz Jury ( Aurora Fox 's ' A Christmas Carol ' ) . <p> And every woman in the cast , said Amie MacKenzie , who plays the bitchy role of Chrystal Allen made famous by Joan Crawford in the 1939 film adaptation , knows this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , both in theater and in life . Connections are being made , and the seeds of future casting decisions are being planted . <p> ' I have no doubt of that , because this is a group of women who make things happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the list of women who direct or run their own companies or even their own businesses , it 's a powerhouse . I can definitely see two years from now , some play somewhere manifesting itself because of conversations that took place in the dressing rooms here . ' <p> And to think that 240 local actresses showed up to audition . <p> ' That tells me the talent pool in the Denver theater community is more amazing than people have ever recognized , ' Lansberry said . <p> The latest version <p> ' The Women ' began as , and remains , a cameo-filled star vehicle . The original included Arlene Francis ( ' To Tell The Truth ' ) and Doris Day in her first and last Broadway performance . The 1939 movie featured Crawford , Norma Shearer and Rosalind Russell . A 1973 revival included Kim Hunter and Myrna Loy , and another in 2001 had Jennifer Coolidge , Rue McClanahan , Cynthia Nixon and Jennifer Tilly . <p> " The Women ' is one of those shows I have wanted to do for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Theater of the 1930s was a golden age when the casts were huge . And the idea of putting that many women together in one piece held its own attraction , but I did n't want to do it with a cast of 12 where everyone had to play six roles . ' <p> Despite its sure-fire audience appeal , that attraction still makes for an expensive proposition . As a union theater , the Arvada Center is required to cast at least half its roles with Equity actresses . The theater company has struggled financially in recent years , but Lansberry was able to pull it off by hiring entirely from the Denver area . <p> ' From the very beginning , I knew we had the women here . I was never afraid of that , ' he said . ' And that made it easier from a budgetary point of view . But my hope all along was that an all-local cast would make the production an event in itself . ' <p> That it has , but there are still those who would look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic egos and wonder , ' What were you thinking ? ' <p> ' I was worried about that , to be honest , ' Lansberry said . ' I thought I was up for the challenge of bringing this many performers together , but you just do n't know . I thought it was going to be a struggle . ' <p> Cavallero , who has been a member of the DCTC since 1989 , admits she was worried , too . <p> ' I did not know most of the women in the cast coming in , and I thought that it would either be fantastic or hell , ' she said . Instead , everything clicked , rather than cliqued . <p> ' I just felt immediately loved , and I trusted everyone , ' she said . <p> Bonding over champagne <p> MacKenzie said there has been ' a complete absence of ego from day one . These are really established women with great confidence . They know who they are . They are not threatened , and they are not threatening . ' <p> She credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Keuhn threw , complete with period costumes , tea-party sandwiches a and lots of champagne . <p> ' I knew I needed to bring the group together and get a bond started , ' Lansberry said . ' Even though there are 30 women in the show , they never appear together until the curtain call . <p> ' So I said , let 's get everyone together and be a little decadent . Drinking champagne at 2 o'clock in the afternoon was part of that era . Let them have that bit of luxury . It was a nice little get-together a and it did n't hurt to have it a little lubricated . ' <p> MacKenzie said the party ' was the essence of what this entire experience has been about . Women today work , but here we get to sit back and talk about nails and knitting . We get to do girly things . And that 's so not any of us , which is why it 's so fun . ' <p> Cavallero called the experience ' a gift . ' Young actresses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other mothers to talk with about their kids and the entire cast has benefited from working with Roucis and understanding what living with Parkinson 's is all about . <p> ' Really , this has been the easiest , most enjoyable experience I 've ever had , ' Lansberry said . Which made MacKenzie ask jokingly if there were n't another reason for that . <p> ' So Rod , is it really so magical because we are all such amazing women , ' she teased , ' a Or is it because there are no men around to fight over ? ' <p> Actually , there are four men - the poor guys who work on the crew . They have to fend for themselves backstage , because the women have taken over both the men 's and women 's dressing rooms . So what exactly is their purpose ? <p> ' Brrrrrreakfast ! ' MacKenzie demanded with a roll of the tongue and a Crawford-like snap of her finger . <p> Finally , a sign the real women of ' The Women ' have arrived .
