Section : THE WORLD SERIES <p> The Marlins ' thumping of the Yankees in the World Series was no upset , given how well Florida played in October <p> When Derek Jeter led off for the Yankees in Game 6 of the 99th World Series , he figured hard-throwing Josh Beckett would start him with a fastball . He was right . Beckett 's 95-mph heater roared waist-high down the middle of the plate , and Jeter smashed it - foul down the third base line . A harmless Strike 1 . Two pitches later , Jeter was shaking his head on his way back to the dugout , a victim of a curve called Strike 3 . <p> The Marlins ' best had beaten the Yankees ' best . Jeter , the man who is as much about October as fun-size candy bars , the man who had all three of his team 's hits off Beckett in Game 3 , the man who never fails this time of year , had failed . This was not going to be Jeter 's night . This was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of last Saturday night in the Bronx , Jeter was retreating silently to the clubhouse , and Beckett was carted off the Yankee Stadium infield on the shoulders of his delirious teammates . <p> The Marlins had won the World Series . The Yankees had not for the third straight year . The team led by a 72-year-old manager brought out of retirement in May , the team that lost seven of its first 10 games under that manager , the team that went ignored even by its own fans until a few weeks ago , is your 2003 major league champion . The 11-year-old Marlins , still looking for their first division title , have had two winning seasons , and both of them have ended with champagne celebrations in late October . <p> Surprised ? Well , for much of America , about the only image more stunning than seeing the Marlins party inside storied Yankee Stadium would be one of George Steinbrenner smiling after the defeat . But you know what ? We should have seen this Fish tale coming . <p> Look at baseball 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode the momentum created by a Rally Monkey and a topnotch bullpen to their first world title . Two years ago , the Diamondbacks parlayed two aces into a championship in only their fourth year of existence . The best teams make it to the postseason , but they do n't always win it . Ask the 2001 Mariners , or the 2002 A 's , or the 2003 Braves . <p> More important , look at this year . The Marlins played as well as anyone - at least for the final five months of the season . They started a disappointing 19-29 - maybe the key to winning the World Series is starting slowly ; remember the Angels began 6-14 last year - but then played the rest of the season 30 games over .500 ( the Yankees were 29 games over during the same period ) . Because Marlins ownership believed its team had postseason potential , it fired manager Jeff Torborg with a 16-22 record in early May . On came McKeon and the fairy tale ensued . " But what gets lost in this Cinderella story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " You do n't sneak in the back door all the way to the World Series . " <p> Hiring the irrepressible McKeon went a long way toward turning the team around , even if the ridicule that immediately followed could be heard everywhere except in the Marlins ' front office . McKeon , who was fired as manager of the Reds in 2000 , comes across as a somewhat goofy senior citizen who wants nothing more out of life than a good time and plenty of cigars . He tries to be funny - and often succeeds - in meetings with reporters , fans and his players . He repeatedly says the No. 1 order he has for his players is to have fun . He manages much more by old-school instincts than sabermetric intellect . But make no mistake : McKeon had a magical season , starting with an early team meeting in which first baseman Derrek Lee says " he got right in our faces , " right up to the decision to start Beckett on three days rest in Game 6 . If McKeon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot to tell him . <p> " What 's a generation gap ? " McKeon asks . " Maybe you do n't get along with your grandfather , but I 'm a grandfather who has not had that problem . " <p> " He 's not interested in development , or ego , or your feelings , " Lowell says . " He 's more of a kick-in-the-butt type guy , and his only agenda is winning . He does n't care about stats , or who 's playing or not playing . Sometimes , a young team needs that . " <p> McKeon also is wise enough to realize that next year will be different . He 'll be back - he already is looking forward to managing in the All-Star Game - but he knows a repeat of 2003 is unlikely . " This is the best club I 've ever had , and probably ever will , " he says . " Next year , we wo n't have all the same guys . " <p> Different does n't have to mean bad , of course . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to improve his teams by at least two or three positions every offseason . The Marlins are expected to field at least that many new starters in 2004 , but more because of financial reasons than a desire to get better . The club has a slew of players on the doorstep of big bucks , and not all of them will get their high-dollar deals from the Marlins . <p> Catcher Ivan Rodriguez is a free agent who wants to stay in South Florida , but he certainly will expect more than the one-year , $10 million deal the Marlins gave him in ' 03 . Second baseman Luis Castillo and closer Ugueth Urbina also are free agents and are no more likely to be re-signed than Rodriguez . Several everyday players - among them Lee , Lowell , right fielder Juan Encarnacion and shortstop Alex Gonzalez - have five-plus years of service and are due to become free agents after next season . That means they 're eligible for significant raises through arbitration this offseason . It also means any of them could be traded . Deciding whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club still is recovering from the salary dumps that followed their 1997 World Series victory . <p> " If they keep one of the big guys , Pudge or Lowell , let Castillo and maybe one other guy go , they 'd be all right , " says a rival executive . " If they lose more than that , though , they could be right back where they were . " <p> No matter who leaves , Florida 's starting pitching should be OK . The Marlins ' rotation may not be as top-heavy as the A 's or Cubs ' , but it belongs on the same scale . In each of the World Series games played in Miami last week , the Marlins started a young righthander with a mid-90s or better fastball : <p> In Game 3 , 23-year-old Beckett used his 98-mph fastball to hold the Yankees to two runs in 7 1/3 innings , only to see his effort wasted when the Yankees scored five times in the final two innings to take a 6-1 victory and 2-1 lead in the Series . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't allow a Yankee to reach third base in a 5-hit , 108-pitch shutout . <p> " Unbelievably great " was how Yankees manager Joe Torre described it . McKeon , meanwhile , wasted no time rebutting the critics who questioned his decision to use Beckett , who missed more than a month with an elbow injury in June , on short rest . " He 's got that mystique . With him , every time out , you feel you are going to win , " McKeon says . In Game 4 , another fifth-year arbitration guy , 27-year-old Carl Pavano , reached 95 with his fastball , did n't walk anyone and held the Yankees to one run through eight innings . He , too , saw his work go for naught when Urbina blew a 2-run lead in the ninth , though the Marlins won in the 12th . In Game 5 , 25-year-old Brad Penny regularly hit 99 mph while limiting the Yankees to two runs in seven innings for his second win of the Series . A 4-run lead was enough for the bullpen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center - the blast would have been a home run in many ballparks - with the tying run on in the ninth . <p> And to think , the Marlins ' rotation would have been even more impressive if the 26-year-old who has thrown harder than all of them , A.J. Burnett , were not missing because he had elbow surgery in April . <p> Even with the heat being dealt in south Florida and the fact that two-thirds of the Yankees ' lineup was slumping , the Marlins did n't exactly blow anyone away - before or during the Series . They fell behind by at least one game in all three postseason series . The Cubs had them five outs from elimination in the NLCS . Four times , the Marlins pulled out victory in their final at-bat . They were outscored ( 21-17 ) , outhit ( .261 to .232 ) and onthomered ( 6-2 ) in the World Series . <p> But , as Lowell says , " Talented guys make the most of their opportunities , " and the Marlins beat the Yankees at their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportune hits and the timely plays . In Game 4 , after Urbina gave up a 2-run , pinch-hit triple to Ruben Sierra that tied the game , the Marlins managed to survive . Gonzalez , 5-for-53 in the postseason before leading off the 12th , smacked a home run just inside the left field foul pole that won the game and proved to be the turning point in the Series . The decisive blast came on a full count after he fouled off two pitches from little-used and oft-maligned Jeff Weaver , who was making his first appearance in the postseason . Seeing the glazed look in Weaver 's eyes after the game was a hint that this may not be the typical Yankees postseason . In the first inning that night , the Marlins took a lead by scoring three times on five consecutive 2-out hits , the first four of which came with two strikes . <p> The Marlins scored four of their six runs in Game 5 with two outs and took advantage of a botched rundown by the Yankees to score the other two . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis Castillo got his only RBI of the Series by poking a 2-out , 2-strike single in the fifth . An inning later , the Marlins scored an unearned run after Jeter misplayed a routine grounder for his first error in his last 27 World Series games . <p> Now , watching Jeter fail so blatantly in October was a surprise . Watching the Marlins take advantage of it , however , should not have been . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Rodriguez set an example with his stellar postseason play ; the young Marlins followed his lead . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Gonzalez , the Game 4 hero , helped keep Nick Johnson and the Yankees down after the Series returned to New York . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Jorge Posada 's failed tag attempt against Gonzalez in Game 6 summed up the Series for the Yankees , who found victory just out of reach . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Stan McNeal <p>                    @
