In our battle against the Beatles , it was my uncle Willie who threw the first punch , and for that , he said , he should have been knighted . I did n't argue . <p> We fought them in 1966 , the year they played Araneta Coliseum in Manila , to a crowd of over one hundred thousand people . Their visit was quick ; they were scheduled to leave two days later , and as director of Manila International Airport , it was Uncle Willie 's job to make sure the Beatles ' travel went smoothly , that no press or paparazzi detain them . But the morning after their concert , Imelda Marcos demanded one more show : a Royal Command Performance for the First Lady . When reporters asked the Beatles for their reply , they said , supposedly , " If the First Lady wants to see us , why does n't she come up to our room for a special exhibition ? " Then they walked away , the newspapers wrote , laughing . <p> Uncle Willie took it hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Googi , and me . " It 's an emergency , " he said on the phone . " Come quick ! " Except for the six-pack on my bedroom floor , we had nothing better to do . <p> " Be right there , " I told him . We drank the beer , then headed out . <p> When we arrived at Uncle Willie 's apartment , he was sitting at the kitchen table , the ceiling fan spinning slow over his sweat-beaded head . His fists were clenched tight atop his lap , and the wrinkles at his eyes seemed to deepen with anger as he recounted the Beatles ' lewd remarks . " They were insulting the whole of Filipina womanhood ! " His face fell , and he shook his head , still in disbelief . " Oh my goodness . " <p> " What exhibition were they talking about exactly ? " Googi asked , seating himself across from Uncle Willie . He was the oldest of us , three months shy of twenty-one , but the slowest . " What did they mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant by it ? " Uncle snapped at him . " What do you do in the bedroom in the first place ? " <p> JohnJohn would n't let his brother answer . " It was a joke , " he said , lighting a cigarette . He reached into the refrigerator for a San Miguel ( Uncle Willie kept his refrigerator well-stocked in case any of us should drop by unexpectedly ) and pried the cap off against the edge of the kitchen counter . " A few laughs . No harm done . " He drank his beer fast , then gave me a look that said it was my turn to calm the old man down . <p> " Take it easy , " was all I could say . <p> Uncle Willie got to his feet . Nothing , he insisted , was funny about Imelda Marcos . " She is the face of our country ! " he said , pointing to a framed black and white picture of her on top of the TV . He brought it over to us and held it close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the glass I thought it might crack right over Imelda 's face and cut his skin . " Do n't you see ? " he asked . " Do n't you see ? " In the picture , Imelda was seated in a large wicker chair frilled with ribbons and flowers , staring out into the distance , her queenly face shaded beneath a parasol held by an anonymous hand . <p> " Yes , " I finally said , " I do . I see it . " Googi agreed with me , nodding . JohnJohn shrugged his shoulders and let out smoke . <p> That was enough to make Uncle Willie believe we were on his side . " Okay , " he said , " good . Then the Beatles will pay for their insolence . " He sat back down and put his elbows on the table , his forehead slumped against his clasped hands like he was in prayer . His face was hidden , but I could see the strands of his thinning gray hair , hard and slick with pomade , almost shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairs on the back of his neck had gone white . <p> JohnJohn looked at me , his face impatient , almost angry . I knew what he was thinking . He 'd been volunteering at the student paper at the university , reading up on Imelda 's questionable dealings . He clipped out articles about the workers who died in the heat building a statue of the President and the First Lady under her orders . The week before he showed us photos of families living in city dumps after Imelda had their homes bulldozed to make space for a nightclub that was never built . JohnJohn was the first person I knew who called Imelda Marcos a phony . <p> I kept my eyes on Uncle Willie . He was mumbling so softly that I only heard " Mrs. Marcos " and " those hateful Beatles " whispered in his mix of English and Tagalog , and then he went silent , motionless . For a second I thought he 'd fallen asleep , and in the next second I thought something worse . I almost reached out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was with us again . " I will need your help , " Uncle Willie announced . He rose from his chair , dimmed the lights , and drew the curtains , as though someone were watching us through binoculars or telescopes from afar . " Listen carefully to me , okay , guys ? " My cousins said of course , absolutely , no question . But they paid attention for their own amusement , for the sake of hearing Uncle Willie speak the ridiculous with heartfelt seriousness , with all the passion a man his age could muster . They did n't mean to be cruel . <p> " This is how we will defeat the Beatles , " he went on . He revealed an intricate plan , one that required him to take advantage of his position at Manila International Airport . He would divert the Beatles ' security and send the group to their gate , where we would be waiting , dressed as airport personnel , ready to pounce . " Nothing injurious , just enough for them to get the message , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his finger , drawing invisible X 's and arrows , showing who would stand where and who would do what when it was time to strike . But where he saw battle plans I saw only fingerprints streaked over the glass tabletop . My cousins ' serious faces were fake , but I tried to make mine real , tried to see things the way Uncle Willie could . I owed him that . <p> He finished his plan . " And that , " he said , " is how we will defeat the Beatles . " He turned his head from left to right slowly , reading our faces to see if we were ready for the fight . <p> " So what you 're saying , " Googi said , " is that we get to meet the Beatles . " <p> " To defeat them , yes , " Uncle Willie answered . " Of course . " <p> " But we get to meet the Beatles , " JohnJohn checked again . <p> Uncle Willie nodded slowly , as if they were the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My cousins looked at each other , then to me . " I 'm in , " Googi beamed . " I 'll help you . " <p> " Me , too , " JohnJohn said . " To beat them up , of course . " <p> Uncle Willie turned to me . You 're my uncle , is what I should have said . Of course I 'll help you . But I did n't . I looked past him instead , at a newspaper on the floor , and I saw the headline BEATLES RULE ARANETA COLISEUM , 100,000 SCREAM FOR MORE . My cousins and I had so badly wanted to see that show , but we convinced ourselves that trying would be pointless , that there was no way any of us could afford even the cheapest of tickets . We 'd accepted that they would come and go , that the most we could hope for was a muffled radio broadcast . I did n't want to admit that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " Yeah , " I said , finally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulder , smiling . " Good boys , " he said . <p> He went into his bedroom and came out with pillows and sheets stacked upon his arms . " Bedtime soon , guys . " We would need a good night 's rest , he said , if we were to defeat the Beatles the next day . <p> But only Uncle Willie went to bed ; my cousins and I stayed up , gambling away what little pocket money we had in our own version of poker . " I think Paul 's autograph will be worth the most , " Googi said , shuffling the deck . " I want it to say To Guggenheim , man of the world and dear , dear friend . " My cousin changed his name to Guggenheim when he turned thirteen , believing that if you were named after someone great , you might become someone great , too . But our grandparents could n't pronounce it , so he got stuck with Googi instead , and he only used Guggenheim for special occasions like graduation or confirmation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ask him for an autograph , " I said . " Makes sense . " <p> " We want to meet them , not beat them , " Googi whispered . <p> " This is the Beatles we 're talking about , " JohnJohn said . " You want to meet them as much as we do . " <p> Googi nodded . " Do you think Paul would sing to me if I asked him to ? " he asked . <p> JohnJohn socked him in the arm . " Do n't be such a queer . Quit talking like that . " <p> " You ca n't ask for autographs , " I told them . " That is n't why we 're doing this . " They looked at me like I was crazy , but they did n't say it . " We have a job to do , right ? " <p> " To hell with Imelda , " JohnJohn said . He shook his head , looking at her framed picture , which was still on the table . He laid it flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the glass . They looked like fireflies dancing around her , and it made her look like some sort of fairy-tale queen , friend to all creatures great and small . I flicked them off with my finger . " Filipina womanhood , my ass , " he said , lighting another cigarette . <p> " Just one song , that 's all I 'd ask for , " Googi whispered to himself , still rubbing the spot on his arm where he was hit . <p> A light was still on in Uncle Willie 's room . " Just deal , " I said . <p> In less than an hour JohnJohn and Googi were giggling drunks , and they had all my money . I was tired of letting them cheat . I finished my beer and got up from the table , a little tipsy , and went to check on my uncle . <p> He always called it the second floor , but his bedroom was just three steps up from the back of the kitchen . Despite his good pay , he lived modestly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that small one-bedroom apartment for as long as I 'd been alive . " I like my things to be close together , " he said once . I stood at the bottom step , watching him through the hanging strands of beads in the doorway as he ironed his work clothes for the next day . His arm was slow and steady over wrinkled white sleeves , and steam spouted up from the iron , coating his face . " Still awake ? " I said , to let him know I was there . <p> " You should be in bed . " <p> " So should you . " <p> " I 'm old . I do n't need sleep . But you 're still growing . " He warned me about staying up too late , telling me that my mother would not approve if she knew I spent the last and first hours of the day drinking and gambling with my cousins . <p> " I 'm nineteen now , " I reminded him . " I 'm not a kid anymore . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? " Uncle Willie shook his head , then told me to come in . <p> I sat at the foot of his bed . Across from me were the faces of Imelda , tacked and taped on the bedroom wall . There were articles and pictures everywhere , headlines which read IMELDA TAKES PARIS BY STORM and IMELDA LOVES AMERICA , AMERICA LOVES IMELDA . It was like a page from a giant scrapbook , full of airbrushed eight-by-tens and photos carefully torn from glossy magazines . But the wall was only half-covered , as though the other half was a reserved plot for the rest of Imelda 's life . In my head I filled the empty space with articles about Uncle Willie 's victory against the Beatles , and I imagined an accompanying photo of him , his arm in a sling , his face bruised black and blue with pride . A soldier still smiling after the battle , despite the hurt . " Will Imelda be there tomorrow ? " I asked . <p> " Mrs. Marcos , " he corrected me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those scrawny British rascals . " <p> Uncle Willie unplugged the iron , then slipped the shirt into an armor-gray blazer hanging on the closet door . Instead of the black tie he normally wore for work , he pulled from the top drawer a handful of ties I never knew he owned . Strips of bright silk spilled out between his fingers , and one by one he held them to the collar of his shirt , waiting for the right match . " Any of them will do , " I said , but all I really noticed was the fuss Uncle Willie was making over himself . He was in his early fifties by then , and we had all given up hope for an end to his bachelorhood . But as I watched him testing tie after tie , when I saw a newly opened bottle of cologne on top of his dresser , I thought he might be trying to put an end to that . I could smell Uncle Willie , the change in his scent . It was on his clothes , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen , but I thought that this must be love , that if something could change you so much then maybe , in the end , it was worth fighting for , even if you were n't going to be loved back . <p> He reached for another tie but set it down , laughing at himself like he was being silly . " Simple is best , " he decided . He looped the black tie around the collar . <p> " No . This one works better . " I took it away and replaced it with a turquoise tie patterned with silver paisleys . " It goes with the gray . " <p> Uncle Willie took a step back , studying the outfit like someone trying to understand a strange piece of art . " Okay , " he said . He sat on edge of his bed and bent over , wiping away a bit of dust from his shoe . He stayed that way for a moment , then asked , " Do you think I 'm crazy ? " <p> " What ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said again . It was the kind of question that most people ask with an answer already in their heads , the kind of question you ask only to see if the answer you get is the one you 're hoping for . But when Uncle Willie looked up at me , his face was blank ; I really do n't think he knew what the answer was , and whatever I said he would be willing to accept . <p> " I think you 're dutiful , " was what I finally told him . He did n't know what it meant . " Dutiful , " I repeated . " It 's like the obedient son who does what he 's told . Or the knight who enters a battle without asking why . " This was the best definition I could give him . The answer seemed to please him . <p> But I could n't leave it at that . " I just do n't understand why the Beatles mean so much to her . What have they ever done that 's so great anyway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one , he said , should ever second-guess the First Lady 's intentions , not after all she had done for our country . He insisted that because of her , the world looked at us differently . " She dazzles and inspires , " he said . " How many of us are able to do that ? " His voice was breaking , but he continued , reminding me that no matter how famous Imelda Marcos became , no matter how many times she flew off into the world , she always came back . " She belongs to us , " he explained . " She will never leave us . It is our duty as men to protect her good name . " <p> " Right . " I looked past him , at an autographed photo of Imelda beside his bed . For Willy , she misspelled , who keeps me safe in the sky . Always , Imelda . " It 's getting late , " I said . I told him goodnight and exited through the hanging beads . At the bottom step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger then press it against her picture ; not on the lips or on the cheek  --  that would n't be appropriate for someone of his station  --  but on a spot near her shoulder , just above her heart . That part of her was sore , Uncle Willie once read , from all the corsages that had been pinned there during her travels abroad . " You see what she does for us ? " he 'd said . " It aches her to leave us , even for just a short while . " <p> Then from behind me a clumsy two-part harmony started up . " You 're gon na lose that girl , yes yes you 're gon na lose that girl , " my drunk cousins crooned to Uncle Willie , " you 're gon na loooose that giiiirrl . " <p> " Leave him alone , " I told them , pushing them back into the living room . " He 's fine . " <p> The dozen San Miguels hit my cousins hard ; JohnJohn was passed out on the couch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talking back to his dreams as he always did . It was almost three a.m. , and I was wide-awake on the floor , listening to the slow turn of the ceiling fan as it tried to cool the air . <p> It was n't the Beatles that kept me up . Though we were going to meet them the next day , nothing felt different about that night before ; even if Uncle Willie had n't called on us , we still would have ended up at his apartment , drinking too much , playing bad poker , trying to ignore the dullness of life . We had been spending nights at Uncle Willie 's ever since we were kids . Whenever we needed an easy escape from our parents and their rules , Uncle Willie was always there for us : if we did n't want to go to Sunday mass , he would let us hide in his apartment , then drive us to meet our mothers when it was over , telling them that he found us seated on the balcony level , praying hard ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , and he gave us garlic to chew to hide our ashy smell . " I do not approve , " he made it clear , " but someone should supervise at least . " Our every small rebellion he willingly indulged , and I was never ungrateful , but I hoped that one day we would n't need his help , that my cousins and I would venture out to somewhere far away . But after high school we all ended up at small local colleges , and none of us could afford to live in the dormitories . There was no travel , no journey ; all I wanted was to wake up , just once , in a different place . <p> It was dark , but I could navigate my way through the living room easily . Uncle Willie 's magazine rack was to the right of his recliner , his footstool next to the TV . I knew where JohnJohn 's head was on the couch , where on the coffee table Googi rested his feet . Even in our sleep everything was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table . It was warm , but I opened it anyway , then stepped out the back door into the alley behind Uncle Willie 's apartment building . It felt like another normal night  --  sticky and dark , a sky without stars  --  but there was music coming from the street . " Oh you 've gone away this morning , " someone sang , " you 'll be back again tonight . " It was the Beatles , and I walked to it , still barefoot , drinking my beer slowly . On the sidewalk I saw two boys not much younger than me , wearing pegged pants and button-up , short-sleeve shirts , sitting on a vinyl couch that had been left on the street . One played an acoustic guitar , the other slapped his knees like a drum , and they were singing Beatles songs to an audience of three school-aged girls seated on the hood of a rusting jeep that was missing its front right wheel . They played and sang reasonably well , and the girls swayed their heads in time to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying to fool themselves into believing that it really was the Beatles playing before them . <p> " I 'm going to meet them , " I told them . " Tomorrow . " <p> The one playing guitar lifted his finger from the strings . " Who ? " <p> " The Beatles . All four of them . " <p> " Liar , " he said . <p> " No , " I said , " really . I 'm going to meet them tomorrow . " <p> " We know who you are , " one of the girls said accusingly . She slid down the hood of the car to the sidewalk . " We 've seen you before . You live here , too . " <p> " I live in the next town over , " I said , as if it made a difference . " And I 'm not a liar . " <p> " You 're crazy , " another girl said . She spit on my foot . She turned to the girl beside her , and they giggled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They began again . " You 'll never leave me and you know it 's true , " the boys sang , and the girls swayed and snapped along . I could have kept talking , revealed the plan altogether . But I lost my nerve . Instead I just told them to keep it down , that it was too late in the night and too early in the morning for them to be playing around like that . I walked back into the alley and drank my beer fast , hoping it would help me sleep and keep me still . <p> A pot of hot Milo and a platter of half-burnt toast were on the kitchen table when we woke the next morning . " Come on , guys , " Uncle Willie said , clapping his hands twice . " Eat up . Big day today . " We made our way slowly to the table , and he went to get dressed . <p> The taste of beer still coated my tongue and teeth , but I did n't want Uncle Willie 's efforts to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke off burnt crust from the bread . " Someone help me with this , " I said , pushing the toast to the center of the table . <p> JohnJohn already had a cigarette going . " Not hungry . " <p> " Me , neither , " Googi yawned . " Why ca n't the Beatles come to us instead ? Maybe we could schedule an afternoon tea . That 's what they do in England . " <p> " How would you know ? " JohnJohn blew smoke in his face . " You 've never been to England , dummy . " <p> " Someday , " Googi said , fanning the smoke away . " Maybe . " <p> " Would someone eat some of this ? " I repeated . <p> " Forget afternoon tea . Let 's make it an afternoon drink instead . Run up a bar tab on Imelda 's bill . " JohnJohn tapped ashes on a saucer , then put his head down on the table . <p> Uncle Willie came into the kitchen . He 'd heard what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being lazy rascals . To prove his point , he brought out a book called The Quotable Imelda : Famous Quotes by Imelda Marcos . I 'd seen it before in high school ; it was required reading for senior English classes . " Listen to this , " Uncle Willie said , opening to a bookmarked page , " and you try to follow her example . " He cleared his throat , then shared her wisdom . " The truth is that life is so beautiful and life is so prosperous and life is so full of potential and life has so much good in it that really , one should not have time to sleep . I have no time to sleep . You only get bored if you are tired . And I only get bored and tired with ugliness , with negativism and evil and all of that . " <p> JohnJohn raised his head , wanting to speak , but Uncle Willie would n't stop . <p> " I start in the morning and I feel that we all have one thousand energy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful program , a beautiful person , a beautiful smile , a beautiful child , by that time it 's midnight . I 'm just about ready to take off ! I have a million energy , no longer one thousand ! Everybody 's falling apart and I can not understand . " Then Uncle Willie closed the book gently , solemn as a priest . " Think about it , " he said , turning to his room , " and finish your breakfast . " <p> I looked at JohnJohn , and all I wanted was for him to laugh , to make a joke of the sheer stupidity of the First Lady , of our entire situation , anything to break the stone look on his face that stays with me even now . " Everybody 's falling apart , and she ca n't understand , " he said , letting out smoke . <p> " This is n't about her , " I whispered . But JohnJohn just lit up another cigarette then left to smoke outside . Googi got up to get ready . I stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbs , our ashes , the smudges and smears of battle plans from the night before . <p> Uncle Willie walked back into the kitchen . His hair was slick and crisp . His blazer was buttoned all the way up , his oxfords gleamed at their tips , and he smelled like cheap cologne . <p> The parking lot of Manila International Airport looked like a protest against war : high above the crowds were banners and signs , and all you could hear was the noisy overlap of shouting voices . As our taxi slowly pulled up to the curb , I thought that maybe Uncle Willie was right , that maybe the Beatles really had done something terrible to bring together so many people . But when I stepped out I could understand what they were saying : BEATLES WE LOVE YOU and BEATLES COME BACK were painted in block letters on huge pieces of paper , were screamed in chorus by weeping teenagers . A line of arm-linked policemen held them back . <p> JohnJohn and I walked toward the entrance , but Googi turned to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blew kisses , like they were gathered there for him . " I 'm bigger than the Beatles , " he laughed . Uncle Willie , losing patience , scooted him along . <p> Uncle Willie flashed his ID to security . " They are with me , " he gestured to the three of us . Uncle Willie had given us security blazers and nametags , and the guard let us through . It was a rule that only ticketed passengers were allowed inside , but with all the chaos the Beatles were causing in Manila , few people were traveling that weekend , and many of the outbound flights had been canceled . The long stretch of the ticket counter was almost empty , unmanned except for a few bored agents who watched the clock , twirled pens in one hand , put their heads down and napped . I had n't been to Manila International in four years , and this was the first time I 'd seen more excitement outside than inside the airport . <p> The Beatles were scheduled to depart from Gate 44 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrities and their private jets . " It is where the First Lady waits patiently for her flights , and she was generous enough to let the Beatles use it , " he said . " Ungrateful scoundrels . " <p> We walked past the duty-free gift shops , the near-empty waiting areas . At the end of the terminal , Uncle Willie reached for his keys and unlocked a door that read AIRPORT SECURITY ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT . " Let 's go , let 's go , " he said , holding the door open for us . I turned around , convinced we were being watched , maybe followed , but the few people in the terminal made nothing of our presence . <p> We stepped into a long white corridor , windowless and silent except for the hum of the track of fluorescent lights above . We walked single file , Uncle Willie , Googi , JohnJohn , then me , and no one said a word . I looked back at the white emptiness behind me , and I had the feeling that the farther we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back . " Almost there , " Uncle Willie said . <p> He unlocked another door . We walked out and immediately stepped onto an escalator that took us to Gate 44 , a small square of a room furnished with a couch and two wingchairs , a Victorian-style coffee table in the center . To the side was a fireplace that did n't look quite real , and above it was a painting of a life-size Imelda Marcos , her head slightly tilted , her open palms at the end of reaching arms crowned with butterfly sleeves . " Run ! " JohnJohn whispered to me . " Before she destroys us with her one million energy ! " I told him to shut up , but it really did look like those Imelda-arms were out to pull us into her , either to cradle or strangle us to death . <p> Uncle Willie called us to attention and reviewed the plan once more . As soon as they arrived , he would escort the Beatles to Gate 44 and have them proceed up the escalator . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the group 's bodyguards were properly diverted by his security staff . " And then finally , I will join you up here to crush the Beatles . " My cousins nodded as if they were with him each step of the way , but my eyes were fixed on the mess of paisleys knotted at his throat , and how wrong they looked in the daylight . <p> " But who are we ? " I asked . " What are we supposed to be doing when they get here ? " <p> " Just act like you 're supposed to be here , " Uncle Willie said , pointing to my nametag , " as if you are meant to be here . " Then he shook each of our hands , wished us luck , and left . <p> Standing there , alone with my cousins in a room meant only for the most important travelers in the world , I believed I was answering a call of duty . I kept my fists clenched and my head up , ready for the fight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all we had on us was pen and paper for autographs , a camera hidden in Googi 's pants pocket , and " Ticket to Ride " boomed inside my head . <p> JohnJohn 's watch read two o'clock . An hour had passed since we saw Uncle Willie go down the escalator . Restless and bored , JohnJohn and Googi began taking swings at the air , sparring with each other like martial arts masters . " We must be ready , " Googi said , imitating Uncle Willie , " if we wish to defeat the Fab Four ! " <p> JohnJohn stepped up on the table . " In the name of Imelda , " he shouted , fist in the air , " die ! " He jumped off , slamming a palm on Googi 's head upon landing . <p> I went to the window and looked out onto the runway . There were only a handful of airplanes out that day , and none of them were taking off . Beneath the shade of a wing a group of cargo workers sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around their necks . The day was especially humid , and the heat in the air blurred and rippled the runway and everything on it , like the special effects for a dream sequence on TV . It was as though the planes were n't real , as if the possibility of departure and flight were just an illusion and a hoax . <p> When I was a kid , Uncle Willie always brought me along to the airport , and he showed it off like it was his . " You see all those people leaving and returning ? " he said to me on my first visit . " I am the one who is responsible for them . " <p> " Where do they go ? " I asked . I was five years old . <p> " That way , " he pointed skyward , then moved his hand to the side . " Then that way . " I always assumed he meant the States . <p> Uncle Willie lifted me up , bringing me close to the window . The glass felt hot against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revving engines . But when their wheels left the ground , I had to look away ; I could n't believe that something so big and heavy with metal parts could stay afloat in the air . I thought of emergency landings , of airplanes bobbing in the middle of the ocean . " Will you go , too ? " I asked . <p> Uncle Willie shook his head , promising me that he was n't going anywhere , that it was his job to stay behind to make sure everything ran just right . I loved him for that . Growing up , I watched branches of my family breaking off as they headed to the States , aunts and uncles taking my cousins and my friends with them . The year I turned twelve , I lost my mother , too . For years she watched her sisters pack up as soon as their husbands ' requests for transfer went through . Fighting with my father was how she dealt with being left . I 'm stuck here , she would say , and she blamed him nightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rest of the men ? Where is your ambition ? Do n't you at least want your son to be somebody ? My mother stood behind me when she said this , cupping my shoulders with her hands , presenting me as an example of my father 's failure . He looked at me apologetically , but he never said a word . <p> But she finally got to go . Her younger sister bought her a ticket , and my mother started packing that same day . Tourist visa only , she assured me the morning she left . I wanted to see her off at the gate , but a sign read NO WELL-WISHERS BEYOND THIS POINT , and the guard refused to let me go with her . I wanted to tell him that the sign did n't pertain to me , that I did n't wish my mother well at all , that in fact , I wished her a terrible trip , a time so awful she would take the first flight back to Manila . But my father held me back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearance . Tourists ca n't stay forever , my father reminded me as we drove home . I took that technicality as my guarantee for her return , but six months later , on the back of a postcard of the Golden Gate Bridge , I learned that the visa had become a green card . The weather is good for my health , for my skin , she wrote . You should see how well I look . I told my father I did n't know she 'd been sick . He said he did n't know it , either . He handed me the card , put on his hat , then left to play mah-jongg with his friends at the corner cantina . But Uncle Willie was there , and he told me not to worry . " She 'll be back , " he promised , and he looked like he really did believe she would return . He took the postcard from my hand and put it in his pocket . We got into his car , picked up JohnJohn and Googi , and he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my fear of leaving turned to envy . When I turned thirteen , Uncle Willie got me a job at the airport helping passengers with their bags . While I dragged and pushed along heavy pieces of luggage , they would walk ahead of me , fanning themselves with their tickets like they were flaunting their travels . I never checked their destinations ; all I knew was that they were leaving for someplace far away , and that their eventual return would be a triumphant one , like astronauts coming back from outer space . I wanted that bit of triumph , so I play-acted myself into those airport reunions I saw throughout the day : I would get off the plane and find my family waiting , their arms spread out in welcome , my cousins asking question after question , everyone impressed by the way I changed . <p> But when I finally took a month-long trip to visit my mother in California for my fifteenth birthday , my homecoming was a disappointment . Only Uncle Willie was waiting for me at the airport , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the service was satisfactory , if I was able to sleep away the long hours to make the trip feel quicker than it was . " It 's good that you are back , " he said , loading my bags into the trunk of a taxi . He paid the driver and told him to take me home . I rolled the windows down , and the back seat filled with a mugginess , a thick and heavy air I had n't really noticed before . It clung to me , and all I wanted was to feel cool again , the way I did in California . When I got home , no one was there ; my father was out , and JohnJohn and Googi did n't collect their souvenir T-shirts until the next afternoon . For the next month , I slept through the day and paced the house at night , restless and sweaty , my body and mind still on American time . I thought back then that it was the seventeen-hour difference that inverted my days . Four years later , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " The Beatles are coming , " into my ear , I knew that jetlag had nothing to do with my ruined sleep . <p> We heard voices below . From above we watched Uncle Willie direct the Beatles toward the escalator . As planned , there were no porters to assist them with their luggage , and I heard Paul complain about the weight of his bags . " Porter shortage in the Philippines ? " he said . His voice was clear and smooth , without the static of the bad reception we always seemed to get in Manila . <p> " No porter ? " Ringo asked . " I 'll take whatever 's on draft , then . " <p> Uncle Willie hurried them along . As soon as each Beatle was on his way , my uncle looked at us and gave the thumbs up . It 's up to you now , was what I read in his face , so I shut my eyes , trying to remember his plans from the night before , the X 's and arrows indicating who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image in my head was his thin wrinkled finger , the nail chipped and yellow at the end , dragging across the table . <p> But even that picture faded away when the Beatles finally came . Until that moment , I 'd known them only as a single sound of blended voices among guitar riffs and drumbeats . I would play their records and watch the needle curve along the grooves , then try to work my own voice into their harmonies . I always sang in secret , embarrassed by my voice ; when no one was in the house I would sit on the floor next to the stereo speakers , shut my eyes , and belt out their words like they were truths about myself . And now they were here , and they were real , entering my life one by one as the escalator steps rose and vanished into the floor : Ringo then Paul then George and finally John , who was holding a giant seashell to his ear . They were each dressed in bright , loose-fitting shirts that seemed to change color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized their skin was the same way ; their white English faces held a bit of pink in their cheeks , their necks had faint patches of orange and brown , from the Philippine sun . It was a sign of their travels , evidence of the world , proof that you could move through it and keep it with you . I remember standing there by that fake fireplace , standing between my cousins in our borrowed blazers and fake nametags , thinking , This is it . This is the real thing . This is what it means to be in the world . <p> Ringo was the first to speak to us . " There 's no porter shortage at all , " he said . He waved hello . I waved back . JohnJohn and Googi waved , too . <p> " No , but shorter porters they are , " Paul said , tapping each of us on the head . " But you can take these onto the plane if you do n't mind . " He dropped his carry-on luggage to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up two bags . I followed his lead . But Googi just stood there , sweaty and pale . He was almost reverent in the way he looked at Paul , and he kept swallowing , like he wanted to speak . " My name is  --  " he finally said , but he was so nervous he mispronounced it . <p> " Huggengeim ? " Ringo said , one eyebrow raised . " Type of cheese , is n't it ? All the same , nice ring to it . " <p> " Thank you , " Googi beamed . <p> Paul leaned into us . " You boys ever listen to the ocean ? " <p> We shook our heads no . <p> " Mean to tell me you live on this island , and you never heard the ocean ? Hey , John , " Paul said , still looking at us , " give the lads a listen . " John looked up , a bit irritated , unwilling to surrender his shell . <p> " Oh , do n't be so chintzy , " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what chintzy meant  --  it sounded French and German and Chinese all at once  --  but the three of us joined in the laughter anyway , like we were having a real conversation with the Beatles , though I had n't said a single word myself , never told them my name . It did n't matter . JohnJohn looked truly happy for the first time in months , and even now I 'm sure there were joyful tears welling in Googi 's eyes . All I felt was a feeling of arrival , that feeling of awakeness that comes with the impact of landing . I wanted to plant myself there , take root in that moment with the Beatles , and never leave it , not ever . <p> Quick as it was , the picture of it is clearer to me now : the Beatles in a line , facing my cousins and me , a four-on-three standoff that should be in mid-battle . But what Uncle Willie finds when he reaches the top of the escalator is a friendly exchange between his enemy and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn to look at him I 'm just stuck , like someone ankle-deep in hardening mud , and I ca n't run or hide or change my traitorous face . I betrayed my uncle Willie , and the woman he loved . <p> So I acted . <p> " Now ! " I said . I stepped away from the group , then pushed a potted plant over , hoping it would crash upon a Beatle like a fallen tree , pinning him to the ground . But it just landed softly on a wingchair and dirt spilled everywhere , soiling Paul 's and Ringo 's shoes . I kept going , throwing their bags across the room and into the fake fireplace , and Uncle Willie nodded , like everything was going according to plan after all , and he stepped forward , too . I picked up another carry-on , hurling it onto the Down escalator . Take that , Beatles , was the intended message , but it fell slowly like a tumbleweed , and the only reaction I remember was George saying , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to check that in . " I ignored them both , and took the gift basket of mangoes at Ringo 's feet and kicked it over , the fruit rolling onto the floor , and I picked them up and threw them hard against the ground like grenades . All the while , Googi struggled to work the flash on his camera , and JohnJohn took fast , nervous drags of his cigarette , looking confused in a corner of the room . " Do n't just stand there , " I said , but as soon as I ran out of things to knock over and throw , all I could do was remove myself from the scene , too . <p> But Uncle Willie would n't stop . He took John by the collar , his head bent back so he could look him in the eye . " So you are the rascals who are more popular than Jesus Christ ? " he questioned knowingly . John nodded , the shell still at his ear , but my uncle persisted , trying to shake him into submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what I saw next was his hand curl into a fist and then the shell drop to the ground . It broke in two , and suddenly there were a dozen other bodies  --  they looked like real airport security-rushing up the escalator , screaming and cursing the Beatles for defaming the First Lady and the rest of the country . " Come on , everybody ! " Uncle Willie called out to them . His back was to me , and I could n't tell if he 'd planned this from the start , if somehow he knew that we would fail him in the end . <p> The mob closed in on the group . I fought my way in to pull Uncle Willie out , but when I reached for his shoulder he turned and swiped my arm away , telling me to leave him alone , to get out , to go . Then someone shoved me , and I fell backwards to the ground . Next to my hand was a mango , so I picked it up and threw it hard against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her chest . An orange , pulpy ooze bloomed like a flower , then dripped down like blood . I wanted to call out to Uncle Willie , to show him what I had done , but my cousins grabbed me , pulling me toward the escalator . " It 's over , " JohnJohn said . " Let 's go . " We ran down , and all I saw when I looked back was my uncle vanish in the haze , his old thin arms lost among the shaking fists , his war cry in the name of love dulled down to the background noise of Imeldamania . <p> We ran through the corridor and headed for the entrance . " What about Uncle Willie ? " Googi said . I told him to forget him , that there was nothing we could do . I kept running , my body perspiring in the thick polyester blazer , the nametag flopping up and down against my chest . I finally stopped , hunched over and out of breath , at the long line of police trying to contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cried out , " Beatles , do n't leave us , Beatles , do n't go . " <p> The three of us took a taxi back to my house . In the end , the Beatles ' own security team broke up the fight and made sure the group made it to their plane . No serious harm was done , but the Beatles never came our way again . <p> " Yes , " Googi told reporters , " we witnessed the whole thing . " We ended up making the papers , the international news , and for the first time the world came to us , calling us late at night , knocking on our doors early in the morning for interviews . Googi basked in his brief fame , and JohnJohn tried to use the spotlight to expose the corruption in the Marcos government , but reporters just stopped their tape recorders and put down their pens when he spoke . I stayed quiet , letting everyone else remember and tell the story however they wanted . <p> But Uncle Willie made his role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end was a reprimand from the President himself . And Imelda Marcos  --  essence of Filipina womanhood , face of our country-called the incident a breach of Filipino hospitality , and she offered more quotable wisdom to help the people understand what had happened . " In life , ugliness must sometimes occur , " she said . " But when such ugliness happens , only beauty can arrive , ' to save the day , ' so to speak . Despite the ugly events of the past days , beauty has returned , so let 's focus only on the beautiful things and let beauty live on . " Ashamed for any embarrassment he brought to the First Lady , Uncle Willie issued an official apology , and resigned soon after . <p> But he did n't disappear . " I still have one million energy , " he said , and he was often seen at the airport , making sure everything continued to run smoothly and that Imelda 's flights were on schedule . He remained a fixture there , never quite coming or going , but always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me . <p> Years later , when I made my final trip to the Philippines from California , I visited Uncle Willie , who still lived alone in his apartment . I was the last , the only one left , and he was anxious for my visit . Googi had run off to Hong Kong with an English businessman years before , and JohnJohn was dead , one of the few to take a Marcos bullet in 1986 . Things were n't the same , not really , but when I walked into his apartment , I struggled to find any change : the ceiling fan still creaked when it turned , beads hung in the doorway , our places were still at the kitchen table . The only difference was that Imelda 's presence had grown . There were more stories and pictures crowding his bedroom wall , as if she had never left , as if she was still the First Lady . <p> We did very little that week ; Uncle Willie was over eighty years old , and all he wanted to do was nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me he had something to show me , and he put a videocassette into the VCR . " Watch , " he said , pressing the PLAY button . The screen went blue , and suddenly the Beatles appeared on the screen , doing an interview in which they mentioned the incident that we helped make famous . " Do you remember the battle ? " he asked from his wheelchair . " How bravely we fought ? " I smiled and told him I could never forget . <p> I turned up the volume . " I hated the Philippines , " Ringo said bluntly . George and John agreed , smoking before the cameras , but Paul was more introspective . " It was one of those places where you knew they were waiting for a fight , " he said . Uncle Willie nodded , confirming its truth . I stared at the Beatles ' faces , and I wondered if they remembered mine , if they would know who I was if they saw me now . <p> " If I had been an American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been knighted . " I did n't tell him that they only do that in England . In America , you might get a compliment in the papers , maybe a medal for bravery , but nothing that big . You would be the same person as when you started , long before the fight . That much I 'd come to know . Still , I told him yes , that most certainly he would have been knighted , and I proceeded to create for him a picture of the ceremony , of Uncle Willie on his knee and Imelda on her throne , a sword in her hand , its blade gentle on his shoulder . <p> <p> By Lysley A.
