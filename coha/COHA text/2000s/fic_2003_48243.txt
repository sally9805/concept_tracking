Here we bring you the tale of a heist , but as you might expect from Mr. Di Filippo , this story is not the sort of thing you 're likely to find portrayed on any of the many TV crime shows . Not yet , anyway , but perhaps the day after tomorrow ... Speaking of the near future , Mr. Di Filippo reports a new book or two will be out before too long . In addition to the four books he published in 2002 ( the collections Little Doors , and Babylon Sisters , the novel A Mouthful of Tongues , and the novella One Year in the Linear City ) , he expects a collection of " Plumage from Pegasus " columns to appear later this year and a novel entitled Spondulix is in the works . <p> RON FEWSMTTH WAS ABOUT to rob a bank . Armed only with a color Palm Pilot . In person , not virtually . Pausing momentarily outside the heavy glass doors of Merchants " Trust , Fewsmith mentally ticked off the steps in his plan again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cinemaphile 's brain . But as customers bustled past him , intent on doing their business this bright Monday morning , Fewsmith broke his reverie , realizing he should n't dawdle too long in this spot , lest he attract attention . Still , he hesitated a moment longer , highlighting the stages of his scheme . He felt assured about all aspects involving the human element . Long months of diligent experimentation had left him confident that no individual in the bank would offer him any resistance , so long as he held firmly to his little Digital Assistant and remained free to deploy it . In fact , events should transpire so smoothly that no employee of the bank would realize that a robbery was even in progress . Only reconciliation of the day 's transactions later that night would reveal a shortage of cash . And by then Fewsmith would be safely home , untraceable . No , his only risk lay in the security cameras . The cameras made him sweat . There was no way that he could alter the images recorded by these monitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large handlebar mustache reminiscent of one a nineteenth-century pugilist might have favored . Colored contacts altered his eyes . His clothing betokened some recent immigrant to these shores , perhaps a rube from the Balkans or outermost Albania . And his burlesque accent had been practiced for days . Thus armed and accoutered Fewsmith felt , on the whole , confident of success . So : no more hesitation over this highly practical debut of his invention . Into the bank ! After joining the short line of customers standing more or less patiently in the chute of velvet ropes , Fewsmith quickly advanced to lead position . When called by the next available teller , Fewsmith put on a big smile and strode boldly forward . The teller - a young pimple-faced fellow wearing a clip-on tie - instinctively smiled back . " How can I help you , sir ? " Fewsmith removed a sheaf of tattered foreign currency from his pocket and plopped it on the counter . " You change ? " " Oh , I 'm sorry , sir , you 'll have to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No understand . Please to use translator . " Fewsmith proffered the Palm Pilot and the clerk reluctantly took it . " Is this like some kind of computer dictionary ? What do I do ? " " Push button here . " The teller depressed the indicated control . Instantly a series of whirling alien glyphs , phantasmagorical in their variety and motions , flooded the color screen . When these icons cleared they were followed by a compressed digital movie , flickering at a subliminal rate . Fewsmith had carefully crafted the loop out of snippets from an old industrial training film that depicted stacks of cash being removed from a drawer and passed through a teller 's slot . The clerk seemed staggered for a millisecond by this mini-movie , but quickly recovered , his faculties apparently undisturbed . " I 'm sorry , sir , but this screen 's blank . Your machine must be broken . " Handing the device back , the teller reached into his cash drawer and removed a half-dozen fat stacks of banded cash . His hands seemed to be operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared his brain and body . The effect was disconcerting even to Fewsmith , who had witnessed it before . Passing the money to Fewsmith , the teller said , " Thank you , sir . Have a nice day . " Fewsmith deposited both the bait money and the U.S. cash in capacious coat pockets . " Tenk you . " Fewsmith nodded to the armed security guard on the way out , ready with a second digital movie , tailored for just such a situation and safely stored in the terabyte memory of the PDA , to show the guard if necessary . But the rent-a-cop suspected nothing and merely nodded politely back . Outside the bank Fewsmith walked several blocks to an alley . He discarded his mustache in a dumpster , found the change of clothes he had hidden there and swiftly donned them . He transferred the money to new pockets . The Albanian costume joined the mustache in the trash . He retrieved his car another few blocks on and headed home . Triumph ! Willadean would be most proud of him ! Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if not - well , Fewsmith tremulously admitted a harsh yet welcome truth to himself for the first time . If Willadean continued to play hard to get , he now knew for sure that he could have her against her will , or any woman he wanted . " Tenk you very much ! " STINGO STRINE TILTED back the Paw Sox cap atop his balding head and scratched his gleaming pate . He studied the imploring , hopeful , anxious face of the president of Merchants " Trust , a corpulent fellow named Shawn Hockaday . The immaculately besuited fat man looked as if he were on the verge of tears . Strine felt a deep urge to help the poor guy . But at the moment he felt as baffled as the executive himself obviously did . " Play the tape again , please , " Strine urged in a desperate bid for inspiration . Hockaday thumbed the remote control , and both Strine and he concentrated on the screen of the small TV in the president 's office . The camera perspective was from high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The black-and-white images were remarkably crisp . All events unfolded in plain sight . Nonetheless , they remained as baffling as ever . The mustached man lent his PDA to the clerk , who studied it for only a moment before returning it , along with approximately one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in unmarked , un-dye-packed bills . Then the customer left and the teller went calmly about his business . The tape ended and Hockaday turned to Strine . " It was a simple holdup note on the PDA screen , was n't it ? That 's what it had to be . " " Well , you know , that 's exactly what I thought at first . Some new high-tech twist on the oldest routine imaginable . But a simple note demanding dough does n't explain the rest of it . " Strine referred to the fate of the hapless teller , who had been immediately suspected of collusion with the thief . Upon discovery of his malfeasance , he had been hauled shaking and stammering into police interrogation . Steadfastly denying all wrong-doing or even knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polygraph test , but also to a course of sodium pentothal . Both approaches had been conclusive . As far as the teller knew , nothing unusual had occurred that day . No robbery , no foreign customer . When shown the tape of his actions , he had fainted . Revived and white-faced , he looked as if he had walked into his apartment and discovered his doppelganger screwing his girlfriend . " Any luck on enlarging the screen of the PDA so we could read it ? " asked Strine . " None . The face of the device was blocked by Mr. Fergus 's body . " Strine stood up with barely contained irritation . The absurd face of the robber , his baffling actions - both irked him immensely . How had this guy done it ? In fact , what had he even done ? This situation was more frustrating than the Buckner Tunnel . Not since the botched rotator-cuff surgery that had ended his professional career had he felt so powerless . Strine hated to look uncertain in front of a client , especially one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these past six months , and scoring big here could garner him lots more business . Generally , Strine avoided hypothesizing openly before a client , but in this case frustration forced the words out of him . " Maybe the PDA was chemically tainted with some kind of knockout drug or hallucinogen . But the perp did n't wear gloves . And what kind of drug has those effects ? Leaving someone awake , making him act against his will , then wiping his memory ? Could it be hypnotism ? It did n't look like any hypnotism I 've ever seen . And it was over too fast . " " Mr. Strine , we summoned you because we felt we needed more coverage than the authorities could provide . But if you feel the dimensions of this investigation are beyond you , perhaps we should call in a larger agency . " " No ! Give me a fair shot at it . I 've only just come on the case . If I do n't have something solid to report in twenty-four hours , then you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll be awaiting your first report . " Strine was ushered genteelly out the back door . Out on the street , he belabored his brain . Who could he consult about this ? What kind of expert ? A hacker ? But there had been nothing extraordinary about the PDA , no online mumbo-jumbo . No , the answer had to lie in what Fergus had seen on the screen- What Fergus had seen . Now Strine knew whom he had to visit . If only Professor Parrish Maxfield would talk to him after that very unfortunate date Strine had taken her on . Willadean Lawes riffled the stack of cash gleefully as Ron Fewsmith looked on with hopeful adoration , an adoration tinged , however , with no small impatience . Her lustrous tawny hair - a mop big as a muskrat - swirled as Willadean tossed a handful of bills into the air with a shout . She failed to note her boyfriend 's subliminal impatience ; or , if noted , she could not be bothered to cater to the emotion . The sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . To think that little Willadean , whom all the good folks of Pine Mountain , Georgia , had looked down on as white trash , now had enough money to buy the best house back home in her native town . Well , maybe not the old Bishop mansion , but at least a house better than the drafty shack she had been born and raised up in . And this was just the start ! From here on out , Ron and Willadean were on Easy Street . They 'd soon be deeper in cash and all the good things of life than a mudbug in muck . Finally Willadean Lawes would have what she deserved . And when Willadean rolled back into Pine Mountain , dressed in designer clothes and sitting pretty behind the wheel of a big new Cadillac , she 'd just like to see Sherri Bishop try to look down her nose at her . Why , her sneer would be big as a doublewide trailer ! Fewsmith reached across the table and gently stroked Willadean 's wrist . " Dearest , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring bank robber ? " Leaning across the table , Willadean gave her beau a peck on the cheek . His disappointment rivaled her glee . " Willadean - " Fewsmith began stridently . " Oh , hush now , Ron . You know I ai n't letting you into my pants until after we 're married . And there wo n't be no marriage until we are on a totally solid financial footing . That 's why we need to start thinking about making our big score , and soon . " Fewsmith 's hand strayed menacingly toward his bolstered Palm Pilot , but Willadean only leered in supreme confidence . " Now do n't go thinking you 're gon na start sending instructions to my ol " Executive Structure that easily . It 's a neat trick you 've discovered , but it only works if the victim ai n't ready for it . All 's I 've got ta do is shut my eyes or look away , and your gimmick is useless . And do n't think I did n't see you uploadmg all those porno loops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . Lord , I never knew anyone could make plain ol " sex as complicated as those folks did ! But you 'll just have to restrain yourself a little longer . Grub up some rocks in the pasture , or chop some logs for the woodpile . That always worked for my Daddy after Momma passed on , God bless her soul . " Fewsmith looked disconcerted . " Pasture ? Woodpile ? I live in a condominium , Willadean ! " " No matter , you get my drift . " Fewsmith 's face assumed a devious expression . " What if I use the Level One Bypasser on some other woman then ? Would you be angry with me ? " Willadean experienced a deep satisfaction at this proposal . Having Fewsmith despunked by someone else would be a relief . So long as the unlucky bitch did n't set her claws into Willadean 's gravy train . But she was crafty enough not to show her true feelings . Frowning , she said , " Well , I do n't know . I 'd be awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to a little tomcatting before he gets hitched . " Smiling broadly , Fewsmith said , " It 's settled then . I promise you I 'll be extremely careful , Willadean . I 'll use all the proper protection . You have nothing to fear in the way of venereal repercussions . " Willadean paused a moment to consider her own variegated past love life , then said , " That 's mighty thoughtful of you , Ron . " Then , despite her initial lack of interest in the topic , she became intrigued by the notion of Ron Fewsmith attempting to seduce some strange woman , even with the aid of his Consciousness Bypassing Device . Hard to imagine any sexual bravado from this joker , even armed with his digital seducer . Why , when she had latched onto him in that yuppie bar a year ago , she damn near had to drag him out from under his barstool . " You just gon na walk up to some gal on the street and zap her ? " " Far from it . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's seen fit to deride my scientific abilities in the past . My only regret is that she wo n't retain any memory of the proof that my theories were correct all along . " PROFESSOR PARRISH MAXFIELD had a run in her stockings , a long hideous laddering from ankle to hemline ( and that border hovered well above her knees ) , visible from across a large room , and the sartorial blemish could n't have surfaced at a worse time . Not only had she been scheduled that morning to deliver an important presentation to the Board of Directors of Memetic Solutions , but now the infuriating yet attractive Stingo Strine had shown up on her office doorstep . His humble attitude , literally cap in hand , failed to mollify Parrish . Not only was she irritable from the massed gazes of the Boardmembers on her legs rather than on her Power Point slides , but the memory of her first and only date with Strine still rankled . Last summer , Parrish had promised to take her nephew Horace to a weekend Pawtucket Red Sox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston Sox , and usually put on a good show . Prior to the game , Horace had cajoled her into angling for an autograph from the Paw Sox 's pitcher , one Stingo Strine . The popular Strine was attempting a comeback after complicated shoulder surgery , a comeback that would soon prove impossible . But on that day he was still cocky and confident . Horace had led his aunt to the lowest tier of stadium seats . From this vantage , fans could dangle balls and pens down via plastic pails on ropes to the players as they entered onto the field . Spotting Strine , Horace had begun yelling the pitcher 's name and jagging his lure like an overanxious fisherman . Strine had been ready to walk past the offered baseball until he looked up and spotted Parrish . Smiling broadly , he took the ball and scribbled something across it , then trotted out onto the field . Gleefully , Horace hauled up his prize . He studied the ball and a confused expression clouded his face . " Auntie Parrish , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had indeed autographed it . But he had also included the comment " Pitchers do it until they get relief , " and his phone number . After her indignation had faded , Parrish inexplicably found herself experiencing a growing interest in this arrogant ballplayer . Did he think he was propositioning a married woman ? Did he care ? His performance that day , pitching several respectable innings despite obvious pain , also intrigued her . After returning Horace to his parents , Parrish called the number on the ball . Next weekend Strine arrived at her house in a vintage Mustang . He would n't tell her where they were going . With good reason , for their destination proved to be a strip club named Captains Curvaceous , " popular with all the hip guys on the team . " The evening went downhill from there , culminating in a short wrestling match in the Mustang which made Parrish feel as if she had somehow vaulted back to 1965 . Several calls from Strine afterward had earned him nothing but the blast of receiver smashing into cradle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But intrinsically changed ? Parrish had her doubts . Before she could order him out , Strine launched into an obviously well-rehearsed speech . " Professor Maxfield , I just want you to know that I 'm here for professional reasons , not personal ones . But before I get into the nature of my visit , I 'd just like to apologize for my treatment of you last year . I was under a lot of stress then , physical and emotional , and I was hooked on pain meds too . I realize that 's not an excuse , but I just wanted you to know where my head was at then . It was a crummy place to be , and you stepped right into it . But things have changed for me since then . " " Oh , yeah ? How ? Did you get traded to a Little League team ? " Strine winced . " No , I left the game entirely . I finally admitted to myself that my pitching career was over , without ever getting to the majors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think I 'm better off now . " Parrish felt bad , despite her ire . Maybe she had misjudged this guy . " So , what are you doing now ? " Strine put his cap back on and took out a business card . Parrish took it , read it , and was stunned . " Private investigator ? " " It was my uncle 's firm . He took me in full-time last year just before he retired . I used to help him during the off-season , so I had a pretty good grasp of the business . " " And a case brings you here to me now ? " Strine pulled up a chair and leaned forward earnestly . He recounted the whole story of the Merchants " Trust robbery , concluding , " So the only thing I could come up with is , this guy 's using some radical , unknown kind of mind-control device . And then I remembered that was your field . " Indeed , during various nervous moments of that awful evening Parrish had babbled about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had penetrated against the competing assaults of lap dances and jello-wrestling by bimbos with more silicone in them than a Home Depot caulking aisle . It was a miracle that Strine had remembered her end of the conversation , such as it was . " Well , I would n't call what we do here at Memetic Solutions " mindcontrol . " Although we are studying the way various ideas can colonize people 's minds . But , yes , there are certain applications .... " Despite her resolve not to get involved with any aspect of Strine 's life , Parrish found herself becoming professionally interested . " Summarize for me again what the robber did . " " He convinced an innocent honest kid to steal from his employer and then forget all about it . It was almost like he temporarily stole the kid 's consciousness , or bypassed it entirely . " Parrish frowned . " Bypass - No , it could n't be - " " What ? Tell me ! You onto something ? " Parrish stood up and began to pace . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me - what do you know about modern theories of consciousness ? " " About as much as you know about pitching . " " Well , let me see if I can bring you up to speed . One of the most radical new theories about how our brains work maintains that the self you imagine to be in control of your mind - the structure you might think of as your ego or consciousness - is simply a shallow mask over much deeper processes . And it is these processes which determine our behaviors . " Strine scowled . " You 're telling me we 're all zombies or puppets ? I do n't buy that . " " Oh , but in a way , we are . That is , if you insist on identifying only with these facades . But if you chose to displace your sense of self deeper - well then , there 's no problem . " " So you say . " Parrish felt rhetorical fire building , her typical reaction to encountering disagreement . " Look , any seemingly reasoned actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulate , any likes or dislikes you characterize as quintessentially " you " - none of these actually originate in the outer levels of your brain . None of them are a result of the supposedly rational chains of reasoning you can observe , which are in reality always constructed after the fact . They all flow from the depths upward . Even sensory impressions are not permitted to be acknowledged by the mask of consciousness unless the lower levels first select them and pass them on - a process called " outing . ' " Strine 's face reflected the contortions he was going through whiletrying to internalize this re-ordering of existence . " What about free will then ? " " Oh , you 've still got free will . It just does n't reside where you imagined it did . " Strine pondered this , then finally said , " It 's like the Wizard of Oz . " " Huh ? " " You remember . Everyone thinks Oz is this big glowing head . But Oz is really a little guy pulling levers in a hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the glowing head has some semblance of fake autonomy and believes that it 's really running things . " Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain , " the head says on its own , and believes it ! We call this face of Oz " Level One , " the aspect of your mind that imagines it runs things . Level One is a two-dimensional skin , without actual free will . Level Two is analogous to the subconscious , the deep three-dimensional realm where all the important things get hashed out . And the Central Executive Structure is the intermediary between them , the mechanism that selects what will be outed . Level One simply performs and believes whatever the Central Executive Structure sends it . And Level One has no direct access to the workings of Level Two . " Strine lifted his cap and brushed a hand across his bald strip . Parrish thought the humble gesture rather charming . " Man , this is your job , to sit here all day and think up this weird stuff ? And I thought my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything marketable out of this kind of blue-sky stuff ? " " Well , admittedly , the hypothesis I just outlined has stalled at the theoretical level . I myself have moved on to other areas of research . But there was one guy here who just would n't let go of this paradigm . A real fanatic . He kept pushing and pushing , claiming that he was learning the " protocols " of the Central Executive Structure and the " grammar " of Level Two . He said his goal was to insert orders into Level Two , which would then be transmitted through the CES and manifest as programmed actions in the subject . He actually got some intriguing results . But he refused to take new direction from the Board , and eventually he got fired . " Standing excitedly , Strine said , " A mad scientist with a grudge . That 's perfect ! What 's his name ? " Before Parrish could answer , her intercom bleeped . " Doctor Maxfield , Ron Fewsmith is here to see you . " ADJUSTING THE DRAPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Maxfield 's office . He pictured himself as the quiet yet deadly protagonist of the Coen Brothers " The Man Who Was n't There , going to his fateful interview with his wife 's lover . How often had he passed through this door , eager to share his latest findings with his beautiful co-worker , only to be shot down like a lovestruck duck falling for a decoy ? For that was what Maxfield was : a cold , hard , wooden imitation of the woman he needed her to be . She had derided both his timid overtures of undying love and his scientific discoveries . Thank goodness he had fallen in with Willadean , strict though she was ! At least Willadean cared for him ! True , the difference between the two women was like the difference between Veronica Lake and Christina Ricci . But now the invincible Professor Maxfield would pay for years of insults with her glamorous body , which luckily did not share the hardened nature of her mind . A mind completely amenable to whatever Fewsmith chose to insert within it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Maxfield would retain no memory of his visit . He did not want to endure her contempt even for one embarrassing minute that would later be wiped from her mental record . Fewsmith strode boldly into the dragon 's den . But he was brought up short by the unexpected presence of another person , standing at some remove from Maxfield and her desk . The stranger was a largish , hulking , low-browed type . Obviously not a fellow scientist , but probably one of the janitors here to replace a lightbulb . Or , at a stretch , a phone technician perhaps . Although the man held no tools - No matter , he 'd be easy to dismiss . " Hello , Parrish . It 's good to see you again . " " I do n't wish I could say the same , Ron . What do you want ? " " I 'm here to share something of vast importance with you , Parrish . A discovery so enormous that it will revolutionize life as we know it . But I can only tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can spill anything you want to tell me in front of my colleague here , Professor Strine . " Fewsmith narrowed his eyes on the stranger . Was that ridiculous cap he wore advertising a sports team ? " Professor Strine ? Really ? I do n't believe I 've ever seen any of your papers before in the customary journals . " The fellow glared back . " I only publish in , ah , foreign ones . " The man was a buffoon . Fewsmith had no idea what connection Strine bore to Parrish Maxfield , but he was plainly a trivial nuisance . Strine would be easily disposed of once Maxfield had gotten her dose of erotic instructions . " Oh , that explains it then . Pardon me . Very well , I 'll be happy to let both of you in on my discovery . You first , Parrish . Just take a look here . " Fewsmith unlimbered his PDA and held it in front of Maxfield 's eyes . He triggered the sequence intended specifically for her , and in one short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated her Level Two . Fewsmith stepped back and keyed up the general-purpose immobilizing sequence he had once intended to use on the bank guard . " Now it 's your turn , Professor Strine . " But Strine did not react as expected . Instead , he leaped upon Fewsmith and began struggling for control of the Palm Pilot . The two men careened around the office clumsily , tumbling over chairs and dislodging books from the bookcase , until Strine finally wrested the PDA away . Sweating , frightened and disheveled , Fewsmith staggered back against the outer door , fumbling for the handle . Grinning nastily , Strine advanced on him . But then a long low moan interrupted , and both men found their attention drawn to Doctor Parrish Maxfield . She had stripped off all her clothes and stood writhing and fondling herself like Pamela Anderson at a satyrs " convention . Strine froze , and the naked professor hurled herself upon the detective , the closest male available , in order to satisfy the script she was running . Fewsmith used the opportunity to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting Strine to collar him at any moment . But the man never appeared , and , out in the parking lot , Fewsmith slowed , panting . He could safely assume that his pursuer had his hands full . After all , those routines he had scripted - sexual exercises whose delights Strine was even now usurping from their rightful recipient ! were enough to keep any man busy . Even if the lucky , damnable bastard was trying to escape them ! The only suitable covering to cloak a naked woman available at Memetic Solutions proved to be a large silver mylar sheet from one of the animal testing labs , where semiotic simians passed primitive memes back and forth in controlled circumstances . Wrapped up like a baked potato in foil , Professor Parrish Maxfield sat on an office chair next to her pile of ripped and unsalvageable clothing . Her disarrayed hair framed an angry face . Her legs were crossed at the knees and one anomalously shod foot , suspended in midair , bobbed with furious impatience . Strine admired her composure . He doubted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sangfroid . Battling the amorous advances of the professor had taken all of Strine 's efforts . Luckily , the office door had slammed behind Fewsmith on his hasty way out , and no curious co-worker had intervened to witness the tussle . Dominated by the script Fewsmith had uploaded to her Central Executive Structure , Parrish had wrestled Strine to the floor . There , oblivious to his clothed state and lack of cooperation , she had enacted a variety of sexual situations , one posture after another , her face simulating all the requisite emotions and reactions , the appropriate repertoire of sounds and encouragements issuing from her lips . All Strine could do was to hold her tight and constrain her wild bucking so that she did not harm herself . Needless to say , wrestling thus with a naked woman - particularly one he had earlier fantasized about - caused no small degree of excitement in Strine 's own pelvic region , despite the bizarre and unwarranted nature of the attempted copulation . Before too long , Strine 's pants could have illustrated the tent pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the enforced simulation , her instant confusion and lack of immediate memories , her distress at suddenly finding herself naked-all these created a confusion that helped Strine conceal his problem until it had subsided . Strine had initially said , " Everything 's okay . Do n't worry . It was Fewsmith , but I stopped him . Wait here . " With a half-assed excuse he had convinced the curious but respectful receptionist of the urgent need for a covering of some sort , and , once the blanket was found , darted back into Parrish 's office . She wrapped herself up , and Strine explained everything to her . Parrish 's last memory ended with the receptionist announcing Fewsmith 's arrival . So far as Parrish knew , the man had never even entered her office . As the full implications of what she had just undergone hit her , Parrish Maxfield moved from a flushed embarrassment to rage . " That bastard ! He planned to use me like some kind of mindless sex toy ! Well , there 's no question now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hold on now a minute . This could be very dangerous . I do n't think you realize - " " Dangerous ? How could that little twerp be dangerous ? We 've got his gadget , do n't we ? " " Sure . But he must have another , or can get one fast . It 's just a Palm Pilot , after all . It 's these files that are deadly , and I 'm sure he 's got backups of those . " " Hand that over . " Strine gave Parrish the PDA . She jabbed at its buttons . " Do n't ! " " I 'm just bringing up the directory . Hmmm .... These file names are pretty cryptic . " Marching , " " Surrender , " " Handover ' .... Hard to tell what they do . " Something bothered Strine . " How can he construct and review these hypnotic routines without being affected by them himself ? " Parrish powered off the Palm Pilot and handed it back . " Oh , that 's simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then he must have learned about some command strings , such as one that informs the CES to disregard whatever follows . Kind of like stop and start and skip codons in DNA and protein replication . " " Um , if you say so . But still , I do n't feel you should , ah , expose yourself any further to this guy 's crazy nastiness . " " Ridiculous ! I 'm a big girl , and now I have my own score to settle with Mister Fewsmith . Besides , I can provide backup for you . " Strine considered . He was hardly averse to spending more time in the company of Professor Parrish Maxfield . " Okay . What 's our next step then ? " " First we get Fewsmith 's address from Human Resources . Then we 'll need to stop by my apartment for some clothes . " Parrish toggled the receptionist , and within minutes had the information they needed . " Um , do you want me to go to your place and bring the clothes back here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what people will think when they see me like this . Do you ? " Strine grinned broadly . " Actually , I 'd be flattered to be connected to your current condition , as long as you were smiling about it . " Parrish tried to look sober , but failed . Her wry grin made Strine desire her all the more . " Do n't get any funny ideas . This is strictly a business arrangement . " " Right . " Strine reminded himself that many business arrangements he had been involved in ended up in one or both parties getting screwed . The young receptionist 's hands stopped in mid-glide above her keyboard , and her eyes behind her funky glasses widened to dramatic dimensions . Holding her head high , Parrish strode by her with a curt , " I 'm taking the rest of the day off , Enid . " Half suspecting another attack by Fewsmith , Strine hovered protectively over Parrish until they were safely in his car . " Got rid of the Mustang , I see . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's too conspicuous for stakeouts and tailing people . " " Still , an old Buick with bodyrot is n't much of a babe magnet . " Strine sighed . " It came with the firm . My uncle-Jesus , I do n't know what kind of sex maniac you take me for ! Just because I tried to get in your pants once . " " Twice , counting today . " Strine grew angry . " Listen , honey , a different kind of guy would have jumped your bones while you were out of it without a qualm . " Parrish looked contrite . " That 's true . I apologize . I guess I 'm a little more distraught about what happened than I wanted to admit . " " Okay . Apology accepted . " " By the way - did you just use the word " qualm ? ' " " What 's the matter ? Ca n't a ballplayer - an ex-ballplayer - have a literate vocabulary ? " " Sure . But " qualm ? ' " " How about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Joyce scholar in juvenile headgear ! " Strine shrugged off the jab . " Being on the road most of the summer means you read a lot . " Parrish seemed done with teasing . She said nothing , but continued to study Strine until he actually grew uneasy . Once Parrish had dressed again , they headed across town to Fewsmith 's last-known home . On the way , Strine wanted to talk some more about this whole new way of regarding human awareness . " Despite everything I 've seen , I just ca n't quite believe our brains work the way you and Fewsmith claim they do . Like now , when I 'm talking with you . How can some shallow mechanical construct be formulating all this speech ? " " It 's not . Your Level One is just relaying rapidly formed sentences that have been outed by the CES from your Level Two region . " " I just ca n't buy that . " " That 's because one of the most vital artifacts of Level Two is a belief in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face for daily interactions . Look , where did you get that word " qualm " a minute ago ? Was it a conscious choice ? Could you have predicted even a millisecond ahead of time that you 'd use that word ? No , of course not . As Professor Jeffrey Grey says , " Consciousness occurs too late to affect the outcomes of the mental processes it 's apparently linked to . " Simply put , the Level One persona you imagine to be in charge is nothing more than a monomolecular film over the depths of your mind . Let me ask you this : who 's driving ? " " Huh ? " " Who 's driving the car right now while you 're talking with me ? Are you consciously steering and using the brake and the accelerator ? Or are subconscious routines handling everything , well below your Level One awareness ? " " But that 's just training and habit and , and - " Strine 's brain - every level - began to hurt . He stopped talking before he made it worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without any concierge , the premises offered little barrier to Strine 's expert skills : he awaited the entry of a resident and slipped in behind the unsuspecting fellow . Soon he and Parrish stood in front of Fewsmith 's apartment door . " What now ? " whispered Parrish . Strine placed an ear to the door . " I do n't think anyone 's home . I 'm going in . You willing to break the law ? " " Against this jerk ? Of course . " The interior of Fewsmith 's home - and it was definitely his , as revealed by some junk mail on a tabletop-was in wild disarray , revealing a hasty exit , possibly permanent . Dresser drawers had been left open , and a suitcase with a broken zipper lay discarded . " He 's split . Damn it ! Now how do we find him ? " Parrish held up a frilly slip . " Can you believe that creep was actually living with a woman ? What did he want with me then ? Just revenge ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Yeah , right , like that routine he zapped me with even included foreplay . " Strine kicked angrily at the abandoned suitcase . " If only we could read those files without being forced to enact them ! They might give us a clue . Say , maybe I could put myself through them , and you could take notes and try to guess what each one represented ... ? " Parrish pondered this suggestion . " No , too iffy . How could we be sure what real-world action was represented by some odd set of calisthenics ? And what if some routines were meant to inflict harm on the subject or on others ? No , we need to be able to review the routines harmlessly , just as Fewsmith does - Wait a minute ! I know someone who might be able to do just that ! " " Let 's go then ! " On the way to the car Strine asked , " Who is this person ? Another scientist ? " " No , she 's my guru , Kundalini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stare at Parrish . BUSY DAYDREAMING about her new life to come back in Pine Mountain-she had just shocked all the mousy women at the church social with her chic clothes and big-city ways for the hundredth time - Willadean was unprepared for the alarming entrance of her frustrated lover-in-name-only . Fewsmith 's mild face was reddened with consternation and exertion . His flyaway hair resembled a badly groomed Shih Tzu 's . He was huffing and puffing and it took him a few seconds to get his words out . " They know it 's me ! They know it 's me ! " Willadean jumped up , instantly tense and infuriated . " Who knows about you ? Out with it , peckerhead ! What happened ? " Fewsmith recounted the fiasco in Parrish Maxfield 's office . Willadean relaxed just a little when he finished his tale . " Okay , let 's look at this objectively like . You show this scientist gal your little computer screen and she gets all sexed-up and goes into heat . Then the stranger starts brawling with you . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How 's any of this connect you to the bank job ? Your old flame ai n't gon na remember nothing , and the guy who whomped you do n't know you from Adam 's uncle . " " But why did he jump me so fast ? Maxfield had n't even had time to react to the instructions , but he was on me ! It was as if he recognized what I was doing . That 's the only explanation . The cops have already been to visit them , seeking their help , and they were warned in advance of what I could do . " Willadean glowered . " You know , you just might be right for once . Okay , we ca n't take any chances . We 're gon na have to go for the big score right now . To heck with any more planning ! Luckily we 've still got a few hours until the armored car pickup at five . Meanwhile , we pack up a few things right away , load our car , and cruise around till five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hit the road with no one the wiser . Are you sure the guards pick up a million dollars every day ? " Fewsmith seemed to be regaining a little composure . " At least . " He went to his desk on which sat a PC , unlocked a desk drawer and removed a second Palm Pilot . He cabled it into the bigger machine . " You start packing . I need to download a few routines . It 's all prime material , derived from several exemplary films , including a segment from one very fatal thriller for anyone who crosses us this time . In fact , I just hope that guy who was in Maxfield 's office shows up again ! I 'll settle his hash ! " Willadean patted the scrawny shoulders of her meal-ticket . " That 's the way to talk , tiger . But do n't forget my part just cause you 've got a hardon to get your revenge . Where 's that tape I need ? " Fewsmith dug out a standard videotape cassette . " Here you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as your dinky computer thing ? " An exasperated sigh gave evidence that Fewsmith 's temper was still not in equilibrium . " Of course ! I take control of people through their visual systems . It does n't matter how the instructions are delivered . They could come through a flip book if you could flip the pages fast enough ! No , there 's nothing to worry about on that end . But are you sure you can get into the control room ? " Willadean bumped Fewsmith with her bountiful hip , almost sending him staggering . " Did n't I spend a couple of months already cozying up to this bird ? He 's already let me in once while he was alone on duty , and we tore us off a - I mean , we had us some smooching . " Fewsmith looked forlorn . " Willadean , if I thought you were giving your favors out left and right to everyone but me - " Enveloping the smaller man in her capacious bosom , Willadean said , " Aw , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so goddamn annoying , she thought . Parrish felt a little guilty intruding on Kundalini Glastonbury at this hour . Glastonbury conducted a lunchtime session of astral travel instruction for busy office workers who could n't attend her nighttime classes . Then , from one to two , the guru locked her classroom door and took her own vegan lunch , followed by a session of meditation and pranayama breathing to get herself centered for the rest of her equally busy afternoon . And now here Parrish blew in , interrupting her spiritual guide 's only private time . But such impoliteness could n't be helped if they were tocatch Fewsmith before the renegade memetician could subject anyone else to his mind games . On the drive over , Strine had quizzed Parrish with genuine curiosity about her outre spiritual practices . He seemed baffled at the seeming incongruity with her scientific side . Finally Parrish had gotten exasperated . " Listen , nothing says science has all the answers about the universe . Have n't you ever heard of " hidden variables ' ? " " No . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe that exist down below any level we can observe , and which would explain all the seeming inconsistences of modern physics and other disciplines . I 'm a firm believer in them . And my teacher helps me access that side of existence . " Strine snorted . " Fairies . Elves . And I thought ballplayers were superstitious . " Parrish folded her arms across her chest . " All we care about now is results , not how we get them . At least give Kundalini a chance . " " Was n't that a John Lennon song ? " " Jerk ! " It took Glastonbury several minutes to respond to their insistent knocking . But at last she appeared , a petite woman with a mop of tight blonde curls and startling eyes like chips of Arizona sky , wearing a worn green leotard that had plainly seen many a backbend . Seeing only Strine at first , Glastonbury scowled . " Mister , this had better be the number one crisis of the last ten kalpas - " But when Parrish stepped forward , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interrupt your private time , but we desperately need your help . " " Come in , dear , come in . " Glastonbury was brought up to speed in only minutes . Unlike Strine , she easily accepted Parrish 's paradigm of human mentality as conforming to facts she already knew under another guise . " I think I can handle these deviant instructional blasts , " said the small woman with utmost confidence . " They 're just like intrusions by Tibetan dons into the alaya level of consciousness . " Not for the first time , Parrish found herself wondering just how old Glastonbury was . " I 'll disconnect my mind from my body entirely . The routines might run internally , but they wo n't make it past my temporary barrier . But tell me this : what am I looking for ? " Strine , who had been impolitely rolling his eyes at this talk , said , " Except for his vindictiveness against Ms. Maxfield , Fewsmith seems motivated mainly by money . So we 're after something like the trick he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Very well . Just give me about five minutes to prepare myself . Then you can start showing me the movies . " Glastonbury did not assume a full lotus , but rather reclined on her back on the floor , her muscles going slack . " The corpse position , " whispered Parrish . After allowing the stipulated time to pass , Parrish positioned herself to hold the PDA above Glastonbury 's open eyes . Then , one by one , she launched the various mental-subversion files . Aside from a few minor twitches , Glastonbury exhibited no effects from watching the preemptive commands . Apparently her Level Two and CES had been completely snipped out of the motor loop . " Jesus , " said Strine , " I never would 've thought it possible - " Parrish paused long enough to spare her partner a gloating smile . Finally the directory was exhausted . Parrish handed the demonic device back to Strine , and he stuck it in a back pocket . The investigators sat back for several minutes while Glastonbury came out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a three-day-workout with Mister Iyengar 's evil twin ! This technology is absolutely perverted , Parrish . I trust you 'll make sure it does not spread . " " Yes , mahatma . " " C'm on , c'm on ! Any leads ? Do you recall anything that could help us ? " Glastonbury fixed a penetrating gaze on Strine and said , " Before I gaze into my crystal ball , you must cross the gypsy 's palm with silver . " Strine had his wallet out but stopped when the two women began to giggle . Chagrined , he repocketed his cash and finally joined them in laughter . When they had finished chuckling , Glastonbury said , " There 's one image that seems relevant . I saw people pointing to a giant television screen mounted on a building . Then the screen began showing them what to do . Money was involved somehow . But the rest of the details are hazy . My Level Two is n't much more forthcoming than yours , I 'm afraid , after those unnatural assaults . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then - that screen 's freestanding . It 's got to be that bigscreen unit down in Blackmore Square . It 's the only one in town . Let 's go ! " Glastonbury made a bow to usher them out , which Parrish returned . Give Strine credit : he tried to copy the elegant gestures of the women , despite ending up , thought Parrish , looking rather like a bobble-head dashboard figurine . WAITING NERVOUSLY a few feet away from the parked Wells Fargo truck in Blackmore Square , Ron Fewsmith examined the bandages wrapping his left hand . Bulkier than required by any unswollen appendage , the wrappings concealed his deadly Palm Pilot , leaving the screen exposed . Wary of flashing his instrument of coercion - surely the police would be watching for just such a move after the bank heist Fewsmith had conceived of this concealment . Additionally , the sympathy generated by the sight of the bandages should help focus the attention of his victims on the display . Fewsmith felt confident of his ultimate success , despite his jitters . Had he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auteurs ? A shouted command from the old Superman TV show ; some images from the sci-fi masterpiece Strange Days ; crowd scenes from Cotton Comes to Harlem - What more would he need ? Once Willadean succeeded in launching these subversive images upon the giant flatscreen mounted on the Berkeley Building - the mosaic of panels was now occupied by the feed from CNN-a carefully planned chaos would erupt , during which time Fewsmith would hijack the entire contents of the armored car , easily a million or more in unmarked cash . He and Willadean would rendezvous at their vehicle , then make good their escape . Images of a naked , supplicating Willadean - fabricated solely from Fewsmith 's imagination - swarmed his vision , distracting him for a moment from his fixity of purpose . If at this advanced stage of their relationship she still refused to let him have his way with her , then she 'd find herself dumped on the side of the highway . Let her even go revengefully to the authorities and try to strike a plea bargain , if she wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could become invisible at will . All he needed to do was immerse himself in some pleasant Mexican village , say , then program all the inhabitants to deny his very existence when questioned . He could live like a potentate - with his own harem - on the proceeds of this day 's robbery , not to mention any future conquests . A far cry from the humble and demeaning researcher 's existence . Recalling his old life led Fewsmith to relive his humiliating experience in Parrish Maxfield 's office . He looked about the busy square for that hulking cretin who had assaulted him . Pedestrians thronged the sidewalks , nothing more than dismissable programmable robots , and traffic flowed in complicated patterns through the five-way nexus . No sight of that aggressive jerk though . But Fewsmith remained vigilant . Two guards trundled out a bag-laden trolley from the bank door beside which Fewsmith stood . The other two guards stationed by the rear of the Wells Fargo truck instantly came alert , weapons poised . At the same moment several bystanders shouted , " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting her tape to play . Fewsmith felt particularly proud of the sequence of commands now cycling over and over on the big TV . First he had included the comic-book-hero command to yell " Look ! " and to point at the screen . This insured that as soon as a few people were enraptured , the rest would quickly follow , obeying their natural instincts to follow a pointing finger . But the next set of commands was a stroke of genius . All around Fewsmith people began to take out their wallets and open their purses and throw their cash into the air . Cars screeched to a halt . The few citizens not captured by Fewsmith 's video began to dive after the flying dollars . As more people entered Blackmore Square they either became captivated by the money-throwing instructions or naturally fell to scooping up cash . Within moments , the scene resembled the arrival of U.N . food trucks at a refugee camp . Any police arriving now would have their hands full . The four Wells Fargo guards were well trained , huddling protectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves at eye-level . But they had n't counted on the nature of the second assault . Fewsmith triggered a blood squib in his bandages . Moaning in mock pain , he stumbled toward the uniformed men . " My hand , my hand ! Someone crushed my hand ! " The guards naturally looked down at Fewsmith 's bloody hand . There they viewed a vivid shifting collage of scenes from Groundhog Day , The Underneath , The Newton Boys , and even that awful remake of Dog Day Afternoon , Swordfish . They instantly stiffened . Fewsmith said , " Follow me . " Two guards began to push the trolley while the other two marched ahead like slave automatons to clear a path . Fewsmith chortled once his car came into sight . Parked several blocks away in an alley that led conveniently out of the traffic congestion , the getaway vehicle was just as he had left it . And there stood his woman by the car . " Willadean , " Fewsmith called out . The woman turned . Parrish Maxfield . Strine drove like Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six blocks away . Already early confusing reports of trouble there had erupted from the car radio . " We 've got to stop the dissemination of the blipvert first , " Strine said . " Then we can try to nab Fewsmith . " " Blipvert ? " " Sure , that 's what these things are . Do n't you remember Max Headroom ? " " Max whosis ? " Strine narrowed his eyes for a moment upon Doctor Parrish Maxfield before he had to swerve wildly to avoid a taxi stalled in their lane . " What were you doing about fifteen years ago ? " " I was twelve , and busy building molecular models with Legos . " " You 're that young ? " " You 're that old ? " " Forget it then . Just wait in the car while I go up to the control room . Good thing I was able to reach my uncle . He got the security codes and the location of the place from a buddy in the agency who installed their alarm system . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Fewsmith myself . I owe that bastard a good kick in the balls . " Strine thought his head would explode . " You will not ! It 's too dangerous ! " " Who the hell are you ? My nanny ? Besides , I 've got the perfect defense against Ronnie and his primitive toy . Now , if he had learned to program Level Two and the CES with sonics or haptics , we 'd be in trouble . He would have been able to take over someone with a sound or a touch . Hmmm , I wonder if prior instances of this discovery formed the basis for a few legends ? The Sirens , the Old Man of the Sea - " " Forget all that . Besides , what kind of defense can you have ? You have to look at him to nab him , and then he 's got you . " Parrish patted her purse . " Do n't you worry your little Level One about me . My secret weapon 's safe in here . " Abandoning any attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Strine concentrated on getting them as close as possible to the civic uproar in Blackmore Square . When they finally had to ditch their car , they were only a block away . Strine began to trot toward the Berkeley Building , Parrish following gamely along . " Do n't look up ! " " Do you take me for an idiot ? " Darting around the mad masses of money-flingers and money-graspers , avoiding rogue cars in motion whose drivers had decided to take to the sidewalks , the pair ended up at the door of the Berkeley Building . " There 's Fewsmith ! " exclaimed Parrish , pointing across the turbulent streetscene . " He 's got some kind of entourage pushing a trolley and he 's moving slow . I 'll recognize his getaway car when I see it , and I think if I anticipate his vector I can beat him to it without him seeing me . " " No , do n't , " Strine said . But Parrish had already hotfooted off . Strine hesitated a second , thinking to follow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for casualties determined his course of action , and he raced inside the building . Safe behind the locked door of the control room , the unsuspecting horny technician knocked out cold upon the floor , Willadean Lawes surveyed the scene outside the tenth-floor window with immense satisfaction . She could spot the tiny figures of Fewsmith and the guards moving safely but slowly away from the armored car . Once her partner was definitely out of the chaos , she would leave behind the controls of the no-longer necessary bigscreen and hook up with him . But till then , she 'd guard the room so that no one could halt the projection . Polishing a small silver pistol on the cloth molding her pretty rump , Willadean thought of how best to dispose of Fewsmith , and when . Maybe after they got out of the country . Let him do all the driving , get exhausted and clumsy , and then he 'd be good as dead . Sure , she 'd lose the expertise with the gadget contained within his cooling brain , but who cared ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . And she could be the belle of Baja as easily as the princess of Pine Mountain . A solenoid latch clicked , and the outer door swung inward . Willadean trained her pistol on whoever was entering . The intruder was a rough-edged , good-looking bruiser . Willadean felt her heart go thump-a-thump . Maybe this guy was another crook , out to share the score . If so , Willadean might have herself a new partner . The guy 's words broke Willadean 's illusion . " Okay , I 'm guessing you must be Fewsmith 's woman . Better throw in the towel now , before anyone gets hurt . Your buddy 's already captured . " Willadean risked a quick glance out the window and saw no confirmation of this joker 's threat . She laughed . " Good try , pal . I was born on a Saturday , but not last Saturday . Now I think I 'll measure you for a clay cabin . " " Wait ! I 've got something you want ! " Willadean 's trigger finger eased back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy moved his hand slowly to his rear pocket and came up with a Palm Pilot . " Just this ! " he said , mashing a button . Willadean tried to avert her eyes , but it was too late . The sound of breaking glass was followed before too long by a muffled thump from street level . Strine let loose a gust of relief . " I thought that was what " defenestration " meant ! " THE MESMERIZED GUARDS halted when Fewsmith did , standing like toy soldiers in the Nut-cracker . Parrish felt a brief surge of fear , thinking she 'd become the target of their rifles . But apparently Fewsmith had not written that routine into the command set he had instilled earlier in them . An obnoxious leer overspread the rogue scientist 's face , and Parrish felt her fear displaced by cold anger against this little weasel . " Well , well , well - if it 's not the dull-witted Doctor Maxfield . Have you dropped by to see if you can co-author a paper with me ? If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Fewsmith gloated , Parrish slinked her fingers into the purse slung from her shoulder . She knew she 'd have to goad him into using the Palm Pilot and then match his actions precisely . " I would n't want my name in the same journal as yours . You 've warped an important discovery for selfish personal gain . Why , you 're no better than that Frenchman who claimed to have discovered N-rays ! " Bristling at this vile scientific insult , Fewsmith raised his bandaged hand . " I think I 'll let you have the fate I intended for your big dumb boyfriend . Look away if you want , but then of course I 'll simply escape . " Parrish had her trump card in her fingers , held nearly out of her purse . " Do your worst ! I 'm not afraid . And he 's not dumb ! " Fewsmith triggered his deadly sequence just as Parrish whipped her mirror into place , shielding her own eyes . A look of utter horror flashed over Fewsmith 's face , as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Go , An Affair to Remember , City on the Edge of Forever , and The Laughing Dead . Then he was darting out into the street , looking frantically about for a moving car . Spotting a racing ambulance , he hurled himself beneath its wheels . Once again Parrish turned her eyes aside in time to miss the worst . * * * The cessation of the command sequence on the big public screen resulted in a gradual diminishment of the chaos in Blackmore Square , as the cycle of infection and reinfection ground to a halt , and even the most recently commandeered minds resumed their normal functioning . Trotting back to the center of the outbreak , alongside the incoming flood of EMTs , policemen , firemen , National Guard troopers and reporters , Parrish knew then that Strine must have succeeded , and she experienced a little surge of pride in his accomplishments . The emotion took her by surprise , but her flexible intellect smoothly integrated the new feelings into her estimate of the man . The crowd of stunned , disoriented , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as someone bulled through the mass . Parrish caught sight of a bobbing baseball cap and sped up to meet the detective . Spotting her , Strine raced to her side . He hugged her , and she returned the gesture . But then he released her , a sober look replacing his joy at finding her unharmed . " We 're going to have some serious explaining to do , once they make the inevitable connection between us and Fewsmith , so we 'd better get our story straight . " " What do you mean ? " " Just look around you ! The two people who caused this disaster are both dead - apparent suicides , luckily - but the cops will still want to know how they did it . " Parrish pondered the matter . " I think we should tell them Ron bragged to us about some sort of novel aerosol CBW agent . They 'll discount the bigscreen images as just visual noise meant to distract the bank guards . Anything but the reality . Fewsmith 's discovery is too dangerous to release . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set up by some madman conversant in the grammar of Level Two ? No , much as it pains my scientific soul to say it , this knowledge has to be expunged . " " But how ? " " I saw Fewsmith 's Palm Pilot crushed under the ambulance . That leaves yours and the videotape from the control room . I assume you took the tape ? Good ! Give them to me . " Strine complied , and Parrish hammered the Palm Pilot against a nearby hydrant till it shattered . With Strine 's help , she cracked the video case and unspooled the tape down a sewer grating . " Now we race to Fewsmith 's home before the cops even figure out the address , then erase any traces of his invention we find there . Et voila , the world is saved ! " Strine looked at her admiringly . " You do n't have any desire to take over Fewsmith 's invention and run with it ? This could mean a Nobel Prize for you . It was only Fewsmith 's greed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Nuh-huh ! I 'm not strong enough to resist the temptation . Are you ? " Strine appeared to be considering the matter . " Well , there are a few things I 'd change . " " Like what ? " " Well , the attitude of a certain beautiful woman toward a certain exballplayer named Stingo Strine . " Parrish smiled . " No need to use a machine . Consider it done . " " Really ? " " On the level . " Sidebar COMING ATTRACTIONS NEXT MONTH 'S ISSUE should be an interesting one .
