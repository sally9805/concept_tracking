For a moment all was silence in the darkened living room . Then came a thump . " Ouch ! " said a small voice . " Drat again ! " " Are you a burglar ? " Arthur called . " Did you hurt yourself ? " " I am not a burglar ! " said the voice . " Where 's the  --  Ah ! " The lights came on . The brothers stared .
