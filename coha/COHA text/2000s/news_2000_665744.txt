<p> In a major setback for the international space station , the launch of a key module will be delayed yet again after flaws were detected in a booster rocket , a top official said today . <p> The launch of the station 's crew module wo n't be possible until at least August , Sergei Gromov , spokesman for the Energia Company which built the module , told The Associated Press . <p> The launch of the module , called Zvezda ( Star ) , had already been delayed 18 months , causing major delays for the whole project . <p> The delay was necessary because engineers detected faults in the manufacture of the Proton booster rocket , which is to put the Zvezda module into orbit , Gromov said . The rocket manufacturer must replace faulty parts , expected to be done by the end of June , he said . <p> " Once the booster is ready , it takes about 45 days to prepare the module for launch , so the earliest launch time is the end of August , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setbacks blamed on Russia for the $60 billion station , which has been described as humanity 's outpost in space for the 21st century . Sixteen countries participate in the project . <p> Russia is playing a leading role in the construction of the station , with the United States supplying much of the funding . <p> Gromov said a new launch date will be discussed at a meeting in Moscow next month . He said some software problems with Zvezda 's computers also must be resolved before launch . <p> " Obviously , the Americans are not pleased with the delay , but they react with understanding , " he said . <p> Russian officials began an investigation after two Proton rockets crashed in July and October , sending debris and chemicals raining down on the Baikonur space station in Kazakstan . <p> Investigators determined Tuesday that dust particles contaminated the second stage engines , the news agency Interfax reported .

The Zvezda ( Star ) module is to be carried into space by a Proton . <p> Sergei Gromov , spokesman for the Energia company that built the module , said the crashes were caused by a manufacturing flaw in the rockets ' second-stage engines . The Voronezh Mechanical Works , which built the engines , promised to replace them by the end of June , he told The Associated Press . <p> " Once the booster is ready , it takes about 45 days to prepare the module for launch , so the earliest launch time is the end of August , " he said .

He said that some software problems with Zvezda 's computers also must be resolved before the launch . <p> " Obviously , the Americans are not pleased with the delay , but they react with understanding , " he said . <p> Two Proton rockets crashed shortly after launch July 5 and Oct. 27 . The official investigation released by the Interfax news agency Tuesday said the engines caught fire because they were contaminated by metal and mineral particles . <p> While the new international station faced new delays , Russia 's own Mir space station may remain in orbit for longer than earlier planned , officials said . <p> The government decided last year to discard the aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it aloft .

Their mission would last for at least 45 days . <p> Gromov said the state-controlled Energia , which built the Mir and has been running it since its launch in February 1986 , is looking to a U.S. company named Golden Apple to save Mir .
