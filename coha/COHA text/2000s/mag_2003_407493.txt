Light Camera , Action 3 TRAILWORTHY DIGITAL CAMERAS PLUS 4 DO-IT-ALL SHOES Your grandma uses a digital camera . So does your kid . Why should you get one ? Instant gratification : The moment you arrive home , you can e-mail a glory shot of summit day to your buddy who bailed on the trip . And a lighter load : Snap an album 's worth of quality pics without lugging heavy lenses and a bag full of film . But before you blow a buck on a bunch of megapixels , make sure you pick a trailworthy model . Most are impractical for treks longer than a few days , because they run only on short-lived rechargeable batteries . Last spring in the Rockies , I tested three digital cameras that use both off-the-shelf batteries for extended field time and rechargeables . Each model offers more sophistication ( zoom , close-ups within a couple inches , movies , manual controls ) than beginner point-and-shoots . Prices quoted are street averages .

THE LIGHTEST FULL-FEATURED CAMERA WE 'VE SEEN If Ansel Adams had been born in the digital age , this 7-ounce wonder would have made him a believer . The compact ( 3.4 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches ) number slips easily into a cargo pocket , yet has enough bells and whistles to thrill an expert , including black-and-white and sepia modes , plus image cropping right on the LCD screen . For point-and-shooters , the Coolpix features four assist modes to help you compose professional images and 10 scene modes to simplify tricky lighting . Despite its diminutive size , the camera has surprisingly large controls , making it easy to operate even with my big , gloved hands on a backcountry ski trip . It 's not the best choice for aspiring movie-makers ( no sound , 15-second limit ) , and the lightweight plastic body does n't inspire the drop-me-anywhere confidence of the metal models . The 2 megapixel resolution is fine for passable 8-by-10-inch prints and personal Web sites , but for finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is identical but has an extra megapixel for $100 more .

UPGRADE YOUR CAMERA WITHOUT SINKING YOUR CREDIT RATING . Do n't wrap your palm around this solid bundle of electronics until you 're ready to buy . You may not want to let go . It 's small enough to operate one-handed , yet packs a big dollop of digital bravado into its 11 ounces . Beneath the aluminum alloy body , which survived a 4-foot drop onto a rock unscathed , you 'll find photographer-friendly features like a focus assist light , sepia tones , contrast/color enhancer , and soft focus . The PowerShot is a little larger than the Coolpix , but one reason is the extra batteries ( four AAs instead of two ) , which means that you get more than twice as many shots per battery change . And for would-be directors , this little powerhouse can shoot movies with sound up to 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality reproduction and cost , but if 2 megapixels will suffice , save $100 and choose the A60 .

It 's pricier and heavier than the other two , but you get a lot in return : A magnesium body offers superb handling and toughness , 5 megapixels deliver excellent reproduction , and the camera has every function a photo hound could want . First and foremost is a fast lens ( F1.8-2.6 ) . It adds bulk , but performs superbly in low light conditions and allows better portraits .
