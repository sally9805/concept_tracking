<p> Washington  --  Defying President Bush , the Senate on Wednesday approved a bill  --  similar to one he vetoed in September  --  to provide federal funding for embryonic stem cell research . <p> This time , however , senators also approved an alternative bill authored by Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R-Ga. ) that Bush said he would sign . <p> Approved 70-28 , Isakson 's measure , dubbed the Hope Act , would provide federal funding only for research on stem cells taken from so-called " naturally dead " embryos  --  those too deficient to produce a child if implanted . His bill is intended to address critics ' main objection : that taking stem cells from viable embryos destroys the embryos , an act they equate with taking a human life . <p> " It 's a big step forward , " Isakson said after the vote . " Now we have a bill with a clean chance of getting to the White House that the administration said they would not veto . " <p> But he acknowledged that the future of his bill is cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill approved earlier this year in the House , and it is those measures on which the House and Senate will negotiate to reach a final version of the bill . Isakson said he is now looking for sponsors for his legislation in the House , where it would have to be approved before it could become law . <p> The other stem cell bill , favored by the Democratic leadership , received more support Wednesday than it did last fall , including the backing of 17 Republicans . But it is still four votes shy of the number needed to overturn a veto . <p> Sen. Tom Harkin ( D-Iowa ) urged Bush to reconsider his stand , which is at odds with what polls show is strong public support for embryonic stem cell research as a potential route to cures . <p> But Bush , in a statement , said his veto threat stands . <p> " This bill crosses a moral line that I and many others find troubling , " he said . <p> At the same time , Bush again expressed support for Isakson 's bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send it to me for my signature so stem cell science can progress without ethical and cultural conflict , " he said . <p> Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R-Ga. ) backed Isakson 's bill . He called it " an effective way to provide for advancements in science and give hope to those who are waiting for cures without compromising the value of life . " <p> With Bush 's backing , Isakson offered his bill as a compromise between those hoping to expand funding for embryonic stem cell research and those who object to the destruction of human embryos . <p> But Democrats and some scientists say Isakson 's proposal  --  based on the research of University of Georgia scientist Steven Stice  --  is impractical and unlikely to help create any new treatments or cures . <p> Democrats asserted that Isakson 's bill was intended only to provide political cover so that Republicans can appear to be supporting embryonic stem cell research without offending religious conservatives . <p> Isakson defended his bill . Bush in 2001 restricted federal funding for embryonic stem cell research , limiting it to 21 existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those lines were derived from naturally dead embryos  --  three of them produced by Stice . <p> To date , Isakson said , the National Institutes of Health have reported no significant differences between cells derived from a viable embryo and those taken from the dead embryos . <p> While opponents focused on moral issues , supporters of embryonic stem cell research say it should be encouraged because it shows promise in developing cures and therapies for diseases such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's . The Senate 's action was the latest act in a drama that blends science and politics on an issue that affects millions of people afflicted with such ailments . <p> " It 's extremely frustrating to go through this Kabuki dance a second time with the president , " said Peter Kiernan , head of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation , which funds research . " The one thing we know is , we will outlast him . " <p> Missouri became a testing ground last fall , as Claire McCaskill , a supporter of the research , defeated GOP Sen. Jim Talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox appeared in a television ad advocating greater research and the visual image was arresting , the 45-year-old actor swaying from Parkinson 's disease . <p> Advocates of the veto-threatened legislation argue that the number of stem cell lines available is smaller than needed , and that some of the material has become contaminated over time by mouse embryonic skin cells that typically are placed at the bottom of culture dishes used in the research . <p> The bill would permit funding for research on embryonic stem cells regardless of the date of their creation , so long as they were donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics that would otherwise discard them , and donors gave their approval . <p> With federal funding limited , several states and private institutions have moved into the void . <p> California , New York and New Jersey have programs . Gov . Deval Patrick of Massachusetts recently announced he hoped to overturn restrictions left in place by his Republican predecessor , Mitt Romney . <p> " We in Massachusetts increasingly see this as a competitive issue , " said Dr. George Daley of Children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private institutions compete to hire promising scientists drawn to the field . <p> But Carrie Gordon Earll , bioethics analyst at Focus on the Family , said that apart from the issue of embryo destruction , the inevitable result of the contested legislation would be to reduce funding available for adult stem cell work , which she said is more advanced . <p> " To our knowledge there are no clinical trials with human embryonic stem cells under way and there are 1,300 adult stem cell trials , " she said , adding , " The destruction of embryos is not necessary for the advancement of regenerative research , " she added . <p> The Associated Press contributed to this article .
