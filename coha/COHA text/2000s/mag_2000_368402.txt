Here is a soothing bit of perspective to consider the next time you are belted in on the runway and the captain announces , " We are 14th in line for takeoff . " Before 1869 , it could have taken the better part of a month for a stagecoach to make its way across the plains and over the mountains of North America . After 1869 , the time was cut to about one smoky , jolting week on the newly completed link known as the transcontinental railroad . <P> Nothing Like It in the World : The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869 ( Simon &; Schuster ; 431 pages ; $28 ) is Stephen E. Ambrose 's account of the visionaries who planned , financed and finagled the project , and the thousands of Civil War veterans and new immigrants who laid the tracks . <P> Ambrose , well known for his narratives of World War II and for Undaunted Courage , a fresh retelling of the Lewis and Clark Expedition , writes with a wide-open throttle : " Only in America was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America was there enough labor or enough energy and imagination . " Elsewhere the newly connected nation is described as " an empire of liberty running from sea to shining sea . " <P> It takes some kind of undaunted courage to write triumphalist history in an age of revisionism and rigid identity politics . America 's Industrial Revolution , once celebrated by statesmen and poets alike , differs markedly from a subject like World War II , with its clear consensus about good and evil . Ambrose 's latest saga is not a historical blame game played by today 's rules . Still , the author has more respect for the past than to pretend that the transcontinental railroad could have been built without financial corruption , treacherous working conditions , the blood and sweat of scoundrels and bigots , and the killing of Indians who fought the iron horsemen because their rails altered bison-migration patterns . <P> In his enthusiastic and briskly written 800-page Empire Express , published last year and now in a Penguin USA paperback edition , Middlebury College scholar David Haward Bain follows the money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly , the G.I. 's chronicler prefers the front lines , where he is at his best describing men , armed with only hand tools , hacking and scraping their way over 2,000 inhospitable miles . When black powder proved too slow in piercing mountain granite , more powerful but dangerously unstable nitroglycerin was used  --  even though that meant more blasters would die . <P> Calling on his skills as a military historian , Ambrose excels at moving from individual engagements to the big picture . He casts the 19th century 's most ambitious undertaking as a war fought on two fronts . Building from opposite directions , men of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific threw themselves at seemingly impregnable obstacles and rewrote the engineering textbook . In one feat , two teams boring toward each other through the Summit Tunnel in Nevada were off only two inches when they met . Adjusting for some patriotic windage and unedited repetitions , Ambrose 's latest rouser is also on the mark . <P>  --  By R.Z. Sheppard              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
