// Cleavage , baby ! All anybody wants is tits . Probably we went too far away from babes , until the Brits came and said enough p.c. - let 's have fun . Is n't it fun ? - E- mail from a veteran magazine editor ( not at Esquire ) answering a magazine journalist 's recent question , " What happened to this racket ? " I get so angry when I ca n't find a magazine that Heather Graham has just appeared in . Why does n't everyone agree with me on this . I agree with Heather Graham on so many different matters . I wonder where Heather Graham shops for clothes . Some people do n't care much for Heather Graham but I think that they are nuts ! ... I ca n't think of anyone more beautiful than Heather Graham . Everybody should be grateful to the parents of Heather Graham for bringing her into the world . I ca n't say this any louder . I do n't see why everyone does n't agree on this . . . . - From the Web site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get what you want about Heather Graham " ) HERE IN THE NEW WORLD OF MAGAZINE MAKING , it is a distinct pleasure to give you precisely what you want . It is a pleasure most distinct . For instance , the various persons who nowadays frequently appear on our covers without wearing very many clothes appear there for you and for people just like you . They know that you want them to appear there as much as we want them to , especially because you want them to . Often , these cover persons are photographed weeks before a writer is dispatched to divine their inner truths and tender secrets-that which becomes the nutmeat of the text ( this ) that accompanies photographs like the ones you may be noticing at present ( those ) . Such was the case with myself and the beautiful Miss Heather Graham ( her ) - or Heather Joan Graham , as her parents named her on January 29 , 1970 , when she arrived in life , about which you are , or should be , extremely grateful . I did not personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time these photographs were taken ( for you ) another fellow was in charge of capturing her fine ephemerality via expensive camera equipment and artful conceptualizationbut she would later tell me ( once we began to know each other ) that she had " fun " making the pictures . ( She spoke enthusiastically of posing with a " towel " and " phallic-looking bottles " and " fat women " and " dwarves . " ) Heather , as she let me call her ( although a few times I wryly called her " Baby , " as only an older man might when he pretends to be sort of worldly , and , anyway , it seemed to make her laugh ) , is herself nothing if not a shimmering human embodiment of " fun " - which her publicist had assured editors of this magazine during negotiations that led to Heather becoming our cover person ( for you ) . I agree with her publicist on this . She is fun as well as five foot eight , blond , inquisitive , unaffected , sweet , compassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cell phones cause brain cancer , leery of tap water ( more cancer ) , willing to make out with her boyfriend in public places , fond of yoga , and very thin . If certain people think otherwise or do n't care about such qualities , they are probably quite nuts . HERE IN THE NEW WORLD of celebrity appraisal , this is how things have been working : A writer is first permitted to meet a famous subject someplace other than the subject 's home ( intrusive , presumptuous ) , and then they Go Do Things together ( or Create Events ) so that the writer can observe the subject attempt to Approximate Reality , whereupon the writer can then write about these experiences as though they were , in fact , actual unchoreographed happenstance , so that the reader will gain visceral glimpses of revelatory behavioral traits , or candor , thus rich insight . If this sounds like fun , it is . Publicists and editors generally broker the details of such staged assignations between client and writer , so that the initial meeting will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people whose judgment ( both parties pray ) will be trustworthy . If this sounds exciting , it is . ( Unless the circumstance brings together two heterosexual men , in which case it is what it is , nothing more , thank you very much . ) For instance , after much scheduling and many telephone calls , it was decreed that Heather Graham would enter my life-and I hers-one bleak winter afternoon in Venice , California , at a restaurant called Hal 's on Abbot Kinney Boulevard , an odd thoroughfare dotted with eclectic home-furnishing stores , where she reportedly wished to seek out objects for her house , but this turned out not to be true , but she had n't been able to come up with anything else for us To Do . ( Subjects , more often than not , decide on activities . Example : Sharon Stone once decided that she and I would receive massages together , then bake cookies . Another example : Johnny Depp once decided that he and I would climb the ruins of Harry Houdini 's mansion so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See , " Heather confided to me , " I do n't really need to shop for anything . " She is just that honest , by the way . She then asked me if I needed to shop for anything ( " Maybe you need to furnish some place , huh ? " ) , which I did n't , but I was touched that she had asked . ( This , I soon understood , is part of her abundant charm ; she is ever concerned about the needs of others ; unlike many famous celebrities , she is unlike many famous celebrities ; also , she is not too selfabsorbed . ) Anyway , she said : " My publicist was like , " Can you think of a concept of something to do ? ' And I 'm like , " I do n't really do things that are really that fun . ' The ultimate fun is doing nothing . I like doing nothing with people I like-maybe just eating , hanging out and talking . " In no time flat , it seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all whatsoever really . I noticed many men notice her doing this with me . If she noticed any of this noticing , however , I did n't notice it . HERE ARE SOME THINGS you will now learn ( in the text ) about Heather Graham ( partially based on research ) and about the first hour I spent observing her ( for you ) , including various comments she made during that time : At Hat 's restaurant , she offered me a taste of her tuna , which was grilled ( " I wonder if my ordering is too healthy " ) , but kept lustfully eyeing my turkey burger , of which she took several bites ( at my own invitation ) : " Could I cut off a piece ? " she asked , then announced after swallowing , " This is much better than mine . " We agreed that the special mayonnaise was the reason . In fact , I agreed with her on many different matters . " Are n't onions good ? " she cheerfully asked at one point ( re : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Once , before engaging in a love scene with Mike Myers , the comic actor , for the popular 1999 film Austin Powers 2 : The Spy Who Shagged Me , in which she portrayed the sprightly minx Felicity Shagwell , she ate some " really good tuna salad , " made with a lot of onions and garlic that hung thick on her breath during the love scene , despite many spritzes of Binaca , causing Myers to utter amusing remarks to her off camera . ( He apparently compared that kissing experience to " shitting up a pine tree " - which she thought funny at the time , although I can not say that I understand what he might have meant . By the way , in the 1998 film Two Girls and a Guy , she was also seen kissing the actor Robert Downey Jr . for a very long period , during which they both utilized their tongues to prodigious effect before he seemed to burrow his face between her buttocks , whereupon she made loud moaning sounds . She has not seen nor spoken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wondering . ) In case you wonder how she approached the role of pluckish Felicity Shagwell , who wielded guns and did other secret-agenty things , she told me this : " I pretended I was really confident . " And then she laughed , as she will . HERE IS WHERE IT WOULD BE GOOD to ponder the laugh of Heather Graham , and other sounds she makes , in some sentences . The New York Times recently characterized her laugh this way : " She has a laugh that contrasts with her Breyers vanilla ice cream complexion , a flat yet fluttery Phyllis Dillerish ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha . " I do not agree with the Times on this . True , her skin is akin to some sort of dairy product ( a pale kind , pick your brand ) , and , yes , she has a " fluttery " demeanor ( although I would call it hyperblithe or hummingbirdesque or maybe preternaturally caffeinated , but not in a bad way ) , which can produce dizzying loops of rapid-exchange conversation which follow no discernible path ( as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing " flat " about this deservedly flowering film star , including her laugh , which , I will agree , usually begins with an ab , but is then followed by something closer to **44;1005;TOOLONG is to say that the sound is not at all adenoidal but rather guttural , thus more insinuating , conspiratorial , and frankly , quite alluring . ( Further , I can see no reason to bring the great Phyllis Diller into this equation , if you do n't mind . ) What should also be noted ( here ) is that her every utterance and reJ sponse belies a yearning to connect . For instance , whenever someone else ( me ) said things to her , she would concurrently say mm-bm-mm-bm-mm-bm or else **29;1051;TOOLONG . Moreover , her habitual reply to any question will be to ask three or four pointed questions of her own . ( Indeed , so unslakable is her sense of curiosity that she will also frequently add a question mark to any statement of personal fact-such as , " I would n't say that I have a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I very , very rarely do it ? " ) As a result , she tends to elicit more information than she dispenses-which , I am convinced , is not a calculated ploy , as she is the opposite of reticent . What this does mean , however , is that she now possesses a fairly comprehensive knowledge of my life ( how I survived divorce , how I met my girlfriend , how I indulge my daughter , et cetera ) , although I safely believe that she would n't use the information to harm me in any way . Anyway : While most writers cleverly share elements of their own lives in order to prompt the @ame from interview subjects , and while I was flattered by her genuine semi-unwavering interest , it would now seem appropriate to unobtrusively shift focus back to the luster and insouciance that is Heather Graham , who was born in Milwaukee and raised in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills ( since the age of nine , after having spent five years also being raised somewhere in Virginia , following Wisconsin ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized in terrorism ) ( professionally ) ; whose schoolteacher mother has written children 's books ; who no longer speaks to her mother or her father for reasons far too personal ( for you ) ( and probably even for me ) to fathom , although she has obliquely suggested ( to several magazine writers who wo n't leave the topic alone ) that her family 's rigid and unyielding Irish Catholic piousness inflicted indeterminate damage upon her soul and psyche , wherein her pursuit of an acting career ( in which blond girls sometimes have to take off their clothes on-camera and/or pretend to do sexual things to gain attention ) made her constantly feel that her parents constantly felt that she was not theirs-she felt that they felt that she had chosen to go straight to Hell , when all she really did was go to Hollywood , less than an hour from home . ( Here is where the obvious ironic aside-re : Hollywood-would appear , but we will skip that . The larger point , I believe , is that her laugh is not flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : " I 'm sick of hearing myself talk about it . " Also : " I mean , it 's a really hard thing , you know ? " Then we talked for a while about why she should n't have to talk about it anymore ever again ( unless in therapy ) , and we agreed that I agree with her on this matter . 1 CONVENTIONALLY , WHEN A COVER subject has breasts , sly mention of such will be inserted ( in text ) . Any belaboring of this , however , would be considered inelegant . But still . IT IS IT ( AS IN THE PHENOMENON , or moment , of ) that now Photograph Photograph // bears acknowledgment , although this ( It ) has already been made implicit by the fact that Heather Graham is the person wearing nothing more than a pink towel on the cover of this magazine ( for you ) . It is generally subliminally telegraphed in that way . It was in the 1999 Hollywood-satire film Bowfinger , in which she played an opportunistic ingenue who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Steve Martin said this about It ( and , ultimately , about the Heather Graham character ) : " It is a special quality , No matter what 's going on , you can not take your eyes off that person . Every word they say , every gesture-you 're interested in ! " It , many people thought , was meant to commence for her upon the release of the 1989 film Drugstore Cowboy , in which she was , seen dead of a Dilaudid overdose on the floor of a seedy motel room . ( So believable was she in death , perhaps , that we forgot she was still alive ? ) It did not truly begin to take wing for another nine years , however-until she became the peripatetic porn nymphet Rollergirl in the esteemed 1997 film Boogie Nights , in which she was seen naked ( except for roller skates ) while guilelessly posing the question " Are we going to fuck ? " ( As noted above , she excels in the art of inquiry . ) Key roles in films like Lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ( see above ) soon followed , and now one ( you ) can find countless cyberclubs and Web sites that slavishly honor , and point up , her Itness ( among them , Ohh , Heather ; Heather Graham House of Worship ; On the Heather Spot ; Heather Graham Shag Pad ; Abs of Steel : Heather Graham ; and Undeniably Heather Graham ) . If you wonder what she thinks of this sort of online deification , she is conflicted . She told me that she logged on to one such H. G. site " like once , but it just freaked me out . It 's flattering , but then you 're like , Wait till I do something really good and then you can build these pages-you know what I mean ? " ( I believe I did , as the brackets indicate , but by this time I was well into my third hour with her and had grown fairly adept at knowing what she meant . ) ( We had meandered in and out of stores- " Do you want to go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiles and antique mirrors and things . When she walks , I noted , each foot seems uncertain where it will step next . Metaphor looms there , somewhere , probably , but not in a bad way . ) " Usually , " she said , " I hate to watch my work in the movies in which I have appeared . " Certain people disagree with her on this . In something called Stuff magazine ( whatever the hell that is ) , she has been declared the twentysixth Sexiest Woman in the World . That notwithstanding , she said , " It 's still hard to get some jobs , though . " And then , displaying inimitable grace and self-effacement , she laughed . ( Remember-huh-hubs not ba-has , okay ? ) CERTAINLY , UNDENIABLY , the reason for this opportunity to examine the wiles of Heather Graham ( here ) is that she will soon be seen ( starring ) as a willful new wife comically stalking the idiot husband who bolts from their marriage in the very likable forthcoming independent film Committed . ( Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , no sex or even partial nudity in the movie , which seems intentional since no scenes call for such and since Heather Graham , as a diligent actress , is wisely trying to get away from the sex thing , since she has other excellent qualities ( poise , gumption , fragility , interesting teeth , ability to kick-box ) . Inadvertently , I tested her in this regard : On our second afternoon together ( the next day ) , we were driving around Hollywood ( in whose Hills she lives ) in her new Toyota 4Runner , and she asked , as she will , very gamely , " Should we Create another Event ? " So I suggested the colorful notion-because someone had suggested it to meof paying a visit to a rather dilapidated nearby strip club called jumbo 's Clown Room , to which , it turned out , she is no stranger . ( She researched stripping there for some short she once made in which she stripped . ) " My publicist would be so not into it , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She does n't want me to be doing things that are real , like , sexual ? She feels like I already have done a lot of stuff like that ? I think it 'd be kind of fun . But if I told her , she 'd be like makes mortified gasping sound ! " Of course , I could appreciate this point and that sound , as ight her boyfriend of two years , with whom she shares a birthday and her home and his New York apartment-the bright actor-writer-director Edward Burns , whom she calls Eddie and who has said that the only good thing about Los Angeles is Heather Graham and who later told me ( on the phone ) , " I would n't spend one minute here if it was n't for her . " He also said that her performance in the new film " feels , for me , closer to who Heather really is than anything she 's played before . You can tell she 's a sexy woman , but she 's not playing the sexpot . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are frequenty spotted at parties or restaurants obliviously locked in passionte throes . Not long ago , the sister of a friend of mine saw them repair to the first-class lavatory of an American Airlines jet for forty-five minutes . " You got ta live life , right ? " Heather said to me , by way of explanation , and I could only agree . ) While searching for her next role- " You 're like , Where is that script that expresses me , you know ? " - she followed her boyfriend 's lead and began writing a screenplay of her own , which deals with " very serious subject matter " that is " personal but not based on actual reality " and explores the quest of a woman " who 's kind of trying to be happier and kind of achieves it in a way . " Rather than show me pages , she described only one scene : " This actually did happen to me , it was kind of funny , but I do n't know , I think this is funny , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out with this guy and sort of after we had sex he asked me to help him do his taxes . He 's like , " Will you help me organize my receipts ? I need to organize them , and if you want to be my girlfriend , I need help in this . ' And he basically gave me all the tax documents and receipts , but then I sort of realized that I really did n't want to . " I agreed on this being funny but kind of wished that we could have Created an Event at jumbo 's Clown Room , which also would have been funny . Instead , we went to a bookstore near her house , and she made me buy this book called Full-Frontal : Male Nudity Video Guide , which she thought was a funny thing for me To Do-probably not terribly unlike shitting up a pine tree , I suspect . I wonder if anyone will agree with me on this . Her sweater , meanwhile , was snug and pink . I forgot to ask where she bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry . <p>
