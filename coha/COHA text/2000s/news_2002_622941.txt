<p> War looms with Iraq this winter , and experts agree that American forces will unleash a relentless , overwhelming onslaught driven by the latest high-tech weaponry . <p> Planning for such a war in a California-sized nation is at an advanced stage , even as U.N . weapons inspectors continue their work in Iraq , and the United States and United Nations pore over Iraq 's recently released report claiming it no longer has any banned weapons of mass destruction . <p> More than 60,000 American Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine forces already are in the region , and many more are on the way . A major war exercise , " Internal Look , " was held recently in Kuwait and the emirate of Qatar under Gen. Tommy Franks , head of the Army 's Central Command , who would lead the war either from a new headquarters built in Qatar or from MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa , Fla . <p> The U.S. hope for a lightning victory in which casualties on both sides would be limited is spelled out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting techniques over the past decade . In the 1991 Persian Gulf War , about 5 percent of the American bombs dropped were so-called smart weapons  --  computer-steered devices with a lethal accuracy far greater than that of traditional shells . <p> By last winter 's Afghan campaign , about 55 to 60 percent of U.S. munitions were smart weapons . In a new Iraq war , the figure could hit 85 to 90 percent , meaning increased reliance on new weapons such as the JDAM , the Joint Direct Attack Munition that allows precision bombing from B-1 or B-2 Stealth bombers or other planes in any weather , according to the Defense Department . <p> FIRST USED IN AFGHANISTAN <p> Other weapons that debuted in Afghanistan , like the unmanned Predator missile or the Global Hawk eye in the sky , will also play a growing role . <p> " This would be a narrowly focused but extremely intense attack aimed at toppling the regime as quickly as possible , while minimizing the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi population , " said retired Navy Rear Adm . Stephen Baker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Iraq can not hope to win a conventional war in the face of decisive U.S. force , " said Anthony Cordesman , military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . <p> An American-led assault would feature opening strikes designed to destroy Iraq 's air defenses and air forces , which were unable to do much damage to allied forces in 1991 and have failed to shoot down U.S. or British planes over no-fly zones in northern or southern Iraq since then . <p> Iraqi army installations , including those of the elite Republican Guard , would also be targeted . Oil fields would be seized , Iraq 's remaining stocks of Scud missiles and suspected sites where weapons of mass destruction might be kept would be quickly attacked . <p> An important goal of all these quick attacks , which would be followed up by fast-moving land assaults from several directions designed to isolate Baghdad , would be to demoralize Iraqi forces to encourage mass surrender . <p> Baghdad remains the prize , the experts say , if the goal is to overthrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that all its computerized gizmos wo n't do much good in house-to-house fighting . So the result might be a siege of the capital city using psychological warfare designed to produce more capitulations and the possible overthrow of Hussein . <p> Hussein 's military is famous for its incompetence and brutality , having first fought a bloody eight-year border war with Iran , followed by the disastrous 1991 defeat that ousted the Iraqis from Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm . About 400 U.S. military personnel were killed . <p> URBAN WAR <p> But Hussein vows that if the United States tries to oust him , his forces will fight an urban war . <p> Hussein hopes such fighting would test American resolve to accept casualties and could force the United States to kill or wound Iraqi civilians , a development Hussein could use for propaganda purposes . <p> Cordesman and other experts agree the urban-fighting option makes the most sense for Hussein . <p> That strategy " presents the most problems for the U.S. in using air power effectively , and provides the most political advantages in exploiting collateral damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein 's regime will attempt to fight a political battle to the last . " <p> " Although our forces have trained in this environment more so than any other military force , this type of combat is a ' worst-case scenario ' for military planners , " Baker said in his analysis of a possible war . " Expect the full brunt of available airborne firepower , psychological warfare and intelligence assets to be focused in an effort to avoid it . " <p> Hanging over the military planning is the possibility that Hussein might use chemical or biological weapons against his enemies , although his ability to deliver such poisons is a matter of speculation . <p> " The U.S. would have to plan an invasion resembling Operation Desert Storm . While 500,000 troops might not be needed again , half that number could be , " warned a recent analysis by the prestigious Institute for International and Strategic Studies in London . " U.S. casualties might be several times higher than in 1990-91 . " <p> TIMING <p> To avoid the worst of desert heat , a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in 1991 . But as U.N . inspectors proceed with their duties , it 's possible a military effort would be delayed . <p> " It would be harder in March , April or May . It wo n't be as clean or easy , and we might have more casualties , but it 's doable , " said Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings Institution . He served as the Persian Gulf area expert for former President Bill Clinton 's National Security Council . <p> The new analyses take into account the sorely weakened state of Iraq 's military , which has had difficulty acquiring new conventional weapons because of international embargoes after the Gulf War . <p> MILITARY PRESENCE <p> Here are the American military forces near Iraq , as the United States continues preparations for a possible attack .
