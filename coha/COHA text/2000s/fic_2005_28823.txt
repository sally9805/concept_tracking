1 This neighborhood was always middle-class and urban . The advent of the subway at the start of the twentieth century transformed the countryside so rapidly that less than a decade after the stations opened , the fields were gone and the massive , sedate apartment buildings that you see today already lined the streets . They were grand places , designed to persuade prosperous New York families that their bourgeois dignities could be preserved as well in an apartment as in a brownstone row house with a stoop . The building at 635 West 117th Street was similar to scores of others built around the same time , and , like them , it filled with tenants as soon as it was completed , in 1906 . It had twelve stories , with four ample apartments per floor , each divided into a living and dining room , several bedrooms , two bathrooms , all large and airy , plus a small library , and , behind the kitchen , a miniature bedroom and bathroom for the live-in maid . During the Depression , the landlords carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten to twelve on a floor that you find now . The cut-up layouts made no architectural sense , but in those hard times the new tenants could not afford to be choosy . Only a few apartments in the building retain the original floor plan , with the cramped kitchen and tiny sleeping nook where a lonely girl spent her days and nights in service to the family living in comfort in the other rooms . In the waning years of the twentieth century , prosperity returned to the neighborhood , if not to the cash-strapped middle-class and poor people who had lived there for many decades . Lobbies were spiffed up , exteriors scrubbed down . One rental buildingafter another transformed itself into an ownership cooperativewent co-op in New York City parlance ; and rents and prices began climbing out of reach . The elderly residents who had come during the Depression and World War Two barely managed to hang on to the dilapidated studios and one-bedrooms where they had hoped to live out the few years they had left . Except for the lucky ones who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , scrambled to meet the higher monthly payments , and when they failed and were forced to move , their apartments were immediately sold or rented for astonishing profits to high-paid business people and profes-sionals . These mobile newcomers formed a growing group of the well-off : working single renters and couples investing in starter homes they planned to sell for a profit in order to finance bigger and better ones someplace elsemoneyed transients who stayed only two or three years and disappeared , leaving behind not so much as a forwarding address and creating a stock of near-temporary housing that served them much as boardinghouses and residence hotels had served their impoverished counterparts a hundred years earlier . The residential buildings became home to ever more numerous strangers , people who worked long hours , dressed and dined out expensively , and whose names , faces , and circumstances no one knew , except , perhaps , the night doorman . They did nt say good morning or good night or hold the elevator for a straggler . One day in April , apartment 9D came vacant for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of its old-time residents died at the age of 103 . Elizabeth Miller was the daughter of the original tenants , well-to-do people who had moved in when she was a child . Her father had owned a thriving lithography and printing business . Her mother , who had been left comfortable when he died , later received another substantial inheritance from her aunts . There were stories about Miss Miller : that she had run away to be something in show businessan actress or a danceror that her proper parents had thrown her out for leading a scandalous life . It was certain , in any event , that Miss Miller had lived elsewhere for a number of years before returning to care for her elderly widowed mother just after World War II . When her mother died in the late 1950s , Miss Miller inherited enough to support herself , and stayed on in her childhood home , living what seemed , to anyone who bothered to notice , a long , uneventful life in good health . So gentle was her decline that even when she passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent . The only sign of her diminishing vitality in those last years was her difficulty in breathing . There were days when she could say no more than a word or two without pausing to take in air . Then she could do nothing but sit , and her home attendants would take her in a wheelchair down to the lobby or out for a bit of sun , moving her gently , because she might be left gasping by a sudden derangement of her position , or even a high wind . Yet she did not seem to suffer much , from this or anything else . She had a good appetite , smiled graciously at her neighbors , and attempted jokes with the children across the hall . Finally , one of the attendants said , she simply fell asleep at her normal time and never awoke . She had never married , had no children , no surviving relatives or friends , except , perhaps , her trustee , the son of a friend who had died years ago . It was he who paid her bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her day and night on a complicated schedule of shifts . These facts were familiar to many of her neighbors , who for months after her death missed the sight of her tiny figure , crowned with frizzy white curls , wrapped snugly in blankets , on the sidewalk at the front of the building , or being wheeled through the lobby , or riding in the elevator . But none knew her well enough to feel obliged to attend a funeral . The night attendant , who had been on duty when Miss Miller died , and the morning attendant , who had discovered her death , were shaken , however . After the urban death ritual of summoning ambulance and police , they had gone together to see the trustee , for reasons clear neither to them nor to him . He did nt want them in his office and quickly bundled them out with their final pay and their final instructions . The next morning , the two women returned to 9D and began cleaning and closing the apartment as he had directed . They gathered several bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more . Then a truck arrived and carried off silver , china , rugs , paintings , furniture . Finally , they swept and scrubbed , and , before the week was out , they shut the door and left the apartment for good . Anne Braithwaite , Miss Millers longtime neighbor , who knew her well enough to call her Lizzie , observed this rapid disassembling of a century of life with uncomfortably mixed feelings . The Braithwaite family , in 9E , directly across the hall from Miss Miller , had been startled by urgent peals of their doorbell early on the morning that Miss Miller died . Charles was out of town , but Anne was at home with their three children , when Claire , the young morning attendant , came to the door , distraught , to say she couldnt rouse the old woman . Anne went to the bedside and saw for herself that Lizzie was dead . She called an ambulance , and told Claire what to do and say when the police came . For a day or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both believing in Lizzies death and yet looking for her in the elevator or in the lobby . They had not been close , but she had been used to seeing her , with one or another of her attendants , several times a day for more than fifteen years . They had always said a few words , in exchanges that lasted a minute or two , or occasionally as many as five or ten , and Anne had been in Lizzies apartment once or twice . These encounters were in the true New York style , full of goodwill that entailed no intimacy and promised no friendship . Nonetheless , they learned a good deal about one another over the years , as New York neighbors do , despite their standoffishnessenough , in fact , that even in the last couple of years , when Lizzie talked so little , Anne could manage a passable conversation with her , carrying the weight of chatter and filling in the blanks left by her sparse words and gestures . Yet almost before the tiny body had grown cold , Anne also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put up for rent . It was not on her own account that she was interested but for the sake of a friend , who , she had learned only the night before Lizzies death , had arranged to spend two years in New Yorkin fact right in the neighborhood , at Columbia Universityand would need a place to live . Later that week , Anne , returning home from a visit to a doctor with news that had crowded out any thoughts of Lizzie , saw the two attendants handing in their keys to the doorman on their way out of the building . After offering condolences , she got up courage enough to wonder aloud what would happen to the apartment . The trustee will try to sublet , I think , said the older one , Monique , a dignified Jamaican , who had been with Lizzie for many years . Now that her employment had ended , she felt a need to air her grievances . Miss Miller wouldnt buy it when they were pushing her to . So now the building will want to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as he can , to make money charging ten times Miss Millers rent . He s a cheap man . He grudged every mouthful that old lady ate , and she ate like a bird . He says not to burn so many lights , but that old lady she cant see . And he says no money for a new coat . He s so stingy so he can put the money in his own pocket . She was always trying to give us presents , and he kept warning us not to take anything , said Claire , who looked uneasy , but I bet he took plenty . Still shaken by her first encounter with death , Anne thought . She had protective , maternal feelings toward Claire , who had been barely eighteen when the trustee hired her several years agodeceived by her matronly air and figure , no doubt , into thinking her older . Anne knew her real age , just as she knew that money had been tight for Lizzie . These were the sort of domestic details about the household that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The complaints about the trustee were new to her . She did not dismiss them , having confidence in both women after years of watching them care for Lizzie , but their suspicions amplified her queasy guilt about her own motives . Monique and Claire looked pained and troubled after confiding these disturbing thoughts , and lingered aimlessly in the lobby . Anne saw that they disliked their roles as decent bystanders , awkwardly and unfeelingly ministering the intimate after-rites of death for this unmourned soul . Feeling officious yet unable to stop , she found herself offering them the speech proper to the occasion , which no one else seemed to be available to make . They had been good to Lizzie ; Lizzie knew it ; and Lizzie had died happy because , as she had told Anne a couple of years ago , I just want to stay in my own apartment and keep my girls . Thats all I want . They were kind and diligent even though , as Lizzie had declined and grown more and more silent , there was never anyone to thank them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up dishes she liked and taking her to see her favorite flowers on a spring day . But people here knew all this , Anne assured them , while wondering if anyone did but herself . Now , Anne having said what a son or daughter should have said , they could behave the way they felt they should , and they replied with self-respecting modesty . Oh , she was no trouble , such a nice ladyto which Anne countered , graciously , that Lizzies time was up and that we should all hope to be lucky enough to die painlessly in our sleep at 103 . They nodded in vigorous agreement . Yes , yes , she had had a long life , not much trouble , no real want , and no suffering in her death . And after a few more moments of good-hearted banalities , some tears , hands grasped , phone numbers scribbled on paper scraps , the two women went away , with sad but more peaceful faces . The doorman , Willie , who was putting the keys in an envelope and labeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange . They were good to the old lady , he said , suppressed thoughts and emotions erupting in ephemeral twitches around his lips and eyes . Lots of old people in this building have problems . But those ladies made a nice life for Miss Miller . Charles Braithwaite got home from his out-of-town trip soon after this and heard the story of Lizzie , first the childrens excited version and then Annes , in which he quickly detected Annes idea of getting Lizzies apartment for his old friend Morris , a not entirely satisfactory plan from his point of view , although he could not bring himself to oppose it . And just as quickly he scented that Anne had a worrying secret that she could not tell in the presence of the children . As it happened , it was hours later before she found a chance to tell him in a questioning , apologetic voice that she was pregnant . And , as they were neither young nor rich and had three children already , this news was nearly as unwelcome as it was unexpected . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Middle-aged and middle-income , they had rented a portion of one of the original large apartments many years before , bought it when the building went co-op , and lived there for their entire married life . Over the years , as their three children came along , they began to feel squeezed in every way . Space and money got tighter and tighter until , now , they regularly exceeded their income by an alarming amount , falling deeper into debt each year . The children were still young . Besides Stuart , a three-year-old boy , who slept in the living room , there were Jane , almost thirteen , and Ellen , seven , who shared a bedroom . Anne believed that each child needed plenty of time as the youngest before the next one was born , and managed to produce her babies at intervals of at least four years . Charles thought this schedule was the product of sheer strength of will , as neither caution nor the lack of it seemed to affect the timing of her pregnancies . Charles was a singer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted that he would never rise further . Still , he was well respected , with a modest international reputation , known for his versatility and scholarly knowledge and sought out by students as a master teacher ; he had a broad operatic range and was also an accomplished recitalist and singer of art songs . What prevented his greater success was , in part , the lingering consequences of vocal inconsistencies that had plagued him at the start of his career . But friends who knew him well said that Charless character had more to do with it . Unlike most people with courage enough to dare the uncertainties of a career in professional singing , Charles was modest , skilled at advancing his students interests , but incapable of the ordinary tricks of self-promotion . The effects of this were amplified by stubbornness and by his inability to conceal his dislikes . For these reasons , he was incapable of navigating the star system and was fated forever to sing Leporello , never Don Giovanni . He did nt mind terribly , so long as the best students still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of a small circle of admirers whose judgment he respected and so long as somewhere , if not at the Met , he found opportunities to sing what he wanted .
