this is the minnesota state fair i remember most : It was 1960 , a Saturday morning when I was eleven years old , and I was the first one up . I had brought my mayonnaise jar stuffed with dollar bills and coins into the living room , spilled the money out onto the carpet , and then stepped over it to turn the television on to a low volume . I was going to watch The Three Stooges while I sorted my fortune . I had just finished counting when my father came into the room . He was wearing a pair of trousers and a T-shirt and his battered old leather slippers speckled with paint the color of my bedroom walls . His blond crew cut was damp ; you could see the glistening of water in it , making him look anointed , and he smelled of a citrusy aftershave . He was headed for the kitchen , where he would make coffee and bacon . This was his Saturday routine : He 'd take a cup of coffee up to my mother in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eighth of a cup of cream and three level teaspoons of sugar . Then she would come down in one of her silk robes and make pancakes to go with the bacon . I always hoped she would wear her peach-colored robe . It was my favorite , for its generous yardage and elaborate ruffled trim . Seeing what my mother wore was always interesting to me , whether it was the three-quarter-sleeve blouses she wore with the collars up , or the full skirts , tightly belted , or the pastel-colored cashmere sweater sets , or one of her many bathing suits , works of art designed to showcase her spectacular figure . Those suits came complete with cunning little skirts andjackets to wear over them , and broad-brimmed sun hats trimmed with fabric bands in coordinating colors . Before she was married , my mother worked for several years for an upscale department store , parading beautiful clothes before rich men 's wives . She inspired more sales than any other model before or after her ; everyone wanted to look like her , though of course no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green eyes-that was my mother . But it was n't just her model 's training that made it so interesting to see what she wore , it was a quality inside herself . Charisma , my father said , but it seemed to me to be more than that . Other people had charisma . No one had what my mother did . She had a large collection of jewelry , too ; sometimes she allowed me to take one necklace at a time over to her bed , where I would lay it out and turn it this way and that , making it shine hard in the sunlight . " Are these real diamonds ? " I once asked , and she said , " Why have them if they 're not ? " That Saturday morning , my father saw me sitting on the floor and came over to survey my neat stack of dollar bills , my coins piled high . " How much have you got there ? " he asked . " Forty-seven dollars and eighty-three cents . " I kept my smile tight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my toes for the low pull of pleasure . My father whistled between his teeth in a falling-bomb way I greatly admired and could not emulate despite hours of practice . He took his glasses off to polish them on the bottom of his T-shirt , then held them up for inspection : still dirty-he never managed to get them completely clear . " How 'd you get that much ? " He resettled his glasses on his face , pushing them up snug against his nose , a gesture I associated so strongly with him that I reflexively took issue with others doing it . I said I 'd been saving for a long time . I told him about the groceries I 'd carried in for Mrs. Riley , " Mrs. Five Operations , " my mother called her , for her incessant replaying of the laminectomies she 'd endured . I 'd pulled weeds for Muriel and Helen Lockerby , the two wild-haired old-lady sisters who lived around the corner . I 'd babysat for little Rachel Thompson every Thursday after school while her mother went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an arthritic old German shepherd named Heintz , who seemed to me to grimace every time he lifted his leg . I 'd made pot holders and sold them around the neighborhood-once , a man who answered the door in his bathrobe had bought my entire week 's inventory , which made him in my eyes equally wonderful and weird . Also , though I did not tell my father this , I 'd recently found a ten-dollar bill on the street , and I 'd made no effort whatsoever to find the owner . My father told me to wait for just a minute and disappeared . I sat immobile , my high spirits on hold , because I thought he was going to consult with my mother about how much I 'd have to share with my eight-year-old sister , Caroline , who had saved little , and my seven-year-old brother , Steve , who had saved nothing at all . But that 's not what happened . Instead , my father reappeared , holding his wallet . He took out a twenty-dollar bill and handed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my pile , so no one would see . But I found out later that each of us kids had received the same gift . I still remember what I brought home from the fair that day : a lantern that glowed Gatsby green in the dark , which I intended to take under the covers with me to read by ; a bag of Tom Thumb doughnuts so redolent with the scent of cinnamon sugar it nearly levitated me ; a poster of a brown mare and her foal , lying in a field full of daisies . The rest of the money I 'd spent on rides and on chances to win something big on the midway . Over and over I tried , and over and over the carnies at the tacky wooden booths smiled and said , " Sorry . Want to try again ? " They knew what I 'd say . From the time I was quite small , I had about me a certain air of heedless determination . When my funds were gone , I went to the blanket my parents had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our meeting place , our refueling station-our family went to the fair once a year and stayed there all day . We kept a cooler filled with drinks and sandwiches and fruit , deli containers of various salads , Oreos and Chips Ahoy ! - all this though we knew we would be gorging on fair food . There were also pillows and Band-Aids , suntan lotion and insect repellent , aspirin and a couple of Ace bandages . My parents took turns manning the station , sitting in a lawn chair and amusing themselves in their own way-my mother flipping through fashion magazines or crocheting , my father doing crossword puzzles or reading one of the historical tomes he so enjoyed . He tried often to interest us kids in history , saying it was invaluable for putting things into perspective . " You think something 's really great ? " he 'd say . " A long time ago , there was something just as good or better . You think something 's really bad ? Look in the past-you 'll find something worse . Think something can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be sure of . " But we , like most children , did not resonate much to things beyond the day at hand . History had nothing to do with us . My father also liked people-watching-he could sit for hours and stare at all the fairgoers who passed by him and feel perfectly entertained . He just got a charge out of people , their frailties and foolishness as much as their more admirable characteristics . I remember once lying in bed and overhearing an argument between my parents . This was a rare thing ; they almost never crossed each other . But that night my mother was yelling : " Is everything just fine with you , then ? " After a moment , I heard him say simply , Yes , everything was . An accusatory silence followed . I rose up on one arm and leaned toward my parents ' bedroom wall . I heard the ticking of my bedside clock ; the movement of night air in the trees outside my window ; then , finally , the even , comical sounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buttons on my nightgown , and contemplated the disturbing possibility that my parents were not perfect . On that day at the fair when I came back to the blanket , my mother was off with my brother and my sister was with a new neighbor her own age whom we 'd brought along in the desperate hope that Caroline and she would become friends . My father was alone . I sat on the blanket beside his chair , and he gave my shoulder a little squeeze . Then he moved out of the chair to sit beside me . He looked at me for a long moment then asked , " How are you doing , Laura ? " I held my hands out , palms up . " I spent it all . " " Yes , " he said . " But I meant , how are you doing in general ? Is there . . . well , how 's life treating you ? " I smiled . I thought he might be kidding . Sometimes he would ask me about politics in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he would say . And I would shrug and say , " I do n't know . " But his expression now was serious ; he asked me again how I was , so I said , " Good , I guess . " Then , feeling this was not enough , I described my excitement at finding out I 'd be getting the teacher I wanted that year at school : Mrs. Lindemeyer , who was old as the hills , and an easy grader . My father nodded . " So you 're okay , then , are you ? You 're happy ? " The question was odd to me-I did n't ever really think about whether or not I was happy-but I said yes . It seemed he was looking for something he could n't name and I could n't decipher , and the closest I could come to satisfying us both was for me to say I was fine ; I was " happy . " He returned to his chair , and we sat in uneasy silence until the others returned . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple he 'd just eaten , had spent all his money too . My sister had spent none . I remember being astounded at this ; angry , too , that Caroline would be left with so much when I now had nothing . " How can you have fun if you do n't even spend any money ? " I asked her . A pleated caramel-apple wrapper skittered by , and she captured it beneath her shoe . " I had fun . " I snorted . " How ? " She looked up at me , an irritating calmness in her eyes . " I watched . " The new neighbor , Linda Carmichael , confirmed this : While Linda rose high up in the sky on the Ferris wheel , Caroline stood watching and waving from below . " That 's retarded , " I said . I could tell Linda agreed with me , and I remember thinking that she and Caroline would never be friends ; here was yet another opportunity Caroline had lost . " You mind your own business , Laura , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Caroline she was stupid not to eat the treats that were handed out at various classroom celebrations , too . Every time there was a party at school , Caroline ate nothing . No candy corn at Halloween , no message hearts on Valentine 's Day , no red- and green-sprinkled spritz cookies at Christmas , no garishly decorated cupcakes brought in because someone in class was having a birthday . Instead , anything she ever got she tented with paper towels and then carefully carried home on the school bus . As soon as she walked in the door , she presented it to my mother and my mother ate it . I never understood this about Caroline . Now I do . It 's all clear now : the times Caroline , as a small child , lay in the hall outside the bathroom door while my mother bathed . The presents she later bought for her with babysitting money : barrettes , scarves , lipsticks . Paperback books and velvet roses . " Brownnoser ! " I once whispered after she 'd given my mother a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the kitchen table where I was doing homework and began pulling books and papers out of her schoolbag . She was in sixth grade then , and I in eighth . " Brownnoser ! " I said again , out loud . " Laura , " my mother said , and I returned to my homework . There was a tiny smile on Caroline 's face , and I kicked her under the table . She did not kick me back ; rather , she moved away to another chair and straightened with pinched-nose efficiency a stack of notebook paper that did not need straightening . She cocked her head slightly to the left and the right as she did it . I hated it . I glared at her between narrowed lids ; I believed I could feel heat coming from my eyeballs . All this was to no avail ; Caroline looked at her schoolwork only . Then came a gift I remember particularly well , something given to my mother by Caroline the Christmas she was sixteen . It was the last gift opened that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother stared at it briefly , murmured a low thanks , and started to put the picture back in the box . " What is it ? " I said . " Let me see ! " I snatched it away . The picture was of Caroline wearing one of my mother 's slinky evening gowns , her hand on her hip . Caroline 's auburn hair , the same color as my mother 's , was styled in a twist like the one my mother always wore . Her makeup was heavily applied in a style exactly my mother 's own , and she stared unsmilingly into the camera . It was chilling , the look on Caroline 's face : the flat eyes , the hard line of mouth , the remove . I had never seen such a look . " What is this supposed to be ? " I asked . My brother took the photo from me and looked at it . He burst into laughter , the goofy adolescent-boy kind , and Caroline grabbed the picture from him and threw it onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She turned to stare at my mother , who did not look back at her , and then left the room . " Caroline ! " my father called after her . " Come back here ! " But she did not return . My father rose , as though to go after her . Then he saw the picture , and he sat back down . This I understand now , too-as well as what my father meant that long-ago day at the fair , when what he was really asking was if I knew .
