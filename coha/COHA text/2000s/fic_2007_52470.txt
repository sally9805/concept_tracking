THOUGH ONLY A LITTLE AFTER DARK , the neighborhood was already deserted No light spilled from the stone houses lining the street ; with iron shutters bolted shut from the inside and doors locked , the buildings offered no hope of help . " So what are you ? " I could n't tell from their accents or their clothes which side they were on , the small gang cornering me . Down the narrow street that followed the steep decline of the hill into which our town had been incised by sailors nine or ten centuries ago , a dog wandered from one pile of trash to the next . At dawn , garbage collectors would haul away the refuse set before each house . Were they neighborhood vigilantes , protecting their homes from invading toughs ? Or were they from the other side of the hill , here to terrorize the locals ? I could n't tell . " What do you mean ? " I asked , forcing a smile as I turned from one face to another . But they were hard men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably from a rooftop terrace . Women 's voices , I thought , or maybe a mother singing with her child . I could n't be sure . " You know what we mean . " He seemed to be the leader , the one who answered my question . A hat , tugged low over his forehead , and the upturned collar of his jacket concealed most of his face . But the thick nose above his mustache told me he hailed from the region ; the fellow was not some outsider from the capital or farther inland . Just like all the rest of us around here , he had a nose too big for its face . That 's why they despise us , I guess , our countrymen-we 're so damned ugly . Maybe that 's why we hate each other so much , too . I figured he must be the most intelligent ; I tried to make conversation with him . " Let me buy you a drink , " I offered , but not in the language the government has forced on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the hill . " And for your friends . Drinks all around . " He declined , adding the polite phrases you ca n't avoid in our tongue when you say no . That made it more intimate between us , me and the man in the hat , pronouncing the whispery words we 'd grown up with . It was like sitting down with a fellow traveler you 've just met to a meal they usually serve only back home where you both come from . " Look , " I appealed with a shrug and the kind of open-handed gesture you use to plead ignorance , " I do n't follow politics . I 'm too busy trying to make a living . Yellow Party ? Brown Party ? I do n't know what I am . " He cursed me , but in our dialect it 's not so harsh , that sort of expression . The voice trails off at the end of a sentence addressed to a particular person , making it almost a question , as if you 're not sure you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier for him to threaten me the other way ; but whatever your party , if you 're from around here , you resent it , having to express yourself in the language they speak in the rest of the country . " No , it 's true , " I insisted . " My wife 's mother lives with us , and her miserable brother , too , the drunk . I have to feed them all . Why do you think I 'm on my way home so late ? Dawn to dark , every day . " I thought I caught the fat one with the beard sigh in sympathy , so I laid it on even thicker . " And still she complains , my wife . 1We do n't have enough , " she says . Of course we do n't have enough , not with her relatives costing us everything I earn . So how 's somebody like me going to keep up with things when I ca n't even afford a newspaper in the evening ? " The part about being a poor working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made it up . No wife , not me . Almost once , yes , but she ran off with somebody else , the bitch . And I 'm not going through that again . So a lie not too hard to believe , that 's what I offered them . I thought maybe they had in-laws waiting for them at home . Maybe that 's why they were out at night , wandering the streets , looking for somebody to kill . To keep from having to go home . But the leader , the guy with the hat , he 'd apparently heard it all before . " What are you ? " he calmly demanded again . I counted four of them , but then I felt a heavy hand on my back giving me a little shove . " Answer the question , " the gruff voice behind me insisted . Five , I realized . The dog approached on unsteady legs . Probably sick , it occurred to me , from eating garbage . Then I remembered it takes longer than that , food poisoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously toward the mutt . I could tell he was afraid of dogs . " I wish I knew what to say . I get confused when it comes to politics . It 's beyond me , all that " The young one slipped around to the other side of the group , away from the dog . " So what are we going to do with you ? " the leader asked me , employing the form of " you " we reserve for children . It sounded tender , almost amused , put that way , his question . " Well , uncle , I do n't know . " It 's old-fashioned , addressing an older man like that , but still proper . It shows respect . And sort of funny , I thought , after what he had just said . He got the joke . Nodding with admiration , he decided , " You must have some pair of eggs . " " Let 's go ask his wife , " the one behind me snarled , guffawing like a moron . I was offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , you can even ask her what my eggs taste like . At least , that 's what I almost told him until I remembered : Wait a minute , I do n't have a wife . I was n't going to get myself killed over an insult to a woman who does n't exist . The hat was losing patience . One last time . What are you ? " Over his shoulder , I noticed the mutt sniffing at a bucket of reeking slop covered haphazardly with a plank of wood weighted down by a stone the size of a baby 's head . " The thing is , " I began , trying to buy another minute or two , " I do n't really get the difference . I mean , which is which , the two parties . Their beliefs , that 's where I get confused . " The curl of the street blocked our view of the harbor , but suddenly the clatter of halyards lashing masts crackled through the darkness . That time of year , squalls blow in without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep talking . " I know around here most of these people , they call themselves Browns . I get that . But what exactly that means-well , I have a hard time keeping it straight . " " If you 're not with us , you 're against us . " The hat was about to make up his mind . I 'd run out of time . " Then I guess I 'm with you . " Now the dog was skulking among our feet . None of the men paid any attention to the animal , except the young one , who edged farther away from his friends . " So you 're a Brown , too ? " the leader asked , but slipping back into the child 's you he had used before . If the moron behind me had been asking the questions , I would n't have stood a chance . But guys like the hat , the clever ones , they ca n't help it . Sooner or later , they always give themselves away . " Brown ? " I repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you take me for ? I 'm a Yellow , just like you . " The heavy hand clapped me on the back of my shoulder . " Well , why did n't you say so from the beginning ? We thought you were one of these shits from around here . " I turned and faced him . " Why do you think ? How could I be sure you were n't one of these shits from around here ? " It took him a moment to figure out he had n't been insulted . Then he burst with thick laughter . Startled , the dog barked . " Come on , let 's get going , " the young one shouted , already halfway up the street . As the others followed the boy , the hat paused in front of me . " Some eggs . " I shrugged . " What do I know about politics ? " That 's how we left it .
