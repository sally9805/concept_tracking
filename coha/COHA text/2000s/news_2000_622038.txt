<p> Social Security is the biggest investment most Americans make in their lives . <p> It takes 12.4 percent of their paychecks every week of every year from their first day of work to their last . And when they quit working , many Americans will live on Social Security 's benefits . <p> The program 's finances will begin to deteriorate in about 15 years , with vast consequences for millions of working and retired Americans . Few national problems pose more vexing or far-reaching choices . And none more starkly dramatizes the fundamental policy differences between Texas Governor and Republican nominee George W. Bush and his Democratic opponent , Vice President Al Gore . <p> Bush 's plan to introduce personal retirement accounts into Social Security , announced Monday , would mark the biggest change to the program since its creation in 1935 . <p> Although critical details are scarce , Bush proposes allowing individuals to take some portion of their Social Security payroll tax and invest that money for themselves . <p> Gore 's plan would likewise bring a fundamental change to the program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift billions of dollars in future government revenue  --  generated by interest savings on paying down the national debt  --  to Social Security . Such a move would break the historic link between Social Security and payroll taxes , shifting the cost of the program to the general federal budget and future taxpayers . <p> Both plans entail enormous risks and opportunities . <p> In essence , Gore is banking on economic growth and continued budget surpluses to rescue Social Security , following the model President Clinton proposed a year ago . By paying down the national debt , he argues , the nation can free up resources to continue paying Social Security benefits without cutting benefits or increasing taxes . <p> Bush is betting that personal accounts will give people more control over their retirement and an opportunity to get more back from their payroll taxes . He also hopes that higher stock market returns on those investments will help rescue Social Security from insolvency . <p> Social Security 's problems have been long evident . The program operates pay-as-you-go , with taxes on current workers financing benefits for current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge Baby Boom generation retires , there will be increasingly fewer workers to pay taxes into the system , and increasingly more retirees collecting benefits . <p> By 2015 , payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits . The government will have to borrow money , raise taxes or cut benefits to make up the shortfall . While the Social Security trust fund will remain in surplus until 2037 , the trust fund consists of bonds , or IOU promises to pay future benefits . The government must still raise money to make good on the bonds . <p> By 2037 , even the bonds will run out . At that point , payroll taxes will cover an estimated 75 percent or less of benefits . <p> Bush contends that if workers could invest a portion of their payroll taxes  --  probably around two percentage points  --  they could more than triple the 1.88 percent return they can now expect from Social Security . The stock market historically has generated an average 7 percent return . <p> " A worker who invests even a limited portion of his or her paycheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of dollars at retirement , " Bush said . The private accounts would be voluntary , and would have to be invested in conservative investment funds . <p> The Bush campaign argues that private accounts would allow poorer workers and younger workers especially to build wealth , and pass that wealth on to their heirs . <p> Critics charge that Bush ignores the risk of stock market investing , especially if workers build their accounts during a long bear market , when returns could be negative . " Unless you 're willing to say the government will come in and make that up , in fact benefits are in jeopardy , " said former Clinton economic advisor Laura Tyson , now dean of U.C. Berkeley 's business school . <p> Tyson , answering questions for the Gore campaign , said it is " certainly true " that stocks outperform other investments , but that 's because stocks are riskier . " You can win big and you can lose big , " she said , but private accounts introduce " unnecessary risk and undermine the social insurance aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bush omitted a host of critical details  --  many of them politically explosive  --  that would determine just how well workers might do , or what added risks they might face , or whether indeed private accounts would do anything to ease Social Security 's insolvency . <p> If workers ' future Social Security benefits are reduced by the amount that is diverted to their personal accounts , the Bush plan could begin to shore up the current system by replacing the system 's IOUs with real money , transitioning Social Security from a pay-as-you-go transfer to a pension program at least partially funded with real assets . <p> But Bush did not say whether his plan would do that . <p> " That 's a big , important gap , " said Rudolph Penner , a budget expert at the Urban Institute . " We do n't know how he 's going to finance that extra 2 percentage points , but most people finance a large part of it by reducing the growth in benefits . " <p> Michael Tanner , who oversees the Cato Institute 's Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits slightly more than the proportion you reduce revenues , " Tanner said . Otherwise , private accounts do nothing to fix Social Security 's solvency . Tanner argued that even if benefits are reduced , the higher returns on personal accounts will still leave workers much better off . <p> Moreover , Bush promised not to cut benefits for current or near retirees , not to raise payroll taxes and not to reduce benefits for the disabled or widowed . <p> And Bush wants a $1.3 trillion tax cut over the next ten years . That would drain away money that privatization advocates say would be needed to shore up the old system as payroll taxes are diverted to personal accounts . <p> A Bush economic advisor said Bush omitted details because , " he wants the American public to focus on the threshold question , " of whether Social Security should include personal accounts . <p> Gore argued that personal accounts may sound good , but would " weaken our economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum basic retirement . " <p> Instead , Gore contends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security payroll taxes should be used to pay down the debt . The resulting interest savings could then be shifted to the Social Security trust fund . <p> " Times have changed , " Gore said . " The economy is strong today , and if we keep making responsible choices , we can reform Social Security the right way . " <p> The projected interest savings are huge , eventually reaching over $200 billion a year . Gore contends the money would postpone Social Security 's insolvency to 2050 , which is far enough in the future to allow taking less radical measures now . <p> Gore said Bush 's private accounts would " turn Social Security into a system of winners and losers " that would " jeapardize the security of millions of Americans . " <p> But critics say Gore 's plan entails big risks too . <p> By shifting Social Security 's vast liabilities onto the general budget  --  where somehow the money would also have to materialize  --  Gore 's plan simply exchanges one IOU for another , while leaving the program 's underlying problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest a portion of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds . <p>  --  The present system for current and near-retirees would be maintained ; the plan does n't specify what would happen to younger workers . <p>  --  No increases in payroll taxes . <p>  --  Surplus Social Security revenues would be used only for the retirement program . <p> . <p> GORE <p>  --  The current system would be maintained . <p>  --  The program would rely on future government surpluses and economic growth to maintain benefits . <p>  --  Interest savings from paying down the debt would be diverted to the Social Security trust fund . <p>  --  No increases in payroll taxes .
