A traditionalist looking back at the 1950s sees a golden age of American Catholicism  --  fish on Friday , confession on Saturday , seminaries full and John Kennedy on the road toward the White House . The liberal ( or lapsed ) Roman Catholic may have a different take : sexual repression , nuns and priests perched like crows above the cowering innocent , Sister Nutcase brandishing a ruler . Now , in the waning days of the papacy of John Paul II , and particularly after the 2002 priest scandals , the contradictions have , if anything , hardened . Conservatives work to institutionalize their resistance , and liberals wait wistfully , hoping that they have time on their side . <P> Who 'll win ? Two first-rate new studies line up more or less on the side of time and the liberals . Peter Steinfels ' A People Adrift ( Simon &; Schuster ; 392 pages , ) and David Gibson 's The Coming Catholic Church ( HarperSanFrancisco ; 350 pages ) are both thoughtful , moderate in their judgments and worried . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism will hardly disappear . But it will face the sadder fate of a slow-motion enervation . " <P> At this point , necessity seems to make better arguments for change than ideology can . In the 1950s there was one priest for every 650 American Catholics . By 2005 , according to one survey , there could be one priest for every 2,200 . Many American priests are overworked , demoralized by loneliness and scandal , underrespected . According to Gibson 's statistics , more than 3,000 ( out of 19,000 ) U.S. parishes are without a resident pastor , and about 2,400 are forced to share a pastor . In the meantime , the exodus from nunneries has been spectacular . <P> In response , lay Catholics today participate in parish life in numbers  --  and exert an influence  --  unimaginable a few generations ago . For the church , that is good news and bad  --  the bad news being that the muscle tone of the institution suffers when numbers of American individualists feel free to do it themselves , as they have long since done in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shinto Catholicism  --  a mild form of Sunday theater . <P> Facts on the ground seem to argue for the ordination of women and for allowing priests to marry . But beyond such sexy controversies , the deeper question is how the inherently authoritarian leadership of the Catholic Church  --  in many ways sclerotic , brittle , self-defensive in the manner of all aging bureaucracies  --  can preserve what is best and permanent , what is sacred , while letting in fresh air and new life . Can what is changeless be preserved only by the intelligent application of change ?  --  By Lance Morrow
