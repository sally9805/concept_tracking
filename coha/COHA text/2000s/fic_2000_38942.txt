Rand Lee 's last appearance here was - The Green Man " back in August of 1997 . He has been at work on several projects in the meantime , including a fantasy for young readers entitled The Moming Knight and a murder mystery set in the same universe as the following science fiction story . Rand lives in New Mexico and finishes stories much too infrequently .

He has the sort of door that needs to be knocked , which shows you what an odd old man he is , and suggests his rural habitation . No shineystone walls , here : just four hundred winters ' worth of sagging farmhouse , built of oak ( remember oak ? ) and roofed with shingles , not solar filament . Hearing the knock , wondering who it can be , the old man sighs , as his house does some stormy nights , and some still nights , too , when there are no visitors but crickets ( remember crickets ? ) . <p> He swings his good leg out of bed first . No semisentient bodyconforming matrices ; just a bed : vegetable-fiber mattress , metal boxsprings , cherrywood frame like old blood under the moon ( remember cherrywood ? ) . The bed creaks with Ziomek 's shifting weight . The other leg , the bad , dead leg , the one that ends in a stump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection of limb regeneration was possible and biomechanics popular ) , only comes out of the bed when the old man has gotten some crutches ( look it up ) under his armpits . The old man swings himself upright on the crutches and heads across the room in the dark . The knock sounds again , and with it a voice : " Dad ? " <p> Old Man Ziomek stiffens and stops where he is . He does not know what to do . He has not cleaned the house ; he has not cooked anything , he has forgotten completely that today was the day his son was supposed to arrive for his last visit home before the unimaginable . He stumps to the bedroom door and opens it . In the hall , the palings <p> of the banister gleam bonelike in the nightshine from an open window . He stumps around to the staircase , then down , one step at a time , treacherous steps for a man on crutches , steps built for young unfettered feet to dart up and down . " Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you awake ? 11 It is taking longer than the old man has expected to negotiate the stairwell . His leg and crutches do not seem to want to descend any farther . So he stops to rest , calling out in his strongest tone , " I 'm coming ! " His voice splinters in the stairway 's dark air , and the shadows suck it up . <p> Memory : five-year-old Nandi standing before him in the Immigration Reception terminal , fresh from early childhood in some Godforsaken British hellhole , thin arms and legs and grave ancient eyes , hands at the sides : " Hello , Father . - It takes Ziomek two years to teach the boy to call him - Daddy . " And when the child says it for the first time , it is as though the word were a dead fish he was holding gingerly between thumb and forefinger . <p> " I 'm coming ! " cries the old man . " Just wait ! " He wishes now he had allowed the Net people to install an interface in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to get up , but he hates the Net ; it reminds him how old he is . He attains the second floor landing , rounds the banister . Another series of knocks : " Dad ? Are you awake ? " His son 's voice reverberates through the house . It occurs to the old man that there is a nervous note in it . <p> By the time Ziomek reaches the ground floor living room , the knocking has ceased and he is out of breath . Paintings , pictures , bric-abrac , and stacked books crowd around him in the blackness , watching his laboring chest with the respectful silence of the similarly aged . He thinks , Perhaps Nandi has gone away and will not come back . " I 'm almost there ! " he cries , and pushes himself to the door . <p> " All right , Dad , " comes the reply , and he nearly sags with relief . He puts his hand to the door-locks . He thumbs the first plate ; the second ; the third . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes several steps backward and braces himself on the padded back of the antique couch . He bawls with all his strength : " Come in ! Come in ! " He holds his breath . The door swings inward . Nandi fills the frame , Nandi his son , seven feet tall and absolutely blue-black-skinned , blacker than the tree-scented summer night . Ziomek 's heart jumps , swells , spills over . Nandi 's face is furrowed with concern . He sets down a piece of luggage on the floor . " I knocked forever . Why are the lights off ? Are you all right ? " <p> Ziomek laughs in terror . " It 's the middle of the night . The light hurts my eyes . I was asleep . " <p> Nandi throws back his head and laughs in basso . " Of course you were asleep . I keep forgetting the time differences . Oh , Dad , it 's good to see you . " He enfolds his father in big dark arms . <p> Memories : Nandi 's first cautious steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of Particle Accelerator , the nanny-goat , giving birth , Nan diplanting beans by hand in a summer field ; sixteen-year-old Nandi drunk on red pepper wine , shouting one moment and sullen the next ; Nandi standing on the steps of the tube station , luggage at his feet , turning to wave at his father before he ascends to the platform and the great wide world beyond . <p> Then , the beginning of sorrows : Nandi at university graduate school receiving the Arturo E. Gonzales Award In Linguistic Excellence for his paper , " Anomalous Damanakippith/fy Pseudoverb Stringing ; " Nandi 's excited Net call upon his appointment to the Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission , and their argument ; Nandi 's dogged lasezfaxes from the Interspecies Contact Station out near Titan ; Nandi 's news that the Damanakippith/fy had chosen him as one of a hundred Companions who would return to their vast skipper-ship to live with them as part of their Family . " For how long ? - Ziomek asked . " Maybe a long time , - Nandi replied . Meaning forever . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and turning , drags after him toward the kitchen , talking all the while . " You seem taller , " he says over his shoulder . " What do they feed you on that base ? Come in and sit down . Are you hungry ? I 've got some hoop cheese with spring onions from PartAcc III ; I wrapped some in the cooler just for you . Come and sit down . What 's the matter ? " he adds , for Nandi has stopped moving after only a few steps . <p> " Dad , " Nandi says , " I brought a friend . " <p> Ziomek blinks . And then he sees what has been standing in the shadows of the foyer , what must have been standing there all the while , watching them paw one another . The Creature is taller than Nandi . It is furred , shaped like a Human with overtones of horse , or rather centaur : two wiry arms , elbowed in the Human way ; a muscular , nippleless barrel chest narrower than its waist ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wide-pelvised , almost haunchlike , with big muscular legs oddly kneed . Its fur is dark gray , but even in the shadows it is full of halfhidden silver . There are great sweeping curves of it , gleaming and sliding over slabs of muscle , some of it long and silky , some of it dense and short , like velvet pile . Whatever might show between its legs is hidden by what looks like a finely tooled leather equipment belt , complete with apron front and back . Its big splaying nailless feet are sandaled in the same tooled leather , " Oh , " says the old man . Its skull is more rounded than that of a Human and framed in a cloud of the finest imaginable silver hair , the famous Damanakippith/fy " halo . " Silver velvet furs the face , with darker gray on the cheeks and forehead ( A cosmetic ? wonders the old man ) . Its eyes are mild , moist , warm , and alert , bigger than Human-normal , with a horse 's long elegant eyelashes , silvery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its nose is flat gray-fleshed , slit-nostriled , mashed-looking . Its mouth is small , gray , and thin-lipped , almost prim but for the fact that it turns up at the comers , which gives it an appealing quality , a relief to the eye after the near-menacing power of the Creature 's musculature . It has no visible ears . Its big hands end in five very long very beautiful nailless fingers . <p> Of course , he has seen pictures of the Damanakippith/fy , but they have not even remotely prepared him for this . <p> " Daddy , sorry , " murmurs Nandi . His son steps back and reaches up ( up ! ) to place a great black hand in the Creature 's silvery shoulder fur . " Dad , I would like you to meet my best friend . His name is Bormw6thu/ 6nene. 11 At the glottal stop halfway through the name , Nandi 's right hand flutters near his throat . " In Primary Persona Manafut , it means Bringer of the Correct Equation . " <p> Oh , yes . Bor-MWAY-thoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . Now that his initial shock is past , he remembers his plan , hatched in the small hours of the night since the arrival of Nandi 's latest news . Imust behaveperfectly , he thinks . Everything depends upon it . He clears his throat and faces the Creature , forcing himself to meet the Creature 's calm eyes . " Greetings , friend of my son , " he says formally in English , and then , translating slowly , hands moving laboriously , " P'lp ' /tyensti-mlelet Nem/ene , " the D ' /fy equivalent . <p> Nandi 's jaw drops . The D ' /fy does not move or reply at first . It stands quiet , huge in the hallway , as though paused to consider a course of action . Heart racing , the old man thinks , Oh , God , I got it wrong , I got it wrong , oh , God . Then it opens its mouth and , eyes glowing with warmth , says in English , " Greetings , father of my friend . " Its voice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenor , like the old man 's voice , with muscle underneath it like the son 's . Its " F 's sound a bit like " V " s in Ziomek 's ears . Now the old man can detect a fragrance from the Creature 's skin , very faint and elusive , like rain . He waits fearfully for it to say something else , something in Manafut , which he will not understand , but it does not , as though it knows and does not wish to embarrass him . <p> Nandi says , " Dad , that was beautiful ! Where did you learn " Your farm is an exquisite being , " says the Creature . It speaks as though tasting the words as they come out of its mouth , and its eyes are full of wonder . " It sleeps with great courage , here in the night . " It looks to Nandi and breaks into a glittering phrase in Manafut . Nandi replies . It regards the old man again . " Not courage . Encouragement . Enthusiasm . Your farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams in exuberant layers . There are so many dreams here ! In Sidney , there are as many , but they are not as layered . On our ship , there were few dreams of any kind ; we had grown too much awake . " A whisker of sadness . " But since your people have permitted us to approach to you , to walk with you , there are very many dreams again . We are grateful to the twelfth power . We are grateful forever . " <p> Silence falls . The old man realizes he has been holding his breath against the Creature 's charm . Not charm , thinks the old man . Glamour . The Creature has glamour in the old sense of the word , " enchantment . " But he must answer ; politeness demands it . With an effort he says , " Stim#lele , " crossing his hands above his genitals halfway through the word . Nandi is smiling broadly . The Creature 's expression does not change ; it continues to observe him with its huge eyes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trying to be casual , he smiles and says to the alien , " It 's good to have you here . I know you folks like to sleep outside when you 're on Earth , so feel free to bunk down wherever you feel comfortable . " To his son he says , " Your room has n't moved and neither has that big bed of yours . Linen 's where it always is . " To them both he says , " And now if you young people will forgive me , I 'd better head off to bed before I drop where I stand . " <p> Nandi murmurs endearments and apologies ; the alien lowers its eyes , bows slightly , and takes three steps backward . And the old man turns and wades through the night-stuffed sitting room toward the foot of the empty stair . ABLUTIONS When he awakens , from a peculiar , distasteful dream about hunting a worm which has gotten into the cowbarn , the strength of the sunlight pushing through his bedroom window alerts him to the lateness of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can view from his window , no sound from the animals , no movement in the house . His heart flares in fear that his son has left already . As quickly as his crutches will allow , he hurries through his ablutions and down the stairs . <p> He finds them in the heirloom vegetable garden , standing in the waist-high corn side by side with their arms entwined , like lovers . His son has shed his shirt and gleams ebony in the Pennsylvania forenoon ; the Creature , by contrast , is an almost blinding silver . They are silent , black and silver , looking north across the Hopi Blue corn and the Montezuma Red beans and the Costata Romana zucchini and the Old German tomatoes toward the industriously turning windmill . <p> The moment he lays eyes on them , Old Man Ziomek knows that no matter what he does , no matter what he says , he will never again hold the place in his son 's heart that he once held . Lines from William Blake tease Ziomek 's memory , flitting away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the garden , but stands on the grassy verge , waiting for them to notice him , his stomach doing flip-flops , his throat opening and closing like the fist of a reluctant murderer . <p> It is Bringer of the Correct Equation who stirs first , turning its head almost 180 degrees to face behind it , as owls do . It utters a few notes in its language . Nandi disengages arms and turns full-body . " Dad , " he says , gladly . " It 's so beautiful here . I 'd forgotten . " <p> The DI/fy says , " Everything is in balance . The soil organisms are fat and lazy . There is an abundance of fatness here . " <p> " Fatness and fatness , " agrees the old man grimly . " Not many spreads like this left . No subsoil biomechanics , no genegineered crops . Never have been . Sort of a historical curiosity , I guess . " <p> Nandi looks back at the distant windmill . " When I came here from London when I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I did . I was n't used to bare earth , or open sky , or animals , except cats and dogs and rats and roaches . " He looks pointedly at his father . " And I was n't used to adults who neither struck me nor tried to bugger me . " <p> " I know , " says Ziomek . Did you imagine I had forgotten the locks we had Shel put on your door so you could feel safe enough to fall asleep ? Nandi spreads long-fingered hands to the field . " This place taught me <p> different , Daddy . You taught me different . You taught me a place could have green in it and not devour me . " <p> " Then why did you leave ? " blurts Ziomek . Instantly he blushes a deep red and holds up his hands . " Forgive me , son . Stupid ; I 've been missing you . Of course I know . It was n't about me ; forgive me . " He glances nervously at the Damanakippith/fy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice sounds loud in his own ears . The Creature shimmers without moving . <p> Nandi takes a deep breath , expels it . " Do n't apologize . I had to make my own world , Daddy . I never had a world of my own . just as the D ' /fy have never had a world of their own . Their Ship wandered for generations , looking for a place to come to rest . They know what homelessness feels like . So do L " <p> " Yes , " says the old man . He looks tenderly at his son . " I never fooled myself about that . I knew I could n't wipe out your past for you . " <p> He becomes suddenly , keenly aware of the D ' /fy , as though the Creature were behind his eyes with him , not as an intruder , but as a friend , an old friend , perhaps the oldest of all friends ; an ally , somehow , on his side in the most profound sense . And riding this sensation come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poetical Sketches : - How sweet I roamed from field to field , And tasted all the summer 's pride , <p> Till I the prince of love beheld , <p> Who in the sunny beams did glide ! , ' No , thinks the old man , appalled . He rips his eyelids open , outraged to feel something he has not felt in a long time : the stirrings of an erection . Trembling with panic , he turns from them and stumbles toward the fence , barely hearing Nandi 's " Daddy , what 's wrong ? " fleeing in jerks on his goddam fucking crutches why the hell did n't I get the leg machine ? into the farmhouse , where he sits down in the big stuffed chair and weeps . <p> A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY Sitting in his chair in his parlor , listening to the ticking of the clock ( remember clocks ? ) , Old Man Ziomek gives in to despair . Now and then he catches a silver note of Bormwdthu/dncne , fluting , or his son 's dark rumble . But once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in his head , that he has not succeeded in ejecting it , that it rests a private silver unobtrusive merciful presence within him , like a statue of Kwan Yin in a temple nook close . He does not have the will to say " No ! " to it again . <p> He remembers the day the farm was acquired . They had met in this very house : Shel , Blue , Ricardo , Mackley , Arden , Thomas , Dolbeare , Ziomek . They were young , but not too young to understand what " home " meant , and their need for it ; tired of the world 's relentless pace , but not too tired to tackle the task of building their Eden . He alone had experience of agrarian living , coming as he did from a family of farmers , though Mackley was a laboratory plant-breeder and Blue , the Oil Wars veteran , an antique technology specialist . <p> Shel , the grant writer , outlined the steps they would need to secure longterm funding . Ricardo , the religious historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cults in North America , and presented his first draft of the Rules &; Regs . Ziomek presented his working model of the Farm and Mackley explained what antique vegetable varieties were and the commercial viability of growing out existing seed-bank stocks to replace them with fresh material for hybridization and selection . Arden , the psychologist , explained current extended-family-model theory . Thomas , the social services specialist , offered a range of community involvement ideas , chief among them a revival of the ancient tradition of Summer Camp for urban children . Dolbeare talked art and design . They argued and laughed and drank and , in the fuzzy moist dim hours of the deepest night , became one . <p> The community had sprouted from the fertile compost of their group passion ; flowered into a rollicking noisy happy stand of small research fields and play spaces ; rung with the voices of children , most of them temporary visitors but some of them long-term residents , like Nandi . Now the children have grown up and gone and the seed-stocks so carefully nurtured have gone forth into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we have begun to die , thinks the old man . Thomas gone of recombinant cancer , Arden off to lusher academic pastures and a young lover ; Dolbeare the darling of the Net , too grand for us ; Mackley witless under chemo at County General . Only the four of us left , now : Shel , Blue , Ricardo , and me . And Ricardo barely knows his own name these days . <p> It is time , he realizes , to face facts : Nandi will soon be gone forever and he will be alone with his fading cronies and a farm too labor-intensive for them to run themselves , even with the apprentices ' help . His great plan , hatched in the secret hours , is laughably impossible . He will simply have to make the best of a bad situation . <p> Sun and shadow shift . The front door opens , and a tall broad form moves into the living room , blocking out the summer light . Ziomek begins , " Son , " then stops . <p> It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and observes him . It says , " The child is young . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " says Old Man Ziomek . His mouth is dry . " The child is young , " the Creature says again . Something in the way it looks at him stirs the old man 's memory . Oh , God , he thinks . He 's starting one of those damn ritual chain-meditations . It is , he knows , a Damanakippith/fy healing technique , a kind of counseling ; the D ' /fy , it seems , are not immune to depression . We had grown too much awake , it has said . <p> According to the rules he studied by complight , he can refuse to engage , but something makes him plunge ahead anyway . " The child is young , " he repeats , nodding , pretending ease , though pretense of ease during ritual chain-meditation is a Human affectation , not a D ' /fy one . " Children are young , by definition . " <p> " Young is not old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old is not young , by definition , " returns the old man . " ' Old ' is defined by ' young , ' " says the D ' /fy . <p> " ' Young ' is defined by ' old , " ' says Ziomek . <p> " Define ' old ' without using ' young , " ' says the alien . It is the First Ziomek licks his lips . The rule is , Keep talking till you run out of things to say on the subject , staying within the conceptual parameters set by the partner/opponent/tutor . " Okay . ' Old ' is knowing who you are . ' Old ' is knowing where you belong . old ' is having attained a certain level of attainment and being content to stay there . ' Old ' is seeing life in all its detail from the broadest possible viewpoint . ' Old ' is acceptance of self . " Unconsciously , he sits forward in his chair , a darker vision gripping him , and looks the alien full in the face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon others for your sustenance and continued survival . ' Old ' is losing control of your body . ' Old ' is not being able to get it up . ' Old ' is crapping and pissing in your pants . " <p> " Define ' young ' without using ' old , " ' says the alien . It is the Second Challenge . " ' Young ' is being full of impulses with no restraints to channel them , " says the farmer to the D ' /fy 's bottomless eyes . " ' Young ' is not knowing your capacities . ' Young ' is incompleteness of maturation . ' Young ' is thinking more of the future than of the past . ' Young ' is not appreciating time . ' Young ' is the cruelty of ignorance . ' Young ' is not thinking you need anything but yourself . ' Young ' is Nandi my son . " He finds his voice is shaking uncontrollably . It is an old man 's voice , without a doubt . <p> " Define ' son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' father . " ' <p> " No , you bastard ! " Ziomek is on his feet , shaking his fists at the centaur . " No ! A son needs his father ! He does ! How would you people know ? You do n't even have dicks ! " He turns , shaking , and totters toward the staircase , his way out and up and into bed and sleep 's deep peace ( save for the worm ) . Well , that 's that , he thinks as he goes . Your big plan . Ha . But the Creature is there before him . " Stop , Ziomek , " it says . He stops , his chin level with the place the alien 's navel would be if it were human . He looks down at the floor . Do n't touch me , please , he prays. just do n't touch me . " You do not understand my people . We do not understand yours sometimes . Nandi does not understand us as well as he thinks he does , nor does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he here and you must tell him your wish . " " So I 'm here . " His son , behind him somewhere . " What 's going on here ? " A flash of Manafut from the Creature , and Nandi is on his haunches in front of Ziomek . " Daddy , tell me , for God 's sake . " The boy 's face is raw with emotion . They strip you of defenses , do n't they , these creatures ? thinks the old man . You ca n't speak their languages and lie . How long before you forget how to lie ? Forget how to mask entirely ? No , you will never come back . When Ziomek is silent , Nandi takes his hands and says , calmly , " Daddy , I know you do n't like the D ' /fy very much . You think they are taking me away from you . But you do n't understand . I ca n't walk away from this opportunity . It 's I , not them . Please , Daddy , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hate them because of me . " And he begins to sob , deep , terrible sobs , squatting there on the floor in front of old man Ziomek , who is suddenly embarrassed as hell and very ashamed of himself . <p> " Get up , Nandi , " he says . He pulls at his son 's hands . Nandi rises slowly . Ziomek does not let go of his hands , but steers him over to the spot where the alien is waiting . " Here you go , " says the old man . " No , do n't pretend . You may touch one another in my presence . " Bormwdthu/A-nene trills in pleasure . Silver and dark enmesh , Nandi gaping at his father , bewildered . Ziomek takes a few tottering steps backward and observes them carefully . " Well , " he says , " that fits , I guess . Now I am going upstairs and pack . " <p> " Pack ? " says Nandi . <p> " Pack . I am going with you . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ha ha , old creature ! " cries the alien . " You clever old creature , to learn all about us ! " It bounds and picks the farmer up and trots around the room with him , crowing like a crow , clucking like a chicken , quacking like a duck , bleating like Particle Accelerator III , all to Nandi 's outraged protests and a flood of laughter that gushes up in Ziomek like oil from a drillhead ( remember oil ? ) . " You knew ? " Ziomek gasps to his son-in-law . " You knew I wanted to go ? But the Third Challenge - " <p> " ' Def ine ' son ' without using ' father ' ! " shouts Bormw &thu/dnene.; " it is impossible ! Son and father belong together ! Yes this is true ! " <p> " But the Commission , " begins Nandi again , his voice very faint . " They 'll never let Dad go . It would be wonderful , but - I 'm sorry , Daddy , but you 're too old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you do n't have the science . And there 's no money for it . And - " He stops and looks at the D ' /fy , still holding Ziomek in its mighty arms . " Oh , shit . " <p> " Did you not wonder at all why I wished to accompany you to this farm ? " says the alien . " You think you study me , and get to know all about me . Well , two faces look at one another in the mirror , son of Ziomek . Your Commission will deny me nothing I require because your people wish our secrets . And as for this clever , frail creature - " it tosses the farmer up in the air and catches him effortlessly - " 1 , 1 , am Bringer of the Correct Equation ! " T <p>
