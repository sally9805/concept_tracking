<p> With all the cooking shows today , one has to wonder if the meals all those celebrity chefs are preparing on television actually taste good . <p> How would viewers know if a prep-dish flunky accidentally put salt in the sugar bowl , or if the almonds in the frangipane were stale ? It 's not as if we get to taste the stuff after the show . <p> But Ming Tsai , the PBS celebrity chef who popularized East-meets-West cuisine with his cooking shows and packaged foods at Target , swears that everything on his show tastes as good as it looks . And he vowed to prove it . <p> The former San Francisco sous chef returned home last week to tape four segments of his show , " Simply Ming All in One , " scheduled to air in the fall , with famous Bay Area food and wine personalities Hubert Keller , Joanne Weir , Michael Chiarello and Andrea Immer Robinson . <p> Tsai now lives and runs his restaurant , Blue Ginger , in Wellesley , Mass. , near Boston . Originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking in his mother 's Chinese fast-food restaurant . When Tsai was 15 , his father , now a research engineering professor at Stanford University , built him a $5,000 egg-roll cart . He 'd push it through the arcade at the Dayton mall , hawking snacks and getting phone numbers from pretty girls . <p> But when it came to his education , he followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather , and went to engineering school at Yale . The summer after his freshman year , he traveled to Paris , where he fell in love with French cuisine . <p> The following summer he returned to France , this time to attend Le Cordon Bleu culinary school . <p> " After that , I decided that I was going to be a chef , " he said while forking down pieces of hanger steak and shoestring fries at the Balboa Cafe in Cow Hollow before rushing to his shoot at the nearby home of San Francisco four-star chef Keller . " When I told my father , he said , ' Son , you were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " And now they 're so proud . Not because of my accomplishments but because they can come to my restaurant and eat for free , " Tsai joked . <p> After graduating from Yale , Tsai trained with pastry chef Pierre Herm in Paris and studied under sushi master Kobayashi in Osaka . Eventually he returned to the United States and enrolled at Cornell University , where he earned a master 's degree in hotel administration and hospitality marketing . <p> After school he moved around a bit , working in kitchens in Chicago and Atlanta and in San Francisco as a sous chef for two years at Silks in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel . It was there that he began exploring the idea of using Eastern ingredients in Western foods . <p> " I love the idea of combining crunchy and smooth , hot and cold , " he said . " I think a hot fudge sundae could well be the most perfect food . " <p> The Bay Area was also where he fell in love , got married and got his first job as executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cost at the now defunct Ginger Club in Palo Alto , but he says things did n't work out , and he left after three months . Tsai then moved to Santa Fe , N.M. , where he worked as the executive chef at the Santacafe . He had been there two years when he and his wife , Polly , started feeling the urge to move on . Tsai considered Las Vegas , where the food scene was heating up . But Polly warned , " I 'm not going from one bleeping desert town to another bleeping desert town , " remembers Tsai . <p> So when a man came into the restaurant , raved about the food and invited Tsai to come cook in Vegas , the chef had to turn him down . No matter that the man was Steve Wynn . Tsai tried out for a job at Union Pacific in New York , but Rocco DiSpirito landed the gig instead . At that point , Tsai decided to start his own restaurant , where he could mix his love for Chinese cuisine with his formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming , and Tsai 's brother lived in nearby Wellesley , a wealthy community outside the city . So he and Polly settled there and opened Blue Ginger . Ten years later , the restaurant is considered one of the most popular in the Boston area . <p> But Tsai was n't satisfied . In 2000 , he cut a deal with Target to sell his Blue Ginger line of Asian-inspired snack foods and ingredients . The line was so popular that it was expanded in 2005 to include frozen dim sum , noodle bowls , rice bowls , stir-fry kits and flavored chips and sauces . <p> In 2002 , the James Beard Foundation named Tsai the best chef in the Northeast . He had already won an Emmy for his 1998 cooking show " East Meets West With Ming Tsai " on the Food Network . Now he 's the executive producer and the host of Public Television 's " Simply Ming , " which is in its fourth season on KQED ( www.kqed.org ) . Tsai is taping his fifth season  --  26 shows in which he visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style food with an Asian ingredient . He says he likes the idea of controlling and owning his own program . <p> That was apparent on Monday , when he took over Keller 's kitchen for an episode dedicated to fermented black beans , a Chinese condiment . The task for Keller , a classic French chef , was to use the ingredient in his own creation . In no time , the chef , whose Fleur de Lys restaurant received four stars from The Chronicle , steamed up a batch of clams infused with the black beans . All the while , television cameras caught his every move . <p> Keller , who has his own cooking show on KQED , chatted back and forth with Tsai , verbally walking him through his preparation . <p> At the end of the segment , the two sat down to eat the clams . They sucked them off the shell , dipping toast points into the broth , oohing and aahing for the camera . When the lights went off , the crew members were invited to help themselves . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they looked .
