<p> Rick Down would not offer specifics , and he would not say how many phone calls he received . But at least a couple of times last season , Down , who was fired as the Yankees ' hitting coach last week , said that George Steinbrenner called him , demanding answers about the performance of certain hitters . <p> Besides the phone calls , Down had no communication with Steinbrenner , the team 's principal owner . It was different from 1993 to 1995 , when Down was the hitting coach under Manager Buck Showalter and the Yankees were more than a decade removed from their last pennant . <p> " George was a little more vocal with Buck around , " Down said this week from his home in Las Vegas . " George was less vocal after Joe won a couple of championships . Buck had n't won , and George was quite vocal and assertive . You knew he was around . He was a presence . <p> " This year , I did n't see George Steinbrenner once . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Steinbrenner kept his distance from the clubhouse , but he dialed up the pressure on Manager Joe Torre 's coaches , starting by criticizing their work ethic in an interview last winter . Three days after the Yankees lost the World Series , Down was fired and Steinbrenner was calling Don Mattingly , offering him the job . The bench coach Don Zimmer , who had fumed at Steinbrenner since last winter over a series of slights , quit rather than be fired . <p> At his introductory news conference on Tuesday , Mattingly , the former captain whose No. 23 was retired by the Yankees , said he was not naive and expected to come under fire if the hitters struggled . But Down said that Mattingly did not need to worry about angry phone calls . <p> " I think it will take awhile before he reaches out in that manner , because Donnie is a former player , he was the captain and because of the numbers he put up , " said Down , who never played in the major leagues . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Donnie . I did n't have the numbers or the career a lot of these guys had . I was an easier target . " <p> Steinbrenner has homed in on the coaching staff throughout his 30 years as the Yankees ' principal owner . Mattingly is the 15th different hitting coach since 1973 . Mel Stottlemyre , who said he felt " personally abused " by Steinbrenner last season and has not decided whether to return , is the 17th different pitching coach . Of those 32 coaches , 11 had more than one stint in that role with the Yankees . <p> The newest incarnation of the staff includes Mattingly and Luis Sojo , who played briefly for the team this year and will be the first-base coach . Sojo will also be the first Spanish-speaking member of the staff since Jose Cardenal left after the 1999 season . When Torre met privately with the struggling second baseman Alfonso Soriano during the postseason , he made sure Sojo was present . <p> Willie Randolph shifts from third-base coach to bench coach , replacing Zimmer by Torre 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltimore Orioles ' managing job , he will coach third . Rich Monteleone remains the bullpen coach , and the Yankees will have two additional pregame coaches : Gary Tuck returns to instruct the catchers , and Rob Thomson will be a special-assignment coach . <p> Steinbrenner responded to an interview request with a statement heralding the new staff and noting its youth . Down is 52 and Zimmer 72 . Mattingly is 42 , Sojo 37 . <p> " We 're going to have a new look , a businesslike approach , highly disciplined with everyone working toward a common goal and supportive of each other , " the statement said . <p> " This young staff will help give us a team that will be exciting to watch . The coaching staff is completely devoted to working with Joe Torre toward the common goal . Each one of them understands the importance of being a Yankee . " <p> Mattingly , who had resisted offers to return since his retirement in 1995 , becomes the fourth Yankees hitting coach in five years . Like Down , Mattingly would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel pretty good about myself and pretty secure , " he said at Yankee Stadium this week . " There 's nothing better than talking to a guy and helping him have success . I do n't need any attention for that . " <p> But under Steinbrenner , coaches get far more attention than they do elsewhere , with little job security and intense pressure . <p> " If there 's any pressure on anyone , it will be the pressure that every single man will have a clear understanding of going forward , " Steinbrenner 's statement said . " They 're all people who have proven they can sit the saddle . " <p> Maybe so , but the question usually is , for how long ? At least three of Steinbrenner 's managers have left over disputes involving a coach . Dick Howser quit after the third-base coach Mike Ferraro was blamed for losing the 1980 American League Championship Series ; Dallas Green took the fall in 1989 when four of his coaches were let go ; and Showalter resigned over Down 's firing in 1995 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , recognized what was happening when Steinbrenner needled Zimmer , Torre 's close ally . Zimmer said Steinbrenner blamed him for a leak to a reporter last fall , then took away his rental car in spring training and ordered the YES Network not to show Zimmer in the dugout . <p> " Zim and I were very close , " Torre said on Tuesday . " Before I got to know Zim , he and Zim were very close . That 's the sad part about this thing . For whatever reason , whether it 's a way of tweaking me , I ca n't really tell for sure . " <p> Torre later elaborated to Sporting News Radio : " When you want to get at the manager , you get at the people around him . " <p> Part of Steinbrenner 's emphasis on the coaching staff comes from his own background . Steinbrenner was an assistant football coach at Northwestern and Purdue , and he is not shy about leaning on that history when dealing with Yankees coaches . <p> " I know he talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dandy , " Down said . " But that does n't pertain to the immediate problem if the problem is the 2003 Yankees . Deal with it in the present . A lot of times there were discussions like , ' Before it was this way or that way , and it 's changed . ' Who cares ? Does that really deal with anything ? " <p> Down said he tried to stay away from gossip about Steinbrenner and buried himself in his work , never going home fully satisfied because there was always a hitter who could improve . <p> Like many hitting coaches , Down was among the first people to report to the ballpark every day , supervising early batting practice if it was scheduled or working with players privately in an indoor cage . But by game time , he said , mechanics are far less important than a player 's mental approach , a vital difference between baseball and other sports . <p> " Our sport is a little different than football or basketball , " Torre said Tuesday . " Coaching is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game is going on . You do n't do that in baseball . All of your coaching is a matter of instruction , and when the game plays , we ca n't help the players at that point . We can move them , do this and that , but in baseball , coaching is preparing players to play . " <p> Down said he had no real complaints about his tenure with the Yankees . He said Steinbrenner paid him well , and he understood the pressure all along . Down said his only wish was that he had been evaluated on the hitters ' overall performance  --  the Yankees were second in the league in on-base percentage and third in runs scored  --  and not simply the .140 average with runners in scoring position in the World Series . " You look for something , you 're going to find it , " Down said . <p> Steinbrenner found Mattingly , who will be counted on to help the Yankees do what they never did in his playing career and have not done since 2000 : win a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . <p> " Obviously , your ego would like to say that , hopefully , you can do something to help that , " Mattingly said . " But this is a great team and I really do n't have the ego that tells me I 'm that much of a difference . It 's the players that do the job , and Joe and the staff lead them there .
