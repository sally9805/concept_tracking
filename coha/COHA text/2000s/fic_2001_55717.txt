SHE WAS THEIR YOUNGEST , late born , and by the time she was eleven , the house was deep in spooky old-age quiet . She had tender breasts already and My God , what look like hips , said the Shapiro aunts , turning her around in the kitchen . Her mother and the aunts kept her well-surrounded : No dark fact could break into this picture , dirty it up or confuse it . But it was 1936 , and her father 's store was in trouble , and something else was wrong  --  his eyesight was failing , he got up to pee five times a night . Nobody spoke of it . The aunts swarmed in her mother 's parlor , clutching Clara to their bosoms , giving her big smacking kisses . " Doll , " they called her , and " Cutie-pie , " words that did n't suit her then , that never would . She felt , at the time , shunned by life , as if it did n't think her worth the effort , and was deliberately keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She imagined clawing her way out of Aunt Bea 's grasp , kicking over her mother 's Havilland dessert set , putting her boot down on a neighbor lady 's gloved fingers . But this was a secret , cherished craziness ; the opposite was what showed . One day she overheard two girls in the classroom refer to her as " Miss Goody-Two-Shoes , " and felt , for the first time , the icy , slow pull of a certain kind of anger . She stepped neatly past the girls and sat down at her desk , but she could n't forget . The scene rose up when it saw fit : in the bleak hollows of a hot afternoon , or deep in the ticking night , making the curves of her new windowshade , its dainty fringed balls , go foreign , ugly , alive . <p> The invitation to English Lake rescued her . It came in August from Elaine , a newly married cousin in Indianapolis , and was addressed , with breathtaking formality , only to her . The cream-colored envelope looked just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in loopy handwriting said : Picnics , rowing , bring a big straw hat ! Clara , it appeared , had been singled out by the only attractive person in the family . <p> Elaine had short blue-black hair and almond eyes , skin so pale it looked like cold veined marble in sunlight . The Shapiro aunts had never liked her looks . Before the wedding , Clara had heard them in the kitchen : Did anyone notice the way Elaine was allowed to wear her hair , smooth as a cap to her earlobes and bangs cut straight across ? Aunt Bea said , " Somewhere between Cleopatra and a helpless little child  --  she 's asking for it , " and when Clara said , " What 's she asking for ? " her mother shook her head . " Enough , Bea , " she 'd said . And that was that . <p> Clara 's own experience of Elaine had been confined to big occasions : a glimpse across a sea of lawn or synagogue chairs ; a pale dress and slim pumps , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pale-haired family  --  they made her want to weep . Then , at the wedding , Elaine had briefly taken notice of her . As she was carried past in her bridal chair , she 'd leaned down and whispered , " Do n't listen to anybody . " Clara flushed with pleasure  --  the mystery of this remark was supreme  --  and bowed her head as Elaine , still laughing , floated away . <p> And now English Lake . It was only fifty miles away , but a place she 'd never been . From the name , she imagined croquet hoops on a great green lawn , and her cousin Elaine reclining on a chaise longue , her delicate features hidden by a hat , teaching her how to be subtle with boys . She 'd be in a chaise longue too , right next to Elaine , glancing up from her book to see a young man watching her intently . <p> She waited for her mother to say the inevitable , " By yourself ? She 's not thinking straight  --  does n't she know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the invitation in her hand a long minute , then sighed . " I think so , this time , " she said . " A good arrangement all around . " Her face was soft , almost pleading . " Would you like to go ? " <p> Clara contained herself , nodded quietly . This was not like her mother , who watched her smallest movements , who worried about her friends , and then about her lack of friends , until it seemed easier to hide in her room with a book and forget the whole business . And it was not like her mother , either , to let Clara choose her own outfit for the train ride , the clothes to be packed in her overnight bag . Like a dream , all of it . The night before the appointed day , still picturing the great lawn and the croquet hoops , she spread her white cherry-sprigged dress on the bed alongside a creamy sweater . It looked funny there , as if somebody were in it already , laid out for death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little twisted root that kept shooting up surprises . She got into her nightie , and in her secret Girl 's Diary wrote , quite simply , " I 'm probably crazy . With any luck , I 'll be dead by thirty . " Then , in her best school cursive , the name English Lake three times . She felt much better and fell right asleep . <p> Hot , murderously hot . The dress clings to her in the silence that has followed her from her house to the sidewalk on Sycamore Street , to Main , to the train station . She can feel people watching her through lace curtains , watching her legs , her breasts too big for her age . At least nobody leans out a window to shout , " Where ya off to , Doll , with your little satchel ? " For once she slips smoothly through , and at the station window buys a ticket without being lured into conversation . Though surely there are other passengers , she will always remember the train as fantastically empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour she forgot about being watched , and looked out at the world with its untouched future , the known houses and buildings flung backwards , and her real life opening somewhere just ahead , slow and magical and private . She felt clean , unjangled : There were pears to buy , each one wrapped in tissue paper , and red-striped sacks of peanuts , and the conductor swayed through the car touching the back of each seat like a blessing , singing the names of towns . The houses along the tracks surprised her a little : sad little shacks , or what looked like old garages open to the air , and underwear on clotheslines , right out in the open . A man in overalls held a beer bottle high in salute as they passed . She waved back , and as if this were the signal he 'd been waiting for , he opened his mouth to show he had no teeth . She closed her eyes , but even then he would n't go away . <p> There was no real station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conductor singing a name she did n't know . But he stopped and touched her shoulder and said , " That would be you , Miss . " She searched through the windows for a slim , bridal beauty , but there was only a man in a white shirt and dark trousers , scanning the windows of the train . His mouth was set in a brief line of cold displeasure , and she knew , absolutely , that it had something to do with her . As she stepped down off the train in her cherry-sprigged dress , she lost her footing , and barely caught the handrail in time . There was only the glaring white background of the dress , the bloom of too-pink cherries with their fragile stems , her own pale legs and white anklets and saddle shoes  --  why had n't her mother stopped her from wearing this ? <p> " Careful now , " said the conductor . <p> " I 'm waiting for my cousin  --  " she began . <p> " You 're waiting for me , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband . " <p> Something in her began to crumble . She had n't paid attention to the bridegroom at Elaine 's wedding  --  he was simply one more man in a dark suit , either at Elaine 's side or in a cluster of other men . She had paid attention to the kiss , not to him exactly , but to the way he swooped roughly in and covered Elaine 's face so you could n't see  --  it gave her a flutter , a warmth under her skin , the way she got sometimes at movies . The Shapiro aunts had tittered later . " He 's a bit coarse , " one said , and another added , " After the honeymoon , she 'll know better . We 'll all know better . " When she 'd asked her mother if he was a nice person , her mother bit her lip and turned away . " Handsome is as handsome does . " <p> Was this man supposed to be handsome ? Because now , in the ordinary light of afternoon , his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . She was wracked by a little burst of heat , pouring through her veins ; could this be seen , somehow , on her skin ? But he had taken her satchel out of her hand and was already walking away , off to a weedy lot , where a shining brown automobile with no top waited . <p> " Thank you , " she said , and instantly regretted it , the sound of her own voice weak as a child 's . The car comforted her briefly : She 'd seen it decorated with tin cans and crepe paper at the wedding , open to the air . " Very snazzy , " her mother had said , frowning about that , too . <p> On the drive , he offered no small talk , but dropped her down into a silence that felt intimate and attractively stubborn . It occurred to her that he had been sent on exactly the sort of errand he most despised . She wanted to comfort him as she 'd seen her mother do with her father , lay her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to play chauffeur . " No , she thought , and then remembered another phrase of her mother 's : " When in doubt , keep your mouth shut . " <p> Field after yellow field , the buzz of cicadas . At last they turned onto a dirt road and began to drive under big oaks and sycamores , a pretty , filtered light . Still , it was hard to believe in a lake . After a time , she realized she was hot , and wet under the arms , and he absolutely would n't speak . Then the husband  --  she could n't remember his first name  --  swerved the car suddenly off to a little side road , and said tersely , " Here you are . " <p> There were more trees here , at least  --  clusters of big oaks , and a curved row of wooden cottages . She was briefly restored by the sight of the cottages , with their flower beds and a little grassy lawn out front , but as they drove up , something new was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandy soil , the edge of the lake itself . The husband did n't seem to care : He opened the car door formally , but once she was out , slammed it abruptly and strode away . She stood like a fool beside the flowers , then crouched closer . " Are these geraniums ? " she called out . No one answered  --  for a terrible moment she thought no one else was there . Where was Elaine ? What if she was the victim of an elaborate hoax ? Or maybe the husband was mad at Elaine too , or maybe she was holding herself aloof from him , sulking in the cabin somewhere , and that was why he was so quiet , so sullen . <p> " Smells like rotten eggs , does n't it ? " A young man or boy  --  maybe only in high school  --  stood in the doorway . He did n't wait for her to answer . " It 's sulfur . There 's hot springs under us , all over here , so it stinks like hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they could afford it . Welcome to the palace ; may I take your wraps ? " One of his front teeth was capped , and flashed silver : There was something pleasantly idiotic , disarming about it , Clara could n't say what , but it was a relief from the cold , silent judgment of the husband  --  Herb , Herb Rifkin , that was right , now she remembered . Still , she missed him being there . His silence felt strangely correct , as if she 'd asked for too much in the first place . It was , in its own way , nourishing and real , like a finger pressed against a bruise she had n't known was there before . <p> " Come on in , " the boy said . " Her Highness is seriously bored . " <p> Elaine was in fact lying stretched out on a sofa , and barely raised her head as Clara walked up . Clara felt again that little crumbling sensation , for the unforgiving light was working on Elaine 's skin , too , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they absorbed all light , were shadowed beneath . And the cottage ! It had been cheaply , haphazardly decorated with cast-off lamps and sofas , everything mustard-colored or a muddy green , and had a devastated , false feel , like a concocted setup , a facade . She looked all around . There was no accounting for the absurd distance between the formal invitation and this plaid sofa , these two men , the graceful languor of the bride gone flat . <p> Her feeling that the whole thing was a trick , a joke , came back like a wave of light . She saw her mother holding the invitation , considering , A good arrangement all around . What if her own mother was in on it , but not in the way she 'd hoped , but rather to teach her some sort of lesson about being a woman  --  that would make more sense , but why ? She had done nothing to show that she needed a lesson . She saw another door , and there was such a strained silence in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were behind it , dressed in party clothes , waiting to greet her with a great shout of " Surprise ! " Then it would all make sense ; whatever was building up would dissolve like a dream . <p> But the door remained a door . If anyone was behind it , it was Herb Rifkin , surly and fully himself , smoking , or playing a hand of solitaire , thinking nothing of them . His absence pulsed in her blood . It meant something , and none of this did ; she could not say why . The other guest introduced himself . Ed Smith , he said , little brother of a buddy of Herb 's . " I 'm your personal Boy Scout , you could say , " he said , with that brief laugh  --  it made her nervous ; she had no idea what it meant or how she should respond , so she nodded . This seemed to relax Ed a little . He bent low over something on the floor  --  a black music case  --  and brought out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , long and pale , rush over the valves . What a relief it was to watch him , his eyes closed , his attention given wholly to this thing . When he was done , he grinned at her , and the silver tooth glinted at her again , so directly she flushed and had to look away . <p> And suddenly there was Herb . She 'd missed the moment of his return . He leaned against the bedroom door , and she felt it again , the dark pull of his unhappiness , coming her way . <p> " How do you plan to entertain your cousin , now that she 's here ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't need entertaining , " Clara said , but Elaine was rousing herself , propping herself on one elbow . <p> " I think there 's a rowboat , " she said , yawning . " Or lunch  --  does that sound good ? " <p> " We ca n't all fit , " said Herb . " And it 's too early for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put up a hand like a traffic cop . <p> " Herb  --  " <p> " Baby , " he said . " We ca n't all fit in the boat . We 'd have to take turns . " Did he mean to be insulting ? What came off of him was not exactly meanness , but more like cruel , bracing intelligence . There was no flicker of hurt or surprise in Elaine 's eyes ; she met his gaze exactly . Clara realized she 'd have been sobbing already , sobbing and clawing at his T-shirt , or simply lurching out the door to freedom . Baby , he 'd called her . <p> The silence in the room was different from the muffled , invalid quiet of her house . Here there was a jagged buzz , like circus music played in the wrong key . No one else seemed dismayed . <p> " Well , " she said . " I 'm ready to do something . " She must have bowed her head submissively , for Herb laughed . " That 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm not easy , " Clara said , but Herb was n't paying attention . He was leaning over the couch , leaning over Elaine , hiding her from view the way he had during the wedding kiss , and down in her belly Clara felt a dark flare of heat , like a match struck , slowly dying out . Ed Smith lifted the trumpet to his lips and blew a long , sad reveille , but Herb and Elaine ignored the joke , as if he were , in fact , simply a musician they 'd hired for the scene . She was n't there at all  --  their kiss blotted her out completely . Now Elaine was rousing herself , putting her arms around Herb 's neck , letting him lift her as if she were a child . Herb headed for the bedroom door and kicked it open with his foot . <p> " We 'll eat when you come back , " said Elaine , laughing weakly , as Herb used his hip to press through into the room Clara was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed was standing at the cabin door , holding it open with a look of grim gallantry . <p> " Let 's go , kid , pronto , " he said , and she realized she 'd been utterly blank , gone . He had somehow put his trumpet away , and she 'd missed that , too . <p> " M'lady , " he said sternly , still holding open the door . <p> The lake was like any lake in flat country on a hot August day : not really blue , but a milky gray , the birdsong muffled , the same silence as in the cabin  --  it wanted her now , that silence . It drank from her throat and arms , the tender backs of her knees . The water lapped against the dock but was otherwise dead still as she stepped carefully into the boat , Ed Smith holding it steady . As they shoved off , the water seemed to knock at the hull like somebody at the door , polite but secretly insisting . The sky , just like the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape painting , the kind that 's called " Storm Approaching . " In this painting , the sky is white , with only the faintest outlines of thunderheads billowing up somewhere far away . You have to look a long time to see them , as if the painter has made them faint on purpose , refusing the drama . The thing is , once you see them , their gray curved outlines , you can see almost nothing else . She 'd seen one in a schoolbook ; it said the painter had actually used his thumb to spread the watercolors . Thinking about the artist 's thumb , the milky spread of color , sent another wave of sickening light through her . <p> It was n't unfamiliar , this color , this feeling . It belonged to hot summer days in her own life , days when she 'd come into the house from playing , not saddened , for once , by the quiet and the dark . And for a moment she 'd be happy : The wood floor was cool on her bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison of sky had vanished , and she was free . Then a little sound would break in  --  a toilet flushing , a tap turned on , a doorhandle turned  --  and she would see her father in the hall , home early from the store again , shuffling around the corner , the tail of his nightshirt disappearing last . She stood still , listening hard , but there was nothing more . He had gone back to bed . Later her mother would come into the parlor and put a hand on her arm . " Can you go outside and play a little more ? " she 'd ask . " Papa needs to rest . " And Clara would leave the house again , with no plan , nowhere to go but outside into the hot light that had no end . <p> This was what she felt now , alone with the silver-toothed boy on the lake . He rowed steadily , as strangely colorless as the lake and the day . He was too pale for summer . If somebody painted him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and pale eyes . <p> Rowing , thank God . As long as he was silent , busy with the work of rowing , she felt all right , though faintly aware that she was trying to survive something , the length of time it would take them to get back to shore . She found herself hoping he 'd just row , and never say a word to her the whole time  --  not one word . <p> But no sooner had she thought this , of course , than he opened his mouth . The tooth glinted dully , like old pewter , no longer pleasant or silly . She was alone in a boat with a boy  --  and out of nowhere she recalled a phrase of her mother 's , " They have a capacity "  --  though for what , her mother had not said . She remembered only the way her mother had snapped her fingers and said , " Like a match ! " Capacity  --  the word itself was a gap , a rip in the blank surface of the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , or looked away suddenly  --  something , anyway , that communicated her fear to him . She might have moved her feet without thinking , but in any case he was leaning back with the oars , and she saw his pale arms twitch with the pull ; just at his ribs the T-shirt lifted slightly and fell , lifted and fell , until a moment when she snapped out of it . She 'd been staring again . And now he looked back at her , that colorless , passive gaze , and in what seemed a mere second , let go the oars and stripped off his shirt . <p> " Apologies , " he said , grinning . " If apologies are in order . " <p> Her heart thrummed with a high , hot speed . " Pardon , " she said , to gain time . It was like a dream , the kind where you 're onstage , in a play of some sort , and everybody knows their lines but you . She looked out at the lake , but it defied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet , like corrugated metal of those houses by the train tracks . <p> " Elaine was n't kidding about you , " he said . " And it 's OK , you do n't have to play Miss Priss with me  --  " <p> Now she looked at the lake in earnest , trying to imagine what Elaine had said about her . She barely knew Elaine ; what could she possibly say that would be true ? In accordance with the strange plot , the shoreline had vanished . Of course he might simply be rowing them farther out , to a place where they could never be seen , never be heard . The disappearance of the shore , its weeds and ferns and scrubby trees , seemed more terrible than anything . <p> He stood up and tugged lightly at his pants , and knowledge flooded her veins . Later it would dawn on her that he might have been merely readjusting himself on the seat . But not then . Surely he was about to push her into the wet puddle at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see . There would be his man 's thing , briefly exposed , then a terrible pressure , sharp as a knife . She knew this absolutely . <p> Her speed amazed her : It was as if some force had come to her aid , for a light breeze from nowhere sprang up , rocking them , giving her the idea . She planted her feet slightly apart , with a kind of delicate , brilliant pleasure , a hot light in her ribs , and ever so gently began to rock the boat side to side , side to side , the way , she thought , a cradle should be rocked . Only the more she rocked , the more she felt the pleasure of doing it , its rhythmic , musical purity . This , and only this , was right . <p> " Hey , hey , " said Ed Smith , gripping the sides of the boat , but she rocked one great snap harder , and over he went , right over the side , crashing heavily into the water . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then spat hugely at the side of the boat , but she could n't be stopped now . The feeling was new , and big , a blue flame fanning itself higher and higher , pure and exact . She saw her mother again , holding the invitation . She saw Herb at the station , and Elaine lying like an opera star on the couch . No , she thought wildly . What an amazing word it was , standing all alone , a sword , a flame , gorgeous and all hers . <p> " Hey , come on , hey , " he cried . " Damn it , ! forgot your name . You 're nuts ; bring the boat over here . " <p> " No , " she said . " You can swim . " <p> She got herself into the tower 's seat , grasped the oars , and began to make for shore , though she had no idea , in that milky light , where shore might be . <p> She found it sooner than she thought she would  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment , a faint taste of metal in the mouth . No matter what she did next , it would n't be the end of the story . She was pretty sure she had n't killed him , but she did n't trust the weird silence of the lake , either : Possibly he had some supernatural ability to hold his breath , and would , at any minute , appear beneath the boat and topple her . This was why she got out when she did , abandoned the boat and wound up in the muddy , tangled grasses along the shore , soaked to the waist , covered with tiny bits of green muck , as if every sticky thing in the lake had attached itself to her . She looked down at her dress , the soaked bodice gone pink from cherries , and began to shake . Anybody who saw her now would know that she was a helpless , muddy girl who 'd nearly been violated , and was now lost in an unfamiliar place without anyone she really knew . Would n't they ? Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She emerged onto dry land , a sorry little glade of scrub oaks . What was she expecting ? A medieval forest , great towering trees and shafts of sunlight , a deep contrast of light and dark ? Because it was starting to feel exactly the opposite : grimy and confusing and meaningless . Her own act kept rising up instead of Ed Smith 's . It dawned on her now that he , in fact , had committed no act  --  nothing at all . <p> Then cabin rooftops , not far away at all , but cut off from her by brambles and high grass . She stopped walking and stood still a moment , trying to get her legs to stop trembling , and that was when she heard it , felt it under her feet : a deep , regular thudding behind her , from the direction of the lake . It had to be . She felt a wretched calm , flatly neutral , as if her life were already over . It was almost a relief . Dead by thirty . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what her mother meant  --  capacity  --  and she thought , this is what must come , this , and nothing else . She turned to face it  --  nothing less than her deserved destiny of violent ravagement and death by God knows what enormous monster  --  and saw a cow . It was a dirty white cow , chewing and moving steadily forward , glancing at her sideways with a doleful , irritated look . The relief was tremendous , as if a trigger had been touched , and she screamed , to her own ears a goofy horror-show scream that came back at her from the lake , for the whole world to hear . <p> The cow looked at her long and slow . It summed her up , dismissed her , then swung its head away and began to eat . For a moment she stood stunned , her insufficiency trembling and real , and then she ran  --  ran straight out of the glade and onto a road . <p> It had been there all along , the road . And the cottages themselves were within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of them . As she came closer , she heard dishes clattering , a child 's sudden cry . It was her own rowing , not Ed Smith 's , that had carried her straight back to them , the one time in her life that she needed to be missed , lost for several hours in the wilderness . <p> But Ed Smith was already at the cottage when she got there , and Elaine was lying on the couch again , with Herb leaning over her . For a split second Clara wondered if she 'd dreamed it all  --  everything from the moment of Herb 's lifting Elaine from the couch and carrying her off  --  because Elaine looked as pale and miserably self-absorbed as before . If there was anything different , it was that they were all looking at her now , with barely contained smiles . It did n't take long for her to realize that the story  --  Ed 's version of it , anyway  --  had long since been told , and they had feasted on it , had a good laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play cards and eat a big lunch . She thought dimly of maidens , virgins , the way they were sacrificed in the old days , as part of a special festival of harvest . You burned her with special ceremony , and then ate a big dinner . <p> " Thank you for a nice time , " she said . " I 'm leaving now . " <p> Ed was grinning openly at her now , and she saw that he was n't even angry , that the biggest action of her life was a joke to him , its outcome known all along . It seemed crucial to her dignity , to whatever hope she had of being believed back home , not to look at him ever again . It seemed important not to look at anyone , though she felt , dimly , thai Elaine was trying to get her attention , picking up a handkerchief and blowing her nose daintily , showily , like some crazy echo of Ed 's reveille . It was distracting , as was the faint recognition that Elaine 's robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it a small dark-blue stain , like a birthmark , or ink . It made her feel a little sick ; why did n't Elaine cover it up ? <p> " I really must go . Thank you for inviting me , " she said , holding herself erect . <p> " Thank my wife , " said Herb , shrugging . " You want to clean up before you go ? " <p> She was dizzy . Elaine had n't paid any attention to her at all . She was practically invisible in Elaine 's eyes . <p> " Why did you invite me ? " she cried . <p> Elaine raised herself on one elbow , and for a second looked as if she might speak . Then , to Clara 's amazement , she fell back on the couch , and a tear  --  ridiculous  --  came down her cheek . <p> Herb looked at Elaine , and it seemed to Clara that his cheeks reddened . " Listen , kid , never mind . I 'll give you a lift . " <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . " <p> He sighed . " What is it with this family ? I 'll get the keys . " She nodded without looking at him , and collected her things . In her satchel was a change of clothes , but she did n't want to change anything  --  why ? To punish Elaine , and to give her mother the full show of her bravery ? She only knew that she wanted to stay in the muddy dress as long as possible . <p> On the way to the station , he never looked at her . She knew this though she kept her own head rigidly still , facing out the window the whole time . At the station he opened the door for her , and asked , in a curt voice , if she had a ticket . " Of course , " she said . Then , for a moment , he said nothing , and silence hung like a third party between them . She was aware of nothing but his body , his shoulders and arms , even the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The swiftness and surprise of the way he 'd lifted Elaine from the couch . She shivered , and looked away , afraid he 'd see . <p> " I need to ask you something , " he said , his voice suddenly warm , and directed only at her . She nodded . " OK , " he said . " Do n't tell your mother about Elaine , the crying and so on . It 'll just complicate things for us . " <p> She nodded again . It was hard , with him so close , to think about Elaine  --  she kept fading from the picture . All she wanted was for him to say one thing about what had happened to her . She tried to will him to . But he only laid his hand on her shoulder , a brief heat through her sleeve . He tipped his hat and turned to go . <p> She kept her head high all the way to the platform , and sat down to wait without looking back . And though he was long gone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift her feet . Not until the train was safely out of the station , and the conductor was standing beside her , asking for her ticket , did she begin to tremble . It was the same conductor as before ! As she handed him her ticket , he tilted his head at her so familiarly that she broke into sobs . " I fell in the lake , " she said . " I was pushed  --  " <p> " That 's all right , young Miss , " he said , with a little smile . " You 're miles from the water now . " <p> Then he was gone , and the trip reversed itself , the repetition of houses and shacks and garages , no one outside now , and she was glad . She kept trying to call up the purity of the first ride , before anything , but with no warning it was Elaine who was with her , nothing would come but a picture of Elaine lying down , crying in front of her , as if she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , too , in her muddy virgin 's costume , the way she 'd stood in the middle of the room trying to look angry and offended . Her own story fell away , leaving only Elaine , and the message she 'd failed to grasp . Her own nod of complicity , the heat of Herb 's palm through her sleeve . <p> Only now . In the dark , on the train , she sees what she 's capable of , and even as she sees it , she can already feel herself being carried away from it , back into safety , blindness . So for once she 's glad no one knows she 's coming , that no one is there to see her shame . She can feel its contours , its life inside her . She 'd like to feel it , all alone , a little longer . She sees herself as a camera would : a girl disembarking from a train in a muddy dress with little threads of algae hanging down , her white , narrow face with its dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , specter , ghost of her own life , she moves down Sycamore Street , glad to be outside all those lives and windows . A woman walks from one room into the next . It is a house she knows , but she ca n't think of the name of the woman leaning over the chair , folding a blanket . The name will not come to her , the name does n't seem to matter , only the way the light strikes at the pale underside of the woman 's arm . <p> In this state she walks right past her own house . It takes her ages to realize it , and walk back , trying to hold onto the truth as it slips down through her body , and away . Her house is already dark  --  the only one on her street already dark  --  and the wide feeling inside her is beginning to fail . But she holds onto it as she goes around to the back door , stepping over the threshold into the life her parents inhabit without her . A creak on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll surrender to habit , telling her story , with all its false , childish drama , concealing the first adult truth of her life , Elaine 's faint blue stain . Tiny , negligible , the only real thing . <p> Her mother is in the hall now , feeling the wall for the light-switch . It 's still dark , but Clara sees the sad curve of her shoulders , the way the fingers tremble against the wall . " Clara , child , is it you ? " cries her mother , and Clara hears the familiar high edge of her panic . But something else now , too . The coming grief , the burden of secrets . <p> Sudden light , and her mother 's voice again , like a tide coming . " My God , sweetheart , what happened ? We were n't expecting you  --  " <p> " I know , Mother , " says Clara , beginning to cry . " But here I am . " <p> <p> By Marjorie Sandor <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
