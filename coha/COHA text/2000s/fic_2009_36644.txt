1 <p> Whole Lotta Shakin ' Going On <p> The things I believe in can be counted on one hand  --  even if that hand were two-fifths occupied with , say , smoking a cigarette , or making a bunny for a shadow puppet show , or forming " devil horns " at a heavy metal concert . The things I believe in boil down to three major categories : <p> 1 . Rock ' n ' roll . <p> 2 . Vampires . <p> 3 . A damn good pair of shoes . <p> <p> Number two came about when one bit me , in the middle of what could nonskankily be called an " intimate encounter . " Number three came later , when I gained the identity and thus the possessions of my dead-undead boss Elizabeth Vasser , owner of WVMP , the Lifeblood of Rock ' n ' Roll . <p> I 'm two people , but only on paper . In real life , I 'm just Ciara Griffin , underpaid marketing manager and not-paid miracle worker for a vampire radio station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself . <p> The Smoking Pig is packed with fans who chose to spend Halloween Eve  --  aka Hell Night , Mischief Night , or Tuesday  --  in a bar with their favorite DJs , the ones who whisk them through time into another era , and into a world where vampires just might exist . <p> I lean back against the brass bar rail to avoid getting trampled by a couple dressed as Marilyn Monroe and Marilyn Manson . The guy in the Monroe costume ca n't be more than twenty-one , but he 's twisting to a fifty-year-old tune with as much enthusiasm as his grandfather probably did . <p> Above me , the station 's long black banner hangs on one of the rustic pub 's long wooden crossbeams . Draped with fake cobwebs , it features our trademark logo , an electric guitar with two bleeding fang marks . <p> The two Marilyns jostle me again , and I reach up to check the status of my mile- high dark blond ponytail . Wearing a floral blouse and matching " skort " as twenty percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad the crowd provides plenty of heat . October in Maryland shows no mercy to beachwear . <p> " Excuse me , " shouts a voice to my left , straining to be heard over Jerry Lee Lewis 's slammin ' piano . <p> I peer over rosy-lensed sunglasses at a young man about my age and height  --  midtwenties , five-eightish , with a lanky frame verging on heroin-chic thin . <p> " The bartender said I should speak to you , " he says . <p> I examine his swooping bleach-blond hair , skinny jeans , and faded Weezer T-shirt . The smudged black guyliner makes his hazel eyes pop out behind a pair of round glasses . <p> " Billy Idol meets Harry Potter . I like it . " <p> He puts a hand to his ear . " What ? " <p> " Your costume , " I shout , my voice already raw after only an hour of partying . <p> He gives a twitchy frown and shifts the messenger bag slung over his left shoulder . " I 'm Jeremy Glaser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to do a story on your station . " <p> Oops . I guess it 's not a costume . <p> Jeremy extends a heavily tattooed arm toward the rear wall of the Smoking Pig , away from the stage and the speakers . " Can we talk ? " <p> I reach back to the bar for my ginger ale . " Interviews by appointment only . Give me your e-mail and  --  " <p> " It 's a freelance assignment for Rolling Stone . " <p> My glass slips , and I spill soda down my arm . " Whoa ! " I shake the liquid off my hand and grab a bar napkin . " I mean , wow . " <p> He gestures for me to join him at the back of the Pig . This time I do n't hesitate . <p> We weave through the crowd toward a dark corner , my espadrilles sticking in the booze puddles . I take the opportunity to rein in my galloping ambition and figure out how to play my hand . <p> Why did n't this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always my first guess , due to my own former occupation ) , or he 's committing journalistic ambush to see if we 'll embarrass ourselves . <p> " So what 's the angle ? " I ask him over my shoulder . <p> " The first issue of the New Year will focus on the death of independent radio . " He turns to me as we reach the back wall . " You guys are putting up a valiant battle against the inevitable . " <p> " Thanks . I guess . " I hand him my business card . " Ciara Griffin , marketing and promotions manager . " <p> " I know who you are . " He examines my card in the light of a dancing skeleton lantern , then jots a note under my name . " Keer-ah , " he mumbles , noting the correct pronunciation . <p> I keep my smile sweet . " Could I take a peek at your credentials ? " <p> He pulls a handful of folded paper from his bag 's outside pocket . " The one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other pages are e-mails discussing the nature of the story . " <p> I angle the paper to the light . " How does a journalism student snag such a major gig ? " <p> " My professor has a connection . " He adjusts his glasses with his middle finger . " Also , I can be pushy . " <p> " I like pushy . " I hand him back the papers . " In fact , I 'd like to buy pushy a drink . " <p> My best friend Lori swoops by with a trayful of empty glasses and " horrors d'oeuvres " plates . I reach out to stop her  --  gently , due to her momentum and the breakable items . She 's dressed as another twenty percent of the Go-Go 's , a small black Jane Wiedlin wig covering her white-blond hair . <p> " Hey , Ciara . " She sends her words to me but aims her perky smile at Jeremy . <p> " Lori , I know you 're busy , but can you get this gentleman from Rolling Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever he 'd like to drink ? Bill it to the station . " <p> " I ca n't accept , " he says , impervious to her cute . " Conflict of interest . " <p> " Put it on my personal tab , " I tell her . " A drink between new friends . " <p> She beams at him . " There 's a dollar-a-pint Halloween special on our dark microbrew . " <p> He hesitates . " Do you have any absinthe ? " <p> " Um , I 'll check . " Lori tries not to laugh as she looks at me . " Another ginger ale ? " <p> " Definitely . " <p> Lori winks before walking away . She knows I always stay more sober than my marks . <p> I take the last sip of my flat soda to wet my drying mouth . Dealing with the press is usually the jurisdiction of my immediate boss , Franklin , the sales and publicity director . Despite great effort , he 's never raised the interest of a national publication , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our laps , waiting for me to fill them with fascination . <p> Jeremy crosses his arms and examines me , in a skeptical pose right out of All the President 's Men . " So what gave you the idea to start this vampire DJ gimmick ? " <p> " It 's not a gimmick . They 're really vampires . " I offer an ironic smile . " They 're each stuck in the time they were ' turned , ' which is why they dress and talk like people from back in the day . " I point to the stage , where a tall man with slicked-back auburn hair surveys his poodle-skirted , ponytailed groupies through a pair of dark sunglasses . " Spencer , for instance , became a vampire in Memphis in the late fifties . He was around when Sun Records discovered Elvis Presley , Johnny Cash , Carl Perkins , all those guys . " He sends the girls a fake-shy smile as he arranges his stack of 45s . " Spencer was there at the birth of rock ' n ' roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midwives . " <p> Jeremy looks at me like I 've just recited my grocery list . He has n't written any of this down . " My research says you came up with this Lifeblood of Rock ' n ' Roll thing in a desperate effort to boost ratings . " <p> " It was either that or get bought out by Skywave . " I still have corporate-takeover nightmares , where my fanged friends are forced to spin Top 40 hits until they stake themselves in despair . " Something wrong with trying to survive ? " <p> " No , it 's genius . " He checks out the Lifeblood of Rock ' n ' Roll banner . " But how long can it last ? " <p> " Well ... " I scratch my nose to cover my wince . Despite our rabid fan base , ratings since the summer have tanked . The public at large is beginning to yawn and look for the Next Big Thing . <p> It does n't help that the DJs do n't look or act like stereotypical vampires . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guzzle beer , bourbon , and tequila than sip red wine . They do n't brood , except about having to record promos for car dealerships and power vacs . They never attend the opera . <p> And as much as the vampires enjoy their adoring audiences , they want to keep their real nature secret , to avoid the inevitable mass freakout and subsequent stake-fest . Survival is paramount , and without WVMP , our vampires would losetheir sun-shielded home under the station . Not to mention their whole reason for " living " : the music . <p> " It can last forever , " I tell Jeremy . " Rock ' n ' roll will never die . Just like vampires . " <p> A muscle near his eye twitches  --  the classic journalist spare-me-the-spin facial tic . <p> Lori arrives with our drinks . " Sorry , no absinthe . Hope beer 's okay . " <p> " Whatever . " Jeremy accepts his drink and hands her two dollars . " Keep the change . " <p> Ignoring his refusal of my generosity , I raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . " <p> He clinks and sips , then nearly spits the experimental dark microbrew back into the glass . There 's a reason they sell it for a buck . <p> He wipes the foam from his mouth with a bar napkin . " I noticed that after the last ratings report you cut your advertising rates by ten percent . Sounds like you 're having trouble holding the public 's attention and it 's hurting your bottom line . " <p> " Every business has its ups and downs . " <p> " But commercial radio is hopeless . How can you compete with downloads and satellite stations ? " He raises his multi-studded eyebrows . " What 's next , werewolves ? " <p> I ignore the jest . " We 'll compete the same way radio stations always have  --  by providing a unique experience and quality entertainment . " <p> Jeremy does n't record those weasel words . I scan the bar , hoping to see David our general manager , or another DJ  --  anyone who can impress this guy . <p> The front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on . " I beckon Jeremy to follow me . " Meet our star . " <p> The reporter looks past me and his jaw drops , transforming his face from cyni-cool to little-kid glee . " Yeah , yeah . That 'd be great . " <p> As I push through the crowd , I glance back to see Jeremy close behind me , frantically flipping the pages of a small notebook . <p> By the time I get to the door , Shane is surrounded by a gaggle of college girls . Towering over them at six-five , he greets them with an easy grin , but when his gaze rises to meet mine , his pale blue eyes light up with such force , the groupies ' smiles turn to scowls . <p> The women look over their shoulders at me . One is dressed as Courtney Love , in a white baby-doll dress , black combat boots , and smeared mascara  --  presumably to appeal to grunge-boy Shane . As I pass through the gauntlet , she gives me and my costume a glare that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then pull him close to speak in his ear . " This guy 's from Rolling Stone . " <p> He tilts his chin to look at me , eyes wide but holding a hintof suspicion . " You 're kidding . " <p> " I 've never lied to you . " He 's the only one I can say that about . I turn to introduce the reporter . " Jeremy Glaser  --  " <p> " Shane McAllister , " Jeremy says , then reaches forward and pumps Shane 's hand hard enough to hurt a mere human . " I love your show . I listened to it back when I went to Sherwood College , in your pre-vampire days . Your indie-grunge mix is so eclectic , and yet you tie it all together seamlessly . It 's inspiring . " <p> Shane 's reticence melts in the face of the reporter 's worship . " Wow . I mean , thanks . " He sweeps his tangle of pale brown hair off his face in a self-conscious motion . " I mean , good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview ? " <p> " Seriously ? " Shane smoothes the front of his flannel shirt . " Me ? " <p> " He 'll meet you over there in a sec . " I look at Jeremy and point to the place where we were just talking . The reporter salutes with his little notebook and hurries to the back of the bar . <p> Shane squeezes my elbow . " You look cute tonight . " <p> " Tonight ? " <p> " Always . " He sneaks a kiss , and I ca n't resist stretching it into an unprofessional public display of affection . Finally , with an audible sigh , Shane pulls away and speaks low in my ear . " So what should I tell this guy ? " <p> " He says his angle is the struggle of independent radio , so give him your authenticity spiel and how radio should be all about the music . " I hook my pinky into the belt loop of his faded ripped jeans . " You know , the stuff I find so adorable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushing my ear with a breath warm enough to prove he had his fill of , uh , sustenance before the party . " What about the undead issue ? The standard ' pretend to be a human pretending to be a vampire ' routine ? " <p> " Yes , with lots of wink-winks . Your usual ironic self . " <p> " Got it . " He gives my cheek a quick kiss before heading off to join Jeremy . <p> Bill Riley 's " Flying Saucer Rock ' n ' Roll " fades out , and Spencer 's honey-smooth drawl comes out of the speakers . <p> " Ladies and gentlemen , we got two hours left till Halloween . Time for me to say good night , but I 'm gon na turn it over to my great friend , Mississippi Monroe Jefferson . " The crowd whistles and hollers , especially the older members . Spencer continues , " He 'll play you some blues that I guarantee 'll send a shiver down your spine . " <p> He steps aside and adjusts the microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair behind him , like in a magic trick . Another cheer . The stage light makes Monroe 's suit glow white , setting off his smooth ebony skin and the lustrous scarlet of his acoustic guitar . <p> Monroe lets loose with a weepingly beautiful version of Robert Johnson 's " Me and the Devil Blues . " I smile at the choice ; the story of his turning is well known by his fans . Like several legendary musicians of his place and time , Monroe supposedly went to the crossroads at midnight to meet with the devil , to trade his soul for the ability to master the blues . A vampire was waiting for him , and the rest is history . <p> The blues always makes me want to drink , so I head to the bar and signal to Stuart , the owner of the Smoking Pig , who is making a valiant attempt to look like Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran . <p> He slides a bottle of my favorite beer across the bar . " How 's it going with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to impress than the general public . " I watch him light a cigarette . " Any luck on that smoking ban waiver ? " <p> Stuart shakes his head in disgust . " I sent the state a photo of the sign hanging over our front door . I said , ' If you look closely , you 'll notice that under the words " The Smoking Pig " is an illustration of a pig with a cigarette . ' They did n't care . " He takes a hostile puff . " Fascists . " <p> " So what are you going to do ? " <p> " Set up an outdoor lounge with space heaters . It 'll cost a fortune . " <p> " Hey , Ciara , " comes a voice at my elbow . Lori sidles close and adjusts the poof of my ponytail . " I remember that guy Jeremy from my History of the Middle East class senior year . Smart , but kinda intense . He said he hoped the Iraq War lasted long enough for him to be an embedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I watch him in the corner speaking with Shane , scribbling madly in his notebook . Shane maintains a casual posture against the wall , but his supernatural stillness creates a magnetic field that seems to have snagged the journalist . " I do n't like it . " <p> " Why not ? " she asks me just as Monroe finishes his song to a rush of applause . " Do n't you want the publicity ? " <p> " I want fawning puff pieces about how cool it is to be a vampire . I do n't want someone to find out the truth . " <p> Lori hurries off to pick up an order as Monroe begins another song . I watch his fingers glide over the strings like a water bug skimming a pond . He makes it look so easy . Shane tried to teach me guitar last month  --  I stopped after two days and ten blisters . <p> A familiar arm slides over my shoulders . I lean into Shane and crane my neck to look behind him . " Where 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw twitches in contemplation . " I think he wants to be bitten . " <p> " Lori said he was weird . Are you sure ? " <p> Shane nods . " A vampire can smell an eager donor a mile away . " <p> " Do I need to forbid you to bite a reporter ? " <p> He slants me a gimme-a-break look . " I 'm not that dumb . Anyway , I do n't think he thinks I 'm really a vampire . " <p> " Because that 's insane . " <p> " I think he thinks I 'm a wannabe . " <p> Ah yes . In the " real " vampire subculture , some humans believe they need to drink blood to thrive , and there are people lined up to oblige them . Lacking fangs , they use razors or needles to bleed their " donors . " <p> Some of those donors find their way to a real-real vampire , and if they can be trusted to hide the truth , the two form a symbiotic relationship . The donors exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masochistic thrill of serving a creature who could rip off their heads . <p> Not for me . The sensation of being stabbed with a pair of ice picks does nothing for my self-esteem or libido . <p> At a minute to midnight , my boy takes over the stage from Monroe , who tips his hat to the worshipping crowd on his way out . No one dares to follow . Like Spencer and other older vampires , Monroe 's charisma holds an edge of menace that sane people wisely avoid . It 's why we ask them to wear sunglasses in public whenever possible . <p> Shane , on the other hand , exudes humanity , giving his admirers a friendly wave as he moves to the microphone . " Ladies and gentlemen , the time is twelve a.m . It is now . Officially . Halloween . " <p> He hits a switch and a low , hypnotic bass emanates from the speaker  --  the opening moments of Concrete Blonde 's " Bloodletting . " The patrons writhe and vamp , reveling in the dark magic the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to see Lori leaning out of the kitchen , holding on to the edge of the swinging door . <p> " What 's up ? " I ask as I follow her into the kitchen . <p> She takes me behind the salad prep area , where an old boom box sits on a shelf . She turns up the volume . Above the clatter of pans and the sizzle of grease , I hear an angry male voice . <p> "  --  ' not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness , but instead even expose them , ' as Paul told the Ephesians . " He lets that sink in . " Do n't let the secular media and your children 's public school teachers convince you that Halloween is harmless fun . Your tolerance is their greatest weapon in this culture war . Fact : Halloween is a pagan holiday that glorifies darkness and evil and everything God wants us to fight . " <p> I glance past her at the chef/dishwasher , who 's searing a pair of burgers on the grill , then at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " When did Jorge get born again ? " <p> Lori shakes her head . " It 's supposed to be WVMP . " <p> " No , it 's just mistuned . " I twist the grease-encrusted knob , searching for the station . " The antenna probably got knocked . " <p> " I already tried that . I was here when it happened , just now . " She points to the wall clock , which reads a minute after midnight . " Regina was giving her usual creepy intro , then suddenly it was this guy . " <p> I tweak the dial again and again , but there 's no Regina , no Bauhaus , no Sex Pistols . Just a whole lotta Jesus goin ' on . <p> " I better get David . " <p> The kitchen door sweeps inward , banging into the stainless steel dishwasher . My boss stalks toward us , dressed as Bruce Springsteen circa Born in the U.S.A. , cell phone at his ear . As David passes me , I hear a woman 's screech from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shuts the phone as he stomps up to the radio , the bandanna around his ripped blue jeans flapping with each step . <p> " She 's not on , " I tell him . " It 's some guy nutting off about Satan . " <p> David adjusts the knob up and down , only to get another dose of Ranty Man . <p> He curses under his breath . " Regina said she 's flooded with calls . " <p> " It happened exactly at midnight , " Lori offers . <p> " Strange . " David stares at the boom box . " It 's like another station was just created on the same frequency . " <p> " Is n't that illegal ? " I ask him . <p> " Extremely . " He rubs the dark , uneven stubble on his chin , a look he 's been working on for a week ( and , if I may say , that has been worth the wait ) . " If it 's a pirate operation , the FCC could slap them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in jail . " <p> " Then what are we waiting for ? Let 's report them . " <p> He gives me a patronizing glare , like I 've suggested we call up Santa Claus . " Ciara , the FCC does n't exactly have a twenty-four-hour emergency number . We 'll have to file a report during business hours . " <p> " What if it 's not pirates ? " I gesture to the radio . " It sounds too high-quality to be coming out of someone 's basement . What if it 's another real station ? " My mind sounds the cha-ching ! of a cash register . " Can we sue them ? " <p> David turns away , dark brows furrowed . " If it 's a real station , " he murmurs , " I might be able to find out ... " He looks at Lori . " Can I use your boss 's computer ? " <p> She points to the back of the kitchen . " There 's Stuart 's office . Sorry about the mess . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call Regina , tell her to get the location of everyone who ca n't hear us . " <p> I return to the bar , where Shane is onstage and on the phone . He pulls his head away from the phone , as if it 's delivering electric shocks . <p> I weave through the crowd to the edge of the stage , then mouth the word " Regina ? " to him . Shane nods . Good thing his eardrums are as immortal as the rest of him . <p> I signal for him to hand me the phone . He shakes his head but obliges . " Be careful ! " he shouts . <p> I move away from the speakers to hear Regina . Unnecessary . Astronauts on the International Space Station can probably hear her . <p> " Hey , it 's me , " I say as calmly as I can . " David says to find out the locations of all the callers who ca n't hear us . " <p> " Do n't you think I thought of that ? " Regina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere  --  D.C. , Sherwood , Baltimore , Harrisburg , every town in between . This is n't some half-assed pirate operation . Someone is fucking with me . " <p> " I doubt it 's personal . It 's probably just an anti-Halloween demonstration by religious wackos . David says he might find out who it is by looking on the Internet . " <p> There 's a long pause before her voice comes back , muted . " Really ? " <p> Regina died in 1987 , so her entire experience of the Internet consists of the Matthew Broderick movie War Games . To her , the Web is omnipotent , able to produce tragedies and miracles with a few keywords . <p> " Go on with the show as if nothing 's happened , " I tell her , " and we 'll be at the station after the bar closes at two . " <p> She gives a tight sigh . " I wish I could figure out how to blame you for this . " <p> I hang up the phone as Jeremy approaches me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks . <p> " Of course . Why ? " <p> " The way you and the station manager were running around , it looks like there 's a crisis . " <p> " Nope . " I adjust my sunglasses . " No crisis . " <p> " You mean , other than the fact that no one can hear your broadcast ? " In response to my stunned look , he holds up his own phone . " My roommate just texted me . " <p> Crap . How many other media outlets have noticed already ? How many advertisers have noticed ? <p> He steps closer , a new gleam in his eye . " Let me help you find the pirate . " <p> " I do n't think so . " That 's all we need , for him to snoop around and discover the real truth . " Thanks , anyway . " I pat his arm and turn toward the stage . <p> " This could be a huge story , " he says . <p> I stop . Visions of the station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover of Rolling Stone form a slide show in my head . Visions of solvency . Visions of survival . <p> I turn back to Jeremy . " Give us a day to put our own people on it . I 'll get you something Thursday morning . " <p> " Exclusive ? " <p> " Through the weekend . " <p> " Good enough . " He tucks his notebook back into his pocket . " I 'm going to drive back home to College Park and listen myself . I 'll call you Thursday . " <p> On my way back to the kitchen , I wing Shane 's cell phone toward the stage . He snags it with a deft maneuver . <p> In Stuart 's dim office , I find David leaning close to the monitor , his worried face aglow in the pale white light . He gives me a distracted glance as I pick my way through the piles of papers and stacks of shrink-wrapped Halloween bar napkins . <p> " Found something odd . " David points to the screen . " The FCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for a translator construction permit from earlier this month right here in Sherwood . " <p> " A what construction ? " <p> " Translator . It 's a two-way antenna that takes a radio signal and transmits it way outside the station 's original range . Let 's say we wanted to broadcast in Poughkeepsie . We 'd build translator stations to relay the signal , and then everyone between here and there could hear us . " <p> " But we could n't trample on another station 's frequency , right ? " <p> " Right . To stay legal , we 'd have the translator change our frequency to one that 's available in our target area . If we 're - 94.3 here , we might be 102.1 in Scranton . " <p> I squint at the browser to see what looks like an application from a Family Air Network , Inc . " But these people did n't bother switching . " <p> " No , they bothered . " David highlights a box on the application . " They specifically requested our frequency . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at me . " They 're after us . " <p> " They 're after me . I knew it ! " <p> Black leather creaking , Regina paces across the small main office of the radio station . As she rants , she stabs the air with a long brown cigarette and shoots hostile glances from her dark brown eyes , outlined in liquid black . <p> Sitting on either side of my desk , David and I share a glance that mixes relief and confusion . The moment Shane signed on with his Whatever broadcast at 3 a.m. , the religious screed ended . Maybe Regina is the target . <p> Rob Zombie 's " Dragula " pounds out of the speaker that sits under the mounted deer head on the opposite wall . I smile , mentally giving Shane points for every time he plays a song that was released after he died . The DJs stuck-in-time phenomenon is n't a gimmick  --  it 's a sad fact of unlife . <p> One of their gig posters hangs on the wall above my desk , displaying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life Times " : Monroe , the 1940s bluesman ; Spencer , purveyor of ' 50s rockabilly ; Jim , who brings us the dark , psychedelic side of the ' 60s ; Noah , the dreadlocked reggae dude representing the 1970s ; Regina , the ' 80s punk/Goth chick ( and the only one who actually looks like a vampire ) ; and youngest of all , Shane , whose broadcast rounds out the twentieth century with whatever music passes his stringent Generation X authenticity test . <p> " So they 're not going to spend the whole day attacking us . " I make an unsuccessful attempt to suppress a yawn . " That 's good , right ? " <p> " Good for everyone else . " Regina yanks on the silver chain dangling from her belt loop , rolling it over her fingers like rosary beads . " What about me ? " <p> " Maybe it was a one-time thing . " David holds up a printout . " Maybe the FCC already shut them down . " <p> Regina scowls at him . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The timing could be a coincidence , " I tell her . <p> " At exactly midnight on Halloween ? I do n't buy it . " <p> I glance at the clock on the mantel of the bricked-up fireplace next to me , then put my head down on my desk . I have to be back here to work in five hours . Franklin will no doubt want help soothing the tempers of angry advertisers . <p> David shows Regina the different applications FAN has filed for translators , explaining how this was the only one with a conflicting frequency ( ours ) and no data on the translator 's location . Something 's definitely fishy . <p> I rest my chin on my folded arms . " Have you heard of this Family Action Network ? " <p> David nods . " Religious talk format , some nighttime musical programming . Last year I heard they were going bankrupt , but the FCC 's records show them expanding . " <p> Regina sniffs . " Someone funneled them cash , and it sure as shit was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segue into the plinky piano notes of Tori Amos 's " Happy Phantom . " <p> I drag myself to my feet . " Whether the piracy was on purpose or not , it 's over . I 'm going home to bed . " My feet scuff the rough hardwood floor , because I 'm too tired to lift them . I take my jacket off the coat rack , which is currently the hand of a life-size cardboard Elvis . <p> The song cuts off . <p> " Like all of Satan 's deceptions , the lie of Halloween is subtle . " The radio preacher 's once raging voice is now soft and cajoling . " It 's easy to fool ourselves into believing it does n't hurt our children ... " <p> David , Regina , and I stare at each other . <p> The man continues and finally says , " God tells us in Deuteronomy ... " <p> " Oh , no . " I put a hand to my forehead . " Here comes the fire thing . " <p> " ' ... not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter pass through the fire , one who uses divination , one who practices witchcraft ... ' " <p> " How 'd you know he was going to say that ? " Regina asks me . <p> " I was bathed in that stuff the first sixteen years of my life . " <p> The man 's voice takes on an edge again . " ' For whoever does these things is detestable to the Lord . ' " I can almost hear his spittle splash the microphone . " There 's no arguing with the word of God , people . Are we making our children walk through the fire ? " <p> The phone rings . <p> " Studio line , " David says . <p> It goes silent , which means Shane answered it , no doubt hearing the bad news from a listener . We hurry downstairs , through the employee lounge , and through the hallway door next to the lighted on the air sign . <p> To my right is a corridor leading to the vampires ' apartment , blocked by a door that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio , which contains an array of equipment  --  turntables , tape decks , CD players  --  some of which dates as far back as the 1940s to maintain " cognitive comfort " for the older DJs . <p> It also contains one pissed-off vampire . <p> On the phone , Shane sees us and holds up a finger . He speaks into the receiver , his hand forming a fist on the table and his eyes narrowed to slits . <p> He punches a switch on his console , slams down the phone , and stalks over to yank open the door . <p> " What the fuck 's going on ? " he asks us . " I thought it stopped after Regina 's show . " <p> " Now you know how it feels , " she says , suddenly calm and smug . <p> " I do n't get it . " David rubs the scar on the left side of his neck , which tells me his stress is building to a new level . " Why would they stop for exactly one song ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shane talking Regina out of violent solutions  --  while my mind drifts off , listening to the lilting tune and wondering what it has in common with Regina 's music . <p> Shane 's gaze flicks to the console , his DJ 's sixth sense kicking in near the end of a song . He moves back to the CD player just as a flash of insight hits me . <p> " Wait ! " I scramble into the studio . " What 's your next song ? " <p> " Kate Bush 's ' Under Ice . ' " He sits and adjusts the microphone . " Why ? " <p> " Switch the order and play the next track with a male singer . " <p> With no time to question , he hurries to reprogram the CD player . The song fades , and he hits a switch . " 94.3 WVMP-FM . Coming up on ten after three in the morning . I 'm feeling a little lonely on my favorite holiday , so phone in and say hey .

The synthesized New Wave riffs make my heel tap against the floor , long after I thought I had the energy . <p> The phone is dead quiet . <p> David turns to me . " I did n't authorize Ministry tickets . " <p> " That 's not the point . Shane wanted to see if our listeners could hear him . " The phone does n't ring , no matter how long we stare at it . " Which they could n't . " <p> Shane reaches for the transmitter console . " Let 's see if your theory worked . " <p> He flips a switch to receive our FM signal , so we can listen to what the world is hearing on our broadcast . <p> "  --  telling you , this culture war will be fought on the streets of our neighborhoods and  --  " <p> I frown at the sound of the evangelist 's voice .

" I know from working at stations where they make you talk over the music . " <p> " What 's your point ? " Regina says . <p> " There 's no singing yet , " Shane says , " so our pirates would n't know it 's a man and not a woman playing unless they recognized the song . " <p> Regina snickers . " And what are the chances of that ? " <p> We wait for the fifty-eight-second mark , for the vocalist to display his gender . When he starts singing , Shane gives it an extra half minute , then flips the transmitter back to the FM broadcast . <p> It 's " Everyday Is Halloween . " <p> " Whoa , " Regina breathes . " Fucking pirates left us alone once they heard a man singing . " <p> " But why ? " David asks . <p> " Ciara was right . " Shane swivels his chair to look at me .

I should at least make sure it 's not the Smoking Pig burning down . <p> My steps slow . Uh-oh . <p> It is the Smoking Pig burning down . <p> The bottom floor of the building is engulfed in roaring , licking flames . Clay-colored smoke billows from the front window .

" I was just telling him , I was in the office doing payroll when all of a sudden I hear car brakes squealing on the street . " He puts an oxygen mask to his face and takes a few breaths . " Then there 's glass breaking in the bar , like the window shattered . Then an explosion , but not like a grenade . I go out there and the whole place is in flames .
