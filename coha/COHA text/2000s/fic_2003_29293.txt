Chapter One You never saw it all . No matter how many times you walked through the blood and the gore , no matter how often you looked at the horror man inflicted on man , you never saw it all . There was always something worse , something meaner , or crazier , more vicious , more cruel . As Lieutenant Eve Dallas stood over what had once been a woman , she wondered when she would see worse than this . Two of the uniform cops on scene were still retching at the mouth of the alley . The sound of their sickness echoed back to her . She stood where she was , hands and boots already sealed , and waited for her own shuddering stomach to settle . Had she seen this much blood before ? It was hard to remember . It was best not to . She crouched , opened her field kit , and took out her ID pad to run the victim 's fingerprints . She could n't avoid the blood , so she stopped thinking about it . Lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad . " Victim is female , Caucasian . The body was discovered at approximately oh three-thirty by officers responding to anonymous nine-one-one , and is herewith identified through fingerprint check as Wooton , Jacie , age forty-one , licensed companion , residing 375 Doyers . " She took a shallow breath , then another . " Victim 's throat has been cut . Spatter pattern indicates wound was inflicted while victim stood against the north-facing wall of the alley . Blood pattern and trail would indicate victimfell or was laid across alley floor by assailant or assailants who then ... " Jesus . Oh Jesus . " Who then mutilated the victim by removing the pelvic area . Both the throat and pelvic wounds indicate the use of a sharp implement and some precision . " Despite the heat her skin prickled , cold and clammy as she took out gauges , recorded data . " I 'm sorry . " Peabody , her aide , spoke from behind her . Eve did n't have to look around to know Peabody 's face would still be pale and glossy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I could n't maintain . " " Do n't worry about it . You okay now ? " " I ... Yes , sir . " Eve nodded and continued to work . Stalwart , steady , and as dependable as the tide , Peabody had taken one look at what lay in the alley , turned sheet-white , and stumbled back toward the street at Eve 's sharp order to puke elsewhere . " I 've got an ID on her . Jacie Wooton , Doyers . An LC . Do a run for me . " " I 've never seen anything like this . Just never seen ... " " Get the data . Do it down there . You 're in my light here . " She was n't , Peabody knew . Her lieutenant was cutting her a break , and because her head wanted to spin again , she took it , moving toward the mouth of the alley . She 'd sweated through her uniform shirt , and her dark bowl of hair was damp at the temples under her cap . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated the run . And watched Eve work . Efficient , thorough , and some would say cold . But Peabody had seen the leap of shock and horror , and of pity on Eve 's face before her own vision had blurred . Cold was n't the word , but driven was . She was pale now , Peabody noted , and it was n't just the work lights that bleached the color from her narrow face . Her brown eyes were focused and flat , and unwavering as they examined the atrocity . Her hands were steady , and her boots smeared with blood . There was a line of sweat down the middle of the back of her shirt , but she would n't stumble away . She would stay until it was done . When Eve straightened , Peabody saw a tall , lean woman in stained boots , worn jeans , and a gorgeous linen jacket , a fine-boned face with a wide mouth , wide eyes of gilded brown , and a short and disordered cap of hair nearly the same color . More : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dallas- " " Peabody , I do n't care if you puke as long as you do n't contaminate the scene . Give me the data . " " Victim 's lived in New York for twenty-two years . Previous residence on Central Park West . She 's resided down here for eighteen months . " " That 's quite a change of venue . What she get popped for ? " " Illegals . Three strikes . Lost her top-drawer license , did six months in , rehab , counseling , and was given a probationary street license about a year ago . " " She roll on her dealer ? " " No , sir . " " We 'll see what the tox screen tells us once she 's in the morgue , but I do n't think Jack here is her dealer . " Eve lifted the envelope that had been left-sealed to prevent bloodstains-on the body . LIEUTENANT EVE DALLAS , NYPSD Computer-generated , she guessed , in a fancy font on elegant cream-colored paper . Thick , weighty , and expensive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , she mused , as her husband was big on sending and receiving high-class invites . She took out the second evidence bag and read the note again . Hello , Lieutenant Dallas : Hot enough for ya ? I know you 've had a busy summer , and I 've been admiring your work . I can think of no one on the police force of our fair city I 'd rather have join me on what I hope will be a very intimate level . Here is a sample of my work . What do you think ? Looking forward to our continued association . - Jack " I 'll tell you what I think , Jack . I think you 're a very sick fuck . Tag and bag , " she ordered with a last glance down the alley . " Homicide . " Wooton 's apartment was on the fourth floor of one of the housing structures thrown up as a temporary shelter for refugees and victims of the Urban Wars . A number of them stood in the poorer sections of the city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth between tossing out the low-rent LC 's , chemi-heads , and dealers along with the working poor and mowing down the shaky structures or revitalizing . While they dickered , the buildings decayed and nothing was done . Eve expected nothing would be done until the dumps collapsed inward on their residents and the city fathers found themselves in the throes of a class-action suit . But until that time , it was the sort of place you expected to find a down-on-her-luck whore . Her room was a hot little box with a stingy bump-out for a kitchen and a thin sliver for a bathroom . Her view was the wall of the identical building to the west . Through the thin walls Eve could clearly hear the heroic snoring from the apartment next door . Despite the circumstance , Jacie had kept her place clean , and had made some attempt at style . The furniture was cheap , but it was colorful . She had n't been able to afford privacy screens , but there were frilly curtains at the windows . She 'd left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made , and the sheets were good cotton . Possibly salvaged from better times , Eve thought . She had a low-end desk ' link on a table , and a prefab dresser covered with the various tools of her trade : enhancements , scents , wigs , tawdry jewelry , temporary tattoos . The drawer and closet held work clothes primarily , but mixed in with the whore-wear were a couple of more conservative outfits Eve imagined she 'd used for off-hours . She found a supply of over-the-counter meds , including a half bottle of Sober-Up and a full , unopened bottle as backup . Which made sense with the two bottles of vodka and the bottle of home-brew in the kitchen . She turned up no illegals , which caused her to assume Jacie had switched from chemicals to alcohol . She opened the desk ' link and replayed the transmissions received and sent over the last three days . One to her counselor to request an upgrade in her license , one received and not answered or yet returned from the landlord regarding overdue rent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No chats with pals , Eve mused . She scrolled through , located the financials , and found Jacie 's bookkeeping spare and efficient . Paid attention to her money , Eve mused , did the job , banked the pay , and pumped most of it back into the business . Expenses were high for wardrobe , body treatments , hair and face work . Used to looking good , Eve decided . Wanted to keep looking good . Self-esteem wrapped around appearance , which was wrapped around sexual appeal , which was wrapped around selling yourself for enough money to maintain appearance . A strange and sad cycle , in her opinion . " She made a nice nest for herself in a very ugly tree , " Eve commented . " I 've got no transmissions or any correspondence from anyone named Jack , or any one guy in particular for that matter . No marriage or cohabitation on record ? " " No , sir . " " We 'll talk to her counselor , see if there 's anybody she was close to , or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find him there . " " Dallas , it seems to me , what he did to her ... it seems to me that it was personal . " " Does , does n't it ? " She turned around , looked at the room again . Neat , girlie , with a desperate attempt at style . " I think it was very personal , but not specific to the victim . He killed a woman , and a woman who made her living from selling her body . That 's the personal part . You not only kill her , but you hack out the part of her that made that living . It 's not hard to find a street LC in this area any time of the night . You just have to choose your time and place . A sample of his work , " she murmured . " That 's all she was . " She walked to the window and , narrowing her eyes , visualized the street , the alley , the building just out of view . " He might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible it was chance . But he was ready if chance presented itself . He had the weapon , he had the note written and sealed , and something-a case , a bag , a satchel , something to carry fresh clothes , or to store whatever he was wearing . He 'd have been covered with her blood . " She goes in the alley with him , " Eve continued . " It 's hot , it 's late , business ca n't be very good . But here 's a job , maybe one last job before she heads home . She 's experienced , been in the life for two decades , but she does n't make him as trouble . Maybe she 's been drinking , or maybe he looked okay . And there 's the fact that she 's not used to street work , would n't have the instincts for it . " Too accustomed to the high life , Eve thought , to the sexual kinks of the wealthy and discreet . Coming down to Chinatown must 've been like landing on Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eve could see it , see it perfectly . The dark , spiked hair shimmering with silver , the come-on-big-boy red of the halter . " And she 's thinking she needs the fee to make the rent , or she hopes he hurries because her feet hurt-Jesus , they had to be killing her in those shoes . She 's tired , but she 'll take one more mark before she calls it a night . " When he slashes her throat , she 's surprised more than anything . It had to be quick and clean . One quick slice , left to right , straight across the jugular . Sprayed blood like a son of a bitch . Her body 's dead before her brain computes it . But that 's only the beginning for him . " She turned back , scanned the dresser . Cheap jewelry , expensive lip dye . Perfumes , designer knockoffs , to remind you that you 'd been able to bathe in the real thing once , and damn well would again . " He arranges her , lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had to have a bag somewhere to put what he 's taken from her . He cleans his hands . " She could see him , too , the shadow of him crouched in the filthy alley , hands slick with blood as he tidied up . " I bet he cleaned his tools , too , but he certainly cleans his hands . Takes the note he 's written , sets it neatly on her breasts . He had to change his shirt , or put a jacket on . Something , because of the blood . What then ? " Peabody blinked . " Ah , walks away , figuring job well done . He goes home . " " How ? " " Um , walks if he lives close enough . " She took a breath , pushing herself out of the alley and into her lieutenant 's mind . Into the killer 's mind . " He 's on top of the world , so he 's not worried about being hassled by a mugger . If he does n't live close by , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or covering up , there 's too much blood on him , and there 'd be a smell . It 'd be a stupid risk to take a cab or the subway . " " Good . We 'll check the cab companies for pickups around the crime scene during our time frame , but I do n't think we 'll find anything . Let 's seal this place up , canvass the building . " Neighbors , as was expected from neighbors in such places , knew nothing , heard nothing , saw nothing . The landlord operated out of a storefront in Chinatown , between a market that was running a special on ducks ' feet and an alternative medicine joint that promised health , well-being , and spiritual balance or your money back . Eve recognized Piers Chan 's type , the beefy arms in shirtsleeves , the pencil mustache over thin lips . The humble surroundings and diamond pinky ring . He was mixed-race , with enough Asian to have him set up in the business bustle of Chinatown , though she imagined his last ancestor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boxer Rebellion . Just as she imagined Chan kept his home and family in some upscale suburb in New Jersey while he played slumlord of the Lower East Side . " Wooton , Wooton . " While two silent clerks busied themselves in the back , Chan flipped through his tenant book . " Yes , she 's got a deluxe single on Doyers . " " Deluxe ? " Eve repeated . " And what makes it deluxe ? " " Got a kitchen area with built-in friggie and AutoChef . Comes with the package . She 's behind . Rent was due a week ago . She got the standard reminder call a couple days ago . She 'll get another today , then an automatic evict notice next week . " " That wo n't be necessary as she 's changed her address to the city morgue . She was murdered early this morning . " " Murdered . " His eyebrows lowered into an expression Eve interpreted as irritation rather than sympathy or shock . " Goddamn it . You seal the place ? " Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Look , I own six buildings , got seventy-two units . You got that many tenants , some of them are going to croak one way or another . You get your unattended death , your suspicious death , your misadventure , and your self-termination . " He ticked them off on his fat fingers . " And your homicide . " For that he used his thumb . " Then you guys come along , seal the place up , notify next of kin . Before I can blink some uncle or other is clearing the place out before I can put in a claim and get my back rent . " He spread his hands now , and sent Eve an aggrieved look . " I 'm just trying to make a living here . " " So was she , when somebody decided to carve her up . " He puffed out his cheeks . " Person 's in that kind of work , they 're going to take some lumps . " " You know , this outpouring of humanitarianism is choking me up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Jacie Wooton ? " " I knew her application , her references , and her rent payment . Never set eyes on her myself . I do n't have time to make friends with the tenants . I 've got too many . " " Uh-huh . Continues ...
