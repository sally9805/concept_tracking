<p> The line starts forming at 1:30 p.m. , a good hour before students are dismissed . By the time the final bell rings at Cherokee County 's Liberty Elementary School , as many as 500 cars will be idling in place . <p> They block the fire lane beside the school and spill out onto busy Bells Ferry Road , forcing other drivers to maneuver around them . <p> Most of the parents , and occasionally grandparents , are waiting to pick up a single child . <p> The twice-daily traffic jam makes no sense to Cheryl Rohn , who walks about two miles a day , chaperoning her daughter to and from school . " I ca n't deal with this traffic , " she said , motioning to the line of sport utility vehicles , minivans and cars . <p> Neither can many principals , who are frustrated with congestion around schools . As another school year begins Monday in most of the large metro Atlanta counties , many school leaders are trying harder to persuade parents to give the school bus a try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an alternative to waiting in line for hours , not to mention burning gas at $3 a gallon . They 're citing the safety records of school buses  --  which are far less likely to have a crash than the family car . <p> Sometimes they 'll point out the obvious  --  tax dollars are paying for buses with empty seats . <p> The state provides money for transportation for students who live farther away than 1.5 miles , and many districts put in enough local money to extend the service to all students . <p> There is no financial incentive for systems to beef up ridership . In fact , they will likely spend more money on buses , salaries and fuel if more students ride . But school officials say they want more kids on the buses because it is the safer , healthier option . <p> Gene Thomason , director of transportation for the Cherokee schools , emphasized traffic safety , in addition to the reduced air pollution and traffic congestion . " Riding the bus is a lot safer . Eighty-seven times more safe than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safety Council . <p> The bus is more efficient for schools , too , said Tony Pickett , an administrator with the Henry County system . " The more students you have riding the bus , the fewer staff members you have to assign to getting students in and out of cars , safely , " he said . <p> In several metro systems , transportation officials estimate about 62 percent to 78 percent of students ride buses . That percentage has remained fairly constant over the years , they say . And it is better than the national average , which hovers around 54 percent . <p> But tens of thousands of parents here are doing the driving themselves . <p> In Cherokee County , for example , which started school Aug. 1 , about 12,000 students are being driven by parents , or , in the case of older students , driving themselves . <p> To promote the bus as an option , some area schools have enlisted the help of environmental organizations , such as the Clean Air Campaign , which doles out small treats to kids who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders . <p> Fliers sent home with children emphasize the environmental benefits of buses , including cleaner air and less gas consumption . <p> At Lewis Elementary School in Cobb County , there 's a sign : " No idling . Little lungs at work . " <p> The school has partnered with the Clean Air Campaign for several years , promoting the bus as the environmental choice . Other schools that will take part this year include Manning Oaks and Ocee elementary schools in north Fulton County . <p> " We want to teach the children how to take care of the Earth and the air , " said Alexis Hartsfield , a kindergarten teacher at Lewis , who coordinates its program . " We talk about traffic and the safety concerns . We just try to encourage them that way . " <p> But , to the parents who line up every day outside schools , the decision comes down to personal choice . <p> Many say they are unlikely to change their habit , unless a change in jobs takes away their flexibility to get to the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety on a school bus . <p> They cite the lack of seat belts or air conditioning on buses and the presence of older and bigger students who could bully or harm their children . <p> Other parents cite the inefficiency of bus schedules . In the morning , children usually have to wake up earlier to catch a school bus . <p> It takes more time for children to get home on a bus . With children involved in activities , from piano lessons to math tutoring , parents say going to the school and fetching them makes more sense . <p> Some parents , such as Kim Laman , want quiet time to talk with their kids , away from the TV , friends and other distractions . <p> Every weekday morning , Laman drops off her 8-year-old son , David , at Liberty Elementary . Six hours later , she 's outside , waiting for him in the family car . <p> " I love him , and I want to see as much of him as I can , " she said last week . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 more minutes I do n't have with him . " <p> Three cars behind her sat Ray Crawford , a self-employed driver for a bread company . <p> He has time to drop off his son in the morning and pick him up in the afternoon . And he feels more secure , chauffeuring Noah himself . <p> He 's worried about older kids on the bus picking on his son  --  a kindergartner with a new Spider-Man book bag . By the end of the school year , Noah might be ready to ride the bus by himself . But not yet , Crawford said . " I worry because he 's 5 , and might forget where he 's going , might forget to get off . " <p> Of course , Noah has his own opinion . " He begs to ride the bus , " Crawford said . " Later on in the school year , I 'll have to let him ride . Otherwise , he 'll bug us to death . " <p> Liberty Elementary Principal Karen Hawley has heard all the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She understands that many parents are worried about safety , but she also thinks media attention tends to magnify the problems that occur on buses , from a forgotten kindergartner to a fistfight . Because so many buses now have cameras , the media have access to video of incidents when they happen . <p> " When something happens , it 's on the Internet immediately , and it 's in every news outlet , " Hawley said . " Parents are thinking it 's happening on every bus in the nation . And it 's not . " <p> At her school , seven minor incidents were reported last school year on buses , and there was one complaint of disorderly conduct and one accusation of sexual harassment , according to state Department of Education records . <p> Hawley is more concerned about another safety issue  --  parents blocking the fire lane outside her school . <p> Beyond encouraging parents to give the bus a chance , however , she 's limited in what she can do to dissuade parents from taking students to and from school . <p> Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap of faith . <p> Heather Mullinax has two sons at Liberty , in the fourth and fifth grades . Because she worked outside the home until last year , the boys rode the bus . She could drive them now , but the boys , now 9 and 10 , prefer the bus . <p> " They love riding the school bus , " Mullinax said . " It allows them to be independent .
