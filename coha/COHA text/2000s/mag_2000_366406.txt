Independent voters go for John McCain , so he may enjoy stretches of the road ahead . More than half the state primaries through March 14 allow independents to vote one way or another . <P> WIDE-OPEN PRIMARIES Georgia , Massachusetts , Missouri , Ohio , Rhode Island , Vermont ( 3/7 ) , Utah ( 3/10 ) , Mississippi , Tennessee , Texas ( 3/14 ) <P> ANALYSIS Voters in most of these states do n't register their party affiliation , and they can vote in whichever primary they want . Rhode Island and Massachusetts allow independents to vote for either party 's contender , then redeclare their indie status as they leave the polls . <P> SORT-OF-OPEN PRIMARIES South Carolina ( 2/19 ) , Michigan ( 2/22 ) , Virginia ( 2/29 ) , Maryland ( 3/7 ) <P> ANALYSIS South Carolina ( where a third of voters are indies ) , Michigan and Virginia allow anyone to vote in their G.O.P. primaries , while Democrats in these states opt to hold caucuses later for the party faithful . Nothing prevents Democrats from participating in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary . <P> CLOSED PRIMARIES Delaware ( 2/8 ) , Arizona ( 2/22 ) , Connecticut , Maine , New York ( 3/7 ) , Colorado ( 3/10 ) , Florida , Louisiana , Oklahoma ( 3/14 ) <P> ANALYSIS McCain 's decision to bypass Delaware could be wise . Its G.O.P. primary , like Arizona 's , is for Republicans only . Only three of the March 7 primaries are closed to independents , but George W. Bush can take comfort the week after . Half of the South 's contests that day are closed . Texas ' is not . <P> THE EXCEPTION California ( 3/7 ) <P> ANALYSIS Independent voters here might just as well throw their vote away . The primary is ostensibly open , but when it comes to awarding delegates , Democrats and Republicans alike plan to count only the votes of registered party members . The overall vote results are thus a nonbinding " beauty contest . " <P>  --  By Mitch Frank
