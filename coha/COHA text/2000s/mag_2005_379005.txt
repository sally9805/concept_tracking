The two giants could have ignored each other or become enemies . So how is it that Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass , the most famous black man of the 19th century , became friends ? And what difference did their friendship make ? <P> The answer is that Lincoln recognized early on that he needed the ex-slave to help him destroy the Confederacy and preserve the Union . And so at a time when most whites would not let a black man cross their threshold , the President met Douglass three times at the White House and found a startling way to enlist him in his cause . What was in it for Douglass , who at the midpoint of the Civil War came to believe that Lincoln was a racist who argued that blacks and whites should be kept apart ? Douglass came to realize that Lincoln 's shrewd sense of timing and public opinion would serve his goal of freeing the nation 's blacks . <P> Despite the immense racial gulf separating them , Lincoln and Douglass had a lot in common . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born dirt poor , had less than a year of formal schooling and became one of the nation 's greatest Presidents . Douglass spent the first 20 years of his life as a slave , had no formal schooling  --  in fact , his masters forbade him to read or write  --  and became one of the nation 's greatest writers and activists . Though nine years younger , Douglass overshadowed Lincoln as a public figure during the 15 years before the Civil War . He published two best-selling autobiographies before the age of 40 , edited his own newspaper beginning in 1847 and was a brilliant orator  --  even better than Lincoln  --  at a time when public speaking was a major source of entertainment and power . <P> Lincoln and Douglass also shared many common interests . They loved music and literature and educated themselves ( Douglass on the sly while a slave ) by reading the same books : Aesop 's Fables , the Bible , Shakespeare and especially The Columbian Orator , a popular anthology of speeches for boys . They were athletic , strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. 4 in. , when the average height for men was 5 ft. 7 in . They refrained from alcohol and tobacco at a time when many politicians " squirted their tobacco juice upon the carpet " and drank on the job . They were ambitious men and had great faith in the moral and technological progress of their nation . And they both called slavery a sin . " If slavery is not wrong , nothing is wrong , " Lincoln stated . " I can not remember when I did not so think , and feel . " For Douglass , slavery was not only a sin but " piracy and murder . " And both men explained their destiny by quoting the same lines from Shakespeare 's Hamlet : " There 's a divinity that shapes our ends , Rough-hew them how we will . " <P> It 's true that Douglass was a radical ; he demanded an immediate end to slavery , equal rights for all men and women , and the redistribution of land so that no one would be rich and no one poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " principles in the Declaration of Independence " and " prepare the earth for a millennium of righteousness and peace . " Lincoln was a moderate ; he concluded ( as did most Americans ) that the Constitution defended slavery in states where it already existed . But , like Douglass , he emphasized that the Declaration was the centerpiece of government . It was the " apple of gold " within the Constitution 's " picture of silver . "
