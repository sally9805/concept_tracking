What are memoirs , really , but an invitation to rubberneck at the multicar pileups in someone else 's life ? Rebecca Walker 's foray into the genre , Black , White and Jewish : Autobiography of a Shifting Self ( Riverhead Books ; 320 pages ; $23.95 ) , is plenty gapeworthy . Her book teems with childhood wreckage : premature sex , reckless drug experimentation , the end of her parents ' interracial marriage , and her own consistently tenuous relationships born of desperation . Interwoven are heartrending but barbed recollections of absent , distracted parents  --  a self-absorbed mother , writer Alice Walker , who hires someone to take her daughter clothes shopping because she is " too busy to do it ; too tired " ; and a " checked out , sagging " father , civil rights attorney Mel Leventhal . <P> Walker skillfully depicts her tangled upbringing , full of disappointment and privilege , but she fails to weight those memories with the resonance of close , insightful scrutiny . Perhaps that 's why there is no sustained consideration of race or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidental to the fallout from the ravages of a broken home . <P> As is true for others on the mainstream 's margins , being born biracial is an invitation to view the world from the wondrous , troubling perspective of insider/outsider . Walker , now 31 , employed her obvious intellect and political convictions several years ago in co-founding Third Wave , an activist organization for women ages 15 to 30 , but in this book she seems too enmeshed in the raw emotions of her early years to take advantage of her birthright . <P>  --  By Lise Funderburg
