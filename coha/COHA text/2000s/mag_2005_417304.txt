An illness-by-illness guide // Now that I 'm a mom , I often wish I owned one of those head-to-toe protective suits that scientists wear when working with super-germs . In the past five years , my husband and I have battled everything from coughs and colds to pinkeye and stomach bugs-all seeming to have originated with our sons , ages 5 and 3 . If your child 's in daycare or school , or you belong to a playgroup , there 's only so much you can do to protect him from catching whatever 's going around . And when he does catch it , you 're at a real disadvantage simply by being in direct , regular contact with him . But are you doomed to get sick ? Not necessarily . Keeping your immunity up in general puts you ahead of the game . Beyond that , taking steps to control the infection at the onset can actually up your odds of staying well ( and keeping the rest of your family healthy ) . What you can do to stave off some common kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in kids under 5 . It does n't pose a threat to grown-ups because most have had it by early childhood , so you 're not likely to get as severely ill as kids are . Two stomach bugs that can make adults sick are the Norwalk-like virus and giardiasis , a parasitic infection . Norwalk can produce low-grade fever , headache , vomiting , and diarrhea ; it 's found in uncooked foods , raw fruits and vegetables , and contaminated water . Daycare centers are common breeding grounds for the parasite that causes giardiasis . Symptoms include diarrhea and stomach cramps . Infection control Because giardiasis is highly contagious and can stay in the stool for several weeks after the diarrhea 's over , have your child wash her hands before every meal and make sure she does n't share cups , utensils , snacks , toys , etc . Self-defense Wash your hands thoroughly every time you change a diaper or help with a potty visit . Wipe potentially contaminated areas , including changing table , diaper bin , toilet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part bleach to ten parts water a few times a day . Toss soiled clothing or linens into the laundry right away ; regular detergent will do the trick . Colds and flu Before you became a mom , you might have sailed through the year with only an occasional cold . Now , any time your child has the sniffles , your own nose starts to run a few days later . Infection control The standard advice bears repeating : * Frequent hand-washing is crucial to keep germs of any kind from spreading . And regular soap is fine . The key to ridding hands of germs " is less about the soap and more about the friction you create by rubbing your hands back and forth for a good fifteen to twenty seconds , " says Susan Coffin , M.D. , medical director of infection prevention and control at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia . * Do n't let sick kids share cups , utensils , or snacks . With very bad colds and with the flu , try to limit close contact between sick kids and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the baby he loves her , but hugs and kisses are out for a while . Separate baths are a good idea too , and it ca n't hurt to wipe down frequently-played-with toys with a sanitizing wipe at the end of the day . * Teach your child to cough or sneeze into his elbow and to use a tissue to wipe his nose . Dirty tissues should be tossed immediately . Self-defense When a child brings home a cold , back up when he coughs or sneezes : Viruses ca n't travel beyond about three feet , says Dr. Coffin . Your child 's feelings wo n't be hurt if you explain why you 're keeping your distance . Beyond that , a good offense-a strong immune system-is the best defense against colds and flu . To boost yours : * Get enough sleep ( at least seven or eight hours a night ; if you 're the mom of a baby or toddler , try to make up for lost shut-eye with naps ) . * Eat five-plus servings of fruits and vegetables a day-especially those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries , and grapefruit , and easy-to-tote juices and dried fruits . * Practice stress-relieving activities , like meditation , or even taking a walk or a hot-tea break . * If you feel a cold coming on , eat more immunity-boosting food : Doing so wo n't stop the cold but may shorten its duration . " The minute one of my girls has a sign of a cold , I make soups with garlic , kale , and onions , " says Montclair , New Jersey , mom Stephanie Finucane , whose kids are 4 and 2 . " Kale has vitamin C , and garlic 's good for the immune system , but I just tell them that the soup will make them feel better faster . " Coxsackie virus ( a.k.a. hand , foot , and mouth disease ) While it tends to hit most often in summer and early fall , at first symptoms of this disease resemble a garden-variety cold : fatigue , sore throat , and fever . After a day or two , fluid-filled sores will start to develop on the hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases on the buttocks . These should crust over after five to seven days . Infection control The Coxsackie virus is transmitted through saliva , mucus , and stool , so make sure your child practices sensible hygiene , including regular hand-washing and no sharing of cups or utensils-and toss favorite toys in the dishwasher or washer for a nightly cleaning . Self-defense Your child 's contagious as long as she 's got sores and possibly for several weeks beyond , as the virus may linger in feces . Be diligent about hand-washing , especially after diaper changes or helping out at the potty . Hand-sanitizing gels and alcohol-based wipes will do . Chicken pox The varicella vaccine ( recommended for all kids under 12 ) has brought about a significant drop in the number of hospitalizations and deaths from chicken pox . But even if your child gets the shot , it 's not a guarantee he wo n't get the disease : One in five vaccinated kids will develop what 's known as " breakthrough illness " when exposed to the virus . Even though this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's still contagious . If you 're not immune ( you 've never had chicken pox nor a vaccination against it ) , you could come down with a more severe case . In general , chicken pox poses a bigger threat to adults than to kids ; grown-ups are more likely to be hospitalized or die of complications , including pneumonia or infection of the brain . Infection control Until your child has n't developed any new lesions for 24 hours and all of her existing blisters have crusted over , she 's considered contagious . Make sure she washes her hands often and that she does n't share any drinking glasses or utensils ; see that she throws away used tissues promptly . Do n't let her sleep in the same room with someone who 's not immune . Self-defense If you 're not sure whether you 've had chicken pox , but you know you 've been exposed , get vaccinated right away . " If you do it within seventy-two hours , you have a decent chance of not getting sick . Within twenty-four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until then , minimize the amount of " air space " ( infection-control lingo ) you and your child share . Not only are her blisters contagious but so 's her saliva . By simply talking , your child is contaminating the air . ( If 100 nonimmune people were to simply walk through her bedroom , 90 of them would get sick. ) * Eating , playing , and snuggling with a sick kid puts you at risk until you 're vaccinated ( another reason to get that shot right away ! ) . Put someone who 's definitely immune in charge of such close-contact childcare duties as diaper changes , baths , and giving medicine . * Keeping your distance is crucial if you 're expecting . The vaccine is n't recommended during pregnancy , and your unborn baby is at risk of birth defects if exposed to the virus in utero . ( The vaccine 's fine if you 're nursing . If you 're thinking of getting pregnant , it 's a good idea to have a blood test to determine whether you 're immune to chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) * If getting childcare help is n't an option , wash your hands after every intimate encounter with your child . If you get chicken pox anyway , an antiviral medication such as acyclovir can shorten the course of the illness . Strep throat In older kids and grown-ups , strep causes a super-sore throat and swollen glands ; infants and toddlers tend to get less sick , but symptoms-bloody nasal discharge , reduced appetite , and swollen glands-can still make them uncomfortable . Infection control Once strep infects one child , everyone else in the family is an easy target . And strep can reinfect the same victim . Margaret Moxley , a mom of three boys in Nashville , learned that lesson the first time strep hit her family . " Right around the time the first kid to get sick was finishing his antibiotics , boy number two came down with it and in turn exposed the third child . Then boy number one got exposed again , and so forth . " After 24 to 48 hours on oral antibiotics , a child is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing towels , cups , and toys apply . If your child 's on an antibiotic , make sure he takes it at regular intervals and that he finishes all of the medication . If not treated properly , strep can spread to other areas of the body and can lead to ear and sinus infections , or even rheumatic fever . Self-defense For grown-ups , strep is n't as easily transmittable as , say , a cold , but it 's most contagious before symptoms appear . During the three weeks that strep was cycling through her house , Moxley managed to stay well " by washing my hands till they bled and changing my clothes every time someone vomited in my vicinity . " But despite all her precautions , the infection still snuck by her : Just as the family was leaving to visit her husband 's family , her throat started to feel scratchy . " Three hours into the trip , I felt like my head was going to explode and my throat was on fire . My husband , who 'd somehow escaped getting sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' house ; my mother took me right to her doctor , who diagnosed strep ! " So take the basic steps to prevent infection : Wash your hands frequently , especially after close contact with your child , even if he does n't seem sick ; if strep 's going around , you 're most likely to get infected before symptoms show up . If possible , avoid close , intimate contact with a sick kid until the antibiotics have kicked in . Pinkeye ( a.k.a. conjunctivitis ) There 's no mistaking the telltale pinkish hue caused by conjunctivitis , a bacterial or viral infection of the inside of the eye . The infected eye ( or eyes ) might itch and ooze , which is why a yellowish crust often develops during sleep . But it is tough to distinguish between a bacterial infection ( which will respond to antibiotics ) and a viral one ( which wo n't , but usually runs its course in seven to ten days ) . " If an eye is really red or pink , and there 's a thick , yellowish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go ahead and prescribe antibiotic drops . Usually the eye will clear up in three to five days , " says Emmanuel Walter , M.D. , associate professor of pediatrics at Duke University Medical Center . In some cases , an antibiotic ointment or oral antibiotics may be prescribed . Infection control Make sure you : * Keep your child from touching her face . Give her her own set of towels ( and a separate washcloth just for her infected eye ; holding a cool or warm cloth over an itchy or irritated eye can help it feel better ) , and change them each day . Be aware that any secretions from her nose or mouth will likely contain the offending germs , so remind her to cough or sneeze into her elbow . * Put a ban on sharing drinks , food , or utensils , and limit close contact between siblings-no kissing , roughhousing , bathing , or napping together . See that your child washes her hands with soap and warm water before eating . * Wipe off toys that are visibly soiled or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warm water until the eye clears up . You can also put dirty playthings in the dishwasher or washing machine . * Keep bedding clean , too . " When pinkeye made the rounds in my home , it meant my older kids missed days of school and I missed days of work , " says JulieAnna Anastassatos , a mom of four in Reno , Nevada . " I tried to get by with changing the kids ' sheets every other day , but when I realized that we were going on three weeks where at least three of the five of us had pinkeye , I started changing at least the pillowcases every day . If I 'd been more vigilant from the get-go , it might have shortened the course of the pinkeye . " Self-defense If you put drops in your child 's eyes , wash your hands thoroughly afterward .
