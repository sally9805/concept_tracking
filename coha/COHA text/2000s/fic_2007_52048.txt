" I 'M LATE FOR WORK , " SAID Laura . " Look at this one . " Tony pointed to a spot on his cheek . " Oh , no ! I do n't have time for this . " His wife attempted to get out the door , but Tony stopped her . He turned to get a better view in the mirror . This was difficult in the light of a twenty-five-watt bulb , but Tony was accustomed to dim light . The heavy curtains in the apartment were drawn and the blinds were down . An air purifier in a comer sucked up germs , pollen , and dust mites . " It 's a freckle , " Laura said . " No , it is n't , " said Tony , annoyed by her lack of sympathy . " That 's a classic irregular , pigmented lesion , number 4A . " He pointed at the mole chart hanging next to the mirror . " Wow . Spectacular . Listen , I 'll be late tonight . Could you pick up a pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air followed her out the door . The apartment was equipped with a positive air pressure system , like the ones in top secret government labs , to repel West Nile virus , anthrax , bird flu , and Ebola . Tony studied mole number 4A . He knew it was plotting to kill him . It was one of the bad ones that would turn into cancer the minute it got a shot of cigarette smoke . Actually , they were all bad ones , like gang members waiting on the street corner for the nerd to come out . Tony could n't open a magazine without reading about something lethal - radon in the basement , mad cow disease , cosmic rays tearing through bone marrow . When he was little he 'd chewed on a crib covered in white lead paint . ( Thanks , Mom . ) He 'd gone to a school with asbestos in the walls . But nothing worried him as much as the moles . Red , mouse-brown , charcoal , and black , they covered Tony 's body . Everyone said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like freckles when doctors examined them . The rest of the time they lounged insultingly on his skin , waiting for him to make a mistake . Give us sunlight , baby , they crooned , some of that sweet , sweet ultraviolet . Tony dressed slowly , sipping a bottle of triple-distilled water . He wore a long-sleeved shirt with air vents in the arm pits that looked like little screen doors . He put on a wide-brimmed hat , dark glasses , and an air filter over his nose that made him look - Laura said - like a human fly . He covered his hands with the kind of sunblock astronauts wore in outer space . It was a beautiful spring day outside . A haze of fungus spores floated past the air filter , hoping to gain access to his lungs and grow like kudzu vines . Tony sat on the shady side of the train . The seats farthest from him filled up first and then , like antelopes being herded toward a pond they know contains a crocodile , the latecomers edged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a health magazine about a boy who was paralyzed from the neck down by a tick bite . There was a law against smoking in offices , but Tony 's boss paid no attention to it . None of the worker bees was going to turn him in . " Fine day , " he said , blowing smoke over the mole on Tony 's cheek . Tony felt the mole tingle in response . " Dark in here , is n't it ? " His boss lifted the blind and sunlight poured in , bathing Tony 's back with sweet , sweet ultraviolet . Tony sat quite still . He heard a tiny cheer . The moles had the ball and were headed for a touchdown . The fans went wild . The star player , a muscular melanoma , was cutting down the opposition like a scythe . Tony let the blind down with a crash . " You know , " said his boss , " I 've been worried about you . You sit in here all day muffled up like the Invisible Man . You never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you heart trouble , " said Tony . " Look , I 've been talking to Laura . We both think you need a vacation . " " Are you firing me ? " Tony asked . " No , no . I 'm doing you a favor . Go out and play . Take Laura to the beach . Soak up a little UV . " Tony looked at him as though he were crazy . " That 's an order , " said his boss . " One month minimum . Oh , and when you come back , lose the air filter . " Tony knew they were talking about him in the office as he gathered up his stuff . He decided to walk home , not caring where he went so long as there was enough shade . Trucks exhaled diesel around him . A man with a leaf blower chased a cloud of pollutants down a walk . But after a while he found himself in a quiet , tree-covered neighborhood . The shade was deep and satisfying , and the walls covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bronze oval , almost hidden in leaves , said Dr. Molnar 's Mole Cure . Mole cure . Tony had never heard of such a thing . He tiptoed to a window draped with dark velvet curtains and peered through a gap . He saw heavy , antique furniture . There were walls lined with bookshelves and a ladder to reach the upper levels . A small table held a flowered teapot and cups . It was like something from an old movie , and Tony liked it in spite of the dust mites and allergens that probably lived there . He rang the bell and the door flew open as though the man on the other side had been waiting for him . " Naughty boy ! I saw you peeking , " cried Dr. Molnar . He was small , with glistening black eyes and black hair that lay flat against his scalp as though painted on . " I - uh , I read your sign , " said Tony . " It 's kind of small , if you want to attract business . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly ... the right size . " Dr. Molnar paused for emphasis . " Too large and you attract the wrong sort . My sign is only visible to the truly needy . " " Truly needy ? " echoed Tony , wondering who the wrong sort was . " I have seen people in the throes of divorce , who have lost jobs , who are contemplating suicide . They come to me , imploring me on bended knee to remove the parasites that have sucked the joy out of their existence . Those parasites . " The little man waved his hand at a chart that Tony recognized as the same one that decorated his wall . Only this chart was much larger . Mole number 4A lounged in the middle like the centerfold for Mole Monthly . " The procedure is painless , of course , " continued the doctor . " This way , please . I need to examine you . " Tony was accustomed to doctors trying to evict him from their offices and so he was flattered , if alarmed , to see Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Such variety ! " the little man cried , dancing around . " I have rarely seen such a marvelous collection . We must begin at once . " " Wait a minute ! " Tony backed away . " I need to think about this . " " Let me show you something , " said Doctor Molnar , propelling him back to the elegant study and whisking a heavy silk cover from an object in a corner . It was a mirror . The oval frame was wreathed in serpents that twined about one another with the occasional flash of a jeweled eye . The glass itself was backed with gold , not silver like an ordinary mirror , and Tony 's reflection was darker . He caught his breath . By some trick of light the moles had vanished ! His skin was perfect , as he had only imagined it in dreams . " You see ? " the little man said . " I got that mirror from a Transylvanian gypsy . He said it was used to detect vampires , but I discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moles do n't go to heaven , " said Tony , obscurely pleased by the idea . " That could be you , " Dr. Molnar said , resting his soft little hand on Tony 's shoulder , " free of the invading army that has dominated you so long . You see , moles are n't what people think . They do n't merely sit around like bumps on a log . They insinuate themselves into every activity and make you behave in a way that is beneficial to them , not you . First and foremost , they do not allow you to take risks , for that might damage their comfortable existence . Mole hosts live in an atmosphere of fear . " " Mole hosts ? " murmured Tony , finding himself ensconced in an extremely comfortable armchair . He had no memory of sitting down . " You fear pizza because the salt might raise your blood pressure . Coffee might give you heart palpitations . Do n't go into the basement it 's full of radon . Do n't go outside . Jet planes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist to make you passive and safe . " " Cat dander , rogue golf balls , runaway shopping carts , " Tony said , mentioning three of his favorite phobias . " The ideal host for a colony of moles is a couch potato watching TV shows about global warming . But we 're going to fix that . " Dr. Molnar poured Tony a cup of tea . It was excellent , flavored with an unfamiliar spice . A sense of well-being swept through Tony 's body , and his skin tingled pleasantly . A tape recorder clicked on nearby . How nice . Music , he thought . Tony drifted asleep as Billie Holliday sang the blues . HE WOKE UP in the armchair . Darkness had fallen and he heard something large being moved on squeaky wheels in the next room . The doctor popped through the door like a squirrel that has just deposited a large cache of nuts . " Perfect ! You 're awake on schedule . I find a slice of Sacher torte restores one 's spirits enormously . " Dr. Molnar cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tony ate ravenously , licking the chocolate from his fingers , something he never , ever did . Think of the carbohydrates ! The trans-fats ! He had n't even disinfected his hands ! Tony studied his arm in the mellow light of the library . " They 're gone , " he said wonderingly . " Not many , but some . " Here and there , among the brown , red and charcoal moles , were tiny pucker marks . " I only take one type at a time , " the doctor explained . " Today I removed the slate blues . " " There 's a difference ? " Tony asked . " Good heavens , yes . Moles are as various as dogs . You would n't expect a chihuahua to behave like a chow . " Something about the way Dr. Molnar spoke raised distant alarm bells in Tony 's mind . He imagined the little man calling moles like a pack of hounds : Here , Blue ! Come here , Blue ! Good boy ! But the fee the doctor charged was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctor paid for the taxi to take him home . That night , Tony and Laura celebrated with a candlelight dinner . Because he had already abused his body with a carb overload , Tony agreed to have a sip of Laura 's champagne . He found it delicious and did n't even get heartburn later . " What drug are you giving me ? " Tony was back in the armchair , cradling the cup of tea . It was his fifth treatment and the slate blues had been followed by the smoky topazes , the hairy browns , and port wines . The earliest pucker marks were filling in . Not only that , but several phobias had vanished . One of them , the belief that a black widow spider had spun a web under the toilet seat , had been with him since childhood . Until now , Tony had not felt bold enough to ask questions and Doctor Molnar had not volunteered any answers . But today was different . Tony had gone back to work . His new confidence had allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coffee break , although he brought his own bottle of triple-distilled water . No matter . His boss and fellow workers had welcomed him just the same . " Actually , I use two drugs , " said Dr. Molnar . " One is a tranquilizer and the other is my personal discovery . My Ph.D . thesis was on slime molds . The slime mold is a single-celled creature dwelling in water throughout most of its existence . It lives like a hermit until it has used up the food in its neighborhood . Then , " the little man 's eyes glistened and for the first time Tony noticed how velvety they seemed , " it wants company . Naturally , being a mere speck , it can not shout . Instead , it sends out a chemical message , a pheromone that says , yoo hoo , I am lonely . " The way Dr. Molnar said yoooo hoooo was like a tiny wolf howl . " The specks come together in their thousands , " he went on . " They make a multi-celled being called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a driving purpose . Out of the Many comes the One . It is one of the great miracles of nature . " Dr. Molnar was so moved , he wiped his velvety eyes . Tony had a sudden urge to get up and flee , but he had already drunk half the tea . The familiar sleepiness was beginning to overwhelm him . " A slug is able to move great distances , but once it finds a new territory and food source , another miracle occurs , " the doctor explained . " The One becomes the Many again . The single cells wander off .. . to feed . " Dr. Molnar sat back , as pleased as a puppy that has just retrieved a tennis ball . Tony struggled to stay awake . " Thish pheromone works on moles ? " he slurred . " With a little help . It needs a trigger . " " Wha - what trigger ? " Tony said with a tongue that seemed to weigh a thousand pounds . " Music . " The doctor clicked on the tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony 's skin tingled in response . Some of it tingled . He closed his eyes and let the drug carry him away . The smooth purples were partial to Frank Sinatra , and when Tony awoke , all five of them had departed . That left only the bruise greens and speckled blacks . " I ca n't warm up to speckled blacks , " said Dr. Molnar , frowning . " I suppose it 's because I do n't like Country &; Western music . Speckled blacks wo n't respond to anything else and they always seem , I do n't know , like they 'd chew tobacco and spit . They 're essentially lowrent . " Tony 's mouth was crammed with Sacher torte . He could n't seem to help himself after a treatment . He wanted more and more sugar and fat , as though he were making up for years of privation . Then his brain fogged up from the sugar high and all too soon he was on his way home in a taxi . When he sobered up the next morning , Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve only lasted five days . He was so close . There were only eight speckled blacks and a baker 's dozen of bruise greens . With them gone he would be perfect . One thing he was certain of : No more tranquilizers . " I do n't think that 's a good idea , " said the doctor when Tony posed his conditions . " I 'd like to see what happens . " " The sight would be extremely disturbing . " " Exactly what happens when I 'm unconscious ? " insisted Tony . Instead of answering , the little man whisked the heavy , silk cover from the golden mirror . The serpents flashed their jeweled eyes and when Tony was n't looking directly at them , he heard a rustling and a dry flickering . He gazed at his darker self floating in a golden world , tranquil and perfect . And then he saw something he had n't noticed the first time . Dr. Molnar was standing beside him but he had no reflection in the mirror . " We are not all evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not appear in the glass . We are not all vampires . " Tony 's head was swimming . He felt the doctor 's soft , damp presence beside him . " What are you ? " he whispered . " Call me a shepherd , " said Dr. Molnar with an odd sort of dignity . " A shepherd of a rather unusual flock , but one that has been immensely kind to you . Remember how desperate you were when you first came here . " " I remember , " Tony said unwillingly , staring at his golden reflection . " I will treat you one more time , " the doctor decided , " on your terms . But I must take precautions . Which moles would you like me to remove ? " Tony chose the bruise greens because there were more of them . Dr. Molnar ran straps across Tony 's chest and legs , his wrists and ankles . Tony choked down a moment of panic . Of course there were no such things as vampires . Of course the doctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tea rested heavily on his tongue , but without tranquilizers his mind stayed clear . He heard a squeaking noise as something heavy was wheeled to the side of the armchair . He glimpsed an aquarium . Something clouded the bottom that might have been algae except that it flashed from side to side with breathtaking speed . " Past your feeding time , " remarked Dr. Molnar . He opened a styrof oam container and tipped the contents inside . The darkness flashed over . The hamburger steamed and bubbled . An oily stain spread over the water , accompanied by an acrid smell . Now Tony wanted to ask for the tranquilizer , but the thought of lying unconscious next to whatever-that-was stopped him cold . Dr. Molnar flicked on the tape recorder . The bruise-greens , it turned out , were fond of Wagner . As the Ride of the Valkyries filled the room , Tony felt stirrings under his skin . In ten or perhaps twelve places he felt a twitching like an ant struggling up through sand . He sensed answering thrums from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he felt pleasure , a startling and fierce joy to be coming together . It was a longing so intense he wanted to cry . And now the ant struggled to the top of the sand . Tony looked down . A blob the size of a raisin was heaving on his chest . As the Valkyries rode the heavens , it wrenched itself loose and began streaming across Tony 's chest , trailing a long slime of obscene tendrils behind it . It was joined by another blob from the solar plexus . For an instant they reared at each other , writhing to the music , and then they flowed together . There was a single blob now , twice as large , and this was joined by a third and a fourth . From under his shoulder Tony felt a fifth struggle . A strange emotion swept over him : Desolation , such horrible desolation as Tony had never imagined possible - howling outer darkness and loneliness and despair . It was so unnecessary , this pain . Beyond the loneliness was a togetherness where all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tears streamed down his face . " Courage . It will soon be over . " The doctor sat by his side and watched the hosting of the moles . Now ten , now twelve moles melted into one . The thirteenth , which had traveled all the wayf rom Tony 's ankle , arrived and melted gladly into the mass . A respectable-sized slug reared itself on his chest . It drew itself into a finger and swayed back and forth . Dr. Molnar reached down with a long pair of forceps and lifted the slug from its base . At once , it swarmed up the metal . " Naughty , naughty , " he admonished . He laid the forceps across the aquarium . The surface of the water heaved into a glistening hump and drew the small slug into its embrace . Then it sank back and flattened into a shadow . But in that instant Tony had seen that it was huge . It was hard to say how huge because the creature flickered restlessly from one end of the aquarium to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass in a hypnotic tattoo . It made a deep sound like the thump of engines in the bowels of a ship . Tony felt himself drawn to the rhythm in a curious way . He looked down and saw his arms had turned white from his efforts to get free . Dr. Molnar turned off the tape recorder . In the sudden silence the thrumming boomed at its true level . It seemed to move through the earth and vibrate in Tony 's chest and shake apart the glue that held his cells together . It was atrocious and yet ... somehow ... Fun . The thrumming died away . There was only the restless flickering of the shadow as it prowled the tank . Dr. Molnar removed a pair of earplugs and laid them on a table . A door opened . Tony saw several shapes moving around in the next room . One of the shapes approached him : A small , hunched man in a lab coat . It was difficult to tell what nationality the person was because his features were oddly blurred and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a name to it , he would have called it smoky topaz . The man spoke to Dr. Molnar , except that it was n't exactly speech . It was more like the ragged chirp of crickets in a meadow on a summer night . Dr. Molnar nodded and the man wheeled the tank from the study . The door closed . " Not a nice experience , eh ? " the doctor said , undoing the straps and buckles that held Tony to the armchair . " Not nice , " Tony agreed . He stood up and vomited on the carpet . TONY ONLY RETURNED to Dr. Molnar 's office once , or rather he returned to the area . It looked different with the fall leaves turning red and gold . He walked up and down , searching for a small , bronze plaque in the ivy , but he could n't find it . Perhaps it was because he was n't needy enough , or perhaps he had become one of the wrong sort . He was still in possession of eight speckled blacks . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked on a few doors . People looked at him curiously and turned away when he asked for a mole doctor . And yet he was certain that somewhere , either on this block or the next , hidden behind a wall , the shepherd was still gathering his flock : Here , Blue ! Come here , Blue ! Good boy ! When enough of the Many came together , they became the One . He might have passed such a being on the train , holding onto a strap with a damp hand . Or shuffling along a sidewalk after dark , hunting for new territory with abundant food . When it found such a haven - a maternity ward ? A playground ? - did the One become the Many again ? Tony no longer drove everyone crazy with disinfectants and sunscreen . He took Laura to Hawaii and their lovemaking was spectacular . He was promoted at work . He was voted most popular employee by his peers . He was happier than he could ever remember being . And if he had to leave the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Or if he started scratching wildly during American Idol or locked himself in the bathroom and screamed when someone put on a Patsy Cline record-why , everyone is entitled to a few odd moments . By all reports , the rest of his behavior was without blemish .
