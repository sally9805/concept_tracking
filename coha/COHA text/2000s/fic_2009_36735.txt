Carlotta Wren skidded onto the sales floor of the Neiman Marcus at Lenox Square in Atlanta soaked in a flop sweat . Late on her first day back  --  minus ten points . <p> " Welcome back . " <p> Carlotta turned and manufactured a smile for Lindy Russell , her boss , who was standing with arms crossed . " Thank you . It 's good to be back . " <p> Lindy pursed her mouth . " Too bad you could n't make this morning 's staff meeting . " <p> Carlotta 's smile wavered , but she massaged the flexible cast on her arm . " Sorry . This morning was the first time I 'd driven in a while , and my car battery was dead . " She did n't think it would help to mention that the MARTA trains were being single-tracked for construction . Still , she decided not to dwell on transportation challenges since her recent medical leave had come on the heels of a two-week suspension to " get her personal issues worked out . " <p> Personal issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , the fact that her parents were long-lost fugitivesand oh , she 'd been entangled in a couple of murders as a by-product of her part-time hobby as a body mover for the morgue . <p> " Things happen , " Lindy conceded . " Is your arm healing well ? " <p> Carlotta flexed the fingers of the arm that had been broken when a killer had pushed her over the balcony of the Fox Theatre , where she 'd dangled with her skirt around her waist for all the attendees of an Elton John concert to see . " Almost as good as new . " Though , at the moment it was throbbing like a toothache . <p> Sympathy crossed Lindy 's face . " I ca n't tell you how sorry I am about Michael . " <p> Michael Lane , aka the person who 'd pushed her over the balcony , had been Carlotta 's former coworker and friend . He 'd also turned out to have some very dark secrets . <p> " Me , too , " Carlotta murmured , wishing her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't suppose you 've heard from him ? " <p> She shook her head . " I was told he 's in the psych ward at Northside Hospital until he 's deemed competent to stand trial . " <p> " So terrible . " Lindy sighed , then checked the clipboard she held . " Well , life goes on , does n't it ? " <p> Carlotta blinked . It was true , but still <p> " I 'm glad you could come back in time for the Eva McCoy appearance . " Lindy swept her arm toward the small dais that had been erected on the sales floor with several rows of cordoned-off chairs for seating . <p> Olympian Eva McCoy 's return to her hometown had been hyped on all the media outlets for weeks . " That 's today ? " <p> Lindy arched an eyebrow . <p> Carlotta backpedaled . " I mean that 's today . " <p> " Since you missed the staff meeting , here 's the info . " Lindy handed over a memo . " It 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best employees on the floor . " <p> Pleasure suffused Carlotta 's chest  --  her history of being a consistent top salesperson still meant something . <p> " And here 's one now , " Lindy said , looking past Carlotta 's shoulder . Carlotta turned and swallowed a curse when she saw Patricia Alexander , aka Stepford Salesclerk , complete with rounded-collar suit , helmet hair and strand of pearls , walking toward them . <p> The blonde flashed a waxy smile . " I 'd heard you were coming back , Carlotta , but when I did n't see you at this morning 's staff meeting , I assumed that something else had happened . You 're so accident prone . " <p> Carlotta 's mouth tightened . <p> " I 'll let you two catch up for a couple of minutes before the crowd arrives , " Lindy said , handing them each a roll of tickets to be passed out to customers who wanted to meet the guest of honor . Then she gave Carlotta a pointed look . " I tend to agree with Patricia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand today , so try not to do anything that might draw extra attention . " Lindy walked off , leaving Carlotta properly chastised  --  in front of her nemesis . <p> " Ouch , " Patricia chirped . <p> Carlotta was able to hold her tongue because she knew she deserved far worse from her boss than a reprimand for all her mishaps . Determined to get along with Lindy 's new pet employee , she turned toward Patricia . " I suppose you took Michael 's place in Shoes ? " <p> " Yes . It 's such a shame , is n't it , that he turned out to be totally insane ? " <p> Carlotta bit her tongue . <p> " So , I 'll bet you 're happy to be back to work , " Patricia offered . " You were probably bored to tears doing nothing all day . " <p> " I did n't exactly do nothing , " Carlotta muttered , although she could n't exactly tell Patricia about the road trip she 'd taken with Coop for a VIP body pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture of a murderer while she 'd been " incapacitated , " on leave with a broken arm . Instead she pasted on a smile . " But I am happy to be back in my element . " <p> Patricia made rueful noises in her throat . " I hope you had time to rest , you poor thing . The heartbreak you 've been through the past decade  --  you must be close to the brink of insanity yourself . " <p> Carlotta 's hands fisted . Patricia moved in the Buckhead social circles , so she knew the sordid Wren family history  --  that ten years ago Carlotta 's father had been accused of stealing from his investment clients and had skipped town rather than face a trial , with her mother in tow , abandoning Carlotta and her younger brother to fend for themselves . <p> At the thought of her brother , Wesley , Carlotta stole a glance at her watch . He should be arriving at the Fulton County D.A . ' s office right about now , hopefully working out a plea agreement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced charges for his part in the attempted theft of a body . His attorney , Liz , was hopeful that Wesley would get off with having his community service sentence from a prior computer hacking charge extended . But Carlotta was worried that even Liz Fuck-Me Fischer would n't be able to parlay enough sexual favors to make it happen . Carlotta had wanted to go with Wesley today , but he 'd refused , saying it was something he needed to take care of himself . It might have been the moment she 'd been most proud of him . <p> Except for the fact that he could be sitting in a jail cell before her shift ended . <p> What would she do for bail money ? And what if Wesley did n't get out this time ? <p> Patricia waved her hand in front of Carlotta 's face . " Did I lose you ? " <p> " No , " she said , squaring her shoulders . " And I 'm coping with everything just fine . " <p> Patricia leaned in . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot you some antianxiety meds . " <p> " No , thank you , " Carlotta said through gritted teeth , although beneath the cast her arm was hot with pain . Knowing it would really hurt , though , if she slugged the woman , Carlotta changed the subject . " Looks like we 're going to have a big crowd today for Eva McCoy . " <p> " Yeah , speaking of crazy . The woman wins a marathon after a bout of food poisoning , gives all the credit to a lucky charm bracelet and suddenly charm bracelets are selling like mad . " Patricia shook her head , apparently bemused with the trend . <p> Carlotta smirked . Her coworker was only frustrated because she was n't working in Jewelry , earning commissions on the trinkets that Eva would be promoting . <p> Customers were already gathering in the area of the dais where posters featured the smiling , fit Olympian with a gold medal around her neck and a " Lucky Charm Bracelet " on her slender wrist . <p> Carlotta and Patricia positioned themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERE sign and began handing out tickets , and directing early comers where to sit or stand . <p> " So , " Patricia asked without making eye contact . " How are you and Peter Ashford ? " <p> Choosing her words carefully , Carlotta said , " Peter and I are old friends . " <p> " So I 've heard . Tracey Tully Lowenstein belongs to my club . She said that you and Peter used to be quite the item before your family issues . " <p> " That was a long time ago , " Carlotta murmured . <p> " Tracey intimated that you two have picked up where you left off . " <p> " Tracey talks too much , " Carlotta said pointedly . <p> " I think it 's nice that you and Peter have each other , " Patricia said . " You can support each other . You know , with his wife having been murdered , and then all that you 've gone through . " The blonde winced . " Wait a minute . Were n't you a suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little awkward . " <p> " Not at all , " Carlotta said pleasantly . <p> Patricia sniffed and turned her back . <p> Carlotta shot daggers into the woman 's bony shoulder blades . In truth , Carlotta was still wrestling with her recent decision to cozy up to her former fiancT . When her father had walked up to her , unannounced and in disguise , at a rest area a few weeks ago in Florida , he 'd told her to stay close to Peter  --  that since Peter worked for Mashburn &amp; Tully Investments where her father had once been a partner , he was in the best position to help prove Randolph Wren 's innocence . Until that moment , Carlotta would have sworn that if her long-lost father had ever approached her , she would slap him , kick his shins , spit in his face and call the police . Instead she 'd been gelatinous and cooperative and hopeful . <p> The fact that he made her want to believe that he 'd been framed for his white collar crime made her feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  and she was using Peter . Since his wife 's untimely death , Peter had made no secret that he wanted to get back with Carlotta . He 'd even recovered the Cartier engagement ring that she 'd pawned , and he 'd had a diamond added on either side of the original solitaire . He was holding it for her , hoping she 'd agree to pick up where they 'd left off years ago . Just as if he had n't ripped out her heart by turning his back on her when she needed him most . <p> But he was trying to make amends , she conceded . He 'd helped Wesley out of a couple of scrapes and continued to be attentive to her . A couple of weeks ago , though , after she 'd returned from Florida , his patience had worn thin . He 'd been offered a position in New York and had been going to take it , unless she could make room for him in her life . She could n't risk him leaving , on the chance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in need of Peter 's inside access . So she 'd told Peter to stay and had committed herself to making their relationship a priority . <p> Normally , being on the receiving end of a handsome , rich man 's attentions would n't pose a problem , but there were extenuating circumstances . Namely , two other men bouncing around in her head and in her heart . <p> " I wondered if I 'd see you here . " <p> At the sound of a familiar rumbling voice , her pulse spiked . She turned around to see one of those two men , Detective Jack Terry , standing there with a sardonic smile on his ruggedly handsome face , as if she 'd conjured him up . Her entire body smiled . " Hi , Jack . " <p> " Back to work , huh ? " <p> She nodded . " First day . " <p> " Are you okay ? You look flushed . " <p> She put a hand to her warm cheek . " Hectic morning . What are you doing here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a favor for the mayor . " <p> Carlotta frowned . " What does the city have to do with this ? " <p> " Apparently Eva 's uncle is a state senator . He wants APD on the scene just in case . And since a uniform might send the wrong signal " He shrugged . " Here I am . " <p> She surveyed his gray suit and gave his red tie a tug . " You look good . " <p> " I keep telling him that red is his color . " <p> At the sound of a purring voice , Carlotta turned her head . A doe-eyed , exotic beauty in a dark suit stepped into Jack 's personal space . <p> Jack gave the woman a proprietary smile . " Carlotta , I do n't think you 've met my new partner , Detective Maria Marquez . Maria , this is Carlotta Wren , a friend of mine . " <p> Carlotta tried not to react . Friends ? Is that what she and Jack were ? <p> She had seen the woman once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more wow . She was almost as tall as Jack , with killer curves , and caramel-colored hair smoothed back from her face in a clasp at the nape of her neck . <p> " Nice to meet you , Carlotta . " Maria 's English was precise , seasoned with the kind of curling accent that made words like blitzkrieg and psoriasis sound sexy . <p> " Same here , " Carlotta murmured . <p> When she 'd razzed Jack about getting a partner , she 'd envisioned a grumpy middle-aged man with hair in his ears , not a Latina siren with perfect teeth and no wedding ring . Damn , the woman even had good taste  --  her suit was Ellen Tracy and the pumps were Stuart Weitzman . Carlotta knew her own Betsey Johnson tunic dress and Fendi platform sandals could hold their own , but the cast on her arm was an unsightly accessory she could n't wait to be rid of . And she tongued the gap between her front teeth self-consciously . <p> " So you work at Neiman 's ? " Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison of " and I carry a gun " hanging in the air . <p> " That 's right , " Carlotta said . <p> " Carlotta also moonlights for the morgue , " Jack supplied cheerfully . " She 's a body mover . " <p> Carlotta squirmed . The gorgeous giantess packing heat made her feel like an underachiever . And short . <p> " A body mover ? Howdiverse . Is that how the two of you met ? " <p> Carlotta exchanged a glance with Jack . He looked at Maria . " Not exactly . I 'll fill you in later , " he added in a low voice . <p> Great . He 'd tell Maria all about her criminal family  --  her fugitive folks , her delinquent brother Not to mention Carlotta 's own scrapes with the law . And her futile  --  and inept  --  efforts to hold her life and family together . <p> " Speaking of your morbid hobby , how is Coop ? " Jack asked her with wry amusement . <p> Cooper Craft  --  her brother 's body-moving boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who 'd made it known that he would n't mind them being more than friends . Coop was a former medical examiner . He and Jack maintained a relationship that existed primarily of circling each other like two big-racked bucks , but collaborating when necessary . <p> " With this bum arm , I have n't been helping Coop lately , " she said . " And after Wesley conspired with those thugs to steal the body we were hauling from Florida back to Atlantawell , let 's just say he needs to earn back Coop 's trust before they work together again . " <p> Her brother with the genius IQ somehow rationalized making the wrong choice at almost every juncture . She bit her lip and wondered how he was faring in court . <p> " Despite Wesley 's interference , Coop received a lot of attaboys for the way he handled that VIP body pickup  --  and the aftermath , " Jack said . " I hear that Abrams might give him more access to the active cases at the morgue . " <br> Continues ...  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
