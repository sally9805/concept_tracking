" Then my sister , Becky , wanted one , " says Maurrie , who restored and decorated the trailer Becky shipped to her and dubbed it " Ethed Mae , " Maurrie 's friends got into the act and they soon had to number the trailers to keep them straight : Sisters Three ( " Miss Maddie " ) , Sisters Four ( " Mazie " ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this summer 's trip , we 'll be up to Sisters Seven , " says Maurrie . This July , a dozen ladies who call themselves " Sisters on the Fly "  --  will take a two-week road trip to Idaho , Montana , and Wyoming , where they 'll fly-fish , cook out , and bed down in their cozy campers . The trailers are oufitted with 1950s and ' 60s kitchenware , cowgirl-themed linens , and small laxuries like feather beds and down comforters . " We have more fun than anyone , " says Maurrie .
