Chapter One A MAN IN UNIFORM sat across from her . It was a hot afternoon , and the sunlight in the drawing room turned the metal buckle at his waist into a sharp bright square and made the gold buttons on his jacket perfect as coins . A stiff collar surrounded his soft neck . His face was indistinct , unaccustomed to giving orders . She guessed he had been called into the military from a minor profession in the city . " It will be a great adjustment to have the men occupy your house , ma'am . " " Yes , it will be strange . " She attempted a smile . " Had you thought of relocating for the duration of the war ? Staying with family ? " " I have no other family . My late husband arranged for the hospital to be set up here before he enlisted . I encouraged his plan . I 've never considered leaving . It 's my duty to stay . " " You 'll find the patients are a quiet group . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thin , loose over her body , only its dark color gave it weight . She leaned forward . " Tell me , did you give the order to remove the mirrors from the house ? " " No . The head surgeon , Dr. McCleary , gave the orders . Best to have precious things out of harm 's way when the patients arrive . " " Yes . There has been enough destruction . " The major 's hands opened , a gesture of apology . " We 'll leave what we can in place . The lighting fixtures . Some of the draperies . By the way , your chandelier isquite remarkable . " They simultaneously looked up at the ceiling . The chandelier was immense and unlit , its prisms dulled by fine dust , as if a flood of dirty water had risen through the room . When her husband was alive , two servants ' - hall boys had tended the chandeliers , slowly lowering the tinkling , transparent tiers on ropes once a month to be cleaned with feather brushes . The major 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , as if he spoke from a great distance . He had come to cast a spell over the house . A spell of urgent purpose , the soldiers ' mission to spread disruption . She imagined men 's shadows moving through the rooms , swift , black , gigantic , altering each space with the brutality of an eclipse . Others would follow and together they would rob the library of its stillness , strip the dining room of pleasure , disturb the cold core of the well and the lakes . It was 1915 , the first spring since the war started , and her home was being transformed into a military hospital . She sensed the major had asked a question and was waiting for an answer . Yes . She nodded . Yes . Yes . He gently coughed to break the silence . " The weather . Unusual for this time of year . " " It 's a pity , but the rooms may become quite warm when they are fully occupied by soldiers . They were n't designed for such a purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will have someone show you out . " " I 'll find my way . Thank you , ma'am . " From the library window she watched the stout figure in a brown uniform walk straight down the drive without looking at the landscape or the house . She realized that he had no need to observe his surroundings , since everything was already in his possession . The estate had been conquered . Was he carrying a weapon ? Had she seen the curved handle of a pistol ? A sword ? She opened the door to the powder room . There was a small mirror on the wall , and as she adjusted its angle , her reflected hand seemed disconnected from her body . She smudged her initial on the mirror 's dusty surface , ITLITL for Catherine . No last name . She was a widow . She stepped aside and her image slipped out of the mirror cleanly , as if she 'd passed through water . An odorless , bodiless thing . The mirrors were the lakes in the landscape of this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , as all glass and water were related . The immense mirror in the ballroom , a triptych positioned at the heart of the house , was a great pool , a place of transfer , and the other mirrors magically flowed into it , tributaries of silver . When the last mirror was taken down , it would mark a turning point in the fortunes of the house , a darkening of the places formerly stung by light . OFFICIAL PAPERS FROM the military listed the rooms that would be requisitioned to accommodate the wounded soldiers and the hospital staff . All the reflective objects in the public spaces were to be put in storage . The military would take away the mirrors : perhaps they would also demand clocks , watches , other witnesses and timekeepers . Sundials . Calendars . Everyone was concerned with time . How slowly it passed . How long it would be until the war was over . The names of the dead wound through the Times like an immeasurable gray ribbon , filling page after page in small type . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardener and two silent boys , Catherine quickly walked through the Long Gallery into the Pink Drawing Room , stopping before a mirror in a lacquered chinoiserie frame . Held in the unforgiving slant of its rectangular surface , they appeared ill at ease , their faces dilated , her somber crepe dress and the servants ' rough work clothing clumsily shrouding their thickened bodies . " Take this mirror down first . " Catherine struggled to compress her bitter feeling of loss , afraid that the mirror would exaggerate her expression . " As you wish , ma'am . " The mirrors in the next room had even greater age , set in cracked gilt frames , darkened with a lichen-like black growth on their back sides , evidence of time 's poisonous breath . At the corners of the frames hung tiny golden bells that remained silent , poised to delicately protest their descent from the wall . " Remove everything in the room that has a shine or reflection . The clock , the silver bowl , and the vases on the mantel . " A moment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let it tarnish . But take this away too . " She pointed to the mirror set in the door of a cabinet and left them to work . The three servants cleared the mantelpiece , emptied the bureau , secretaire , and kneehole desk . A letter opener , a picture frame , and a compass plated with bright silver were discovered inside a desk compartment lined with scratched green leather . The older boy wrapped them in a flannel cloth and laid them in a box . He picked up a paperweight , a smooth dome of colored glass irresistible as candy . The gardener was n't accustomed to working in the house , and his voice was too loud as he told the boy to put the thing down and fetch a ladder . The boy raced across the bare wood floor , his footsteps shaking the chandelier , jarring its prisms into quivering motion , creating sharp-angled patterns that swept across the walls and ceiling around them , transforming the room into a giant kaleidoscope . Returning with the ladder , he set it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly lifted free from the walls , and the boys carried them to the attic one at a time , where they were laid in rows on the floor . The gardener waited , casting a nervous eye over the huge central mirror hanging in the Pink Drawing Room . When the boys returned , he made them study the mirror on the wall for a full three minutes to familiarize themselves with its weight and fragility . The mirror was more than six feet long and it wobbled and flashed in their hands , as if with its removal from the wall a spell had been broken and it might suddenly become less reliably physical and flow out over the frame . The boys whispered to each other , soft speech a charm against dropping it . Bundled in blankets , the mirror was carried horizontally , the boys as careful as pallbearers maneuvering it through the enormous house , up the front staircase , then to a narrower flight of stairs . Under their sweating hands the blanket around the mirror released a pronounced odor of raw wool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwieldy burden , one of them kicked the attic door . It swung violently open , and they stopped , dazzled by the reflection from the mirrors covering the floor . As they entered the room , a hot line of sunlight leaked through a window , magnifying the mirrors into brilliance so the floor appeared to be flooded with silver water , and they marveled like explorers encountering a strange , unexpected sea . EARLY IN THE EIGHTEENTH century , the owner of the estate had paced the grounds and ordered a number of small ornamental pavilions , follies , and grottos built in the most picturesque locations . Seemingly made for temporary pleasure , some of the structures were as fragile as theatrical scenery , fabricated from porous rock , plaster , limestone , and ancient bricks scavenged from ruins on the property . The walls and ceilings glittered with stalactites , crystal spars , molten glass , or were roughly patterned with fossils , shells , pebbles . The sawed leg bones of oxen had been painstakingly set into one still-intact floor . The structures had long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vandals , and since the gardening staff had volunteered for military service , they had been untended for two seasons . Stone walls and glass had cracked ; streams had clouded with silt . The Chinese temple was near collapse ; the extravagant gilt on the carved , finned fish at the top of its pointed roof had faded to coarse scales . Inside , the painted figures on the walls were clothed in shabby fragments of color that had once been lavish Oriental dress . A temple dedicated to an unknown nymph had lost its faux limestone base , and a mock Gothic tower had a broken parapet . One of the smaller follies had been captured by nets of vines , and the walls of another were half submerged by the lake . Entire buildings and statuaries had been stitched over by threads of grass and weeds , lost to memory . Recently , Catherine had been startled by a sudden gurgle of water , a captive noise below her feet as she stood on a hidden drain near the vinery . The under-butler had pointed out the icehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well nearly twenty-three feet deep . His father had been born on the estate and passed on the living knowledge of a time when this well was filled with ice layered with salt and straw to keep it frozen through the summer months . Now it was empty and echoing , and the spidery steps that clung to its sides were so steeply angled that they induced vertigo in the few who had risked a descent . Months after her husband 's death , Catherine had met a friend at the Carlton Hotel and announced she intended to raze all the ornamental buildings on the estate . " The buildings have no purpose . There is no question that since the war , I have simply lost tolerance for damaged things . I only want to keep what 's worth keeping . " " Oh , leave them be . It 's not as if you need the land , " her friend had answered , bored with the discussion . But Catherine had been insistent . " I want to pull down the buildings and use the materials for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She waited for the flat landscape of winter , the oblivion of snow , to erase her choices . Making choices wearied her . It became Catherine 's habit to listen , convinced she heard the sound of destruction , the wrenching of brick and stone as the ornamental buildings were forced from shape , exposing bare earth underneath to light for the first time in one hundred and forty-nine years . AT A SHATTERING NOISE , crisp as china breaking , Catherine looked up from the letter she was writing . Curious , she put down her fountain pen and left the house . Walking past the lake , she composed a picture of the mirrors as they had been taken down in the house behind her , their brilliant , sharp-angled reflections sweeping across the rooms , passing over silk draperies and painted surfaces without a mark , altering nothing with the cold blankness of their light . The entrance to the grotto was hidden by marsh grass , its door a rounded opening between rough stones . Inside , her eyes adjusted to the taper of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dimness lifted , revealing an intricate pattern on the walls , thousands and thousands of shells , a surface softly lustrous as a fruit stripped of its skin and fragile as porcelain . Catherine stepped forward , her boot blindly crushing the fallen shells into powder . I INTEND TO JOIN my regiment in two weeks ' time , " Catherine 's husband had told her in the Pink Drawing Room . Catherine remembered that as Charles had spoken , a maid approached and the silver tray in the girl 's hands reflected a zigzag of glare into her eyes . Now she understood it had been a warning that a bullet or the flash of an explosion in a field would take his life , destroy their future . Charles had died and she remained in the huge house , surrounded by a constellation of objects collected by generations of his family . Catherine had also been born into a house filled with valuables and was conscious of their inviolability , like a walking stick that was always the correct length for the reach of the arm . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Wood . Stone . Iron . Clay . Gold . Charles 's possessions had been left untouched in his dressing room adjoining the master bedroom , and only two open trunks betrayed his absence . Nearly a year ago , the trunks had been packed according to his list sent from the front : inflatable air cushion , luminous compass , chocolate bars , twill breeches from Sandon , tobacco , tinned pat , scarves , gloves , a heavy wool blanket , and a copy of The Oxford Book of English Verse . Handkerchiefs doused with Catherine 's perfume , Jicky , were tucked into the corners of the trunks . Catherine had imagined him opening a trunk in his tent and , genie-like , the familiar scent of lemon , orris , and bergamot rising , eliminating the elastic distance between them . The news that Charles had been killed on the battlefield arrived before the trunks were shipped . During her earliest stage of mourning , Catherine was pinched with the desire for destruction and had furiously circled the rooms , searching for evidence of tarnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the upholstery , draperies , and carpets had faded as if they had ripened backward . Charles 's death had revealed the truth of the house 's fragility . This house contained many beautiful objects , but she wanted only what Charles had touched . A shagreen box that held his stationery . His fountain pen , his paperweight , the silver bibelots on his desk . A piece of sea glass discovered in a trunk . An umbrella with a mahogany handle his fingers had gripped . The sound of a cup against a saucer when he had set it down . The span his eyes had traveled to a clock . The suspense of waiting as his hand reached to caress her . In the wardrobe , Charles 's jackets retained the shape of his body , fit twelve times by his exacting cutter at Poole &; Co. on Savile Row , so that the lapels unfurled over his clavicle , the shoulder pads defined a handsome curve , the pockets slanted at the angles his hands would enter . Catherine found a camphor-wood box filled with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the soft leather interior held an impression of his fingers , the lines on his palm , the thick horizontal welt of his wedding ring . She knew his skin intimately . Once , after a quarrel , Charles had gently placed his hand on her bare neck , his touch as familiar as stone . When they were first married , she had opened her eyes to find him studying her face . She had slipped from the bed , pressed her hand against the freezing windowpane-snow swirled wildly outside-and then laid her cold palm against his cheek . Her gesture had amused him , but she had made her mark . He was hers . She now tried to restore this encounter , lengthen it , fasten it to words , to their conversation . What had they said to each other ? What was his expression as their eyes met ? Her memory would n't expand . It evaporated , elusive as a taste or scent , trackless as a wave . What she wanted was to be surprised by him again . She craved the image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house and forced her memory to place Charles there , reclaiming him , little by little , from the past . But these glimpses could be created only indirectly . If she studied a chair in the library he appeared at the fireplace . Or if her eyes followed a pattern in the carpet , she could visualize him at the window . He could n't escape her , but she was unable to command him to move , cross the room , walk through the door . He was always a static figure . Why should this be so ? She had believed memory was constant in its appearance , as a fire was always hot . ( Continues ... )
