When the caution flag comes out in Formula One ( F1 ) racing , crews typically use the opportunity to bring their cars in for a pit stop . But when yellow came out in the 25th lap of last year 's Monaco Grand Prix , Team McLaren Mercedes made the counterintuitive decision to keep driver Kimi Raikkonen on the track . The ploy worked ; Raikkonen won . But the decision was n't made at trackside . It came from team leaders based at the McLaren Technology Center in leafy Woking , south of London , who were using prediction software they had developed to help them make split-second tactical decisions in a sport in which speed is king . <P> All F1 teams have their own versions of software that analyzes thousands of variables  --  from weather and road conditions to fuel levels and competitors ' probable actions  --  and how they may interact to affect a car 's performance , before and during a race . The program spits out possible options and assesses the chances of success . Now that racetrack technology is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its partner , British software company SmithBayes Ltd. , are launching a business version of the team 's " decision-engine " software , designed to help companies that face countless variables and constant volatility . " Businesses make a lot of strategic decisions that involve uncertainties this software can track , " says Simon Williams , ceo of SmithBayes . <P> Companies can use the software to measure the risks and rewards of moving into new markets and products or making capital investments . Myriad data and assumptions can be plugged in : competing technologies , changes in government regulations , what rivals may do . The one constant most businesses can count on is churn . " If you know something to be true , it 's already history , " Williams says . Prediction software , he argues , makes it easier for executives to " accept uncertainty and move on . " <P> It also helps companies practice " strategic agility , " a popular management theory endorsed by Donald Sull , a management expert at the London Business School . He argues that chaotic working environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently identifying opportunities and threats and reacting before your rivals , " Sull explains . Team McLaren , for example , had just 10 seconds to make its decision . <P> One major European aerospace company has tested the software . That 's an industry whose products take years to develop and remain in the market for decades but are loaded with electronic components that have the life span of gnats . The company has used the software to trim costs by figuring out the best time to replace many components across several product lines while also introducing product upgrades . " Offering options over time is pretty unique to these guys , " a company executive tells Time .
