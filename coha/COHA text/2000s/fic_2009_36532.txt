Bennie did n't recognize the sound . There were squirrels who sometimes nested in the attic , and barred owls in the nearby woods , and , during the summer , cats in heat prowling the backyard , but the cries he heard were from a place closer to his bedroom . When he was perfectly still , not moving his head on the pillow , every few seconds he would hear the faint crying . He climbed out of bed and crossed the cold pine floor in his boxers . It was still dark out . Standing in the doorway , he listened . It seemed to be in the living room . He felt his way to the standing lamp in the corner and turned the switch , waited , then heard it distinctly , coming from the far wall . He walked closer to the fireplace . The sound was loudest just to the left of the hearth . He put his ear against the plaster . A gentle bump against the lath , and scratching . He imagined a new hole in the eaves-or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something trapped inside the wall , crying . <p> At the bottom of the basement stairs , Bennie grabbed a saber saw and a crowbar from Littlefield 's pegboard , and a pair of canvas gloves and a flashlight from the tool apron . Littlefield would have suggested poison-and he would n't have allowed Bennie to use the saber saw-but Littlefield had gone out to the bar , which meant he was probably now sleeping in his Chevette . When Bennie returned to the living room , he knelt beside the baseboard , listened a final time , then cut a rough rectangle through the plaster . With the crowbar he pried back the lath . He aimed the flashlight into the hole . Eight or ten raccoon eyes looked up at him , little quivering noses pointed toward the light , black fur around the eyes , a stripe of white across the ears and snout . Tiny bandits with miniature claws . They did n't move much but they continued to chatter and cry . He steered the light around the space within the walls and saw only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached through the hole , and pulled them out , one by one , putting them in the cardboard box used for kindling . They did n't resist , though he felt the light touch of their thin claws . When he 'd gotten all five out , he took the box to the porch , set it down , then walked through the breezeway to the barn , where he found the galvanized live-catch trap their sister had once used for opossum in the basement . This plan felt very efficient to him , well conceived . To catch the mother , Bennie baited the trap with an entire tin of sardines . He knew she 'd be back . He looked under the eaves and found a hole beside one of the porch 's support columns . He placed the trap next to the cardboard kindling box , on the corner of the porch , beneath the hole . <p> After switching off all the lights , he got back under the covers . Except for the billowing wind in the spruce trees outside and , occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all was quiet . Bennie 's skin was still cold from the winter night . He tried to relax . He thought about what a victory this had been-the decision to cut the hole , making it the right size , saving the baby raccoons . He 'd find a better place for them . Littlefield would laugh , but he did n't care . He 'd done the right thing . <p> But crying in that box on the porch until morning-it was the first week of March , still bitterly cold-the raccoons would surely freeze . He shook his covers off again , stood up , and walked outside to retrieve the box . He put it on the kitchen table ; the raccoons stayed quiet . <p> Back in bed , Bennie could hear them crying again . He got up , walked to the kitchen , and put the box in the mop closet , then returned to his room . Done . <p> Thirty or forty minutes later , the phone rang . Bennie marched back to the kitchen , this time aware of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise . It was his twin sister , Gwen . She lived in New York . <p> " Littlefield said you did n't want me to come home . For a visit . " <p> " Gwen ? " he asked . " Do you know what time it is ? " <p> " For a visit . You did n't want me around . " <p> " Gwen , that 's ridiculous . Come home . Of course I 'd love to see you . What time is it ? Are you drunk ? " <p> " I did n't think you 'd answer the phone . " <p> " You should n't believe Littlefield when he says something like that . He 's just messing with you . " <p> " I guess I just wanted to make sure . Could I visit next week sometime ? " <p> " It 's your house , too . Of course you can visit . I 'd love you to visit . I 'm kind of asleep right now . Can I call you back ? " <p> " Is Littlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Julian 's , I think . " <p> " Julian 's ? " <p> " Eddie 's , the bar . Now they call it Julian 's . Julian is Eddie 's son . " <p> " Right . That tall guy . I remember him . Really , really tall . Like a freak . " <p> " I 'm asleep , Gwen . Call back tomorrow , okay ? " <p> " Will you pick me up at the airport ? " <p> " When ? " <p> " Next week . When I come . " <p> " Of course . Good night . " <p> " I 'll be there for our birthdays , " she said . <p> Growing up , they 'd always celebrated together-they were born only fifteen minutes apart , on either side of midnight . " That 'd be nice , " he said . " I 'm going to sleep now . " <p> " Wow . Somebody 's grumpy . Next time , just do n't answer the phone . We 'll all be happier , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , he thought about their old family house-its leaky pipes , chipping paint , uneven floors , drafty windows . Baby raccoons in the walls . They called it " the Manse , " which had been a family joke , because the house was not grand or impressive compared to others along the coast , but now that Bennie and Littlefield were in charge , and the porch seemed one or two strong storms away from crumbling into the ocean , and the old copper pipes were failing , rotting the ceilings and the walls , calling the place " the Manse " seemed sad . The last time Gwen had come to visit them-the previous summer-she and Bennie had been sitting on the porch , drinking beer , discussing Gwen 's latest rationale for living in New York and continuing her quest to be an actress . Gwen said that pretending to be another person was invigorating . Bennie wanted to relate this to his own experience , so after he let his sister finish , he took a big sip of beer and said that paintball was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told her that paintball taught him to be careful , and patient , and that he and Littlefield and Julian went out together , competing against a group of sea urchin divers at a year-round course called the Flying Dutchman , sometimes going for a full session without taking more than two or three shots . Two or three gumballs , hopefully kill shots , full of bright-colored sludge . They played every Saturday . <p> When Bennie looked at her after describing this , he knew they were both having the same thought : there 'd been a lot of promise , once . According to their mom at least . He 'd done pretty well in high school . They were the grandchildren of an original member of the Stock Exchange . But while Gwen had decided at Vassar to be an actress ( it took her a few years to get to New York , and she was n't doing much acting , but she 'd landed two small roles at the Brooklyn Family Theater in Park Slope and she had a gig as a temp at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought there might be a time when he 'd start up again-when he would have good ideas about how to put a college degree to use in midcoast Maine-but for now he just wanted to keep the Manse from falling apart . Working at the vet 's office , taking care of the house-that was plenty . He and Gwen were about to turn twenty-seven . <p> The front door banged shut , and from his bed Bennie heard Littlefield knocking his boots against the wall , depositing , Bennie was sure , lumps of snow on the kitchen floor . Bennie heard the sink faucet turn on , and the clink of a glass . Littlefield tromped into the living room . After a brief silence , he said , " My fucking saber saw . Do n't use my saber saw . " <p> " I 'm asleep , " said Bennie . When they 'd moved back into the old house , Bennie had chosen the downstairs bedroom . Most of the time , it was convenient , but there were occasional disadvantages to sleeping near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a hole in the wall ? " <p> Bennie flipped his light on and came to the doorway . " Take off your boots when you come inside . " <p> Littlefield was poking the ashes in the fire , trying to find the coals . He was wearing a black sweatshirt with the hood up . " Those are my sardines in the trap out there . " <p> " Has it sprung yet ? " asked Bennie . <p> " That 's no way to catch an animal . Have a heart ? Please . Have some balls , Bennie . That 's a better motto when you 're catching an animal . Have . Some . Balls . Some scrotal ballast . I should design a grow-a-pair trap and force you to use it . A giant glue trap-with a guillotine . " <p> " Did you look closely ? Maybe it 's already sprung , " Bennie said , walking to the kitchen . It felt satisfying to ignore his brother 's latenight bluster . Bennie held open the door and they walked onto the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the trap . The beam sparkled on the empty trap 's galvanized metal . " Did you talk to Gwen ? " <p> " No , " said Littlefield . <p> " She called tonight . She said you said we did n't want her to visit . " <p> They walked back inside , Bennie holding the door again . Littlefield said , " No . I told her you did n't want her to visit . " <p> Bennie felt a familiar anger rise in his chest . " What ? Why ? " <p> Littlefield crumpled newspaper and laid it on the andirons . " Where 's the kindling box ? " <p> " We 're out of kindling , " said Bennie . He grabbed a wool blanket from the back of the couch , wrapped it around himself , and sat in the rocking chair . <p> " I 'll go chop some , " said Littlefield . <p> " Hold on , " said Bennie . " There 's some in the kitchen . " He retrieved the cardboard box from the mop closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down gently , and opened it . The raccoon babies were clumped together , a mass of wriggling fur , squeaking quietly . <p> He waited for his brother 's reaction . <p> Finally , Littlefield said , " Do you see those rats in that box ? " <p> " They were in the wall , " said Bennie . " They were keeping me up . They 're not rats . They 're raccoons . " <p> " And you put them in that box ? " <p> " I did n't want you to poison them . " <p> " They 'll give you roundworm . The grubs can get into your stomach . They eat your kidneys and your heart . " <p> " The grubs can get in your stomach ? " <p> " If you swallow them . " <p> Bennie knew it was rarely worth arguing details with Littlefield . He handed him the kindling and said , " I 'm just trying to catch the mom . Then I 'll let them all go . " <p> " Get them the hell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be in here . " <p> " After I catch the mom I 'll bring them all down to the ravine . " <p> Littlefield shook his head . He arranged the kindling on top of the newspaper . Bennie closed the box and returned it to the kitchen closet and poured himself a glass of milk . When he got back to the living room , the fire was towering , yellow flames lapping the entrance to the flue . Littlefield was sprawled out on the purple couch , still wearing his boots . <p> Bennie asked , " Why 'd you say that to Gwen ? " <p> " Did n't you tell me you did n't want my friends coming around ? " <p> " Just Skunk and those other guys living in his trailer . " Skunk Gould and Littlefield had thrown an impromptu party at the Manse in January when Bennie was away for the night . They 'd broken windows in the living room and someone had pissed on the rocking chair . <p> " And that you wanted to keep the place neater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do with Gwen ? " <p> " I told her you were dating some girl from Bowdoin . And you did n't want the house to look too messy . In case you brought her back here . " <p> " Admit you do want to see your sister . " <p> " I 'd be happy to see Gwen . " <p> " Admit you 're just being an asshole , " said Bennie . " And for the record , Helen 's not from Bowdoin . She went to Bowdoin College . And she lives in Musquacook . She 's a cook . At Julian 's . " <p> " Impressive ! That 's some real fine cuisine they have down there . I just had their onion rings about an hour ago . Five stars . " <p> " Screw you . She puts together their dinner menu . That kitchen is actually doing a much better job since she started there . " <p> " I 'm telling you-top-shelf onion rings . " Littlefield kissed his fingertips . " Magnifique . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the fry cook , not Helen . " <p> " What a shame , " said Littlefield , closing his eyes . <p> Bennie wrapped himself in the wool blanket again . He rocked back and forth in the chair , staring at the fire . Both brothers were quiet . Within minutes , Littlefield was snoring on the couch . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
