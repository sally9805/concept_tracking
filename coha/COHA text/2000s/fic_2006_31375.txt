From Christmas of the Red Chiefs The bus door opened with a pneumatic whoosh , alongside the Mega-Pumper gas station , and expelled my twelve-year-old stepdaughter Marlie and me on the exhale . Marlie juggled her backpack and fashionably tiny purse while I schlepped a weekender and my tote bag . We were the last two passengers , arriving in a place where neither of us wanted to be  --  my hometown of Bent Tree Creek , California  --  and as we stood there on the asphalt , our ears stinging from a snow-laced breeze and our most recent scathing argument , my heart attempted a swan dive and belly flopped instead . " It so seriously sucks that we do n't even have a car , " Marlie said . Toes curled over the edge of the precipice between childhood and raging adolescence , she 'd recently morphed from a sweet and very girly girl into the reigning mistress of hormonal contempt . I raised the collar of my too-thin coat against the bitter cold and stifled a sigh . These days Marlie did enough sighing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't have reason . Her dad and my husband , Craig Wagner , had been killed in the crash of a small privateplane eighteen months before . Since then , we 'd lost a lot  --  the beach bungalow in San Diego , the family printing business , two cars , and a lot of illusions . At least I 'd lost my illusions . Marlie was still clinging to hers , and who could blame her ? She was so very young , and the world she 'd known before Craig 's death had collapsed around her . Her Real Mother  --  recently , Marlie had taken to capitalizing the words every time she uttered them , lest I think for one moment she was talking about me , mama non grata  --  worked as a pole dancer in some second-rate club in Reno , when she was n't in rehab for alcohol and/or drugs . Brenda , stage name : Bambi , was a subject we mostly avoided . " Yes , " I agreed , remembering my vintage MG roadster with a pang . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My eyes burned , but it was n't an opportune time to cry . I had two rules about shedding tears : I had to be alone , and I had five minutes to feel sorry for myself , max . At first , when I 'd found out Craig had let all but one of his life insurance policies lapse , lied to me about our financial situation in general , and left us with a pile of debt , I 'd actually set one of those little electronic kitchen timers to make sure I did n't go over the time limit for helpless weeping . Of course there had been good times with Craig  --  he 'd been handsome , funny , and full of life , but now those things seemed more like half-forgotten dreams than reality . While the bus driver unloaded the rest of our earthly belongings  --  stuffed into four large suitcases and two moving boxes sealed with copious amounts of duct tape  --  Marlie took in her new surroundings . It was 4:30 on a late-November afternoon , and Bent Tree Creek was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I remembered it . The town is rimmed by pine forests on three sides , but between the exhaust fumes from the bus and the gasoline odor from the Mega-Pumper , I could n't catch even a whiff of evergreen . " Is somebody coming to get us or are we just going to stand here all night ? " Marlie pressed , peevish . I knew she was tired , hungry , and scared , and I wanted to reassure her , not let her see that I was pretty much in the same uncertain place at the moment . I moved to touch her shoulder , but then thought better of the gesture . Seven years before , when Craig and I got married , following a too-short courtship , Marlie was only five , a gawky little thing with moppet eyes and a lisp . After an initial and entirely natural period of wariness , she 'd accepted me as an understudy for the role of Mom , but now I was n't even in the running for the part . Do n't call us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed me for everything , from the federal deficit to our present situation . Oh , yes . If it had n't been for me , Marlie Rose Wagner would be living the perfect life . " I want to go to Reno and move in with Mom , " Marlie said . I bit my lower lip and refrained from pointing out the obvious flaws in that fantasy . Brenda/Bambi had abandoned Marlie when she was two  --  Craig had come home to find his daughter wailing in a playpen in their apartment , wearing a soggy diaper and waving a long-empty bottle . Brenda had n't been back since , and except for the odd email , phone call , birthday card , or box of Christmas candy , she never initiated any sort of contact . Emotionally , I was on the ragged edge . Once I 'd been so sure of myself  --  singing all the time and indulging in one of my favorite hobbies , trying new recipes . Converting standard comfort foods to low-fat , low-calorie versions , much to the delight of my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where had those friends gone ? Where had the joy gone ? When had I stopped singing ? " You know you ca n't go to Reno , " I said , bringing myself firmly back into the present moment , difficult as it was , and with hard-won moderation . It would have been easier to point out that Bambi was n't exactly in the running for Mother of the Year , or offer the kid a ticket and wish her a good trip , but in the first place , I loved Marlie , even if she was n't particularly fond of me , and in the second , we both knew it was a spindly threat . Brenda was too busy being Bambi to bother with a twelve-year-old . The bus pulled out , flinging back a biting spray of slush . Cars came and went from the Mega-Pumper . Families strolled in and out of Roy 's Caf , across the street . Old-fashioned bulb lights edged the windows at Roy 's , and maybe it 's an indication of my state of mind that I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if Delores had forgotten we were coming . Delores Sullivan was my dad 's only sister , and my sole living blood relative , but she and I were n't exactly close . When she 'd called in a panic just a week before and asked if I 'd come back to Bent Tree Creek and help her run Barrels of Carols , I 'd reluctantly agreed . My latest dead-end job had just fizzled and I did n't have another one on the line  --  plus , all my friends had either left Southern California or dived into new relationships , leaving me with just acquaintances , so I was at loose ends in more ways than one . Marlie and I had been camping out in a neighbor 's guest house while the family was in Europe , but now the Brittons were back , with a couple of exchange students in tow , and they needed the space . Meanwhile , back here in the Present Moment , it was getting colder , and darker . I got out my paid-in-advance cellphone , the last vestige of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . Like I said , we were n't close . The little panel read No service . I hoped that was n't a metaphor  --  an omen for the way things would go between Delores and me . " We ought to at least move our stuff , " Marlie said , as the snow began to come down in earnest . " Good idea , " I answered , injecting a lot of false cheer into my voice , and moved to pick up one of the big suitcases . I tend to think in allegories , and just then , those Vuitton knockoffs seemed like more than containers for my clothes . They were symbols of my personal baggage . I 'd gone to college . I 'd fallen in love with a man and built a life , made friends . Refined my cooking skills and sung in a community choir . How could it all have come down to this ? The largest of the bags did n't have wheels and lifting it was out of the question . I was just starting to drag the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van whipped into the lot and came to a stop about three feet in front of Marlie and me . The window on the driver 's side whirred down . A square-jawed man with ebony eyes and dark hair pulled back into a ponytail looked me over pensively . I felt a visceral zap when our gazes connected and immediately took an inner leap back . Once I 'd trusted my instincts , but no more . Craig had cured me of that . I motioned for Marlie to stay behind me . " Are you Sarah ? " asked the van man . There was something tender and knowing in his eyes , but I saw caution there , too . I nodded . " Yes . " Nothing could have prepared me for the sudden flash of his grin . Like a supernova , it transformed his whole face and set something quivering deep inside me . He shoved open the van door and bounded out , one hand extended . Lean and muscular , with an air of controlled power , he wore jeans , a polo shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Delores sent me to pick you up . " I hesitated , then shook his hand . He looked past me , grinned at Marlie . Inside the van , a dog barked , and the faces of two small boys appeared in the window , curious and somehow hopeful . " Are you a serial killer ? " Marlie asked . " No , " Joe Courtland answered , suppressing another nuclear-powered grin . " I 'm a music teacher . " Serial killers and music teachers were n't necessarily exclusive , I reasoned , and he was , after all , driving a van . Plus , there was the electricity , a sort of invisible charge in the air that made me want to chase after the departing bus , get back on , and keep going . " Where 's Delores ? " I asked . There might have been some suspicion in my voice . Like I said , my aunt and I had n't exactly bonded . I barely knew her , and when I needed her most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took my breath away . Joe looked me over thoughtfully , as though taking my measure and finding me a few light-years short of whatever standard he 'd had in mind , then rounded the van and pulled open the rear doors . " She broke her ankle yesterday , " he said , tight-jawed , returning and gripping the handles of the two large suitcases . " Then there was a crisis with one of the carolers . " Delores provided singers for malls , hospitals , office parties , and the like . It was a thriving operation , as I understood it , and with Thanksgiving only a few days away , the heat was probably on . I knew she auditioned people , had them fitted for Victorian costumes , and rented them out . Though the performances were seasonal , the crew rehearsed year-round . I almost said , " I used to sing . " " I see , " I said instead , with a corresponding twinge of sympathetic pain in my own ankle . Not to mention my heart . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for the boxes , one by one . " I guess if he were a serial killer , " Marlie speculated , whispering , " he would n't have a couple of kids and a dog in his van . " " Probably not , " I replied . And so it was decided . We would risk life and limb by accepting a ride . I sat in front , while Marlie climbed into the back , buckling in beside a German shepherd . The kids , identical twin boys about eight years old , looked nothing like their father . They had thick red hair , copious freckles , and both of them wore glasses . " My sons , " Joe explained , after getting behind the wheel again . " Ryan and Sam . The furry one with his tongue hanging out is Dodger . He wo n't bite , though I ca n't make the same promise where the boys are concerned . " The heat spilling from the vents in the van 's dashboard was bliss . I wondered distractedly where Joe 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was home baking pumpkin pies or thawing out a turkey . For some reason , the image made my throat tighten . " I 'm Marlie , " my stepdaughter piped up , evidently speaking to the twins , " and that 's Sarah . She was my dad 's wife until the Cessna he was riding in collided with the side of a mountain . " A thick silence fell in the backseat and Joe slanted a look in my direction . " Marlie likes to shock people , " I said quietly , after an involuntary wince . If Delores and Joe were good enough friends that she could ask him to fetch a pair of shirttail relatives just spilled out of a bus at the Mega-Pumper , then he probably knew about Craig 's death . Delores had sent a sympathy card , but she had n't come to the funeral . " It 's the truth , " Marlie said . I leaned back in the seat and closed my eyes , weary to the marrow . " Our mom died , too , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kind of light traffic you might expect in a town that size . Bent Tree Creek is far enough from Sacramento to be semirural , and close enough that it 's rapidly becoming a bedroom community . " She got sick and then she turned purple . " This time , I was the one slanting the look . " Hepatitis C , " Joe explained . He must have caught my glance out of the corner of his eye , but he was looking straight ahead . All traces of the grin were gone ; the planes of his face seemed grim and angular and I noticed a slight stoop in his broad shoulders . " I 'm sorry , " I told him . " Me , too , " he answered simply . " My mother had hepatitis once , " Marlie said . Yeah , I thought uncharitably , from a needle . Fortunately , it was n't far to Delores 's two-story house . My aunt was waiting on the covered porch when we pulled into the driveway , leaning on her crutches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was company . Her gray hair was cut in a slanted bob and she wore a bulky pullover top and sweatpants with the right leg cut open to accommodate her cast . Even from a distance , I could see that the plaster had been much-autographed . Delores had always had a lot of friends . I just had n't been one of them . She stumped as far as the steps , which looked icy . " Stay where you are , " Joe ordered cordially , standing on the running board to address her over the roof of the van . " One broken ankle is manageable . Two will put you on bed rest for the whole season . " Delores conceded the point with a nod and watched warily as I opened the passenger door and climbed out . Marlie followed , in no hurry . " Cold enough for you ? " Delores called . We 'd always found it hard to talk to each other , and when we did speak , it was usually in clichs . Keep it superficial ; that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd offered me a job and she was taking Marlie and me into her home , and who knew where we 'd be if she had n't . " Cold as a banker 's heart , " I said , keeping up the tradition . Even though he 'd been occupied unloading the luggage and now carried a suitcase in each hand , Joe still managed to get to the gate in the picket fence before Marlie and I did . He set one bag down to reach over and work the latch and stood back to let us go first . " Interesting house , " Marlie murmured . It was the first positive thing she 'd said since we 'd left San Diego a day and a half before , and I was encouraged . I looked up at the familiar frame structure . Both Dad and Delores had grown up in that house , and when I was sixteen , and the latest in a long line of stepmothers had just cleaned out the family bank account , Dad and I moved in . My mother died when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her except that she cried a lot and smelled like freshly laundered sheets drying in the sun . We lived happily in Bent Tree Creek for a couple of years . I went to school , studied hard , and sang with Barrels of Carols  --  second soprano . Then it all collapsed . I was a senior , basically just marking time until graduation , since I 'd already earned all the necessary credits . Delores and I were getting along , considering the usual teenage stuff . Then , suddenly , Dad had a heart attack and died . Delores collected the insurance money , handed it over , and sent me off to college early . I 'd come back to visit , once or twice , and Delores was kind to me , in her busy , distracted way , but I did n't belong . I was obviously in the way , though she 'd never said so outright , and I 'd been too uncomfortable to stay long . " Come inside where it 's warm , " Delores urged quietly , snapping me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlie Rose , " she said , summoning up a smile for my stepdaughter . " It will surely be nice to have a young person around again . " " We 're young persons , " one of the twins pointed out . They 'd both materialized on the porch , along with the dog . Delores ruffled the boys ' hair fondly . " Yes , " she said , " you are . But you live across the street , so I naturally do n't get to see as much of you as I 'd like , and Marlie will be right under this roof . " I should have been glad she was making Marlie welcome . Instead , I just felt shut out . " If you people would move , " Joe said , with affable frustration , from the base of the ice-glazed steps , " I could bring in these bags . " We all trooped into the house , Delores first , hobbling on her crutches , then Marlie , the dog , and the boys . I followed , pausing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I raised my eyes to the large but modest house on the other side of the road . When I lowered my gaze , it collided with Joe 's . Something sparked , then sizzled , and we both looked away quickly . Continues ...
