<p> Mired in bankruptcy reorganization , W.R. Grace &; Co. agreed this year to pay newly installed chief executive Alfred E. Festa a $1.75 million " Chapter 11 emergence bonus "  --  whether or not the chemical company emerges from Chapter 11 , according to a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> General Dynamics Corp . promised last year that , if chairman and chief executive Nicholas D. Chabraja stays at the company through April 2008 , he will be allowed to use corporate aircraft for up to 500 hours during his first decade of retirement . That would be on top of annual retirement pay projected at $2.1 million based on his salary and bonus last year , the defense contractor said in an SEC filing . <p> Coventry Health Care Inc. , an HMO company , gave chairman and former chief executive Allen F. Wise a deal that includes as much as $12,000 for legal , tax and financial planning , an unspecified automobile allowance , 75 hours of personal airplane use and a " tax equalization bonus " to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " according to a regulatory filing . <p> After the company signed that agreement , it reimbursed Wise for the legal fees he incurred negotiating it . <p> Despite increased scrutiny of executive compensation after a series of corporate scandals , the executive suite at many companies remains a charmed place in which boards not only reward executives with rich salaries and bonuses but also help them with such routine expenses as commuting to work and preparing their taxes . <p> They get signing bonuses for taking the job , retention bonuses for staying on the job and a continuing stream of retirement perks to ease them out of the job . They receive stock options to reward them if the stock price rises , and if the stock price falls , they can sometimes renegotiate the terms . <p> In the rarefied world of top executives , " the board basically gives the executive whatever he or she has the chutzpah to ask for , " said Rakesh Khurana , an associate professor at Harvard Business School who teaches a course on corporate governance . <p> After the highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there was a period around 2001 , 2002 when boards felt quite constrained in terms of executive pay and executive perks , " said Randall Thomas , a law professor at Vanderbilt University who studies executive compensation . Now , he said , " it 's not as hot a political topic , " and boards feel free to give executives more . <p> None of the executives contacted for this article agreed to be interviewed . Some did not respond to interview requests . <p> Thomas , however , said top executives " are so sought after that they have enormous bargaining power , " and " they 're negotiating against the backdrop of what the market usually gives people in this position . " <p> That leaves open the question : Why do highly paid executives even ask for perks they could easily afford ? <p> " It 's a sense of entitlement : I 'm entitled to it . I 'm putting so much time into the company , " said William W. George , former chief executive of Medtronic Inc. and a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Executives make a lot of money , so they ought to be able to pay for those things themselves . . . . How far do you want to go ? Groceries ? " <p> Some of the perks and pay arrangements do n't show up in the compensation tables that publicly traded companies are required to include in reports to the SEC . If they appear at all , it 's in the footnotes and fine print , seemingly designed to reward executives more stealthily , said Jesse Fried , a law professor at the University of California , Berkeley , and the co-author of " Pay Without Performance : The Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation . " <p> Fried blames the insular nature of corporate boards for the proliferation of benefits . Current rules make it difficult for shareholders to compete with the slates of candidates that companies present for seats on their boards of directors . Until board elections are more easily contested , significant changes in executive compensation are unlikely , he said . <p> " It 's like so many things in life : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . . . . It 's like keeping a star quarterback happy , " said Joseph E. Bachelder , a lawyer who represents executives in compensation negotiations . " In many cases it would seem like sand in the gears for a director to raise his hand and object to the CEO getting a particular perquisite . . . . No one wants to look like a leper over a relatively immaterial issue . " <p> One executive who makes a point of accepting no salary or bonus and takes almost all of his compensation in stock options had his company pay for professionals to help him manage his wealth . Richard D. Fairbank , chairman and chief executive of Capital One Financial Corp. , last year gained $56.5 million from exercising stock options , and at the end of the year , his unexercised options were worth $560.2 million , the company reported . <p> Fairbank 's $29.5 million pay package last year included $137,386 for " personal financial services , " the company said in an SEC filing . <p> At Coventry Health Care , Dale B. Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January , negotiated an employment contract granting him personal use of an airplane for 50 hours and reimbursing him for taxes on that benefit , the company reported in an SEC filing . He also receives the use of a leased car , which he will keep if he is fired without cause . Plus " all reasonable operating costs . " <p> Based primarily on a grant of one million stock options , Wolf 's pay package last year was worth an estimated $32.3 million , which placed him atop The Washington Post 's annual ranking of total compensation . <p> As for Coventry 's new chairman , after the company executed Wise 's latest contract in September , " the Company paid Mr. Wise 's legal fees and expenses arising in his representation in the preparation of the Agreement and in advising him of its consequences , " Coventry reported . <p> Director John H. Austin , who was chairman of Coventry 's board until the end of last year and chairman of the compensation committee until early November , declined to comment . <p> Lockheed Martin Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retired as chief executive by allowing him to keep options that had not vested . <p> " Generally , retirement before the first vesting date results in forfeiture of the award . Dr. Coffman 's 2004 award was amended to permit continued vesting under the original award terms after his retirement as CEO , " the company said in an SEC filing . <p> Coffman was granted 375,000 options last year with an estimated value of $11.6 million . <p> In a written response to questions , company spokesman Tom Jurkowsky said Lockheed 's compensation committee allowed Coffman 's options to continue vesting " in recognition of the fact that he was going to continue to serve as Chairman of the Board through April 2005 . " <p> Through that period , the compensation committee extended various perquisites for Coffman such as access to corporate aircraft for personal use , a country club membership and as much as $50,000 for moving expenses . After retiring from the board , he was entitled to office space , secretarial support , " computer connectivity " and security for his homes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gwendolyn S. King , who is president of a speechwriting and executive coaching service , did not return calls . <p> General Dynamics negotiated a new contract with Chabraja last year that obligates the company to buy his Virginia home after he retires . <p> Chabraja , who has been a General Dynamics executive since 1993 , received about $340,000 in perks last year as part of his $13.7 million in total estimated compensation . The perks included about $270,000 for personal travel on company planes " as required by the Board to help ensure Mr. Chabraja 's safety and accessibility , " the company reported . <p> The chairman of the General Dynamics compensation committee , retired U.S. Army Gen. George A. Joulwan , said through a company spokesman that he declined to be interviewed . <p> Kendell Pease , a spokesman for the company , said that , as context for Chabraja 's compensation , the company had delivered a 237 percent total return to shareholders over eight years , compared with 85 percent for the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index and 45 percent for S &P's; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-retirement benefits for chairman and recently retired chief executive Paul J. Norris include moving expenses  --  " grossed up to account for applicable income taxes "  --  and compensation for any loss on the sale of his Maryland home , the company reported . The company estimated that moving and related expenses could be worth $440,000 , adding that it did n't expect to have to cover any loss on the sale of Norris 's home . <p> Norris received a retention bonus of $1,235,000 in each of the past two years . For 2003 , the bonus was for staying on the job , but for 2004 , half of it was pegged to the achievement of an earnings target , said company spokesman Greg Euston . <p> " The company decided that it was more appropriate to have some of that retention bonus at risk , and Mr. Norris supported that change , " Euston said . <p> But the same philosophy did not apply to the " Chapter 11 emergence bonus " the company agreed to pay Festa , Norris 's successor as chief executive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bankruptcy proceeding objected to Festa 's Chapter 11 emergence bonus because it " suggested that he was going to be taking the company out of Chapter 11 , " Euston said . " The creditors ' committee objected , and . . . basically it was renamed a retention bonus . " <p> Why would Grace pay its chief executive a bonus just for staying on the job ? <p> " Because managing a company in Chapter 11 is more difficult than managing other companies , " Euston said . " There 's a very high degree of scrutiny from a very smart , intelligent group of lawyers and businesspeople in Chapter 11 . " <p> The chairman of the W.R. Grace compensation committee , former International Business Machines Corp . chairman and chief executive John F. Akers , declined to comment . <p> Companies also have been willing to rewrite the rules when things do not work out for their executives . At Broadwing Corp. , a communications firm , the board 's compensation committee changed the terms of 36,000 options awarded to general counsel Kim D. Larsen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a report to shareholders , the compensation committee said it saw the granting of stock options as a way " to tie executive officer compensation directly to Broadwing 's long-term success and increases in stockholder value . " <p> But in Larsen 's case , the committee cited a different rationale , saying it was adjusting the terms " to provide competitive and balanced compensation as an appropriate retention incentive . " <p> A stock option gives the holder the right to buy a share at a set price , known as the exercise price . If the market price climbs , the holder can sell the stock at a gain . On paper , Larsen 's shares were out of the money because they gave him the right to acquire stock for $33.58 a share at a time when Broadwing was trading on the open market for $24.10 . <p> Larsen still had six and a half years to exercise the options , giving him the potential to profit from future increases in the stock price . But the compensation committee changed the exercise price to $14 a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putative value of $363,600 . <p> Freddie Mac , which has been struggling to rebuild accounting systems and return to timely financial reporting since it disclosed billions of dollars in improper accounting in 2003 , last year paid signing bonuses of $2 million each to its new chief operating officer , Eugene M. McQuade , and a new executive vice president , Patricia L. Cook . The government-chartered mortgage funding company paid chief financial officer Martin F. Baumann a retention bonus of $300,000  --  one year after paying him a signing bonus of $200,000 . <p> Would Baumann have left if Freddie Mac had not paid the retention bonus ? <p> " That did n't come up , " Freddie Mac spokeswoman Shawn Flaherty said . " It was n't an issue , but we wanted to make sure that it did n't become one . "
