<p> Between the city 's gleaming financial district and red-bricked North End , just a few hundred yards from the site of next week 's Democratic National Convention , unused pipes and palettes of wood litter block after block of city streets . <p> They are probably the most famous construction leftovers in the world . <p> For a city desperately working , even now , to put on a Sunday polish for a week of national attention , these reminders of the historically expensive and divisive Big Dig are alarmingly visible . <p> During the convention , the city will point to the near-complete megaproject as a symbol of a visionary " New Boston , " a city that is brainy , innovative , progressive , and tolerant - part Athens , part Silicon Valley , part Greenwich Village . <p> But that 's just one side of Boston 's persona , and the Dig also symbolizes flaws in this city 's character - from neighborhood turf wars to political cronyism that critics cite as a factor behind the project 's huge cost overruns . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension that has characterized this city since colonial days : the struggle between tradition and innovation . <p> That tension emerged as soon as the Puritans debated how best to retain the purity of their holy experiment amid the influence of commercial trade and modern comforts . <p> A fateful intensity , it seems , has always characterized Bostonians ' struggle to shape their city . As John Winthrop , the city 's first leader wrote , Boston was meant to be a " city upon a hill , " an example for the world . <p> Today this metropolis , arguably more than any other major US city , still wrestles with how to preserve its historic character and close-knit neighborhoods while also striving for the elusive prize of being a world-class city . <p> As delegates gather next week , literally in the shadow of Boston 's new answer to the Golden Gate Bridge , this is the context of Boston 's 2004 biography . <p> " I think we 're really at a crossroads , " says Robert David Sullivan , associate editor of CommonWealth magazine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dynamic world-class city , and those who want it to retain its small , local character . " <p> The Big Dig was designed to cut through the tangle of outmoded highways and under the archaic maze of winding streets , allowing Boston 's business to flow at 21st-century volume and velocity . <p> The Dig 's tunnels and suspension bridges have eased congestion somewhat . And the project paves the way for a new greenspace , where trendy shops and luxury condos may prosper . <p> But this is all part of a longstanding , and often controversial process . As the city has welcomed an influx of urban chic in recent years , many believe the city 's modest , working-class character could vanish . <p> Mayor Menino as symbol and a force <p> Many of Boston 's contradictions are embodied in its mayor , Thomas Menino , a quintessential city boss whose bearing seems more suited to construction than the capital . <p> Mayor Menino is from the neighborhood of Hyde Park , and " Da Mayor " has established his political base , block by block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly trying to forge a legacy based on big ideas . It was under his watch , after all , that the Dig seemed to near completion , and he remains the steward over hundreds of real-estate projects sprouting across the city . <p> He 's also a salesman who spends much of his time wooing engines of the information economy , of which Boston , he argues , is the vital part . The city leads the nation in major hospitals , medical schools , and biotechnology firms . In recent years , Boston has attracted more funds from the National Institutes of Health than any other city . <p> And then there 's Harvard , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and the 70 other colleges and universities that call Boston home - and pump $ 5 billion into the local economy each year . On this plane , Boston can be compared to history 's great centers of learning - a modern-day Alexandria , nestled by an East Coast bay . <p> Of course , life-sciences jobs go to those who wear surgical scrubs , not blue collars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old-boy-network of neighborhood pols , increasingly feels left behind . One example : a key city police union is set to picket outside the convention hall next week because of low salaries . <p> State budget cuts in the arts , education , and public health have hit Boston 's poor particularly hard , leaving the city with fewer resources to fight drug addiction and homelessness . <p> The consequence , say public-health advocates , is a startling ratio of 5 black infant deaths to every 1 white infant death - twice the national discrepancy . In Mattapan , a primarily low-income , minority neighborhood , median household income has fallen 17 percent , to $ 32,000 , since 1990 . <p> The engines of neighborhood change <p> For the most part , local disaffection stems from a surge in redevelopment . In Chinatown , for instance , anticipation of the new Rose F. Kennedy Greenway has sent real estate prices soaring , and longtime residents worry about the phasing out of institutions they 've known for generations . <p> " Buildings that were right on the edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown , a partner with the Boston architecture firm CBT . " Now these same buildings have become ideal for new residents . " <p> Major forces of change are sweeping through virtually all of the city 's tight-knit neighborhoods : For the first time , more than half of Boston residents are minorities , drawn by service jobs in universities , hospitals , hotels , and restaurants . <p> In the East Boston neighborhood , for instance , an influx of Cape Verdians , Brazilians , and Haitians are changing the makeup of formerly Irish and Italian schools and parishes . The last decade saw the white population here drop by 26 percent , becoming just half of the overall population . Meanwhile , the Hispanic population has more than doubled . <p> But this historically divided city is in some ways growing more tolerant . And for all its images of discord , there are built-in shock absorbers here to help overcome its gulfs . <p> Several East Boston organizations have gone out of their way to welcome leaders of the Brazilian community into their ranks , a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , says Boston City Councilor Felix Arroyo , whose own election last year was a historic act of unity . While Latinos represent 13 percent of the city 's population , half of them are too young to vote , and half of those who are old enough are not yet US citizens . Nevertheless , a coalition of moderates , liberals , Latinos , blacks , gays , and lesbians , along with liberal and moderate whites , banded together to elect Mr. Arroyo , who was born in Puerto Rico , to an at-large position on the council . <p> " In the past , all ethnic groups had to wait until they could elect their own officials , " he says . " My election shows that it 's a very different Boston . " <p> The tale of South Boston <p> South Boston - Irish , proud , and insular - has proved more stubborn . Like the area around the Big Dig , " Southie " has seen massive redevelopment and construction , and the first signs of gentrification . Residents complain of a half-dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores popping up where they live . <p> To Dave Errico and Jessica Chandler , standing outside the P.S. Deli on Broadway Street on a recent Sunday , it 's nothing less than a disgrace . " They 're making condos out of churches , " says Ms. Chandler . " It used to be a family neighborhood , but it 's lost it . " <p> Yet a fresh start for this historic enclave appeals to those whose emotions are still raw after decades of attempted racial integration . Even after forced school busing began more than 30 years ago , residents deeply resent " Southie 's " reputation as a redoubt of white , Irish prejudice , an image born in part of years of intimidation of the black students who attended school here . <p> " These communities are doing everything they can to help alleviate that stereotype , " says Richard Finnegan , a political science protfessor at Stonyhill College in Easton , Mass . <p> New spotlight on the Catholic Church <p> Yet Boston is also a city that prides itself on being socially progressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 3,000 nonprofit groups and more cultural organizations per capita than both Chicago and New York . But still , after 30 years , experts say the schools remain segregated , and relations between whites and blacks are strained at best . <p> In recent years , though , the problem of race has not dominated media coverage . Instead , the most recent spotlight has fallen on another fundamental Boston presence : the Catholic Church . <p> The clergy sexual-abuse scandal and the archdiocese 's decision to shutter nearly one quarter of its parishes here have marked a low point in the history of Irish Catholicism in Boston , and perhaps in America . <p> But like so many other American institutions , the Church is receiving new life from immigrants . Even as French Canadian , German , Irish , and Italian Catholics move to the suburbs , a surge of Latinos is renewing the Church 's mission , and parishes have grown far more flexible than in years past . <p> " A century ago , when immigrants like Italians came , the Church would say : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " says Boston College history professor James O'Toole . " Now , priests are taking language classes to minister to their new members . It 's quite a shift . " <p> An Irish ascent <p> Boston 's Irish , meanwhile , have achieved a new standard of success after dominating city politics for more than a century . Guys named Finneran and Flaherty still occupy the city 's political thrones . Catholics make up more than half of the state legislature . <p> But it 's the Irish population 's newly won financial power and its historic symbolism that seems to put a smile on the face of so many . Several prominent Irish Catholics , many of them graduates of the Jesuit school Boston College ( BC ) , now lead a stable of major Boston companies . Among them : the financial services firm Fidelity , the advertising firm Hill Holiday , and until a few months ago , Fleet Bank . <p> BC grads recently took pride in occupying their new alumni club in Fleet 's neck-craning downtown headquarters . For an ethnic group long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a potent symbol of Irish achievement . And according to one alumnus , there 's a special pleasure in looking down at the Harvard alumni club across the street . <p> The Red Sox as a unifying force <p> If Boston remains a somewhat divided city , the Red Sox have become a vital force in bringing people together , infusing the city with a passion that 's almost unfathomable for other teams . <p> Bostonians obsess over the Sox for several reasons , not least of which is the fact that they play in America 's oldest ballpark in baseball - a fitting icon for the oldest city in the country . <p> The team has n't won a World Series since 1918 , a legacy exacerbated by Gotham ( and the Yankees ) looming just four hours to the south . <p> " If Boston was the city of the 19th century , New York was the city of the 20th , and there are all sorts of economic and social rivalries mixed in , " says Gleen Stout , author of " Red Sox Century . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has somehow become a means by which fans relive the Puritan tradition of always seeking salvation , while still finding familiarity and masochistic comfort in the status of the eternally doomed . <p> " It 's most interesting when they lose , " says Mr. Stout . " Since loss has been such a part of their experience , when a fan first experiences a loss that seems on par with losses of the past , that 's sort of the membership card . " <p> Even at the holy Fenway , Boston 's contradictions are stark . A soda costs $ 4 . Tickets are the priciest in baseball . Games have become an affair for suburban families and fat-cat professionals . The devotion of working-class fans made Red Sox nation what it is - but along with the rest of the city , that could easily change . <p> ' All politics is local ' <p> What seems eternal , however , is the city 's political bent . Neighborhoods are split into hundreds of fiefdoms , allowing local powerbrokers to concentrate loyalty . <p> With all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their deputies hungry for patronage and advancement , it 's fertile ground for the rivalries and turf battles that endure . <p> That 's the Tip O'Neil " all politics is local " kind of maneuvering that can hoist a man like Menino to a seat of enormous power . <p> And then there are the wonks and policymakers - the graduates of Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government who prefer reading a policy paper to pressing flesh . That 's the Michael Dukakis " cleaning up government " sort of politics that gives Massachusetts its reputation as a bastion of liberalism . <p> The two sides of the party , one parochial , the other intellectual , are simply Boston 's two-sided character reflected in the public square . <p> " We are a one-party , two-ideology city , " says Michael Goldman , a Democratic political strategist . <p> Both philosophies have their own flaws . The Big Dig , which had equal amounts patronage and pie-in-the-sky planning , is example enough . <p> Still , almost like a Boston version of checks-and-balances , the city 's political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominence . <p> The Big Dig and new Greenway clearly mark another opportunity for advancement . Industrial Boston is coming down , and the New Boston is going up . <p> That will at least mean that residents can walk to the harbor without having to navigate around a fleet of traffic . They 'll also see their city as it was , at leat to a degree , almost 400 years ago . <p> Boston will reconnect with its past . What it does with its future is an answer yet unbuilt . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
