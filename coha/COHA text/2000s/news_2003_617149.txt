<p> Farmers in Illinois look out for strangers trying to steal fertilizer . Store clerks in Tennessee report suspicious customers buying large amounts of cold pills . In Colorado , a trailer to wash chemicals off of children from drug-making homes is about to hit the streets . <p> As Georgia struggles with its rapidly growing methamphetamine problem , the core message from other states battling the spread of the illegal stimulant is : Act now , before the problem overwhelms law enforcement , the courts , social services and drug treatment centers . <p> Never before has such a potent drug been so easy and cheap to make . By buying or stealing ingredients and cribbing a recipe from friends or the Internet , a person with very little money can set up a small meth lab  --  and endanger everyone nearby with toxic chemicals , fires and explosions . <p> Like moonshine stills of the past , meth labs are popping up all over Georgia to feed the state 's growing habit . From 1999 to 2003 , the number of labs raided by police jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Methamphetamine is basically homegrown and has moved through communities traditionally that did n't have a problem , " said Dr. H. Westley Clark , director of the federal government 's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment in Maryland . " Because it is homegrown , it has caught people unaware . " <p> No single step will stop meth manufacturers and users , national experts say . <p> " This is not a simple thing , " Clark said . " It requires all levels of community  --  the social service community , the law enforcement community , the faith-based community , the education community and others  --  to focus on it . " <p> In May , Gov . Sonny Perdue signed into law tougher punishments for people who make and sell meth . The law makes it a felony to possess more than 300 of the over-the-counter cold pills needed to make the drug . It also makes it a felony to possess any amount of anhydrous ammonia , a common fertilizer , with the intent of making meth . <p> A Perdue-backed child endangerment bill that would punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upcoming legislative session . <p> Other states are doing more . They 're developing statewide strategies and ramping up large public awareness campaigns ; giving courts and police more tools to deal with methamphetamine makers and suppliers ; creating laws and services to help children from meth-abusing families ; and supporting specialized treatment programs to wean people from the drug . <p> Shannon Herman , 19 , of Douglasville says she used the drug for three years and now faces methamphetamine possession charges . <p> " A lot of my friends are addicted to the stuff , and their parents do n't even know , " she said . " It 's everywhere . " <p> Anti-meth summits <p> California , Washington , Hawaii , Tennessee and other states have held methamphetamine summits in recent years , bringing together politicians , judges , police , teachers , social service workers , church leaders , community organizers and others to create statewide plans for dealing with the problem . <p> Michigan 's Office of Drug Control Policy called such a meeting in March 2002 . Four months later the summit group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronts . <p> Michigan officials distributed videotapes to all sheriff 's departments showing how to spot methamphetamine . The state handed out locks to farmers to safeguard chemicals that meth makers might try to steal . Judges received training on users ' behavior and about treatment and punishment options . The state also has set up a resource Web site . <p> " We got the word out that meth is coming into Michigan , " said David Bush , an inspector for the Michigan State Police . " We did n't want this wave to kill us . " <p> Public awareness <p> A lot of meth is cooked up in makeshift labs using cold medicine and other common materials , such as lithium batteries and matches . And a lot of people have no idea that their neighbors might be making the illegal drug next door . <p> Several states have launched large-scale public awareness campaigns about how to spot a meth lab , as well as the dangers of making and using the drug . <p> California has distributed thousands of educational videos about the drug . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers to community groups and churches . <p> In Arkansas , Pat Huckeby , director of a state-funded drug prevention center , spends much of her time at school meetings , chili suppers and other gatherings , telling people how methamphetamine can hurt people . She recently started training local business leaders how to spot meth abusers among their workers . <p> " If there are three people gathered together and they are willing to listen , I will tell them about the evils of methamphetamine , " Huckeby said . " Public awareness has been a big issue . You still find people who do n't believe it 's out there . " <p> Her agency now sends out a former user to speak about the drug . <p> " He tells people that meth affects everybody . Meth users write bad checks . They take on debts they ca n't pay . They drive under the influence . They hurt or leave their families . All of us pay for the wreckage they leave behind them . " <p> The unique nature of products that meth makers need requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farmers . <p> Tennessee this month began asking store employees to call a toll-free number to report suspicious purchases of items that can be used to make the drug . <p> In Illinois , the state 's farm bureau has joined the public education campaign to teach farmers to watch out for thieves trying to steal a fertilizer , anhydrous ammonia , from tanks on their land . The ammonia  --  which is highly toxic and can burn a person to death  --  is used in one of the more common ways of making meth . <p> Blake Roderick , manager of the Pike County Farm Bureau in west-central Illinois , said farmers started to notice about five years ago that people were tampering with their anhydrous ammonia tanks . <p> The farm bureau has begun distributing warning labels that remind farmers to be on the lookout for suspicious people  --  and also warn thieves that farmers are watching for trouble . The bureau has distributed about 800 stickers so far and plans to put a label on every anhydrous ammonia tank in the state  --  about 30,000 tanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting fences , " Roderick said . " Now it 's something much worse . " <p> Anti-meth laws <p> Many states have passed laws to try to curtail meth making and to step up prosecution of offenders . <p> Illinois law now defines chemicals used to make the drug as " explosive compounds or incendiary devices "  --  allowing prosecutors to charge meth makers with the additional crime of possessing explosives . <p> In Minnesota , a bill proposed last month would require store owners and clerks to keep a close watch on sales of cold medicines containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine . The bill also would create a fund to educate retailers and the public about the dangers of methamphetamine . <p> Cliff Riedel , a prosecutor in Fort Collins , Colo. , said judges have been diverting nonviolent , first-time meth users into special treatment programs , which appear to be having some success . But he said Colorado has been increasing punishments for manufacturers , making it more likely that those convicted will spend time behind bars . <p> " Hopefully , some of them will start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " If you are involved in making it or selling it , you 've got to go to prison . " <p> Protecting children <p> People who expose children to methamphetamine now face severe penalties in several states . Georgia currently has no such laws . <p> Chemical residue and fumes from cooking meth can severely damage a child 's health . In some states , authorities who find children living in meth-lab homes immediately take them outside and scrub them down . <p> One of the toughest statutes is in Missouri , where manufacturing the drug with children present is punishable by up to life in prison . Colorado amended the state 's child abuse statutes to make it a felony to manufacture meth near a child . <p> Washington state law requires police to contact social workers immediately if they find a child at a meth lab . Georgia has no such requirement . <p> New laws are just one way to try to protect children from the drug 's dangers . Drug Endangered Children programs  --  started more than a decade ago in California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho this summer , police , social workers and health workers launched a five-county program requiring that children found in meth-lab homes be medically evaluated within hours , said Idaho State Police Director Dan Charboneau . The program also requires police on drug raids to spend time gathering evidence of child neglect , and calls on prosecutors to crack down on people who make meth with children present . <p> " There are some people in our society who continue to say drugs are a victimless crime , and that 's a lie , " said Monte Stiles , assistant U.S. attorney in Idaho . " Little children are hurt every day . " <p> Communities in Arizona , Oklahoma , Washington , Colorado , Utah , Iowa and Missouri now have such Drug Endangered Children programs . <p> Next month , officials in metro Denver will roll out a traveling decontamination trailer especially for children evacuated from meth labs . The trailer has shower stalls and bright pictures of monkeys and tigers and lions on the walls . <p> " We do n't want to provide any more trauma than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall of the North Metro Fire District . <p> Treatment programs <p> Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that excites the brain and central nervous system . Chronic users who want to quit require special treatment . No drug has been found to help people stop using meth . The most successful programs so far involve intensive therapy , frequent drug testing and months in group treatment centers , according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . <p> Most drug treatment centers , however , do n't tailor programs for methamphetamine users . <p> The federally funded Methamphetamine Treatment Project has set up centers in Western states ; the project is based in Los Angeles and run jointly by the UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs and the Matrix Institute on Addictions . The outpatient treatment , which runs for 16 weeks , uses 12-step techniques similar to Alcoholics Anonymous . <p> Dr. Richard Rawson , a UCLA psychiatry professor and one of the nation 's leading methamphetamine abuse experts , said treatment programs need to last four to six months to be effective . <p> " When they stop taking methamphetamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal , " he said . <p> He also said that frequent urine testing , to make sure people are not using again , is useful . Much of the therapy focuses on coaching the person to develop a life that does not have room for meth abuse . Drug courts in California , he said , have been helpful in forcing meth users to confront their problem . <p> " If put into proper kinds of treatment , meth users can recover , " he said . <p> In South Dakota , the state 's pilot programs for meth treatment are intensive and expensive , says Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Director Gilbert Sudbeck . <p> " You have to be in treatment a lot longer , " Sudbeck said . " We 're talking about probably spending about $350,000 on 20 initial people . But the results have been good so far , and finding a model that works will save us money in the long run .
