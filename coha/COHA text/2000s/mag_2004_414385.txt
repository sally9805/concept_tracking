WHAT WE 'RE RIDING NOW Because he beats the heck out of luggage , deputy editor Michael Frank likes the huge ( 6,800 cu . in. ) , waterproof , rubberized nylon PATAGONIA STELLAR BLACK HOLE ( $145 ; patagonia.com ) . It holds up to a week 's worth of cycling and street clothes . With no square corners to wear quickly , welded seams to prevent fraying threads and a light , 1.5-pound weight , this bag is tough enough for any trek ; the backpack straps make hustling through an airport easy . Though initially skeptical about its unique shape , SoCaI test editor Matt Phillips has fallen in love with the SELLE ITALIA SLR T1 saddle ( $140 , selleitalia.com ) , which mates the back half of his favorite perch , the SeIIe ltalia SI.R , to a blunt , broad and well-padded nose . Phillips found that the Tl , originally designed for triathletes , also makes a great mountain bike saddle-that fat nose is a much more comfortable perch for technical climbing than the needle-like nose of other light saddles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got used to the shape quickly . The rest of the saddle is lightly padded and the thin base has plenty of give for a comfortable ride . At just under 20Og , with hollow Vanox ( a chromoly alloy ) rails , the saddle preserves Phillips'weight-weenie sensibilities , too . For multi-hour rides in Colorado 's whimsical weather , CAMELBAK 'S H.A.W.G. hydration pack ( $100 ; camelbak.com ) is a must-have for contributing writer Joe Lindsey . The 100-ounce bladder is enough for most epics , and no other hydration pack can match CamelBak 's bite valve . His favorite feature ? The load-compression straps , which let him squeeze the pack down to a smaller size . And Lindsey has finally found a sunscreen with no greasy feel . He 's been riding and skiing with PRODERMA SUNSCREEN SPF-30 ( $io/4oz. ; prodermaproducts.com ) for a year and a half and has yet to find a better sports sunblock . It 's even got aloe vera and vitamin E. " Grease ? " chief gear tester Mark Riedy asks , " Not really that exciting , unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where WRENCH FORCE SHOP GRADE GRE ASE ( $9 ; www.trekbikes.com ) comes in . The crystal-clear grease is pressurized and has a precision plastic applicator ; you waste less and do n't muck up your hands . Riedy also loves the less practical but sexier curves and the chrome on the BIANCHI PISTA BAR ( $29 ; bianchiusa.com ) . If Burt Reynolds had a track bike ( the vintage 1980 's Sharky 's Machine Burt ) , he 'd have this brawny chrome bar hanging off the front . Test editor and XC freak Mike Cushionbury has been doing some freeriding lately . To that end he 's been using SPAM 'S ATTACK twist shifter ( $61 ; sram.com ) mated to a Shimano XT rear derailleur . While previous SRAM/Shimano matings have been questionable , the new Attack twister provides spot-on accurate gear changes with comfortable ease . Adding a new , uh , twist is the Low Normal feature on the derailleur , " It 's kinda like a motorcycle now , " Cush says . " Twist back when you speed up ( giving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopping the throttle ) . I 'm just sayin ' . " Executive editor Bill Strickland and deputy editor Michael Frank have been riding the VELOMAX ASCENT Il wheels ( $700 ; velomax.com ) . Strickland finds the superlight hoops ( 615 grams front , 82Og rear ) , spin up fast and do n't suffer wind sheer-but tension is so high that truing takes much tinier adjustments than you 're probably used to . Frank says that while there are lighter , more raceable wheels , the price for similar weight and performance is usually $100 or more higher . The Ascent Il won him over because although they 're superstiff , they 're not at all punishing . Still , they spin up with cunning urgency for sprints , Frank says , and they 'll also hold a steely line in a downhill corner . Finally , Frank found them tough as nails , as more than one encounter with a Hudson Valley , New York , pothole has n't sent either rim even slightly out of true . Strickland is also riding CAMPAGNOLO ZONDAS , a relative bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 96Og rear ; campagnolo.com ) which are bombproof , much quicker than you 'd guess merely from checking the weight , and rock-solid stable at speed and in high-G corners-a spectacular training wheel . Velomax Ascent Il wheels are light and strong . Sidebar <p>
