Chapter One The tall , lean man walked out the entrance of the United Nations building in Manhattan and paused at the top of the main staircase to extract a cigarette from a metal case . He wore a dark gray suit of an expensive cut and a deep blue silk tie . Over that he wore a well-tailored wool coat . He lit his cigarette , snapped the lighter shut , and descended the staircase . He joined the throngs on the sidewalk and walked purposefully , taking no more note of his fellow pedestrians than any other New Yorker . He turned westward on East Forty-sixth Street , which was one-way eastbound and choked with traffic , as usual . Striding along with the pace of a man who has a destination but is not late , he crossed Second , Third , Lexington and Park Avenues , and turned north on Madison . On Forty-eighth , he turned west again . Crossing Fifth Avenue , he took no notice of the crowds or people in front of the plaza at Rockefeller Center , but walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NBC building-he was on his third by then-and went inside . Seven minutes later he was on the Rockefeller Center subway platform . He stepped aboard a southbound F train just before the doors closed and grabbed a bar near the door . The train got under way immediately . As the train roared throughdarkness , the tall man casually examined the faces of his fellow passengers , then stood at ease holding the metal bar . He watched with no apparent interest as people got on and off the train at each stop . In Brooklyn he exited the train , climbed to the street and immediately went back down into the subway station . In minutes he was aboard another F train heading north , back into Manhattan . This time he exited the train at Grand Street in Little Italy . Up on the sidewalk , he began walking south . An hour later the tall man passed the entrance of the Staten Island Ferry and walked into Battery Park . Several times he checked his watch . Once he stopped and lit another cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After fifteen minutes of this , he went back toward the ferry pier and began walking north on Broadway . Three blocks later he caught a northbound taxi . " Seventy-ninth and Riverside Drive , please . " Broadway was a crawl . The taxi driver , a man from the Middle East , mouthed common obscenities at every stoplight . North of Times Square the cab made better time . After he left the taxi , the tall man walked toward the Hudson River . Soon he was strolling the River Walk . He turned onto the pedestrian pier that jutted into the river and walked behind several dozen people standing against the railing facing south . Many had cameras and were shooting pictures of the skyline to the south where the twin towers of the World Trade Center had stood . At the end of the pier were several benches , all empty save one . Four men , two of them policemen in uniform , were turning strollers and tourists away from the bench area , but the tall man walked by them without a word . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis shoes , a faded ski jacket , and wraparound sunglasses that hid his eyes . He had a rolled-up newspaper in his hand . He glanced at the tall man as he approached . " Good morning , Jake , " the tall man said . " Hello , Ilin . " " I 'm clean , I presume . " " Ever since the Rockefeller Center subway station . " The tall man nodded . His name was Janos Ilin , and he was a senior officer in the SVR ( Sluzhba Vneshnei Razvedki ) , the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service , which was the bureaucratic successor to the foreign intelligence arm-the First Chief Directorate-of the Soviet-era KGB . The man in jeans was Rear Admiral Jake Grafton of the United States Navy . He appeared to be in his late forties , had short , thinning hair combed straight back , and a nose that was a size too large for his face . He looked reasonably fit , with a fading tan that suggested he spent time in the sun on a regular basis . " Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake said . Ilin had picked the meeting place . Ilin grinned . " Sometimes the best places are in plain sight . " Ilin stood examining the surroundings . After a minute spent looking south at the southern end of Manhattan , he ran his eyes along the shoreline , the people on the pier , then turned to watch the boats going up and down the Hudson . " That atrocity , " he said , gesturing toward the southern end of Manhattan , " would never have happened in Russia . " Jake Grafton made a noncommittal noise . " I know what you are thinking , " Ilin continued , after a glance at the American . " You are thinking that we would never have given several dozen Arabs the free run of the country , to do whatever they had the money to do , and that is true . But that is not the critical factor . Bin Laden , al-Qaeda , the Islamic Jihad-all those religious fascists know that if they ever pull a stunt like that- " he gestured to the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of the earth and execute them wherever we find them . We will exterminate the lot of them . To the very last man . " " The same way the KGB murdered Hafizullah Amin in Kabul ? " Jake asked . In 1979 KGB special forces disguised in Afghan uniforms assaulted the presidential palace and assassinated the president of Afghanistan , his family , and entourage . Moscow 's handpicked successor asked for Soviet help , which fortunately was immediately at hand since the Red Army had already invaded . " Precisely . But you Americans do n't do things the Russian way . " Ilin got out his cigarette case and lit one . " Thank God . You killed a million Afghanis and lost what , about thirty thousand of your own in Afghanistan ? " " As I recall , you killed four million Vietnamese and lost fifty-eight thousand Americans in your little brushfire war . " " I served that one up , I suppose . " Jake sighed . " Two men followed you to Rockefeller Center . Apparently Russians . Someone over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janos Ilin said . His lips formed the trace of a smile . " Can you describe them ? " Jake reached under his jacket and produced two photos . He handed them to Ilin , who glanced at each one , then passed them back . " I know them . Thanks for coming today . " " Why me ? " Jake Grafton asked as he pocketed the photos . Yesterday Ilin had telephoned Callie Grafton at the Graftons ' apartment in Roslyn , Virginia , and asked for Jake 's office telephone number . Since she knew Ilin-he had worked with her husband the previous year-she gave it to him . Then he telephoned the FBI/CIA Joint Antiterrorism Task Force at CIA headquarters in Langley and asked for Grafton by name . The call came from a pay telephone in New York City . When Grafton came on the line , Ilin asked to meet him in New York the following day . They had set up the meet . Grafton had arranged to have agents monitor Ilin 's progress around New York to ensure he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been waiting on the pier . " I heard you were the senior military liaison officer to the FBI/CIA antiterrorism task force . I know you , so ... " " I do n't think that 's classified information , but I do n't recall anyone doing a press release on my new assignment . " A trace of a smile crossed Ilin 's face . " The fact that I know is my credential . Let 's reserve that topic for a few minutes . " Jake took off his sunglasses , folded them carefully , and put them in a shirt pocket inside his jacket . His eyes , Ilin noticed , were gray and hard as he scrutinized the Russian 's face . " So what are you doing in New York ? Servicing a mole ? " " I came to see you . " " Did the Center send you ? " " No . " Ilin stepped to the railing facing south , which he leaned on . Jake Grafton joined him . A police helicopter buzzed down the river and jets could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the blue sky overhead . Ilin watched them a moment as he finished his cigarette , then tossed the butt into the river . " Islamic terrorists can be placed in three general categories , " Ilin said conversationally . " The foot soldiers are recruited from refugee camps and poor villages throughout the Arab world . These young men are ignorant , usually illiterate , and know little or nothing of the Western world . They are the shock troops and suicide commandos who smite the Israelis and murder tourists in the Arab world . They speak only Arabic . They blend in quite well in Arab society , but are essentially unable to function outside of it . These are the troops that bin Laden and his ilk train as Islamic warriors in Afghanistan and Libya and Iraq . " Grafton nodded . " The second category , if you will , are Arabs with better educations , usually literate , some even possess a technical skill . The fundamentalists actively recruit these people , appeal to their religious sensitivities , wish to convert them to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived outside the Arab world they can move freely in Western society . These people are dangerous . They are the ones who hijacked the airliners that crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon . By the way , the plane that hit the Pentagon was supposed to crash the White House . The one that crashed in Pennsylvania was supposed to hit the Capitol Building . " " Umm , " Jake said . He knew all of this , of course , but Ilin had gone to a lot of trouble to arrange this meeting and he was willing to listen to what he had to say . " The third category of terrorists can be thought of as generals . Bin Laden and his chief lieutenants , financiers , bankers , technical advisers , and so forth . These people are Muslims . For whatever reason , terrorism appeals to their ethnic and religious view of the world . " Ilin paused and glanced around him , almost an automatic gesture . " And there is a fourth category . Few of these people are Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them take pleasure in the pain the terrorists inflict , for every reason under the sun . These people are enemies of America , enemies of Western civilization . I came today to talk to you about several people in this category . " " This fourth group , " Jake mused . " Are any of them Russians ? " " Russians , Germans , French , Egyptians , Japanese , Chinese , Hindu , you name it . America is the big boy in the world-many people have grievances , real and imagined . " " Hate is a powerful emotion , " Jake muttered . " One of America 's many enemies is a Russian general named Petrov . He does n't hate America , he loves money . A few weeks ago he sold four missile warheads for two million dollars . " " To whom ? " " They call themselves the Sword of Islam . Petrov is in charge of a base near Rubtsovsk . The man who led the team that picked up the weapons was Frouq al-Zuair , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayhem for many years . He hacked some tourists to death in Egypt and evaded the roundup of extremists by escaping to Iraq . Who his friends are , where they are , I do n't know . In fact , I am not supposed to know about Petrov or Zuair or the weapons . " " But you do know ? " " A little , yes . " " Is it true ? Or fiction that you are supposed to pass along ? " " True , I think . Although one can never be absolutely sure . And honestly , the Center does n't know I am telling this to you . " " How 'd you hear of it ? " Grafton was shoulder to shoulder with Ilin . " That I ca n't tell you . Suffice it to say that I believe the information is credible . I know of Petrov . He 's capable of a stunt like that . I 'm passing it to the American government to do with as they see fit . For what it 's worth , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not admit it happened even if they did know . They ca n't afford a rupture with the United States . " " Are you saying we ca n't use this information ? " " Your government should n't brace Moscow on it . They 'll deny it . And do n't let my government know where you heard it . I 'm a dead man if it gets back to them . " " I 'll do the best I can . " " So we get around to your question about how I knew you had been assigned to the antiterrorism task force . We have a mole in the CIA . " " Jesus , " Jake muttered , shaking his head . " His name is Richard Doyle . Do n't let him see anything with my name on it . " " What if we arrest him ? " " That 's up to you . As long as he does n't learn that I betrayed him . " " We may use him to feed you disinformation . There 's a spy term for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Doyle is a traitor , " Janos Ilin said softly . " He signed his death warrant when he agreed to spy for the communists fifteen years ago . He 's been living on borrowed time ever since . " " Fifteen years ? " Jake was horrified . Ilin took out his thin metal case , opened it and extracted another cigarette . He played with it in his fingers . His hands , Jake noted , were steady . " Fifteen years ... and now he gets the chop . " " Unfortunately , Mr. Doyle must be sacrificed for a larger cause . " " Who made that decision ? " " I did , " Ilin said without inflection . " A man must take responsibility for the world in which he lives . If he does n't , someone will do it for him , someone like bin Laden , Lenin , Stalin , Hitler , Mao .... Murderous fanatics are always ready to purge us of our ills . " He shrugged . " I happen to believe that the planet is better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't need six billion starving people marooned on it . " " And you ? Are you a traitor ? " " Label me any way you wish . " Ilin grinned savagely . " I do n't want to read about four two-hundred-kiloton nuclear explosions devastating the only superpower left in the world . Russia needs a few friends . " " Where are the weapons now ? " " I do n't know . They could be anywhere on the planet , " Ilin said , and puffed slowly and lazily . Airplanes came and went overhead . The late-winter breeze was out of the west and carried the smell of the Hudson . " What kind of information is the SVR getting from Doyle ? " " That 's an interesting question , " Ilin said , brightening perceptibly . " I do n't see all of the Doyle material , but one listens , makes guesses , surmises . Doyle is quite a source . Almost too good . I got the impression that his control and the Center have wondered at times if perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . From across a surprisingly large spectrum of the intelligence world . " " He 's getting intelligence from someone else inside our government ? " " He 's remarkably well informed . " " Any guesses where some of this other stuff is coming from ? " " Somewhere in the FBI , I would imagine . Counterintelligence . " " Want to give me a sample or two ? " " No . " " The Sword of Islam , " Jake mused . " I 've heard of them . Rumor has it they were involved with something called the Manhattan Project , but we assumed it was that . " Continues ...
