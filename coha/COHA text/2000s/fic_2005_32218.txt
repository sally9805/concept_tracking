Waterwalkers As Hurricane Alicia drifted north-northup the Gulf Coast from Veracruz , Mexico , Sonny Atwill stood outside McCoy 's Lumber hanging no plywood signs in the windows . A gray , blurring rain blew over the parking lot , diffusing the headlights of cars waiting for empty spaces . Horns blared and bleated . In addition to the plywood being gone , the store was low on batteries , masking tape , flashlights , kerosene lanterns , bottled water , sandbags and propane . Originally the Hurricane Center had predicted that Baffin Bay , Texas , would bear the brunt , but revised reports had it heading for Corpus Christi , making landfall that evening . Sonny believed the storm would veer south , go in around Laredo ; he 'd projected its course with a grease pencil on his laminated hurricane map . When he came back inside the store , a woman was sitting at the bottom of a rolling ladder in the cabinet fixtures aisle , crying . She had her face cupped in her hands . He thought to sidestep the hassle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything she would need . This was what he 'd learned over the years : Stay out of it . He was fifty-nine , retired from Coastal Oil Refinery , working ten hours a week at McCoy 's because his doctor wanted him to exercise . Usually he was off on Friday , but when the shipment had unexpectedly arrived last night , the manager had ponied up ten sheets of plywood for Sonny himself to use , plus regular pay , if he would clock in this morning . The woman kept her back to him as she stood . Leave her be , he thought once more-let the husband come . Yet he was drawn to her , reluctantly compelled to suggest other lumberyards and offer the possibility that the storm would spare them . Then , hurriedly , she turned and their eyes met . " Sonny , " she said . He took a single unintentional step backward , emptied and suspended . " My sister , " Nora finally said , but then she fell to weeping again . She wore a white scoop neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lost ten , maybe twenty pounds ; her ring finger was naked . Sonny knelt beside her , vaguely hearing the announcement that McCoy 's would close in fifteen minutes . Whenever his son had been excited , he 'd said butterflies were tickling his palms , and now that seemed the perfect description for the way Sonny felt . Nora wiped her eyes and said , " My sister has huge windows . " For years , he had thrown hurricane parties . Named storms hit four and five times a season , and he would clean out the garage and fry flounder and invite people from the oil refinery . They sat in frayed lawn chairs and drank Schlitz , watching a storm 's edge cut off the horizon like a charcoal sheet and playing cards-Mexican Sweat , Texas Hold'em , Stud-until the wind howled . Then they slipped into plastic ponchos and danced . He 'd mounted a battery-powered radio over the workbench ( to hear the Oilers lose while he fiddled with the lawn mower ) , and they listened to tapes-Anne Murray , George Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartwheeled through the yard . A man from the refinery had brought Janice Steele to the party , then she 'd borrowed Sonny 's phone to call her sister and invite her . When the storm broke up and the others left , Nora stayed . That was 1972 , the year he was named supervisor of an eight-man crew . He was thirty-one , Nora twenty-six . She shelved books at the library while attending the community college at night ; she aimed to earn her teaching certificate . They had been together a few months when he bought the house he 'd been renting on Shamrock Street . She moved in , filling the rooms with her expensive , honeyed shampoos , hanging ivies and matted photographs . Each Sunday they drove to an open-air restaurant on the Laguna Madre and ate baskets of shrimp and hush puppies . One night she said , " Take all away from me , but leave me Ecstasy . " Her voice was so low and cool that his heart stuttered . He asked , " Does that mean you want another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry me . " The wind lifted a corner of the red-checked tablecloth , raising it gently from the slatted table then dropping it again ; waves sloshed heavily against pylons ; the smell of batter and fish and salt-splashed cedar ; the divine heat in his chest , like a ray of light refracted in a jewel . The weather slacked off after mccoy 's closed . Sonny followed Nora to her sister 's on Del Mar Street . The talk-radio station he liked was overrun with storm coverage : Authorities had taken down traffic lights around the harbor and were evacuating boats from the bay ; Alicia 's sustained winds topped 115 miles per hour ; the Navy was tying down vessels in mooring systems and deploying others to sea ; ferry service had been halted , and soon rising tides would close off Padre and Mustang Islands . Residents were advised to bring in pets , stock up on canned goods , caulk bathtub drains and fill the tubs with water . She drove slowly , her brake lights blinking like Morse code . Traffic was bottlenecked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away alicia ! The city 's south side was flooding . Corpus seemed transformed , like a dream version of itself from which a somnolent atmosphere had been cast off ; wind made street signs tremble . What he felt behind the wheel was a long-dormant vulnerability . When he had offered Nora his plywood-it lay in his truck bed , under the camper-she had accepted by saying , " So here we go again . " Del Mar was a wide , palm-lined street , a quarter mile from the bay . The house was a five-bedroom with a French garden and greenhouse that Sonny had helped build ; Janice grew orchids . She was summering in Italy- " with some Guido , " as Nora put it-so she was house-sitting . Janice was an attorney who had never married , and whenever Sonny had passed the house in intervening years , he thought a place so large would depress you to live alone in . Years before , he 'd moved into an all-utilities-paid duplex and put the money from the Shamrock house in mutual funds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , or if she 'd seen the newly painted trim , the garden trellis and oak saplings , the lush elephant ears she 'd never been able to grow . He backed into the gravel driveway , doubting he could finish boarding up before the sky opened again . The house looked larger , the windows higher . Nora had calmed ; maybe she 'd taken a tranquilizer . She greeted him now with a familiar distractedness , an improbable air of casual lightness , as if she 'd just returned from shopping and needed to get some milk into the icebox . Her rejuvenation disappointed him , as did how quickly she disappeared inside . He 'd hoped she might ask his opinion on Alicia , maybe even tear up again . He buckled his tool belt and switched out the bit in the cordless drill he 'd borrowed from McCoy 's . He hoisted each sheet of plywood onto his thigh , held it to the house with his left hand , then screwed the sides , corners , top , bottom . Twice the drill twisted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took breathers between gusts and each breath felt like a spear in his ribs . Hammers banged on nearby streets ; a circular saw whined ; a woman started calling for a pet named Scooter . Sonny tried not to stomp the snapdragons and budding hydrangeas , but that proved impossible . And not unexpectedly he heard Max-the memory of his voice still strong and clear , like a good radio signal . They could 've been sitting in the Shamrock kitchen , the boy 's elbows propped on the newly laid-in countertop , an evening when they studied for the merit badge test . He was eight , fawn-skinned and sharp-cheeked like Nora , fascinated by windmills and in the habit of climbing into their bed after they 'd gone to sleep . Recently he 'd been prone to lying , was in fact currently grounded for it . The restriction opened up the after-supper hours to tie knots and practice splinting broken limbs and to review the history of the Karankawa Indians , the first inhabitants of South Texas : Members of the tribe stood over six feet tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept on dried palms , tattooed themselves from head to foot and smeared the inside of their leaky pottery with asphaltum that had washed ashore . Sonny asked Max for the translation of the tribe 's name . The boy filled his cheeks with air , pouting , stalling , then he exhaled . He said , " Waterwalkers . " " No , " Sonny said . " Dog-raisers . " " But also Waterwalkers , " he said . " They can also be called Waterwalkers . " At Janice 's , the drill twisted again , and Nora said , " Guess you did n't need help . " Her voice made him feel cornered , ashamed . She had changed into a loose sweater , a fisherman 's hat and old sneakers . He 'd liked her in the scoop neck and wished she had n't taken it off , though maybe that was precisely why she had . " Small potatoes , " he said . It was not something he 'd said before , and he had no idea where it had come from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raddled , his mind dull ; he regretted that he had n't shaved before work , that he 'd worn such a wrinkled shirt . " That one would 've been a bugger , " he said . The front of the two-story house across the street was more glass than brick . " Architects , " she said . " Remember ? The Christmas party . " " That 's all a blur for me . The old noggin mixes things up lately . " " I doubt that . But if you 're serious , at least you held out longer than I did . " He returned to the plywood , cranking down already tight screws . He wanted to shy away from solemn conversations . " The first storm of the season , in August , and it just turned Category Four . " " Welcome home , " he said , but the words sounded laden , riven with an inappropriate , boastful enthusiasm . He said , " We 'll get some wind , but she 'll spare us . There 'll be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They always pick pretty names for the first ones . " She had believed this since he 'd known her and had always cited the first storms-Ayla , Antonio , Amelia-to evidence her point . That she still observed it pleased him . A kettle whistled inside Janice 's kitchen , a room where he 'd carved beef for holidays , Super Bowls , the funeral . The night of the architects ' party , he 'd crossed the street for more gin and spied Janice bent over the butcher-block table , the architect biting her neck and groping her breasts . A stiff breeze riffled the palms near the street . Across Ocean Drive , the sky faded downward by degrees , violet to lavender to oyster silver , until at last it softened into a seam of sallow light on the horizon . Nora said , " I boiled water . I thought some tea might take our mind off things . " Once , he 'd seen Janice in the clubhouse of Oso Municipal Golf Course . She 'd played nine holes with partners from the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers through her hair and leaning back to expel plumes of smoke , she resembled Nora . The men around her burst into laughter at a joke she made while fishing through her purse . One of them said , " That is a hole in one , " as she started for the door . Sonny thought he 'd escaped her , then she shuffled over to his booth . He was finishing a Reuben-gratis , like his rounds , because he maintained the course 's carts and sprinklers on weekends-and he was reading about Karankawas . He said , " These fellas used to slather themselves with mud and shark grease . " " Injun Old Spice , " said Janice . Her eyes were red-rimmed , her lips slow . " Repelled mosquitoes , " he said . " They also talked-communicated-with their mouths closed . " " So do those lawyers . " She pointed at them with her chin . Her hair was cropped , highlighted white and gold . Not a style Nora would ever wear , so having confused the resemblance irritated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explain how they would tie lanterns to a mule 's neck and lead it in circles on darkened beaches to attract vessels at sea . A captain would read the distant light as a buoy and steer his boat toward the harbor he assumed it marked . By the time he realized his mistake , he 'd have struck the outer sandbar and the naked Indians would emerge with spears . But now all of that seemed trivial and Sonny explained nothing . He heard himself say , " I have n't gotten a word in a while . " Immediately he wished he 'd not mentioned Nora , and at the same time he wanted Janice to spill what she knew . For a while , he 'd received postcards and late-night weepy calls . He told her that he 'd not contested when Coastal proposed the early retirement ; she said she missed hearing surf reports on the radio , missed good chalupas . He resisted the urge to call her Honey or Love or No-No . They never spoke of Max . Then the communications dwindled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his actions to Nora , not even planning to report them , stripped them of any significance . She had lived in Michigan , Arizona , Nebraska and North Dakota , locales untouched by the ocean , and he knew she would never return to Corpus . His days were incurably wide and ponderous , and at night he fought phantom jealousies of other men . After the retirement , he 'd moved through life like a fugitive , trepidatious and worried that he would meet someone from the old times . If he glimpsed an acquaintance in the supermarket , he lingered on a far-off aisle or abandoned a full cart of groceries and fled to his truck . If someone caught him , at McCoy 's or Oso or a pre-dawn bait stand , his veins surged with dreadful eagerness . Those mundane encounters left him utterly unsure of his identity . No longer a father , no longer a husband . And though he felt on the verge of some old , indolent connection-maybe they felt that , too-he 'd erected such sturdy walls , perfected such inconspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men told him about the refinery hub , which plants were producing more barrels per day , who had passed on and who was stealing compressors to sell out of his garage ; they avoided mention of families . Sonny spoke of golf and fishing ; he told them he was living the life he 'd always worked for . At the clubhouse Janice had run her tongue between her teeth and lips . She was older than Nora by five years , but people had always thought her younger . " She 's working at a bakery . In Ann Arbor , " she said . " But that 's yesterday 's sad tune . I want to hear about good old Sonny . " He said , " I put one foot in front of the other , like a good soldier . &; Continues ...
