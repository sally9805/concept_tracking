An easy-to-build hallway mirror . TEXT AND PHOTOS BY ROSARIO CAPOTOSTO // * 1he simple lines of this mirror make it suitable to fit almost any decorative theme . So if you have a vacant space on a wall in need of an attractive and practical adornment , this elegant beveled mirror could serve nicely . The frame is quick and easy to build , and you do n't need a fullfledged shop to do it . We show you how to do the job with just a few basic hand tools and a portable circular saw.The trick is to use stock lumberyard materials : 2 5/8-in.wide chair-rail molding and 1/2-in.thick x 21/2-in. - wide pine stripping . Of course , you also have to buy a beveled-edge mirror at a glass and mirror shop . Frame Construction Both the face frame and the rear frame are made from two pieces of molding , each 12 ft. long.The stock must be perfectly straight for this project . For easier handling , cut the pieces to rough length . From each piece , cut two pieces 30 in. long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the face frame . Begin by making a mark for a 45 deg miter on the molding 's inside edge . Keep in mind that the dimensions on our diagram are based on molding that is 2 5/8 in. wide . If that is the case with your molding , the short length of each of these pieces will be 23 1/2 in.That is , the inside miter marks are 23 1/2 in. apart . If your molding is of a different width , adjust the length accordingly . Position the molding in the miterbox , and align the miter marks on the molding with the saw kerfs in the box . Use masking tape to hold the moldings firmly in place , and use wood blocks to take up the empty space between the molding and the inner face of the miterbox . The molding should be held firmly against the side of the miterbox opposite you . Start the cut by making a few light backward passes with the saw ( Photo 1 ) . Finish cutting these pieces , and then cut the long face frame pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face frame . Use blocks to take up space behind the molding and to stop it from moving . Apply glue to the miter faces and tape the pieces together . Use a drafting square to ensure the parts meet at 90deg. // Temporarily nail the rear frame pieces together , and use a utility knife to mark the shoulders of the half-lap joints . Nail a cleat across the rear frame pieces . Cut the shoulder , and make parallel cuts with a circular saw . Clamp each rear frame piece to the workbench , and remove the remaining material using a chisel . // Test fit the frame pieces on a flat surface.Then spread glue sparingly on the miter faces , and place the pieces on waxed paper to prevent them from sticking to the workbench . Apply pressure to the miters with masking tape ( Photo 2 ) . Place a drafting square in the corner of the frame to ensure that the pieces remain at 90 deg . Crosscut the rear frame pieces to length ( note that the rear frame pieces are % in. longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizontal and vertical rear frame pieces , and lightly nail them together with 1/2-in. - long brads . Use a utility knife to scribe the cutting lines on the pieces ( Photo 3 ) . Next , after the shoulder lines are scribed , line up the pieces on a workbench , and tack nail a cleat across them . Set a circular saw for a 14-in. cutting depth , and cut the shoulders across the pieces in one pass.Then , use the saw to make a series of parallel cuts ( Photo 4 ) . To finish the half-lap joints , clamp each piece to the bench and then pare away the waste with a sharp chisel ( Photo 5 ) . Temporarily assemble the rear frame by nailing it together with a few brads . Position the face frame over it so there is an even 6-in. - wide reveal on all sides , then tape the inner and outer frames together . Mark the reveal with a pencil ( Photo 6 ) . Disassemble the pieces and clamp them one at a time in a vise . Plane down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , place the frame pieces on the workbench , and glue together the half-lap joints . Drive nails through each joint from both directions ( Photo 8 ) . Use waxed paper under the joints to prevent the glue that squeezes out from sticking to the workbench . Assembly Place the face frame facedown on the workbench , and place the rear frame over it so that the outside edges of each frame are flush to one another . Take a scrap piece of chairrail molding , butt it to a stopblock , and set a combination square to act as a nailing guide . Set the end of the square 's blade so it is aligned with a mark made over the thickest part of the molding ( Photo 9 ) . Using the end of the square 's blade to position a finish nail ensures that the nail will be driven into the thickest part of the face frame . Join the frames together with glue and 1 - in. - long nails driven through the rear frame into the face frame . Place the mirror into the rabbet and install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art-supply stores . Use a putty knife to press glazing points into the rear frame ( Photo 10 ) . To finish the project , apply two coats of spray enamel primer to the face frame followed by two coats of spray enamel . Do this before installing the mirror . FM Photograph Tape the face and rear frames together with an equal reveal on all sides . Mark the rear frame with a pencil . Clamp each rear frame piece in a vise and use a sharp hand plane to remove material down to the pencil line . Spread glue on both surfaces of the rear frame 's half-lap joints . Nail the pieces together from both directions . Photograph Using a scrap piece of molding , set a combination square to act as a guide for nailing the two frames together . Place the mirror and the chipboard backing in the rabbet , and drive glazing points into the frame . // <p>
