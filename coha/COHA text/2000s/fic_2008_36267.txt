A man like me is not supposed to have doubts . Especially not at a time like this , poised in the open fuselage of an Mi-24 assault helicopter , carving a tilted arc around a black square in the grid of lights on Moscow 's south side . This is the worst time to be asking myself questions that ca n't be answered . But lately they 're always there , corroding all those things I once believed so intensely . Defend the motherland , secure our southern flank , protect the innocents . Gripping a canvas strap to brace against the force of our turn , I whisper the words in a soundless incantation . The AMERCO building rises from the darkness , a fiery , open wound torn midway up its south face . Smoke glows in chemical-pink wreaths against the night sky as the helicopter swoops , flares , drops to a hard landing . I leap out while the rotors are still thumping the air in a dying backbeat rhythm . A policeman jumps in front of me . He shouts something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , he yells , but I already know that and more . I circle my finger in the air impatiently , and he points the way to an improvised command center . Charging away from him toward the burnt skyline , I think that what he should have said is that the first blast is less than an hour old . More explosions might come , because at least two terrorists remain alive . I am here to change that . The General 's orders , issued over a scrambled satellite phone , ricochet inside my mind . Do not delay . Do not negotiate . Attack . Dead hostages , destroyed property  --  whatever the costs , they will be less than the price of capitulation . Orders birthed by hard experience fighting a shadowy war against a faceless enemy . Orders that mean I do n't have the luxury of doubt . My path brings me within sight of the blown-out half of the sixth story of the targeted high-rise , the Moscow headquarters of an American oil company . Its southern side gapes like a screaming mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belching smoke . The damage appears worse from here than it did from the helicopter . Moving faster now , I rush past a staging area for the dead and wounded , set back about a hundred meters from the edge of the zone where rounds from the building might reach . Many of the wounded are missing pieces . Limbs , eyes , and , in the case of one shrieking boy , part of his jaw . Each step drives nails into my left foot  --  the foot that is not there  --  a phantom pain , the product of being this close to my old adversaries , entering a world of horror , knowing what is to come . The millennium Moscow bombings in Pushkin Square left 150 dead , the takeover of the House of Culture Theatre 130 , just two among so many others I ca n't bear to think of them all . The worst for me was the Beslan school massacre , during which 344 died , including 186 children . The architects of many such attacks are dead , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a cigar box , but others have risen to take their place . The makeshift command post has been established in the first floor lobby of an office building three blocks away from the one that was bombed . I cross a wide street emptied of traffic . Slam open the steel and glass door . A small group huddled around a folding metal table all turn to stare at me . " Who 's in command ? " My voice sounds loud even to my own ears . " Who wants to know ? " Tall , thin , and spectacled , he looks like a haughty professor , although too young to be one . I know his kind at a glance . A staffer , privileged from birth by his family 's social position in the old Soviet order . His uniform and red beret identify him as a special forces officer of the internal troops of the FSB  --  the principal successor of the KGB  --  but his kind can be found throughout Russia 's military , political , and bureaucratic elites . I throw off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunic beneath . He turns his back to me . " I 'll get with you later , Colonel . " He spits out the words as though he 's trying to rid his mouth of a bad taste . " Now . " He whirls to face me , lips twisted into a snarl . " You 'll not speak again until I address you . Is that  --  " And I am upon him , wrenching him onto the table . It collapses under his weight and the force of the blow . A laptop crashes to the floor with him as he smacks the marble facedown . I plant the heel of my combat boot on the back of his neck . " Who is second in command ? " I say , so softly that everyone in the room leans forward to hear me . A florid-faced policeman snaps smartly to attention . " I am , sir . Inspector Barokov . " The FSB officer under my boot struggles to rise . Or to reach a gun . I pull my Sig , bend down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knock him out . Then nod to the inspector to go on . Still saluting , he tries to draw himself straighter . " The Chechens took the AMERCO offices on the sixth floor . We did n't have time to contact them before a bomb blew . We 're lucky the whole building did n't come down . We do n't know how many are dead , and we ca n't get inside . " He waits for a response . I 'm not surprised the building still stands . Its bones were erected during Stalin 's heyday , when labor was forced at the end of a bayonet and buildings were made of steel , brick , and mortar laced with blood . I flick my right hand toward my brow . He drops his salute , but remains at attention . " Two terrorists are left on the north side of the sixth floor with maybe ten hostages , depending on how many from the office are still alive . " " How do you know all that ? " " They released a hostage to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less what the terrorists want . In my mind 's eye I can see the General 's granite features , like a craggy Neanderthal 's , his heavy lips moving . Do not negotiate . Barokov points with his chin to a woman sitting in a reception chair , doubled up with her hands cupping her face . She appears to be crying . All I can see of her is ash-blond hair and a soot-stained pantsuit with a long rip running down the sleeve . Another uniformed FSB officer , a lieutenant , stands stiffly beside her , but he does nothing to question my authority . He roughly jostles her shoulder to get her attention , and she looks up at him , then turns to face me . She has shell-shocked green eyes wet with tears . She 's overwrought , nervously fingering a blue pendant swinging from a chain around her neck and looking back and forth from me to the officer . " You heard what he said ? " I ask her . " Two terrorists , ten hostages , sixth floor . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . There were two of them . Both on the sixth floor . " Her Russian is bad , with a heavy American accent . I turn away , gathering my thoughts . " Show me the building layout . " Inspector Barokov unrolls faded , tattered blueprints while others set the table upright and then stand aside , looking everywhere except down at the professorial FSB agent oozing blood onto the polished floor . " They 're here , " he says , pointing to a wing of offices toward the middle of the building . " We might be able to get in here . " His finger lands on a stairwell that I can see is accessible only by entering the building directly below where the terrorists are thought to be . I grunt and pull the plans closer , searching for a likelier path , sliding my finger along the crinkled paper to an exterior door on the west side of the building . The portal is tucked beneath an overhang six floors below and roughly thirty-five meters from where the hostages are being held . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And getting there will be a problem . But there are only two of them , so if you can make it inside , the stairs probably wo n't be guarded . " The lock does n't bother me . But he 's understating the difficulty of getting there . The path to the door will be a scramble through the terrorists ' field of fire . The darkness might provide cover , but not if they have night-vision goggles , which they probably do . The American military hands them out in Iraq the way it handed out sticks of chewing gum in France after World War II . Except that in Iraq the goggles are then sold to the people trying to kill American soldiers  --  free enterprise as practiced by Iraqi insurgents . I page through the plans to the structural sheets . The main building is twelve stories high . It narrows six stories up , the center column rising like a thick candle in the middle of a cake . The sixth-floor ceiling is dropped , with a crawl space above it . Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of plans to find the one I want , then consider for a moment , trying to burn the drawing into my mind like light onto a photographic plate . Barokov clears his throat and steps back . The former hostage is still quietly crying . Back at the helicopter a team of five combathardened commandos awaits my orders , and the chatter in my radio , mostly confused shouts , tells me that a separate Vympel antiterrorismunit is deploying nearby . But I can hear the General 's voice in my head , urging me forward . Do not delay . Attack . I turn away from the group and radio my squad leader , talking in a low voice into my hand-cupped mouthpiece . Instruct him to deploy around the perimeter , storm the building at the first sound of fighting , save the hostages if he can , worry about me last . Then I set aside the radio and strip down to black paratrooper pants and tactical body armor over a long-sleeved , collarless shirt made of a body-hugging synthetic . Slide the Sig into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my neck . Take one last look at the plans , and then I 'm out the door , where I wait for a moment while my eyes adjust to the pinkish gloom . " Who the hell was that ? " I hear Inspector Barokov say behind me .
