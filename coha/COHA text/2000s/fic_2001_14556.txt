Setting : A large open room , things arranged as for a public lecture . We see AMBROSE BIERCE  --  a tall , elegant and very capable-looking man  --  alone , standing behind a wooden table ; there is something a little apparitional about his good looks ( And why does not the apparition of a suit of clothes sometimes walk abroad without a ghost in it ? ) ; on the table is a cabbage  --  an elegant , very capable-looking and quite green  --  cabbage : AMBROSE BIERCE Reality , noun .

He told the remnant , Canadian liberty depends on you.On returning to Ohio Uncle Lucius Verus was called before the United States Court at Columbus to answer for his violation of the Neutrality Law of 1818 . Meanwhile , my own family migrated to Horse Cave , Ohio , where I was born on the 24th of June , 1842 . When I was still quite young we moved to Indiana , an even more drab and featureless place . Flat and Dull and , in the summers , unbearably warm.My father , Marcus Aurelius Bierce was of altogether a more somber ( not to mention mediocre ) disposition . And both my parents were afflicted by the madness of religion ; Religion , that daughter of Hope and Fear , who is in the habit of explaining to Ignorance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital A : Abigail Bell , Amelia Josephine , Ann Maria , Addison Byron , Aurelius , Almeda Sophia , Albert Sherwood , Augustus , and yours truly , Ambrose Gwinett.A dream . I am travelling in darkness through a fireswept region . Pools of water glimmer in shallow depressions , as if the fire had been followed by rain . A crimson light burns in the West . Which reminds me in later years of a painting by Dore . Battlements loom up before me . Wandering around in the monstrous building I come into a large room full of the same gleaming phantasmagorical light . Upon a bed a figure lies  --  the features are my own.Early one morning in 1872 I murdered my father  --  an act which made a deep impression on me at the time . This was before my marriage when I was living with my parents in Wisconsin . My father and I were in the library of our home , dividing the proceeds of a burglary which we had committed that night . These consisted of household goods mostly , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well with the napkins , towels and such things , and the silverware was parted pretty nearly equally , but you can see for yourself that when you try to divide a single music-box by two without a remainder you will have trouble . It was that music-box which brought disaster and disgrace upon our family . If we had left it my poor father might now be alive.It was the most exquisite and beautiful piece of workmanship  --  inlaid with costly woods and carven very curiously . It would not only play a great variety of tunes , but would whistle like a quail , bark like a dog , crow every morning at daylight whether it was wound up or not , and break the ten commandments . It was this last mentioned accomplishment that won my father 's heart and caused him to commit the only dishonorable act of his life.Though possibly he would have committed more if he had been spared . He tried to conceal that music-box from me , and declared upon his honor that he had not taken it , though I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the burglary had been undertaken chiefly for the purpose of obtaining it.My father had the music-box hidden under his cloak ; we had worn cloaks by way of disguise . He had solemnly assured me but I knew that he had.A small axe , which we had used to break into the unlucky house , lay between us on the table ; I picked it up . The old man seeing that further concealment was useless took the box from under his cloak and set it on the table . Cut it in two if you prefer that , he said ; I tried to save it from destruction.He was a passionate lover of music and could himself play the concertina with expression and feeling.I said : I do not question the purity of your motive : it would be presumptuous in me to sit in judgement on my father . But business is business , and with this axe I am going to effect a dissolution of our partnership unless you will consent in all future burglaries to wear a bell-punch.No , he said , after some reflection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that you distrusted me.I could not help admiring his spirit and sensitiveness ; for a moment I was proud of him and disposed to overlook his fault , but a glance at the richly jeweled music-box decided me ; and as I said , I removed the old man from this vale of tears.That afternoon I went to the chief of police , told him what I had done and asked his advice . It would be very painful to me if the facts became publicly known . My conduct would be generally condemned ; the newspapers would bring it up against me if ever I should run for office . The chief saw the force of these considerations ; he himself was an assassin of wide experience . He holds up the cabbage.Cabbage , noun . A familiar kitchen vegetable about as large and wise as a human head.Saint , noun . A dead sinner revised and edited . My early schooling was very rudimentary . My uncle Lucius Verus , however , arranged for my attendance at the Kentucky Military Institute . In addition to the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have had occasion to examine them have been invariably amazed by the high quality of the maps and other cartoons that I prepared during the Civil War . But I was only there for a year . The place burned down , and soon after came the war . I returned home and enlisted on April 19th 1861 and was assigned to the 9th Indiana Infantry . This was four days after President Lincoln announced the enforcement of the laws of Union , and requested a volunteer force of 75,000 for that purpose.The 9th Indiana was sent to Virginia , to the Cheat River Valley . That region has ever since been ( for me ) a kind of dreamland , for the first engagements of the war were sham battles , opera bouffe affairs . Many of us Indiana and Ohio boys had never seen a mountain before , and here were we , perched on the crest of the Alleghanies , watching the faint graying of the blue above the main range  --  smoke of the enemy camp.With what pure delight we inhaled its fragrances of spruce and pine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laurel , whose foliage had been accounted excellent for the heads of illustrious Romans . We carved its roots into finger rings and pipes . We gathered spruce-gum and sent it to our sweethearts in letters . Then there is the matter of what I saw , only a few months later , at Shiloh.The 9th Indiana had been held in reserve , and so we were absent when Johnston 's Confederates surprised Grant 's army very early Sunday morning April 9th , 1862 and drove them back to the banks of the Tennessee . But within minutes of the alarum we were running , along with the rest of General Buell 's army , the whole eight miles to Pittsburgh Landing.We passed the last vestiges of forest and came to the place where the battle had raged . Pools of water filled the depressions of earth , discs of rain-water tinged with blood . The force of the fighting was shown by the leafless trees , the blackened stumps . Knapsacks were strewn about and the debris of battle littered the field . Bodies of dead horses were pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; broken timbers dotted the ground as though thrown about by the wind of a hurricane.There were men enough , all dead apparently ; except one who lay near where I halted my platoon  --  a Federal sergeant , variously hurt , who had been a fine giant in his time . He lay face upward , taking in his breath in convulsive , rattling snorts , and blowing it out in sputters of froth which crawled creamily down his cheek . A bullet had clipped a groove in his skull , above the temple ; from this the brain protruded in bosses , dropping off in flakes and strings.Later , I obtained leave to visit a ravine where a company of Illinois men had been surrounded and , refusing to surrender , had been shot to the man . The woods had caught fire and both living and dead had been cremated . Some lay in attitudes denoting sudden death by bullet ; but by far greater number in postures of agony that told of tormenting flame . Some were swollen to double girth ; others shrivelled to manikins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contraction of muscles which had given claws for hands had cursed each countenance with a hideous grin . Faugh ! Those fifteen hours have a grip on my soul to this day . The dark roiling forces of an unseen fate rolled across the plateau ; I know what I saw : heroism go down to unutterable defeat before the ruthless idiocy of chance . For I believe that in the word " chance " we have the human name of a malign and soulless intelligence bestirring himself in earthly affairs with the brute unrest of Enceladus underneath his mountain.History , noun . An account , mostly false , of events , mostly unimportant , which are brought about by rulers , mostly knaves , and soldiers , mostly fools.Historian , noun . A broad-gauge gossip.Ghost , noun . The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.There is one insuperable obstacle to belief in ghosts . A ghost never comes naked : he appears either in a winding sheet or " in his habit as he died " . To believe in him then is to believe that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after there is nothing left of them , but that the same power inheres in textile fabrics.Supposing the products of the loom to have this ability , what object would they have in exercising it ? And why does not the apparition of a suit of clothes sometimes walk about without a ghost in it ? These be riddles of significance . They reach away down and get a convulsive grasp on the very taproot of this flourishing faith.Grave , noun . A place where the dead are laid to await the coming of the medical student.Gravitation , noun . The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a strength proportioned to the quantity of matter they contain  --  the quantity of matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their tendency to approach one another .

Chickamauga.We 'll skip Chickamauga for now.Missionary Ridge . And on and on.First a year . Then another.While serving in the 9th Indiana , I moved with the Army of the Cumberland as it continued South in its march of destruction . The enemy crossed our path at Kennesaw Mountain.On the 23rd day of June , 1864 , General Hazen wrote to his superior : I was ordered to advance my skirmish line , which I attempted to do by sending my topographical engineer , Lieutenant Bierce , to direct it and cause it to be done . While engaged in this duty , Lieutenant Bierce was shot in the head by a musket ball which caused a very dangerous and complicated wound , the ball remaining within the head from which it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were all loaded on flat-cars covered with a tarp and left alone for hours with only the moon to commiserate with our agonies.Went home to Elkhart , Indiana . I saw that it was still flat and dull , and was still unbearably warm in the summer.The farms were rundown ; the towns were deserted ; my head was broken like a walnut.I was finally mustered out of the army at Huntsville , Alabama in January , 1865 . I was brevetted major in August by President Andrew Johnson , for " distinguished service during the war " . The Brevet was of course purely honorary.It had been my good fortune to command a company of soldiers  --  real soldiers . Not professional life-long fighters , the products of European militarism  --  just plain ordinary American , volunteer soldiers , who loved their country and fought for it with never a thought of grabbing it for themselves ; that is a trick which the survivors were taught by gentlemen desiring their votes.Eventually moved West , West to San Francisco . Worked briefly at the U. S. Mint . Stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercantile Library . Read books and began to write for publications like the News-Letter whose managing editor was James Watkins . He taught me how to read . I discovered Swift and Voltaire . Shakespeare and Sir Thomas Browne . He taught me how to write.In one letter to me he mentioned La Rochefoucauld , Murcer and Balzac and explained : " Your method of language is that of these Frenchmen ; your method of thought , meanwhile , is essentially different from theirs ; it is the real English ( or American ) thought and you give us the net result of its processes phrased with the Frenchman 's wit and point and epigram.I came to the conclusion that we think in words . We can not think without them . Shallowness or obscurity of language means shallowness or obscurity of thought . To feel rightly one must think and know rightly . And so I took over the " Town Crier " column for the News-Letter and became a professional writer.All in all this was the San Francisco of the Ancient &amp; Honorable Order of the E.

So scurvy a crew I do not remember outside the carcass of a dead horse . The frosty truth of the situation is that we are a state and a nation of benighted and boasting hypocrites , in whom the moral sense is as dead as Queen Anne at her deadest ; that we are floundering and foundering in a sea of public and private corruption as offensive as that upon which the Ancient Mariner saw the shiny things that ' did crawl with legs ' ; that we are a laughing-stock to Europe and a menace to civilization .

On account of their youth , good character , color , nationality , religion , and the politics of their fathers , they were let off with a reprimand.This is the kind of thing one finds in the majority of our newspapers.To feel rightly one must think and know rightly.Newspapers ! They are faithful to nothing but the follies and vices of our system , while strenuously opposing every intelligent attempt at the elimination of these .

But in consideration of the fact that thou sentest thy only-begotten Son among us , and afforded us the felicity of murdering him ; we would respectfully suggest the propriety of taking into heaven such of us as pay our church dues , giving us an eternity of exalted laziness and absolutely inconceivable fun .

The News-Letter received a series of taunting resolutions from such female suffragers as Eliza Straitlace , Jane Squinteye , and Medora Sawnose to the following effect:THAT whereas the implacable reviler of women and the marriage relation be caught in the pit which he himself digged ; THAT the sympathies of this society and of the world are bestowed upon the heroic woman who has offered herself a victim upon the altar of that dreadful being 's desire to be received into good society ; THAT for her unsuspected , unheralded , and unsurpassed disinterestedness she ought to be relieved at an early date from the purgatory of such a marital existence , into the haven of widowhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; THAT it serves him right.Mollie 's father was an old New York Dutchman by the name of Holland Hines Day ; he 'd struck it rich with the Tintic Mine near Salt Lake City ; he did not oppose the match ; in fact , Mister Day promised the newlyweds an all expenses trip to London .

The weather was hell on my asthma which became worse.Met a lot of the best English writers : Tom Hood , the editor of Fun ; and John Cambden Hotten , publisher of both Twain and Artemus Ward . It was Hotten who suggested I publish my first two books : Nuggets and Dust and Cobwebs from an Empty Skull . The Fiend 's Delight followed in 1874 . Had a great deal to worry about : more work than I could do ; Mollie having two babies and a nursemaid to look after . Yes , up to my ears in work , grinding stuff for five publications : one semi-weekly , two weeklies , one monthly , and one occasional  --  a pizen thing of which I wrote every line.In the Spring of 1875 my wife decided to return to America ; when she got there I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been the case I probably should have stayed , but no.When John Hotten died , shortly before my own departure , a group of his friends gathered to see who could come up with the best epitaph : ?

Black.Returned home in the fall of 1875 and spent most of the winter with wife and children in San Francisco , where we lived at the home of Mr and Mrs Day on Vallejo Street.Took a brief holiday in December to Calistoga Hot Springs , and spent time in Napa . Began to think about my experiences . In the war . In the woods . In England I had almost forgotten about the strangeness of the woods.He to whom the portentous conspiracy of night and silence and solitude in the heart of a great forest is not an unknown experience needs not to be told what another world it all is . How even the most commonplace and familiar objects take on another character.There are sounds without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects which have not been seen to move , movements wherein nothing is observed to change its place . Ah , children of the sunlight and the gaslight , how little you know of the world in which you live.Surrounded at a little distance by armed and watchful friends Byring felt utterly alone . Yielding himself to the solemn and mysterious spirit of the time and place , he had forgotten the nature of his connection with the visible and audible aspects and phases of the night . The forest was boundless ; men and the habitations of men did not exist . The universe was one primeval mystery of darkness without form and void , himself the sole , dumb questioner of its eternal secret . Absorbed in thoughts born of this mood , he suffered the time to slip away unnoted . Meantime the infrequent patches of white light lying amongst the tree-trunks had undergone changes of size , form and place . In one of them near by , just at the roadside , his eye fell upon an object that he had not previously observed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have sworn that it had not before been there . It was partly covered in shadow , but he could see that it was a human figure . Instinctively he adjusted the clasp of his sword-belt and laid hold of his pistol  --  again he was in a world of war , by occupation an assassin.The figure did not move . Rising , pistol in hand he approached . The figure lay upon its back , the upper part in shadow , but standing above it and looking down upon the face , he saw that it was a dead body . He shuddered and turned from it with a feeling of sickness and disgust , resumed his seat upon the log , and forgetting military prudence struck a match and lit a cigar . In the sudden blackness that followed the extinction of the flame he felt a sense of relief ; he could no longer see the object of his aversion . Nevertheless , he kept his eyes set in that direction until it appeared again with growing distinctness . It seemed to have moved a trifle nearer.Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Early the next morning a fatigue-party , commanded by a captain and accompanied by a surgeon , searched the ground for dead and wounded . At the fork of the road , a little to one side , they found two bodies lying close together  --  that of a Federal officer and that of a Confederate private . The officer had died of a sword thrust through the heart , but not apparently , until he had inflicted upon his enemy no fewer than five dreadful wounds . The dead officer lay on his face in a pool of blood , the weapon still in his breast . They turned him on his back , and the surgeon removed it . Gad , said the captain , it is Byring , adding with a glance at the other , they had a tough tussle.The surgeon examined the sword . It was that of a line officer of the Federal infantry  --  exactly like the one worn by the captain . It was , in fact , Byrings ' own .

In order to avoid a conflict , the Moral Principle resumed somewhat uneasily , I shall myself lie down and let you walk over me .

I do n't think you are very good walking , it said , I am a little particular about what I have underfoot . Suppose you get off into the water . It occurred that way.In the winter of 1889 I made an accidental discovery of some love letters written to Mollie by a certain Danish gentleman who had been summering in St Helena . I told her , I do n't take part in competitions  --  even in love.There was a scene . She swore to me that there was nothing to it , that there was no real romance . I would not listen to her , and moved my things to Sunol . She was the only woman I ever loved . Once in St Helena the local pastor came to call on Mrs Bierce . Young Leigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just heard Day ( my other son ) say " Damn god " .

Day applied for a license , found a minister and invited a few guests , for the wedding to be held July 22nd.But the Adkins girl slipped out of the house by a ruse and eloped with Neil Hubbs , Day 's best friend .

But he too had been wounded , staggered back to the hotel , crawled to his rented room , got on the bed , put another cartridge into his pistol , laid a cloth saturated with chloroform over his face , then placing the pistol to his right temple , fired it , blowing his brains out over the counterpane.Both had begun to shoot at the same time , both died .

" Does there not rest upon his father a haunting fear lest he may have transmuted to a sensitive and tender soul an inheritance which resulted in crime and death , while he was cultivating the gift of wounding natures just as sensitive and tender , who had not the courage to end them in murder and self-destruction ?

I found a young man , the youngest man , it seemed to me , that I had ever confronted . His appearance , his attitude , his entire personality suggested extreme diffidence . I did not ask him in , instate him in my better chair ( I had two ) and inquire how we might serve each other.If my memory is not at fault , I merely said , well , and awaited the result.I am from the San Francisco Examiner , he exclaimed in a voice like the fragrance of violets made audible , and backed a little away . Oh , I said , you come from Mister Hearst.Then that unearthly child lifted its blue eyes and cooed : I am Mister Hearst . . The rest is a matter of historical record . I became the " Prattler " , for the princely sum of thirty-five dollars a week.Already in those days , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the way in which our democratic system seemed especially vulnerable in this regard . Of course , I had had some practice in this doleful study.Back in ' 77 I had written of President Hayes : Lincoln and Grant were each difficult creatures to admire , but Hayes  --  Hayes is only a magic lantern without even a surface to be displayed upon . You can not see him , you can not feel him ; but you know that he extends in lessening opacity all the way from the dark side of John Sherman ( the Senator from Ohio ) to the confines of outer space.And more recently  --  in the same vein : When a prominent industrialist , Anthony Chabot , died I observed  --  The personal property of the late Anthony Chabot of Oakland has been ordered sold . This is a noble opportunity to obtain Senator Vrooman . .

Compulsion , noun . The eloquence of power.Duty , noun . That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit , along the line of desire.Day , noun . A period of twenty-four hours , mostly misspent.Things livened up a bit in early 1896 ; Hearst wired me from New York : Railroad combination so strong in Washington that seems almost impossible to break them up , yet it is certainly the duty of all having interests of coast at heart to make the most strenuous efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I replied . I shall be glad to do whatever I can toward defeating Mr Huntington 's Funding Bill and shall start for Washington on Monday evening next.Collis P. Huntington was the sole surviving appendage of the Bay Area Big Four  --  tycoons and swindlers  --  that had included Mark Hopkins , Charles Crocker , and Leland Stanford , by 1896 the latter three all mercifully dead.The Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads had been built using public monies loaned out at a reasonable rate of interest . The railroad men had enriched themselves enormously , at public expense , and had failed to make anything more than token repayment of either interest or principle ( an amount conservatively estimated at seventy-five million dollars ) . Mr Huntington 's Funding Bill was a ruse not merely intended to delay repayment for another thirty years , but in effect to assure that the issue of repayment would never be forced . The chief lobbyist for the corrupt and depraved railroad contingent in congress was one John Boyd , whom I referred to as Huntington 's tapeworm.My first article began : Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is merciful . He tempers invective with falsehood . That is , although he says ugly things of the enemy , he has the tenderness to be careful that they are mainly lies.Mr Huntington appeared before the Committee and took his hands out of all pockets long enough to be sworn . The spectacle of this old man standing on the brink of eternity , his pockets loaded with dishonest gold which he knows neither how to enjoy nor to whom to bequeath was one of the most pitiable it has been my lot to observe . He knows himself an outmate of every penal institution in the world ; he deserves to hang from every branch of every tree of every state and territory penetrated by his railroads , with the sole exception of Nevada , which has no trees.I called him an inflated old pigskin.I called him a veteran calumniator.I called him a promoted peasant.I called him the swine of the century.Of our modern forty thieves , Mister Huntington is the surviving thirty-six.One day I encountered Mister Huntington on the steps of the Capitol.Previously I had declined Huntington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered . Met with stony rejection Huntington finally shouted : Well , name your price ; every man has a price.My price is seventy-five million dollars , and you might make it payable to my good friend , the Secretary of the Treasury.Later on someone asked the old reptile why he had approached me . Oh , I just wanted to see how big he was . And then added , now I know.But that was the mauve decade . Once at the home of a western family who had recently acquired a vast fortune , I was admonished by the hostess to notice her " spinal " staircase.In January 1897 the Funding Bill was defeated and I returned to San Francisco.But I was tired of journalism ; and I was getting tired of Hearst ; and Hearst , in his turn , was getting tired of me . Our quarrel began over the man of the hour , and the savior proclaimed by all the Hearst papers , William Jennings Bryan.Of whom I wrote.Mister Bryan 's creation was the unstudied act of his own larynx ; it said , Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was coming to be just an eccentric gentleman whose whim must be humored if possible , although there is no penalty if I am treated with disrespect . And I was treated with disrespect : The idiots began to edit me , me ! Can you believe it ? Grammar , noun . A system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for the feet of the self-made man , along the path by which he advances to distinction . Diaphragm , noun . A muscular partition separating disorders of the chest , from disorders of the bowels.Dejeuner , noun . The breakfast of an American who has been in Paris , variously pronounced.My name is Boffer Bings . I was born of honest parents in one of the humbler walks of life , my father being a manufacturer of dog-oil and my mother having a small studio in the shadow of the village church where she disposed of unwelcome babes . In my boyhood I was trained to habits of industry ; I not only assisted my father in procuring dogs for his vats , but was frequently employed by my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio.My father has , as silent partners , all the physicians of the town , who seldom wrote a prescription which did not contain what they were pleased to designate as Oil of Dog . It is really the most valuable medicine ever discovered . But most persons are unwilling to make personal sacrifice for the afflicted , and it was evident that many of the fattest dogs in town were forbidden to play with me  --  a fact which pained my young sensibilities , and at one time came near driving me to became a pirate.My father was a deodorizer of dead dogs , my mother kept the only shop for the sale of cat 's meat in my native city . They did not live happily ; the difference in social rank was a chasm which could not be bridged by the vows of marriage . One morning after the customary squabbles at breakfast my father rose from the table , quivering and pale with wrath , and proceeding to the parsonage thrashed the clergyman who had performed the marriage ceremonyResolutions of Congress , February 15 , 1862 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hereby tendered , to Brigadier-General Jupiter Doke and the gallant men under his command for their unparalleled feat of attacking  --  themselves only 2000 strong  --  a Confederate army of 25,000 and utterly overthrowing it , killing 5327 , making prisoners of 19,003 , of whom more than half were wounded , taking 32 guns , 20,000 stand of small arms and , in short , the enemy 's entire equipment.Resolved , That for his unexampled victory the President be requested to designate a day of thanksgiving and public celebration of religious rites in the various churches.Resolved , That he be requested , in further commemoration of the great event , and in reward of the gallant spirits whose deeds have added such imperishable lustre to the American arms , to appoint , with the advice and consent of the Senate the following officer:One Major-General.Statement of Mister Hannibal Alcazar Peyton , of Jayhawk , Kentucky.Dat wus a almighty dark night , sho ' and dese yere ole eyes ai n't wuf shucks , but I 's got a year like a sque'l , an ' w'en I cotch de mummeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side o ' de ribber .

Who but a failed critic would read anything with so lame an appellation ? At any rate , if I remain unimpressed by the good Doctor Johnson I confess the problem lies in his definition of patriotism as " the last refuge of a scoundrel " . This is incorrect.I beg to submit it is the first.How many times , and covering a period of how many years , must one 's unexplainable obscurity be pointed out to constitute fame ? Not knowing , I am almost disposed to consider myself the most famous of authors . I have pretty nearly ceased to be " discovered " , but my notoriety as an obscurian sic may be said to be world wide and apparently everlasting.Upon the death of my second son , Leigh , who froze to death during a winter storm after an alcoholic binge , I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you can guess  --  am a bit broken and gone gray of it. I am leading a life of mere waiting  --  waiting for nothing in particular , except the end of it all . I do no work that I care to do  --  just the work that keeps me living  --  for I 've no incentive , no ambition but to go on with as little friction as possible . ( Why did not God make us with ball-bearings ? ) President Theodore Roosevelt , a man I despised for his mediocrity and war mongering , invited me to the White House . I declined on the grounds that I never neglect old friends to make new.This delighted Roosevelt who promptly wrote to me : I quite agree with you . Come to-night , and let us be old friends.What could I do ? After all , he was the President.Presidency , noun . The greased pig in the field game of American politics.Things went well enough till after dinner . The President showed me the famous picture of San Juan Hill . When asked what I thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mister President , at San Juan when in truth you were not there.Hearst got it into his head to sponsor a debate at a New York hotel between two socialists , Morris Hilquitt and John Hunter  --  and myself . Hunter had just published a book called POVERTY and opened the discussion with statistics . I challenged the statistics , as I would challenge all organized lies , lies organized by whatever mechanical system . But all agreed a great deal of poverty existed . Socialism was proposed as a solution.I said : I do n't see that there is any remedy for a condition which consists in the rich being on top , or rather the strongest being on top . They always will be.Now do n't understand me as defending that system , and I am referring to the evils of unregulated industrialism . I wish I could abolish it . I only say it is inevitable and incurable . Nothing touches me more than poverty ; I have been poor myself.In this country every man has a vote . If he is not satisfied with conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If the working man and the poor are in the majority , why do n't they get together ? Because they have n't sense enough . They can have any laws or system they want.The poor do not have a monopoly on all the virtues.The general idea among the sons of discontent is that the prosperous are dishonest and the unprosperous are honest . If that is so , abolition of poverty is a nefarious business.I do n't believe in the greatest good to the greatest number  --  it seems to me perfect rot . I do believe in the greatest good to the best . And I would sacrifice a thousand incapable men to elevate one really good person.Hunter said : And a dictator will bring revolution.I said : Sure.He said : The people alone are unconquerable.The people , I replied , are always doing silly things . They sail in and out of great affairs , and shed a lot of blood and they are back where they were before.He said : You think civilization has not accomplished anything in recent years . ( He was smiling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished everything , I said , but it has not made humanity any happier . Happiness is the only thing worth having . I find happiness in looking at poor men in the same way I do in looking at the ants in an anthill . And I find happiness in looking at the capitalist . I do n't care what he does , nor what the others do . It pleases me to look at them . Each man is concerned with his own happiness . Nothing matters , do n't you see ? Hey , some of my best friends are socialists.I have a socialist friend , a writer by the name of Jack London . Some one alleged to him , incorrectly , that I had said something not flattering about his work . London replied , For heaven 's sake do n't quarrel with Ambrose about me . He crystallized before you and I were born ; and it is a magnificent crystallization.He stopped growing a generation ago . Of course he keeps up with the newspapers , but his criteria crystallized thirty odd years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been born a socialist , and more likely an anarchist . He never reads books that are n't a hundred years old , and he glories in the fact.Me , a socialist ! Or an ANARCHIST ! Can you imagine it ? I can't.As for Hearst , when I think of him now I see him : Silent and smiling , he moves among men , the loneliest man . Nobody but god loves him , and he knows it ; and god 's love he values only in so far as he fancies that it may promote his amusing ambition to darken the door of the White House . As to that I think he would be the kind of President that this country  --  daft with democracy and sick with sin  --  is beginning to deserve.I am sure it must be wrong for whole nations to be wicked . But in this worst of all possible worlds it does seem as if ethical considerations had no more weight than that to which their beauty entitles them .
