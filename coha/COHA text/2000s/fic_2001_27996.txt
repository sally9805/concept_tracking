Washington , D.C. Five weeks later The patient was conveyed by a chartered jet to a private landing strip twenty miles northwest of Washington , D.C. Although the patient was the only passenger on the entire aircraft , no one spoke to him except to ascertain his immediate needs . No one knew his name . All they knew was that this was clearly an extremely important passenger . The flight 's arrival appeared on no aviation logs anywhere , military or civilian . The nameless passenger was then taken by unmarked sedan to downtown Washington and dropped off , at his own request , near a parking garage in the middle of an unremarkable block near Dupont Circle . He wore an unimpressive gray suit with a pair of tasseled cordovan loafers that had been scuffed and shined a few too many times , and looked like one of a thousand midlevel lobbyists and bureaucrats , the faceless , colorless staffers of a permanent Washington . Nobody gave him a second look as he emerged from the parking garage , then walked , stiffly and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1324 K Street , near Twenty-first . The building , all cement and gray-tinted glass , was scarcely distinguishable from all the other bland , boxy low-rises along this stretch of northwest Washington . These were the offices , invariably , of lobbying groups and trade organizations , travel bureaus and industry boards . Beside its front entrance a couple of brass plaques were mounted , announcing the offices of INNOVATION ENTERPRISES and AMERICAN TRADE INTERNATIONAL . Only a trained engineer withhighly rarefied expertise might have noticed a few anomalous detailsthe fact , for example , that every window frame was equipped with a piezoelectric oscillator , rendering futile any attempt at laser-acoustic surveillance from outside . Or the high-frequency white-noise " drench " that enveloped the building in a cone of radio waves , sufficient to defeat most forms of electronic eavesdropping . Certainly nothing ever attracted the attention of its K Street neighborsthe balding lawyers at the grains board , the grim-faced accountants in their ties and short-sleeved shirts at the slowly failing business consulting firm . People arrived at 1324 K Street in the morning and left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the appropriate days . What else did anybody care to know ? But that was how the Directorate liked to be : hidden in plain view . The man almost smiled to himself when he thought about it . For who would ever suspect that the most secretive of the world 's covert agencies would be headquartered in an ordinary-looking office building in the middle of K Street , right out in the open ? The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley , Virginia , and the National Security Agency in Fort Meade , Maryland , were housed in moated fortresses that proclaimed their existence ! Here I am , they seemed to say , right here , pay no attention to me ! They virtually dared their opponents to breach their securityas inevitably happened . The Directorate made those so-called clandestine bureaucracies look about as reclusive as the U.S. Postal Service . The man stood inside the lobby of 1324 K Street and scanned the sleek brass panel , on which was mounted a perfectly conventional-looking telephone handset beneath a dial pad , from all appearances the sort of arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man picked up the handset and then pressed a series of numbers , a predetermined code . He kept his index finger pressed on the last button , the # sign , for a few seconds until he heard a faint ring , signifying that his fingerprint had been electronically scanned , analyzed , matched against a preexisting and precleared database of digitized fingerprints , and approved . Then he listened to the telephone handset as it rang precisely three times . A disembodied , mechanical female voice commanded him to state his business . " I have an appointment with Mr. Mackenzie , " said the man . In a matter of seconds his words were converted into bits of data and matched against another database of precleared voiceprints . Only then did a faint buzzing in the lobby indicate that the first inner set of glass doors could be opened . He hung up the telephone receiver and pushed open the heavy , bulletproof glass doors , entered a tiny antechamber , and stood there for a few seconds ; as his facial features were scanned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized patterns . The second set of doors opened onto a small , featureless reception area of white walls and gray industrial carpeting , equipped with hidden monitoring devices that could detect all manner of concealed weapons . On a marble-topped console in one corner , there was a stack of pamphlets emblazoned with the logo of American Trade International , an organization that existed only as a set of legal documents and registrations . The rest of the pamphlets were given over to an unreadable mission statement , filled with platitudes about international trade . An unsmiling guard waved Bryson past , through another set of doors and into a handsomely appointed hall , paneled in dark , buried walnut , where about a dozen clerical types were at their desks . It might have been an upscale art gallery of the sort one might find on Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan , or perhaps a prosperous law firm . " Nick Bryson , my main man ! " exclaimed Chris Edgecomb , bounding from his seat at a computer monitor . Born in Guyana , he was a lithe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been at the Directorate for four years , working on the **31;175;TOOLONG team ; he fielded distress calls , figured out ways to relay information to agents in the field when it was necessary . Edgecomb clasped Bryson 's hand warmly . Nicholas Bryson knew he was something of a hero to people like Edgecomb , who yearned to be field operatives . " Join the Directorate and change the world , " Edgecomb would joke in his lilting English , and it was Bryson he had in mind when he said it . It was a rare event , Bryson knew , that the office staff saw Bryson face-to-face ; for Edgecomb , this was an occasion . " Somebody hurt you ? " Edgecomb 's expression was sympathetic ; he saw a strong man who had been hospitalized until recently . Then he continued hastily , knowing better than to ask questions : " I 'll pray to Saint Christopher for you . You 'll be a hundred percent in no time . " The Directorate 's creed , above all , was segmentation and compartmentalization . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the position to jeopardize the security of the whole . The organizational chart was shrouded even to a veteran like Bryson . He knew a few of the desk jockeys , of course . But the field personnel all operated in isolation , through their own proprietary networks . If you had to work together , you knew each other only by a field legend , a temporary alias . The rule was more than procedure , it was Holy Writ . " You 're a good man , Chris , " Bryson remarked . Edgecomb smiled modestly , then pointed a finger upward . He knew Bryson had an appointmentor was it a summons ? with the big man himself , Ted Waller . Bryson smiled , gave Edgecomb a friendly clap on the shoulder , and made his way to the elevator . " Do n't get up , " Bryson said heartily as he entered Ted Waller 's third-floor office . Waller did anyway , all six feet , four inches and three hundred pounds of him . " Good Lord , look at you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You look like you came out of a POW camp . " " Thirty-three days in a U.S. government clinic in Morocco will do that to you , " Bryson said . " It 's not exactly the Ritz . " " Perhaps I should try being gutted by a mad terrorist someday . " Waller patted his ample girth . He was even larger than the last time Bryson had seen him , though his avoirdupois was elegantly sheathed in a suit of navy cashmere , his bull neck flattered by the spread collar of one of his Turnbull &; Asser shirts . " Nick , I 've been tormenting myself since this happened . It was a serrated Verenski blade from Bulgaria , I 'm told . Plunge and twist . Terribly low-tech , but it usually does the job . What a business we 're in . Never forget , it 's what you do n't see that always gets you . " Waller settled weightily back in the tufted-leather chair behind his oak desk . The early-afternoon sun filtered through the polarized glass behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccustomed formality . Waller , who was normally ruddy and seemingly robust , now looked pallid , the circles under his eyes deep . " They say you 've made a remarkable recovery . " " In a few more weeks , I 'll be as good as new . At least that 's what the doctors tell me . They also say I 'll never need an appendectomy , a side benefit I never thought of . " As he spoke , he felt the dull ache in his lower-right abdomen . Waller nodded distractedly . " You know why you 're here ? " " A kid gets a note to see the principal , he expects a reprimand . " Bryson feigned lightheartedness , but his mood was tense , somber . " A reprimand , " Waller said enigmatically . He was silent for a moment , his eyes settling on a row of leather-bound books on the shelves near the door . Then he turned back and said in a gentle , pained voice : " The Directorate does n't exactly post an organizational chart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . Decisions , particularly ones concerning key personnel , do not always stop at my desk . And as important as loyalty is to you and to mehell , to most of the people in this goddamned placeit 's coldhearted pragmatism that rules the day . You know that . " Bryson had only had one serious job in his life , and this was it ; still , he recognized the undertones of the pink-slip talk . He fought the urge to defend himself , for that was not Directorate procedure ; it was unseemly . He recalled one of Wallet 's mantras : There 's no such thing as bad luck , then thought of another maxim . " All 's well that ends well , " Bryson said . " And it did end well . " " We almost lost you , " Waller said . " I almost lost you , " he added ruefully , a teacher speaking to a prize student who has disappointed him . " That 's not pertinent , " Bryson said quietly . " Anyway , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in the field ; you know that . You taught me that . You improvise , you follow instinctnot just established protocol . " " Losing you could have meant losing Tunisia . There 's a cascade effect : when we intervene , we do so early enough to make a difference . Actions are carefully titrated , reactions calibrated , variables accounted for . And so you nearly compromised quite a few other undercover operations , in Maghreb and other places around the sandbox . You put other lives in jeopardy , Nickyother operations and other lives . The Technician 's legend was intricately connected to other legends we 'd manufactured ; you know that . Yet you let your cover get blown . Years of undercover work compromised because of you ! " " Now , wait a second " " Giving them defective munitions'how did you think they would n't suspect you ? " " Damn it , they were n't supposed to be defective ! " " But they were . Why ? " " I do n't know ! " " Did you inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . It never crossed my mind that the goods were n't as they were represented . " " That was a serious lapse , Nicky . You endangered years of work , years of deep-cover planning , cultivation of valuable assets . The lives of some of our most valuable assets ! Goddamn it , what were you thinking ? " Bryson was silent for a moment . " I was set up , " he said at last . " Set up how ? " " I ca n't say for sure . " " If you were set up , ' that means you were already under suspicion , correct ? " " II do n't know . " " I do n't know ' ? Not exactly words that inspire confidence , are they ? They 're not words I like to hear . You used to be our top field operative . What happened to you , Nick ? " " MaybesomehowI screwed up . Do n't you think I 've gone over it and over it in my mind ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't any answersnot now , not yet . " " We ca n't afford such screwups . We ca n't tolerate this kind of carelessness . None of us can . We allow for margins of error . But we can not go beyond them . The Directorate does n't tolerate mistakes . You 've known that since day one . " " You think there was something I could have done differently ? Or maybe you think somebody else could have done it better ? " " You were the best we ever had , you know that . But as I told you , these decisions are reached at consortium level , not at my desk . " A chill ran through Bryson upon hearing the bureaucratese that told him Waller had already distanced himself from the consequences of the decision to let him go . Ted Waller was Bryson 's mentor , boss , and friend , and , fifteen years ago , his teacher . He had supervised his apprenticeship , briefed him personally before the operations he worked on early in his career . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day . Waller was the most brilliant man he 'd ever met . He could solve partial differential equations in his head ; he possessed vast stores of arcane geopolitical knowledge . At the same time his lumbering frame belied his extraordinary physical dexterity . Bryson recalled him at a shooting range , absently hitting one bull's-eye after another from seventy feet while chatting about the sad decline of British bespoke tailoring . The .22 looked puny in his large , plump , soft hand ; it was so under his control that it might have been another finger . " You used the past tense , Ted , " Bryson said . " The implication being that you believe I 've lost it . " " I simply meant what I said , " Waller replied quietly . " I 've never worked with anyone better , and I doubt I ever will . " By temperament and by training , Nick knew how to remain impassive , but now his heart was thudding . You were the best we ever had , Nick . That sounded like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key element of the ritual of separation . Bryson would never forget Waller 's reaction when he pulled off his first operational hat trickfoiling the assassination of a moderate reform candidate in South America . It was a taciturn Not bad : Waller had pressed his lips together to keep from smiling , and to Nick , it was a greater accolade than any that followed . It 's when they begin to acknowledge how valuable you are , Bryson had learned , that you know they 're putting you out to pasture . " Nick , nobody else could have accomplished what you did in the Comoros . The place would have been in the hands of that madman , Colonel Denard . In Sri Lanka , there are probably thousands of people who are alive , on both sides , because of the arms-trading routes you exposed . And what you did in Belarus ? The GRU still does n't have a clue , and they never will . Leave it to the politicians to color inside the lines , because those are the lines that we 've drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , and the truth is , it 's better that way . But we know that , do n't we ? " Bryson did n't reply ; no reply was called for . " And on a separate matter , Nick , noses are out of joint around here about the Banque du Nord business . " He was referring to Bryson 's penetration of a Tunis bank that channeled laundered funds to Abu and Hezbollah to fund the coup attempt . One night during the operation more than 1.5 billion dollars simply disappeared , vanished into cyberspace . Months of investigation had failed to account for the missing assets . It was a loose end , and the Directorate disliked loose ends . " You 're not suggesting that I had my hand in the cookie jar , are you ? " " Of course not . But you understand that there are always going to be suspicions . When there are no answers , the questions linger ; you know that . " " I 've had plenty of opportunities for personal enrichment ' that would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been tested , yes , and you 've passed with flying colors . But I question the method of diversion , the monies transferred through false flags to Abu 's colleagues to purchase compromisable background data . " " That 's called improvisation . It 's what you pay me forusing my powers of discretion when and where necessary . " Bryson stopped , realizing something . " But I was never debriefed about this ! " " You offered up the details yourself , Nick , " said Waller . " I sure as hell neveroh , Christ , it was chemicals , was n't it ? " Waller hesitated a split-second , but just long enough that Bryson 's question was answered . Ted Waller could lie , blithely and easily , when the need dictated , but Bryson knew his old friend and mentor found lying to him distasteful . " Where we obtain our information is compartmented , Nick . You know that . " Now he understood the need for such a protracted stay in an American-staffed clinic in Laayoune . Chemicals had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the intravenous drip . " Goddamn it , Ted ! What 's the implicationthat I could n't be trusted to undergo a conventional debriefing , offer the goods up freely ? That only a blind interrogation could tell you what you wanted to know ? You had to put me under without my knowledge ? " " Sometimes the most reliable interrogation is that which is conducted without the subject 's calculation of his own best interest . " " Meaning you guys thought that I 'd lie to cover my ass ? " Waller 's reply was quiet , chilling . " Once assessments are made that an individual is not one hundred percent trustworthy , contrary assumptions are made , at least provisionally . You detest it , and I detest it , but that 's the brutal fact of an intelligence bureaucracy . Particularly one as reclusivemaybe paranoid is the more accurate word hereas we are . " Paranoid . In fact , Bryson had learned long ago that to Waller and his colleagues at the Directorate , it was an article of faith that the Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Security Agency were riddled with moles , hamstrung by regulation , and mired in an arms race of disinformation with their hostile counterparts abroad . Waller liked to call these , the agencies whose existence was emblazoned on Congressional appropriations bills and organization charts , the " woolly mammoths . " In his earliest days with the Directorate , Bryson had innocently asked whether some measure of cooperation with the other agencies did n't make sense . Waller had laughed . " You mean , let the woolly mammoths know we exist ? Why not just send a press release to Pravda ? " But the crisis of American intelligence , in Waller 's view , went far beyond the problems of penetration . Counterintelligence was the true wilderness of mirrors . " You lie to your enemy , and then you spy on them , " Waller had once pointed out , " and what you learn is the lie . Only now , somehow , the lie has become true , because it 's been recategorized as intelligence . ' It 's like an Easter-egg hunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have painstakingly unearthed eggs that their colleagues have just as painstakingly buried ? Colorful , beautifully painted Easter eggsbut fakes nonetheless . " The two had sat talking through the night in the below-ground library underneath the K Street headquarters , a chamber furnished with seventeenth-century Kurdish rugs on the floor , old British oil paintings of the hunt , of loyal dogs grasping fowl in their pedigreed mouths . " You see the genius of it ? " Waller had gone on . " Every CIA adventure , botched or otherwise , will eventually come under public scrutiny . Not so for us , simply because we 're on nobody 's radar . " Bryson still remembered the soft rattle of ice cubes in the heavy crystal glass as Waller took a sip of the barrel-proof bourbon he favored . " But operating off the grid , practically like outlaws , ca n't exactly be the most practical way to do business , " Bryson had protested . " For one thing , there 's the matter of resources . " " Granted , we do n't have the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , the constraints . All in all , it 's a positive advantage , given our particular purview . Our record is proof of it . When you work in ad hoc fashion with groups around the world , when you do n't shy from extremely aggressive interventions , then all you need is a very small number of highly trained operatives . You take advantage of on-the-ground forces . You succeed by directing events , coordinating the desired outcomes . You do n't need the vast overheads of the spy bureaucracies . All you really need is brains . " " And blood , " said Bryson , who had already seen his share of it by then . " Blood . " Waller had shrugged . " That great monster Joseph Stalin once put it quite aptly : you ca n't make an omelet without breaking some eggs . " He spoke about the American century , about the burdens of empire . About imperial Britain in the nineteenth century , when Parliament would debate for six months about whether to send an expeditionary force to rescue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waller and his colleagues at the Directorate believed in liberal democracy , fervently and unequivocallybut they also knew that to secure its future , you could n't play , as Waller liked to say , by Queensbury rules . If your enemies operated by low cunning , you 'd better summon up some good old low cunning of your own . " We 're the necessary evil , " Waller had told him . " But do n't ever get cockythe noun is evil . We 're extra-legal . Unsupervised , unregulated . Sometimes I do n't even feel safe knowing that we 're around . " There was another soft rattle of ice cubes as he drained the last drops of bourbon from the glass . Nick Bryson had known fanaticsfriendlies and hostiles bothand he found comfort in Waller 's very ambivalence . Bryson had never felt he 'd fully had the measure of Waller 's mind : the brilliance , the cynicism , but mostly the intense , almost bashful idealism , like sunlight spilling through the edge of drawn blinds . " My friend , " Waller said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wo n't be necessary . " ( Continues ... )
