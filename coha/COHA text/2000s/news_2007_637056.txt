<p> Columbus , Ohio  --  There were five minutes left in the final regular-season hoedown between Ohio State and Wisconsin . Bumped and clutched by just about every cheesehead this side of the late Joe McCarthy , the Buckeyes ' landmark center , Greg Oden , had just been whistled for a travel . <p> His coach was having kittens , in a halfcourt rant that was impressive even by Thad Matta 's high standards . The home crowd turned ever so slightly riotous , some flinging rally towels , just as far as terrycloth could carry , in the direction of anyone in stripes . <p> Amid it all there was the 7-foot , 19-year-old Oden , perfectly placid , a freshman behaving as the most adult person in the building . In absolute control . <p> He thinks it 's the thick beard , the reason everyone looks at this freshman and sees a fully vested steelworker . <p> " It 's mostly the beard , " he says . " When I can grow it  --  it takes like three weeks to grow in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took so much time I do n't want to cut it off right away . " <p> And you thought he could go from clean-shaven to survivalist in an afternoon . <p> But it 's more . It 's the sad , almost weary expression in his eyes . It 's a strong face that a designer would call distressed . It 's the composure , a bearing that should only come with hard experience . <p> That is the great deception of the most intriguing figure on the nation 's No. 1-ranked college team , and certainly a leading lightning rod now that the NCAA tournament is upon us . Greg Oden is not fully grown . <p> " I feel like a freshman . I do n't feel like I 'm older or better than anybody else , " he said . <p> Among the many things that Oden has yet to learn about being a sure-fire basketball star is the attitude . During a brief interview session in late April , he kept referring to his questioner as " Sir " instead of emitting a celebrity 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oden has been half again bigger and stronger than anyone else on the floor with him . By the time he was buying his Trapper Keeper to start the 11th grade , he was being told he was a certain No. 1 NBA draft pick as that rarest of commodity  --  the true center . He is the presence that must always be accounted for . <p> Coaches ever since have been rushing to their Roget 's to find some new way to praise the giant . <p> " A 7-foot Bill Russell "  --  Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl . <p> " One of the greatest prospects in the 30 years or however long I 've done this stuff "  --  North Carolina coach Roy Williams . <p> And yet , there Oden stands again , pretty much unmoved . It is generally assumed the only reason Oden is at Ohio State is because of the NBA 's new age rule . But with the way he seems able to take a long , objective look at himself , Oden may have opted for the college life regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college , " he still insists . " I felt game-wise I was n't ready . I know as a young man I 'm not ready yet to be out in the real world . When I 'm here , I 'm going to class . Take that , Bobby Knight . His is not a heavy load , though , with classes this semester reportedly in sociology and the history of rock ' n'roll . <p> " I 'm going to everything . When that time comes to make that decision about the NBA , then I 'll make it . " <p> In the company of select other freshmen dramatically elevating their teams , Oden is strikingly candid about his place among them . He witnessed North Carolina 's Brandan Wright stepping up at the end to help beat Ohio State early in the season . He sees in Texas ' flamboyant Kevin Durant a player more along the modern template of a professional . <p> " I know I 'm not NBA ready , " he said . " Take as an example Kevin Durant , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are  --  scorers . I know you have a Ben Wallace who is a defender , but more than 90 percent of the guys are scorers . I know I 'm not that type of scorer yet . I know I 'm a defender . I knew college would help me with my offensive game . " <p> Oden stands as Ohio State 's leading scorer ( 15.5 points per game ) , rebounder ( 9.7 ) and blocked shot specialist ( 92 in 26 games ) . At the same time , it 's not exactly like he has laid waste to the college game , as expected of a 7-foot , 280-pound marvel . Against some of the very best teams , he has been less than spectacular . He missed North Carolina , still recovering from an injured wrist . He blamed himself for being too passive in the season 's first game against Wisconsin , and has managed a total of 33 points and 22 rebounds in three games with the Badgers . Against Florida , he had a quiet seven points and six rebounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time , presumably , to leave his mark on college basketball . <p> While operating at about 80 percent by his own estimate , still shooting free throws with his off ( left ) hand because of the recovering wrist , Oden is very much at the center of the Buckeyes ' push for a championship . The one enduring controversy around this young , talented bunch is the question of Oden 's touches . The popular opinion being : Just dump the ball inside every time and let natural selection take its course . The biggest man always scores , right ? <p> " Who would n't like to get the ball more ? " he asks . " But I understand that I am getting double- and triple-teamed and it 's hard to get it in there . So , all I have to do is keep on working , keep on talking to my guys to get me the ball when I am one-on-one or when I can get an angle to go through a double-team . " <p> Then , of course , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA legal . Every rational argument centers on making a whole lot of money as soon as possible , maximizing every earning opportunity . But Oden is just different enough to leave ' em wondering . <p> As his mother , Zoe , told the Columbus ( Ohio ) Dispatch , underscoring her son 's low-key ways , " He wants to be normal like everyone else . He does n't want to be thought of as a freak . If it were up to Greg , he 'd be somewhere in the corner , hiding . He does n't really like to stand out . " <p> Oden 's favorite diversion is to sit in a dark movie theater , letting someone else 's images wash over him . <p> " I think it 's incredible how he 's handled all the notoriety that has come to him , " Matta said . " It 's been going on for four years with him . He 's still a very humble kid , a very passionate kid . " <p> Shortly after the Buckeyes had dispatched Wisconsin in their final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this could be Oden 's goodbye to Columbus . " One more year ! One more year ! " they chanted toward Oden , all but on bended knee . <p> " So was I , " laughed Matta . <p> Zoe Oden put her index finger to her lips , joking with the crowd to keep that quiet . And her son still stood quietly amid the celebration and the expectation and the pleading , a good foot above it all . <p> THEY MIGHT BE HAWKS <p> None of them has said whether he 'll enter the NBA draft , but here 's a look at five prospects the Hawks ' brass will surely be paying extra close attention to during the NCAA tournament : <p> * Kevin Durant , forward , Texas : Freshman 's offensive prowess is unmatched in this or either of the previous two drafts . <p> * Al Horford , forward , Florida : His inside game is more NBA-ready than any other player on this list . <p> * Joakim Noah , forward , Florida : Not advanced offensively , but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oden , center , Ohio State : No player in the tournament fills the Hawks ' biggest need more than the 7-footer . <p> * Brandan Wright , forward , North Carolina : Unlimited potential , but would be a bit redundant on Hawks ' roster . <p>  --  Sekou Smith <p> GO TO AJC.COM FOR NCAA TOURNAMENT BRACKETS Photo : JONATHAN DANIEL / Getty ImagesGreg Oden Photo : Nabil K.
