Old Train Corridors Are A Hiker 's Delight // The 19th century railroad station in Chattanooga , Tennessee , has been painstakingly rebuilt - as a hotel . The city is building a sustainable image through such mass-transit services as a free electric bus shuttle , but contrary to the immortal song " Chattanooga Choo Choo , " there 's no passenger rail service anymore . The American rail network , once the envy of the world , has fallen on hard times . At its peak in 1916 , there were 300,000 miles of track , a network six times as big as today 's interstate highway system . According to Stephen B. Goddard 's Getting There : The Epic Struggle Between Road and Rail in the American Century , private investors put $21 billion into railroads that same year . Today , the much-reduced national Amtrak rail network is struggling to get off federal life support . Amtrak is in makeor-break mode , heavily dependent on the success of a new high-speed line , Acela , that is providing 150-mile-per-hour service between Washington and Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national railway service is on a Congressionally mandated " glide path " to financial independence that should end in a total separation by the 2003 fiscal year . Meanwhile , only half of the original rail network is still in place , and railroads continue to abandon 2,000 miles of track every year . Once old rail rights of way , or " corridors , " are sold for development , they 're gone forever . Recreating them is cost-prohibitive . Cities reintroducing light rail do so at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per mile . The nonprofit Rails-to-Trails Conservancy ( RTC ) answers this dilemma by turning unused rail corridors , at least temporarily , into hiking trails . Founder Dave Burwell is an environmental lawyer by trade , and worked in the 1970s for the National Wildlife Federation , which focuses mainly on preserving wildlife habitats for hunting . Abandoned , overgrown train lines provide precisely that kind of animal-friendly habitat , but as railroads deregulated in the Photograph California 's Bizz Johnson Trail was once a busy rail line - and could be again through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . // 1970s , they began selling land for development . And hunters began to lose access to the corridors . Burwell researched the corridors ' history . " I found tht even though they were under railroad control , they had originated in federal and state land grants , " he says . " And so there was considerable public investment in them . The problem was that there was no legal preservation mechanism that kicked in when the railroads divested . The 10 to 20 percent not actually owned by the railroads revert to somebody , but whom ? Title problems almost guaranteed they would n't be saved . " In 1983 , Congress enacted a powerful amendment to the National Trails System Act that allowed soon-to-be-abandoned rail lines to be " railbanked " for possible reactivation . And while the world waits for the resurrection of railroads , the corridors make ideal trails , passing through some mighty picturesque countryside . Most of the work of trail creation has already been hL done by the railroad . The Rails-to-Trails program has been a fantastic success . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail mileage of more than 11,000 . Another 1,200 projects are underway in all 50 states , with 18,000 more miles . There 's unlimited potential , givent the fact that more than 160,000 miles of rail corridor have been abandoned . " But some of it has been converted to roads , some plowed up for farm land , " says Burwell . " We 'd be happy with a third of the total , 50,000 miles of trails opened up to public use . " RTC has researched a possible rail trail across the continent , starting from either Massachusetts or Maryland and ending up in Seattle or San Francisco . Some 30 percent of the route already exists , another 35 percent is in public ownership , and the remaining 35 percent , now private , would take massive amounts of work to put together . It 's a splendid ambition , though . If the whole network is connected , there will be off-road trails and greenways from coast to coast . A prime example of a successful corridor is the Katy Trail , a 200-mile pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularly known as the Katy . The famous train is featured in an old blues tune that laments , " She caught the Katy/And left me the mule to ride . " The Katy was decommissioned in 1986 and its iron rails and wooden ties sold for scrap . The corridor was acquired by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources , which turned it into a state park . The Union Pacific Railroad donated another 33 miles of disused track in 1991 . Though it runs through patches of meadow , for the most part the trail is shaded by a canopy of mature second-growth trees , and it 's a cool haven on hot days . As the trail winds by the Missouri River near the University of Missouri campus , the farms on either side provide a nostalgic look at what that part of the state was like before Columbia became a sprawling college town . But creating beautiful hiking trails is only part of what RTC is about . It 's also very serious about its role as a railbank . " Rail buffs are suspicious of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid they 'll never get their corridors back for rail use . But if we were n't preserving them with trails , they 'd be gone forever . " Hank Dittmar , formerly the director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project , now runs the Great American Station Foundation , which seeks to renovate the old buildings as cornerstones of downtown revitalization . " Not all the corridors will ever be viable for conversion back to commuter rail , " Dittmar says , " but that has to be an option . The best thing is to make sure that you can do rails with trails . " Dittmar points out that the conversion issue has never been tested , because no railroad has ever tried to claim a rail trail . " But there has to be the clear intention that it can be returned , " he says . " The existence of rail trails needs to be factored into the regional planning process , and every possible use considered for them . " Ross Capon , executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers , is similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . But , he adds , " It sure beats putting a building down in the middle of a right of way or letting it sit there and grow weeds . " <p>
