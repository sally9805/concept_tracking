Elephant " single moms " are struggling to recreate family life after the traumatic years of poaching. // There-a baby ! She is coming to us by the river , " Patrick Mwamba , a Bemba tribesman , whispered . Across the river from our camp a small female elephant trotted along the shore , her trunk flopping loosely like a garden hose . Abruptly , she stopped and looked into the tall grass , then turned and walked slowly south . Holding her little trunk in the air like a periscope , she twisted the end around in all directions . As we watched her , Patrick whispered what each of us was thinking : " She is very much alone in this place . " Another orphan . They had become commonplace here , in North Luangwa National Park ( NLNP ) , Zambia . From the late 1970s through the 1980s , commercial poachers had shot 93 percent of the elephants in the population for their ivory , skin , or meat . The population had declined from 17,000 in the mid-1970s to approximately 1,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the middle of this devastating period , the Zambian government simply did not have the resources to stem the onslaught . Part of the problem was the park 's remote wilderness . It is nestled under the shoulder of the Muchinga Escarpment , where waterfalls tumble a thousand feet over forested mountains see map on opposite page . To the east of the mountains , the wide Luangwa River snakes its way through a valley , creating enormous floodplains and habitat for Cape buffalo , Cookson 's wildebeest , puku antelope , and zebras . In 1986 , gliding over the plains for the first time and peering down from our small airplane , we saw a landscape that looked wild and free . In fact , though , poachers had taken it over . Bands of as many as a hundred men had set up makeshift encampinents , from which they would sally forth to shoot elephants and lions . Then , like scurrying ants , they would carry the illegal ivory and meat over the escarpment , where it was sold to smugglers . For more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant products have made hunting and poaching ongoing facts of life for elephants , both in Africa and in Asia . The easiest way to get the ivory has always been to kill the giant creatures , and as firearms have become more common , more accurate , and more deadly in the past two centuries , more elephants have been killed . The elephants of Luangwa were , to some extent , protected by their remote location and by the ruggedness of the terrain . In the early years of the ivory trade they had fewer losses than did elephants in other , more densely human-inhabited areas , such as South Africa . But by the late 1970s , intense poaching finally reached NLNP . There were still 5,000 elephants in the park when we arrived in 1986 , but the poachers were shooting about a thousand every year . Working with the Zambian National Parks and Wildlife Services and the Anticorruption Commission , we assisted government game scouts by providing housing , trucks , uniforms , and food for their patrols . With new training and incentives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fourteen outlying villages we set up the North Luangwa Conservation Project ( NLCP ) , which offered alternative jobs , rural health care , and conservation education . Poaching is not only illegal , it is dangerous and not very profitable for the villagers . Ivory smugglers paid villagers only ten dollars for shooting an elephant . With the village jobs program in place , many of the former poachers and other villagers became beekeepers , fish farmers , millers , or sunflower-press operators . Men and women had safe , profitable jobs that fed and supported their families . Another tool that proved essential in the struggle against poaching was the international ivory ban , adopted in 1989 . Smugglers could no longer make large sums of money from ivory , so they could no longer afford to hire villagers to be shooters or porters . Finally the poaching declined to fewer than ten elephants killed in 1991 , and even fewer per year in the next decade . Still , a few elephants were being shot . The entire family of the orphan that Patrick spotted had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to our camp . Patrick and the two of us watched as she slowly dropped her trunk , walked into the tall grass , and disappeared . We crossed the shallow river , keeping an eye out for Ripples , a crocodile that frequented the pools and eddies near camp . We studied the footprints the little elephant had left in the white-hot sand . African elephants grow throughout their lives , so one can estimate their ages by measuring the length of their hind footprints . The method is particularly accurate up to fifteen years of age , and so we were fairly certain from our measurements that the orphan was about five years old . We named her Gift ; we did n't expect to see her again . African elephants usually live in tight social groups-in fact , family units-whose gene lines persist for generations . Females remain within the group throughout their lives , and each family unit is led by a matriarch that , in the days before widespread poaching , could live to be sixty years old . Grandmothers , mothers , aunts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers , and play on the plains . There is a lot of touching and bumping of body parts , and the animals , like affectionate tanks , show very little aggression toward each other . Young males stay in the group into which they were born until they reach puberty ( nine to fourteen years of age ) . Since they are related to every female in their natal family unit , when testosterone kicks in , they leave the security of the unit in search of a suitable mate . Adult males spend much of their time alone , or with several other males that stay together while feeding . When a receptive female comes along , however , it 's every bull for himself . Young females learn a great deal about maternal behavior from their elders . Long before they are old enough to reproduce or lactate , female adolescents " practice " the art of nursing infants by putting one forefoot forward ; for a mother and her calf , that movement gives the calf easier access to its mother 's teats . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its aid-pulling it out of the mud , pushing it up an embankment . The old matriarchs are the group 's storehouses of knowledge . They know the water sources in times of drought , the ancient routes across the mountains for the best dry-season forage . They lead the other elephants across the Luangwa River in darkness to avoid the poachers . The matriarch 's guidance is the glue that holds the elephant family together , making it among the most social and cooperative groups of animals on Earth . But little Gift was alone . She was obviously weaned or she would not have survived , but she had no family members to touch her , to lead her , or teach her the ways of the elephant world . The next day Camp Group-a loose alliance of males that often visited our camp to eat the crab-apple-like marula fruit-wandered across the river and fed on the tall grass by our cottage . Forty yards behind them was the diminutive Gift . Abandoning all normal elephant behavior in the absence of a female family , Gift had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day we could see her feeding near them . Now and then Gift would walk up to Survivor , the first male to accept our presence after poaching was reduced , or to Long Tail , another male in Camp Group , whose tail was so long it almost touched the ground . She would hold up her toy-size trunk to theirs in greeting . But the males ignored her ; after all , she was much too young for breeding . In our experience , females did not ovulate before the age of eleven , and usually not until age fourteen . They never gave birth before age sixteen . Gift was only five . So instead of reaching out a trunk or bumping foreheads , as her mother or aunts would have done to Gift , the males turned their backs to her . For ten years we studied the effects of the severe poaching on the NLNP elephant population . We fitted radio collars on one female in each of sixteen family units , and measured the footprints of most of the remaining elephants , thereby determining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of poaching we documented was that by the 1990s , 38 percent of the NLNP elephants were tuskless . In elephant populations where poaching had not been a problem , approximately 2 percent of elephants had no tusks . Because poachers had obviously selected individuals for their tusks , the percentage of the elephants remaining without tusks had greatly increased . But it was not just the number of elephants or the presence of tusks that had changed with poaching . Their very social structure was being transformed . The average size of the family unit had been cut almost in half : from eight individuals to only five . The age structure had also been heavily skewed : only 6 percent of the population was older than twenty . Before the most recent fifteen-year stretch of severe poaching , more than half the elephants in a neighboring population had been older than twenty . In fact , females between twenty and forty-five years old had been the most reproductively active members of populations in which poaching was not severe . Now very few females in that age group in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise old matriarchs leading the family units . A third of the units included no adult female older than fifteen years . Eight percent of the groups were made up entirely of orphans . Young males , which , in an undisturbed elephant society , would still be living in their mothers ' groups , formed groups of their own . They reminded us of inner-city gangs , chasing nonreceptive females and fighting among themselves . The NLNP elephant population had essentially been reduced to groups of teenagers . But the makeup of the groups also posed a mystery . Many of the family units had more infants than adult females . Elephants do not normally adopt orphans , so how was such a shift possible ? It would take us years to unravel that question . Almost three years after we first saw Gift , Patrick Mwamba walked softly to our cottage and knocked on the door . " Come see , " he said . " The baby elephant , the one you call " Giftee , " has got a baby . " " What ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half years old . She was only half the age at which females usually gave birth . But sure enough , we found Gift with a small , dark-gray infant at her side . At first we thought it might be another orphan , clearly too small to survive on its own , but looking to Gift for security . But we soon saw the little female nursing and knew for sure that it was Gift 's daughter . We named her Georgia . At eight and a half , Gift had become a single mom . Single moms are almost unheard of in normal elephant populations . Before the severe poaching in Luangwa , family units of two elephants made up only 3 percent of the total . But our data told us that now one-quarter of the elephant families in North Luangwa were made up of just a single mother and her first calf . Of course , the infants born to single moms were not surrounded by grandmothers , aunts , female cousins , and sisters . Investigators in East Africa have determined that in normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female relatives other than the mother-greatly enhances the survival of a calf . Other females of the family group even help remove the birth sac from newborns . But Georgia had no one but Gift . What was most amazing to us , however , was that Gift had given birth at such a young age . We thought that perhaps she was a fluke . Because she was an orphan , and because she hung out with males all the time , never with adult females , she had become pregnant against all odds . But at least it gave us a good opportunity to observe the maternal behavior of an orphan . By that time , Gift had accepted us completely , and so Georgia did , too . Her newborn wobbling at her heels , Gift walked down the paths in our camp ; they looked more like two small sisters than mother and offspring . Gift was not a good mother . For one thing , of course , she was very young . But since she had not been raised in a family unit , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care that are part of normal elephant social life . Gift rarely reached her trunk to her calf , and sometimes hardly seemed to notice her . In the first weeks of life , a calf stays close to its mother , sometimes leaning against her large leg as if it were a tree trunk . When it is a few months old , it begins to explore farther away , but if it strays too far , the mother or another female will follow it . Not so with Gift and Georgia . One morning when Gift was feeding on marula fruits in camp , Georgia , now about three months old , wandered away from her mother . Gift walked quickly and silently in the opposite direction , toward some large marula trees about forty yards away . Moving her trunk along the ground like a vacuum cleaner , she searched for fruits until she was out of sight of her calf . Suddenly Georgia looked up and could not see her mother . Squealing loudly she dashed around camp , her little legs pumping and her trunk wriggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few seconds , and then ran toward the office cottage in the opposite direction from her mother . We backed up so that we could see Gift . The young mother continued to feed on marula fruits , completely ignoring the shrill cries of her calf . We fought the urge to chase Georgia toward her mother , for fear of making matters worse . Finally , Gift walked into view and Georgia saw her . The calf trotted to her mother 's side , and stayed very near her until they both ambled out of camp several minutes later . Meanwhile NLCP , our project to assist villagers , had grown . We were now offering aid and education to approximately 20,000 Zambians in remote villages near the park . And to our great relief , in 1996 , we recorded no elephants shot in NLNP . But because the North Luangwa elephants had been harassed and killed for so long , many of them were still wary of people . The best way to observe them was from the helicopter purchased by the NLCP . Two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soared over the radio-collared elephants as they moved over the lush plains or riverine forests . We stayed high enough to keep from disturbing them , and monitored the new infants born into each family . We also continued to determine the age of the population by measuring footprints . But we had still not solved the mystery of why each family unit always included more infants than adult females . One morning we watched a young female , about the same age as Gift , suckling a newborn . Mark said into the radio intercom , " That 's it . Gift giving birth so young is not a fluke . The adults are dead , so the adolescents are giving birth ! " We flew a beeline back to camp , and revisited our data . In 70 percent of the family units there were not enough adult females to account for the number of infants . But there were plenty of adolescent females that could have been the mothers . We started making detailed observations of these family units . And , sure enough , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half and fourteen years old were accounting for 48 percent of all births . On their own or in small family units of only two or three elephants , these " teenage " mothers were slowly , haltingly fostering the next generation . They had no old matriarchs to lead them , almost no aunts or female cousins to assist with the squealing infants , no sisters to help protect their offspring . Our aerial counts showed that even though the poaching had stopped , the elephant density was not increasing , possibly on account of high calf mortality and the protracted reproductive cycle . It will probably take many years for the numbers to recover . By the time Gift was sixteen years old-an age when , under normal circumstances , she would have been giving birth to her first calf-she had three calves of her own and one grandcalf . The grandcalf ( Georgia 's calf ) eventually died , but this small family unit , founded by an " ivory orphan , " was making a comeback . Like a single mother in a disrupted human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation without relatives , without culture , without much social support . But she was still making a go of it . The disruption we have seen in elephant social behavior in North Luangwa is mirrored in other populations of African elephants on the continent . They too are facing decreased numbers of matriarchs , the breakdown of family units , and a shift in sex ratio favoring females . But Gift 's abilities as a family leader , which have improved as her family has grown , is her little herd 's foothold on the future , and perhaps the best hope for the return of the great herds of yesterday .
