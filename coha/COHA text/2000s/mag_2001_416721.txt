Women find new shelter from the sex industry // THREE YOUNG WOMEN SIT AT a table sipping coffee in a bright , airy room with windows that expose a glorious spring day in the Macedonian capital of Skopje . Andreea , * 16 , has the high cheekbones , liquid brown eyes , and short bangs reminiscent of her fellow Romanian , Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci . But for Andreea and the two other young women-Mariana , * 18 , from Romania , and Irina , * 17 , from the former Soviet republic of Moldova-the cachet of looking like a celebrity is the last thing on their minds . This spring , the three escaped from the Hotel Slavija in southwestern Macedonia 's resort-filled town of Lake Ohrid , where they had been held as sex workers for the vast seven months by an Albanian  --  Macedonian mobster they knew only as Leku . He is one of the region 's most notorious traffickers of women , a business that Macedonian authorities say is closely linked to narcotics and arms-smuggling rackets . " We waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then we crawled out a window and ran away . " Irina smokes silently as she observes the conversation . When they got to Skopje , a three-hour drive from Lake Ohrid , they went to the Romanian embassy for help . They ended up at a freshly painted , 20-bed transit center , newly opened by the Macedonian government and the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , a Swiss-based group founded after World War II to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants and refugees . Converted from an old school atop Skopje 's towering Aja Pasha hill , the center is the country 's first to provide shelter to undocumented migrants , an important milestone in an increasingly international effort to stem the trafficking of Eastern European women through the Balkans . Although the center is small , the local and international aid workers who lobbied vigorously for it say that because it enables women to testify against traffickers , it could have a profound impact . " If the women want to testify , they can stay at the center for as long as the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asylum and immigration at the Macedonian Ministry of Internal Affairs , under which the center was opened . " Until now , Macedonian police would simply apprehend trafficked women and send them home . " The center provides access to medical care , food , clothing , and legal advice . Like guns , narcotics , and cigarettes , the trafficking of women is a growing business in Macedonia , which sits among the impoverished factory towns of countries in Eastern Europe , just beyond the lure of Western European prosperity . Last year , government authorities detained more than a thousand undocumented migrants a month , the majority of them Eastern European women forced to sell sex in the dozens of bars , motels , and nightclubs that have sprouted up along the highways and in the villages of Macedonia . " Criminal networks are increasingly Photograph The back of a calendar given to soldiers issues a warning about sex trafficking . // using Macedonia as a final destination for trafficked sex workers , " says Martin Wyss , director of the Macedonian office of the IOM . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SLAVERY and 24-HOUR INFO HELPLINE coat the walls . " The same guys running the bars using trafficked women are the same ones running drugs and guns , " Wyss adds . " I 've told Macedonian officials that drugs and guns do n't talk . But women can . " Though the new center helps women testify , traffickers are still going free . It 's a situation that Wyss and Stojkovski are trying to change . The dramatic rise in the number of trafficked women throughout Macedonia coincides with the arrival of some forty-five thousand so-called peacekeeping troops to the region , in the wake of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia two years ago . Kosovo sits about twelve miles north of the Macedonian capital , where many of the NATO-led troops and other international staff come to relax on the weekends . " Interest in the prostitution business went up after the soldiers came to Kosovo , " says Stojkovski . " On the weekends , they flood the brothels in Macedonia . " LSO FUELING THE PROBLEM is the fact that organized crime has become a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added to this are hundreds of ethnic Albanian rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) who fought to liberate the province from Serbian control two years ago . Some of them have now moved into northern Macedonia and are clashing with security forces . The fear is of civil war between Slavs and the ethnic Albanian minority . " You have a group of people who grew accustomed to surviving amongst this chaos by running guns , " says a Western diplomat who asked not to be named . " That environment is starting to change . There is more democratization in the region . But the rebels do n't know how to operate under the rule of law . So they do what they know : smuggle guns , drugs , or women , and fight .

Photograph AT THE TRANSIT CENTER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was forced to work in the sex industry and then imprisoned for using her skills as a midwife to help another sex worker have an abortion . // Wyss says that 1,000 women have escaped from the Macedonian sex industry in the past eight months alone . Like Mariana , Andreea , and Irina , more than 70 percent of these women are between the ages of 15 and 24 , and nearly three percent are under 15 years old . MARIANA AND ANDREEA 'S experience is typical . They were recruited by Valia , a Romanian acquaintance whose last name they did n't know . She offered them jobs as waitresses in a hotel in Italy . After they accepted , they were put in a taxi that took them to Romanias border with Serbia , then told to cross over illegally at night . There , they were picked up and taken to the Belgrade apartment of a Serbian wornan they knew only as Puja . They were given counterfeit Moldovan passports and put on a bus from Belgrade to Skopje , several hours south . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , " says Andreea . " We had no idea what to do . We did n't have any money , and our documents were fake . Someone drove up and asked , Are you from Moldova ? ' We said yes . They said , ' O.K. , let 's go . " ' The teens were driven three hours away to the Hotel Slavija . There they met Leku and his Macedonian partner , Latze . " He beat me to persuade me to have sex with a customer , " says Mariana . When asked who came to the Slavija , Andreea rolls her eyes . " Everyone . Macedonians , Albanians , French , Italian , and German and American KFOR , " ( the acronym for the NATO-led soldiers in Kosovo ) . In response to the boost to the sex industry from NATO soldiers , the IOM now targets them through campaigns , distributing thousands of mini 2001 calendars with a warning message and a hot-line number . Wyss recounts that one German soldier who had been frequenting a brothel in Tetovo gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She called the hot line , the nightclub was raided , and she was released . But Stojkovski says that actually bringing traffickers to justice has been an uphill battle . Bar owners , he says , sometimes bribe police officers , who release them and deport the women who spoke against them . Underpaid border guards and customs officials are also paid to look the other way . Leku is a classic example . The Ministry of Internal Affairs has tried to raid his bars , but the police rarely cooperate . Many Macedonians , including the police , are frightened of men like Leku , who remain tightly connected to arms traffickers and the KLA , as well as a new Macedonian Albanian rebel movement , which regularly clashes with government security forces . Stojkovski says with tensions high , " It 's very dangerous for the police . Some guys are smugglers and some are Albanian fighters . Who knows what a brothel raid will lead to ? " Meanwhile , the women who escape remain ambivalent allies for Stojkovski . As I finished my interview with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wants to go home . The others echoed her sentiments . Would they testify against Leku ? Maybe . But when I call to follow-up , two of the teens had returned home without testifying , and the third is preparing to go . There has been no trial for Leku , and the transit center has eight new women .

Red wine , bare trees , gray river , city of love . Everything that happened there . Now , this . <br> Robin and I flew in to Charles de Gaulle airport on a murky Monday in January . The trip had been my idea of a surprise . I 'd pulled it together in one manic night , booking tickets on Air France and a room at a small hotel on the outskirts of the Eighth arrondissement , packing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego . Showing up at Robin 's room at the Del Coronado just before midnight with a dozen coral roses and a voila ! grin . <br> She came to the door wearing a white T-shirt and a hip-riding red sarong , auburn curls loose , chocolate eyes tired , no makeup . We embraced , then she pulled away and looked down at the suitcase . When I showed her the tickets , she turned her back and shielded me from her tears . Outside her window the night black ocean rolled , but this was no holiday on the beach . She 'd left L.A. because I 'd lied to her and put myself in danger . Listening to her cry now , I wondered if the damage was irreparable . <br> I asked what was wrong . As if I had nothing to do with it . <br> She said , " I 'm just . . . surprised . " <br> We ordered room-service sandwiches , she closed the drapes , we made love . <br> " Paris , " she said , slipping into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . " She sat down , brushed her hair , then stood . Approached the bed , stood over me , touched me . She let the robe slither from her body , straddled me , shut her eyes , lowered a breast to my mouth . When she came the second time , she rolled away , went silent . <br> I played with her hair and , as she fell asleep , the corners of her mouth lifted . Mona Lisa smile . In a couple of days , we 'd be queuing up as robotically as any other tourists , straining for a glimpse of the real thing . <br> She 'd fled to San Diego because a high school chum lived there  --  a thrice-married oral surgeon named Debra Dyer , whose current love interest was a banker from Mexico City . ( " So many white teeth , Alex ! " ) Francisco had suggested a day of shlock-shopping in Tijuana followed by an indeterminate stay at a leased beach house in Cabo San Lucas . Robin , feeling like a fifth wheel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd join her . <br> She 'd been nervous about it . Apologizing for abandoning me . I did n't see it that way , at all . Figured her for the injured party . <br> I 'd gotten myself in a bad situation because of poor planning . Blood had spilled and someone had died . Rationalizing the whole thing was n't that tough : Innocent lives had been at stake , the good guys had won , I 'd ended up on my feet . But as Robin roared away in her truck , I faced the truth : <br> My misadventures had little to do with noble intentions , lots to do with a personality flaw . <br> A long time ago , I 'd chosen clinical psychology , the most sedentary of professions , telling myself that healing emotional wounds was how I wanted to spend the rest of my life . But it had been years since I 'd conducted any long-term therapy . Not because , as I 'd once let myself believe , I 'd burned out on human misery . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gobs of misery . <br> The truth was cold : Once upon a time I had been drawn to the humanity and the challenge of the talking cure , but sitting in the office , dividing hour after hour by three quarters , ingesting other people 's problems , had come to bore me . <br> In a sense , becoming a therapist had been a strange choice . I 'd been a wild boy  --  poor sleeper , restless , overactive , high pain threshold , inclined to risk-taking and injuries . I quieted down a bit when I discovered books but found the classroom a jail and raced through school in order to escape . After graduating high school at sixteen , I bought an old car with summer-job cash , ignored my mother 's tears and my father 's scowling vote of no-confidence , and left the plains of Missouri . Ostensibly for college , but really for the threat and promise of California . <br> Molting like a snake . Needing something new . <br> Novelty had always been my drug . I craved insomnia and menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head , infusions of bad company and the delicious repellence of meeting up with the slimy things that coiled under psychic rocks . A racing heart jolted me happy . The kick start of adrenaline punching my chest made me feel alive . <br> When life slowed down for too long , I grew hollow . <br> But for circumstance , I might 've dealt with it by jumping out of airplanes or scaling bare rocks . Or worse . <br> Years ago , I 'd met a homicide detective and that changed everything . <br> Robin had put up with it for a long time . Now she 'd had enough and , sooner rather than later , I 'd have to make some kind of decision . <br> She loved me . I know she did . <br> Maybe that 's why she made it easy for me . <br> CHAPTER <br> 2 <br> In Paris , clichTs are just fine . You leave your hotel , step out into the winter drizzle , walk aimlessly until you find yourself at cafT near the Jardin des Tuileries where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then move on to the Louvre , where even during the off-season the lines prove daunting . So you cross the Seine on the Pont Royal , ignoring the motor din that washes the bridge , study the murk of the water below , try the MusTe d'Orsay and murder your feet for a couple of hours , sucking in the fruits of genius . Then , deeper into the grubby side streets of the Left Bank , where you press yourself into the all-in-black throng , and laugh inwardly at an imagined wheezy accordion sound track overpowering the burping motor scooters and the whining Renaults . <br> It was early afternoon , near a shop in St. Germain , when it happened . <br> Robin and I had stopped into a dark , narrow men 's haberdashery with a window full of aggressive neckties and slouching mannequins with pickpocket eyes . The rain had been coming in fitful bursts all day . The umbrella we 'd cadged from the hotel concierge was n't generous enough to shelter both of us and we each ended up more than half-wet . Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with droplets and her cheeks were flushed . She 'd been quiet since we 'd boarded the plane in L.A. , sleeping for most of the flight , refusing dinner . This morning , we 'd woken up late and barely talked . During the walk across the river , she seemed distracted  --  staring off at nothing in particular , holding my hand , then dropping it , then grabbing again and squeezing hard , as if scrambling to cover for some infraction . I put it down to jet lag . <br> The St. Germain stroll led us past a private school where beautiful , chittering adolescents spilled out onto the sidewalk , then a bookstore where I 'd intended to browse until Robin pulled me into the cloth- ing store , saying , " These are good silks , Alex . You could use something new . " <br> The store peddled menswear , but smelled like a nail salon . The shopgirl was a skinny thing with hacked-up hair the color of eggplant rind and the anxiety of a new hire . Robin took a while thumbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt and an extravagant red-and-gold tie of heavy weave , got my nod , asked the girl to wrap it up . Aubergine Tresses scurried to a back room and returned with a stout , cardiganed woman in her sixties who sized me up , took the shirt , and returned moments later brandishing a steaming iron in one hand and the garment in the other  --  newly pressed , on a hanger , shielded by a clear plastic bag . <br> " Talk about service , " I said , as we returned to the street . " Hungry ? " <br> " No , not yet . " <br> " You did n't touch breakfast . " <br> Shrug . <br> The stout woman had followed us out and was standing in the doorway of the shop . She looked up at the sky dubiously . Checked her watch . Seconds later , thunder clapped . Flashing us a satisfied smile , she went back inside . <br> The rain was harder , colder . I tried to draw Robin under the umbrella but she resisted , remained out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray full force . A man scrambling for cover turned to stare . <br> I reached for her again . She continued to balk , licked moisture from her lips . Smiled faintly , as if enjoying a private joke . For a moment I thought she 'd share it . Instead , she pointed to a brasserie two doors up the street and ran in ahead of me . <br> " Bonnie Raitt , " I repeated . <br> We were at a tiny table tucked in a corner of the clammy brasserie . The restaurant floor was a grubby mesh of white tile and the walls were cloudy mirrors and oft-painted brown woodwork . A clinically depressed waiter brought us our salads and wine as if service was harsh penance . Rain washed the front window and turned the city to gelatin . <br> " Bonnie , " she said . " Jackson Brown , Bruce Hornsby , Shawn Colvin , maybe others . " <br> " Three-month tour . " <br> " At least three months , " she said , still avoiding my eyes . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " World hunger , " I said . " Good cause . " <br> " Famine and child welfare , " she said . <br> " Nothing nobler . " <br> She turned to me . Her eyes were dry and defiant . <br> " So , " I said . " You 're an equipment manager , now . No more guitar-making ? " <br> " There 'll be luthiery involved . I 'll be overseeing and repairing all the gear . " <br> I 'll , not I 'd . One-vote-election , nothing tentative . <br> " When exactly did you get the offer ? " I said . <br> " Two weeks ago . " <br> " I see . " <br> " I know I should 've said something . It was n't  --  it dropped in my lap . Remember when I was at Gold-Tone Studios and they needed those vintage archtops for that retro Elvis video ? The tour manager happened to be in the next booth , watching some mixing , and ended up talking . " <br> " Sociable fellow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had her dog with her  --  an English bulldog , a female . Spike started playing with her and we started talking . " <br> " Animal magnetism , " I said . " Is the tour dog-friendly , or do I keep Spike ? " <br> " I 'd like to take him along . " <br> " I 'm sure that 'll thrill him to no end . When do you leave ? " <br> " In a week . " <br> " A week . " My eyes hurt . " Lots of packing ahead . " <br> She lifted her fork and pronged dead lettuce leaves . " I can call it off  --  " <br> " No , " I said . <br> " I would n't have even considered it , Alex , not for the money  --  " <br> " Good money ? " <br> She named the figure . <br> " Very good money , " I said . <br> " Listen to what I 'm saying , Alex : That does n't matter . If you 're going to hate me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hate you , and you do n't want it undone . Maybe you accepted the offer because I made you unhappy , but now that you 've committed yourself , you 're seeing all kinds of positives . " <br> I craved argument but she did n't answer . The restaurant was filling , drenched Parisians seeking shelter from the downpour . <br> " Two weeks ago , " I said , " I was running around with Milo on Lauren Teague 's murder . Hiding what I was doing from you . I was stupid to think this trip would make a difference . " <br> She pushed salad around . The room had grown hotter , smaller ; scowling people crowded tiny tables , others stood huddled at the doorway . The waiter began to approach . Robin repelled him with a glare . <br> She said , " I 've felt so alone . For a while . You were gone all the time . Putting yourself in situations . I did n't bring up the tour , because I knew you could n't  --  should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a small fist along the table rim . " I guess I 've always felt that what you do is important and that what I do is . . . just craft . " I started to speak but she shook her head . " But this last time , Alex . Meeting with that woman , seducing her . Planning a damned date in order to  --  your intentions were good , but it still came down to seduction . Using yourself as a . . . " <br> " Whore ? " I said . Thinking suddenly about Lauren Teague . A girl I 'd known a long time ago , from my quiet job . She 'd sold her body , ended up head-shot and dumped in an alley . . . <br> " I was going to say ' lure . ' Despite all we 've had together  --  this supposed enlightened relationship we 've got , you go about your own business . . . . Alex , basically you 've built this whole other life from which I 'm excluded . From which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wineglass , sipped , made a face . <br> " Bad vintage ? " <br> " Fine vintage . I 'm sorry , baby , I guess it just comes down to timing . Getting the offer exactly when I was so down . " She grabbed my hand , squeezed hard . " You love me , but you left me , Alex . It made me realize how alone I 'd been for so long . We both were . The difference is , you enjoy going it alone  --  you get high on solitude and danger . So when Trish and I started talking and she told me she 'd heard about my work  --  my reputation  --  and all of a sudden I realized I had a reputation , and here was someone offering me great money and the chance for something of my own , I said yes . Just blurted it out . And then driving home , I panicked , and said , What did you just do ? And told myself I 'd have to renege and wondered how I 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home and the house was empty and all of a sudden I did n't want to renege . I went out to my studio and cried . I still might 've changed my mind . I probably would 've . But then you arranged that date with that tramp and . . . it felt completely right . It still does . " <br> She looked out the rain-clouded window . " Such a beautiful city . I never want to see it again . " <br> The weather remained gray and wet and we kept to our room . Being together was agonizing : suppressed tears , edgy silences , too-polite chitchat , listening to the rain tormenting the dormer windows . When Robin suggested we return early to L.A. , I told her I 'd try to change her ticket but I 'd be staying for a while . That hurt her but it also relieved her and the next day when the cab showed up to take her to the airport , I car- ried her bags , held her elbow as she got into the taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long will you be staying ? " she said . <br> " Do n't know . " My teeth ached . <br> " Will you be back before I leave ? " <br> " Sure . " <br> " Please be , Alex . " <br> " I will . " <br> Then : the kiss , the smile , trembling hands concealed . <br> As the taxi drove away I strained for a look at the back of her head  --  a tremor , a slump , any sign of conflict , regret , grief . <br> Impossible to tell . <br> Everything moved too fast . <br> From the Hardcover edition . <br> Continues ...
