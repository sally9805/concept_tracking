Does anyone rival Texans when it comes to the tall tale ? Everything 's bigger in Texas , so does n't it make sense that the biggest whoppers come from the Lone Star State ? Naturalized Texan Carrie Richerson provides some evidence to the affirmative with this doozy of a yarn . <p> SO , MR . SANDOVAL - YOUR company has won the bid for my little project . I suppose I do n't need to tell you that you had some .. . fierce .. . competition ? " The client smiles at Roy . A smile from the Big Man is a fearsome sight . It makes Roy want to run far , far away , very fast . Fortunately for his status as low-bidder on this project , certain portions of his anatomy are not cooperating . Inside his steel-capped work boots , all ten toes have begun to gibber and moan among themselves , and to try to slither back up inside his feet . ( He is aware that other parts are trying to slither up inside elsewhere . ) The toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silently turned to stone . Rooted to the spot , Roy decides there is nothing to do but act like the professional he is . " S , and I guarantee we 'll bring this project in on time and within budget . " " You are aware , I trust , of the ... penalties ... that accrue for nonperformance ? " Now the client is beaming . Fangs glint in the ruddy light . Ice crawls up Roy 's legs to his knees , which begin to quiver like an underdone flan . He tries to imagine a steel rebar shoring up his spine so he does not simply fall to the simmering ground and scream . " S. We 'll be getting started now , " he forces himself to say . " There 's just one thing , Seor , " he adds , as the Big Man starts to turn away . " And that is ... ? " The client 's tone is silky ; the gaze he fixes on Roy could strip the flesh from his bones . " You 're required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statement before we can start , " Roy manages to choke out past a tongue that wants only to flap in abject terror . " I 'm required ? . " The Big Man is suddenly a lot bigger . A lot redder . A lot hotter . He looms over Roy like doom personified . He is almost as terrifying as Roy 's abuela , Maria Luisa Carmina Portillo de Santiago , when she is voicing her disappointment in her grandson . Steam rises from Roy 's sodden clothes , but he plunges ahead . " S. Section 47 of the contract , page 64 : " Contractee agrees to obtain and provide contractor with certified approval of project from the Environmental Protection Agency , and any and all local approvals and licenses , before work can commence . Approved EIS must be available for public inspection at all times at the contractor 's site headquarters . Failure of the contracte to obtain such approvals shall not be counted against contractor 's performance . Failure to obtain such approvals within a timely fashion shall cause this contract to terminate without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulls his damp copy of the contract from his jacket pocket in case the client is not convinced . The moment stretches out . The Big Man contemplates Roy , and Roy stares back , bug- and cross-eyed , unable even to wipe away the sweat that pours down his forehead . Then the client shrugs . " I can see that you are indeed the right man for the job , Mr. Sandoval . Here is your copy of the EIS . " He snaps his fingers and a thick document materializes in his hand . He hands it to Roy ; fingerprints smolder in the margins . Roy checks the EIS carefully . It has all the correct stamps and approvals , and is signed by the commissioner of the EPA herself . Somehow Roy is not surprised to see the Big Man has that kind of pull . Appended to the document are all the necessary local approvals and waivers . He is acutely aware of the client hovering impatiently over him as he reads the papers , in part because of the overpowering reek of sulfur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considers mentioning to the client that there are deodorants to help such a manly Big Man with body odor , then he thinks better of the idea . . " Everything appears to be in order , Seor . " " Then you had better get started , had n't you ? " The client points a razored talon to the sun , already well above the eastern horizon . " Tick tock , Mr. Sandoval . Sundown on the seventh day comes apace . " He vanishes in a cloud of fume and ash . Only a smoking hoofprint remains . Roy gasps with relief and almost sags to the ground as his lower extremities unpetrify . He swings around and waves to his crew . " Andale , hombres ! " Dozens of diesel engines cough to life and begin to puff black exhaust into the clear morning air . The biggest " dozer , under the command of Roy 's gang boss Felipe , spins with almost dainty grace in a half circle and charges toward the survey flags marking the beginning of the route . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " dozer , a conga line of dump trucks , front-end loaders , spreaders , graders , and rollers forms up . Rock crushers , slurry mixers , water trucks , sprayers , asphalt cookers , and all the support vehicles - cooks " RV , first aid RV , Roy 's office RV , and the bunk RVs needed for construction far from civilization - organize to the side . The project is underway . Roy whistles over a dump truck and swings into the cab beside the driver . He has a project , a budget , a deadline . A most inflexible deadline . The first two days they bust rock , tons and tons of it . The demolition crews rove ahead of the " dozers , blowing the largest boulders and rock ledges apart . The bulldozers blade the beginnings of a roadway through the rubble while front-end loaders shovel the debris into dump trucks , which take it to the crushers . More trucks bring the crushed product back to the route , where spreaders and graders form it into road base . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demo expert in the business . It is widely acknowledged that Kath can trim dynamite sticks to the millimeter by eye , and juggle a dozen blasting caps at once , stone sober ( which everyone knows is much harder than juggling them drunk ) . She brings the mountains low and levels valleys , makes the rough places smooth and plain as they follow the ruler-straight line of survey flags westward . On the morning of the third day , out past Kingdom Come , Kath brings Roy the bad news . " Survey flags disappeared last night , boss . " Roy has been expecting trouble since the moment they started the project , - he is almost relieved that something definite has finally happened so his stomach can stop winding itself in knots . This problem will be easy to solve ; he expects more serious attempts at delay to follow . " Get Jorge and his crew out there with the transit . And Kath - set guards tonight . " She nods and goes off to rouse the surveyors and to unlock the armory . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unbelievable ! Roy makes sure his people have plenty to drink , but most shrug off the temperature . No es nada , they say , and work on stoically . Felipe pushes back his Stetson and spits into the dust . " This is nothin ' , Jefe . El Paso in July - now that 's muy caliente . " The afternoon brings a spot of good news . Roy 's nephew , Ramon Benitez , brings him a sample of a new slurry . Ramon is Roy 's sister 's son , the first in the extended Sandoval familia to get a college degree . At Texas A &.M; University he studied chemical engineering and agronomy , and he is fond of saying " El Dios never made a better chemical engineering factory than the brown Jersey cow . " His great ambition is to own a small dairy herd of his own ; for now he makes Roy 's job easier by constant tinkering with the many surfacing , binding , and weather-proofing chemicals used in paving operations . He shows Roy a capped jar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flaking rock . " It 's this local brimstone , TIo Roy , from Hell 's Half Acre . We can crush it and use it instead of fly ash . It saves us a lot of money , the slurry spreads easier , and sets up faster and harder . " Roy examines the test plot . The reformulated slurry has set up into a smooth , hard surface full of tiny glittering flakes . " Qu esl " he asks . " Iron pyrite , To . Fool 's gold , " Ramon answers . Roy okays the change . It will save them more than money ; it will save time they would have had to spend trucking in the fly ash from power plants back in East Texas . They start spreading the new slurry that afternoon . The first section will be ready to tar by the next morning . That night only a few survey flags disappear . Guards with rifles patrol the route , setting off road flares every few hundred feet . They report vague shapes skulking in the darkness just outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a target , and a skull-jangling howl greets his success . Morning reveals the corpse of a wolf-like creature four times the size of a Great Dane . " Hellhound , " Kath says , pushing the animal 's lip back with the barrel of her rifle to show a fang as long as her hand . Kath brings the news to Roy , who is watching his tar boss roll on the first layer of asphalt sealer . Roy is an asphaltenophile , a connoisseur of heavy hydrocarbons . He knows his tars , from Athabascan bitumen to Trinidadian pitch . " I love the smell of asphalt in the morning , " he tells Kath . " It smells like .. . progress . " He is in too good a humor to be dismayed by Kath 's report of the Hellhound . He agrees with her plan to handle the beasts if they return . Roy has been running his crews in shifts from first light in the morning until full dark . He knows that toward the end , his people will have to work all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has let them get as much rest as possible for the sprint to come . It is during second shift lunch , right at noon on the fourth day , when the plague of snakes arrives . They are rattlesnakes , sidewinders as long as gravel trucks and with hides armored like a Caterpillar . They bite two lunching workers and an assistant cook , while bullets from side arms and rifles bounce off harmlessly . The toll would be higher , but for their habit of coiling before a strike . As one huge head , jaws agape and fangs dripping corrosive venom , weaves back and forth above her , Kath pitches a lit stick of dynamite into the gullet . BLAM ! When the smoke and the rain of snake parts clears away , so have the snakes . Deep scores in the rock show the fleeing trails . Roy sends scouts armed with RPGs after the surviving snakes . They destroy two more and report the rest have vanished . Quick action in the emergency RV saves the workers'lives . Roy has had his medics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just such contingencies . He directs the cleanup of the site and the careful butchering of the remains of the snakes . That evening the workers feast on rattlesnake fajitas , with mounds of corn tortillas and roasted chiles . " Delicioso ! " They salute the cooks . " jTastes likepollo ! " That night the Hellhounds return , but this time Kath has sent her teams out equipped with night-vision goggles , laser sights , and tefloncoated bullets . All night long Roy 's dreams are punctuated with the crack of rifle fire , and in the morning he swings up the side of a dump truck to view a reekingpile of carcasses . " Treat them like el coyote , " he tells Kath . Ramn has come to report on the progress of his asphalt crews and overhears Roy 's instruction . " What is she going to do with them , To Roy ? " " Wait and see , nephew . " A few hours later , Roy stops his pickup beside the canopy where Ramn has set up his headquarters for the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy opens the truck door and motions Ramn inside . " Come , nephew . Let us ride the route and see how work is progressing . " Behind the asphalt team , at the beginning of the route , crews are already building forms for the concrete , while at the far end of the route , the slurry teams are finishing the road base . Every few miles , Kath 's hunters have hung up a Hellhound carcass beside the roadway . " Is that what you meant , To ? " " S. With el coyote , you kill one and hang him up in the yard to warn the others . Figure it will work with Hellhounds , too . Remember this , nephew , for when you run the company - though let us hope you never have a project like this . " Roy grins at his nephew , then turns serious . " Ramon , even if we survive this , your mother my sister may never speak to me again for bringing you onto this project . If we fail , we lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of Paraso . " Ramn squints into the sun dazzle out the windshield . " We wo n't fail , To Roy . This is the best road-building crew ever assembled , and they know what we stand to win . We wo n't fail you . " Roy drops Ramn back at his dispatch hut . " We work the night through , nephew . Tell your people . " " S , To Roy . " That night , as the asphalt crews hasten to seal the road base ahead of the form construction teams , swarms of vampire bats , so thick they blot out the stars , swoop down to feast . But the cooks have been adding bushels of garlic to the daily menudo and posole , and the bats flutter away in confusion . The ultrasonic cries of so many might have damaged the workers " hearing , but Roy has told his bosses to enforce the rule requiring earplugs on the job . At the height of the attack , Felipe turns on the ultrahigh-frequency broadcaster . Stunned bats rain from the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Ramn asks Roy , " Why did n't Felipe turn the power high enough to kill them , To ? " Roy sips his coffee and smiles . " Think , nephew . Where do we get most of our paving contracts ? From the Legislature in Austin . We do n't need to acquire a bad reputation with those bat-huggers . " Just before dawn , Roy sends everyone but the forms construction teams for a few hours " sleep . As the sun rises he sees maroon and purple clouds massing overhead . He tells the foremen to mount rain canopies over the RVs and heavy equipment and to move all other vehicles and tools under shelter . Then he turns in for a few hours of sleep himself . The rain of blood begins midmorning and continues all day . Under the canopies they have fashioned from the Hellsnake skins , the concrete crews begin pouring . Roy and the sleeping workers are lulled by the patter and hiss of smoking drops on the impervious hides . By early afternoon Roy wakes . He dons a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check the progress of the pour . They are using a quick-setting formulation of Portland cement and crushed brimstone that would harden even under water ; the rain of blood has no effect on it except to tint the topmost layer a bright pink . Roy chats with the workers for a time as they swing the concrete chutes about and level and smooth the slabs . They swap stories of rains of blood past . " I was in a hurricane of blood once in Veracruz .... " " That 's nothing ! I was in a blood tornado ! " " My a buelo told me he was working cattle on a rancho near Harlingen once when there was a flash blood flood , and that 's how come Santa Gertrudis cattle are red . " By nightfall the blood eases off to a drizzle and by midnight it is over . Felipe reports to Roy that the first aid unit has treated a few burns , and everyone has a headache from the noxious smell , but no equipment has been lost , and they are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now a rain of frogs - that would have been nasty ! " All night and all the next morning the concrete crews pour slabs , while the finishers follow behind smoothing , edging , cutting expansion joints and filling them with asphalt so the concrete can expand and contract through the blazing days and freezing nights without heaving . The construction teams , having finished making concrete forms , start building the tollbooths and toll plaza . By the time lunch is over , the concrete work is done , there have been no more problems , and Roy is getting more and more tense as he anticipates some further disaster . Only the finish work is left . The stripers load up with paint and start out at one o'clock . Behind them , crews set the adhesive reflectors to mark the roadway center lines and lane lines . The construction teams finish the tollbooths and the electronics crew installs and tests the automatic toll counters . We are going to make it , Roy thinks , as he watches the sun slide down the sky . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then Felipe is at his side . " Jefe , we got ta problem . " No , thinks Roy . Not now . Now when we weie so close . " It 's the striping paint , Jefe , the midline yellow . We were running low , so I sent some boys to the depot in Lubbock . The supplier was out , said somebody came in yesterday and bought up every barrel . And there 's no time to order some delivered from Houston . " " How much do we need ? " " I figure we 'll be short only about a hundred and fifty feet . About two quarts . " One hundred and fifty feet , Roy thinks . It might as well be a mile . Or the distance between Paraso and Infierno . Roy looks at the sun . The bottom edge of the disc is touching the horizon . A sulfurous wind is rising , and inside his head he hears a vast voice intone softly , Tick , tock . He has never failed to bring a project in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Follow me ! " he yells at Felipe as he swings into his pickup and floors it , racing for the striper as it approaches the end of the route . He slams to a stop behind the slow-moving machine and swings up onto the fender . At his gesture , Felipe jumps up beside him . Roy pries the lid off the paint reservoir , - the last dregs of yellow paint are draining toward the outlet to the roller . " Steady me , " Roy orders Felipe as he yanks his edging tool from his belt . He shoves his arm into the reservoir and slashes open his wrist . " Keep going ! " Felipe yells to the driver as yellow fluid pours out of Roy 's arm into the reservoir . Roy wraps his free arm around a handhold and leans over the reservoir . " Whatever happens , " he tells Felipe , " do n't stop short . " DISTANT VOICES float through the blackness . " To Roy , can you hear me ? Is he going to be okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of your mama 's barbacoa and some cervezas , he 'll be bien . El tigre , that 's your tio . " The blackness is starting to lighten to gray . Roy can feel he is lying down , - something cold is being pressed to his forehead . Then there is another voice , and Roy must , now must , open his eyes . " Well , well , Mr. Sandoval . That was very clever of you . It was something I did not anticipate , and that is saying a lot . " There is a crowd around him , but Roy knows the owner of that voice . " All Sandovals bleed highway-marking yellow , Senor . Paving is in our blood . Help me up , " he says to his crew . Ramon protests , but Felipe and Kath shush him and haul Roy to his feet . Roy feels as empty as a broken pinata . Someone has bound his wrist tightly with a bandana . He leans on Felipe and raises his eyes anxiously to the horizon - the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Mr. Sandoval . You have completed the project as per the specifications . Your payment is being credited to your account even as we speak . " Roy straightens and turns to look at the client . The Big Man does not look happy , but now Roy is not afraid . " And our bonus ? " he asks . " Here . " The client hands over a thick sheaf of documents . " ' Get Out Of Hell Free " passes for everyone on your crew . And their families . Now I suggest you had all better be going , while I am still in the mood to honor our contract . " The heavy equipment and RVs are waiting for Roy 's signal . The first souls are already lining up at the tollbooths . As each passes through , a sepulchral wail rings out . Roy turns to leave , then turns back . " If I may ask one question , Seor . " The client glowers . " One . " " Why a divided six-lane superhighway ? There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Big Man regards Roy as dispassionately as though he is just another mote already broiling in Hell 's infernos . " I appreciate the irony , Mr. SandovaL " He turns to watch the ever-lengthening lines at the tollbooths . " I expect my ... guests ... will appreciate it also , though not perhaps with the same pleasure . Now go . " He stamps a hoof and disappears with a sulfurous blast . " Vaya conDios , Seor , " Roy whispers , " though you would not thank me to hear me say it . " Roy turns to his crew crowded around , and his heart swells with pride in these men and women . " Vamanos con Dios , amigos ! " he cries , lifting the sheaf of passes into the air . Cheering , whistling , and clapping greet his announcement before the crew scatters to their vehicles . The conga line forms up again , heading back to civilization . Roy limps to Felipe 's pickup and climbs wearily into the passenger seat . As the truck joins the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he trusts will be his last look at the entrance ramp to Hell . Someone on the crew has taken the time to erect the customary project notification : THIS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT COMPLETED BY : SANDOVAL PAVING CO . ROY SANDOVAL , PROP . YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK Someone has crossed out the " Sandoval " before " Paying " and carefully lettered " Buenos Intenciones . " Roy laughs , and Felipe raises an eyebrow at him . " Want me to fix it , Jefel " " Hell , no ! " Roy says . " I think I 'll change it permanently ! " Felipe grins . " No problemo ! " he whoops and floors the accelerator .
