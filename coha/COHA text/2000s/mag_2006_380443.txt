Almost four months since it opened , the trial of Saddam Hussein has been plagued by violence and the courtroom antics of Saddam and his seven co-defendants . Saddam 's boycott of the court last week forced its chief judge to adjourn hearings until next week . So is a credible trial still possible ? A look inside the world 's most contentious courtroom . 1 - IN THE DOCK <P> From the start , Saddam and his co-defendants  --  all charged with playing a role in the 1982 massacre in Dujail , a town north of Baghdad  --  have disrupted the trial by questioning the court 's legitimacy and accusing the judges of being pawns of the U.S. When Barzan Ibrahim Hasan al-Tikriti , Saddam 's half brother and former spy chief , was forcibly removed from the room last week after calling the court a " child of adultery , " Saddam and the entire defense team stormed out in protest . The trial , which is held in the hulking former Baath Party headquarters inside Baghdad 's heavily guarded Green Zone , will resume Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead they will be able to watch proceedings on closed-circuit television . If Saddam wants to question witnesses , which is allowed under Iraqi law , he can pass written queries to his attorneys . The chief judge says the defendants may return if they behave " in the proper way " but that their presence is n't essential for the trial to continue . <P> 2 - ON THE BENCH <P> Raouf Abdel-Rahman was appointed last month to head the five-judge panel . For security reasons , three judges are not identified and never photographed . Abdel-Rahman took over after former chief judge Rizkar Mohammed Amin resigned to protest meddling by Iraqi government officials . One of Saddam 's lawyers claims that Abdel-Rahman , a Kurd from Halabja , has a " personal feud " with Saddam and is n't impartial . Abdel-Rahman has rejected complaints by the defense , declaring that " political speeches have no place in this courtroom . " <P> 3 - BRINGING CHARGES <P> The team of attorneys is led by chief prosecutor Jaafar al-Mousawi . Two have declined to be identified for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his co-defendants ordered the killing of 143 townspeople , mainly Shi'ites , in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt on the former President in 1982 . In court , the prosecutors , like prosecutors anywhere , prod witnesses to testify against the defendants . <P> 4 - GIVING WITNESS <P> Under the Iraqi criminal system , the court hears testimony from " complainants " who describe the alleged crime , followed by witnesses who corroborate the details . Those testifying sit in a screened box , and their voices are sometimes digitized to disguise their identity . The 27 people who have testified so far have provided detailed accounts of torture at the hands of Saddam 's security forces , but only the last two have directly implicated any of the co-defendants . <P> 5 - FOR THE DEFENSE <P> The original eight-member team included former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark . After the defense lawyers walked out of the courtroom last week , they were replaced with a new , court-appointed team , but Saddam and the other defendants refuse to attend the trial until the new chief judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been denied access to pieces of evidence against their clients . <P> 6 - PEOPLE 'S COURT
