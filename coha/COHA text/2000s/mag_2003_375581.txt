They say big men do n't cry . But they did n't say it last week  --  not if they watched Kobe Bryant speak publicly with a moist remorse that was almost Clintonian . The NBA 's youngest-ever All-Star acknowledged having committed adultery . " I love my wife with all my heart . She 's my backbone , " he told reporters at the Staples Center , home of Bryant 's Los Angeles Lakers . A tear scarred his cheek as he grasped the hand of his giga-gorgeous wife Vanessa and said , " You 're a blessing . You 're a piece of my heart . You 're the air I breathe . You 're the strongest person I know . And I 'm so sorry for having to put you through this and having to put our family through this . " <P> This is an indictment that he sexually assaulted a 19-year-old college student and employee of the Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Edwards , Colo. , while he was staying there for knee surgery . The complaint , brought by Eagle County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feloniously , and knowingly inflicted sexual intrusion or sexual penetration on " his accuser , whose name was withheld by police and the press . <P> On June 30 , Bryant left L.A. for a tendinitis operation that was to be performed the next day at the Steadman Hawkins Clinic in Vail , the town of plutocrat-posh ski-resort fame . Bryant and his entourage checked in to the Lodge and Spa . Around 11 that night , his accuser , a concierge and receptionist at the hotel , went off duty . According to the Los Angeles Times , Bryant called his wife from his hotel room at 11:13 . Some time later , perhaps around 11:30 , the young woman visited Bryant 's room . Why she went there , and what happened next , is for a jury to decide . <P> The next morning , Bryant had his surgery . At noon the young woman , accompanied by her parents , told the Eagle County sheriff 's department that she had been assaulted . She went to Vail Valley Medical Center for tests . At 11:30 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators from the sheriff 's office quizzed Bryant in his room and collected evidence . Hours later , technicians at Valley View Hospital took samples of Bryant 's DNA . <P> Bryant fiercely denies the rape charge , which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment . He acknowledges that sex took place but insists it was consensual . " I did n't force her to do anything against her will , " he said . " I 'm innocent . " <P> Another star athlete charged with sexual malice ? Such an item is usually confined to that burgeoning beat , the sports-page police blotter . Kobe Bryant makes it front-page news  --  not simply because he and Shaquille O'Neal are the Guts and Godzilla of the star-studded Lakers , not because he scored 30 points a game last season or because he went straight from high school legend to NBA phenom . Not even because he recently inked a $45 million endorsement deal with Nike . But because he is one of the NBA 's prime icons of clean and keen . <P> With handsome features and a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rep of a star a prim mother or an innocent kid could love . " For teenage girls especially , " says Peter Zollo of the polling firm Teen Research Unlimited , " Kobe is way up there . Where Allen Iverson 's been the bad boy , Kobe has been the pretty boy . "
