<p> Betty ( but call her BJ ) Ostergren , a feisty 56-year-old from just north of Richmond , is driven to make important people angry . She puts their Social Security numbers on her Web site , or links to where they can be found . <p> It 's not that she wants CIA Director Porter J. Goss , former secretary of state Colin L. Powell , or Florida Gov . Jeb Bush to be victims of identity theft , as were millions of Americans in the past year . Ostergren is on a crusade to scare and shame public officials into doing something about how easy it is to get sensitive personal data . <p> Data brokers such as ChoicePoint Inc. and LexisNexis Group have been attractive targets for identity thieves because they are giant buyers and sellers of personal data on millions of people . <p> But as federal and state lawmakers try to keep sensitive information from falling into criminal hands , they face a difficult dilemma : The information typically originates from records gathered and stored by public agencies , available for anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What 's more , local governments have in recent years rushed to put these records online . <p> A wealth of documents  --  including marriage and divorce records , property deeds , and military discharge papers  --  containing Social Security numbers , dates of birth and other sensitive information is accessible from any computer anywhere . Many of the online records are images of original documents , which also display people 's signatures . <p> Ostergren began organizing citizens and complaining to officials on the issue in 2002 , when a title examiner called to warn her that her county was about to put a slew of documents online , including pages with her signature . <p> A longtime activist in local politics , Ostergren swung into action , bringing enough pressure on Hanover County officials that they halted their plans . Then she broadened her attack , targeting other counties in Virginia and elsewhere . <p> Today , she is eager to guide reporters to her favorite example : the Social Security number of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R-Tex. ) , which is viewable via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Do n't you think if I can get Tom DeLay 's Social Security number . . . that some guy in an Internet cafe in Pakistan can , too ? " she asks , her voice rising with indignation . " It 's just ridiculous what we 're doing in this country . " <p> The drumbeat of identity-theft revelations is the stuff of nightmares for cash-strapped county recorders , court clerks and other custodians of public records , even without people like Ostergren hounding them . They could start masking out sensitive data tomorrow for new documents they receive , but billions of records already are online . <p> " It 's a national issue and it 's hitting everybody , " said Kathi L. Guay , the register of deeds in Merrimack County , N.H. , who participates on a joint task force of public agencies and companies addressing the issue . <p> In addition to providing citizens with information on how their government operates , many public records are essential for commerce . <p> Knowing who has legal title to property , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax lien can also affect a person 's ability to buy or sell property or other goods . In some circumstances , Social Security numbers can help distinguish between people with common names . <p> But for decades , Social Security numbers , mothers ' maiden names and other crucial forms of personal identity were routinely included in dozens of documents , regardless of whether they were essential and with little thought to the consequences . <p> That , in turn , enabled companies such as ChoicePoint to send workers to courthouses across the country to scoop up the data for their databanks . The information is collated , or analyzed , and sold to other companies and back to government agencies . <p> Many counties package their data to make it easier for database companies to collect it . <p> " Public records laws were designed to shed the light on government activities , not our personal information , " said Kerry Smith , an attorney with Public Interest Research Groups , a coalition of state consumer advocacy organizations . States are " clearly not striking the right the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to our financial identity  --  to commercial data brokers and anyone with access to the Internet . " <p> Some states have passed or are considering laws restricting the release of certain kinds of data . Florida , for instance , gives consumers the right to have Social Security numbers and other data blacked out from view online . <p> But few local governments have the resources to go into all existing online records to remove sensitive data . <p> " Usually when you are talking about these issues , no one is talking about it retroactively , " said Chris Jay Hoofnagle , West Coast director of the Electronic Information Privacy Center , an advocacy group . " They are talking as if it ca n't be addressed . Which is too bad . " <p> One exception is Orange County , Fla. , which recently awarded a $500,000 contract to a private company that will comb through its 26 million pages of online records , masking Social Security numbers and other confidential information . <p> " The mortgage lenders and title searchers are very concerned that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant county comptroller . " But my answer is , ' I sure do n't want to take the whole document away . ' " <p> The Florida Legislature has ordered the masking of data to be completed throughout the state by the beginning of 2006 , but so far only eight counties have signed contracts for the work , said Foglesong , who expects an extension . <p> Foglesong and others are pinning their hopes on technology . <p> Companies that mine data often boast that they can use software to collect individual pieces of data from images of documents that are posted online . Similar technology can be used to mask certain data . <p> But many in the industry are pessimistic that nationally , sufficient resources will be available . <p> " It 's probably going to be a county-by-county undertaking , as record custodians are able to convince local administrators that this is worthy of taxpayer dollars , " said Mark Ladd , a former register of deeds in Wisconsin who works on privacy issues for the Property Records Industry Association . <p> Ostergren sees the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do n't put them online . <p> " If you want to go snooping in my records , you drive to the courthouse , " Ostergren said . Most identity thieves , she reasons , will neither take the time nor want to be seen . <p> In the meantime , she pursues her guerrilla campaign . <p> Her formula is simple : Target a county , locate personal data on hundreds of residents , send them letters telling them how much of their personal information is or might be exposed online , and urge them to pressure their local officials . <p> " I thought it was the most ludicrous thing I had ever heard of , " said Mary Guest , recalling her reaction when she got a letter from Ostergren while living in Front Royal a couple of years ago . When she found out it was true , Guest  --  whose husband had been in the Virginia House of Delegates before he died  --  began pressing Warren County officials not to post records online , which they so far have not done . <p> When Ostergren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her number on her Virginia Watchdog Web site might further her cause . <p> Which is how she came to link to Jeb Bush 's Social Security number . <p> She notified him through someone she knew in the administration of President Bush . Soon after , she noticed that the governor 's number was blacked out on the county Web site in Florida where it was listed . So she posted it on her site . <p> " I decided since he protected his own hind end and nobody else 's , I 'd put his on there , " she said .
