<p> In one sense , the transition from J.R . Pinnock to Danilo Pinnock was a simple matter . After one preseason practice in late October , George Washington 's starting guard approached the school 's sports information director and said that henceforth , in news releases and box scores and television reports , he wanted to be known by his real first name , Danilo . <p> That was his father 's name , and it was his 2-year-old son 's name . It was the name under which he competed for the Panamanian national team last summer , and it was the name he wanted to use for his junior season . <p> In another sense , though , the process was more complex . The transition from J.R . to Danilo turned a player who was ineligible to play basketball his senior year of high school into the leading scorer for the No. 15 team in the nation . It turned an opinionated freshman who would occasionally melt down with frustration into a junior who coaches say is one of the emotional leaders of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bedroom to avoid his father into a 22-year-old who has taken on his father 's name to make him proud . <p> And that transition has left coaches saying that they hardly recognize this Danilo Pinnock as the same person who arrived in Foggy Bottom 21/2 years ago . <p> " It 's not even close , " George Washington Coach Karl Hobbs said . " He 's the fire of our team . My question for him is , ' Are you going to warm the house up or are you going to burn the house down ? How are you going to use that fire ? ' And I 'll tell you what , he probably has come as far as anyone in our program . " <p> The origins of " J.R . " were fairly straightforward . Pinnock 's father had immigrated to the United States from Panama as a teenager , and his army career took the family to Texas , Seattle , Alaska , Alabama and Georgia , where no one seemed to be able to pronounce " dah-Neel-oh . " Tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally known as J.R. , for " Junior . " <p> The son had always been above average in both class work and athletics , but as a high schooler in suburban Atlanta he began feuding with teachers and then losing interest in school . His father went to look at his son 's progress reports and saw 80s and 90s on tests , and nothing but zeros on homework assignments . <p> By the second semester of his senior year , Pinnock , who had also been a successful wide receiver on the football team , no longer had the grades to play sports , and so he paid even less attention . <p> " I 'm not a rocket scientist , but I 'm not slow , " he said . " I just did n't have a purpose . . . . I was going , but there was n't no point in me going . I was n't doing nothing . " <p> Around the same time , he and his father began arguing more , about his friends and his habits and his behavior . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earned two bachelor 's degrees as an adult and is working on a master 's in information resources management  --  tried to persuade Pinnock to take school seriously and to think about his future . A few times , the disagreements prompted Pinnock to leave home and stay with friends ; his American-born mother , Bootsie , would then persuade him to return . <p> " Now I can sit here and say it was my fault , " Pinnock said . " It was just me being young and dumb . " <p> Finally , with Pinnock unable to qualify for college , his father , AAU Coach Desmond Eastmond and mentor Kevin Wales helped Pinnock enroll at Coastal Christian , a prep powerhouse in Virginia Beach . During that year Pinnock made and then broke a verbal commitment to Wichita State , and his girlfriend became pregnant with their son . He thought about leaving school and getting a job , but was instead persuaded to go to college and wound up at George Washington He averaged 9.8 points as a freshman , was named to the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard worker . Still , his emotions spilled over on the court , and if he missed several shots in a row or was removed from a game or corrected by a coach , he was likely to lose both his focus and his temper . <p> " We used to always say the best part and the worst part was the same thing : the emotion , " assistant coach Darrell Brooks said . " When you play at such a high emotional level all the time you can teeter on going one way or the other . Now he does n't teeter . You know which way he 's going and it 's going to be a positive way . " <p> Pinnock took up to 2,000 jump shots during practice sessions last summer , going to the gymnasium three times a day and staying until 2 or 3 in the morning . He now averages 15.4 points , 5.1 rebounds , 3 assists and 3 steals . His long-range jump shot remains a work in progress , but his shooting percentage has gone up all three years at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge to try to make the highlight , " but he 's also developed a floater to go along with some of his jaw-dropping dunks . Coaches said he no longer loses his focus on the court , and he said he no longer loses his focus off it . <p> " I 've came too far , too many people sacrificed too much for me to get this far , and now I have my own son to set a path for him to follow , " he said . " I ca n't go back to doing the dumb stuff I was doing . " <p> Part of the difference , Pinnock said , is that he wants to please Hobbs , who is both a coach and a friend . Part of the difference is that he now tries to set an example for his son , whom he calls his inspiration and motivation . The third Danilo Pinnock , known as " Tre , " stays with Pinnock 's parents in Georgia but has already been to three GW games this season and can identify most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old can already say " Pops , " and " he tried to say ' Mensah-Bonsu , ' but it do n't quite flow right , " the father reported . ) And part of the difference , Pinnock said , is that he 's now decided to follow his father 's advice . The two still bicker occasionally  --  the elder Pinnock , for example , does not approve of the younger Pinnock 's baggy shorts . But they work out together , and they watch basketball together , and last June they spent about two weeks in Panama together , where J.R . gained dual citizenship to play for the country 's basketball team . <p> After he returned from George Washington 's summer exhibition trip to Australia , Pinnock immediately departed for the Dominican Republic , the site of last summer 's world championships qualifying tournament . The 6-foot-5 guard missed all the team 's practices and Panama 's first game , against the United States . He spoke barely a word of Spanish , and his father arrived the next day , prepared to act as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " a lot of sign language , " the elder Pinnock said  --  and the new addition immediately helped the team , which went on to earn a berth in the world championships for the first time since 1986 . Pinnock was the team 's youngest player and second-leading scorer , averaging 15.4 points against largely professional opposition . <p> " I do n't think we could have won on a consistent basis until we got a kid like him , " said Nolan Richardson , the former Arkansas coach who led the Panamanian team . " He could dunk on Superman . . . . I was telling him , at this pace and the way you work and pay attention , you have a chance to play at that next level , big time . " <p> Which is becoming a popular opinion . St. Francis ( Pa . ) Coach Bobby Jones , who has seen Pinnock play two years in a row , called him " one of the most underrated players in the country at his position . " Hobbs was even more emphatic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to play in the NBA . " <p> Pinnock said he , Hobbs and his father will discuss the future after this season . As of now , he said , he plans to return to Foggy Bottom for one more season , to finally have a senior night and to get a sociology degree that his father could display on his mantle piece . <p> Indeed , impressing his father has become a priority for Pinnock , which is how J.R . finally became Danilo . Some of his father 's Panamanian friends had Americanized their names ; " Victoriano " became " Vic , " " Alejandro became " Al " and " Ricardo " became " Rick . " The elder Pinnock had never wanted to lose his heritage , and during the trip to the Dominican Republic , the son  --  who had been considering the switch for weeks  --  began using his real name . <p> " Does n't that sound good ? " the elder Danilo Pinnock asked . And the younger Danilo Pinnock , who still wears his Panamanian jersey during pregame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my name just to honor my father , " he said . " Me having my son , seeing how prideful I am with him , I know my father has to feel the same way about me . And I gave my son the family name because I want him to carry out the legacy , carry that name to higher levels .
