<p> HOUSTON  --  From the glass-walled building and manicured lawn to the security guard who greets visitors in a cheerful Texas drawl , everything at Citgo Petroleum seems perfectly ordinary . <p> But in fact there 's nothing ordinary about Citgo . One of the USA 's largest refiners , Citgo is a subsidiary of Venezuela 's state-owned oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. ( PDVSA ) . As such , it ultimately belongs to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , an avowedly anti-American leader who counts Fidel Castro among his closest friends and mocks President Bush as a " genocidal murderer . " <p> The question of Chavez 's influence over Citgo was highlighted by the company 's recent provision of 25 million gallons of subsidized home-heating oil to poor people in the northeast USA . More than 100,000 households in four states should eventually benefit from the low-cost heating aid . <p> Some worry that Venezuela 's ownership of more than 6% of U.S. refinery capacity gives Chavez , a former paratrooper given to wearing red berets and military fatigues , the power to cripple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated , any disruption to the nation 's refining industry instantly increases gas prices . What if Chavez , who periodically threatens to curtail oil shipments to the USA , closed Citgo 's refineries ? <p> " He 'd only have to do that for 90 days , and he 'd destroy our economy , " worries Matthew Simmons , a prominent energy investment banker . " He actually has our livelihood in his hands . " <p> Others note that imported oil from elsewhere eventually could compensate for any interruption in Citgo supplies . And , because Chavez depends on the company 's specialized refineries to process Venezuela 's sulfur-rich crude oil , a shutdown would cost him and his country dearly . <p> " His capacity to make life difficult for George Bush would be at the cost of burying himself , " says Claudio Loser , a former International Monetary Fund official . <p> Late last year , as winter 's first chill sent consumers reaching for their thermostats , a dozen U.S. senators asked 10 major oil companies to donate a portion of their record profits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to housing projects in New York and Massachusetts in what Felix Rodriguez , the company president and chief executive , called a purely " humanitarian " gesture . <p> Today , the program expands to homeless shelters and Native American tribes in Maine . Friday , Rhode Island gets its initial delivery . <p> Many analysts , however , saw the move as a stunt by Chavez aimed at embarrassing the Bush administration . And some say Citgo 's generosity  --  likely to cost it more than $20 million  --  suggests the company may be turning into a political tool for Chavez . <p> " It has had a turn for the worse , perhaps the much worse . ... Now it 's a different entity . It 's not completely run like a business , " says Antonio Szabo , a former PDVSA official and the president of Stone Bond Technologies , a Houston energy software firm . <p> Citgo executives say the company , founded in 1910 as Cities Service Co. , is solidly profitable and can afford to offer the poor 40% discounts on heating oil . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giveaway so poor Americans would n't have to choose between food and heat . <p> " The only difference between Citgo and other companies is that Citgo has only one shareholder , " he said , referring to the Venezuelan president . <p> State Department spokesman Adam Ereli welcomed the heating aid , saying , " Citgo is an American company . They are helping Americans in need . That is a good thing . " <p> Earlier , the company 's Hurricane Katrina aid efforts earned a nod from Bush . " The good works of Citgo demonstrate the character and great strength of our nation , " the president wrote Citgo Sept. 27 . <p> Yet , there are echoes in Citgo 's recent performance of what has transpired elsewhere in Venezuela 's oil industry since Chavez was elected in 1998 . After a coup in 2002 briefly ousted him from power , Chavez retaliated by purging the state-owned oil company . Thousands of veteran executives and petroleum engineers were cashiered , replaced by those politically loyal to the president 's revolutionary aims . <p> Anti-American foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.5 million barrels a day from 3.3 million barrels in 1999 , says Luis Giusti , who quit as national oil company president when Chavez took over . But thanks to oil prices above $60 a barrel , Chavez 's control of PDVSA has allowed him to lavish billions of dollars on social projects and an anti-American foreign policy . <p> Citgo , which sells gasoline through more than 13,500 retail stations and is known for its iconic sign towering over Fenway Park 's left-field wall , paid the Venezuelan government $697 million in dividends in 2005 , up from the previous year 's $400 million , Rodriguez said . <p> PDVSA  --  the acronym is pronounced Ped-a-vay-sa  --  first acquired 50% of Citgo in 1986 . Four years later , the Venezuelans bought the remaining half of the company from Southland , better known for its ownership of the 7-Eleven convenience stores . The company 's six refineries , with a capacity of 1.1 million barrels of oil a day , are ideally suited for Venezuela 's sulfurous , heavy crude oil . <p> Throughout the 1990s , Venezuelan oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Citgo was an American company . We happened to own it , " said Giusti , who headed PDVSA until Chavez took over . " We managed it at arm 's length . " <p> That changed under Chavez . In October 2000 , the new president tightened control over Citgo by naming as company president a former army general , Oswaldo Contreras . He was the first Venezuelan to hold the position . <p> Bush was elected president the following month , but relations did n't completely sour until after Sept. 11 , 2001 , when Chavez likened the U.S. war in Afghanistan to the terror attacks in New York . Washington later publicly welcomed the coup that toppled him for two days in 2002 . Chavez has accused the Bush administration of planning his assassination . <p> In November , two weeks after leading anti-American protests at a hemispheric summit in Argentina , Chavez told a business group in Caracas : " The planet 's most serious danger is the government of the United States . ... The people of the United States are being governed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The comment followed congressional testimony by a State Department official that labeled Venezuela " a threat to regional stability . " <p> Asked how the persistent bilateral friction was affecting Citgo , Rodriguez replied , " No effect . Nothing at all . " But Chief Operating Officer Jerry Thompson , the most senior American remaining at the company , acknowledged Citgo 's customers are concerned . " What it introduces is an element of anxiety , and our competition takes full advantage of that , " he says . <p> The uncertainty was exacerbated for much of last year by a protracted and costly relocation of corporate headquarters , management upheaval and Venezuelan officials ' repeated suggestions that they might sell some or all of Citgo . <p> After decades in Tulsa , Citgo last year completed an $82 million shift to its new five-story headquarters in the heart of Houston 's Energy Corridor . The move was designed to benefit the company by planting it squarely in the world 's self-proclaimed " energy capital . " <p> But asked whether the move was worth the cost , Thompson says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> New management team <p> The relocation also cost the company managers who opted not to leave their longtime home , compounding executive turnover that saw several top American executives and the entire board replaced with Venezuelans . <p> Giusti , the former PDVSA president , says the current Venezuelan management team is weak . He criticized CEO Rodriguez for lacking substantial international experience and fluency in English . " Felix Rodriguez belongs to a group of engineers who never made it to the top . They only took their positions as a result of being loyal to the revolution of Chavez , " he says . <p> In an interview , Rodriguez , 56 , noted he is a petroleum engineer with 32 years experience . Speaking in heavily accented English , with occasional help from an interpreter , he said he had held a series of planning and supervisory positions , traveled to the North Sea oil fields on " special assignment " and had been vice president of PDVSA before being named Citgo 's CEO . <p> Even as Rodriguez moved into the top job , Venezuela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all of Citgo with " several companies . " But Rodriguez says there are no sales plans and despite political tensions between Washington and Caracas , the commercial relationship remains " win-win . " <p> Profit lags behind some rivals <p> Citgo executives also point to their financial record to rebut suggestions that politics are taking precedence over profits . For the first nine months of 2005 , the company reported net income of $419.3 million on revenue of $31 billion compared with $430.3 million in profit on revenue of $23.7 billion for the same period last year . <p> Asked if he was satisfied , Rodriguez replied , " So far , so good . " Thompson said the company enjoyed a strong fourth quarter that will push net income above last year 's figure . But at a time when industrywide profit margins are fat , some competitors have done much better . Industry leader Valero , for example , earned $2.7 billion on $56.3 billion in revenue for the same period . For every sales dollar , Valero earned 4.7 cents in profit . Citgo reaped just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal involved refinancing its outstanding corporate debt . In October , the company secured bank financing of $1.85 billion , which it used to pay off its bond holders . Among the bonds paid off was an issue of $250 million in 6% senior notes the company had issued just one year earlier . <p> The move was the corporate equivalent of refinancing a home twice in 12 months . " They did what we thought was a fairly strange thing , " said John Addeo , portfolio manager for the MFS High Income fund , which owned $5.7 million of Citgo bonds . <p> Citgo says it refinanced to obtain greater financial flexibility . The terms of its bond offerings restricted the company 's ability to take actions , such as selling assets and paying dividends , according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> Meanwhile , company executives say drivers pulling up to Citgo gas pumps are n't worried about who owns the refineries that produce the gas . " Being owned by a political entity ultimately means , from time to time , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heating oil is an example of that , " says Thompson . But " By and large , people see us as an American company . "
