The man I learn from drives us from carnival to carnival in a Chrysler hearse with a convertible top . In Futura Bold , it says Theobald 's Body Shop . He is a man in his mid-forties-trousers , all of expensive cotton ; shirts of silk . He has a different pair of soft-leather boots for every day of the month . Between the ages of nineteen and twenty-eight , he was a change-of-pace pitcher for the Cleveland Indians , and still carries a canvas bag fat with baseballs and a collapsible net boxed with the strike zone . We can be driving along-he 'll pull over , get out , slide the net from the back , set it up , heft the duffel , pace the distance , shovel earth so that it makes a mound , and pitch for an hour or two . " Watch how I break inside , " he 'll say . " I 'm an original . " Then he 'll call me over , as though I were his catcher and we needed to be clearer about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ask . " You holding up ? " <p> When I was two and a half , I almost died . I 've read the hospital report . It says , Tipped over in highchair : Accident . When I was three , I almost died again . Tripped over a breakfront leg . I almost died three times when I was four . Fell accidentally from a bicycle with training wheels . /Did n't see open refrigerator door . /Lost balance on stairs . When I was five , I was taken out of my house and given to another family . Tried to remove hot embers from the fireplace . //Got into kitchen drawer and played with knives . <p> " Two irreducible fundamentals- " the man I learn from will say , " if you 're going to pitch-breaking inside and change of pace . " <p> There are books-some people call them studies-and certain words appear again and again . My favorite one is target . It is not uncommon for the target to ... In 78% of the case studies , the target often ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a child , little girl , and became a target . When I was eleven , I was the target of a Sunday school teacher ; after that , the target of boys who asked me out ; later still , the target for needles . And I guess I 'm a miracle , too . Young lady : it 's a miracle you 're alive , a counselor said once . So I 'd been a target-of and a miracle most of my life-up until I met the man who 's now teaching me . <p> I had learned to embroider-somewhere : a foster home . At a certain point , later , when I was in a detox shelter , I took to embroidering targets . As the man teaching me sees it : my fingers were targets-targets making targets . I stuck them in the stitching ; they bled . The way the shelter ran , you could earn points-for things you owned up to in Group , say , or for the number of days you 'd been clean , major points for cooperating with Drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of points , you could go out for an hour ; more points , two ; the highest number , you were called a Trustee and could go anywhere . <p> I was a Trustee-a Target and a Trustee . Different times , I would go out , walk the streets . It was a small city ; a place where my almost-dying had brought me ; it was in Nebraska . Some people say there are n't cities in Nebraska , but that 's wrong ; there are . I had a favorite dim sum Chinese restaurant , Caf Hong , and I would go there , sit in a bamboo circle of steam baskets-har kow and sesame balls , SMI- mai and chicken feet . I 'd spear shiny pastries with chopsticks , sit and read the case histories of other people , women mostly , who , like me , almost died . <p> One early afternoon , the man I 'm learning from now came in . It was uncrowded . He sat two tables away , ordered a mixed vegetable lo mein , shrimp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either meditated or prayed . Then , he removed a knife from a sheath and cleaned his nails , wiping the knife on a paper napkin . <p> " Careful , " I said . <p> " Always , " he said . He inventoried my table : " Chicken feet , " he said . <p> " Chicken feet , " I confessed . <p> " It 's where I got my arm , " he said . <p> " Chicken feet ? " I said . <p> " Right : swinging them , " he said . " Around and around-in a crazy windup-it would break their necks . " <p> I think I made some kind of a face . <p> " I grew up here-out here , " he said . " The West-a ranch ; a farm . Growing up-my chore , the way I earned my allowance , was swinging chickens . Limbered my rotator-possibly . Anyway , I loved the sound-feathers pinwheeling in the air-and feel . And so I started to pitch . " <p> Probably , I looked stupid , stared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't , and I suppose my face , somehow , showed it . So he pulled a paper napkin from the napkin dispenser on his table , wadded it , stretched , wound up , threw it at me . " Pitch , " he said . " I started to pitch . " <p> " Pitch " I said and nodded . <p> Then he squinted . " Hey-your fingers , " he said . <p> " What . " <p> " Sorry-I ca n't help ; it 's the curse of an observant personthey 're all- " <p> " Oh-I know , " I said . " I do embroidery . " <p> " Possibly , " he said . " But embroidery does n't do that . I 've done embroidery . What I 'm seeing , I think , you did to yourself . " <p> " You 've done embroidery ? " <p> " Needle . Needlepoint . Some . Not a lot-a little . Petite-point . Enough to know the whole object is : design , but without damage . You forget : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes pitching 's design ; sometimes it 's damage . Often it 's both . But it 's a choice-always . " <p> He put his face in his green tea , inhaled , sipped some , inhaled again , set the tea down , got up , crossed to me , lowered himself , squatted beside my chair , reached , took my hand , touched my fingers with his fingers . <p> " You do n't need to do that , " he said , looking at the pinpricks , the red stubble . " It 's a choice . You 're aiming at yourself . Do n't . " <p> He had been a pitcher-I 've said-and whatever the Cy Young Award is , he 'd been nominated . Twice . Calling those nominations rewards sufficient unto themselves . His wife had run away with his catcher . He had reassessed his aims and quit-somewhere near the top , he said . <p> I offered him a small pork bao . He took it , held it to his nose , then against his cheek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he closed his eyes . I waited . <p> " Why does it seem that you 're ready to learn ? " he asked with his eyes closed . <p> " Well- " I began . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Maybe- " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Maybe because I am , " I said . <p> " I can teach you , " he said . <p> " I believe you , " I said . <p> He peeled the white paper from the bao and bit it . " This is very good , " he said . " This is excellent . " <p> " They make them fresh-every day , " I said . <p> " Wonderful-miraculous , " he said . " Can we meet tomorrow-just after noon ? Here . Can you put aloe on your fingers and be ready to travel ? " <p> " I can , " I said . " I can-I 'm a trustee . " <p> From carnival to carnival , I began-naming our route . And it 's true . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pace-became a knife thrower . Midway man . I 'm a **29;2084;TOOLONG ; half-Geek . He jokes and winks-as if we only have the power to sort truth out from secret , as if there 's something between us that 's a privilege . It 's a gentle wink ; he 's a gentle man . We share green tea and steamed pastries . And I have learned all about the weighting of blades . I have mastered the carved and helical grip . I have studied both velocity and alloy . He calls it learning the language of The Game-punctuation of point , grammar of gesture , score of error . I am a novice , though-still-learning always . Serve , I learn ; prepare ; become that which I have never been . He has advised me : dissect couragelabeling his advice , part of the catechism of the knife . He calls us Coconspirators , but he 's a man of generosity to a fault . Before we met , I was directionless . <p> You 're right : what am I saying when I say directionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Social Services report : For all intents and purposes , the client appears ... What I mean is : I had no comprehension of next . I had no next moment-obviously no next month , no next week . There was no next place . I had no sense of moving either toward or away , no sense of occupancy-myself occupying . Nothing about me took up . Do you know what I 'm saying ? Space . <p> The first time that I hid away until after closing so that I could spend all night in a library and read , the lights I turned on triggered an alarm . Ten minutes later , five guns circled me . What 're you doing here ? the police officer holding the middle gun asked . Reading , I said . The library 's closed , he said-his gun conducting the air . Oh , I said ; oh . Shit ! I 'm in a library , I thought ; these are police . Search her , another officer said . Two minutes later , they had handcuffed and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **38;2115;TOOLONG said , You 're very lucky . Because we could prosecute you for Trespassing in a Civic Facility . From then on , whenever I spent a library night , I left the switches alone . Instead , I read by setting up sometimes a dozen candles . <p> The man I learn from teaches me , now , how to trespass . " Trespass , " he urges . And he throws the word at me with a wicked smile-as though it were round and had little stitches on it . " Think velocity , " he hisses . " Think occupy . " <p> I liked the art books . In my library days . The great big ones-della Robbia and Vermeer . In the middle of the night , lit by wax , all the different colors in the art books moved like skin . Especially the colors of a man who painted names like Storm and Harbor . His name was Turner . Leafing through his paintings was like a hot bath or seeing my body on a warm day in a mirror in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked and alone near where someone had just swung the censer in a church and organ notes hung , still , in the air and drifted . I liked this painter-Turner . Very much . I did . He seemed forgiving . It felt good that he knew all the colors of a bruise but knew , too , when the bruise was healing . Even though he called the bruises names of water-still , I knew . <p> Some people , now , will think , Oh , dear ! or even , Stupid bitch . And , of course , I 've heard that . Oh , dear-stupid bitch spends whole nights sitting in libraries-looking at pictures ! Ca n't read . But that 's not true ; I can . I 've read a lot . I read , for instance , about a woman , living in Berlin in 1943 , who sang in clubs . Writing about her voice , journalists used words like Haunting ! and Pure ! and Rare ! and Remarkable ! All her gowns had targets , stitched frflm sequins , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star of David . The woman 's name was Leah , and her friends , the book said , thought her crazy by announcing Here I am ! to her enemies . So they begged her to : Stop . Begged : Please . Then , when she did n't , they stayed away . They were afraid her **31;2155;TOOLONG might , somehow , radiate out and include them . But then-and here 's the mystery ; because no one remembers anything said-but after a time of staying away , the friends began coming back . They sat , drank , ate , spent evenings together , claimed their closeness , listened . Armed officers appeared , like , I suppose , the officers who arrived at my night-library , but the story is : something about Lean 's voice-the hush , the attention ; the wine being poured ; simple food , shared , stayed any attack . It was not defiance , the book read again and again by candlelight declared : It was not defiance . I memorized that . It was not defiance . That seemed important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn from instructs me . And I try to . <p> Okay : here is what any knife thrower does . First , the knife thrower dreams knife-thrower dreams . It takes a while ; they slip in ; they 're deceptive . In the beginning , knife-thrower dreams are very much like the dreams you 've always had : no particular light , no fluted air , no blood . At first , all the familiar people are present , too-mixed with all the familiar unfamiliar people . But then the tempo changes . And there 's a bluer tint . Or-all of a sudden , there 's a Ferris wheel and a dwarf . There will be a nude you 've never seen-neck or abdomen smeared arrestingly with blood . These are the early days , weeks , months . This is the beginning . <p> Also : the knife thrower silkscreens . Posters . Will . Begin . They will be heavy with blacks and silvers , Chinese reds . Midnight blues . Figures in the posters will appear to be wearing evening clothes and white gloves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rose . If not a rose , a gardenia . If not a gardenia , a cigarette . What 's overwhelming is the sense of night , though it 's not simply night ; it 's more elaborate . <p> As well , the knife thrower meditates . For echoing voluble hours . And the knife thrower is a Feldenkrais practitioner . The knife thrower writes villanelles and ballads-I have begun a ballad with the working tide , " Song of a Trustee . " One of its lines is : I ship my skin to Portugal . The knife thrower studies counterweight , learns ballet . The knife thrower is a lepidopterist but only when lepidoptery arises . In this , what is true is pinning . If pinning 's called for , pinning will take place but pinning always clothed in a precise care and nomenclature , pinning schooled in the art of prism , pinning informed by the brevity of life and accomplished always through refraction . <p> Then , of course , there 's The Assistant . The Assistant stands-you 've seen . The Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , in any pitch and spangled carnival night . Calliope music plays . Often , quite near , a spider monkey dances , leaps hurdy-gurdy at a string 's end and extends his cap . Carved , painted horses lope the air like pistons , around and around . And , all the while , The Assistant stands-patiently and politely . The Assistant waits-familiar with the singing air that has not yet really sung-but will . With all that 's Accuracy . With all that 's Skill . Because The Assistant is The Assistant , after all , and is beholden . <p> I am not The Assistant . I need to repeat that . I am not The Assistant-I 've learned this . I am She Who Learns . I have been taught that : there is The Lancing of the Skin , and there is The Surrounding of All Life , and , between these , stands an enormous difference . What I want is to possess my body-not to be the locus of misdirected points , embroidery or otherwise . Not to be the target of random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline on the rug . What I am involved in-and perhaps here , somehow , I 've misled you-is being Practice and not Target . That 's the opportunity that the man I learn from has extended to me . He says , " You will hear the word arrogant , and you will hear the word defiant . Listen to no one ; be proud you 're both . " <p> He has never missed . I 've never seen him . Still he says , " Nothing deceives more than accuracy . Be vigilant . " His dreams , he says , record endless disaster , genocide . " I 've chosen a path , " he says ; " I stand ; I calculate-load , lift , hurl-error is constantly within reason . " <p> Error is constantly within reason . His words whistle the airthere for bloodletting , there for theft . I think I will work them into my next villanelle . <p> And so-if it is a Tuesday and , say , Moline-I am mindful . In the Indiana dark , I prepare . All-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower gets ready for August . A yellow cat , somewhere among chrysanthemums , dreams of towhees and finches . <p> I love riding in our hearse with the top down , sightseeing with my guide . Across all this continent 's between-carnival landscapes , we are , at once , a-thing-free and **31;2188;TOOLONG : motion and lethal instrument . The man I learn from says , Every journey is a defiant pilgrimage and undertaking . And I have not found , yet , any reason , to dispute . Then he might reach into this cloth sack he carries , scoop raw rice , withdraw his fist , whip it high into wild corkscrew wind , opening his fingers like a magician's-hundreds of grains sailing into the world like seeds . " Unless we 're careful , " he says , " this could be the end of Nebraska ! " Or the Sonora Desert . Or Mississippi . Or the Everglades . <p> I know I 've said this-but I am not The Assistant . What I am preparing for-because he is , after all The Knife Thrower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be The Blade , The Knife . That 's my apprenticeship . That 's what-Chance constant and Time kind-I will become : The Knife . Sometimes I place my hands over an open fire to season them . Other times , I lower my face . Flinty sparks scatter past my cheekbones . I try always to feel the weight of myself , the balance . A hundred times a day , the man I learn from lifts me over his head , so that I can feel-not just on my skin but in my blood and bones-the extension , the load , the cock . <p> Someday , someplace , I will know gifted hands . Moments of weight will give way to moments of weightlessness , and , for the time that 's necessary , I will be pure direction . I will be aimed . I will be just like a windy and held note in the fluted air . Someday-Greater Spirit willing-I will be that tempered thing that could slip between your ribs and into your heart , that which could **34;2221;TOOLONG .
