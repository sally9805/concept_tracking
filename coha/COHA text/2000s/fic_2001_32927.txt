Chapter It 's when you 've been rejected by your third sperm bank that your life , such as it is , begs to be reconsidered . So that 's what I 've been doing these last wet days of March , two weeks past my 34th birthday . Taking the scratchy woolen sock that is Nicholas and turning it inside out and shaking it clean . Mostly , though , I 've been thinking about Atlantic herring . These are fish that travel in large schools and reproduce about as casually as I untangle phone cords : When they 're ready , they just gather in the same vicinity and , on the count of three , divest themselves of eggs and sperm . No courtship rituals . No ecstatic unions . No lace valances in the nursery . They scatter their seed , they swim on . The rest of their lives stretches before them like a putting green . Maybe one night in forty they wonder how their little soldiers have made out , but mostly they swim . I think about the Atlantic herring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The latest letter seems to acknowledge this , subtly : It refers to me as an " aspirant . " Dear Aspirant , Thank you for your interest in Capitol Cryobank . At the present time , however , we find ourselves in a surplus situation , insofar as supply far exceeds current demand . Consequently , we are unable to consider even worthy candidates at this time . You may be assured that we will keep your application on file and will contact you should any future need arise . We thank you again for your interest .... All very businesslike . The vague reference to " worthy candidates , " for instance , the unwavering politeness . I nearly choked the first time I read it . Maybe if they 'd known how hard it was to find them in the first place , how I spent the better part of a day calling around to OB/GYN offices and fertility centers looking for names , names . The longer it went , the crazier I got . " All I want to do is donate some sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gaithersburg . " The rest of it does n't matter , " I said . " Really . You would n't have to hear from me ever again . " " I 'm sorry , " the woman said . " As a rule , we import from California . " Which threw me , I admit . California ? " In addition to which , " the woman said , " we can not take these kinds of inquiries over the phone . " " Can I make an appointment with someone ? " " Well , you can , but not here . " " Why not ? " " Because our sperm comes from California . " I said , " Maybe if I telephoned you from California .... " " Now you 're being silly , " she said . It was like that the whole afternoon . I could n't shake the feeling that everyone I talked to , by prearranged agreement , was trying to stop me . Stop me outright or just send me down unprofitable side routes . " Now let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did all seem to be women . ) " You want to donate or you want to freeze your own ? " " I do n't want to freeze anything , " I said . " I just want to leave my sample and go home . " By four-thirty in the afternoon , I was sagging in my swivel chair , staring at the crumbling tile on the office ceiling , trying to decide if I could go on . I could . I could make one more call , to a scratchy-voiced woman from the Franconia Family Complex , who gave my question about two seconds of thought and said , " Well , there is Capitol Cryobank . Out in Manassas . " At which point I was so tired I failed to detect the anomaly : " Capitol Cryobank , " located not in the monumental corridor of Washington , D.C. , but in the suburban splatter of Manassas , Virginia . Which begged the question of why it bothered to call itself " Capitol . " What patriotic imperative , what call to arms was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that 's the name I went with . Clearly , my desperation got the better of me , caused me to become emotionally invested in what , for all I know , is a borderline Chapter 11 operation . The name alone should have warned me , and if not the name , the 12-page questionnaire they sent . Understand , I did n't go down this path with any illusions . I expected questions . I recognized that the sperm highway needs tollkeepers . But these inquisitions ! My job , my salary , hobbies , sports , sleeping rhythms , politics . Every last offshoot of the family tree . I was asked the medical histories of women I 've never met , women who came of age in mill towns and wore cloches and danced the Lindy . How the fuck should I know ? But I soldiered on . I checked off all the medical conditions that could possibly apply ( warts/moles , deviated septum ) , answered everything as best I could , stuffed the sheaf of paper into the pre-stamped envelope , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patiently for The Call . And The Call turned out to be a form letter on pomegranate card stock . Which , believe it or not , was a step up from the previous responses . At least the first place I tried had a sweet-voiced young receptionist . " Reproductive Re-sources , " she said , and as she spoke , a picture emerged in my mind : an auburn-haired colleen with a big , heart-shaped locket and freckles running across the bridge of her nose . She called me " Mr. Broome , " which in the context I appreciated , and she did n't seem to mind all the questions . She was prodigiously patient . " I 'm curious about the afterward part , " I said . " I mean , say there 's a child that actually results from this . Would I ever know ? Do they let you know ? " " No , sir . We would need to protect the privacy of the parents and , of course , the child . As I 'm sure you understand . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just .... Ok , say the child grows up . Turns 18 , 21 , whatever the age is and wants to get in touch . Can he do that ? She . He , she . " " No , sir . We keep your medical information on file , naturally , but your name would not be attached to it . " " Oh . " " That 's how we protect all the parties involved . Including yourself , Mr. Broome . " Such a lilt she imparted to my name . She gave it a coloratura bloom . " No , that 's fine , " I said . " I 'm perfectly comfortable with that . " " And are there any other questions you have at this time ? " she asked . I wanted to keep talking . I wanted to listen to her bell-chime voice for the rest of my life .... " No , " I said . " I think that 's about it . " " Ok , Mr. Broome , my name is Tammy . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate to call us . " That rejection arrived three weeks ago : a Xeroxed form letter that began , " I 'm afraid we have some disappointing news .... " I called about the possibility of appeal . I left a long and I think coherent message , specifically requesting Tammy . I said , " Tammy has already spent a great deal of time with me on the phone , and I would like to discuss with her whether these decisions are irrevocable . Or whether there are materials I could send in that would bolster my candidacy . " I think I kept it under five minutes , but I suspect my message is now Diagram C in the training-course syllabus : Stalkers , Prevention and Handling of . Tammy never did return my call , but that spark of human contact gave me the momentum to take on Fertility Emporium , an enterprise with no street address and endless tunnels of voice-mail options , mazes with no center . At each mailbox , the same ersatz female , speaking in the same computerized timbre , said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the tone , please leave your name and number . When you have finished .... " Who were these parties ? What species ? I could n't evoke a single freckled colleen from their ranks . All I could imagine , after days of message-leaving , was that they were operating a virtual sperm bank , and every morning I would hook up my dick to a modem and fire off a load of digitized seed and receive a two-line e-mail bulletin whenever contact was made .... In all , I left six messages at Fertility Emporium . To this day , not one has been answered . For all I know , they 're gathering my sperm as I sleep . Sometime around Valentine 's Day ( and what a discouraging holiday that was ) I had an epiphany : The direct engagement of sperm banks was a fool 's game . Because , and do n't we all know this , proper channels are for suckers . Was n't it entirely possible that just beyond the line of everyday consciousness lay a vast black market of sperma byzantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know me , but my friend Gameto suggested I call .... " In quick succession , I telephoned five OB/GYN offices in the Bethesda area . As soon as a human came on the line , I made the usual discreet inquiries , and then , the moment the wall reared up , I 'd shift into conspiracy gear , collapse my voice into a faintly European register . " So that 's what you 're telling me , " I 'd say . " On the record . " " Yes , sir . " " So maybe now we can talk about some other way . " Whereupon the receptionist-we 'll typify her as a grandmotherly sort named Eileen-would say , " I 'm sorry ? " " I mean , since we 're both adults . All I 'm saying is maybe you know someone . Who can refer me to someone .... " And Eileen would say , " Someone what ? " " Someone who .... " Here 's where my resolve would begin to falter . " ... who knows about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whereupon Eileen , watching the phone lines light up like Roman candles , would say , " Sir , if you or your wife need an appointment , I would be happy to set up a time . " The humiliation and , yes , the surrealism . When did it become this hard to give away your sperm ? From all I 've read , from all I 've ever heard , college boys have been making quick bucks at this for years . Successive generations of young men , astonished at not having corsage money for their house-party dates , have hightailed it to the nearest clinic , shut themselves in a closet and , a couple of yanks later , emerged fifty bucks richer . Is n't this how it 's always worked ? I ca n't help thinking that if I were still in college , still an inchoate being , I would have a much better chance of being selected than I do now . It 's living that has disqualified me . It 's being alive at the front end of the 21st century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I should have known better . " That 's what I tell my friend Shannon . Shannon knows I need sympathy , so she provides it the way she knows how , which is to take me to a piano bar on Capitol Hill , across the street from a boarded-up lesbian bar , and treat me to one round of my favorite drink ( sidecar ) and interrupt our conversation every time her cell phone rings . " Shit ! " Up comes the index finger . " Ok , sorry , just ... hold the thought , all right ? " Out comes the little espionage phone from her black Fendi bag-she starts speaking before it even reaches her lips . " This is Shannon . Yeah . Hi . " Her eyes roll a little , for my benefit . " No , I have n't heard back , but remember what I said ? The Times is very low odds . Ten quintillion op-eds a day , so it 's ten quintillion to one . Right . Right . " Shannon is wearing a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top half of a bandleader 's uniform . More and more , she is dressing like a blonde , although she has the darkest coloring I 've ever seen on a blue-eyed woman . " So I 'll let you know as soon as I hear , " Shannon says . " Ok ? And if it does n't fly there , we try the Post , the Journal . But you got ta be patient on this , ok , Harold ? Ok . All right . " The phone vanishes into the handbag . She takes a draft of air . " Fucking . Idiot . " She is sitting on a rattan throne , next to a sagging rubber tree , and behind her a black woman in an enormous anthracite wig is playing " The Girl from Ipanema " on a baby grand . Shannon claims to hate the music here , but now and again you can see her lips moving , almost sulkily , to the words . " O-kay , " she says , drawing herself back together . " You were saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , right . " " Even trying to negotiate with these places , playing their ridiculous fucking games . Giving my family 's medical histories to ... to men in dingy lab coats . Men with phony stethoscopes . " She nods absently . " Tell me the name of that last place again . " " Capitol Cryobank . " " Hmm , " she says . " Does that inspire trust in you ? Cry-o-bank . Is any trust inspired by this name ? " " Um . " She frowns a little , eyes me over her vodka martini . " I do n't know about trust . Maybe science fiction it inspires . " " Exactly . That 's my exact point . Dime-store science fiction . Which is what I 'm talking about , I should have known . " She 's squinting at me . It 's an effort sometimes , figuring me out . Do you understand , she seems to be saying , what an effort it is ? " So ... when you first got in touch with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you sent them your application . " " Yes . " " You thought they were legitimate . But now you do n't . " " No . The point is this is clearly not a legitimate company . Was never . Which I did n't know enough then to know whether it was . " Shannon nods twice . She clicks her tongue against the roof of her mouth . " Ok . Now how would you feel if they had accepted your application ? " She has a slightly triumphant , professorial manner to her . She believes she has found the crux of everything . But it 's not the rejection , or it 's not just the rejection . Although , when I think about it , who knew the industry was this selective ? Who would guess that aspiring mothers-aspirants-driven to this particular exigency could be so damn choosy ? They must sort through the genomes like wallpaper patterns . Well , sure , he 's healthy and HIV-negative and college-educated , and there 's not a single misdemeanor or felony arrest , but look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother had colon cancer and his great aunt had a hysterectomy when she was 67 . And he 's vulnerable to hay fever . We can do better .... " They could do worse than me , " I say . " Of course they could , " she says , nodding emphatically . " For all they know , for all anyone knows , somebody 's wife-beater genes are , you know , being implanted in wombs across America . Molestation genes . They let all that shit through , and then something unbelievably minor shows up and ... and down comes the portcullis . " " What 's a portcullis ? " " You know , that ... grating thing . " " Oh . " " On the door of a castle . " " Right . " Shannon tugs at the hem of her bandleader skirt , rubs her fingers together . " You know what I 'm going to say , " she says . I honestly do n't . " How the world ? Being the way it is ? " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it , are n't you ? " " Yeah . " " All right . " She rehearses the words silently for a few seconds . " A gay man , " she says . " A gay man is not going to be picked to spawn new generations . I mean , it 's awful , but that 's the world . " My left knee , out of nowhere , starts doing its agitato dance . The sidecar , balanced on my thigh , bounces along . " Actually , " I say , " I did n't tell them that part . " " Which part ? " " The gay part . " There is a charged silence from the rattan throne . A sigh of apprehension . " Haaa-haanh , " it sounds like . I am looking away now , but I know what 's happening : Her left eyebrow is trembling with irony ; her lips are sphinctering together , to avoid all possibility of irony . I start talking into my drink . " There was a process to this , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts . I told them everything . Because maybe these are progressive kinds of places , with hip moms and dads , you know , twin Volvos and funky credit cards and random acts of kindness , you know ? Come in , maybe , and look over the data and kind of like all the rest of the stuff and maybe they 're willing to overlook the one part . " " Uh huh . " " So when I got turned down , I figured well , wrong , Nick . ' Cause parents are n't progressive about their own kids . So the third time around .... " " Uh huh . " " That was the one thing I changed . By change I mean I did n't mention it . They asked : ' Have you had sexual encounters with men ? ' And I just left it blank . But everything else was right on . " " So just a little illegal , " Shannon says . " I do n't know . I did n't think much about it . " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I found myself swerving , even by a small degree , from truth , a whole new realm of license opened up in my mind . I thought : If I can change this one elemental part of me , why ca n't I create an entirely new Nicholas ? Give myself a more attractive birthplace ( screw Norfolk ) . A Stanford education . A graduate degree in international finance . And then start in on the whole Broome clan . That wacky bunch of nonagenarians ! Feisty , cancer-free . Poets and silversmiths and squash champions . My sister : an archeologist , sieving Etruscan crockery out of Sicilian ruins . My brother : healing Kurdish lepers . My parents : eccentric venture capitalists riding the bull-market rodeo . Oh , what I could have created ! But I did n't . I ran straight up the high road . And not from principle but from paranoia , the kind only a technological ignoramus could entertain . I was convinced that Capitol Cryobank had computer applications that would sniff out deceit , flag even the subtlest forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; almost certainly I did . " You know what ? " Shannon says . She 's craning her neck , looking for our waitress , who was last seen about 20 minutes ago . " Even if you left it blank ? It would n't matter because they probably assume no answer means guilt . " She shrugs . " The only reason I mention it is ethically you 're off the hook . " " I do n't care about the ethics , " I say . " It was an experiment . The first two were the control , right , and the third one was the variable . " " So .... " She 's turned herself around now . She 's waving both hands at the waitress , like a gospel preacher . " So the experiment failed . " " Well ... yeah . I mean , in the sense they blew me off . Yeah . " She turns back around . " No no no . Nicky , listen to me . It 's a credit to you it failed ! You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " She makes a small shudder for me . " All the shoes you would have to buy . The shoes alone , Nicky . Listen , " she says . " Who gives a shit if they blew you off ? It 's , like , a badge of honor . " She does n't get it . I have n't made it clear . It 's not the rejection-really-it 's just I had this vision of how it would be . In this vision , I 'm making the weekly trip to the Manassas , Virginia , headquarters of Capitol Cryobank . I leave early , a little after seven , to beat the traffic . Something baroque is playing on the classical music station . Sound walls-limestone and beige-line the highway , and peering over them are the emptied balconies of Arlington condos and brick ramblers , four decades old . I drive alongside the high-voltage fences of the Metro tracks , and my car easily outpaces the westbound Orange Line train , chugging toward Vienna . I see the familiar names , the Beltway outposts : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . To where I grew up . Ravens on power lines . Oaks and sycamores and Virginia pine . Park-and-rides and half-built town homes with Arthurian names . Wal-Mart and Kohl 's and the headquarters of the National Rifle Association . Within 50 minutes , the outskirts of Manassas materialize . I ease off the highway , and two minutes later I 'm turning into the Cryobank headquarters , in a small office park with pebbled sidewalks . I park my Toyota Camry in Space Number 23 . I walk into the onyx building , give my name to the receptionist . The physician 's assistant , an attractive young Asian woman with teardrop earrings , smiles as she bumps open an oak-paneled side door with her hip and motions me to follow . She leads me down a long hallway with a shell-colored carpet . Formaldehyde tickles my nostrils . My ears pick out the diaphanous strains of Enya . The usual southern view , the woman says . Thank you , I say . She hands me three medium-sized glass vials , a box of Kleenex , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needing anything else , Mr. Broome ? Thank you , no . She does n't bother asking me the other things . The things you ask the first-timers . Have you ejaculated within the last 48 hours ? Have you engaged in any strenuous physical activity within the last eight hours ? All righty , then , she says.I 'll let you get to it . The door closes behind her . I stand by the window , watching Jeeps and Mercury Villagers assemble in the parking lot below . I am thinking about fish . I am spooling out the life history of a male Atlantic herring : the shock of birth ; the scaling of the food pyramid ; the senseless locomotion of adolescence . I see his entire destiny , right up to the unforeseen moment when the female next door , answering signals he does n't even recognize , lets loose with a platoon of eggs for his benediction . Come on , kid , I 'm whispering in the herring 's ear . Do your stuff . Make your old man proud . Attaboy . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Enya is cooing in my ear , and this is how life begins .... " The Arboretum sucks . " Shannon is back on the phone . Her legs are tucked beneath her , and her head is tossed to one side-she looks like a bobby-soxer , except for the bandito grin . " Do you know where that is ? " she 's asking . " Have you been there ? It 's fucking Northeast D.C. Now tell me . ( Nicky , the waitress . Walking down the stairs . ) Tell me how many . ( No , run and get her . ) Reporters . ( Vodka martini . Two olives . ) Are going to schlep out to the fucking Arboretum ? " The waitress is wearing a field-hockey uniform and a large cloud of electric-blue hair . She writhes when I touch her shoulder . For a second , I 'm convinced she 's going to scream . I clear my throat . " Vodka martini , two olives . And a sidecar , please . " She gives me a brutish nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clogs lights sparks under her feet . When I get back , Shannon is cooing into the phone . Such a professional seductress . She has extended one of her shapely legs ; a red slingback pump with a brass buckle dangles from her big toe . " Ok , honey , get back to me tomorrow , all right ? Eight-thirtyish sound good ? Ok . Bye bye . " She stares at the phone for a few moments . " That was Joel , " she says . " Ah . " She lunges for her handbag , pulls out a toothpick with a small green ruff at the end , drives it into the corners of her mouth . " Barf . What were we talking about ? " " Nothing . " " Oh , the ... right . " Her lips flare back from her teeth . The pick darts in , wiggles out . " So what does your sister say about all this ? " " Celia does n't know . " Shannon 's eyes are large interpretive blanks . " Huh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrossing . " This is top secret , " I say . " No one 's supposed to know . " The waitress blows past us , blue hair rippling like a sapphire , the pleats of her tartan skirt emitting an audible hum . The glasses fly from her tray , make a concussive landing on the bamboo coffee table . " I 'm doing this on my own , " I say . Which is intended to close the matter , but the only thing that really closes it is Shannon 's fatigue . The empathy is starting to wear on her . " Do n't let me go , " she says , raising an index finger . " Without telling you about the U.S. News guy . " " The one ... his pubes are a different color than .... " " Oh , please , that 's the least . The other night ? The condom starts to slip . Like , halfway through . He says , ' Well , what do you want me to do ? ' And I say , ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' And the rest of the night , not a word to me . Like a little child . Like it was my fault . " Many years ago , Shannon and I almost consummated a brief love affair , and I sometimes think she tells me about her sexual exploits just to show me what I 've missed . Oddly , it has the opposite effect : I feel as if I 've been there the whole way , fanning my wings over the bed . " And he makes yipping noises . Like a Pekinese .... " When we totter out an hour later , Shannon has her hand attached to my arm . She does that now and again , and for the first time I am struck by the tenderness of it . Arousing , frankly . Here it is almost ten-thirty , and when was the last time-think hard , Nick-when was the last time you got laid ? We have stopped at the corner of 8th and D. The night actually got warmer while we were inside . Barely spring , and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flirt back . I turn to look at Shannon , the way you look at someone after several hours of looking at them-as if their reality is in question . She is tugging with drunken ostentation on the gold braid of her bandleader 's jacket . " Refresh my memory , " Shannon says . " Yes . " " Why is this so important to you ? No . " She shakes something out of her brain . " Forget that one . What interests me is the deadline . Why does it have to happen now ? " Both of her hands hoop around my elbow . " Tell Shanny Girl . " " You 're in no condition to discuss this . " " Am too . " " You wo n't even remember . " " I will . Tell Shanny Girl . Big rush , what 's the big rush ? " She 's yanking on my arm , and my balance is already a little suspect , and I see the two of us coming undone , shattering , our limbs settling into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole night to reconstruct : femurs , tibias , patellae .... " I have a year , " I say . " I have less than a year to conceive a child . "
