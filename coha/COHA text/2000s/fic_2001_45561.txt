THIS CREATURE LOOKS more scared than I am . Come knocking .. pawing ... scratching at my door . Come , maybe in search of me ( I 'm easy prey for the weak and scared and hungry ) , or maybe in search of help and shelter .... ( I 'm peering out my window , hoping it wo n't see me . ) It 's been snowing-seems like three or four days now . The first really bad weather of the year so far . <p> It looks so draggled and cold .... I open the door . I welcome it . I say , " Hello new and dangerous friend . " My door 's a normal size , but too small for it . It pushes and groans and squeezes itself in . Then collapses on the floor in my one and only room , its big green head facing the stove . It takes up all the space and makes puddles . <p> There 's a tag stapled in its ear - rather tattered ( both ear and tag ) , green ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded I can hardly make it out . It might be zero seven . Strange that it has ears at all considering what it ( mostly ) looks like . But they 're small - tiny vestigial ... no , the opposite , evolving ears . They look as if made purely as place to put a tag . <p> It 's wearing a large handmade camouflage vest with lots of pockets . Now , while it 's still out of breath and collapsed , I check for weapons , though with those claws , why would it need any ? What it has is old dried crumbs of pennyroyal , left over from some warmer season and some higher mountain , a few interesting stones , one streaked green with copper and one that glitters with fool 's gold , two books , one of poetry ( 100 Best Loved Poems ) and one on plants of the area . Both well worn . A creature of my own heart . Perhaps . <p> It looks half starved - more than half . I have broth . I help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in thanks , but then shows its teeth , blinks its glittery eyes . I jump back . Try to , that is , but I bump into my table . There 's no room with it in here . It shakes its head , no , no , no . Seems to say it . " Mmmnno . " <p> But how can such a creature talk at all with such a mouth ? But then come words , or parts of words . " Thang ... kh ... mmmyou ... kind . Kindly . Thang you . " Then it seems to faint , or collapses , or sleeps - instantly  --  snow melting from its eyelashes ( it has eyelashes ) and rolling off its back , icy mud drying between its claws . The tiny arms look as if made for nothing but hugging . <p> While it seems in such an exhausted sleep , or maybe passed out , I take pliers and carefully remove the staple that holds the zero seven ear tag . I notice several claw marks along its back and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail . <p> Now where in the world did this thing come from ? <p> I 've heard tales . I thought they were the usual nonsense .. like sasquatch , yeti , and so forth , abominable this or that . ( And here , for sure , the most abominable of all . I But I 've heard tales of secret weapons , too . I 've heard there are creatures made specifically to patrol this empty border land . Supposed to be indestructible in so far as a living breathing creature can ever be . Supposed to attack everything that moves in this no-man'sland where nothing is supposed to be but another of its own kind . <p> I 'd probably help even a suffering weapon , I probably would n't be able to keep myself from it , but this one seems odd for a weapon , too polite , and with vest pockets full of dried bits of flowers , that book of poetry .... <p> I drink the rest of the broth myself and stare at the creature for a while . No sense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still dripping . I ca n't even get across the room without leaning against a wall or climbing over my chair or cot . I step over its legs . I squinch over to my front door . I take my jacket . I 'm not worried about leaving the thing alone . It does n't seem the sort to do any harm - unless by mistake . <p> I whisper , " Sleep , my poor wet friend . I 'll be back soon , " in case it hears me leave . It does n't move . I might as well be talking to myself . I do that all the time anyway . I used to talk to my dog , Rosie , but since she died I have n't stopped . I jabber on . No need for a dog for talking . They used to say we men were the silent sex , at least compared to women , but not me . Rosie just made it worse . She would look up at me , trying hard to get every word . Seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as if she was still here , I talk . I talk to anything that moves . <p> As I go out , right outside the door there 's some juniper branches threaded together as though it had made itself a wind shield of some sort and dropped it before it came in . Farther along I see broken branches around my biggest limber pine . It must have sheltered there - leaned against the leeward side . Hard to think of such a creature giving out . <p> I lean against the leeward side , too . You 'd think it would have smelled my fire and me . Perhaps it was already weak and sick . I do n't dare leave it by itself for long but I need space . That was like being in a squeeze gate . Still , I like company . Watch the fire together . Come better weather we could make the shack bigger . It was polite , even . <p> I say , " Rosie , Rosie . " The wind blows my words off into the hills before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced off these cliffs sunrise to sunset . Not a creature here that has n't heard it . I 've called her , sometimes by mistake , sometimes on purpose . Sometimes knowing she was dead , sometimes forgetting . <p> After she died I ran out in a snowstorm naked - and not just once or twice - hoping for .. what ? Death by freezing ? I yelled , answering the coyotes , until I was so hoarse I could n't have spoken if there 'd been somebody to speak to . After that I whispered . Then I sat , brooding over the knots in the logs as I had when I first came out here . Rosie needed me . She kept me human . Or should I say , and better yet , she kept me animal . I do n't know what I 've become . I need this creature as much as it needs me . I 'd make it a good meal . Maybe that 's what I want to be . <p> I squat down , my back against the tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even just waking up and stretching , it could mess things up . <p> I chose this no-man 's land . I came here ten years ago . There 's a war been going on for a long time , but never any action here - not since I 've been around . Missiles fly overhead , satellites float in the night sky , but nothing ever happens here . The war goes on , back and forth above me . Sometimes I can see great bursts of light . I wonder if there 's anything left on either side . No man 's land is the safest place to be . Had I had the sense to bring my wife and child here , they 'd still be alive . Of course I did n't think to come here myself until they were gone and my life was over . <p> I DO N'T KNOW how long I sit , the sun is hidden , but I 've had no need for time since I came . I do n't even keep track of my age , let alone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single one of these thick-skinned things until now . I was n't sure they existed . I did n't want them to . I felt sorry for them even when I did n't believe in them . How can they have any sort of life at all ? Seeing this one , I think perhaps they can . ( Or this one can . ) But here they are in the world in spite of themselves . No fault of theirs . And in all kinds of weather . If they get sick , I suppose they pine and die on their own . <p> The creature seemed .. rather sweet , I thought . Fine fingered hands . Womanly arms . Perhaps it really is female . <p> Then I hear the scraping and thumping of something who has n't hardly room enough to turn around . My poor friend , Zero Seven . I hurry back as best I can , clumping through snow a foot deep in spots . I open my door and go from a wall of softly falling flakes ( softly now ) to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its side as one does to move a horse . I hope it feels my push . I hope it 's as sensitive as a horse . " Let me in , friend . " <p> It moves . I hear something falling over on its far side . <p> " Do gum in . I'mmmm afraig I .... Mmmmm ... as you ksee . " <p> I slide myself in - scrape myself in , that is , it 's the wrong direction for the scales . <p> It turns toward me as best it can and seems to almost bow , or perhaps it 's a nod , one elegant little hand at its mouth as if embarrassed . I do believe I 'm right about the sex . It must be female . <p> " Kh kvery , kvery , sssssorry . I 'll leave mmmm-nnnow . " <p> With me in the way it ca n't turn around to go . Perhaps not even with me not in the way . It 'll have to back out . <p> " Do n't go . Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It goes down into a squat , its stomach on the floor , feet splayed on each side - long-toed , gruesome feet with claws I would n't want to argue with . <p> I slide myself around the creature to the stove on the far side . I should have had the dishes washed and put away . Well , no matter , they 're tin . A few more bumps and scratches wo n't make any difference . <p> No doubt about it , it 's sick . I could even feel that as I move around it . Though how do you know if a reptile is sick ? But there 's an odd stickiness to it and I imagine it normally does n't have any smell at all . <p> " Stay . You 're sick . I 'll make stew . Rest again . " <p> It shakes its head . " Mmmmmukst go . " <p> " I do n't want to find you out there dead . " <p> " Dhuh dhead in here iks worssse for mmgh ... mmyou . " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that a grin ? Can that be ? That the creature has a sense of humor ? Rosie seemed to grin , too . I take a chance . I laugh . It opens its mouth wider but there 's no sound . We look each other in the eye . Some kind of understanding , lizard to mammal , passes between us . Then the creature shivers . I pull a blanket off the bunk , big Hudson Bay , but it only covers the creature 's top half like a shawl . It helps to hold it on with those tiny arms , and nods again . <p> " I 'll build up the fire and get us something to eat . You just rest . " <p> " I hhhelp-puh . " <p> " Please do n't . " <p> It grins again , mouth wide , that row of teeth gleaming , then huddles close against the wall opposite my kitchen area , trying to make itself small . Still , I step on its toes as I work . When I do , we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We both laugh .... Well , I laugh and it shows its teeth . <p> How nice to have somebody ... something around that has a sense of humor . They must have left in some odd rogue genes by mistake . <p> I start to make stew . I have lots of dried chanterelles and I hope it likes wild garlic . It watches me as Rosie did , mouth open . I hum a song my grandma taught me . I thought hardly anybody knew that song but me , but then I hear the creature buzzing along with me , no doubt about it , the same song . I look at it . It blinks a slow blink , as if for a wink . <p> We eat my hare stew , it out of my wash basin . Licks it clean like Rosie always did . At least it has n't lost its appetite . <p> " Have you a name other than that Zero Seven on your tag ? By the way , I took that off . I had a dog , Rosie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . It 's the only name I 've said for years . " <p> There 's that smile again . " Rrrrosie is kfine . Kfine . " Then Kfine turns into a cough . I heat up some wild rose hips tea . I always have lots of that . <p> Then it stretches out again . I pile on more blankets . <p> " Mmmmmnnno mmno . Mmdo n't . " <p> " I insist . You must stay warm . If the lamp does n't bother you I 'll read for a while , but you should sleep . I 'll make the fire high . Wake me if it gets cold . You should be warm . <p> ( My lamp is just a bowl of volcanic tuff with exactly the right hole in the center . I have a big one and a little one . The oil I 've rendered even from creatures with not much fat . Even deer . ) <p> I settle myself with a book . I like having company even if the company takes up most of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Khind , kh hind ssssir . I like being Rrrrrosie . " ( It gargles it out as if it was French . ) " Bhut who are mmmm kh you ? If khyou do n't mmmmind . " <p> " Ben . I 'm Ben . " <p> " Ah , easy khto kkh ssssay . " <p> I think : She . She is a she . <p> When I douse the lamp ( by putting on the lid ) and it 's pitch black in here , I do have a moment when I worry . She is starving . I might be her next meal and a better one than I 've prepared for her so far , or at least bigger . What 's a little broth and then a little rabbit stew ? But I wo n't be facing anything my wife and child did n't face already though my fate might not be as instantaneous as theirs . But I hear her breathing , snuffling , snorting in her sleep just like Rosie . I 'm comforted and reassured by her snores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn , in my one and only window , shows a cloudless sky . I watch the oblong of sunlight move down and across the far wall until it lights on her . She 's a bundle of blankets , but what little I can see of her shines out . Certainly she 's not made for a winter climate . Probably most comfortable in a hot place with lots of shiny green leaves to hide in . <p> She feels the sun the moment it touches her . ( Thick skinned but infinitely sensitive . ) Turns and looks at me . Grins her Rosie-grin . Like Rosie she does n't have to say it , it 's all over her face : Hey , a new day . What 's up now ? And : Let 's get going . <p> " You look better . " <p> She nods . Says , " Mmmmm , nrm . Mmmmm , nnnn . " <p> " We 'll go out , if you like . You must feel cramped in here . " <p> " Mmmmmm , nnnn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that , and more rose hip tea - a pitcher of it for her . <p> " Keep a blanket around your shoulders . And I think you 'll have to back out . " <p> Like my Rosie was before she got old , this Rosie peers , sniffs , hops up on boulders , jumps for no reason whatsoever , she skips in the bare spots where the snow has blown off . Sings a ho dee ho dee ho kind of song . A young thing that , sick or not , starving or not , ca n't sit still . I saw that in my boy . <p> I take her to my viewing spot . You can see the whole valley . I often see deer from here . <p> As we watch , another of these creatures comes down the valley heading south . I have n't seen any until this one sitting beside me , and here comes yet another , and then two more not far behind . Driven down from the mountain passes on purpose ? Or is it the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , at them , at me . I love that look all young things have , animal or human , of wondering : What 's up ? What 's going on ? Is everything all right ? <p> Then those first two turn and trumpet at the others . Rosie 's arms are just long enough for her to cover her ears . ( She must hear extraordinarily well to need to do that from way up here . ) Hard to tell from this distance , but those others all seem much larger than she is . <p> When , a moment later , she takes her fingers from her ears , I ask her , " Have you had experiences with others of your own kind before ? " <p> She nods . <p> " The scars . " <p> " Mmmnnn . " <p> " You were n't supposed to fight each other . " <p> " Mmnnnn . " <p> I want to comfort her . Put my arms around this green scaly thing . ( My son had an iguana . We never hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug , too . But even those little arms ... those claws .... . And my head could fit all the way in her mouth , no problem . I flinch away . I see her eyes turn reptilian - lose their wide childlike look . She says , " Kh ... khss sssorry . " <p> " No , it 's I who should be ... am sorry . " <p> I reach and I do hug and let myself be hugged . I get my parka ripped on her claws . Well , it 's not the first rip . <p> Far below us , the things fight and trumpet , smash trees , trample brush . I can see , even from up here , spit fly out . There 's no blood . Their hide is too tough . <p> They fight with their feet , leaping as cocks do . One is losing . It 's on its back , talons up . Even from way up here , I can see a little herd of panicked deer galloping off toward the hills . Rosie covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a stomachache . Says , " Mmmmm . Not Kkkh kkh krright . " <p> " What were you supposed to do ? " <p> " Kkh ... khill .... Mmmm those like kh you . Khill you . " <p> Below us , the creature that was on its back tries to escape but the others leap high and claw at it , pull it down , then one bites the under part of the neck . Now there is blood . <p> I turn to see Rosie 's reaction , but she 's not here . Then I see her , way , way back , curled up behind a tree . <p> I go back to her . I put my arm around her again . " Old buddy . " Then , " How did you ever turn out as you are ? " <p> " Mmmm mmistake . " Gh gho , " Rosie says , carefully not looking down at them . " Ghho . Mmmmnn ... mnnnow ! " And she 's already on her way , back to the shack . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , look like an afterthought . Obviously there 's a bit of the human in her . I see it in the legs , too . Also in those half-formed ears . <p> Those others below could push down my shack in half a minute . I need Rosie on my side . " Stay . I need you . I 'll push out a wall . I 'll make the door bigger . " <p> She stops , stares . I wish I knew what 's going on inside that big fierce head of hers . <p> " I 'll start getting the logs for it today . " <p> " I kh ... kh ... khelph . " <p> But my food wo food first . <p> " How have you lived all this time ? What have you eaten ? " <p> " Ghhophers mmm mostly . When mmmwere gh hophers . Khrabbits . When them . When kh llleaves , leaves . Mmmmushrooms . Rrrroots . Mmmmbark nnnot good but kh ate it . Khfish . Hhhard to kh kfish when kh h ice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . The streams up there are too fast to freeze over . She uses her foot . Hooks them on a claw . Her arms seem even too small to help with balancing . It 's her big green head and the half of her leftover tail , waving from side to side , that balances her as she reaches . She gets seven . <p> " Kkhfried ? " she says . " In khfat ? With khh kh corn mmmeal ? Like Mmmmmama ? Mushka ? " <p> " You betcha . You had a mama ? " <p> " Mmmmmnnnn . Mmmmmm . Mmone kh like mmyou . " <p> She bounces off down the . path ahead of me , singing an oolie , oolie , doodlie do kind of song . I guess she 's no longer sick . Or she 's too happy to care . And certainly not thinking about those others fighting in the valley . <p> ( I 'm carrying the fish . I strung them through their gills on to a willow stick . I had n't brought my stringer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting enough food for her . Yet she was starving . Perhaps she does n't like things raw ? ) <p> Back home we eat fried fish . I eat two and Rosie eats five . She watches as I cook just as the dog did , exact same expression , mouth half open . A dog sort of smile . We settle down afterward and I read to her from one of my books : Moby Dick . ( I only brought three . ) I read that to my son and wife , one on each side of me , and all of us on the couch . Rosie lies , head toward me , eyes almost shut , commenting now and then , her voice breathy , like one would imagine a snake would talk . I 'm sitting on my cot . We sip our rosehips tea . We 're both covered with blankets . <p> Then , " Time 's up , " I say . " You need sleep . " But she does n't want us to stop reading . " I insist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kread . You ssssleep . " She reaches for the book with those womanly shiny green fingers . I put it down and take her hand . " Ooobie baloobie , do it , " I say . ( Ooobie baloobie is another of her songs . ) She laughs . ( It 's more like panting than laughing , but so hard I think she must be little more than seven years old - her equivalent of seven- to think that 's so funny . ) But she settles down right after . Says , " Kh ... koh khay . " Wraps her little arms around herself . I tuck the blankets closer and douse the lamp with its lid . <p> This time I do n't worry if I might be her next meal , but I have a hard time sleeping anyway . I keep wondering what might happen if those others find my shack . They could break it down just leaning . on it by mistake . <p> Since they all seem to be coming down , we 'll go up . We 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the night there many a time . We 'll be all right as long as there is n't another storm that goes on for days and days . At least we 'll have fish . <p> I always did like camping out . The view is always worth more than the discomfort . Besides I do without right here every day . It never bothers me , washing up in a washbowl or an icy stream . Only here is it worth the bother of looking out the window . <p> Or now , at Rosie , too . She really is quite beautiful , her yellow underbelly and the darker green along the ridge of her back . She 's even reddish in spots . <p> Rosie hears them first , wakes me with her , " Kh ... kh ... kh . " There 's sounds of crashing through the brush . A tree splintering . From the look of the big dipper , straight out my little north window , it 's probably three or four A.M. <p> They 're coming closer . For sure they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . I hear them breathe and hiss . No , it 's only one , I think only one , pushing the wall on one side . The caulking falls out . Rosie braces herself against that wall to hold it . She picks up the rhythm of the other 's pushing , leans when it pushes . It works , the wall holds . At one point there 's a large hole where the caulking 's gone and I see the creature looking in - one light greenish eye like Rosie 's . The thing gives a throaty hiss . Rosie answers with the same hiss . It gives up . We hear it smashing away . We look at each other . <p> " You did it ! " <p> Rosie 's mouth is open in that smile that looks so much like my old Rosie 's and she nods yes so hard I 'm thinking she 'll put her neck out of joint . " Kh khdid ! Khdid ! " <p> " Pack up . We 'll go camp out up beyond where we fished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag of corn meal and puts them in her vest pockets . She 's still nodding yes but she stops when I tell her we have to bring blankets and a tarp . <p> " Kh ... kh . kh .... Kno ! Nnnnnooo ! " <p> " Yes ! It 's colder up there . You need shelter as much as I do . Maybe more so . " <p> Like Rosie , she gives up easily . " Kh .. kh-kho kay . " I do n't know what I 'd do if she did n't . She helps me roll the blankets in the tarp . Says , " I kh kcarry mmmmthat . " <p> I have to stop her from taking her books and her fancy green rock . She insists she can carry all the things we need and those too . <p> " I kh likhe ghrrrrreeeen . " <p> " That 's good . Then you like yourself . " <p> SHE STARTS UP , hop , skip , and jump ... even with all that to carry . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - even across talus . I keep telling her that stuff is unstable . " Dangerous even for you , " I say , but she does it anyway . The rocks do teeter , but she 's sure-footed . That leaping does n't last long , thank goodness . She does n't realize how much all that weight she 's carrying will tire her . I warned her , but since when do the young listen to warnings of that sort ? She 's jumped and skipped and leaped until now she lags behind and blows like a horse at every other step . I take the tarp and blankets from her . I 'd take that frying pan , too , but she wo n't let me . " Kh ... kan do it . I kan ! " <p> I do n't let Rosie stop until the halfway spot . " We 'll get up where we can see , " I say , " then we 'll rest . " <p> " Oh pf ... pfhooo , " she says , but she goes on , sighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more steps . " <p> A few minutes later we put down our bundles , Rosie takes off her vest , and we climb out to the edge of the scarp we just zigzagged up to see what we can see . And it 's as I feared , they 've found my cabin . Looks like there 's not much left of it already , walls pushed in , roof collapsed . I had doused the fire but there must have been some cinders left . A fire has started , at the cabin and on the ground around it . <p> She sits as I sit , legs hanging over . How much like a human she is . Sometimes you do n't see it at all , but in certain positions you do . Now she looks as if she 's going to cry . ( Can they cry ? Only humans , seals , and sea birds have tears . Anyway , you do n't need tears for sadness . ) I feel like crying , too . Rosie can tell just like my old Rosie could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least your stones are all right . " <p> She does n't even answer with an mmmnnnn . <p> I look to see if any trees are waving around down there from being bumped into , but there 's nothing . Odd . <p> After we start on up , Rosie is droopy , not only tired but sad . She thunks along . I feel sorry that she jumped and hopped so much in the beginning . My other Rosie was like that . She never realized she had to save her strength . <p> Most of my talking has been to keep her going . " Count steps . Maybe a hundred more . " " Come on , poor tired friend . " " See that rock ? We 'll stop just beyond that . " Now I mumble to myself - about when I 'll be back to sift through my things . I did n't bring any souvenirs of my wife and child . When I fled out here ... escaped ... I did n't even want pictures . I was running away from memories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just around the corner and we 'll be able to see the little lake I 'm heading for , the stepping stones crossing the creek that pours down from it , beyond , the trees and boulders where I had hoped to hide us this first night , but I decide we have to stop now . We stand .. that is , I stand , Rosie collapses . We 're both too tired to get out food other than jerky . I tuck Rosie in under an overhang . just her big back end with the half bitten off tail hanging out . I cover her with blankets and the tarp . She 's asleep before she can finish her jerky . I pick the chunk out of her mouth to save it for breakfast . <p> In the morning I wake to the sound of a helicopter . I know right away . Why .. why did n't I suspect before ? Rosie not only had an ear tag , but she has a chip imbedded in her neck . <p> There 's no place for a helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many boulders , but we 're not safe anyway . There could be more things in Rosie 's neck than just an ID chip . That could be why we did n't hear those creatures down there anymore . <p> Rosie 's in an exhausted sleep . " You have to wake up . Now ! I have to get your chip out . " I do n't mention what else might be there . Those others may have been disposed of ... without a trace , I 'll bet . Or little traces scattered all over the place so no one will know there ever were creatures like this . <p> " Did you know you have a chip ? " <p> I feel around Rosie 's neck . <p> " Hang on , friend , this will hurt . " <p> I do n't care about those others , but I 'd never like the forest without Rosie in it , skipping and hopping along , picking flowers , collecting green rocks or glittery fool 's gold , singing , " doodlie do " songs . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copter again , then back at me . Again it 's that : Should I be frightened or not ? Except now I 'm frightened . I try not to show it but she senses it . I see her getting scared , too . <p> The copter circles . I have to hurry - but I do n't want to hurt her but her skin is so tough ! And who knows , if I do find one or two things , will that be all that 's hidden there ? <p> " Hang on . " <p> She hugs herself with those inadequate arms . Even before I start she makes little doglike ... or rather , birdlike sounds . <p> " Sing , " I say . " Sing your oobie do . " <p> I feel two lumps . I dig in . I say , " Almost done , " when I 've hardly begun . <p> Then we run . Without our blankets , without our food , except what Rosie has in her vest . <p> " They ca n't follow now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old path that circles over the pass . We try to stay close to rocks and under what trees there are . Even running as we do , I ca n't not think about how beautiful it is up here . When I first saw it , years ago , I shouted when I came around the corner . <p> She 's way ahead of me in no time - those long strong legs . And we 're not carrying much of anything . I catch up when she finally turns to look for me . We both look back . The helicopter still hovers . I left the chip and button bullet back there at our camping spot . They think she 's still there . Maybe they do n't know about me . <p> She 's different from those others . What was she for ? That is , besides killing those like me ? <p> It starts to snow . Thank God or worse luck , I do n't know which . It 'll hide our tracks and the helicopter wo n't fly , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pass and dip into the next valley . We find a sheltered spot among a mass of fallen boulders where the whole side of a cliff came down . Some boulders are on top of each other making a roof . Boulders over , boulders under- not a particularly comfortable spot but we huddle there and rest . We take stock . All we have is what 's in Rosie 's vest , a little leftover jerky ( we eat it ) , the frying pan , and cornmeal . We can make corn cakes if we do n't catch fish . <p> This is just a mountain storm . If we can get far enough down we 'll walk out of it . If we 're lucky it 'll last just long enough to cover our tracks . I tell Rosie . She lies at my feet still panting . I stoke her knobby head . <p> " How 's your neck ? " <p> " Hh ... hoo khay . " <p> She sleeps . Murmuring a whole series of Mmmms and then , Mmmush , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rested , I wake her and we start down . After an hour we 're out of the snow and wind and into a hanging meadow . I 've been over this pass but not this far . <p> I 'm worried . Rosie is sluggish and dreamy , flopping along , tripping a lot . Poor thing , all she has on is her vest . She 's cold and with reptiles ... or part-reptiles .... I do n't want to build a fire but I must . The copter 's gone , maybe it 's all right to now . <p> " My poor fierce friend , " I say . She grins . I take her hand and sit her down . " We 're going to have a nice big fire . You rest . I 'll find the wood . " <p> I 'll hhh ... hhh ... hhh . " <p> " No you wo n't . I 'm going by myself . I 'll be back before you know it . " <p> She mews , turns away , and curls up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so not hard going . I gather brush , dead limbs , and drag the whole batch back to her , flop down , my arm around her . I see her eyes flicker , though the nictitating membrane closes as she does it . She does n't wake . I 'll have to make the fire right now . <p> How does a sick reptile show how sick it is ? All I know is , she does n't look right and does n't feel right . <p> I build the fire as close to her as I dare . Finally she seems in a more normal sleep . I sleep , too . <p> I wake with a start . Hibernate ! Do they ? All those others , too . But she 's been mixed with other genes . For sure , some human . <p> I wake her by mistake as I get out the frying pan and the cornmeal . I 'm melting snow , first to drink and then to make corncakes . She drinks as if she 's been out in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she sees what little cornmeal we have and says , " Mmmm nnnot ssso .... Nnnot hungry , " she says again . " Ooobie , baloobie , nnnnot . " <p> " Ooobie , baloobie , do eat me . Roll me in corn meal . I 'm old and I 'm tired . " <p> All of a sudden it 's not a joke . <p> " Kkkh kkkh ! Kh khca n't dog that ! Oooooh ! " <p> " I thought that 's what you were made for .. born for . " <p> " Kkh ca n't . " <p> " You 'll die . Look how thin you are . " <p> " I'mmm tem po rary . Temmm po po rary . " She sings it like a song  --  like she does n't care . Does she understand what it means ? I wonder if it 's true . Perhaps they all are - were . <p> " Mmmmmm all temmm po pol rary . " <p> " What makes you think you 're temporary ? " <p> " Mmmmush kh knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ! " <p> " Kkh kh nnnno ! I sssaw kher eyes . Sssscared . I kh khfound out . I kh ... kh ... kread . " <p> " You 're only half grown . " <p> " Have a kh kh tth timer . " <p> I do n't know what I see in those lizardy eyes of hers . " Do n't you like it here ? Do n't you care anything about being alive ? " <p> " Oh ! Kh ! Oooh ! Kh ! " She does a hopping , twisting dance , those tiny arms raised . It tells how she feels , better than her words ever could . <p> " Mmmmy kh heart , " she says , " hasss kth th timer . " <p> " How long is temporary ? " <p> " I sh should dannnce . Ssssing . Mnnnow ! And lllook . Lllook a Mot ! Yesssss ! Lottts . Mmm then kh kgo for goood mmmmbig bh bones . " <p> We 'll build another cabin . Here in this hanging valley , sheltered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With her help we 'll have one up in no time . We 'll dance and sing and look around a lot . At the smallest and the largest .. the near and the far .. stars , mountain peaks , beetles ... <p> " Every fifteen minutes it dashes around looking for the cheese .
