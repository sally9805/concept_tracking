During the past quarter century much has been written about the role of women , especially American women , in World War I. These studies cover an amazing variety of topics ranging from the role of women in the American Expeditionary Forces and in the international peace movements through discussions of the images of women in World War I movies and posters to work on the home front and behind enemy lines . Interestingly , women doing important diplomatic work have largely escaped attention : the stories of Vira Boarman Whitehouse , triumphant New York suffragist leader and Committee on Public Information director for Switzerland in 1918 , and Rosika Schwimmer , a prominent feminist turned diplomatic representative for Hungary between October 1918 and January 1919 , have each been treated to one single secondary account. 1 The discussion of their work requires further clarification , and at the same time , naturally lends itself to a comparative study . Following a loose chronological order , the present study surveys Whitehouse 's Swiss mission , describes the Whitehouse-Schwimmer relationship between 1914 and 1919 , and concludes with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole story in a broader context . <p> According to the 1918-1919 edition of the American Who 's Who , Vira Whitehouse was born in Virginia in 1875 , attended Wellesley College and then married Norman R. de Whitehouse of New York in 1898 . She joined the New York suffrage movement in 1913 , and emerged as its most prominent figure following the defeat of the suffrage amendment in the state in 1915 . She assumed the leadership , then they used the term " chairman , " of the New York State Suffrage Party and forced through the amendment by November 1917 . She did so with invaluable help from two prominent men who would later play a key part in her 1918 adventures : President Woodrow Wilson and CPI Chairman George Creel . <p> The Whitehouse-Wilson correspondence spans more than three years ( August 1915-October 1918 ) , and contains more than thirty letters , with the bulk of the material focussing on winning the right to vote for women in the State of New York . Their correspondence testifies to the fact that she was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won a couple of audiences with the chief executive in the process. 2 Clearly , Whitehouse was no unknown entity in the White House . Furthermore , Creel , one of Wilson 's closest , and most underestimated , advisors , had a high opinion of her : in his postwar memoir on the CPI he devoted an entire chapter to her work in Switzerland . After pointing out that it " was a new thing to place a woman in such a position of absolutely international importance , " Creel describes her appointment as both " wise and necessary . " He goes on to praise her for almost single-handedly reviving the cause of woman suffrage and taking it to its triumphant conclusion in her state. 3 Whitehouse had a gift for working relentlessly and for presenting her case with humor . She testified to the latter in a series of articles for the New York Sun in 1914 , called " Why Women Should n't Vote . " Perhaps more importantly , she openly condemned radical suffragists and , in the fall of 1915 , showed little interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 4 thus making herself acceptable to the Wilson administration , but also subject to accusations that she was short on patriotism. 5 And this explains Creel 's curious choice of the word , " necessary , " when describing her appointment : Creel felt that women deserved such a push , while Whitehouse needed a way to prove her loyalty to her country . Their accounts of the appointment itself authenticate this conclusion . <p> In December 1917 Whitehouse attended a woman 's suffrage convention in Washington , D.C. , and there she met Creel again . She proposed to do " some war-work , " and the CPI director was only too glad to enlist her . She points out in her memoir that they had actually worked together in New York in 1915 and that Creel vividly remembered it : " In fact , when he asked me to go he said it was because he remembered how hard I had made him work . I had slave-driven him , he said . " 6 In a predominantly male dominated society further irritated by Wilson 's style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an appointment was nothing short of daring . And trouble started even before Whitehouse left the country . <p> Creel was obviously aware of the possibility of being attacked on account of appointing a woman for such important war work , and they agreed to treat the matter confidentially . But when the news was leaked to the press an angry Secretary of State Robert Lansing publicly denounced Creel for proposing propaganda work abroad in general and for Whitehouse 's appointment in particular , only to eat his own words within a day. 7 This seemingly minor incident highlights one of the key problems Whitehouse would have to face in her work for her country , and , therefore , a brief bypass must be taken here to explain the complex relationship between Wilson , Lansing , Creel , Whitehouse and Mrs. Lansing . <p> Wilson had a tendency of handpicking his own representatives for official work and disregarding the government department that was supposed to do the job in question . The establishment of the CPI in early April 1917 , between asking for a declaration of war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first modern American ministry of propaganda in the European sense of the word , in a country that has , all through its history , distinguished itself from the " decadent old world " on the grounds of First Amendment rights . Although Creel supposedly shared its leadership with the Secretaries of State ( Lansing ) , War ( Newton D. Baker ) and Navy ( Josephus Daniels ) , he actually directed the organization alone . He was a muckraker journalist and long-time Wilson supporter , a veteran of two elections ( 1912 and 1916 ) , but a relatively unknown entity in Washington . The loud protests against his appointment in some important east coast papers suggest , at least to the present author , an element of jealousy on the part of his more prominent colleagues . While Baker and Daniels had no objections to Creel , Lansing saw yet another challenge to his curtailed licenses in the CPI . And jealousy flared up within the administration , too , when the president made it clear that the publication of diplomatic correspondence , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would now be the task of the CPI . Added to this was Mrs. Lansing 's openly anti-suffragist stand and her husband 's conservative New England background. 8 <p> What then actually happened in the final days of 1917 , the first report on the Whitehouse mission in the New York Times was published on the penultimate day of that year , was that Lansing found out about the appointment and , understanding its covert diplomatic nature , publicly challenged it . It was probably Wilson who made him withdraw the statement , thus spoiling the Whitehouse-State Department relationship once and for all. 9 The odds were heavily stacked against America 's first official woman pseudo-diplomat even before she left the United States : the State Department not only refused to grant her a diplomatic passport but it also continuously double crossed her , all that while Creel was being roasted in the papers and grilled in Congressional investigations during much of 1918 . And she was heading for a country notorious for its rejection of women 's issues ( and which granted woman suffrage only in 1971 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further evidence " that women could not be entrusted with such ( or any ) important work. 10 <p> Switzerland was the single most important neutral country in 1918 : it lay in the very heart of Europe , bordered on two Allied countries , France and Italy , and two Central Powers , Germany and Austria-Hungary , and had important newspapers in both French and German . Switzerland was at the crossroads of international diplomacy and public opinion in a way no other country in Europe has been in modern times . Accordingly , official international diplomatic representation in the capitol of Europe 's oldest republic grew from 71 in 1913 to 224 in 1919 . The American legation in Bern supervised no less than seven consulates , and its staff grew gradually as the war progressed . Charles Campbell came from Romania , Allen W. Dulles , of later CIA fame , from Vienna via Berlin , and Hugh Robert Wilson from South America via Berlin and Vienna . The joint representative of the American Red Cross and the War Trade Board was Ellis Loring Dresel , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separate German-American peace was signed in 1921 . Life in Switzerland was something special : pre-war friends now representing belligerent governments ate in the same restaurants and lived in the same hotels but refused to talk to each other , and international rivalries were confined to the " battle of the tennis courts , " a battle in which representatives of the two warring camps fought each other not on the courts but for the use of the courts . Entertainment and secrecy became the catch-phrases of life , while both sides tried to influence the public opinion of the other by articles printed in the Swiss press in the appropriate language. 11 Into this world came a rather attractive woman in her forties from New York 's highest circles , a woman who spoke little French and practically no German , and who refused to be entertained and wanted to work without secrecy . The American Minister Pleasant Alexander Stovall and his staff must have been puzzled . <p> Vira Whitehouse arrived in Switzerland on January 26 , 1918 and , in the absence of Minister Stovall , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legation . Wilson claimed no knowledge of her appointment nor of the very existence of the CPI , and went public with a cover story that she had gone to Bern to study the conditions of women and children , even before her arrival in the Swiss capitol . The legation staff tried to entertain her but made it clear from the start that she should expect no help form them . In the meantime , she established contacts with prominent Swiss newspapermen and liberal intellectuals , who called her attention to the strict Swiss neutrality laws , a lesson that she would learn and use later . After two frustrating months and learning all diplomatic means of biding time , she decided to return to the States and take up the issue with Creel and Wilson . The relevant chapters of her otherwise accurate and entertaining memoir radiate frustration over the contrast between the friendliness of the Swiss people and the unfriendliness of the American diplomats. 12 <p> She was fully aware of the fact that she was in a much better bargaining position on American soil than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that she still was the head of a powerful New York women 's organization might have made Creel more willing to take on Lansing . Like his boss , Stovall too lobbied vehemently with the president against her return , but she submitted a detailed project to her boss and Creel made up his mind . He played what must have been the final trump card : in conversations he emphasized the open nature of the CPI venture , something that Wilson appreciated well enough to mention it in a letter to Whitehouse before her second departure for Europe . With the rules of the game reset in her favor , she now even had a diplomatic passport , and with a much better CPI infrastructure in Europe to back her up , she returned to Switzerland in June 1918 and started actual work. 13 <p> In her memoir she describes the difficulties of launching a news service in wartime in an environment that is only partly supportive , and discusses the scope of her work in some detail . Her chief task was to provide accurate information on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news without violating the Swiss neutrality laws . She also worked with photographs , films and pamphlets , had many of Wilson 's speeches translated into German , and organized a visit for six Swiss journalists to the United States . Her effective work in Switzerland was confined to less than six months , and she departed for the United States on December 25 , 1918 , eleven months after setting foot on Swiss soil . Much to the relief of the American legation , she was replaced by Guy Croswell Smith , who stayed at his post until February 22 , 1919 , when the CPI office in Bern was closed down. 14 <p> Wolper points out that evaluating Vira Whitehouse 's work in Switzerland is no easy task . The State Department people obviously tried to present her in the worst possible light to the American public and the president alike . In her nine-page final report to Creel Whitehouse described her work but offered no definitive evaluation . Creel believed that she had done a great job , and cited the visiting Swiss journalists as proof : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they joined in declaring . It was never the case that we were pro-Germans , but rather that we did not know America . This was the knowledge she gave us , openly , honestly , and with rare intelligence . reaching the heart and mind of Switzerland in a manner never approached by the agent of any other country . ' " He then went on to describe her efforts on the basis of her memoir and reports , offering little if any further insight . Similarly , in his final report , Guy C. Smith simply stated that he continued Whitehouse 's work and cited several Swiss sources expressing their regret for the closing of the CPI offices in Bern. 15 <p> An overview of the known facts offers not only a more balanced evaluation of Vira Whitehouse 's work for the United States in Switzerland in 1918 but also insights into the more diplomatic aspects of her work . These are the basic facts to consider : She first arrived in Switzerland on January 26 , but was forced to delay the opening the CPI offices until July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of her own country , and the CPI financial resources were made available to her only on the last day of July . She had visited Switzerland as a tourist before the war more than once but she spoke only basic French and practically no German. 16 These factors combined for strict limitations on her work , while , at the same time , provide the framework in which her achievements should be assessed . <p> Her greatest achievements came in the field of distributing American news in the Swiss , especially the German Swiss , press . The Foreign Press Bureau of the CPI sent her daily news summaries through the diplomatic pouch and naval intelligence communications . These included two to five news items of forty to one hundred words each , and covered issues as diverse as the drinking habits of American soldiers , US loans to Romania , and a New York court decision to refuse the petition of a German-American citizen to change his name to something more American . More traditional news items covered American contributions to the Allied war effort as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A biweekly feature service summed up earlier news coverage and supplemented it with photographs and general material reminiscent of Sunday papers . With a masterstroke prompted by one of her associates , William B. Fife , she invited the Swiss authorities to censor American news items before they were distributed to the Swiss press , thus reducing German claims of abusive propaganda to the minimum . On October 8 , 1918 she reported to the CPI that 123 American articles had been printed . In her memoir she attributed the success of the news service to the following factors : ( 1 ) Allied victories in the field confirmed CPI reports on American war production , which had been described as exaggerated by the pro-German papers ; ( 2 ) her openly acknowledged goal of bringing about a better understanding between the American and Swiss peoples ; ( 3 ) attacks on prominent pro-German Swiss papers made them more willing to print American news to restore a semblance of impartiality ; and , most importantly ( 4 ) , the CPI was the only source of American news for both neutrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic and film propaganda , as well as with pamphlets , proved less convincing . Creel claimed that Whitehouse had filled the Swiss shop-windows with photographs , while she pointed out in her report that " this department was late in starting . " The chief sources of photographs were the CPI and the AEF in France , and she placed them in the papers and in special exhibitions . In a letter to Philip Holland of the American consulate in Basle on August 14 , she outlined the difficulties of pictorial propaganda : on one occasion she accepted the , rather high , price named by a Swiss photographer , but later he changed his mind and refused to do the job for her . Added to this was the difficulty of getting photo paper for printing . And she listed the same problems as late as October 25 , in a letter to Major A. L. James of the AEF. 18 This clearly indicates that photographic propaganda not only started late , it could not be carried out effectively . <p> Films presented Whitehouse with a different set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effectively in conjunction with the four-minute-men campaign . In Europe , and especially in Switzerland , the CPI had to play a whole different ballgame . The idea there was to show American propaganda movies with American feature films , but importing movies into Switzerland was not easy . Allied cooperation existed only on paper , and she was instructed to view and censor each film before releasing it to the public . This was another burden on Whitehouse , and she had no answer until as late as October 29 , when she decided to use Lieutenant Valentini of the AEF as her film censor . Thus , despite Creel 's claims to the contrary , film propaganda never took off in Europe 's oldest republic , not least because " the motion picture houses in Switzerland were almost continuously closed on account of the succession of epidemics of Spanish grippe. " 19 <p> As regards pamphlets , both Creel and Whitehouse claim successes in the field , but their statements again must be treated with caution . There was such a shortage of paper in Switzerland that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Furthermore , the first full set of CPI publications was mailed to her on August 17 , and Whitehouse 's reply dated a month later clearly shows that the material had not yet reached her by then . The scope of this work also remained limited : the CPI collection in the National Archives includes ten pamphlets for Switzerland : one on the supposed German-Bolshevik conspiracy , the rest translations of speeches by President Wilson . Nine of the ten pamphlets were printed only in German , the tenth was a bilingual English-German print of Wilson addresses. 20 10,000 copies of each pamphlet were run , they all bore the logo of the CPI , but , all in all , this was far from impressive for a five-month campaign . The very fact that these pamphlets were printed in German suggests that her primary target was not the Swiss , but the German public . <p> Similarly , Vira Whitehouse 's pet project of sending six prominent Swiss journalists to the United Sates came to naught , partly because of delays but also because their reports reached home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armistice had not come before their return to Switzerland , their stories and accounts would have had a significant place in hurrying the end of the war , " she lamented later. 21 If anything , they provided much needed ammunition for a battered Creel in the Congressional hearings in the fall of 1918 , when he tried to justify the various aspects of his work . <p> From a strictly propagandistic point of view , Vira B. Whitehouse put in a successful effort but , for reasons often beyond her control , fell well short of the ambitious plans she had outlined to George Creel and President Wilson in May 1918 . That notwithstanding , she provided further important intelligence and semi-diplomatic services to her country , thus making her European mission a success beyond any reasonable doubt . <p> As has been emphasized before , the Whitehouse mission had a diplomatic overtone from the very start . After all , she was going to the diplomatic crossroads of Europe to win a propaganda war in neutral as well as in enemy countries . She was continuously in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Wilson 's secret negotiator in Switzerland , George D. Herron , to President Calonder of the Swiss republic . Her propaganda work was nothing short of what we now call cultural diplomacy , and the State Department personnel 's obstructionism suggests an understanding that her appointment was an infringement on their licenses. 22 Being in touch with American and Swiss diplomats may have been officially on the cards , but Whitehouse 's contacts with American military intelligence as well as with the Hungarian diplomat Rosika Schwimmer represent a quite different dimension of her work . <p> Her wartime records and postwar memoirs make it quite clear that Vira Whitehouse never thought of herself as a diplomat , in fact , she developed an " us and them " attitude towards the official diplomatic representatives of her country , in response to the way they treated her . She , furthermore , rejected secrecy and claimed to have had no part in any secret , covert venture , but the secretive atmosphere of Bern did not leave her fully untouched. 23 She repeatedly supplied the American military attach in Bern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss press , German propaganda in Switzerland , and on the illegal trafficking of movies into Germany . On August 16 Colonel Churchill of the General Staff requested information on the pro-German press in Switzerland , and his request was forwarded to the CPI offices in Bern by George Howe , the assistant military attache , who did not even realize that he was dealing with a woman . In response , he received a detailed , three-page analysis of the situation from Whitehouse . She also supplied sensitive information for the AEF : on October 5 she informed Captain Donald McPhearson , the AEF purchasing agent in Switzerland , about Italian projects to thwart President Wilson 's plans . Furthermore , she was in touch with General D. Nolan , chief of the intelligence section of the General Army Headquarters in France and with Colonel R. H. Van Deman , another high ranking intelligence officer of the AEF. 24 <p> On one occasion it was the State Department that got her involved in a secret project . In a memo dated August 6 , 1918 Hugh Wilson informed her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Switzerland , on a CPI mission to work with the Lithuanian National Council . She was instructed to work with him , and this cooperation lasted until at least early November. 25 Clearly , providing intelligence reports and dealing with secret agents for a good cause did not qualify as covert action . And the real test of loyalties and principles was yet to come in the shape of a special relationship with another feminist , Rosika Schwimmer , who now represented a defeated enemy power , Hungary . <p> Unlike Whitehouse , Schwimmer , whose real name is Rza BdySchwimmer , was a well-known feminist and suffragist . Born into a Jewish Hungarian family , she , together with Vilma Glcklich , single-handedly created the non-militant , non-socialist wing of the Hungarian suffrage movement and became its chief spokesperson even before the war . She masterminded the ill-fated Ford Peace Ship , and worked towards the peaceful resolution of the war . She seemed a logical choice to represent the new bourgeois liberal government of Count Michael Krolyi , and interestingly , she arrived in Bern a day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her credentials for the job were impressive : she spoke nine languages , knew several European heads of state in person , and was received twice by President Wilson , who was the number one hope of the Hungarians , on account of his Fourteen Points . Krolyi believed that he could pitch his high hopes on her , and forced her official appointment through the Hungarian National Council , actually his own government , despite loud protests from some of his associates. 26 And he could not be more wrong . <p> True , she was a personal acquaintance of Wilson , but she was also persona non grata in the Wilson White House . Following their 1914 meeting she gave an unauthorized interview to the American press , disclosing details of their discussion . Her next reception was granted as a courtesy to Jane Addams , and was delayed considerably . Her participation in the Ford expedition may have looked good on her resume , but , especially after the sinking of the Lustiania , it hardly endeared her to American decision makers . Furthermore , her association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted first the British , then the Americans to describe her as a socialist. 27 This got even worse in Switzerland in November 1918 , when she was accused of being a Bolshevik , a claim that made it even into American historical writing. 28 Of course she never was , her most prominent American contacts included Jane Addams , Carrie Chapman Catt and Emily Greene Balch , none of whom represented any serious left wing challenge to American democracy . <p> Schwimmer 's odds were probably worse than those of Whitehouse . Hungary was in turmoil , and Krolyi 's control of the situation well short of satisfactory . Various domestic conservative and radical groups were challenging him publicly , and the newly created " successor states " of the Habsburg Monarchy were attacking Hungary for additional territorial gains , all that with thinly veiled French support . His decision to send Schwimmer to Bern was as brave as Creel 's one to send Whitehouse overseas , and he too was challenged from within the circles of his closest associates . Furthermore , Schwimmer generated controversy in a way no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbingly confident in herself . In addition , Krolyi 's domestic opponents also realized the potential advantages of securing Allied attention in Switzerland , and Bern was flooded by real and self-appointed Hungarian diplomatic representatives . And since the Allies refused to recognize Krolyi 's administration as the official representative of the new Hungary , Schwimmer had no way to authenticate her claim that she really represented her native land. 29 Finally , she was heading for Switzerland , a country still unfavorably disposed towards women and , not least due to Whitehouse 's efforts , more neutral in thought than in action . It remains one of the mysteries of Hungarian history why she , alone in the world fully aware of all the above facts , accepted the mission . <p> Whitehouse and Schwimmer had known each other from before the war . Whitehouse first heard the Hungarian speak at an American suffrage convention in 1914 . Then , as a delegate to the Women 's International Congress at the Hague in April 1915 , Whitehouse opposed a key resolution proposed by Schwimmer . Back in the States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , which , as has been indicated above , earned her the support of the White House . Obviously , no ill-feelings remained , and , on finding out about the American 's mission , Schwimmer called on Whitehouse in Bern and asked her to put her in touch with Colonel House , who she knew now was in France . Whitehouse promptly introduced Schwimmer to Hugh Wilson and Colonel Godson , thus making it possible for the new , democratic Hungary to have her voice heard for the one and only time before the Coolidge mission set up shop in Vienna in January 1919. 30 <p> At the same time , President Wilson decided to send an appeal to the peoples of Austria-Hungary , and Whitehouse was instructed to translate the message into all the languages of the Habsburg Monarchy and distribute it to the widest possible audience . Under these circumstances it seemed quite natural for her to seek Schwimmer 's help in the matter . Following a car ride which is cut out for a Hollywood movie , the mission was accomplished . It earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trouble for Whitehouse. 31 Both the American legation in Bern and the military intelligence division of the AEF thought that using , and encouraging , Schwimmer was not a good idea , partly because some Swiss papers described the Hungarian as a Bolshevik , but , perhaps more importantly , because it created the impression that the Wilson administration supported Karolyi - an option the American president never seriously considered . But despite repeated warnings and protest from American diplomats and intelligence officers , Whitehouse , and then her successor , Guy C. Smith , remained in touch with Schwimmer and promptly forwarded all information acquired from her to the authorities. 32 In response , first Hugh Wilson , then Minister Stovall broke relations with the Hungarian envoy , which resulted in a most moving , six-page letter from " the modern world 's first woman ambassador " to the first official woman semi-diplomat of the United States . In this unique document of not only women 's studies but also of World War I diplomacy , Schwimmer recites their contact and co-operation , her attempts to reach Colonel House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rejects the charges of Bolshevism , describes Hungary 's difficulties , and asks her American friend to explain the situation to her. 33 While Whitehouse 's reply has not been preserved , her correspondence with Colonel Van Deman testifies to the fact that she was unwilling to go along with the official American position : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Needless to say , neither her memoirs nor unpublished American sources carry " anything definite " against Schwimmer . Yet handling Schwimmer , an enemy representative , confronted Whitehouse with a moral dilemma she was unable to settle by herself before her departure for the United States on Christmas Day , 1918 . <p> Schwimmer 's papers in the New York Public Library reveal her gradual isolation and growing frustration . In a later letter to Krolyi , Schwimmer claimed that she was allowed to borrow Whitehouse 's car , that her own car was borrowed by American diplomats , and that she was called on to brief an American mission before its departure for Hungary. 35 While All this is probably true , what really happened in Switzerland was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her letters to Colonel House went unanswered , and she lost touch with Colonel Godson , too . Her only other contact with American diplomats came around the turn of the year , when an American mission headed by Alonzo E. Taylor of the American Relief Administration convened in Bern and asked her to provide them with information about Hungary . The focus of her work gradually shifted from diplomatic to propaganda issues , with much of her energies tied down in attempts to challenge lies directed at her and Krolyi 's new Hungary. 36 <p> For reasons the discussion of which would go much beyond the scope of the present study , the Allies decided not to hear Hungary 's case and used Schwimmer 's being a woman as a cheap excuse to force her resignation on January 18 , 1919 . To add insult to injury , Stovall made it quite clear that his dislike of the Hungarian diplomat partly stemmed from the fact that she was of Jewish stock . Despite her own and Krolyi 's published statements , Schwimmer 's diplomatic mission was a clear-cut failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any realistic chance of success : in a hostile environment she was unable to establish herself as the chief spokesperson for Hungary and was recalled on the request of Swiss President Calender. 37 <p> The story of Vira Boarman Whitehouse 's semi-diplomatic mission to Switzerland in 1918 and her cooperation with Rosika Schwimmer in November-December 1918 is a story of coincidences . Having just won the battle for woman suffrage in New York and in need of an opportunity to demonstrate her patriotism , Whitehouse happened to be in Washington exactly when Creel was looking for someone to send to Switzerland . Creel happened to be the only member of Wilson 's closest circle who would appoint a woman to such a key position , and he happened to be in the fighting mood when the State Department 's obstructions forced Whitehouse to return to the United States in April-May 1918 . Whitehouse , a relatively unknown entity in the international women 's movement , happened to remember , and be remembered by , Schwimmer , and they happened to meet in Bern when they needed each other . And Whitehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stronger stand on behalf of Schwimmer , and , indirectly , of Hungary . <p> It is also the story of irony and cruel twists of fate . Ironically , they were both given a hard time by their own fellow countrymen in Switzerland . They both offered to resign and had their resignation turned down by their respective bosses for the same reason : publicly admitting the failure of their female appointees would have weakened their domestic position further . Wolper points out that Creel and his staff were sensitive enough to provide Whitehouse with additional emotional support . Schwimmer 's relations with Krolyi were more formal . On one occasion he she remarked in a letter to State Secretary Lajos Br of the Foreign Ministry that he was the only one who ever replied to her and she was wondering whether her reports ever reached Krolyi. 38 Whitehouse experienced no such problems . And it is a most cruel twist of fate that Schwimmer , the first modern woman minister from a relatively unimportant country , Hungary , came to be remembered despite the failure of her mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to be forgotten despite the obvious success of her mission . This I find quite surprising since with the benefit of twenty-twenty hindsight it is fair to say that in the long process of emancipation in the diplomatic profession in the United States , George Creel 's decision to appoint Vira B. Whitehouse to Switzerland , together with her successful tour of duty , ranks as high as President Clinton 's decision , sixty-odd years later , to appoint Madeleine Albright as America 's first woman secretary of state . <p>
