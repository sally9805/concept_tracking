The war for the White House rages on in overtime <p> The blow was hard  --  and , some would say , low . Last Saturday the Bush campaign trotted out the governor of Montana , the normally mild-mannered Marc Racicot , to make an incendiary charge . " Last night we learned how far the vice president 's campaign will go to win this election , " Racicot said . " The vice president 's lawyers have gone to war in my judgment against the men and women who serve in our armed forces . " The Bushies accused the Democrats of running a dirty campaign to disallow the absentee ballots of soldiers and sailors stationed abroad . Chiming in was Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf , the hero of the gulf war , who had just returned from a hunting trip with his old commander in chief , former president George Bush . " It is a very sad day , " said the general , when soldiers facing " danger on a daily basis " can not vote because of some " technicality . " <p> Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election , the Bush forces had seemed outgunned and outsmarted by the Gore campaign in the war for Florida 's decisive 25 electoral votes . On Friday , Bush appeared to be losing the legal and PR battle in Florida . The state Supreme Court blocked the pro-Bush secretary of State , Katherine Harris , from certifying the votes that would have awarded Bush victory . A U.S. court of appeals denied a Bush motion challenging the hand recount as unconstitutional . Dade County , with more Democratic than Republican votes , decided to begin its own manual recount . And in Broward County , a local judge gave election officials more leeway in counting votes that were likely to favor Gore . The vice president 's flying squad of superlawyers  --  including Microsoft-slayer David Boies and Harvard Law 's media-friendly constitutionalist Laurence Tribe  --  were everywhere , filing papers and talking fast . Now , by wrapping their cause in the flag , Bush 's surrogates escalated a strange struggle that was growing at once more intense and more bizarre . <p> In some ways , the Bush blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All through the fall of 1999 , Bush seemed to be sleepwalking toward the GOP nomination , confidently predicting victory but doing little to earn it . Surprised by John McCain in New Hampshire , Bush woke up and waged a bitter , low-road campaign in South Carolina . Last weekend 's counterattack on Gore had some of the feel of Bush 's ferocious assault on McCain  --  an all-out attack , usually through surrogates , on the Vietnam War hero 's integrity . It was an interesting coincidence that the same behind-the-scenes operator who ran Bush 's campaign in South Carolina  --  Warren Tompkins , a disciple of the late GOP hit man Lee Atwater  --  was back on the scene . Tompkins was stationed in Tallahassee last week , helping to mount the counterattack against the Democrats for disenfranchising the military . <p> Until last weekend , it was the Gore campaign that seemed to be playing harder and shrewder . Operating out of a small , unprepossessing law office in Tallahassee , fitted just last week with high-speed T-1 lines , Gore 's lawyers were busily trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Breakfasting on Krispy Kreme doughnuts and doing their own typing and Xeroxing , these expert hired guns were trying to extract a Gore victory from the bewildering chaos of Florida 's anarchic election system . In one sense , the Democrats were playing on their own turf : the Party of Trial Lawyers is expert at filing lawsuits and winning them . In the down-and-dirty struggle for the PR high ground , the Democrats seemed to be taking their cue from Al Gore himself . Be relentless . Sound moralistic ( while acting partisan ) . Never let up . By contrast , Governor Bush had seemed oddly listless , cocooned on his Texas ranch . But the GOP candidate showed in the nomination fight and the general election that he has a way of drifting along  --  and then suddenly , back to the wall , lashing out . <p> Would it ever end ? By Saturday night , with the machine vote tally completed and the counting of absentee ballots from overseas still in turmoil , Bush led Gore by 930 votes . The Gore forces were hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand recount of some 1.5 million votes in counties that went nearly 2-1 for the vice president . The Gore votes were only trickling in during the early going , and some Gore-ites were anxiously beginning to wonder if the new votes would add up to a majority after all . Both sides were pondering stratagems and scenarios that would throw the results into further confusion and , perhaps ultimately , into the House of Representatives . <p> At some point , one of the candidates would have to play the statesman and call it quits . But for now , the public seemed reasonably patient . In the NEWSWEEK Poll , only 12 percent of Americans characterized the situation in Florida as a " crisis , " and two thirds said that the TV networks have made the impasse appear like a bigger crisis than it really is . Americans were interested in the battle for Florida , but more as an entertaining curiosity than a struggle that will deeply affect their lives . For many cable-TV addicts , " Decision 2000 " was more gripping than , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Simpson trial . <p> Like any good soap opera , this one was full of colorful characters and behind-the-scenes maneuvering . While both candidates repeatedly intoned that they wished to do what was right for the country , their minions were doing whatever it took to win . Florida has always had a high tolerance for eccentricity and a rich tradition of hardball politics , and both were on vivid display last week . " Weirdness is so ubiquitous here that people just shrug their shoulders and live with it , " said journalist Eliot Kleinberg of The Palm Beach Post . " I 'm not even surprised this happened here . I expected it to happen in Florida . " <p> The star of the show , Katherine Harris , looked as if she had stepped off the set of " Dynasty . " Tastefully bejeweled , usually heavily made up , Harris , 43 , had turned a largely ceremonial post  --  secretary of State  --  into a kind of roving cultural ambassadorship . The granddaughter of a citrus baron , she once said she wanted to transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Criticized in the local press for junketing ( she spent more than $100,000 on travel her first two years on the job ) , Harris is known for her ambition and toughness . She was " passionately interested , " she said , in a real ambassadorship  --  in a new Bush administration . The Democrats tried to make a mockery of her as a Bush flunky . Reporters received a three-page dossier on her background , pointing out that she was Bush-Cheney co-chairman in Florida and had even trudged through the snows of New Hampshire campaigning for Bush . Gore spokesman Chris Lehane called her a " hack " and " commissar . " Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz , one of the battery of Democratic lawyers who descended on Florida , called her a " crook , " and former Clinton aide Paul Begala said she looked like " Cruella De Vil coming to steal the puppies . " <p> Harris presented herself as a lone but resolute figure caught in the vortex . " She was acutely aware of the historical ramifications of her decision , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever I do , I 'm going to get hammered . " She let it be known that she had at no time spoken with her boss , Gov . Jeb Bush , who has recused himself . When the time came to ponder whether to allow the manual recount to go forward or exercise her " discretion " under the law to certify the final vote , she cleared her office  --  overflowing with flowers and bouquets from admirers and supporters  --  of all aides and hangers-on . She needed to be alone , she said . When her advisers returned , however , they included a powerful local lawyer-lobbyist with unusually close ties to Jeb Bush : J. M. ( Mac ) Stipanovich , also known as Mac the Knife . After last year 's session of the state legislature , Stipanovich , who represents Big Sugar , among other interests , was overheard telling Jeb Bush , " I got everything . I do n't know what the poor people got . But the rich people are happy , and I 'm ready to go home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed to NEWSWEEK that Stipanovich was advising Harris as an " old family friend . " ( Stipanovich refused to comment . ) <p> The Republicans were n't the only ones with apparent conflicts of interest . Even as the Democrats were complaining about Harris 's serving as a front woman for Bush , the state 's Democratic Attorney General Bob Butterworth  --  the state chairman of the Gore campaign  --  was using his official position to advance the Gore cause . Or so the Republicans charged . When a state official working for Harris ruled that local election boards had no legal authority to recount votes by hand , Butterworth countered with a memo insisting that they did . A Volusia County judge , Michael McDermott , told NEWSWEEK that he challenged the attorney general  --  who was calling the Volusia County election board by speakerphone  --  about his role . " Mr. Butterworth , " asked Judge McDermott , " in what capacity are you calling us ? " Butterworth at first replied , " As the attorney general of Florida , " prompting McDermott to point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Gore . " According to McDermott , Butterworth replied , " Well , I was , but that 's over . " Recalled McDermott : " I almost laughed when he said that . " At McDermott 's insistence , Butterworth got off the conference call . " You could hear the door slamming , " recalled the judge . <p> There were a few individuals who seemed to rise above the partisan bickering . In Palm Beach County , Judge Jorge Labarga found himself confronted with one of the most maddening issues of the vote recount . On many of the ballots , the chad had not been punched all the way through the hole , or even torn , but merely indented . Should such a " dimpled " or " pregnant " chad be counted as a vote ? If Labarga said yes , he would be boosting Al Gore , who stood to gather more votes in Democratic Palm Beach . Labarga had raised $100,000 for Jeb Bush in 1994 . But after bringing order to a chaotic courtroom ( " Did anybody in Florida not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench ) , Labarga decided to allow Palm Beach to count the dimpled ballots . Labarga , whose father had fled Castro 's Cuba , later said , " The right to vote to me is as precious as life itself . " <p> The Democrats immediately heralded Labarga as a profile in courage . But his decision underscored the chaotic and at times absurd nature of the vote count that straggled along last week . Left without any new standard , the Republicans argued , the vote counters would have to go through every ballot to determine , chad by chad , the intent of each voter . In neighboring Broward County , on the other hand , officials were counting votes only if the chad had been ripped at two corners , thereby excluding votes that would count in Palm Beach County . Only late in the week did a Broward County judge step in and adopt the more expansive " dimpled chad " standard . Behind " crime scene " police tape in a grim concrete bunker  --  a hurricane shelter  --  the Palm Beach vote counters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner , Carol Roberts , 64 , who has a gravelly smoker 's voice and a Gore-Lieberman sticker on her car , had announced that she was " willing to go to jail " in defiance of Harris 's order to stop counting ballots by hand . " Go , girl ! " cried her backers in the noisy crowd outside . All week , a mishmash of riled-up senior citizens , union agitators and even a few white supremacists waving Confederate flags marched and shouted for the cameras . " Dimpled babies , not chads ! " read one placard . <p> The tumult was too overwhelming for Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane . When a local radio reporter followed him into a men 's room at the Palm Beach airport and thrust a mike in his face as he stood at the urinal , Lehane decided to retreat to Washington . Still , the Democrats seemed to warm more easily to this roiled scene than the Bush campaign . The Democratic machine in Massachusetts parachuted dozens of veteran operatives , from Kennedy aides to the deputy mayor of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county buildings , they set up shop in a dented , rusted-out Winnebago  --  " something out of ' The Partridge Family ' , " joked one  --  across the street . Ron Klain , the Gore-ites ' legal captain , tapped his old professor from Harvard Law , Larry Tribe , to fashion constitutional arguments . The big Democratic catch was David Boies , possibly the best trial lawyer in the country . Dressed in his trademark black knit tie and inexpensive blue suit , the man who successfully sued to break up Microsoft for the Justice Department was racing from court to court and camera to camera last week , spinning and arguing with disarming charm , while rushing out three times a day for his favorite snack , frozen yogurt . Diet magnate Daniel Abraham , the chairman of Slim-Fast and a major Democratic donor , provided his private jet to ferry around the Democrats ' legal team . <p> In her cramped , over-air-conditioned office at Republican National Committee headquarters , Barbara Comstock watched the Gore juggernaut with alarm . During the campaign , Comstock and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady stream of e-mails documenting Gore 's exaggerations and " lies . " More than anyone , Comstock 's team had succeeded in establishing Gore 's reputation as a truth-stretcher . Comstock 's group pestered the Bush campaign to fight harder . But the Austin Powers had always scoffed at the free advice coming from Washington , and seemed a little slow to react to the severity of Gore 's challenge in Florida . Not until the Thursday after the election did Bush get his own superlawyer , Theodore Olson , on a plane to Florida . A close friend of Monica Lewinsky prosecutor Ken Starr 's , Olson is a hardened veteran of Washington 's partisan legal wars . His clients include Ronald Reagan and , briefly , Starr 's chief witness in the Whitewater controversy , Judge David Hale . His wife , Barbara , is well known as a fearsome blond right-wing TV pundit . By the time Olson entered the fray , his options were limited . He challenged the manual recount in federal court , but his odds of success were always long : federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election matters like ballot counts . By midweek , a weary Olson was back on a plane to Washington , to get fresh clothes for the long siege and feed his dogs ( one of whom is named Ronald Reagan ) . <p> Some local Republican operatives were disheartened . " Of course I 'm frustrated . They 've outsmarted us , " groused Reeve Bright , chief counsel to the Palm Beach County Republican Party . Republicans were n't playing hardball like the Democrats , he complained , and had muffed a chance to pick up votes by failing to demand hand counts in counties with a GOP edge . ( The Republicans had missed the deadline of 72 hours after the polls closed . ) Bright dismissed the Republicans ' legal challenge in federal court as too little , too late . " I was talking to one of our guys up there in Tallahassee , and he said to me , ' This will muss up their hair . ' I said to him , ' Muss up their hair ? Are you kidding ? They 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Bright wanted to fight " fire with fire . " He had come across evidence that the crusty , tough-talking Carol Roberts , one of the three commissioners on the board overseeing the vote , had been soliciting campaign contributions for the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate , Bill Nelson . He had a letter from Roberts to a local businessman stating that she had the " distinct honor " to host a Nelson fund-raiser . Bright was ecstatic : a provision in the local election code appears to bar election overseers from being " active participants " in any election they might have to certify . Bright wanted to go to court to disqualify Roberts . But up in Tallahassee , the GOP legal honchos said no . They did n't want to seem to be taking " the low road , " said Bright . He complained that he could n't even get the Bush campaign on the phone . The Bush lawyers were too busy writing high-minded legal briefs , he said , while the Gore forces were all over Palm Beach . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bright . " They ought to know where the booty is . " <p> How long  --  and how hard  --  to fight for the " booty " ( the votes ) is up to the candidates themselves . According to one top Gore campaign operative , the " hardest of the hard-liners are the two candidates , " Gore and Lieberman . The two men , who somewhat ostentatiously took their wives to see the new movie " Men of Honor " last week , seem to be relishing the fight . Gore has set up a war room in the dining room of the vice president 's mansion . On Thursday , he came up with a showy gambit to seize the moral high ground . Gore is a close reader of The New York Times editorial page , which has been advocating a statewide recount and a public summit between the two candidates to reassure the nation . Gore decided to go on national TV  --  right in the middle of the nightly news  --  and offer a deal : he would drop all lawsuits if Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He called for a good-will meeting with Bush and generally did his best to appear statesmanlike . The offer was an old Gore ploy : propose a reasonable-sounding deal you 're sure your opponent will reject . ( He had done the same with Bill Bradley during the primaries , suggesting they forgo 30-second ads and debate every week . ) When Gore was done , he went back to work , phoning the editorial-page editor of The Miami Herald to personally press his case . ( Tom Fiedler was so disbelieving that he had the veep on the line that he almost hung up . Gore had to put Tipper on the line to convince him . ) <p> Down in Texas , Bush seemed to be caught off guard by Gore 's offer . He was out at his beloved 1,500-acre ranch and had to drive nearly two hours back into Austin to face the cameras . After saying no to Gore , he got right back into his car and headed out to the ranch . He sleeps better there , his aides say . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to architect David Heymann , Bush 's no-nonsense wife , Laura , had one guiding caution : " Is it pretentious ? " Friends said the Bushes have taken a calm " if it 's meant to happen ... " approach to the waiting game . During a recent interview with NEWSWEEK , Laura explained , " Both of us have a lot of peace about our lives . " On election night , when a pool reporter asked Bush how it felt to have his future in the balance , he quickly corrected , " My whole future is n't on the line . " Asked the same question about his brother , Jeb Bush reiterated the point . " My brother 's life is in good shape , " he said . <p> Was Bush preparing himself for defeat ? The appearance was deceiving . The Bush counter-attack came during a brief lull . On Saturday , lawyers stopped wrangling and turned to the most important local contest , the Florida-Florida State football game . Gore campaign chairman Bill Daley had time to go to his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called talking-head parish , because Chris Matthews , Mark Shields and Pat Buchanan occupy the pews ) . " I got a million cousins coming in , " said a weary Daley . <p> Meanwhile , the Bush campaign was gearing up for an offensive . On Friday , Bush operatives got hold of military . Many letters home from military bases lacked postmarks . Most of these ballots were thrown out . The Bushies began to sense Democratic mischief when Duval County , with a large military population serving abroad , was slow to report its absentee ballots . When the Bush vote turned out to be much lower than expected in the morning , the Bushies launched their counterstrike . Governor Racicot , a former Army prosecutor , was chosen precisely because he was normally so amiable . When he re-entered the office at Bush headquarters Saturday afternoon after delivering his blast at the Democrats for disrespecting the armed forces , Bush aides stood and applauded . <p> What was Bush 's role ? Candidates are supposed to keep their distance from their more hard-edged surrogates . But Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together Friday night . At dinner , it was Racicot who pushed Bush to take the evidence of voting abuses to the public . Bush turned to an aide and asked , " Why is n't he out there ? " The Montana governor was said to be in line for a high post in a Bush administration . Racicot has endeared himself to Bush by being loyal  --  Bush 's favorite quality  --  and by being low-key . Indeed , the TV networks generally avoid Racicot because he 's not enough of a flamethrower . That may change : Sunday morning he was scheduled to appear on ABC 's " This Week . " <p> The battle was set to rage on this week on a number of fronts , all contentious and all important to the outcome . The Florida Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments on whether Harris abused her " discretion " by trying to cut off the hand counts in the three heavily Democratic counties . Florida 's high court is stocked exclusively with Democratic appointees , and it has a reputation for liberal activism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing that the judges are almost sure to approve hand counts . Why else would they be letting the vote go ahead , he asked , if they did not mean for the votes to be counted ? But it also seemed possible that the judges wanted to watch the process work before rendering a judgment . If it took too long or seemed too unfair , the judges might have to throw out the manual recount  --  or , possibly , go the other way and order a statewide recount . <p> The early indications were that counting the three counties could take weeks , not the six to 10 days originally forecast . The pace was excruciatingly slow . Democratic operatives were accusing the Republicans of intentionally stalling and staging stunts , like getting the Sheriff 's Office to sweep up loose chad on the floor to somehow suggest ballot tampering . Reports from Miami-Dade were that the county could take two to four weeks to recount its 654,000 votes . Challenges will abound : last week The Miami Herald reported that 39 convicted felons in Miami-Dade and Broward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats . The newspaper interviewed a 50-year-old woman with a 15-year jail sentence for cocaine dealing who not only voted but served as a poll watcher . The Democrats were accusing Republican state officials of improperly helping absentee voters fill out their ballots , while Bush spokesman Karen Hughes was accusing the Democrats of distorting and sabotaging the vote count . Even if the Florida Supreme Court resolved these questions , the losers could appeal to the United States Supreme Court . While the justices would be reluctant to overrule the state court , they might conceivably step in if they believed a U.S. president had been chosen in a starkly unfair manner . The chaos and slow grinding of the legal gears raised the possibility that Florida would fail to finish by Dec. 18 , the date every state 's electors must cast their votes in the Electoral College . What if Florida 's 25 electors had n't been chosen ? Would the Florida state legislature get into the act ? Would the election be thrown to the House of Representatives , a possibility under the U.S. Constitution ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Congress convenes in January , " said Lloyd Cutler , a lawyer who is known as one of the last Wise Men of the old Washington establishment . " It 's like the Abbott and Costello skit  --  who 's on first ? " Cutler was already reading the law books to see what happens if the election winds up in Congress , a process no more certain to bring order and fairness than the workings of the Florida county election commissions . Eventually , America will have a new president . He may not have much of a mandate , and some , including foreign friends and foes , may question his legitimacy . But the republic will not fall . In the meantime , Americans were being treated to a heck of a show . Tracking Hurricane 2000 <p> THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION bounced through a dizzying array of courts last week-and it is n't over . Judges handed down lightning-quick decisions on manual recounts while the campaigns ' lawyers and spinners dueled in daily press conferences . Here 's who was hot and who was cold as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Secretary of State Katherine Harris says she will enforce a deadline of 5 p.m .
