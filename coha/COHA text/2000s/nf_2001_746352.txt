The mandate for journalists is to " get " the story from sources with diverse , sometime inimical interests . Most news stories are negotiated in defined social contexts among many different actors , including sources , journalists , editors and press agents . Much of this negotiation occurs in an unwriteable register . Such discourse is thus a key site for looking at interpretive agency in newswriting . Speech labeled " off-the-record " is but one of several modes of discourse that are unwriteable in journalistic practice . In this article I examine a case study of journalistic practice , and the efforts I , as a journalist , engaged in to " get " the story from political actors who shift on and off the record while seeking to further their own practical agendas . I fallow the conversations with situated political actors , both on and off the record , as the journalist attempts to move , both socially and textually , from unwriteable speech to a writeable story . <p> discourse ; interpretive practice ; journalism ; knowledge ; United States <p> There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 , 1978a , 1978b ; Rosenblum 1979 ; Fishman 1980 ; Gans 1980 ; Gitlin 1983 ; Pedelty 1995 ) but it is to a large extent embedded in a particular critique of the American media-industrial complex 1 which treats journalism primarily as an institutionally structured activity . In most of this literature journalists serve either as channels through which interested institutions speak or as agents whose actions are overdetermined by institutional constraints . Whether one regards them as vehicles which provide " officials a place to elaborate interpretive webs as part of a negotiating and signaling process " ( Schudson 1987 : 97 ) or as relatively unconscious agents of the " everyday practices of domination " ( Gregory 1994 : 44 ) , analysts taking such views effectively erase the agency of journalists as social actors and interpreters ( but see Coutin and Chock 1995 ) . <p> Journalistic accounts of journalism , on the other hand , portray journalists as almost entirely free agents . In its most extreme articulations this journalistic self-representation takes the form of reports of often epic proportions , in which journalists draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intelligent , and brave male , who by virtue of those qualities is able to overcome insurmountable obstacles " ( Pedelty 1995 : 129 ) to construct themselves as flawed but persistent heroes ( or , alternatively , as trickster figures ) on a quest for truth in a landscape of obstructions , illusions and dangers. 2 A phenomenological account of journalists , describing the world from " the native 's point of view " would describe journalists are relatively free agents who struggle against institutional authority , sometimes reluctantly compromising with but never giving in to , hegemony. 3 <p> One of the ways to deal with this structure/ agency problem is to see journalism as a form of language-in-use . To the understanding of journalism as a socially structured practice and a view of journalism as a struggle to represent social dynamics existing " out there , " a structure-in-use approach adds a further insight : journalism embodies social creativity . It is an interpretive practice . Journalists interpret the social world in the act of representing it and they do this by interpreting the social contexts through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this interpretive creativity is not random but both constituted by and constitutive of social epistemologies . Finally , it is out of these interpretive practices that the regularities perceived by media sociology as structures , emerge. 4 <p> Journalism as interpretive practice can be viewed as supplementing or , perhaps , even bridging , other perspectives on the press as a social institution . Certainly there are social dynamics that structure the ways in which the work of journalism is done and which thus contribute to the reproduction of social formations . At the same time , journalism makes truth claims that are read as such and evaluated as such according to widely-accepted cultural epistemologies which belong not only to a journalistic subculture but reflect widely shared American cultural knowledge about the referential nature of true statements . In this article I offer a view of journalism as interpretive practice by focusing on the series of speech acts by which news stories are constructed . In particular , I examine off-the-record discourse , as a particular site where accounts of social dynamics are contested and negotiated between journalists and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written representations are generated . Off-the-Record <p> " Off-the-record " is a domain of discourse between newsmakers and their sources in which public disclosure of what is said is ethically forbidden . The overt purpose of off-the-record communication is to enable journalists to learn information which will help the journalists to contextualize a story . It is also used as a means of supplying journalists with information that , if sourced , might cause problems for the source . The ethical taboo on mimetic reproduction of off-the-record discourse allows responsibility for the content of what is said to be deferred . It therefore serves not only as a safe site for the disclosure of " sensitive " information , as journalists themselves tend to see it but is even more important as a discursive space in which sources can try-out different explanatory scenarios as part of the rhetorical process of " getting to the story . " <p> Off-the-record messages are frequently clearly delineated by a marker : " this is off the record , " " this is just for background , " or " this is n't for publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such discourse ( as when a journalist asks , " look , off the record , what 's really going on here ? " ) In interaction , off-the-record discourse is frequently coded by intimacy markers . These include the use of first names by both parties , a softer more intimate ( or perhaps conspiratorial ) tone of voice and mutual courtesies : " I 've been very impressed with your work , you 've written a couple of good stories , I would n't want you to get this wrong . " and " Look , you 've always been straight with me .. " <p> The utility of off-the-record discourse is linked to the complex construction of authority , responsibility and voice in American newspaper writing . American journalism is mimetic ; it seeks to represent the world by iconically reproducing it , using prepositional descriptions and quotations . These constitute " facts " about the event-object being represented . Journalistic authority is established through sourcing , the verbal representation of indexical relations between facts and the people and events from which these facts are drawn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who uncovered and arranged these facts for us . Journalists thus do not take responsibility for the truth of the facts they represent ; they take responsibility for the accuracy of the mimetic reproduction : getting the names right , having the events accurately described and so forth . The responsibility for truth about the world lies in the object world itself , including the social actors in that world ( like Congressional staffers ) who serve as sources . Because these actors have interests which lead them to privilege certain facts and interpretations , truth is never completed in journalism but must ever be ( re ) represented . Off-the-record discourse allows the sources an opportunity to enter the privileged world of the reporter and editors , that is , to speak outside of representation . To speak off-the-record is to have the opportunity to speak without being discursively responsible for the truthfulness of one 's words . <p> Professional sources like those hired by congressmen to represent them to the press are quick to make use of off-the-record discourse as a strategic resource . Going off the record encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since responsibility for the truth of the content is deferred , off-the-record discourse offers a means to transform normal journalistic interview procedures and shift them to processes of co-narration . Ochs and others have argued that co-narration of events leads to significant cognitive reframings in adult-child relationships ( Ochs et al . 1992 ) . My sense is that among professional sources it is employed toward a similar effect , but often as a specific rhetorical strategy , one in which journalists , because of their need to " get to the story " are complicit . At the very least , going off the record undermines the journalist 's ability to use the power of the question-and-answer format to structure the interactions . <p> Journalists commonly speak of two levels of off-the-record discourse : " off the record " and " deep background . " The distinction involves issues of sourcing . Normal off-the-record discourse allows attribution but at a remove from the individual making the statements . This is textually marked by phrases like , " sources close to the President said .. " Background means the journalist may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not attribute it , even generally . In my experience these distinctions are negotiated rather than constituting clearly marked frames . <p> The general rules for off-the-record discourse are well understood by newsmakers , both journalists and their professional sources . Messages disclosed may not be broadcast , published or otherwise recorded . They may , however , be gossiped about . A good deal of the conversation of reporters meeting at the press club over drinks is a sharing of off-the record information . This exchange is understood to be part of how reporters stay current on what is going on " behind the scenes . " Thus I refer to off-the-record discourse as unwriteable rather than unspeakable ; it can be gossiped , shared and debated but never mimetically recorded and attributed . Indeed , when off-the-record discourse is mimetically reproduced orally as gossip , it retains this essential feature. 5 Going off-the-record thus protects sources from the consequences of mimetic reproduction of their words as they seek to define and interpret facts and events in order to produce coherent representations for public consumption . Negotiating the News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours before the weekly deadline and was asked by my editor if I could write another story. 7 He handed me a packet of materials including copies of two bills introduced by Republican Congressman Alpha , two press releases from Democratic Congressman Beta ( of the same state ) criticizing one of the bills ( HR0001 ) and endorsing the other ( HR0002 ) , and a press release from Alpha 's office listing supporters and cosponsors for the first bill . My editor said he 'd intended to write the story himself but to his unspecialized eye , both bills looked exactly the same . He 'd called Alpha 's office but no one there had been able to explain the difference between the two bills . Since I had previously covered stories on the political issue concerned , and knew both Congressmen , he asked me to " see what the story is . " <p> After reviewing the materials , I went back to my editor and told him that on the surface it appeared that Congressman Alpha had introduced a bill , Congressman Beta had attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman Alpha had introduced a revised version of the bill . We agreed that such a story would make good copy and since the attack was detailed in the press releases , I estimated I could complete the story by the 3-hour deadline if I could get Congressman Alpha 's " side of the story " - that is , his response to Beta 's attacks . The editor-in-chief called me into his office to provide " some additional background : " Alpha was running for governor of an East Coast state and Beta considering running against him . He urged me to keep this in mind as a possible angle . <p> I called Alpha 's office but his press secretary was not in . Explaining that I was under deadline , I asked if there was anyone else who could help me . The chief legislative aide was also out and no one else in the office could explain the differences between the two bills . More importantly , no one in the office was authorized to speak for the congressman . I warned the secretary again that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back as I had strong statements from Congressman Beta and I wanted to give Alpha the opportunity to respond . <p> I spoke with my editors , telling them it looked to me as if Beta 's criticisms might be justified . After all , how could a Congressman create a bill and almost no one in his staff know what it is about ? How could a congressman introduce two different bills on the same issue ? I began sketching out the body of the story , using Beta 's press release and incorporating background on Alpha from the morgue ( the newspaper 's archive of previous stories , clippings , and press releases ) . <p> An hour before deadline , I was called by Alpha 's press secretary , Bert . I explained to him that as I saw it the story was that Alpha had introduced a bill ( HR0001 ) , had been publicly criticized in the home state papers by Beta and in response introduced a second , modified bill that responded to these criticisms . Bert said he was glad he 'd reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained that Alpha had written and introduced the first bill and that he was actively seeking cosponsorship and support for it . He introduced the second bill to get the chief lobbying organization 's position into Congress , not as a result of the criticisms by Beta , which he claimed not to have heard . I read him the strongest language by Beta ( accusations of political one-upmanship ) and got back even stronger language ( Congressman Alpha has forgotten more about this issue than Beta ever knew ) . <p> I led my story with the " fact " of Congressman Alpha having introduced two bills with different legislative intents , described the bills and their current status in the calendar , then introduced Beta 's criticisms and Alpha 's office 's rebuttal . The story was read and passed without further changes by my editor and the editor-in-chief and ran on the front page the next day . <p> After the story ran I received a call from Beta 's press secretary , Ernie , who was " furious " because I had not called him after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my conviction ( supported by my editors ) that an accusation followed by a defense was a sufficiently balanced story . Brinkmanship , after all , can go on indefinitely . Ernie insisted that I needed more " background , " and that Alpha 's office was not telling the truth . I suggested that if he would give me details we might consider a follow-up story . Ernie went off the record and made a number of accusations , specifically that : 1 ) Alpha had introduced two contrary bills so he could claim support from both sides of the issue ; and 2 ) Alpha lied about his second bill ( HR0002 ) being supported by the chief lobbying group for this issue . He suggested I call the lobbying group for " verification , " that is , for on-the-record support of his off-the-record allegations . <p> The spokesperson for the lobbying group provided a different story . She said that her group did support HR0002 , but that they had they had not written the bill and that it did not contain their preferred language . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , she said , had actually written the bill , even though Alpha had introduced it . She added that they had not been asked to support the bill until after it had been introduced . Dropping off the record , the spokeswoman told me that in fact Alpha had stolen the bill from Gamma and that Gamma 's office would confirm this . She said that this " theft " had prevented the lobbying group from building broad support for the bill before it was introduced . <p> Gamma 's office did not confirm this . The spokesperson said that while Congressman Gamma did write HR0002 , he had cosponsored it with Alpha " in a move of bipartisan support " on this issue . Asked to comment specifically on why Alpha had introduced a bill Gamma had written , the spokesperson merely said that " everything moved very quickly . " Off the record , he said that Gamma had been working with the lobbying group to create a bill acceptable both to the Congressional leadership and to the lobbyists . Gamma 's office appraised Alpha because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be reported to . After Alpha read the bill , it was introduced a day later . This had taken Gamma 's office by surprise as they had planned to slowly build support before introducing it . On the face of it , this story seemed to support Beta 's allegations of political brinkmanship by Alpha , but since no one in Gamma 's office would say so on the record , it was not a writeable story . I called the lobbying group again , and this time spoke " on background " to an official with whom I had a long-term relationship . She repeated what her colleague had said and told me I could quote her as a source within the lobbying group but could not print her name or title . <p> I called back Ernie and told him that the story he 'd fed me did n't pan out . He asked me if I would talk to Congressman Beta when he returned to Washington that evening . I asked what more the congressman could add , but Ernie was evasive . We scheduled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening . <p> My editor was out , so I spoke to the editor-in-chief and told him what was going on . He reminded me about the state political angle and suggested I see if I could get Beta to admit on the record that he was going to run for governor . <p> Beta called me at home that evening and I brought up the political angle suggested by my editor . Beta told me for the record that he would run for governor and called this introduction of two opposing bills " a symbolic move " by Alpha that showed " lack of real concern " for the issue . The next morning I called Alpha 's office and offered Bert Beta 's charges that Alpha was playing politics . From Bert I again obtained dramatic quotes for the record , and allegations of political chicanery off the record . The story generated from these interactions was passed by the editor without further changes and appeared on page three as a " news analysis . " Journalism in the Subjunctive Mode <p> To analyze this series of interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants as a separate speech act with its own set of messages , goals and outcomes and media of transmission . Cumulatively , these acts form a speech event that culminates in the production of a written text , a news story . In this case , reactions to the first news story generated a second speech event culminating in the production of a second news story ( see Figure I ) . Space precludes a detailed analysis of each of the twenty acts that comprise these two speech events . What I will focus on here are the epistemologies and heuristics that give order to the process . <p> In the first speech event , I was , as the journalist , charged with the project of " seeing what the story is . " This project emphasizes several of the points of the underlying epistemology of journalism : that there is an object world that can be represented verbally , that the object world is constituted by social events and that previously-inscribed discourses ( press releases , bills introduced ) constitute events in this object world . Most importantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central assumption of journalistic practice : that there is a best possible account and that the production of this best account is the project of journalism . <p> " Getting the story " thus involves recovering , or uncovering , referential meaning . This search for truths , however , is only the first step ; truthful reports must be further organized around the truth , a main point that can serve as an " angle , " or master frame , for construction of a story . This distinction between reports and story draws on the insights of Livya Polanyi , who defines a story as a narrative in which a teller describes events which took place in one specific past time world in order to make some sort of point about the world which teller and recipients share ( Polanyi 1989 : 16 ) . Reports on the other hand , are not supposed to be trying to make a point but rather to recount past , present or future events in a more-or-less non-evaluative way . Reports are usually elicited by the recipients or in response to circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the context of reporting that supplies the framework in which the relevance of the states and events being reported can be ascertained . In fact , the recipients may even apply relevance to very specific pieces of information whose importance escapes the narrator . The burden of assigning differential weighting to the various narrated propositions thus falls on the receiver of the report . The reporter himself may implicitly tell the elicitor , " O.K. , you wanted to know . You figure out what it means " ( p. 20 ) . <p> News stories clearly lie in between these two genres , as is suggested by the terminology used by journalists : reporting is what journalists do , but stories are what they write . A news story is like a report in that it is not written - or , at least , it is not supposed to be written - specifically to make a point . Instead , it is supposed to be a non-evaluative recapitulation of events whose meaning is inherent in the events themselves . The choice of what is reported is not supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dictated by circumstances . Some things are news , and some are not . But a news story is a story in that these events must be organized and arranged according to their relevance , that is , their point . For example , although bounded by specific time lines , news stories are rarely told in chronological order . News stories seek to open ( or lead ) with the most " relevant " information , which may or may not coincide with the most recent information . <p> In reporting , the facts are seen as lying within the sources and the goal of the reporter is to extract these from him or her as directly as possible . The truth value of the source 's statement is measured according to its correspondence to the real object out there in the real world of objects . However , the interaction is complicated by two problems . First , the journalist usually does not have direct access to the event-as-object being represented but can only get to it through the discourse of his or her sources . He or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the phenomenological world but only against other sources . Second , all these sources are known to have " interests " which will bias their subjective ( that is , emotional and mental ) attitude toward the objects and so shape the representations the source offers the reporter . This problem , that the truth is out there and is writeable but the people who know the truth have reasons for not telling it to you accurately , is the paradox that drives the journalistic enterprise . <p> A central problem of interpretive practice for journalists , then , is handling the polyvocality of multiple reports to produce a coherent story . To handle this , journalists treat the event-object of their representation as something to be uncovered so that it can be represented . Sources are treated as people who know about the event-object but for various reasons of their own ( including simple misunderstanding ) seek to obscure or mask that knowledge . " Getting to the story " is largely a process of sifting through reports to see what 's " really going on " so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the story involved both interpreting the written documents according to my own competence and in seeking sources who could explain them . This is typical of political journalism in Washington where it concerns actions of the legislature . As one colleague told me , " the bill is n't the story . The story is what I find out about the bill on the phone after I get back from the press conference where the bill was introduced . " Beginning with a set of faxed press releases and copies of the actual bills ( brought in by newspaper staff from the Government Printing Office downtown ) I began not by simply reporting the two newly introduced bills but by looking for the story behind the bills . <p> This story came to me couched by my editor as a puzzle . Normally , we would expect to see two conflicting bills on the same subject by two rival Congressmen , a situation for which there are standard story frames . Here we had two different bills on the same subject written by the same Congressman . The press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clue for interpreting these bills : Perhaps Alpha introduced the second bill in response to the criticisms made by Beta as described in Beta 's press release . This interpretation is a transformation of the existing interpretive frame and " makes sense " given the assumptions of that frame . It was endorsed tentatively by my editors but we agreed that in order to present it as a story , that is , as a statement of referential truth , it needed to be confirmed by Alpha 's office . At least , Alpha 's " side of the story " would need to be included in our representation . <p> Bert was able to use my effort to " balance " the news to go off the record and offer me an entirely different frame , one that would entirely exclude Beta and his allegations . My final story positions these two frames in tension , describing Alpha 's actions , offering Ernie's/Beta 's interpretation of them and concluding with Bert's/Alpha 's rejoinder . Had I not been working under such a tight deadline , a call to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bills on the same topic is , a call to some other lobbyists and perhaps an academic expert on the topic of the bills might have fleshed out the story . As it was , the lead was rather prosaic - it was the dramatic exchange of insults in the fifth and sixth paragraphs on a slow news day that made the editors consider the story for the front page . <p> There are several anomalous elements to the first speech event , not the least of which is the fact that the story was given to me by my editor as a story . In the normal course of events a reporter is expected to handle his own beat , uncover and recognize stories as they arise , and keep the editor informed of what he is working on . The abnormal number of editorial conferences in the first speech event reflects the odd genesis of the bill , although it seemed natural at the time . The second story is a more reflective of routine processes of news making . In the initial telephone call , Ernie attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or incomplete . Such conversation is de facto off the record since he can be certain a reporter will not make use of such casual criticisms . He goes formally off the record in order to offer a new interpretation of what is going on and offers me a suggestion as to where I can get this confirmed . This leads to a sequence of interactions in which I seek to discover the " true " state of affairs . Each source has an official statement to offer me " for the record " and an interpretation of or claim about the events to offer off the record . The official statements are insufficiently newsworthy to justify a new story but any of the off-the-record allegations would , if true , make a good story . In the end , I called Bert to tell him there 's no story not simply as a courtesy but in an attempt to coerce him into saying something interesting for the record. 8 This led to my conversation with Congressman Beta and his allegations that Alpha 's actions were simply political machinations . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story as " hard news . " In the end , the story that ran as a " news analysis " mimetically reproduced this bickering to highlight the theme ( denied by both Congressmen as applying to themselves ) that political rivalries over gubernatorial and other stakes can impact federal legislation on issues largely unrelated to those stakes . <p> One of the most interesting aspects of both series of speech acts is that each act is contingent . Each speech act has a dynamic of its own driven by the need of the participants to negotiate a frame , the relations between speech acts , and the dynamic of their constitution as a speech event which produces a written text . The journalist seeks continually to discover a story that can be the story , that is , which can be understood as true by reference to the objective world . The journalist abrogates to himself the right to determine which story , or synthesis of stories is the story , but only through reference to prior representations offered by sources , whether documentary or oral . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity as the story is held in check while the reporter pursues additional sources , which lead to additional interpretations . These interactions also expose the degree to which the interpretive practices of journalists are social and how much of what they write as having been uncovered is in fact negotiated . These negotiations are excluded from the written news story 9 yet they are an essential part of interpretive practice . In order to arrange for such negotiations , journalists and their sources , particularly professional sources , recognize off-the-record discourse as a special register of talk specifically used for such negotiation . Off-the-record discourse offers a site within which journalists and sources can handle polyvocality by trying out different explanatory scenarios . <p> In setting out to get to the story , the journalist is engaging in a series of encounters that take place within a structured " field " of journalism , " a microcosm which has its own rules , which is constituted autonomously and which can not be understood from external factors " ( Bourdieu 1997 : 44 ) . To understand what a journalist writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the journalistic field - the status of the newspaper for which the journalist writes ( and hence the authority with which he or she speaks and asks questions ) , the journalist 's specific competence in the writing technologies privileged within the field , the position of the journalist within the sets of roles within the newspaper , and the history of the journalist 's prior relations with the social actors he or she is constituting as sources . <p> The journalistic field is in turn bordered by other fields ; the problematic overlap between these fields is also a necessary context for understanding interpretive practice . Each of the twenty interaction/ negotiations described above , then , can be more thickly described in terms of situated interests within overlapping social fields. 10 From the journalist 's perspective , much of the story lies in interactions taking place in these fields - in this case , particularly , the political . Perhaps more importantly , the engine that powers these interactions derives from the fact that the representations ultimately fixed in textual form constitute a form of capital in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a portfolio that may be used in seeking promotions or new jobs or simply increased status within the field . For professional sources like Ernie and Bert , these texts , if they can be framed as supportive of the politicians and their agendas , are likewise sources of economic and social advancement . <p> In talking about the negotiations of the story in off-the-record discourse it seems to me that neither structural/institutional nor free-agent theories are useful , as both obscure elements of this process . Negotiations take place as a result of interests on the part of various social actors within structurally constrained fields . The interpretive practice of journalists is further affected by the fact that they are not seeking to write against normative frames of understanding . They instead offer accounts of the world that can be read by their audiences as natural , that is , according to the " common sense " frames of interpretation in circulation in the society for which the accounts are intended . " These practices are largely unreflexive . <p> One way to articulate this is with Bourdieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as an " art of inventing . " Life is a series of confrontations between the social actor and situations ; habitus makes it possible to produce an infinite number of practices , each situational and thus " relatively unpredictable " but also " limited in their diversity " ( Bourdieu 1990 : 55 ) . Habitus is the product of our prior encounters with the world , our successes ( positively sanctioned behaviors ) and our failures ( negatively sanctioned behaviors ) and hence it " tends to generate all the ' reasonable , ' ' common-sense , ' behaviors ( and only these ) which are possible within the limits " ( p. 55 ) of the regularities of our life experiences . <p> Practices - like the practice of journalism - are the outcome of an encounter between one 's professional habitus and a particular social field : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Similarly , the journalist , sitting down with her computer and telephone , is not engaging in a process of cultural reproduction or of resistance ; she is trying to write a story about people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will read and understand . The symbolic equipment available to the journalist for making sense of the world in order to define and get at the story is much the same as other members of her cultural background , including her sources , and in the U.S. constantly refers her back to the logic of the market , of free choices and rational calculation . The professional habitus that informs her writing practices , the language in which she commits her story to words , is further organized by a particular cultural logic : a logic of objectivity . The Logic of Objectivity <p> Objectivity seems to have two basic meanings as it is used by journalists . The first is an epistemological concept : that there is a world of objects out there , a world of things that are real and can be known , as opposed to things which are merely believed or felt . News stories are factual insofar as they accurately map the object-world to which they refer . The second meaning is an operational concept . It involves a personal stance toward the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put aside one 's own feelings , beliefs and interests so that one can " see things " objectively in order to produce factual accounts . Although obviously interconnected , these two meanings can be distinguished , and are sometimes labeled by scholars as " factuality " and " impartiality " respectively ( Westerstahl 1983 ) . <p> Together , factuality and impartiality construct a logic by which journalistic practices are oriented . Journalistic objectivity seeks to establish representations of the world of objects independent of individual consciousnesses or wills . It takes this as its end in spite of recognition by most journalists that sources do not report objectively , but in accordance with their own interests , and that audiences do not read objectively but in accordance with their own pre-existing subjectivities . Indeed , this is part of its strength : journalism puts itself forward as the neutral discourse , a perspectiveless view of all perspectives , which is superior to the knowledge claims of its sources who are condemned to error by the partisan particularity of their own interest-driven particular viewpoints . <p> The relation between factuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When asked ( by an ethnographer , for example ) to reflect on their own practices , most journalists deride the concept of objectivity . A close analysis of their discourse demonstrates , however , that what most journalists actually debunk is objectivity in the second sense . By focusing on the notion that " nobody is ever really objective " they can deal with some of the problems they face without having to challenge the underlying epistemology . Indeed , journalists often react aggressively against challenges to the epistemological assumption adopted by some sociologists of journalism that " facts " about the world are symbolic " constructs , " insisting that such theoretical approaches defy " common sense . " The common sense in which this is embedded is an American " folk epistemology , conceiving of ' the truth ' as being singular , unequivocal , and semantically transparent once it has been identified " ( Briggs 1986 : 22 ) . <p> In the American context , the tension between these operational and epistemological concepts of objectivity have produced a particular mode of writing . At the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> News is mimetic . It assumes not only that there is an object world but that this world can be effectively represented by language so long as one sticks to mimetic representations of speech and action , categorized as " facts " and " events . " <p> News is deictic . News authorizes itself through its referential function , the way that it relates its accounts to the real world being reported on . The byline is a crucial indexical marker , linking the news story to the object world of events by offering ( and naming ) the specific mechanism by which the two worlds are connected . The byline thus transforms signification by resemblance into signification by spatial and temporal contiguity . <p> News is news because it " protrudes from the ordinary . " News is constituted as a figure-ground problem . The ground of news constitutes the everyday world of common sense ; the figure represents some breach in common-sense reality that allows one to constitute a story . In order to frame stories as news , then , journalists must rely on pre-existing cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural frames will inevitably tend toward cultural reproduction , even though each given interaction is open-ended and offers scope for invention , ambiguity and interpretive play . <p> The mimetic style adopted by American journalists is one strategy for handling the tension between the factual and the impartial understandings of objectivity . Mimetic reproduction of direct quotation and the practice of sourcing information allows journalists to displace some of the responsibility for truth claims onto other persons . In essence , the journalist is guaranteeing the " objective " accuracy of the mimetic reproduction in the story but not the truth of the assertions being made by the persons quoted or otherwise sourced . <p> These practices conceal the degree to which the structure of the story , the decisions as to who will be quoted and the angle or " slant " of the story is a socially negotiated process . Reporting presents itself as a process of " uncovering " ( rather than constituting ) facts and representing them in words . However , this action mystifies the degree to which such actions are negotiated . The inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to which representations of the object world are negotiated , are excluded from representation . Exceptions are made only when inclusion of some element of the context is necessary to make sense of a quotation or other representation ( see Clayman 1990 ) <p> Journalists are not entirely unaware of their epistemological dilemmas . Commentary on these issues constitutes a heterodox zone within journalism , sometimes characterized as " the new journalism . " Most journalists run up against situations that expose these dilemmas at some time in their careers . In stories they tell , reporters attempt to speak as direct observers about matters of empirical fact and are squelched by editors , who as gatekeepers of journalistic objectivity , are quick to suppress such behavior . Unexamined by journalism is the possibility that the object world perhaps can not be neutrally represented or that journalism is a particular form of knowledge whose truthfulness lies not so much in its reference to the object-world as in the mode of production which engenders it . <p> The importance of objectivity as a conceptual framework is marked by every ethnographer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objectivity to journalistic practice . Tuchman ( 1972 ) has looked at objectivity as a " ritual practice , " a repetitive series of actions through which journalism is produced . Iyengar ( 1995 ) has presented objectivity as a system of frames . Both these concepts largely ignore the creative , performative and negotiated aspects of journalism , particularly since Iyengar 's notion of frames is a cognitive one quite different from the attention given to the ongoing negotiation of framing activity proposed by the originators of the term ( Bateson 1972 ; Goffman 1974 ) . More recently , Pedelty ( 1995 ) has offered the notion of objectivity as a " disciplinary apparatus , " one of several which organize the social fields in which journalism takes place . This is a useful notion , particularly since it draws attention not only to constraints but to the pleasures - " pay , promotion , notoriety , identity , fantasy " - that draw journalists toward the reproduction of cultural forms favored by institutions . However , it tends to draw attention to the structure of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action . My own effort here is to draw attention to the links between epistemologies and the heuristics that social actors use it interpreting situations so that they can act in them . For this reason , I am here considering objectivity as a practical logic . <p> A " practical logic , " Bourdieu says , " understands only in order to act " ( 1990 : 91 ) . Faced with the subjunctive , contingent nature of reporting , a reporter finds that objectivity provides a generative logic that can produce a universe of action without reporters being under the burden of carrying about an imaginary " file of prefabricated representations " ( Jakobson 1956 : 58 ) . Off-the-record discourse offers a privileged and perhaps necessary site for much of this action to take place . Faced with the unsubstantiated but attractive claims offered by sources ( and editors ) off the record , the logic of objectivity allows the reporter to act creatively in order to bring negotiations around to a writeable story . <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
