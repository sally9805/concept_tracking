" History is not history unless it is the truth . " - Abraham Lincoln <p> Most Americans understand history as an objective accounting of past events . In recent years , however , textbook publishers have come under increasing criticism for rewriting history . Claims are presented as facts while controversial material is whitewashed or omitted . <p> Today these trends are quite apparent in the way public school history books address Islam . In his 2008 study " Islam in the Classroom : what the textbooks tell us , " Gilbert Sewall , director of the American Textbook Council ( ATC ) , reviewed 10 of the nation 's most widely used junior and senior high school history textbooks . The results should disturb anyone interested in conveying to our children a truthful history of the religion whose extreme adherents drive so many of today 's tragic headlines . <p> At a time when America is locked in a battle of ideas with Islamic extremists and other enemies of freedom , accurate knowledge is indispensable . Yet , Sewall 's findings underscore how political correctness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's be clear . Religion is by nature a sensitive topic to teach in the classroom . And in a world where stereotypes wrongly tar all Muslims as being prone to violence , it 's understandable that schools would err on the side of caution . Indeed , they should affirm the piety and charity practiced by hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world , an acknowledgement that should be extended to Christians as well . At the same time , textbooks should n't cower from covering the violent periods of Muslim conquest or the facts . For example , in the 1990s , " jihad " - which has many meanings , among them " sacred " or " holy " struggle but also " holy war " - was defined in the Houghton Mifflin junior high school book only as a struggle " to do one 's best to resist temptation and overcome evil . " <p> The many acts of violence committed on behalf of Islam in the past decade have made that definition incomplete , to say the least . Yet , as ATC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed jihad from its entire series of social studies textbooks . " <p> In discussing sharia law , the Islamic code that can be used to subjugate women and deal death to wayward believers , many textbooks are intentionally vague . Holt Rinehart Winston 's 2006 " Medieval to Early Modern Times " junior high textbook states simply , " Sharia sets rewards for good behavior and punishments for crimes . " Another popular history textbook states , " Muslim law requires that Muslim leaders offer religious toleration . " <p> Descriptions of Islam since 9/11 are particularly disturbing . Though Islamic extremism has become a fact of life throughout much of the world , most of the reviewed textbooks suggest instead that poverty , ignorance , and the existence of Israel are at the root of terrorism . The closest that any textbook gets to suggesting a faith-based component to terrorism is Glencoe 's " Modern Times , " which states broadly that " Muslims have not accommodated their religious beliefs to the modern world . " <p> The whitewashing of Islam becomes even more noticeable when contrasted with how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " religious wars launched against Muslims by European Christians . " But when Muslims attacked Christians and took their land , the process is referred to as " building " an empire . <p> A McDougal Littell volume claims that non-Muslims in Muslim-ruled territories converted to Islam because " they were attracted by Islam 's message of equality and hope for salvation . " A good history class should teach students to ask critical questions . Are students asking how much of that " conversion " was coerced by the sword ? Sadly , most texts gloss over Muslim leaders history of enslavement of " infidels " and their brutal treatment of women , which continues today in some countries . <p> In an interview , Sewall summed up the reactions of textbook publishers to his report . " In a word , " he said , " hostile . " <p> Sewall says the pressure tactics used by some Muslim groups on publishers to portray Islam in a favorable light amount to a kind of " cultural jihad . " This essentially is what the founder of the Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbooks in America , was saying when he described his work as a " bloodless revolution ... inside American junior high and high school classrooms . " <p> Sewall understands that historical inaccuracies sometimes take decades to be written out of textbooks . " Once lies are written into textbooks , " he says , " they tend to be perpetuated in new editions . " Which is one reason why Sewall will continue to make his case to publishers . <p> I hope Sewall has better success than I had . When I served as undersecretary of the Education Department under President Reagan , I discovered that a " values neutralism " was saturating school textbooks , seriously misleading our children about the nature of Soviet governance by , for instance , stating that women enjoyed the same rights as men and severely downplaying the suppression of basic human rights inherent in communist political systems . <p> In the same way , students today are being taught a distorted view of Islam . Having been on the front lines in the struggle to achieve the best education for our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parents voices are heard . Teachers need courage in overcoming political correctness by curriculum committees and communicating with teachers . Parents also should communicate with their members of Congress to ensure that textbook publishers are not being pressured to present a false account of history . Feel-good distortions of history do n't help our kids ; they just help those who wish to do us harm . <p> Gary Bauer is a former undersecretary of the Department of Education under President Reagan .
