John Benenate 's b.i.k.e . program uses road cycling-and pancakes-to turn inner-city kids into state champions . // Visit the ramshackle headquarters of b.i.ke . ( Bicycles and Ideas for Kids ' Empowerment ; kidsofbike.org ) in Portland , Oregon , on a Saturday morning , and you 'll see an unlikely assemblage of African-American , Latino and Caucasian kids in bike shorts and jerseys , or track pants and cotton Ts-all ready to attack the weekly 15- to 50-mile ride . The 31 - member team , with a budget cobbled together from grants and donations , is currently ranked 12th in Oregon among junior and senior teams . But they do n't focus only on winning : " We try to respond to each of the kids ' needs , " says founder and coach John Benenate , 39 , a paraplegic since a non-cycling accident in 1992 , " whether it 's SAT flashcards or cyclocross training . " BICYCLING caught up with team b.i.Le . at its pre-ride breakfast . Two riders who spoke up were 14-year-old Bernard Barfield , a 285-pound track racer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group at the 2004 state championship crit after only a few months on the team . What brought you to b.i.k.e. ? Barfield : I came because I want to lose weight , and I enjoy cycling . Hamilton : I joined through S.E.I , an after-school program for inner-city youth . Benenate : He was stone-cold talent . Hamilton : I won handlebar tape when I won my age division for the crit at the state championships . Benenate : One of our riders joined because he smelled pancakes outside our club headquarters . He was kind of a neighborhood bully , but he wanted pancakes . He 'd go on the rides and ask when they 'd be over . Two years ago he became a state champ . Are the workouts hard ? Hamilton : They are challenging-that 's what I like about them . When I won the state championship , my mom was impressed . Benenate : I remember a really good practice recently that made me proud to be a bicycle coach . You guys rode cross-town , helped me clean up some stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laps at the pool . It was like a little triathlon . What do you like about cycling ? Barfield : We go on really long rides and I get to go places my mom would never let me go . When I see something like a shop I did n't know about , I figure out what bus route goes past it . Benenate : I 'm trying to teach the kids to be cool-to go to cafs and museums and hang out . To get themselves there by bike . What 's the secret to the team 's racing success ? Benenate : It 's weird : I was in some 300 bike races and triathlons ; I ran , I swam . But I never won a bicycle race , and it 's just a mind-blower to me that everybody on this team just wins and wins . We 've won about 50 state championships in the last 10 years . I emphasize benevolence , good form , simplicity and team . I do n't quite have an answer for why we 've been so successful : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do love the sport . We have an old-school hunger . Our riders will go toe-to-toe with anyone . How has b.i.k.e . changed your life off the bike ? Barfield : It helped me to be on top of my game . I used to be late for everything but now I 'm on time . Hamilton : At the state championship , I wanted to give up but everyone told me to just keep going-so I did . I would n't have been able to do that without the team . What do you look forward to ? Barfield : I look forward to being a world champion of the velodrome . I have python legs but they 've got to be stronger . I 'm going to come to practice every Saturday . Hamilton : I just want to be the best I can be . If I lose a race , I know I have to work harder. - Sarah Bowen Shea Sidebar Members of Portland , OR 's Team b.i.k.e . are " beautiful fun , and love the sport , " says their coach ( center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cool-to go to cafs and museums and nang out .
