A LETTER <p> June 30 , 2007 <p> Dear Mr. Emilson , <p> This is to inform you that the final closing on your building on East 6th Street was successfully completed at 10:15 this morning . I have deposited the check as you instructed . The new owners will begin renovations tomorrow . In our previous communications , I asserted that the structure , now in great disrepair , was completely abandoned . However , yesterday afternoon as I made my last walk-through , I found on the second floor a short note , a manuscript wrapped in a rubber band , and an old computer . As these technically belong to you , please let me know if you want them forwarded to your London address . I have not unbound the manuscript , but reproduce for you here the short note left on top : <p> So much blurs ... I write then forget what I write ... walk these streets , a stranger to myself and others ... Then sometimes it all suddenly flares back-my breath catches , my brain aches . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who made me from dead , discarded things , then left me ? Why did he need to see me as frightful , misbegotten ? I know he 'll never hear , never answer . <p> Walking , I remember the other ones as well , those three I watched though none of them could see me . Is n't seeing a wounding and caressing both ? All of them gone now , though once I held them with my secret eyes and in my own way loved them . Mary , Claire , Clerval ... All those hours they visited me in air , came to me as voices made of flesh , ripe with shades of meaning , though in the end all that 's left of them is absence . <p> Why did she need to portray me as she did ? For so long I tried not to think of our days in the graveyard , the clicking of pebbles in her hands as she sat near the bushes , listening while I read . Even now the details grow faint ... I try to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me wants only to remember . She was a child of nine sitting by her mother 's grave . I sat behind the bushes with my books . Once we briefly spoke . Mostly I read to her , that 's all . And her step-sister Claire , how strange that she came to me years later , long after I 'd been wandering , heading North , far off in the Arctic by then . Why did she need to come to me , or was it I who needed her ? And Clerval , that gentle man who everyone thought dead-in fact he traveled east as he 'd wanted . Even now I sometimes picture his hand moving in gentle transcription as day after day he translated the Dream of The Red Chamber in his house at the foot of Xiangshan Hill , and wrote letters to his friend in Aosta . <p> Is n't any voice largely mute and partial , even those that speak openly and plainly ( though of course I mostly hide ) . Why do I leave this ? These words absorbed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON THE EARTH SEEN FROM SPACE <p> Over and over the word fragile . " It looked so fragile , so delicate , that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart . " This from James Irwin , crew member of Apollo 15 . <p> Astronaut Loren Acton spoke of seeing it " contained in the thin , moving , incredibly fragile shell of the biosphere . " <p> To Aleksei Leonov , the first man to walk in space , the earth looked " touchingly alone . " And when Vitali Sevastyanov was asked by ground control what he saw , he replied , " Half a world to the left , half a world to the right , I can see it all . The Earth is so small . " <p> Neil Armstrong said , " I put up my thumb and shut one eye , and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth . I did n't feel like a giant . I felt very , very small . " <p> And Ulf Merbold : " For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accentuated by a thin seam of dark blue light . I was terrified by its fragile appearance . " ( Is this what frightened you , is this what you sought to combat and to flee ? This fragility , this somehow-knowledge even then before anyone had ever left the earth or seen it from a distance , of how small it is and delicate , as we are too , how finite , how beside-the-point , how fleeting . ) <p> ( Might this partly account for my monstrous proportions , as if you were building a shield , a fortress of flesh , as if the vertiginous wings of blood in us could somehow be made to tremble less . But I 'm a blunt and narrow piece of materiality . Imprinting and imprinted . As were you . Footprints , strands of broken hair dropped here and there . ) <p> On March 18 , 1965 , Alexei Leonov exited the main capsule of Voskohod by pushing himself head-first out of the opening . A 16-foot lifeline held him to the ship . If it broke he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed , there was no air rushing past to let him feel it . He spun slowly for ten minutes . But when the co-pilot Belyayev told him to come back he did n't want to return . <p> ( He did n't want to return . And yet it seems a lonely thing-that feeling of nothing pushing back . ) <p> Several months later , Edward White walked in space for 20 minutes , though the term 's deceptive as the motion is of free-fall or floating . Seen from 120 miles away , earth was nearly featureless . When he returned to the space ship he had lost 5 kg of body mass , and 2 kg of perspiration had collected in his boots . <p> But he , too , did n't want to return to the capsule . <p> When told to come back to the spacecraft he said , " This is the saddest moment of my life . " <p> His co-pilot pulled him back in . <p> ( And you will work in sorrow the fields ... As if your laboratory were a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind needing to be healed . But when he floated there , in that region without weight or mass or shadow , all fields fell away , all shattering turned soft and pliant , there was no need anymore either to build or to destroy- ) <p> ( But how my mind builds and destroys you over and over . ) <p> On January 27 , 1967 , two years after his space walk , Edward White died in a fire on Launch Complex 34 at the Cape Canaveral Air Station . He had entered Apollo 1 for a simulated countdown along with Command Pilot Grissom and Pilot Roger Chaffee when the fire broke out . <p> Years later White 's wife took her own life . <p> ( How strange to see the earth from the sky and then come back ... to float in space like that , barely tethered , earth a modest uncrowned thing . " So peaceful and so fragile , " one said of it . The size of a marble or a pearl " hanging delicately , " said another . And another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still , there are many practicalities to be addressed ( as you would have known even from your rudimentary laboratory ) . " It 's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize one 's safety factor 's been determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract , " the astronaut Alan Shepherd pointed out . <p> And Neil Armstrong spoke of a feeling that was " complex , unforgiving . " <p> Lyndon Johnson said , " It 's too bad , but the way the American people are , now that they have all this capability , instead of taking advantage of it , they 'll probably just piss it away . " <p> ( But what would it mean to take advantage ? ) <p> ( And what of how small , and of how fragile ... ) <p> ( Over and over the word fragile describing this world that has taught me such resistance , the hard of it and brutal , and yet , still- ) <p> Numerous inventions made for space have been adapted by private industry , resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to shield his eyes from the extreme glare of sunlight ) , the 5-year flashlight and cordless power hand tools . <p> The U.S. Space Walk of Fame Foundation was formed in the 1990 's as a " major component of a redevelopment master plan designed for Titusville 's urban waterfront . " There you can " visit the gift shop at the museum and treat yourself , a friend or a relative to a truly unique space-related gift . " <p> ( When Leonov and White floated in space they did n't want to come back . They could n't have known this beforehand . And what is a footstep then , after that , and the feeling of earth ( so fragile , so small ) beneath a shoe , or the thin tether of breath , or a name , or a day , a boundary , a theory , a bond- ) <p> ICE DIARY <p> * * * <p> I 'm now far North . Archangel . Salt winds from the White Sea mix with naptha and lignite from the shipyards . Sea-ice cracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much whiteness violently dividing . Then stillness : ice locks in around the ships , seals them like footprints left in wax , or Pharoahs , mummy-wrapped , trapped and burning inward . For months each hull 's a secret violently kept , volatile and cryptic . Shore lights flicker like something slowly starving . <p> If I still had a voice , if I could speak . But who would I speak to even then ? These notes as if written in invisible ink . And the taste of blood in my mouth , or is it the memory of ... And those bushes where I hid ... <p> This morning I found a single stick ornamented with Chinese glass beads . Also a Kufan coin , a blurred list of provisions , a pair of oilskin breeches , a cap . A harsh quietness in them like the silence othose ice-locked hulls . Something helpless in them too , as if as they lay there in the ice they felt unremembered and remembering , unconnected yet somehow still connected-but to what ? ( Though of course I knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost ships ? <p> But so many years since ... And inflamed from blinding snow ... And so far from ... But I do n't want to think about that now ... <p> Even this town 's frozen-through . Stone walls still stand though most of what they guard 's long vanished . A few abandoned fortresses , a monastery , the mouth of the Northern Dvina nearby . <p> If I could see behind the shuttered windows-hands moving and changing even now-but I do n't want to see such things again , want only to leave . It 's said the more you draw toward true North the farther it recedes . There 's no way to finally arrive . Still , I want to feel it . <p> This sting of salt . This shocked and changing emptiness of air . No trace of sea-birds , wolves . Slave built the canal here . Soon I will go farther . <p> * * * <p> Lately when I close my eyes I see only this : a woman 's white sleeve , her hand moving across a page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut-brown or black or darker brown . Sometimes it crosses out words , sometimes whole sentences , builds fences of x 's , drops ink-stains on the page . Sometimes it turns the paper to the side , writes over and across words already left there . Or it halts as if netted , a sudden clenching of the tendons at the wrist . The first few times I could see little of the page but now that 's changing . <p> Each night I wait for it-that white sleeve gathered at the wrist , that small determined hand . I read what it leaves : <p> Tonight I 'm remembering Snow Hill . They called me Jane then , not Claire . Mother and Godwin never once called me Claire . Cold nights under flimsy blankets-as if that very name , Snow Hill , was seeping into the walls and through my bones . The square where the public executions were held stood barely 100 feet from our front door . The year we arrived ( I was 9 ) they hung Haggerty and Halloway for the lavender merchant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . Mary and I barely slept , thinking of that crush of feet like cattle 's hooves , and all those faces suddenly unable to breathe , mouths useless holes . Afterwards I walked down the street alone , past the milliner shops , furriers , coffee dealers , wondering what strange creatures we are to inflict such things on ourselves . Minds contaminate themselves and actions grow ruinous . I feel this in myself-ruin prodigious and luxuriant as plant-life . It flourishes , this crumbling , this destruction , and yet there 's also- <p> It was around that time I searched through Mother 's things for my birth certificate . But it seems there 's no record of my birth or baptism . Some say she was put in a debtor 's prison shortly after I was born ( so was I in that debtor 's prison too ? ) then relieved and set free through a charitable subscription . A few years later she met Godwin . I 've no name for my father . Maybe it 's better this way . <p> Snow Hill-I still feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted only to leave . Though I loved the books on the shelves and sometimes the eyes that watched me , the eyes I watched back . How watching is a kindness and a shackling both . The chain of it , the net , the binding . And I remember , above the doorway , the stone face of Aesop reading . <p> * * * <p> Sea-water ice holds my weight when I walk , but black ice is thin , ca n't be trusted . Sometimes I do n't know which one I 'm on . The wind 's a fist in my mouth . I bend down , huddle on the ground , try only to breathe . Or I come back inside , say her name to myself : Claire . Air . <p> Why do I wait for her ? - that hand and the walls of ink it builds and leaves . <p> Claire . Air . Care . Clear . Claire . <p> At first glance the hand 's delicate , but I see now the finger-bones are strong . Lately she comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air and writing . Forty degrees below , sixty degrees below . Her white nightdress thin , yet she seems to feel no cold . <p> Her face not visible to me . I never see her face . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
