Everyone knows the taste of sweet and sour , but what do hot and cold taste like ? According to scientists from the Yale School of Medicine , temperature has its own flavors . Writing in the current issue of Nature , they report that warming the front of the tongue induces a suggestion of sweetness , and cooling it produces a salty or sour taste ; chilling the back of the tongue , by contrast , creates a sour or bitter sensation . No one knows if these false taste sensations affect flavor , but experts suspect they are too faint for the brain to discern in the sensory din of a mouthful of well-seasoned food . <P>  --  By Unmesh Kher
