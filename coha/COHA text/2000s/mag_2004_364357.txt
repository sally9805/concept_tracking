The man who built the world 's largest fashion and luxury-goods group did n't do so by being soft and frilly . Bernard Arnault , 54 , controls Christian Dior and LVMH , which markets some 50 well-known brands , including Marc Jacobs fashions , Louis Vuitton bags and a cluster of famous champagnes . He put his empire together over 20 years and often used hard-nosed tactics to get what he wanted . He may not have created LVMH 's brands , but more than anyone , Arnault understood their worldwide potential and how to exploit it . <P> Born into a family of entrepreneurs , Arnault got his big break in 1984 , when he took over a textile conglomerate that included Dior . In 1989 he won a fierce battle for control of family-run Louis Vuitton . With a mixture of clever marketing , innovative design and tight control over how and where the products are sold , Arnault turned Vuitton and Dior into highly profitable global businesses . In the economic downturn , Arnault reined in his acquisitive urges . Now that growth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll start buying again .  --  By Peter Gumbel
