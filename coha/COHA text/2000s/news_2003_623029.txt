<p> DEFENDING THE CLITORIS AND FORESKIN <p> Editor  --  Thank you for illuminating a topic ( " Celebrating the clitoris , " March 9 ) that has been avoided by polite society for way too long . I commend Heather Knight and The Chronicle for seeing this topic as worthy for a front-page feature of the Living section . <p> COLEEN MACKIN <p> Brisbane <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Congratulations to Christopher Heredia for his article ( " A different kind of penis envy : Students fight to save foreskins , " March 9 ) . And kudos to Greg Dervin for founding Students for Genital Integrity . As the vice president of Doctors Opposing Circumcision , I commend Greg for getting college students involved in the battle to end infant circumcision in the United States , the only country in the world that routinely circumcises male newborns . <p> DOC is an organization of physicians and others who are opposed to routine neonatal circumcision . DOC has members in 50 states , 12 Canadian provinces and territories , and in nations on six continents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcibly remove sexual body parts from another individual . We also believe that physicians should have no role in this painful , unnecessary procedure inflicted on the newborn . <p> MARK D. REISS , M.D. <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Christopher Heredia 's article leaves the reader with the impression that health experts are divided on the issue of male circumcision and that only recently has the practice been found to have no medical value . <p> The only official statement from a medical organization the article quotes is the 1999 American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) " Circumcision Policy Statement . " If one actually reads this statement ( available online at **30;10188;TOOLONG ) one will see stated on the first page that " Beginning in 1971 . . . the Academy concluded that there was no absolute medical indication for routine circumcision " and citations of many other statements repeating this policy over the years . The 1999 AAP statement was a reaffirmation that added that the AAP " does not recommend " routine circumcision . The AAP has also recognized that neonatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AAP is joined in this view by the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . The British Medical Association has officially recognized the right of physicians to be conscientious objectors to the practice of male circumcision . The Australian College of Paediatrics has expressed concern that neonatal circumcision may violate human rights . <p> Considering that most of these organizations ' official statements come up as the first link on a search of their official Web sites , it is a serious disservice to Chronicle readers to leave them with any other impression than that the cutting of healthy baby boy genitals has been believed to have no medical value by major medical organizations internationally for decades . <p> ROGER SCHWENKE <p> Albany <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Thank you for taking the time to alert people about the pros and cons of circumcision . I have two sons , and before giving birth to the older one in 1988 , I saw a TV show about how painful circumcision can be for a baby ( no anesthesia , etc . ) . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of my sons were not circumcised . Your article helps me feel vindicated that I did the right thing for them so many years ago . <p> MARITES LEE <p> San Rafael <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  In contrasting these articles ( on female and male genital circumcision ) , I could not overlook the similarity in the rationales given for promoting the genital cutting of girls and boys : promotes hygiene , looks more attractive , the child looks like the adult , etc . <p> The article " Celebrating the clitoris " read : " Many people believe the clitoris is dirty and , if not removed , will balloon into a nasty , dangerous thing . " If the word clitoris is replaced with foreskin , you see how the two circumcision practices are born from the same cultural bias . <p> What is painful for me , having grown up in a medically " advanced " culture , is how a medical system based on undisputed science could override the human rights of the individual with beliefs and bias . The only underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a healthy , normal baby boy . <p> MICHAEL KEITH <p> Oakland <p> LIVING IGNORES NEEDS OF MEN <p> Editor  --  Living has evolved to resemble something closer to Women 's Day or Redbook magazines than a section intended for all your readers . For the past several weeks , the bulk of its content has had a decidedly female slant . Have you lost sight of the fact that there are two sexes " Living " in the Bay Area ? <p> Undoubtedly , reading these articles can help all of us men gain insight into issues concerning the opposite sex . In all fairness , however , you need to expand your focus and start including some topics of interest to men or , at the very least , those that can benefit equally everyone who reads The Chronicle . <p> Then again , it may be that women are whom you have in mind as your primary audience when choosing editorial content . In that case , may I suggest you simply rechristen the section with the more appropriate name " Female Living " and call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> San Francisco <p> ANOTHER ANGLE ON THE PENTAGON <p> Editor  --  C.W. Nevius ' Sunday column ( " A new angle on homework , " March 9 ) brought back memories of our kids with the same cardboard construction projects . However , on a more serious note , the opening sentence said volumes to me . <p> " The pentagon was clearly a mistake . " I know that Nevius was talking about the shape as it ties in with the rest of his article , but the thought comes to my mind that the mistakes emanating from inside the Pentagon are far more devastating and difficult to understand than the construction itself . <p> MEL HIRSEKORN <p> Redwood City <p> GOING STRONG AT 40 AND BEYOND <p> Editor  --  I came home from an 83-mile ( 3,000-foot elevation gain/loss ) bike ride and relaxed with Jane Ganahl 's column ( " World awakens to sexy charms of older women , " March 9 ) . It seems that many women who have worked long and hard to develop their careers are turning 40 and extolling the virtues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by describing my bike ride . I even look pretty respectable in bike shorts . Bike shorts have got to be the worst-designed garment there is , and I still wear the same size 501 jeans as when I was 40 . That was 20 years ago . <p> From where many women sit , 40 is not older , it is just a beginning , and we should love every minute of it . <p> If you want to really do something for older women , start to talk to those of us older than 55 . We are intelligent , funny ( we have to be to survive ) , accomplished at something , have a sense of ourselves and those around us , and have somewhat of an understanding of life , living and loving  --  yet we are invisible ( especially if we are single ) . The invisible part is what I will not allow . <p> Please interview , photograph , explore and write about us . You will not only tell the world that women of 55-plus are incredibly vital and vibrant ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also provide a fabulous service to those women just turning 40 . <p> I love looking at and meeting women in their 80s with charm and passion flowing in their veins . <p> LENORE CYMES <p> Palo Alto <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  Although it may be true that young women have firm bodies and smooth , wrinkle-free skin , they often lack the maturity of older women , in that many of them tend to behave in a juvenile fashion . <p> When I was a young man , so very long ago , I preferred dating women older than myself , as I had become tired of putting up with giggling , air-headed girls . I found that in the company of mature women it was not always necessary to grasp for subject matter to discuss . Rather , I thoroughly enjoyed being in the company of quiet , self-assured women who did not feel the need for continual conversation in order to be relaxed and comfortable . And in the boudoir there is absolutely no substitute for experience . <p> ROBERT WATKINS <p> San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized a long time ago that although youth is wasted on the young , they are in the greatest biological segment of their life as soon as they reach 40 . In this country we have a cult of youth  --  the music industry caters to them , the fashion industry does the same , and look at the garbage that Hollywood is churning out . It is a well-known fact that 12-year-olds are a multimillion-dollar source of revenue to the producers of all that . So Madison Avenue pursues them with gusto , leaving the impressionable " older " woman in the dust and clouds of self-doubt . <p> Yes , I enjoy looking at young women , just as women like looking at a muscular guy . But more that anything else , I hate having to explain current events to someone who ca n't be bothered to read the newspaper or watch the news on TV . Even worse , I sometimes find myself lecturing on recent and past history in order to be able to explain what I 'm talking about . <p> Let the younger gals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . I will always prefer the company of a mature woman who is self-confident and secure in the knowledge that the road ahead can be just as exciting as some that she took in order to arrive at her current stage in life . Women in their 40s , 50s and even 60s can be very sexy  --  just so long as they do n't try to pretend they 're in their 20s . <p> GEORGE BARANTSEFF <p> San Francisco <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I am almost 56 , but feel and apparently look as if I am in my 40s . I have been on my own ( a single women ) for only two years , so I feel I am still evolving or becoming comfortable with my true self . It has been a surprise to reach the realization that I am so much better now than I have ever been ! Better as a confident , self-assured , positive-thinking person . <p> Of course , I still hope to meet a man with whom I could look forward to spending the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for writing : Why do n't we really pursue dating , matchmaking or survival series TV for people past 50 ? We are all here ; ready , willing , able and so very qualified for a long-term relationship , along with all the compromise and concessions necessary for success . We might be the forgotten minority , but we will soon be in the majority . I , for one , vote to address this issue now ! <p> JULIE PHELPS <p> San Francisco
