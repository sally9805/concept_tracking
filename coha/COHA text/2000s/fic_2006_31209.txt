Chapter One JOAN 37 now but thinks of herself as 40 , to soften the coming blow . " Then , " the litany goes , " I 'll be 50 - a woman in her 50s . " " Then I 'll be 63 . " " Then 70 . Then 76 , 77 . " " Then I will be 81 - 83 . " She does n't go so far as to muse upon a future place of residence or quality of caretakers , shuddering when she passes assisted living homes , extended care America , thinking of her mom , but is certain of one thing , that she will be alone : all the while feeling those ages to be just round the corner , come in a blink , knowing intellectually re the fleetingness of time that there were many celebrated men and women , avatars , essayists , and intellects who could back her subjective notions with hard text or admirably glib spiritual pronouncement . Easy to evoke , even during mundane daytime chores , those philosophical flights of grad school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stanford semiotics , string theory and such , rhapsodically sprayed like Halloween gunk on the trees and bushes of verbiage , space and time - collapse of reason and rationale like so many symphonies pounded to the size of the head of a pin , Gdel , Escher , Bach , so be it . Was n't that the dream of this life ? She 'd been having a **30;1615;TOOLONG for over a year now , as if her mind , that great computer , were searching for a lost jpeg : the Perfect Memorial file . In a nocturnal reverie she called the Castle of Perseverance , details of the catastrophe were vague and illegible , as 10-minute-old skywriting on a still summer 's day or the half-erased chalkmarks of simple equations upon green slate . Joan floated there too , billowy charcoal housecoat open like the commodious wings of that tree-flying squirrel she saw on a Discovery Channel doc , or a whimsical matron 's smock in a children 's book , and she could always just about make out the smokily verdant terrain below . The locus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her wittier lover-confidants called it - for which , in nondreaming life , her firm , ARK , had been hired to commemorate , the REM/Rem locus , as it turned out , was neither domestic nor international but hovered somewhere above , in a cottonball Canadian Christo-wrapped airspace 5 full skycrapers above . Sometimes a superstructure the firm had bid for and lost - there were a number of them , more than Barbet wanted to count - but one in particular , in China , seemed persistently to shanghai her nightworld , grafting failed CG skinsketch onto gauzy somnambulist constructions . In the dream , millions were to be memorialized , when the truth is ARK ( 10 years ago aptly , chicly named ) had been hired by a billionaire whose brother and sister-in-law died near Chennai in the Christmas tsunami . The monument in Napa was to represent just the 2 of them , swept into a full-moon lake of mangroves , left hanging in trees like ornaments , though of course the design would have to be something beyond , as if representing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California tribute was to sit on 400 obscenely private acres , it would become a well-known thing , famously endowed , famously elegiac . It had already been written about in the architectural trade and popular press , as if there was a difference between them anymore , and , if secured , would inevitably lead to other commissions . No doubt . The jewel box site and predictably pending dumbass dustup over elitist venue mandated things be done just right . While Joan slept , ghosts of the battered , float-bloated dead wafted and moaned , debris-spun like dirty shredded cardboard Niagaran barrels , the hundreds of thousands never to be seen again deviously commingled with intransigent Katrina-killed old folks in attics ( again she thought of Mother ) , wet silvery heads jammed into memorabilia-choked roofs with their rictus mouths , Pontchartrain floaters and bloaters and jokey FEMA hieroglyphs on sodden walls of Sumatran mud and Gentilly lace . Upon awakening , Joan became uneasy , as if somehow her ARK 's desire and egoistic need to win said competition was unclean . It was the kind of dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mocha latte in a daze , bypassing the stainless steel Impressa , wondering with embarrassment when she gave the barista her order if she 'd actually forgotten to brush her teeth .
