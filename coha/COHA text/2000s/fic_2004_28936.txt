The Ships of Air Book Two of the Fall of Ile-Rien Chapter One So we made ready to leave the shore of the Isle of Storms , in hope of never setting foot on it again .  --  " Ravenna 's voyage to the Unknown Eastlands , " V. Madrais Translation Tremaine picked her way along the ledge , green stinking canal on one hand , rocky outcrop sprouting dense dark foliage on the other . She was exhausted and footsore and at the moment profoundly irritated . She said in exasperation , " All they have to do is get on the damn ship . Is that really going to be so hard ? " " It 's the eyes , " Giliead told her obliquely . He and Ilias were just ahead of her on the narrow shelf of rock , both men having a far easier time of traversing it than she was . The mossy water a few feet below was foul-smelling and stagnant , inhabited only by weeds and the occasional brightly colored snake . These canals cut through the rocky island in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that housed entrances to the deserted waterlogged city that wove through the caves below . The builders , whoever they were , had used black stones twenty or thirty feet long to line the watercourse , stacking them like tree trunks in the same way they built their underground walls and bridges . " The ship does n't have eyes . " Tremaine struggled along , sweating in the damp air . The canal was overhung by the twisted dark-leaved trees ; the overcast sky made it even more dim . For years the island had been a trap for seagoing vessels and the crews who sailed them ; the whole place felt as if the corruption in the caves below had crept up through the roots of the stunted jungle . " That 's the problem , " Giliead said , glancing back at her as he brushed a branch aside . " She just looks like  --  " " A big blind giant , " Ilias supplied , balancing agilely on the slick stones . They were both Syprians , natives of this world on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adoption , and they looked nothing alike . Ilias had a stocky muscular build and a wild mane of blond hair , some of it tied into a queue that hung down his back . He wore battered dark pants and boots with a sleeveless blue shirt trimmed with leather braid . Giliead was built on a bigger scale , nearly a head taller than Ilias , with chestnut braids and olive skin , dressed in a dark brown shirt under a leather jerkin . Both wore more jewelry than had been fashionable for men in Ile-Rien for many years  --  copper earrings , armbands with copper disks . Ilias also had a silver mark on his cheek in the shape of a half-moon , but that was n't meant to be decorative . Tremaine let out a frustrated breath as she ducked under a heavy screen of pungent leaves . She was the odd woman out , with short mousy brown hair and sunburned skin . She was wearing Syprian clothing too , a loose blue tunic block-printed with green-and-gold designs and breeches of a soft doeskin . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better shape than the unlamented tweed outfits she had left behind in Ile-Rien . At the moment all three of them were covered with bruises , howler scratches and patches of mud and slime from the walls of the underground passages.The last few days had been nothing but fighting and running and swimming and falling , and Tremaine just wanted everyone to quietly get on the ship so they could get the hell away from here . She had also gone to a great deal of trouble to steal the Queen Ravenna for just this purpose and she wanted her new friends to like it . So far they had stubbornly refused to share her enthusiasm . Even Ilias , who had actually sailed on the ship briefly . " It wo n't matter how big the ship is as long as she sails by curses , " Giliead continued frankly . " They 're never going to get used to that . " Tremaine knew he was probably right , though she was n't ready to admit it aloud . Syprian civilization was considerably more primitive than Ile-Rien 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clocks , as magical.Worse , Syprians hated magic , since all their sorcerers were murdering lunatics . It was a minor miracle that they had managed to get to this point , where a woman from Ile-Rien who was a friend of sorcerers could talk about this subject with Syprians at all . It helped that they were a sea people and fairly cosmopolitan , despite their prejudices . " But the Ravenna does n't use magic , " she pointed out . " The steam engines  --  " She stopped when she realized the words were coming out in Rienish . If there was a Syrnaic word for " steam engine " the translation spell that had given Tremaine the knowledge of the language had n't seen fit to include it . " There 's boilers , and you put water in them , and burn coal or oil or something , and the steam makes it go . It 's not magic , " she finished lamely . Giliead and Ilias paused to exchange a look ; Giliead 's half of it was dubious and Ilias 's was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in . He had spent nearly one whole day in Ile-Rien and now qualified as the local expert . " Wagons without horses , wizard lights , wizard weapons , there 's an explanation for everything . " Giliead shook his head as he started forward again . " If that 's our only way off the island , we 're going to have trouble . " Ilias nodded . " It does n't matter about me , I 'm marked anyway , " he said matter-of-factly . The mark he spoke of was the little half-moon of silver branded into his cheek . It was what Syprian law said anyone who had ever fallen under a sorcerer 's curse should wear . " And Gil 's exempt from the law because he 's a Chosen Vessel , but it 's the others I 'm worried about . If the people in Cineth harbor see them come off that ship , they could all end up ostracized or worse . And some of the younger ones come from pretty good families , they could still have a chance of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
