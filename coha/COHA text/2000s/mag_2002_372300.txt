KNIFE LIFE Was there anything swanker than the foldout scissors on your Swiss Army knife ? O.K. , maybe the toothpick . But even that pales in comparison with the newest feature on Swiss Army 's stylish Voyager knife ( $70 ) : a digital alarm clock . Think of the possibilities . Now , besides uncorking bottles , screwing screws , picking teeth and opening cans of smoked sprats , you can be awakened before reveille . <P> DISC THROWING So did you finally go out and buy a DVD player ? Well , now a consortium of electronics makers is working on a new , incompatible DVD standard . The platform will play only so-called Blu-ray discs , which are encoded using short-wavelength blue-violet lasers to burn extra-narrow tracks of data . The new discs will hold roughly 27 gigabytes  --  about five times standard capacity , or enough room for 13 hours of TV shows . Look for new Blu-ray players in late 2003 , if you have any room left on your component shelf . <P> TONING UP The Sony Net MD media player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who like music with their workouts . It features G-Protection jostle proofing , can record CDs via a PC without copying anything to the hard drive and uses $2 MiniDiscs , which hold up to 110 hours of music . You ca n't simply drag song files from your computer and drop them onto the player , but you can record at high-capacity 32X , which is pretty buff . <P>  --  By Roy B. White
