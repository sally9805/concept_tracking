<p> " Hot Enough For You ? " <p> <p> I had been minding my own business as I waited at the crosswalk , but this made me look over . The person  --  sort of  --  who asked the question was easily six foot two . His bald head was an ominous medley of red and black , with small horns scattered about . His eyes were blazing yellow . He had to weigh in at three hundred plus pounds , and his robes were thick , some rough weave , in a solid black . He was sweating profusely . <p> <p> " Sure is , " I finally said , before getting jostled by a group of hobbits , with pointy ears and curly hair , who were apparently complaining about their hotel room . The big guy was still staring at me expectantly , and I found myself adding , " But back home in New York , it 's hot and humid . Like they say , at least this is a dry heat . " <p> <p> " Oh ? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I immediately regretted giving him the opening . He had successfully initiated a conversation . I should 've known better . " The city ? I love the city ! I was there for a different convention , a few years ago . . . " <p> <p> " No . Groverton . " I watched him stare at me blankly , then I laughed . " It 's a tiny town , upstate . " <p> <p> " So you 're just in San Diego for the Comic-Con ? " <p> <p> " Um , yup , " I said . <p> <p> " I 'm Chad Pennington , " he said . " I 'm local . Oh , and I 'm also Darth Maul . " <p> <p> " I 'm Lisa Falloya , " I answered politely , before gesturing to my non-costume clothes . " And . . . I 'm not anything else . " <p> <p> Just then the crosswalk sign lit up and I started moving , carried by the wave of the convention-goers . I darted ahead , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wars guy , and I knew from experience that most Star Wars guys could talk for hours . I just wanted to get to the convention and find my friends Stacy and Perry and maybe convince them to go home a day early . <p> <p> It was n't that the convention was too weird , even though I was surrounded by people dressed as everything from comic-book and video-game characters to monsters and , in one funny incident , a human Three Musketeers bar . Actually , I liked the atmosphere . I even liked the people . Darth Maul , my crosswalk buddy , was probably a very nice guy , if possibly overtalkative . <p> <p> It was n't the city . As far as cities went , San Diego was really as lovely as everyone said . It was eighty-nine degrees , and locals were acting like it was the apocalypse . If this were Groverton , people would be commenting on how unseasonably balmy the day was . The sky was an impossible blue , and the air was bone dry . It was as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweltering heat . <p> <p> And it was n't that I missed my boyfriend , Ethan . . . although I did , terribly , because I always did when I was traveling . Of course , it was n't like I traveled extensively , either . In fact , my annual trek ( no pun intended , for those Star Trek fans I felt sure were crawling around ) to the Comic Book Convention every August was the only traveling I did . Which was why I was now feeling the aftereffects . <p> <p> " There you are ! " <p> <p> I finally saw Stacy and Perry , my two best friends , walking toward me . Stacy was a short , somewhat stocky redhead with a matronly disposition . Thirty-four years old , she looked like a cross between a fairy godmother and a linebacker . Perry , on the other hand , was very tall , almost six-five , with corn silk blond hair . He was whipcord thin and lanky . Even at twenty-eight , he looked like he was maybe nineteen . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a Green Lantern icon T-shirt . <p> <p> " You missed so much , " Stacy said , sounding out of breath . <p> <p> " It 's only ten thirty , " I pointed out . <p> <p> " Yeah , but they were showing movies this morning . I got to see Steamboy , " Stacy gushed . <p> <p> " You 've seen that like thirty times , " Perry pointed out . " I met a few cool artists and got my Camelot 3000 copy signed . Finally . " <p> <p> " Cool . " We were all friends in geek , as Stacy used to say . It was nice to have best friends like this , the same since junior high . Apparently , it was really rare . " I was tired , though . " <p> <p> " Staying out too late , huh ? " Perry said . <p> <p> " Yeah . You guys both know I do n't get out much at home , " I said , with a sheepish grin . " Ethan usually stays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only go out for our anime club . " I decided to lay the groundwork for my next request . " Besides , you know I do n't really get along with traveling . . . " <p> <p> " It 's a nice change for me , " Stacy said , her voice positively perky despite only getting a few hours of sleep . " Between Roger needing to get up early to go to work and Thomas only being two and a half . . . that whole first year , I was getting no sleep . I was n't even getting a shower every other day , much less going out ! " <p> <p> " Well , at least you 're back at the Con , " I said . " You 've had a great visit , and I 'm sure you miss Roger and Thomas anyway . . . " <p> <p> Stacy sighed as the three of us joined the crowd crushing into the convention center . " Yeah , but I do n't know how long I 'll be able to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . Maybe trying for a girl , this time . So this could be my last Comic Convention for a while . " She sounded strained , as if perkiness was warring with the grimness of that announcement . <p> <p> " Yeah , but Thomas was totally worth it , " I reminded her . He was my godson , after all , and he was an amazing kid . I was starting to feel a bit bad at what I was about to ask . " The thing is . . . " <p> <p> Perry rolled his eyes . " No , Lisa , you ca n't go home early . " <p> <p> I blinked at him . " How 'd you know ? " <p> <p> Even Stacy shook her head . " Because you do this every year . You 're fine the first day or two , but by day three you 're dragging , and by the fourth day you 're begging to catch an earlier flight . " <p> <p> " And you 'd realize that every year we tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave now , you 'll miss the announcement ! " <p> <p> I quavered internally . That was a big part of why I was so gung-ho on leaving early , I had to admit . <p> <p> This year I 'd actually entered one of my hand-drawn comics in a competition . The company was a big Japanese publisher , one that I 'd been reading for years , and when I saw that they were asking for entries from the United States , I 'd allowed myself a glimmer of hope . <p> <p> Of course , I 'd probably have left it a glimmer if it had n't been for my meddling friends . Once Stacy and Perry found out , I 'd had to flight them as they browbeat me for another month to enter one of my amateur comics in the thing . So I 'd closed my eyes , held the proverbial gun to my head , and pulled the trigger by mailing that sucker in . <p> <p> Today , I 'd find out if I made it . <p> <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to argue my case for leaving early and to try and quell my own hopes . Why get worked up ? I probably had a better chance of winning the lottery . " You guys both know that . I mean , how many people here probably entered ? " <p> <p> " It 's a great story , and your drawings were cute , " Stacy argued . " Come on ! It 'll be another half-hour . We need to get to that pavilion . " <p> <p> " I should get something to eat , " I said , trying to postpone the inevitable . <p> <p> The thing was , I 'd had the dream for the past few months . This probably sounds totally pathetic , but once I heard the winner announced , and if it was n't me , well , I would lose that delicious feeling of possibility . <p> <p> Of course , the counterargument would be , but what if I won . It was a traitorous internal voice , the same one that had prompted me to start drawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to ignore it . Nothing broke your heart like that little voice , I swear to God . <p> <p> " I 'll meet you guys at the Sansoro Publisher booth , " I said , and they nodded , although Perry made a menacing gesture  --  you 'd better be there , he seemed to say . <p> <p> I headed for the hideously overpriced concession stand , intent on grabbing a hamburger , fries , and a Coke . The breakfast of conventioneers , I thought with a grin . But before I could get on line , my cell phone vibrated in my pocket . I glanced at it , then smiled . <p> <p> " Hi , Ethan , " I answered , ducking into a corridor and covering my other ear with my hand . " It 's so good to hear from you . I miss you ! " <p> <p> " How are things at Nerd Central ? " he asked , then laughed . " Been picked up by any more Star Trek guys ? " <p> <p> " Star Wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me into a conversation at the crosswalk , but I escaped . " <p> <p> He chuckled again . " How 's it going ? Homesick yet ? " <p> <p> We 'd been going together for three years now , and he knew me probably better than anybody . " Terribly homesick , " I admitted without shame . If you could n't be puny and miserable with your boyfriend , then he was n't much of a boyfriend , right ? " But it 's just another day and a half . " <p> <p> " That 's my girl , " Ethan said . " It 's good for you to get out . " <p> <p> He was always saying stuff like that . The only non-Con travel I 'd done was with him : a vacation to Florida , a trip to Toronto , even a trip to meet his parents near San Francisco . Being with him did ease the traveling malaise , just like being with Stacy and Perry helped . Usually because they would n't let me wallow in it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Working hard ? " <p> <p> " I 'm just getting stuff closed out and ready for when the semester starts up again in September , " Ethan said . <p> <p> " I thought you could coast this year , relatively speaking , " I said , . finally getting on line behind a couple dressed as Superman and what I had to assume was Lois Lane , circa 1940 . " I mean , it 's your last year . " <p> <p> " Yeah , but I 'm going to try to get a different job , maybe in the city , remember ? " <p> <p> Of course I remembered . I 'd known about The Plan , as he called it , since the day I met him . I think he 'd somehow worked it into his pickup line . We 'd introduced ourselves , said what we did . He 'd said , " I 'm Ethan Lonnel , and I 'm getting my MBA before getting a job in the city . Probably a director of operations . " <p> <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Philson semiconductor plant in Groverton . Everybody I knew , practically , worked at The Plant , as they called it  --  it being so huge and overpowering that it needed no further clarification . I had a job , and that was as far as it went . He , on the other hand , had A Plan . Or rather , The Plan . <p> <p> " That 's awfully together of you , " I 'd said , impressed . " You sound like you like what you do . " <p> <p> " I love what I do , " he 'd answered , and his grin had been amazing . <p> <p> " I like a man who loves what he does , " I 'd found myself saying , even though I suddenly realized I had rarely met anyone , man or woman , who . t that description . We 'd been together ever since . <p> <p> " So I need to ace this year , especially the outside projects , " he said . " I 'm going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed silently . I barely saw Ethan these days as it was . I knew better than to complain , though . Not that he 'd reprimand me or anything . It would just make him feel guilty , which would make me feel bad since I knew how important The Plan was to him . It was better to just avoid discussing anything but details . <p> <p> " Do n't worry . After June , it 'll all get better , " he promised , and I knew that , too . " But , yeah , until June it 's going to be rough . I wo n't get to see you that much . " <p> <p> I made a little noise of acceptance , a sort of yuh-huh , even as I felt loneliness curl around the edges of my consciousness . " Well , it 's just a year , " I said , with forced perkiness . <p> <p> " Then , everything we promised , " he said , and I warmed at the tone of his voice . " Hell , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . You should take advantage of it . Go out and raise hell with your friends . See the world . Stuff like that . " <p> <p> " Oh , you know me , " I said , motioning to what food I wanted and paying the cashier for it . " World-traveling hell-raiser . " <p> <p> " I just feel bad , having to leave you alone all the time , " Ethan said . <p> <p> " No problem . " I grabbed my tray of food and juggled the phone . " You 're worth it . " <p> <p> " That 's definitely my girl , " he said . " Listen , I got ta go . . . need to buy books and stuff . I 'll call you tonight . " <p> <p> " Love you , " I said , reluctant to lose contact . <p> <p> " Love you , too . " He hung up . <p> <p> As I made my way to the Sansoro booth , I tucked the phone into my pocket , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of whom were undoubtedly anime and manga buffs  --  that is , all fans of the Japanese cartoons and comics that we , meaning me and all my friends , were wild about . They were talking in low , excited murmurs . There was a delegation of people from the publisher up on the stand , and the podium was empty but spotlighted  --  obviously waiting for the grand announcement . <p> <p> " Did I miss anything ? " I asked , before taking a bite of burger . I grimaced at Perry when he stole a fry . <p> <p> " Not a thing . But any minute now , " Stacy said , unable to keep still in her seat . <p> <p> I plowed through my food , as if eating would somehow force my jittery stomach to focus on something other than the impending announcement . I finished , and they still had n't said anything , so I got up to throw out my trash , making my way over people 's feet , since Stacy and Perry had grabbed seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash can when a man stepped up to the podium . <p> <p> " We at Sansoro were very pleased at the number of entries that came in for our very first American manga contest , " he said . He was Japanese , but his accent was very slight . " The entries themselves were very impressive , and we had a very difficult time picking out only one final winner . The judging process went as follows . . . " <p> <p> The pleasantries went on for a while , and I was seriously considering just hovering along the edges of the crowd , and then bailing before Stacy and Perry could see me . Just for a little while , just to get my bearings . Do n't get your hopes up , do n't get your hopes up , I muttered to myself , pressing my hands against my stomach . <p> <p> The burger was probably a bad choice . <p> <p> I would find out in a second . Then , after the letdown ( which I 'd felt so many other times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch a movie or check out the other booths ; then I 'd get to pack and go home , back to the routine . Not that thrilling , admittedly , but . . . <p> <p> " And the winner is . . . sertgh burglethetir ! " <p> <p> I stared . The microphone had burbled , or something . That had made no sense . <p> <p> The crowd was applauding , and I had the vague impression that Stacy and Perry were screaming . Yes , screaming . <p> <p> The Japanese man at the podium scanned the crowd . " Is she here today ? We were told she 'd registered . " <p> <p> I stared at Stacy and Perry , who were gesturing to me wildly . What the hell had just happened ? Did I have an aneurysm and miss it , or something ? <p> <p> The man cleared his throat . " I repeat . . . the winner of the grand prize of a one-year internship at Sansoro Publishing is . . . Lisa Falloya ! " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . <p> <p> " Well , of course you 're going , " Stacy said , taking a long drink from her milk shake . " Tell me you 're going ! " <p> <p> " I have another week to make up my mind , " I said defensively . <p> <p> I had all but passed out , hearing I 'd won the contest . Now we were back in Groverton , sitting at MegaBurger after an anime club meeting , having our usual shakes and burgers . And from the moment that I had discovered I 'd won , I 'd had a barrage of commentary from Stacy and Perry . <p> <p> " Why the hell would n't you go ? " Perry asked , before taking a huge bite of burger and devouring it in nanoseconds . For a skinny guy , he could really pack it away . " It 's Japan , for chrissake ! Only the coolest place on earth ! Do you know what I 'd give to live over there for a year ? To get somebody else to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " So you go , " I said , only half joking . <p> <p> " Oh , do n't start with that , " Stacy snapped . " You 've got an opportunity to see how a manga publisher works . We 've only been reading the stuff for forever , and you get to actually spend a year doing something other than order semiconductor parts ! You 've got to be insane to not see how phenomenal that is ! " She dipped a fry into the pool of ketchup she had smeared on her plate . " I 'm with Perry . I would kill to do what you 're going to do ! " <p> <p> " And you could come back , and tell everybody you were a mangaka ! " Perry said , as if that settled the argument completely . <p> <p> " I would n't make it to manga-ka , " I said , using the term that meant manga artist . " I keep reminding you , I 'm American . They do n't make Americans manga-ka . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Perry countered . " They 're changing . " <p> <p> " Not according to my mother , " I argued back , uncomfortable with the pressure . " And seeing as she is Japanese , she ought to know . " <p> <p> Perry rolled his eyes , and Stacy tsked the comment away with a wave of her hand , almost knocking her metal cup with extra milkshake over . " Your mom has n't lived in Japan for what , forty years ? Japan 's changing . I 've read about it . Besides , you won the contest , did n't you ? You got the internship ! Why would they do that if they did n't want you to be a manga-ka for a year ? " <p> <p> I kept quiet . I loved my friends , but they 'd lived in Groverton all their lives  --  same as I had , come to think of it . But the difference was , they were n't Japanese , or half-Japanese , or even Asian . <p> <p> I knew there was a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them without sounding racist . And even if I could manage to sound rational , they still would n't believe me . It was an American thing , I knew  --  people changed , it did n't matter where you came from , as long as you worked hard and had the talent , you could go where you wanted to go . <p> <p> " Besides , it 's not just that , " Perry said . " You 're just , you know , being a punk . " He grinned at that . <p> <p> " I do hate traveling , " I said , refusing to rise to the bait . <p> <p> " But it 's Japan . " Stacy 's tone sounded almost rapturous . " You can see that fish market , and all the kids in Harajuku , and the commuters . . . and those massive screens and . . . " She gestured , as if words failed to capture just how unbelievable the whole thing would be . " And you 'd be getting paid ! " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to put a damper on the whole thing . I was jazzed that I 'd won the internship , but in my mind , I had done what I had set out to do . Sure , I was n't crazy , a part of me would love to go , but it just seemed like a huge hassle . " It 's a small stipend . I mean , it 's an internship . And it 's expensive to live in Tokyo . Way more expensive than here , anyway . " Just number fifteen on my list of why it 's a bad idea to go to Tokyo . <p> <p> " You 've got savings , " Stacy said stubbornly . <p> <p> " Besides , it does n't have to be expensive , " Perry said . " Remember Yukari ? " <p> <p> " Uh , no , " I said . " Should I ? " <p> <p> He rolled his eyes at me . " She 's my pen pal from Tokyo . " <p> <p> Stacy and I shared a grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed . He made his preference for Asian women no secret . I 'd occasionally wondered if that was why he initially befriended me , even though we 'd never been anything close to romantic . " Do n't tell me you 're getting one of your hoochie mamas to hook me up with an apartment , " I said . <p> <p> " She 's not a hoochie mama . " Perry finished his burger in one enormous , fierce bite . He always took umbrage about this sort of thing . " She 's a nice girl . Twenty-one , out of university but still living at home with her parents and her kid brother . I 'm sure they would be up for taking in a boarder . You could stay with them , and it 'd be a lot cheaper than renting an apartment or even a gaijin house . " <p> <p> I have to admit , I did look into housing . Gaijin housing was housing specifically meant for Westerners or foreigners . They were usually tiny , with a shared bathroom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were cheap , they were probably in ghettos . Not what I really was looking forward to . <p> <p> " How do you know they 'd be interested ? " <p> <p> Perry smirked . " Already asked her . " <p> <p> " Jesus , Perry . " It was one thing to be helpful ; this was bordering on blackmail . <p> <p> " Listen , if we left it up to you , you 'd come up with excuse after excuse until the deadline had passed , " Stacy said , defending Perry . " I looked up airfares . I looked up what it would take for you to get your passport . I looked up what it would take to get a work visa . " <p> <p> " They 'd take care of that , " I said automatically , then blushed as I realized that they were looking at me with some smugness . <p> <p> " So you do want to go ! " Stacy almost crowed it . <p> <p> " So I 've read the paperwork , big deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of fries . " I did n't just ignore this . I 've done some research . And it 's not like I said I do n't want to go . " <p> <p> " Could 've fooled me , " Perry muttered . <p> <p> " It 's just . . . okay . Yes . I 'm scared , okay ? " I crossed my arms , leaving half of my burger uneaten . " It 's a big , huge change , and I 'm scared silly . " <p> <p> Now Perry and Stacy eased off . " At least you 're being honest about it , " Stacy said , and she reached over to pat me on the hand . " But honey , it 's time . This is such a huge opportunity . What are you scared of ? " <p> <p> " I wo n't know anybody . My Japanese is so totally rusty . . . I can get by with speaking it , for the most part , but the written is terrible . " I sighed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going over it every day for the past month . " I get lost at the drop of a hat . I get horrible jet lag . I do n't know what they 'd expect of me . I get homesick when I leave for just five days . " <p> <p> They listened , quietly , supportive . <p> <p> " I do n't know . Maybe some people are just cut out for small-town living , " I expanded . " I love Groverton . I still have my best friends from high school . It 's just . . . nice here . Comfortable . " I sighed heavily and took a sip of my shake  --  chocolate peanut butter . What were the odds I 'd find a chocolate peanut butter shake in Tokyo ? " It 'd be great , from a certain standpoint , but after a year it 'd be all over . So why go in the first place ? I 'm happy here . " <p> <p> Stacy and Perry looked at each other . " Want to take this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> <p> " Go for it , " Stacy replied . <p> <p> Perry turned to me , his eyes filled with compassion and understanding . <p> <p> " Lisa , honey , " he said , " that is the biggest bunch of bullshit I have ever heard in my life . " <p> <p> I sat up straight , as if I 'd been goosed . " I beg your pardon . " <p> <p> " You 're scared , you admitted it , " he said . " And fear 's the only thing that 's kept you in Groverton all these years . Yeah , we 're cool and all , but we 're not the reason you stayed . And it 's not because it 's so nice . I mean , it 's not like you love your job . " <p> <p> " I . . . " I fell quiet . He was right . I was a desk jockey at The Plant  --  the same place where Stacy worked . Half the time I was stressed out , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking busy . " Well , that was blunt . " <p> <p> " And you do n't like your apartment . " <p> <p> " It 's not so bad , " I said , thinking of my little studio apartment . Sure , it still had that college graduate still-in-boxes , Ikea chic thing going , but hell . . . <p> <p> " Face it . Your life is n't a Frank Capra movie , " Perry said , in his best Jack Nicholson tough-love voice . " It 's just less work than going out and doing what you want to do . " <p> <p> " So why are you two still in Groverton if I 'm such a bum ? " I did n't mean it to come out that harshly , but damn it , I felt under attack here . <p> <p> Perry 's smile was sad . " I did n't say that we were better than you , " he said . " I know that part of me just desperately wants to live vicariously through you . You 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I 've got Roger and my son , " Stacy said . " I 'm not going anywhere . " <p> <p> They looked at me , like I was the Great White Hope or something . I felt like a slug . <p> <p> " There is one other thing , " I said , although it was a feeble hope . " Ethan . I do n't want to leave Ethan . " <p> <p> Stacy shook her head . " Does Ethan want you here ? " <p> <p> I felt my eyes widen . " Of course he wants me here ! " <p> <p> " Did he tell you not to go ? " <p> <p> I thought Ethan was my ace in the hole , the one factor that was inarguable . " No , " I admitted . " But then , I did n't really ask him , either . " <p> <p> " So there you go , " Perry said . " Let Ethan be the final factor . If he does n't mind you going , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> <p> I sat and stared at my so-called helpful friends , who stared back . I was very aware of the clatter of the other diners , the smell of the burgers and fries from the kitchen , the sticky-smooth feel of the booth 's red vinyl seat on my back . <p> <p> " I 'm staying at Ethan 's tonight , " I finally said . " I 'll talk to him . " <p> <p> " That 's all we 're asking , " Perry said . <p> <p> " You guys are insanely pushy , " I added , a grumbling footnote . <p> <p> " Yeah , but that 's part of why you 're friends with us , " Stacy said . <p> <p> " You did n't want to go to the Con with us , either , remember ? And now you go every year . " <p> <p> " It 's all about that first leap , " Perry agreed . <p> <p> " Well , thank God I have you two to push me off the cliff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milkshake . Unable to stay pissy in the face of such joviality , I joined in . <p> <p> Still , I felt foreboding at what I 'd agreed to . What would Ethan say ? He loved me , he wanted to be with me , I knew that . But he also wanted me to live a bigger life than I was living . He was the one with The Plan , after all . <p> <p> And honestly , what did I want him to say ? <p> <p> " HONEY , " ETHAN said , " I think you should go . " <p> <p> I let out a slow , frustrated breath and plopped down on Ethan 's stylish leather couch with a thud . <p> <p> For once , why could n't you be a possessive , overbearing boyfriend ? <p> <p> But I knew I did n't mean it . I 'd actually had one of those , thanks very much , right before Ethan . I 'd gotten enough from that relationship to realize I did n't need another . But still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to pack my bag for me , rankled . <p> <p> " You realize , of course , this means I 'm going away for a whole year , starting in January . " My voice was a dull monotone , just this side of sulking . <p> <p> " I know . I 'll miss you , " he said , and that was a balm of sorts . " But it 's such a great opportunity . " <p> <p> " If one more person says it 's a great opportunity , " I said , " I may scream . " <p> <p> Ethan ran a hand through his hair , causing the sandy brown curls to stick almost straight up . He looked terribly sexy that way , I thought . And I 'd be thousands of miles away from him for a whole year , making do with a photo . <p> <p> I was spending the night at his place , and I could see his dining room table was strewn with papers and binders and folders  --  all school stuff . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was eleven . At least it was Friday . Still , he looked frazzled . <p> <p> " I thought this was what you loved . The comic book stuff , " Ethan clarified , and instead of sounding warm , he sounded annoyed , and rightfully so , I thought with some guilt . Here he was , trying to be Mr. Supportive , and I was just being a pouty little whiner . " If you do n't want to go , do n't go . But if you ask me if I mind , then the answer is no . " <p> <p> I nodded , biting my lip . <p> <p> " And if you 're trying to use me as an excuse for you not to go . . . " He sat down on the couch next to me , frowning . " Then knock it off . Because that 's not going to work . " <p> <p> " You 're right , " I said . " I 'm sorry . I 'm just freaked out by the whole thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more gently this time , and I managed to feel like even more of a crumb . What the hell was my problem ? " I moved from Walnut Creek , California , to Groverton , New York , " he pointed out . " Three thousand miles . I know the feeling . And , yeah , it was a big change , but I got through it just fine . I met you , did n't I ? " <p> <p> I smiled when he winked at me . " But it 's different . You 're . . . " I moved my hands in an amorphous gesture , trying to put into words what I felt was impossible to define . " Different , " I finally said , somewhat lamely . <p> <p> " Not as different as you 'd think  --  " he started , but I interrupted him . <p> <p> " You 've always got a plan , and you stick to it . You know where you want to go , and absolutely nothing 's going to stop you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not like that . I 'm more of a go-with-the-flow girl . " <p> <p> " I know . That 's part of why we work so well together , " he said , and he kissed my cheek . Now I knew I 'd miss him , dreadfully , painfully . " But , sweetie , you ca n't just . oat through life . " <p> <p> " Sure you can , " I said , only half-joking . " I 've been doing it for twenty-eight years . " <p> <p> " What I mean is , you ca n't just be my sidekick . You need to have a life of your own . Do n't you want to have some adventures before we get married ? " <p> <p> There it was again  --  that little thrill , and that little tension , at the thought of it . Married to Ethan . It was something I 'd dreamed about , but it was also probably the most permanent thing that would ever happen to me in my whole life . " What , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some pretty Japanese guys ? " I laughed , to show I was kidding . The thought of cheating on Ethan , on anybody , was pretty unthinkable . <p> <p> He was laughing before I was , I noticed . He knew it , too  --  the thought was pretty ludicrous . I was as monogamous as they came . " No , you know that . But you could tell our kids about your trip to Japan . How their mommy went all the way across the world to draw cartoons . " <p> <p> He made it sound like a big vacation or some kind of summer camp . I frowned , although I was n't sure why . <p> <p> " It 'd be over before you know it , " he coaxed . " You 'd be so busy , and seeing so much new stuff . The year would just . y by , I 'm sure . It 's been like that for me , with business school and work and all . I ca n't believe I 've been here for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blink . " <p> <p> I nodded , but in my mind it felt like we 'd been together for even more years than that  --  for practically forever . Maybe because my life was less busy , it seemed to move slower . " Well , I 'm sure it would n't be that bad , " I admitted . " And it 'd be new . And different . " <p> <p> " That 's the spirit , " he encouraged . <p> <p> " And I 've always wanted to see Tokyo , " I said , desperately trying to warm up to the idea . <p> <p> " Exactly ! " <p> <p> " And maybe . . . " I felt weird , voicing the dream aloud , even to the man I was going to marry , " maybe , if they like me , I could get a job . Work on more projects . Maybe they 'd actually publish some of my manga in books . " <p> <p> " That could always happen , " he said , in exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " <p> <p> I sighed . It was decided . " You really are trying to get rid of me , " I teased , my voice uneven . <p> <p> He sighed in response , surprising me . " Well . . . " <p> <p> My eyes widened . " Wait a sec . You mean you really want me out of here ? " <p> <p> " Not that way , " he amended , irritation back . " But , well , like tonight . " <p> <p> " What about tonight ? " <p> <p> " I 've got reading for three classes that I need to catch up on , " he said , pointing to the littered table . " I have a meeting on Monday that I need to get numbers ready for . I 've got a ton of things to do . Sometimes , it feels like my head 'll explode . You know I love having you over , Lisa . I love being with you . But . . . " <p> <p> " But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , God . I 'm sorry . " <p> <p> " It 's not a problem , " he said , then laughed weakly . " I mean , yeah , it is a problem . But I hate it when I know that you 're just at home waiting , and that you 'd love to spend time with me . I guess that makes me a selfish asshole . " <p> <p> " Of course it does n't , " I said quickly . " Are you kidding ? If anyone 's the asshole here , it 's me . I mean , I know you 're under all this pressure . I 'm not making things any easier . " <p> <p> " It 's just . . . " He paused , and she could tell he was choosing his words carefully . " You know how you said I was driven ? That I always had a plan ? " <p> <p> " Yeah . " <p> <p> " I do have a plan , " he said , and his tone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . It 's how I function . But sometimes I see you , not really caring where you 're going . And . . . I wonder . " <p> <p> " You wonder , " I said , waiting for clarification . <p> <p> " This is a terrible time for me to bring it up , " he said , and he ran his hand through his hair again , looking less sexy , and more and more like Kramer from Seinfeld . He was really getting agitated . " I mean , I do n't want to get into all of this . But I 'll have midterms coming up pretty soon , and finals . . . and then I 'll set up interviews for better jobs , and still have next semester , and you know work 's not taking it easy on me . . . " <p> <p> I let him continue in that vein , trying to ignore that he was deliberately rushing away from the point that he 'd brought up . <p> <p> I see you not really caring where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're under a lot of stress , " I said , summarizing what he was going on about . <p> <p> " Exactly , " he said , and he let out a relieved breath . <p> <p> " And . . . it might even be easier , say , if I were busy somewhere else . " <p> <p> " I 'd feel less guilty , " he said . " That makes me a complete shit , but  --  " <p> <p> " Knock that off , " I said , and saw the look of surprise . I supposed my tone of voice was a little snippy . " You do n't have to keep beating yourself up for needing to take time to focus on your career . You worked hard to get here . I really do understand , Ethan . " <p> <p> " Well , good . " He paused , stroking my shoulder absently . " So , does that mean you 're going ? " <p> <p> I nodded . " Yeah , I guess so . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more determined . <p> <p> " Yes , " I repeated . " I am definitely going to Tokyo .
