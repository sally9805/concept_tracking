Baghdad nights are full of menace . The smoke of looted , burning buildings turns the sunset blood orange . Once darkness falls , tracer fire arcs across the sky like red fireworks . It 's dazzling but dangerous . One recent salvo came down on a gasoline tanker , setting off an explosion that killed a man and injured several others . <P> When the sun goes down , the streets empty quickly . Curfew unofficially begins at 11 p.m. , but few drivers , even those earning dollars from foreigners , stay out that late . One learns to fear the shadows that move . Gunfire punches holes in the city 's eerie quiet . Two sharp cracks signal an American checkpoint firing warning shots . Rapid automatic fire sounds the news that electricity has returned to a neighborhood . Most ominous of all is the single shot . <P> One evening last week a small crowd gathered around two men lying on the central divider of Saadoun Street an hour after nightfall . We stopped our car for a closer look . Both men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the other bleeding from a bullet hole in his right eye and struggling to breathe . The onlookers merely gawked at the grisly scene , muttering " Ali Baba , " Arabic slang for thieves . We did n't know if they meant the victims or the gunmen . <P> In a city virtually without civil authority since Saddam Hussein 's fall , many districts have organized vigilante night patrols to scare off looters and shooters . But these victims received no help : no phones work ; no police patrol the beat . None of the gawkers even lent a hand as we tried to lift the wounded man into our Daewoo sedan . It took several universally understood expletives to elicit help . <P> After a 15-minute dash across a city lighted only by a full moon , we pulled up at al-Yarmouk hospital , an over-burdened 700-bed facility guarded by U.S. troops . Frustrated staff members trying to practice lifesaving without morphine , stretchers or clean linen could do little . " We have no neurologist here , " a white-smocked doctor said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a wheelchair and pushed him to an emergency room filled with similar unfortunates . Medics hoisted him onto an unsheeted gurney and hooked up a bag of saline . Doctors said he was the 12th gunshot victim in five hours ; before the war , they might have handled one such case a day . On another gurney lay a man doctors described as a would-be carjacker , knifed in the lung . Nearby moaned a man with a bandaged right hand he claimed was hurt when he tried to stop a thief . A third patient , writhing on a bed , had taken a bullet in the kidney after escaping a botched theft , hospital aides said . The doctors in the emergency room face a painful dilemma : many who come to be saved are routinely threatening others ' lives . Among them are surely some of the thousands of common criminals set free by Saddam 's 11th-hour amnesty . " They 've misused their freedom , " said Dr. Farkad Joseph , one of the hospital 's doctors .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
