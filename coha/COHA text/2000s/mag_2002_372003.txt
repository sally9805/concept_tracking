For argument 's sake , let 's concede the point that everyone in the White House has been at such pains to make : No one in the Bush Administration lifted a finger to save Enron from collapse . But that does n't mean the $6 million in campaign contributions the company and its executives gave to politicians over the past 12 years should be written off as a bad investment . For most of that time , Enron 's Washington friends did pretty much whatever the company wanted . <P> What Enron wanted most was to be left alone , free of both regulation and scrutiny as it transformed itself from a dowdy natural-gas-pipeline company into a freewheeling **25;14215;TOOLONG giant . In the early 1990s Enron became a new kind of business , selling not just energy but exotic financial instruments such as energy futures and options . The company moved the heart of its operations from the oil patch to the trading floor  --  largely free of regulatory baggage , thanks to allies such as Wendy Gramm . In 1993 , as chairwoman of the Commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy trades from government regulation . That meant Enron could operate an online energy market that , unlike traditional stock and commodity exchanges , did not have to disclose the price , volume or terms of the contracts it sold . Gramm left government that year and was given a lucrative spot on the Enron board . She is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gramm , to whom the company has donated $97,000 since 1989 . <P> There were also times Enron found a little government intervention came in handy . When India delayed approval of Enron 's $3 billion power plant in Dabhol in 1996 , Clinton White House counselor Mack McLarty instructed the U.S. ambassador in New Delhi to monitor it and gave regular progress reports to Enron chairman Ken Lay . ( Four days before the project received its final O.K. , Enron gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee . ) And when Enron was trying to sell its interest in the Indian project , the New York Daily News reported , Vice President Dick Cheney raised the issue in a meeting last June with Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acting not at Enron 's behest but on the need to protect $640 million in federal money . <P> More often than not , Enron 's interests and the agenda of George W. Bush have been happily congruent . Enron has given Bush more than $700,000 in contributions over the years . Lay was disappointed last year when Bush backed away from a global-warming plan that would have been good for the natural-gas business , but Bush sided with the company in refusing to back price caps on California energy , of which Enron was a major supplier . Larry Lindsey , Bush 's top economic adviser and a former Enron consultant , has battled on free-market grounds to preserve the kind of overseas tax shelters that hid Enron 's true financial condition for so long . And in August Lay 's backing helped put his friend Patrick Wood at the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , replacing a chairman who had opposed Enron 's deregulation timetable .
