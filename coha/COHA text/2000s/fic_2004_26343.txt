Jason and the Gorgon 's Blood Chapter One A Matter of Pigs The centaur was angrier than Jason had ever seen him before . He was so angry , he did n't just stamp his hooves and make the earth shake like a drum or roar till all the caves of Mount Pelion echoed with the sound . No , he was far too angry for that . He lined up the six boys and paced up and down before them in threatening silence , his hooves padding softly on the grass , his fists clenching and unclenching in a broken rhythm . His unspoken disapproval was like a heavy boulder pressing down on all of them , and Jason most of all . Especially , Jason thought , because my mouth is so parched and there is a dull throbbing behind my forehead and my limbs ache and I have bumps like small hillocks all over my body . He shook his head to clear it , which just made things worse . Why ca n't I remember why I feel this way ? Something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a revel before . " Chiron , master . . . " Prince Acastus began . He always used the centaur 's title when he wanted to wheedle his way out of trouble . But Chiron was not to be cozened . He was simply too angry . " Silence ! " Now he roared , and the sound of his voice shattered a small birch in two . And my head , Jason thought . Prince Acastus was smart enough to shut up , moving back behind his cousin Admetus . Jason wondered who would be the first of the boys to crack . Since Chiron had raised him from infancy , and he was used to the centaur 's ways , he knew he would not be the one . But these other boys had been on the mountain for only a matter of weeks , sent by their fathers to be trained as hunters , as warriors , as heroes . Sent to the master of all masters , the burly old centaur who was now pacing so angrily before them . Jason smiled at the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last the centaur halted in front of them and arched an accusing eyebrow . Jason hated that look most of all . It signaled some awful punishment was going to follow . And soon . " Pigs , " Chiron said , his voice throbbing and low , like a toothache . " Let us talk about pigs . " The centaur was intimidating enough even when he was not angry . With the body of a wild stallion , all sinewy strength and animal speed , crowned by the torso of a heavily muscled man , he radiated raw power . His bearded face had all the majestic grandeur of the mountain that reared up over their heads . " I say pigs , ' and how do you answer ? " Idas , the strongest of the boys , stuck out his chest and set his square jaw in defiance , trying hard to show that he was n't afraid , but nobody was fooled . They were all afraid of Chiron . Centaurs were , after all , bigger and stronger than any human adult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his breed . Different , apart  --  and a master teacher . Idas ' brother , wiry Lynceus , who swore he could spot an ant crawling up a tree trunk clear across the valley , right now had eyes glazed over in panic , as if he 'd gone blind . Tall , gangly Melampus of Pylos had a reputation as a seer . He boasted he could foretell the future by the movements of the birds , and indeed his mind always did seem to be drifting among the clouds . But a single glare from Chiron and he came crashing to earth , taking a nervous step backward . Admetus did n't even attempt to put on a show . His round , freckled face drooped , and he shuffled his feet nervously . Behind him Acastus crossed his arms , trying  --  Jason supposed  --  to look heroic . Hard to do , Jason thought , while hiding behind someone else . Acastus kept up the charade for almost five whole seconds before bowing his head under Chiron 's relentless gaze . Will he be merciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart under that brawny chest . How often had he seen the centaur stop to tend an injured bird , splinting a broken wing or applying a healing salve . But do we deserve his mercy ? Desperately Jason wished he could remember what it was they had done . Chiron turned his dark-eyed gaze down to the valley below . " I should have known from the sorry state you were in when you dragged yourselves home last night that you had left some sort of trouble behind you . " " Home ! " Acastus whispered contemptuously to Admetus , though Jason overheard . " What kind of home is a cave in the side of a mountain ? " Suddenly Chiron passed behind the boys and without warning swerved his massive body . His rump barged into Acastus , knocking the boy flat on his face . The others began laughing , but one glance from Chiron snuffed out their mirth . " A prince , " Chiron said in his teacher voice , " should be noted for the respect he shows others , not his insolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , He must have forgotten how sharp Chiron 's ears are . For an instant , rebellion flickered in the young prince 's eyes . Then he lowered his gaze , fixing his eyes on the ground as he fingered the golden amulet that hung around his neck , a symbol of the royal house of Iolcus . " Pigs , " Chiron said again . " They did not escape their pen without help . Now whose idea was it to set them loose ? " He scowled at them , but no one spoke . " Pigs ! " Chiron boomed . Another tree on the edge of the clearing shivered , lost its leaves . Silence fell again like a smothering blanket . It was Idas who spoke up at last . " We ca n't remember , " he said sullenly . " Whatever punishment is due , inflict it upon us all equally . " " Idas is right , " Lynceus chimed in after his brother . " Except maybe for the part about punishment .
