<p> Last month , Dee Brown watched the 2006 NBA draft alone . He was not alone this past week at the summer-league camp of the Utah Jazz . <p> " We had some rooms at a hotel in downtown Chicago the night of the draft , " Brown said . " There were family and friends watching in one room . I stayed alone in the other , just watching the whole thing take place . I wanted it that way . I wanted to watch alone , to follow every single moment , every single pick . " <p> For a 22-year-old regional basketball legend whose whole world could lie waiting behind the next pick in that draft , perhaps the solemnity and focus of a man alone is understandable . But what became clear that night , when the Jazz took Brown in the second round  --  No. 46 overall  --  is that Brown 's whole professional basketball career now lies waiting on the shores of the Great Salt Lake . <p> " When it got around No. 40 , when James Augustine went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , " said Deron Williams , Brown 's running mate in the backcourt of Illinois ' fabled NCAA runners-up in 2004-05 and himself the No. 3 overall choice by Utah in last year 's NBA draft . " I thought it was perfect , great , very exciting . " <p> Added Brown : " We 've worked together pretty successfully before . Why not again , only on an even bigger stage ? " <p> Brown and Williams are not Illini men alone as Jazz coach Jerry Sloan pointed his summer-league group toward play in the six-team Rocky Mountain Revue , which opened its one-week run at Salt Lake Community College on Friday night . Also on the 17-player Utah summer roster is free agent Roger Powell Jr. , another Champaign classic off of Bruce Weber 's unforgettables and the CBA Rookie of the Year last winter with the Rockford Lightning . <p> " Well , we all know each other , that 's for sure , " Brown said . " Maybe coach Sloan will use us as part of a unit . " <p> Any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloan , whose Jazz bottomed out at 26-56 two seasons ago and moved to 41-41 with Williams a key contributor this past season . He is the star member of Utah 's Rocky Mountain contingent , an ensemble that includes rookie first-rounder Ronnie Brewer of Arkansas , second-round power man Paul Millsap of Louisiana Tech  --  who was taken at No. 47  --  and NBA veterans Rafael Araujo , C.J. Miles , Robert Whaley and Hiram Fuller . <p> Brewer and Brown are represented by Chicago-based agent Henry Thomas Jr. , who also lists Heat megastar Dwyane Wade among his NBA clients . While Williams is expected to continue his rise as one of Sloan 's new leaders of the band this season , Brown is on the bubble to make the Jazz , and Powell is a long shot . <p> Of the 5-11 Brown , Kevin O'Connor , the Jazz 's senior vice president of basketball operations , told Utah media : " You try to pick guys in the second round that have a chance to play in this league . That 's what we did . Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he tall enough to play 35 minutes ? Probably not . Is he tall enough to play ? Yes . Guys like him just find a way . " <p> Brown will try to find his way into a Utah backcourt that became more congested this month with the acquisition of veteran point guard Derek Fisher from Golden State . The Jazz dealt Devin Brown , Keith McLeod and Andre Owens to the Warriors for Fisher , 32 , a 10-year veteran who has three championship rings from his time with the Los Angeles Lakers and has appeared in 117 playoff games . <p> At summer point of entry , Fisher logically would loom as the probable backup for Williams at point guard with Brown possibly third deep . But that discounts the fact that Williams played almost half of his rookie minutes as Utah 's two-guard and Brown played many minutes as the Illini 's two to Williams ' point during the fabled <p> 37-2 Illinois campaign in 2004-05 . <p> Further complicating the Utah rear guard is the presence of Brewer , who is expected to provide instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-slot when the Jazz opens training camp in the fall are expected to be the spotty teen Miles and the well-traveled Gordan Giricek . <p> " I 'll play where coach Sloan tells me to play , and I 'll do what coach Sloan tells me to do , " Brown said . " I like my chances , and I love the organization . " <p> Added Williams : " Dee will do whatever it takes to make it at this level just as he has at every other level . You know he will bring his passion , talent and intensity , and with his record , who would n't want that ? He can play point , he can play two . Whichever , you know he will bring energy and a winning attitude to whatever he is asked to do . ... He will succeed . " <p> While Brewer signed a graded rookie contract  --  worth approximately $1.3 million his first season  --  Brown and Millsap enter their first segment with Utah essentially on " make-good " deals . Both will be angling to land full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Jazz opened its summer season last week with three days of double sessions at the Zion 's Bank Basketball Center . The team 's first game in the Rocky Mountain Revue was Friday night  --  a 98-76 win over Atlanta in which Williams scored 16 points and Brown had 12 . Other teams in the Revue include Dallas , Philadelphia , Seattle and San Antonio . Utah , which lost to the 76ers 81-71 Saturday , will conclude its six-game summer slate against the Spurs on Friday . <p> In the meantime , Brown has temporarily been bunking with close chum Williams . Neither answers to " Oscar " or " Felix "  --  yet . <p> " It 's funny , " Brown said . " We were playing down in the gym in Champaign about a week before the draft , and I kept telling Williams , ' You know , your boys are going to pick me , and then I 'm going to stay with you every day . ' We were just joking , and then it happened , so I 've been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take some getting used to to be out here .
