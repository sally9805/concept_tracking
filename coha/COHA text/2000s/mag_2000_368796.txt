From an unseen hallway , Sade 's mournful voice floats into the TV studio like a ghost passing through a wall . She 's singing these words , " I 'm the king of sorrow ... " The vocalist is backstage at HBO 's comedy-interview program the Chris Rock Show . She 's just wrapped up rehearsals for her appearance on the program to promote Lovers Rock ( Epic ) , her first CD of new music in eight years . That 's a lifetime in pop : time enough for the Seattle rock scene to have exploded like a supernova and to have collapsed like a white dwarf , time enough for Britney Spears to have gone from an innocent grade schooler to a stripteasing teen queen , time enough for the rap-rock genre to have bulked up its market muscle like a steroid-popping Bulgarian weight lifter . Time has passed , but it has n't passed Sade by . Even when she 's singing sad songs , even when she 's just stretching her voice , she sounds as alluring as ever : " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Sade slips into a small dressing room . She politely asks the reporter who is with her for permission to light a cigarette and then proceeds to chain-smoke for the duration of the interview . She smiles readily and laughs often , but something soft and vulnerable in her seems to clench reflexively  --  like a baby 's fist around an adult 's finger  --  when personal questions are raised . She exhales anxious gray smoke . She 's not the interview type . <P> It 's fashionable to be a press-shy celebrity  --  to bemoan the loss of one 's privacy while simultaneously courting the cameras at movie premieres and fashion shows . But Sade comes by her press shyness honestly . On the Chris Rock Show , she just sings her song and never says a word . Like a comet making its celestial rounds , she appears in the star-studded celebrity heavens infrequently and almost only when she has new songs to perform . <P> This time around , Sade , 41 , has other things on her mind besides music . In her songs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King and Kiss of Life  --  she evokes a world of romance and longing , of continent hopping and heart breaking . Her lyrics mirror her life . Since the release of her last CD , the elegant Love Deluxe ( 1992 ) , Sade has divorced Spanish filmmaker Carlos Scola , taken up with Jamaican record producer Bob Morgan and , with Morgan , had her first child , Ila , now 4 . Says Sade : " My happiest moment was definitely when I was in the hospital holding Ila . I just looked at her , and I wanted the moment to go on forever . " <P> Sade has also encountered drama outside her romantic life . In 1998 a judge in Kingston , Jamaica , ordered an arrest warrant for Sade after she failed to appear at a hearing on reckless-driving charges . " It was n't really a traffic incident , to be honest , " says Sade , who claims that a Jamaican policeman tried to pressure her into giving him a bribe . " It got blown into some incredible farcical event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans never to return to the island .
