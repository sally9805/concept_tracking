VIDEO GAME JUNKIE While he 's supposed to be doing homework , my 14-year-old sneaks out his hand-held gaming system and plays with it . What should I do ? * Normally I would say that ensuring homework gets done should be a teen 's own responsibility - but your son needs some help to get to that point . First , you both need to understand that video games can easily get inside your head - so it is n't surprising your son has difficulty putting them away . Talk to him about the problem and have him monitor how much time he spends playing . I do n't recommend confiscating the games outright , as this can kick up an extreme reaction from your son , but if he still finds the gaming system too difficult to ignore , have him hand it over to you temporarily , while he does his homework . If your son seems to need more and more time gaming and becomes unusually irritable and miserable when denied access , he may be addicted , and you 'll have to wean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work with him to determine when and how this will happen . Keep computers and gaming devices in a common area of your home , not in his bedroom . If he has been sneaking to the games at night , move them to your bedroom . Be clear on the rules , remembering to remain patient and sympathetic while you 're doing this . The change wo n't be easy for your son , but with your support he can become responsible with his gaming . That said , if these suggestions do n't appear to be making a difference , consider seeking professional help for your teen . - Kathy Lynn , parent educator PREVENTING RINGWORM My four-year-old daughter caught ringworm at our community swimming pool . Is there anything we could have done to prevent this ? * Ringworm is a skin infection caused by a fungus . The rash typically looks ring-shaped and has a raised edge . It is flaky and quite itchy ; if the scalp is infected , there is often a bald spot where the rash forms . Yes , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person or by sharing combs and brushes . Treatment depends on whether the infection is on the skin or scalp , and you should see your doctor for a prescription . Kids should stay home from school or daycare and avoid sharing towels with other family members until after treatment has started . Now to answer your question about prevention : Remind your daughter to wash her hands frequently and have a shower soon after swimming . It may also help to wear flip-flops or water shoes on the pool deck . Keep in mind , though , that being active and social is important for your daughter 's development . The small risk of a very minor infection , such as ringworm , is far outweighed by the benefits of her enjoyment at the pool . - Diane Sacks , paediatrician WONDERING ABOUT RELIGION Our six-year-old has a strong aversion to religion , to the point where he gets upset when people pray or say grace In front of him . He says It 's because he does nt understand why someone would talk to someone they cant see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother-in-law Insists on buying him religious books , which he refuses to read . Will he be missing out on something crucial to his development if he does n't learn about religion ? * I do n't know if I would describe your son 's response as an aversion to religion as much as confusion or even distress about something he considers incomprehensible . Children your son 's age can be quite literal . Often , they can only believe someone exists if they can see him or her for themselves . Consider also that you and your husband may be communicating your religious views in subtle ways your son could be picking up on . It 's possible that he is rejecting religion in an effort to emulate you . At the same time , his resistance to reading religious books could simply be a response to the pressure he seems to be feeling from his grandmother to do as he 's told . While your son is just about to enter a phase of cognitive development that will likely allow him to handle the idea of prayer better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your decision as his parents . There are many ways a child can learn good human values and experience spiritual growth . Religion can be one of them , and so can family activities and community involvement . - Ruwa Sabbagh , psychotherapist REQUESTING TIME OUTS My three-year-old daughter has been asking to be put in time out . We cant figure out why . * Time out is a very misunderstood concept . It should not be used as a consequence for misbehaviour , but a chance to settle down when your daughter is frustrated , tired or stressed . The adult version is a coffee break . It 's a time to decompress , take a break from work and possibly socialize . Your daughter may be requesting time outs because she realizes that , occasionally , she needs a break . If this is the case , you are using time out appropriately , so go ahead and let her have the break she needs . On the other hand , if you are using time out as punishment , she may figure she has done something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third possibility is that she 's heard other kids being sent to a time out and thinks it 's cool . PEANUT PANIC Because our eight-year-old son has a serious peanut allergy , we 've been teaching all of our children the importance of food safety . At the same time , we do n't want to frighten them , especially the youngest , who freaks out when she sees nutty candy bars at the supermarket checkout . What 's the best way to handle this ? * Anaphylaxis can be a huge source of anxiety for parents , particularly when their allergic child reaches school age . At eight , your son has a growing understanding of how serious his allergy is , and may become increasingly anxious as a result . It sounds as if your youngest is picking up on those anxieties too . You can help by reassuring her that you , the parents , are in control and will keep her brother safe . While it is essential to teach all of your children about food safety so they will be appropriately wary , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's difficult to walk this fine line , but in order for your youngest to calm down , she needs to sense a greater calmness in the family unit . Consider ways to help yourselves and your allergic child feel less anxiety about this allergy . Have him work with you to choose safe foods , show him how to self-administer his epinephrine injector , and teach his friends what to do in an emergency . This will help your child to feel empowered and you to feel more trusting of his ability to cope with his anaphylaxis . These feelings of control will trickle down to your daughter and help her feel less frightened . BODY HAIR EMBARRASSMENT For the past couple of years , my 10year-old daughter has complained that she does nt want to wear shorts and short-sleeved shirts for gym class because the other students comment on her hairy legs and arms . What can we do to help ? Leg waxing and laser treatments involve more pain than I want her to submit to , and I 'm leery of chemical removal for long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body hair is related to family tendencies , and not due to a hormone issue . The fact that she is healthy and age 10 makes it unlikely that the hair growth is due to a hormone problem , but you should mention it at her next physical exam . Meanwhile , it sounds as though she has found a solution ( albeit temporary ) to her problem by dressing in a way that makes her comfortable . This is terrific . All ( and I mean all ) of us have to come to terms with the fact that our bodies do not look the way we might wish . If the hair really holds her back from enjoying normal fun activities , mild peroxide bleaching , shaving and waxing are all safe options . Just remember to let her lead this solution .
