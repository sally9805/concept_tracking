San Francisco , California Thursday evening , November 24th Twice now on the way back from dinner Diane Lacombe had aborted the process of lighting a stale cigarette . She 'd been dredging them from the depths of her purse  --  her emergency stash buried just in case she had to fall off the wagon some night  --  but once again she tossed the unlit cigarette into a street-corner trash can , pushing back her mane of auburn hair with an unsteady hand . Relaxing right now was an apparently useless quest , and the need to rummage for yet another cigarette was rising . She calculated the number of blocks back to her Mission District apartment and dug in her purse for an emergency package of chewing gum instead . Too much agony with nicotine patches to blow it all now . The Tonga Room had been fun , and all the more so since it was one of her dad 's favorites , set amid the elegance of the grand old Fairmont Hotel . Some of her best childhood memories centered around lush , elegant dinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and feminine , demonstrating impeccable manners and basking in family privilege and tradition . But this evening 's visit to that world had felt like a hologram . She could see it , but she could n't actuallytouch the old warmth of those moments , though nothing in the hotel had changed . Since she 'd left for college , the childhood years were now only glimpsed through a murky lens , as if they belonged to someone else . It was an awful feeling she was determined to change . A neighborhood tavern she 'd frequented over the years was just ahead and she decided to duck in for their usually pathetic attempt at an espresso . She took the tiny cup to a dark corner like an addict , placing her laptop case by her feet where she could keep an eye on it . Not for the first time she felt around in her coat pocket for the reassuring shape of the CD that she 'd intended to hand to her father at dinner . Just the thought of committing that act was the source of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small nuclear device , she thought . It would have killed him just as surely . What had she been thinking ? Diane knew that California State Senator Ralph Lacombe had wondered through coffee and dessert why his beautiful , educated , twenty-seven-year-old daughter was so jumpy and distracted . Fit and distinguished in his late fifties with a large trademark smile , his full head of dark hair belying his age , the senior Lacombe had sat in patient , paternal puzzlement waiting , Diane supposed , for the explanation which never came . All the normal subjects they had once shared in open father-daughter communication seemed flat and forced  --  the 49ers , the latest political betrayals in Sacramento , the plans for a summer Lacombe family reunion in the wake of her mother 's surrender to cancer  --  and nothing had reduced her jittery demeanor or ended her constant denials that anything was wrong . There she sat , elegant in a reasonably conservative , calf-length little black dress , smiling at him and lying her head off by saying none of the things that needed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she knew that he knew , but they played the game anyway , more like two strangers being courteous than familial confidants . And all the while the CD had been burning a hole in her heart . The last thing she wanted was to make him a casualty of what she had to do . How would he have reacted if she 'd been foolhardy enough to hand it over ? Would the most ethical man on earth fall to the level of ordinary mortal before her very eyes ? And how could he not ? How would the conversation have gone ? she wondered . Oh , here , Dad , just a little hard seismic evidence that the critics were right after all about your old friend Mick Walker 's Cascadia Island project , which means that not only is Mick going to be ruined , but my engineering firm may end up like Enron 's accountants , and , oh , by the way , you 'll probably be publicly accused of misusing your political influence on behalf of Walker for promoting his resort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could expect Ralph Lacombe to say , " Sure , Honey , you go on and do what you have to . Blow the whistle . Destroy everything . " Not even her father was that brave . Or foolish . He would end up asking her not to pull the trigger , and she would n't be able to stand his plea or her denial . No . It was going to be far easier to deal with the damage after the fact , even if that method was cowardly . The island was always a time bomb , Dad , she thought . Pity poor old Mick did n't know it in time . What she 'd found in the seismic test data meant that Cascadia Island off the Washington coast was too dangerous an outcropping to support any human habitation or facilities , and especially not a resort hotel and convention center . There was a massive split down the middle , a hidden fault line so profoundly active that Walker 's resort would end up pulled in two with any substantial earthquake . And that same data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain scientist in Seattle as validation of his discredited hypothesis about the entire island being some sort of sensitive seismic trigger . According to the paper he 'd published , Cascadia Island 's small , rocky mass was supposedly resting on the geological equivalent of a hair-trigger detonator connected to a massive fault zone deep within the Cascadia Subduction Zone . Other seismologists had loudly rejected Dr. Lam 's ideas , but he continued to insist that any significant vibrations from that island could set off a chain reaction of amplified resonant vibrations and trigger a great earthquake equal to or greater than the monster that tore through Alaska in 1964 . No one disputed the fact that the Cascadia Subduction Zone was one of the world 's most dangerous tectonic faults . But the idea that the pile drivers and explosives used to build Mick Walker 's world-class resort could uncork three hundred years of unrelieved tectonic strain was just too far out to be real . Diane sipped the last of the extremely bitter espresso and smiled to herself . Dr. Lam 's " Theory of Resonant Amplification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient to trigger major earthquakes , a little construction activity on a coastal island had no chance of doing it . Maybe the rocks below did amplify any compression waves from a pile driver or rock blasting , but such impacts were ridiculously puny against the massive forces of nature . Nevertheless , she was very glad for Dr. Lam and his theory . He was exactly the man she needed for the dirty work of blowing the whistle on the hidden fault her firm had apparently missed long before construction began . Diane felt her heart accelerating . The last thing she needed was more caffeine , but if she had to have an addiction , coffee was fairly benign , especially after wrestling nicotine to the mat . She stood to go . I 'm outta here . She picked up her laptop case , paid the tab , and left quickly , setting a course for her flat and trying to retain just enough situational awareness to avoid becoming a hood ornament on various passing trucks . There were millions of dollars at stake . Maybe even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how much she was about to damage Chadwick and Noble , the globe-girdling , prestigious firm that had reached down from the heavens of architectural engineering to pluck her from the newly graduated masses . She felt another brief and distant echo of guilt over that . The chairman , Robert Nelms , was a straight shooter , or so she 'd always believed . But how could he do anything but suppress , cover up , deny , and hide when he discovered what the real data said ? She recalled her first meeting with Robert Nelms so clearly . She , the Stanford graduate student shown into the elaborately decorated corner office . He , a man whose girth made him look like an amalgam of Charles Laughton , Raymond Burr , and Marlon Brando in his later years . The effect had been instant intimidation heaped on a towering platter of insecurity , even though Nelms could n't have been nicer , rising with surprising ease and polished courtliness to take her hand and welcome her . It was clearly an interview , as she had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy way he wore the mantle of power of the managing partner of such an august firm  --  not to mention his own impressive professional history as a brilliant engineer . She had left the office not only aching to work for Chadwick and Noble , but wanting to work for and please Robert Nelms in particular . The memory still made her feel good , eliciting an unbidden smile that quickly faded as she returned to the reality of what she was doing . What she was doing was disloyal in the extreme , and she professed to hate disloyalty . But her mission was righteous , and if it meant she had to repay the kindnesses they 'd shown her with disloyalty , so be it . Feeling guilty about impacting Robert Nelms was one thing , but the potential effect on Jerry Schultz was entirely another . The memory of her first serious professional interaction with Schultz , her new supervisor , was all too clear . She 'd sought help with a problem involving an extremely important construction project in the Philippines and was flabbergasted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer manager with no grasp of details he should have known . It was clearly on her shoulders alone , and the only elements of her work he did seem interested in were the signatures and other means of tracking who might be responsible for mistakes . Schultz was all about covering his own tail . He was a raging incompetent , she 'd told a close friend . A dangerous incompetent with delusions of adequacy . Somehow she 'd transcended Schultz during her first year and had become a guardian of the stellar reputation of Chadwick and Noble . She 'd been loath to accept the reality that the firm had grown too big to maintain its quality or even its integrity , and she 'd resisted the conclusion that the managers cared only about preserving their careers and paychecks . Finally , however , those realities became unavoidable , and in the Cascadia Island fiasco , the properly constituted managers of Chadwick and Noble had wanted to hear no criticism of their prior decisions . They had been so pathetically predictable ! Once the firm had anointed the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even God would dare to second-guess their decision . She 'd had no authority to push it any further , nor any desire to do so . After all , she was an engineer , not a seismologist . That gave her an ironclad out when the truth finally exploded into the public arena . How could anyone have expected a mere engineer to know what seismic data revealed ? Especially since she was n't even supposed to see the data . Even if she had known , who was she to say the data was right , the Chadwick and Noble cognoscenti were wrong , and Cascadia Island was doomed ? But the data was right and the island was indeed doomed . She wondered if an answer from Dr. Lam would be waiting for her on her computer . The anonymous e-mail she 'd carefully worded and sent contained a way for him to answer through an intermediate e-mail address that would prevent her having to reveal her name  --  a bit of necessary cat and mouse to focus his interest without leading to her doorstep . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'd been doing so every night without results . Eventually he would have to respond , since he was sure to realize that what she was offering would be a vindication of his own discounted , discredited theory . There would need to be a face-to-face meeting , she figured , to actually hand over the disk . But Dr. Lam could be expected to quickly trumpet the results to the geophysical world . She was sure of that . As sure as she was that if the name Diane Lacombe was n't involved in the publicity storm that would undoubtedly envelop Chadwick and Noble , Senator Ralph Lacombe could n't be drawn in either . That was very important . It was not going to be pretty . Walker may still survive , she thought . He 's worth hundreds of millions . Diane 's right hand closed around the doorknob to her apartment as her left hand approached with the key , but the door was neither latched nor closed , and for a moment she stood in confusion , wondering if she 'd left it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Maybe the manager was inside . But he 's not supposed to ... Perhaps her father ... He does n't have a key . But Don does ! The impulse to call the police and try to have Don Brevin arrested for breaking and entering was already forming in her mind , a deserved retribution for his being a boorish ex-boyfriend and for refusing to return the key when they 'd argued earlier in the day . He 'd probably come back for his meager belongings , she decided . He was n't dangerous , just a slob and an egomaniac , and she could n't fathom why she 'd ever dated him , let alone allowed him to move in for two very long , very unsatisfying months . Just another in a long line of toxic rebound boyfriends , and her tastes were getting worse . I should have changed the locks . She pushed open the door and stood stunned by the chaos that had been her apartment . Someone had ransacked her things , pulling out drawers , opening cabinets and spilling the contents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open in case anything moved inside and she needed to flee . Her largest suitcase was in the corner , pulled from the back closet and opened and left at an odd angle . The sofa had been ripped open , its stuffing strewn everywhere . The recliner had also been gored . In all the mess , she could n't tell whether anything was missing . The new high-definition TV she could n't afford still stood untouched where she 'd left it in the corner of the living room , and she felt a momentary spark of relief , as if now everything would be all right . The spark quickly died . Diane stepped over the strewn clothes , papers , and books and moved cautiously toward her bedroom door . Inside , it appeared little or nothing had been taken , but virtually everything had been dumped and , she assumed , pawed through  --  including lingerie . She felt violated and dirty , as if she , and not her apartment , had been raped . And she felt an old familiar rage escaping from its cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sideshow , and a harmless one at that . He would n't do such a thing . Would he ? A sudden realization chilled her . Brevin was n't the cause . Someone was looking for something ! The small , toxic object in her pocket was the target . Someone was on her trail and this was a very clear message . But how on earth could they already know ? No one was supposed to know of her plans , but someone must have figured she might have the records . And here I stand with the CD waiting for whoever did this to come back ! A crystalline memory of what she 'd written in her e-mail to Dr. Lam popped into her mind . Was there anyway it could have been intercepted and tracked back to her ? No ! She concluded . I did n't even send it from my computer . But what else could have tipped them off ? She thought about Jerry Schultz , her boss , the dithering neurotic she secretly called the world 's only walking invertebrate , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd labeled him . There was simply no way Schultz could have figured out what she 'd done , let alone have been brave enough to invade her apartment . Who then ? At least I had the disk with me instead of leaving it here , Diane thought . The overall mission was intact , even if her apartment was n't . She 'd been more than naive , but considering the money at stake , the loss was small . Don Brevin forgotten , Diane revised her plan on the spot . She jumped like a startled cat and began rummaging quickly through the spilled contents of her top bureau drawer until her passport emerged from underneath the wild display of her costume jewelry . There was a small gym bag in the middle of the floor which used to be in the closet and she grabbed it and began scooping a supply of basics into it before dashing to the bathroom and dumping in makeup and toiletries to accompany her toothbrush and dryer . The bag was too stuffed to be zipped fully closed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight to keep the contents inside as she dashed to the door . Distance and anonymity were the keys to success  --  and safety  --  now that someone was on her trail . She raced into the empty hallway and headed for the stairwell , focused on ways to evaporate from San Francisco . Continues ...
