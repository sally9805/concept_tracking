The fruit seller at the haymarket greets a regular : " Pedro goes tonight . " On a break at a downtown construction site , workers open their tabloid Boston Heralds from the back , where the sports are . Out in Wellesley , lawn sprinklers kick on , and investment managers for Fidelity pad sleepily up wide driveways , flipping through sections of the self-serious Boston Globe , past Nation , Business and Arts to the baseball coverage . <P> The pennant pandemic hits a handful of cities every autumn , but no place goes nuts in the spring like Boston does whenever the Red Sox get off to a good start . It 's all about maybe . Maybe this year they can win the World Series for the first time since 1918 . Throw in an early win over the profoundly reviled Yankees  --  or three early wins  --  and the city is all asweat . <P> This year more so , for there is reason to believe . The Sox have what may be the best team in the game . In a golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nomar Garciaparra , the defending American League batting champ who was hitting .387 as of Saturday . They have a new hero in center fielder Carl Everett , picked up in the off-season and now hitting .329 , with 22 homers and 63 runs batted in . They have budding stars in right fielder Trot Nixon and catcher Jason Varitek and a dominating ninth-inning pitcher in Derek Lowe , who has saved 16 games . <P> And they have Pedro . <P> In Pedro Martinez , 28 , the Red Sox have  --  with due respect to Arizona 's Randy Johnson  --  the best pitcher in baseball . After winning 23 games and losing only four in 1999 , then performing postseason heroics against Cleveland and New York , Martinez has won nine games this year and lost two  --  with an average of 12 strikeouts for every nine innings he pitches . What 's most impressive about Martinez is his earned-run average : the number of runs that opposing teams score against him , without help from errors , for every nine innings that he pitches . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 a game is considered good , Pedro 's ERA is an astonishing 0.99 . The modern-day full-season record is Bob Gibson 's 1.12 , posted in 1968 and considered untouchable  --  until now . <P> The Red Sox 's Bret Saberhagen , who has been around for 17 seasons , a couple of them as the finest pitcher of his day , says flatly , " That little man 's the best I 've ever seen . In my era , you 've got Roger Clemens , Randy Johnson , Greg Maddux  --  but as far as I 'm concerned , Pedro 's the best . " <P> At 5 ft. 11 in. and 170 lbs. , Martinez is indeed , by the standards of major league pitchers , a little man . He is the smallest ever to strike out more than 300 batters in a season , a milestone he reached in 1997 and again last year . How does he do it ? The Boston faithful say he 's a miracle . Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette calls Martinez " a gift from God . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in miracles say the answer can be found in Martinez 's extraordinary fingers  --  long and slender like those of a pianist . They allow him to grip the ball longer and spin it fiercely , making it sing and dance . From the same arm motion , Pedro can deliver four very different pitches . He has a straight fast ball that approaches 100 m.p.h. , a cut fast ball that moves in on left-handed hitters , a curve that suddenly dives for the plate and the game 's best change-up , which often has a red-faced hitter completing his swing before the ball arrives .
