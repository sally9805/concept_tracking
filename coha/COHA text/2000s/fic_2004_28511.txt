Chapter One Magic exists . Who can doubt it , when there are rainbows and wildflowers , the music of the wind and the silence of the stars ? Anyone who has loved has been touched by magic . It is such a simple and such an extraordinary part of the lives we live . There are those who have been given more , who have been chosen to carry on a legacy handed down through endless ages . Their forebears were Merlin the enchanter , Ninian the sorceress , the faerie princess Rhiannon , the Wegewarte of Germany and the jinns of Arabia . Through their blood ran the power of Finn of the Celts , the ambitious Morgan le Fay , and others whose names were whispered only in shadows and in secret . When the world was young and magic as common as a raindrop , faeries danced in the deep forests , and - sometimes for mischief , sometimes for love - mixed with mortals . And they do still . Her bloodline was old . Her power was ancient . Even as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such gifts were not without price . The loving parents who treasured her could not lower the cost , or pay it themselves , but could only love , instruct and watch the young girl grow to womanhood . They could only stand and hope as she experienced the pains and the joys of that most fascinating of journeys . And , because she felt more than others , because her gift demanded that she feel more , she learned to court peace . As a woman , she preferred a quiet life , and was often alone without the pain of loneliness . As a witch , she accepted her gift , and never forgot the responsibility it entailed . Perhaps she yearned , as mortals and others have yearned since the beginning , for a true and abiding love . For she knew better than most that there was no power , no enchantment , no sorcery , greater than the gift of an open and accepting heart . When she saw the little girl peek through the fairy roses , Anastasia had no idea the child would change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she often did when she gardened , enjoying the scent and the feel of earth . The warm September sun was golden , and the gentle whoosh of the sea on the rocks below her sloping yard was a lovely background to the buzzing of bees and the piping of birdsong . Her long gray cat was stretched out beside her , his tail twitching in time with some feline dream . A butterfly landed soundlessly on her hand , and she stroked the edge of its pale blue wings with a fingertip . As it fluttered off , she heard the rustling . Glancing over , she saw a small face peeping through the hedge of fairy roses . Ana 's smile came quickly , naturally . The face was charming , with its little pointed chin and its pert nose , its big blue eyes mirroring the color of the sky . A pixie cap of glossy brown hair completed the picture . The girl smiled back , those summer-sky eyes full of curiosity and mischief . " Hello , " Ana said , as if she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The girl 's voice was bright , and a little breathless . " Can you catch butterflies ? I never got to pet one like that before . " " I suppose . But it seems rude to try unless one invites you . " She brushed the hair from her brow with her forearm and sat back on her heels . Ana had noticed a moving van unloading the day before , and she concluded she was meeting one of her new neighbors . " Have you moved into the house next door ? " " Uh-huh . We 're going to live here now . I like it , ' cause I get to look right out my bedroom window and see the water . I saw a seal , too . In Indiana you only see them in the zoo . Can I come over ? " " Of course you can . " Ana set her garden spade aside as the girl stepped through the rosebushes . In her arms was a wriggling puppy . " And who do we have here ? " " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the puppy 's head . " She 's a golden retriever . I got to pick her out myself right before we left Indiana . She got to fly in the plane with us , and we were hardly scared at all . I have to take good care of her and give her food and water and brush her and everything , ' cause she 's my responsibility . " " She 's very beautiful , " Ana said soberly . And very heavy , she imagined , for a little girl of five or six . She held out her arms . " May I ? " " Do you like dogs ? " The little girl kept chattering as she passed Daisy over . " I do . I like dogs and cats and everything . Even the hamsters Billy Walker has . Someday I 'm going to have a horse , too . We 'll have to see about that . That 's what my daddy says . We 'll have to see about that . " Utterly charmed , Ana stroked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child was as sweet as sunshine . " I 'm very fond of dogs and cats and everything , " Ana told her . " My cousin has horses . Two big ones and a brand-new baby . " " Really ? " The child squatted down and began to pet the sleeping cat . " Can I see them ? " " He does n't live far , so perhaps one day . We 'll have to ask your parents . " " My mommy went to heaven . She 's an angel now . " Ana 's heart broke a little . Reaching out , she touched the shiny hair and opened herself . There was no pain here , and that was a relief . The memories were good ones . At the touch , the child looked up and smiled . " I 'm Jessica , " she said . " But you can call me Jessie . " " I 'm Anastasia . " Because it was too much to resist , Ana bent down and kissed the pert nose . " But you can call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
