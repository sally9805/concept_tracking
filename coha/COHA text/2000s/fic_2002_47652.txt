for Graeme Hughes , 1961-1998 IT WAS the special water . At first , we believed it was only the two of us that had made this discovery-by the time we realized we were wrong , it was too late : the commitment made . My partner , Les , found the clay pit by studying an old ordnance map . At the time we were fishing some little ponds , enjoying ourselves and catching plenty of good carp . But of course that was not enough . And we , which in truth meant I , needed to reach further . <p> The place was so well hidden there was no chance of any distant view or chance finding . It was not until you reached the end of a long , convoluted track between two old hedgerows that you came upon the lake . Then in a silver explosion it engulfed you . A vast complex of clear water , reed islands , and bays : a natural place with its own random shape-no gravel or clay pit , not a disguised scar for once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just sat in the car , not even wanting to get out-full of so much expectation-at that moment free from everything we had brought with us or left behind . <p> We walked all the banks trying to become oriented and make a decision on where we would start to fish when the season opened in a couple months ' time . The water 's clarity and richness were unbelievable . It teemed with life : every square inch pulsing in its own microcosm of dramas , and all of it food and growth for the carp . I tried to explain to my wife why we were so excited : " It is like a soup , " I said . " A primeval soup , rich and unspoilt . The perfect natural balance to produce what we desire . " <p> We decided to pre-bait a spot in front of the largest island . To get the bait concentrated in a small area , we were going to row out in a rubber dinghy and tip out buckets of the tiny seeds three times a week . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths and making charts . In places it went from being very shallow , with tendrils of weed stretching all the way to the surface , to a sudden hole of deep blackness . The temperature leapt too , from warm to ice-cold , and the waters swirled in powerful and unpredictable currents . It had all the glamor and mystery that was needed . A dream location , we said , and one to be kept secret from the rest of the world . A friend of my wife had a husband who fished . " Do n't you tell anyone where I am going to be fishing , " I warned her again . <p> It was about three weeks after we started our baiting campaign that we met the first of the others . We were chattering away , full of childish excitement . It was a special thing to have a friend you could share so many dreams with , and we both felt it strongly that morning . We had just hauled the dinghy onto the bank when a man stepped out from the reeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing a camouflage jacket and trousers . He looked at us and then quickly down into the buckets and dinghy-trying , I knew , to see what bait we were using . Luckily , I always washed out the containers over the spot and made sure nothing was ever dropped in the boat . <p> " Baiting the ' island swim , ' " he said , giving it a name as if to claim proprietorial rights . <p> Les nodded . I tried to think back to our earlier conversation and felt embarrassed and vulnerable . <p> " We thought about it , " he said , " but decided to make a start in the bay . " He gestured toward one of the shallow areas . <p> " Have you fished here before ? " I heard Les ask him . I moved away , not wanting to hear anything he might say . A short way off another person came into view and was staring across the lake with a pair of binoculars . <p> " This water , " he said as I reached him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was a tall , powerful-looking man with a very red and weatherbeaten face . He had a strong cockney accent and was smiling , or smirking , at me . " It is what we " - and I knew he was not talking about me or anyone else present- " call a ' hard water . ' I can already imagine who will still be here by the end of the season , those few that will be able to endure and keep believing-and all the rest . " He said this and marched off before I could let him know that I would be there long after he 'd cracked . <p> On the drive back Les told me what the other man had said . There were four of them fishing together . They were taking turns to do the pre-baiting . Three were locals , like us . The other man , the one I had met , was , according to Less information , a genius . One of the great anglers , with a reputation throughout Europe for catching the biggest fish . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . Then he wanted to know what the great angler had said to me . " He just wished us well , " I said . " And I did the same back to him . " <p> By the time the season got underway we had met about twelve other anglers . All fishing different areas and trying to keep out of each other 's way . We had also seen some of the fish : large specimen carp , mirrors , and commons basking and rolling around where we were baiting . And one morning , at dawn , just before we had to return home and get ready for work , when a mist was hovering in a band a couple feet above the dead-calm surface of the lake , the monster appeared . It rolled out of the water about ten feet away as we paddled along in the little dinghy . We were both looking at the exact spot as it came out as if in slow motion . On and on it came , a white leather-carp . It was massive . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wow , " Les said . " That fish was well over forty pounds . " He was right . But it was something else that had caught my eye-the flash of glass above the band of mist as someone lowered his binoculars and slipped away . <p> In my opinion the only good thing about the close season was the fact that it meant there was an opening day : June sixteenth . We were there in the early hours of the fifteenth to make certain no one got into our places . I noticed that the four men fishing the bay were already in position and waiting . There was a funny thing about the start of the season : Though it was dark by ten o'clock and nobody was likely to make a deal out of you stealing a couple of hours , you never heard anyone start until the last stroke of midnight had sounded . On this lake you could actually hear the nearby village church clock sounding out the hours . We tried to remain calm and detached as the tension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaak Walton advised anglers : It is just the beginning . Then as the twelfth chime died across the water , I heard the tiny splashes of leads and baited hooks hitting the water , and the beeping of electronic bite alarms being adjusted and armed . <p> I had my first run and fish after about thirty minutes , Les a little while after that . Suddenly all over the lake you could hear fish being caught . " Hard water ! " I said out loud . " Heartbreaker ! " <p> But he was right . All any of us caught in those first few weeks were nuisance fish : little carp or other species that disturbed the water and ate all the bait . Then even they slowed down , and the going got tough . One night the guy with the crewcut , whose name was Stephen , met Les in a pub . He told him they were quitting the water and had found a small lake they were going to rent as a syndicate . He invited Les in on it , and Les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a truism that you fish best alone and without distractions . <p> Ten weeks after the start of the season we had the lake to ourselves : the so-called genius and myself . He was there when I arrived , and there when I left . In fact , I was not sure that he ever moved off the place . He never came over for a chat and never waved in greeting , or returned one the couple of times I tried . Sometimes during the night I heard him fighting and then landing a fish ; sometimes he must have heard me  --  though rarely , and then not at all . At least , I told myself , if I was no longer catching the small stuff , it might mean that the better fish were starting to move : that they were coming into the baited area , testing and probing . Each second could be the one when my bait was finally accepted and sucked into a trusting mouth-maybe even the mouth of the giant white fish-and the real struggle could begin . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant carp whilst you were thinking about it , that in some unexplainable way they were able to detect your thoughts and know they were being hunted . Time after time anglers recalled getting the bite that led to a great fish at the very moment when they were brewing tea , answering the call of nature , falling asleep , anything but concentrating on fishing-far too many times to be put down to coincidence . I knew I needed a way to clear my mind of the hunt , but nothing that existed above the water seemed to have any challenge or mystery left : I could not even manage it any longer when I was away from the place . <p> Lying in bed at night I began to dread that someone else was at the moment in my swim , about to catch my fish . I pictured the other men  --  always they appeared larger and more dynamic than myself-hooked into some slow-moving specimen that kited and swirled just out of sight . Then one day as I sat down to breakfast with my wife and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned into a clear liquid full of life and moving . I was about to set off on a five-day session on the lake . <p> " I may give up on that water , " I said to my wife , Susan . " I may not even bother going today . " <p> " You must , " she said , and then , seeing my surprise at her reply : " I mean you have put in so much time and effort-it would be a shame to give up too easily , like Les did . Like all those other weak men you spent so much time telling me about . " <p> On my way to the lake I reached one of the large roundabouts and made up my mind to go back home . I would spend the time doing some of the jobs that had mounted up-I would take the children to the zoo  --  Susan and I could go out for a couple of evenings : The car went round and round three or four times before I ended up back en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up my tackle the sun was high and the water still and heavy , as if it had turned to mercury . Nothing was going to feed or bother moving until late evening , apart from the shoals of fry that fanned just below the surface tension . I decided it was time to get to know the other angler-I could see him sprawling on his bed chair . He appeared , as I got close , more drained and worn than the first time I 'd seen him , but I noticed that his hand moved quickly and closed the lid of a bait container as he heard my approach . <p> " Some hot day , " I said , standing in the mess that was his camp . Though amongst the rubbish his fishing tackle was immaculate and the best money could buy . <p> " There will be a storm tonight , " he said , " then we 'll get some action . Maybe even one of the biggies will show . " <p> One of the lines hanging limply from the three-rod setup he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was too delicate a movement for even the electronic alarm to register , but by the time I saw it he had struck . The rod bent , and the line began to sing with the strain of a heavy fish . I watched as he took control of the fish and after a few minutes began to pump it in . " You can net this one for me , " he said . I picked up the huge landing net . A lot of fish are lost at the netting stage by someone inexperienced making a mess of it . I felt he was testing me and felt nervous and pleased at the chance . I held the net still , knowing it was up to him to draw it in and not for me to stab or make any movement that might panic it into a fresh fight . I lifted it slowly as it filled the net , and it was ours . It was a mirror-carp of over twenty pounds and , to me , a very good fish . <p> " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , unhooking it and slipping it back into the water without weighing it or mentioning a photograph . Every fish that was judged to be a specimen had to be weighed , photographed , and if possible witnessed . Otherwise it did not count , would not be believed , had not really to the rest of the angling world ever been caught . To him this fish did not matter . It was bigger than anything I 'd caught from this place , close to being bigger than anything I had caught anywhere , and he 'd just tossed it back . I tried to act nonchalant and keep what I hoped might be the start of a friendship going . <p> " You will never catch that fish , " he said , and for a moment I thought he meant the one he had just released . Then I realized what he meant . <p> " It is why I am here , " I said . <p> " It is why we all came here , " he said . " But I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bait . It probably lives on microorganisms and is beyond trusting anything larger . I have not even seen it roll since we have been fishing . It knows us now . " <p> I could see that he was waiting to put a bait on the rod that had landed the fish and that he was not going to do it so long as I stood watching . <p> " Oh well , " I said , " good luck . " <p> He looked at me as if I had said the most terrible or beautiful thing possible . In his pale blue eyes , peering out of his sunburnt face , there was a moment of pain and then fury before he turned back to the water . <p> As I headed back to my swim , I thought about a famous angler who had ended up in a monastery after driving himself to a nervous breakdown in pursuit of some giant fish from a small secret lake that itself was now a legend . There had also been a book that had in one chapter listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives to catch bigger and bigger fish : in the pursuit of monsters . How , it had asked , could something that was meant to be a relaxing hobby and an escape from the pressures of the world become the opposite ? <p> " How can a passion turn into obsession ? " I asked myself and marched back to phone Susan . I could not find the cellphone . I kept it safely in a pocket in my rucksack and knew that it could not have fallen out . Along with everything else important , I would have marked it off on my checklist before leaving home . I tried to recall doing so , but could no longer find anything tangible that had occurred away from this liquid sphere . I hurried off to the village to find a phone box and tell Susan that I would definitely not be staying the full five days and that we were going to do something together as soon as I got home . The phone rang and rang , and I did not want to cut off , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out in the exact right spot-that little square that exists more in a feeling than on any printable chart . It had become very dark and cool . It was too late now to break down my tackle and leave , though all the excitement and expectation had gone . I felt lonely and restless . The night stretched ahead-cold and pointless . I had to phone Susan and explain-share these new feelings with her . It became more important than anything else , and I began to inch my way around the bank toward the sleeping village . A flashlight was out of the question as I did not want to be seen by him . <p> The first flash of lightning lit up the lake as I was on the opposite side of the bay . It carried on continually after that , turning the blackness into electric-blue moments of exposure . The first drops of cold , heavy rain were falling as I reached the road ; by the time I dialed the number the storm had passed . In the distance a spark and a rumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The number was engaged . I checked my watch and tried again . " Who could be on the phone this time of night ? " I asked out loud . <p> I waited , determined to get through , and something I had failed to do found a way through everything else : I had left the baits in the water and the rods unattended . It was unforgivable , the worst and sloppiest thing an angler could do on any water-especially so on one with such specimens . A fish could pick up a bait , and if it did not manage to chew through the line with its throat teeth , become deep-hooked and entangled ; it would end up towing a rod in and staying attached to it . I had to get back but still wanted to call . One more try , and this time the phone rang without answer . Everything began to swirl like eddies in my mind as I stood trying to focus . <p> The walk back to the lake helped me settle down . I had decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would drive home to find out what was going on and return early in the morning to collect it . If by chance it got stolen then that would be fate . <p> The black shape standing and moving slowly in my swim stopped me in shock-then I knew . <p> " I heard your bite alarm screaming nonstop across the lake , " he said . " I 'd spotted you skulking off during the storm . What the hell are you playing at ? " <p> I watched the curve of the rod swaying and juddering above our heads as he tried to control the fight . <p> " One of my children is ill , " I lied . " I promised to ring home . The storm . They are all scared of thunder . " <p> " You have no right to have done this . To come to such a special place is a privilege : To come without any love of nature or respect for your quarry is a sin . I do n't understand what drives someone like you , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is a big fish , and something is wrong . " <p> His voice had more sadness in it than contempt , and he would not look round at me . I could not speak or move and just stood there watching . The fight went on and on . Each time it looked as if the fish was coming in it ran again and the whole long haul began over . In the end the fight was contained to an area closer in . The water heaved and boiled and became a mass of bubbles , though the fish still did not break the surface . Finally he laid his own landing net into the water and eased the fish into it . <p> The huge white carp lay in the net 's folds on the bank . A sweet smell of crushed mint and wild garlic came from the vegetation underneath . The flashlight showed the thick fishing line leading down into the gaping mouth . He was kneeling by its side trying to see how deep it went and where the fish had been hooked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the corners of its mouth , slowly and then faster , covering the massive white flanks and the carp fisher 's trembling hands . <p> Author Affiliation
