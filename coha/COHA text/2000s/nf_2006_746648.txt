Introduction <p> Although several studies provide insights regarding the impact of the elementary school principal upon the success of the school reading program and student reading achievement scores , there are few , if any , studies that link characteristics of principals with actual standardized test scores . In this study , field notes and observations , along with teacher and principal interviews , are synthesized for four elementary principals . After these data are triangulated , four principal composites emerge and are subsequently analyzed within the standards established by the National Association of Elementary School Principals . These four principal composites are then linked with three years of second graders ' reading test scores . Three concepts that enable an elementary school principal to influence the school reading program and student test scores are : ( 1 ) the vision of the principal ; ( 2 ) the educational background of the principal ; and ( 3 ) the principal 's role as an instructional leader . <p> The role of the principal is dynamic and changing . In fact , changes in the work environment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school principals . As educational communities demand more data-driven accountability measures , the role of the principal as one who can both articulate and implement the vision of an effective instructional environment for all students and teachers becomes an important factor in student success ( Marsh , 1997 ) . <p> Not only must school principals become knowledgeable instructional leaders , but they should also exhibit the characteristics of strong leadership . Such factors include cultivating a community of learners , giving voice to all stakeholders , envisioning key values , and demonstrating personal demeanors to enable all of these somewhat incongruous elements to ' come together ' to form an outstanding school ( Nadeau &; Leighton , 1996 ) . <p> The National Association of Elementary School Principals ( NAESP ) published <p> NAESP Standards for What Principals Should Know and Be Able to Do in 2001 . Included in the standards are indicators of what the NAESP believes makes a quality school , and there are six standards relative to what a principal must know and be able to do if he/she is to provide leadership that enables his/her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this research project was to : ( 1 ) develop composites of four principals ' influences upon their schools ' reading programs ; ( 2 ) to discuss those composites within the context of the National Association of Elementary School Principals ' 2001 standards ; ( 3 ) to link the principal composites to standardized reading test scores ; and ( 4 ) to begin to explore the development of a model of principal influence upon student reading achievement . Review of the literature <p> The idea that the principal yields immense influence within an elementary school is well substantiated ( Blas and Blas , 1999 ; Bogler , 2001 ; Checkley , 2000 ; Marcher and Hyle , 1996 ; Sergiovanni , 1996 ) . Blase and Blase ( 1999 ) present findings that suggest that principals who are viewed as effective instructional leaders within their schools use a broad-based approach for teachers ' growth and reflection . The principals themselves " embrace the challenges of growing and changing " ( p. 370 ) , conceive of teachers not as technicians but as intellectuals , and , above all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a study by Bogler ( 2001 ) , teachers reported higher job satisfaction when they were given opportunities for self-development and participation in the decision-making procedures for the school . It was from these aspects that teachers experienced a higher sense of self-esteem and empowerment , which was associated with an increased sense of job satisfaction . In this study , the principal 's leadership style was associated with the teachers ' satisfaction . Marcher and Hyle ( 1996 ) discovered that effective elementary instructional leaders engaged in various strategies designed to balance power inequities in their school community . They exemplified the use of collaborative power based on trust , respect , and collegiality . <p> Principals who demonstrate effective instructional leadership and help at-risk students are able to meet students ' and teachers ' basic/instructional , academic/professional , and affective needs . In schools where at-risk students are achieving success , principals : ( 1 ) support teachers ' instructional methods ; ( 2 ) allocate resources and materials ; ( 3 ) make frequent visits to classrooms for instructional purposes ; ( 4 ) solicit and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) use data to focus attention on improving the curriculum or instructional approach ( Mendez-Morse , 1991 ) . Heck ( 1999 ) describes how achievement outcomes can be predicted based on teachers ' and principals ' perceptions of instructional leadership . <p> Griffith ( 1999 ) posits the idea that there are school structural characteristics and student population characteristics that affect the effectiveness of principals . Variables like a change in the principalship , a high percentage of students new to the district , and a high percentage of minority students impacted teachers ' perceived sense of lack of order , discipline , and parental participation . His findings also suggest that the effective school principal uses a combination of leadership styles to ameliorate these variables . <p> The National Association for Elementary School Principals ( October , 2001 ) delineated six standards for " what principals should know and be able to do " ( p. 5 ) . These six standards include : ( 1 ) Leading schools in a way that puts student and adult learning at the center ; ( 2 ) Promoting the academic success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigorous content and instruction ; ( 4 ) Creating a climate of continuous learning for adults ; ( 5 ) Using multiple sources of data as a diagnostic tool ; and ( 6 ) Actively engaging the community . Despite a growing scholarly consensus that depicts the importance of the principal 's leadership style upon school climate , teacher morale , and overall school productiveness , little research exists that describes and connects influences of the principal 's leadership , NAESP standards , and student reading test scores . Method <p> This study evolved out of a larger study designed to examine the reading strategies of second graders in four urban schools using four different reading programs ( Altwerger , B. , Laster , B , Wilson , G. P. , Ayra , P. , Martens , P. , Renman , N. , Mackey , B. , Wiltz , N. , Pitcher , S. , Jin , L. &; Lang , D. , 2002 ) . The reading programs were designated Direct Instruction , Guided Reading , Open Court , and Balanced Literacy with Open Court Embedded ( see Appendix A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define the reading program in each school ( Altwerger et al , 2002 ) . <p> Ethnographic data were collected in three second grade classrooms at each of the four schools during the language arts instructional time . Three second grade classroom teachers from each of these twelve classrooms were interviewed with a seven question interview , plus an open-ended ' grand tour ' ( Spradley , 1979 ) question about the values of their school 's reading program and their implementation of the language arts curriculum . <p> As the ethnographers observed and collected data in the schools , the importance of the role of the principal began to emerge as significant to the way the reading programs were conceived and carried out in the school . A three-question interview guide ( see Appendix B ) was developed for the principal interview . The principals were encouraged to respond in a conversational manner , addressing any topics that they felt were important to their school reading programs . The four principal interviews , along with the teacher interviews , were audio-taped and transcribed . <p> Triangulation of the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal interviews , teacher interviews , and classroom observations ( field notes ) . The constant comparison approach was used to allow emerging themes to develop ( Lincoln &; Cuba , 1985 ; Bogdan &; Bilden , 2001 ) . Member checking occurred during a follow-up visit during the 2002 - 2003 school year . Each principal reviewed the data analysis , thus increasing the rigor of the findings . <p> The triangulation of ethnographic data , the further analysis of that triangulated data within five NAESP 's standards ( see Appendix C for explanations ) for principals , and the inclusion of student reading test scores for the year prior to , the year of , and the year after data collection formed a composite profile of each elementary principal . The NAESP 's sixth standard , " Actively engaging the community , " was not analyzed because researchers were not able to get consistent information about the role of the principal regarding this standard in each of the schools . Additionally , the Comprehensive-Tests of Basic Skills ( CTBS ) scores published on the " Report Card 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantitative data on second grade students ' reading progress in the schools . These reading achievement scores ( Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ) were collected for three years ( 1999-2002 ) to explore how and in which ways a principal profile can be associated with student reading achievement as measured by standardized assessments . Results Composite Profiles of Four Elementary Principals : Direct Instruction ( DI ) Principal Background Information <p> The principal of the Direct Instruction School had been a speech pathologist before going into administration . At the time of the study , she had served as the principal of the school for nine years . The school is in the middle of a large urban city and the population is very multicultural ( 45% African American , 12% Asian , 2% Hispanic , and 41% White ) . During the year of the study , the free and reduced lunch percentage was over 93 . The principal shared that a large percentage of children in her school do not have English as their first language . NAESP #1 : Leading schools in a way that puts student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal chose Direct Instruction for her school because she held a strong belief that the program would address the needs of her students with language deficits and generational poverty . She felt Direct Instruction had " guaranteed results . " After observing the program on an Indian Reservation , she felt it " teaches children to read despite low language skill and poverty . " NAESP #2 : Promoting the academic success of all students . <p> The DI principal chose the program and strongly articulated its value . In order to meet the needs of the children in her school , she added after school tutoring and enrichment programs to supplement the Direct Instruction program . All children in the school participated in this extended day program . She stated she " had a school filled with children with language and vocabulary deficits . I needed guaranteed results . We tried every approach , then found what was appropriate for these kids . " NAESP #3 : Creating and demanding rigorous content and instruction . <p> The DI principal had her teachers trained in Dl methods and had a DI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant frequently observed during the language arts block . She also recognized the need to supplement DI with more writing and comprehension instruction . She provided an extended day program for all the children in order to add this content to the school day . NAESP #4 : Creating a climate of continuous learning for adults . <p> The DI principal supported training in DI for all of her teachers . She visited a school herself before putting in the program . She sent the teachers to see schools outside the state , had a DI trainer to work on site with her teachers , and had weekly phone conversations with a DI administrator in Oregon . NAESP #5 : Using multiple sources of data as a diagnostic tool . <p> The DI principal was extremely data driven . She referred to profiles , percentages , and test scores from a variety of sources during our conversations with her . She shared she uses " data from the tests to tell whether the program is working and what parts are n't . " She also used demographic and community data in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could make decisions on all kinds of programs that could provide support the community needs . CTBS ( Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ) Scores <p> The year before the study occurred , the Median National Percentile Rank for second grade was 30 ; the year of the study it was 39 ; the year after the study it was 35 . Guided Reading ( GR ) Principal Background Information <p> The principal of the Guided Reading School was an elementary and middle school teacher . She delivered mathematics in-service training for the school system before becoming a principal . She also has a Masters degree in clinical psychology . Her school is located on the edge of the city in a county school district . The population of her school is 83% African American , 1% American Indian , 3% Asian , 2% Hispanic , and 11% White . During the year of the study , the school 's free and reduced lunch percentage was over 53 . She had been principal of the school for five years at the time of the study . NAESP #1 : Leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the center . <p> The GR principal blended many different philosophies in providing the leadership for her school . She employed a reading specialist to come to her school and put the reading program in place . She depended on the judgment of the reading specialist and teachers to make program decisions . She shared , " Children should be taught to know and do . so I 'm looking for independence , application , engagement , a lot of higher level thinking where they ( the children ) have to synthesize a lot of different concepts and skills in order to solve a problem as they explore through an activity or task . " NAESP #2 : Promoting the academic success of all students . <p> The GR principal delegated the implementation of the vision ( i.e. , developing the school reading culture and organizing the school environment to support literacy ) to her reading specialist . She supported the effort by buying the necessary materials ( leveled texts , professional books , posters ) . She shared , " Our reading specialist met with the teams of teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom that would have the guided reading instruction along with literacy centers and so forth . " NAESP #3 : Creating and demanding rigorous content and instruction . <p> The GR principal hired teachers according to their view of teaching the whole child and not necessarily for their background in literacy . She depended on the reading specialist to oversee the literacy professional development in her building with the help of other teachers who had participated in summer literacy groups . NAESP #4 : Creating a climate of continuous learning for adults . <p> The GR principal visited a school with the model and then invited a reading specialist to come to the school the next year to create the same kind of program . The reading specialist facilitated professional development in the building . The principal provided time for the grade level teams to meet . The teachers became very involved in developing the program and later presented at professional conferences NAESP #5 : Using multiple sources of data as a diagnostic tool . <p> The GR principal was also very data driven . She spoke at length about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She asked teachers to keep data on children 's reading levels on a quarterly basis for her review . CTBS Scores <p> The second grade Median National Percentile Rank the year before the study in reading was 51 ( the first year that the reading specialist initiated the program ) . The year of the study the second grade score was 46 , and the year after the study it was also 46 . Open Court ( OC ) Principal Background Information <p> The principal of the Open Court school was an administrator of the school for three years at the time of the study . She came to the school as an assistant principal and became the principal one and a half years later . Her school , which is in an urban city , had 88% free and reduced lunch the year of the study with 97% of the student population being African American , 1% Asian , 1% Hispanic , and 1% White . NAESP #1 : Leading schools in a way that puts student and adult learning at the center . <p> The OC principal did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city school system 's leadership in selecting the program for the kindergarten through second grades in the system . She relied on the master teacher 's leadership for making program decisions and often turned to her for knowledge confirmation throughout our interview with her . NAESP #2 : Promoting the academic success of all students . <p> The OC principal shared that the system chose the reading program and the principal empowered the master teacher to articulate the vision of it . All of the reading materials were provided by the system . Her vision of Open Court was " Open Court came in like a light . More like lightning . ' Cause the kids just soaked it up . They do n't feel that there is a word that they ca n't say . And that 's a miracle in itself . They 're never intimidated by a word . " NAESP #3 : Creating and demanding rigorous content and instruction . <p> The OC principal shared that she had less training in Open Court than her teachers so she relied on them to teach her . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implementation of the program . The year before the study the principal lost some of her teachers to another school so she had three new second grade teachers , one of which did not have Open Court training . During our interview , she could not remember the name of some of the Open Court materials that were in the school and she depended on the master teacher to answer many of the interviewers ' questions . NAESP #4 : Creating a climate of continuous learning for adults . <p> At the OC school , the teachers and master teachers attended summer training for three to four weeks during the summer . The principal attended only a four-day training . The system provided a consultant to visit the school to give support to the teachers and provided opportunities to go visit other schools in the system using OC . NAESP #5 : Using multiple sources of data as a diagnostic tool . <p> The OC principal was slightly data driven . She shared with our interviewers that first grade CTBS scores-were higher than any other grade because " the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems milestone tests , sharing that 97% of her children passed the first milestone test ( these were designed by the textbook company ) . This high passing percentage " would not have happened without this program " . CTBS Scores <p> The second grade Median National Percentile Rank the year before the study was 30 . During the year of the study the score was 50 , and the year after the study it dropped to 35 . Balanced Literacy with Open Court Embedded ( BLOCE ) Principal Background Information <p> The principal of this school had been an intermediate teacher . He had a Masters degree in reading and had completed doctoral studies in educational leadership but did not complete the dissertation . He had been the principal of the school for ten years , which included supervising a complete renovation of the school a few years before the study . His school which is localed in the middle of a large urban city had a 90.1% of students on free and reduced lunch with 98% African American children , 1% Asian , and 1% White NAESP #1 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning at the center . <p> The BLOCE principal shared at the interview that " As instructional leaders , we have to take the lead . " His school during this school year was part of an initiative to add balanced literacy components to the Open Court program in his school . He shared that this was the first year he got involved instead of delegating and observing . The balanced literacy initiative focused the professional development on the school administrators . The administrators then brought the components of the initiative to their school and worked as a team to share the professional development with the teachers in their school . He shared that for the first time in the ten years he was principal of the school , he actively " became part of the literacy program . " NAESP #2 : Promoting the academic success of all students . <p> The BLOCE principal led the vision of changing the reading program in his school . He also added cultural programs to enrich the experience of the students . The Koalaty Kids Program , which he adopted school-wide , emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He spoke to us about how he applied this to himself and his teachers . He put technology throughout the school through grant funding . During the year of this study , he bought professional books , classroom libraries , and literacy center materials for all of the teachers in the school . He shared that before the year of the study , " We were floating along thinking we were okay . It was n't until last year that we took a real look at being a balanced literacy school and what we saw just clicked . Before last year 1 did a lot of delegation . I sat down and said I would do it and it made a difference . " NAESP #3 : Creating and demanding rigorous content and instruction . <p> The BLOCE principal personally supervised the training of his teachers . Either he or one of administrative staff conducted the balanced literacy professional development of the teachers . When he brought in an outside consultant for special training in literacy centers , he provided materials and time during the school day so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ethnographer from our study that did the field notes at his school saw him in the classrooms during the language arts block every day she was there . He shared that he spent 90 minutes a day during the language arts block in the classroom and for the first time in many years rolled up his sleeves and got involved in instruction . He also bought professional books and classroom libraries for all of his teachers . NAESP #4 : Creating a climate of continuous learning for adults . <p> The BLOCE principal attended monthly administrators ' meetings centered around balanced literacy . He brought the professional development back to the school . He also provided substitutes so teachers could attend professional development opportunities and have grade level meetings . He emphasized that they had " to tear those walls down and open up , so what we do is have a team . " Grade level meetings were held in different classrooms so teachers could experience how another teacher created a literacy environment . NAESP #5 : Using multiple sources of data as a diagnostic tool . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , he shared test scores and percentages easily without referring to printouts . He discussed how he adopted the Koalaty Kids program and sought grants to provide for deficits that data led him to consider . He also shared how he monitored city-wide milestone assessments and involved his teachers in evaluating this source to make changes in instruction . CTBS Scores <p> In the year before the study , when he was not as involved with personally overseeing the reading program Median National Percentile Rank was 35 . The second grade percentile rank the year of the study in reading was 55 . In the year after the study he was able to sustain the gain with a different group of children with a percentile score of again 55 . Discussion of an exploratory model <p> After analyzing the triangulated principal data within the contexts of both NAESP Standards and CTBS reading scores , three significant concepts emerged : <p> ( 1 ) who established and shared the VISION of the reading program ; <p> ( 2 ) the educational BACKGROUND of the principal which influenced his/her role as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional leader put the reading program in place , i.e. the INSTRUCTIONAL ROLE of the principal . <p> Our exploratory model of principal influence upon student reading achievement is based on the interrelationship of these three concepts . The comparisons and differences among the four principals in regard to these three concepts are discussed below and summarized in Figure 1 . VISIONS of Principals : <p> DI principal chose the program for her school and was actively involved with the Direct Instruction personnel to monitor the program . She was not solely responsible for implementing the program , and this reliance upon DI consultants may have influenced the role of the principal as a visionary . <p> Both GR and OC principals delegated this leadership to someone else on their staffs and did not seem to understand the philosophy of the programs . The GR principal followed the suggestions of the reading specialist and allowed teachers to make instructional decisions about the program . The OC principal delegated the vision of the reading program to her master teacher and to OC consultants who visited the school . Our researchers in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned with the programs that the principals professed to have in the building . <p> BLOCE principal shared with us how he came to lead the change in his school that we saw that year . He shared that for the first time he " pushed up his sleeves " and personally got involved in professional development and monitoring the program . The second grade CTBS scores in his school rose 20 points during the year when he took over the literacy leadership in his building . BACKGROUNDS of the Principals : <p> Two of the principals ( DI and BLOCE ) had expertise in fields related to reading , and their decisions were grounded in this knowledge . Two principals ( GR and OC ) depended on the expertise of others to choose the reading program for their schools . <p> The DI principal relied on her background as a speech pathologist to choose the reading program in her school . Her school community included children with limited language background and children from homes where English was not the first language . Having visited a school on an Indian Reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program was the one she wanted in her school . Her decision was based on those components of the program that she knew were important to foster language acquisition and not necessarily reading achievement . <p> The GR principal held a Master 's degree in clinical psychology . She had also been responsible for providing math programs for her district . The school 's reading specialist , not the GR principal , suggested the Guided Reading Program . The GR principal 's knowledge of the program was one visit to a school that used Guided Reading . The GR Principal 's lack of educational background to understand the reading program might have contributed to the many inconsistencies observed by our researchers about her expectations for the program and how she supervised her teachers . At the GR school , our ethnographer did not observe all of the components of the model that the school professed to have which was based on the work of Fountas and Pinnell as shared in their book , Guided Reading : Good First Teaching for All Children ( 1996 ) . Instead of the flexible grouping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this school were grouped in homogenous groups in accordance with the principal 's belief that " ability groups " were best so children could be taught at their instructional level . The principal was also influenced by the pressures and practices of the state and local school district , which was based on a " sequence of skills " not aligned with the research that drove the model she suggested that she had in her school . Independent reading which is a crucial component of the Fountas and Pinnell program only averaged to be four minutes and 15 seconds per day at the GR school . A daily edit component , which was influenced by the state testing program , was added to the program by the school and took a large amount of the language arts block . The ethnographer estimated that the influence of the state mandates ( and not guided reading ) accounted for 62% of the curriculum in the language arts classes she observed ( Altwerger et al. , 2002 ) . <p> The OC principal had taught elementary school for 3 years . She had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following year . Her knowledge of Open Court was limited to a three-day training when the program was first implemented . She relied heavily on both the master teacher and the school system for the successful implementation of the OC program and for the essential professional development of her teachers . At the OC school , our ethnographer did not observe components of the program in all of the second grade classrooms . <p> The BLOCE principal had a Master 's Degree in Reading and had completed all but his dissertation in Educational Leadership . He shared with our researchers an oral literacy history of his school 's transitions from one reading program to another . Although he believed in the positive components of a whole language philosophy , he agreed with his school system to implement Open Court because of the research he read about the need for explicit phonics and his own analyses of his students ' test scores during the whole language era . The year of the study , though , he decided that he had to lead his school in a different way than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional development as part of his district administrators ' meetings , he was able to formulate the direction of a more balanced reading approach that he wanted for his school . INSTRUCTIONAL ROLEs of Principals : <p> In the DI school , the principal was an instructional leader but her decision making was based on her experience as a speech pathologist and not on reading research . The DI principal did add afternoon programs to meet the needs of the children in her school that the DI program did not address . <p> The GR principal had a very limited background in reading instruction and did not understand the research underpinnings of the program in her school . Additionally , she was very influenced by state curriculum politics . Approximately 62% of what our ethnographer observed being taught in the language arts block in this building were conflicting instructional paradigms that revealed a lack of adherence to the stated reading program ( Altwerger et al. , 2002 ) . <p> At the OC school , the principal gave over her leadership to the school system and her faculty and consequently was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classrooms . She depended on the school system to make the reading program decisions and do the professional development to put the resources in place . She shared that when she observed reading instruction in the classrooms that she was learning from the teachers . <p> The BLOCE principal provided classroom libraries , literacy center materials and supervised the professional development of his teachers . He was the instructional leader in improving reading instruction in his school . He often invited the district literacy consultant for this initiative into his school to do walk-thrus with him during the language arts block . At this time , he asked questions about the research , discussed recommendations with the consultant that he could share with the teachers , and requested additional reading he could do to better understand the research that influenced balanced reading instruction . He gave his teachers permission to learn , experiment and grow with him as a partner in this change process . Conclusion <p> Three concepts that enable an elementary principal to influence the school reading program and student test scores are : ( 1 ) the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational background the principal brings with her/him ; and ( 3 ) how the principal defines and applies her/his role as an instructional leader within the school . The principal of the BLOCK ( Balanced Literacy with Open Court Embedded ) school provided strong evidence of competency in each of these three categories . In education it is sometimes argued that it is the urban population in which it is the most difficult to elicit student reading achievements . Yet , BLOCE principal 's knowledge of reading instruction , coupled with his leadership in being the visionary and the lead professional developer of his faculty , enabled him to influence the school 's reading program and to increase student reading test scores in his urban school . <p> Our efforts to explore and develop a model to measure the effect of the elementary principal 's influence upon the school reading program and student reading achievement will require additional data from more principals . Currently , our research agenda includes observations and interviews from four elementary principals in Texas as we continue our quest to link student reading test scores with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elementary Principal Profiles &; Test Scores PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
