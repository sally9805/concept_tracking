Birthing choices I enjoyed your article " The Myths of Midwifery " ( March ) . I was lucky to have outstanding care from midwives for the births of my two daughters - one in the hospital and the other at home . I would like to point out that not all registered midwives have hospital privileges . In my community , a newly registered midwife was denied hospital privileges by the local obstetricians . Despite an outpouring of support from former midwifery clients and residents , the hospital did nothing to facilitate her being allowed to practise in hospital . As a result , the midwife moved on to a more welcoming hospital and the women in my area have been left with fewer birthing options . It is a shame that our medical system continues to allow doctors to call the shots . In this case , it was four men deciding on the birthing choices for the women in my community .

At my daughter 's school , apparently the teacher is allowed to leave and assume that the student supervisors will arrive . One day , my daughter 's finger was caught in the door . Why ? Because the teacher left before the student supervisors arrived . I fear for the future of our schools and the safety of our children . LUISA LEBLANC Concord , Ont . JOHN HOFFMAN MAKES some good points in his article about the apparent lack of adult supervision in many elementary schools at lunchtime . However , I disagree that the lack of supervision is " largely because collective agreements keep cutting the time teachers can spend doing noninstructional supervision . " I have been teaching in the elementary panel of the Toronto District School Board for 11 years , and my supervision time has steadily increased . Most teachers I know spend their lunch hours wolfing down sandwiches or microwaved meals , only to rush back to their classrooms to plan or to run co-curricular activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lunchtime preparing for teaching . If you want children to have quality programming , the answer is not to require teachers to do additional supervision ; it is to convince the board to pony up the dough for paid adult supervision when students are eating lunch . VICKY TEMPLIN Toronto Safe tub time RE : " WHAT YOU DO N'T KNOW CAN Hurt " ( March ) . Your article on the safety of bath seats advocates a ban on such seats in Canada . This is a knee-jerk reaction to what we believe could be a safe and helpful product for parents . When our daughter was five months old , she could no longer fit in the infant tub , but was unable to sit up . We used a bath seat until she was able to sit up comfortably . The instructions clearly indicated never to leave a child alone in the seat for even a second . We never did . If parents do n't use these seats properly , perhaps more obvious warnings are needed ( though we found it very obvious from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't punish everyone because some parents can not use a product the right way .

I grew up in the shadow of a brilliant engineer father and similarly smart older sister . My fear factor around math was intensely high . I am now a mid-40s mother of two children . A year ago , I decided to become an education assistant . The catch was I needed current grade11 math to get into the program . Two months later , I am almost through grade-10 math , and loving it . I had no idea I could do math , let alone understand it and find it fun and exhilarating . My kids watch me do my homework and want to help .

As a biological mom , stepmom and wife to a loving and involved father , I 've watched my stepchildren suffer emotionally as they were forced to choose loyalties - mom or dad . A child should never have to choose one parent over the other . Every child has a right to have meaningful relationships with both parents as well as grandparents and extended family when those parents do not live together .
