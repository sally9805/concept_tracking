Chapter One So many people I knew in the past are not yet reborn . I still miss them , even though I do not remember them . The axlotl tanks will soon remedy that . - Lady Jessica , The Ghola Aboard the wandering no-ship Ithaca , Jessica witnessed the birth of her daughter , but only as an observer . Just fourteen years old , she and many others crowded the medical center , while two Bene Gesserit Suk doctors in the adjacent creche prepared to extract the tiny girl child from an axlotl tank . " Alia , " one of the female doctors murmured . This was not truly Jessica 's daughter , but a ghola grown from preserved cells . None of the young gholas on the no-ship were " themselves " yet . They had regained none of their memories , none of their pasts . Something tried to surface at the back of her mind , and though she worried at it like a loose tooth , Jessica could not remember the first time Alia had been born . In the archives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Muad'Dib 's biographers . But she could n't remember . All she had were images from her studies : A dry and dusty sietch on Arrakis , surrounded by Fremen . Jessica and her son Paul had been on the run , taken in by the desert tribe . Duke Leto was dead , murdered by Harkonnens . Pregnant , Jessica had drunk the Water of Life , forever changing the fetus inside her . From the moment of her birth , the original Alia had been different from all other babies , filled with ancient wisdom and madness , able to tap into Other Memory without having gone through the Spice Agony . Abomination ! That had been another Alia . Another time and another way . Now Jessica stood beside her ghola " son " Paul , who was chronologically a year older than she . Paul waited with his beloved Fremen mate Chani and the nine-year-old ghola of a boy who had in turn been their son , Leto II . In a prior shuffle of lives , this had been Jessica 's family . The Bene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight against the terrible Outside Enemy that hunted them . They had Thufir Hawat , the planetologist Liet-Kynes , the Fremen leader Stilgar , and even the notorious Dr. Yueh . Now , after almost a decade of hiatus in the ghola program , Alia had joined the group . Others would come soon ; the three remaining axlotl tanks were already pregnant with new children : Gurney Halleck , Serena Butler , Xavier Harkonnen . Duncan Idaho gave Jessica a quizzical look . Eternal Duncan , with all of his memories restored from all of his prior lives . . . She wondered what he thought of this new ghola baby , a bubble of the past rising up to the present . Long ago , the first ghola of Duncan had been Alia 's consort . . . . Concealing his age well , Duncan was a full-grown man with dark wiry hair . He looked exactly like the hero shown in so many archival records , from the time of Muad'Dib , through the God Emperor 's thirty-five-century reign , to now , another fifteen centuries later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthing chamber accompanied by twelve-year-old Wellington Yueh . Young Yueh 's forehead did not bear the diamond tattoo of the famous Suk School . The bearded Rabbi seemed to think he could save the gangly young man from repeating the terrible crimes he had committed in his prior life . At the moment the Rabbi looked angry , as he invariably did whenever he came near the axlotl tanks . Since the Bene Gesserit doctors ignored him , the old man vented his displeasure on Sheeana . " After years of sanity , you have done it again ! When will you learn to stop taunting God ? " After receiving an ominous prescient dream , Sheeana had declared a temporary moratorium on the ghola project that had been her passion from its inception . But their recent ordeal on the planet of the Handlers and their near capture by the Enemy hunters had forced Sheeana to reassess that decision . The wealth of historical and tactical experience the reawakened gholas could offer might be the greatest weapon the no-ship possessed . Sheeana had decided to take the risk . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Or by one of the other gholas . . . Tempting fate , Sheeana had performed an experiment on this unborn ghola in an effort to make it more like the Alia . Estimating the point in the pregnancy when the original Jessica had consumed the Water of Life , Sheeana had instructed Bene Gesserit Suk doctors to flood the axlotl tank with a near-fatal spice overdose . Saturating the fetus . Trying to re-create an Abomination . Jessica had been horrified to learn of it-too late , when she could do nothing about it . How would the spice affect that innocent baby ? A melange overdose was different from undergoing the Agony . One of the Suk doctors told the Rabbi to stay out of the birthing creche . Scowling , the old man held up a trembling hand , as if making a blessing on the pale flesh of the axlotl tank . " You witches think these tanks are no longer women , no longer human-but this is still Rebecca . She remains a child of my flock . " " Rebecca fulfilled a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers knew exactly what they were doing . She accepted her responsibility . Why ca n't you ? " The Rabbi turned in exasperation toward the young man at his side . " Speak to them , Yueh . Maybe they will listen to you . " Jessica thought the sallow young ghola seemed more intrigued than incensed about the tanks . " As a Suk doctor , " he said , " I delivered many children . But never like this . At least I do n't think so . With my ghola memories still locked away , I get confused sometimes . " " And Rebecca is human-not just some biological machine to produce melange and a brood of gholas . You have to see that . " The Rabbi 's voice grew in volume . Yueh shrugged . " Because I was born in the same fashion , I can not be entirely objective . If my memories were restored , maybe I 'd agree with you . " " You do n't need original memories to think ! You can think , ca n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors interrupted . " We must decant it now . " She turned impatiently to the Rabbi . " Let us do our work-or the tank could be harmed as well . " With a sound of disgust , the Rabbi shouldered his way from the birthing creche . Yueh remained behind , continuing to watch . One of the Suk women tied off the umbilical cord from the fleshy tank . Her shorter colleague cut the purplish-red whip ; then she wiped off the slick infant and lifted little Alia into the air . The child let out a loud and immediate cry , as if she had been impatient to be born . Jessica sighed in relief at the healthy sound , which told her the girl was not an Abomination this time . The original newborn Alia had purportedly looked upon the world with the eyes and intelligence of a full adult . This baby 's crying sounded normal . But it stopped abruptly . While one doctor tended the now-sagging axlotl tank , the other dried the infant and wrapped her in a blanket . Unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach out and hold the baby , but resisted the urge . Would Alia suddenly start speaking , uttering voices from Other Memory ? Instead , the baby looked around the medical center , without seeming to focus . Others would care for Alia , not unlike the way Bene Gesserit sisters took baby girls under their collective wing . The first Jessica , born under the close scrutiny of breeding mistresses , had never known a mother in the traditional sense . Nor would this Jessica , nor Alia , nor any of the other experimental ghola babies . The new daughter would be raised communally in an improvised society , more an object of scientific curiosity than love . " What an odd family we all are , " Jessica whispered . Humans are never capable of complete accuracy . Despite all the knowledge and experiences we have absorbed from countless Face Dancer " ambassadors , " we are left with a confused picture . Nonetheless , the flawed accounts of human history provide amusing insights into the delusions of mankind . - Erasmus , Records and Analyses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking machines had not yet captured the no-ship and its precious cargo . That did not , however , stop the computer evermind from launching his vast extermination fleet against the rest of humanity . Duncan Idaho continued to elude Omnius and Erasmus , who repeatedly cast their sparkling tachyon net into the nothingness , searching for their quarry . The no-ship 's veiling capability normally prevented it from being seen , but from time to time the pursuers caught glimpses , as of something concealed behind shrubbery . At first the hunt had been a challenge , but now the evermind was growing frustrated . " You have lost the ship again , " Omnius boomed through wall speakers in the central , cathedral-like chamber in the technological metropolis of Synchrony . " Inaccurate . I must first find it before I can lose it . " Erasmus tried to sound carefree as he shifted his flowmetal skin , reverting from his guise as a kindly old woman to the more familiar appearance of a platinum-surfaced robot . Like overarching tree trunks , metal spires towered above Erasmus to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the activated skins of the pillars , bathing his new laboratory in light . He had even installed a glowing fountain that bubbled with lava-a useless decoration , but the robot often indulged his carefully cultivated artistic sensibilities . " Do not be impatient . Remember the mathematical projections . Everything is nicely predetermined . " " Your mathematical projections could be myths , like any prophecy . How do I know they are correct ? " " Because I have said they are correct . " With the launch of the machine fleet , the long-foretold Kralizec had begun , at last . Kralizec . . . Armageddon . . . the Battle at the End of the Universe . . . Ragnarok . . . Azrafel . . . the End Times . . . the Cloud Darkness . It was a time of fundamental change , of the entire universe shifting on its cosmic axis . Human legends had predicted such a cataclysmic event since the dawn of civilization . Indeed , they had already been through several iterations of similar cataclysms : the Butlerian Jihad itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tyrant Leto II . By manipulating computer projections , and thus creating expectations in the mind of Omnius , Erasmus had succeeded in initiating the events that would bring about another fundamental shift . Prophecy and reality-the order of things really did n't matter . Like an arrow , all of Erasmus 's infinitely complex calculations , running trillions of data points through the most sophisticated routines , pointed to one result : The final Kwisatz Haderach-whoever that was-would determine the course of events at the end of Kralizec . The projection also revealed that the Kwisatz Haderach was on the no-ship , so Omnius naturally wanted such a force fighting on his side . Ergo , the thinking machines needed to capture that ship . The first to exert control over the final Kwisatz Haderach would win . Erasmus did n't fully understand exactly what the superhuman might do when he was located and seized . Though the robot was a longtime student of mankind , he was still a thinking machine , while the Kwisatz Haderach was not . The new Face Dancers , who had long infiltrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell somewhere in between , like hybrid biological machines . He and Omnius had both absorbed so many of the lives stolen by the Face Dancers that sometimes they forgot who they were . The original Tleilaxu Masters had not foreseen the significance of what they had helped create . The independent robot knew he still had to keep Omnius under control , though . " We have time . You have a galaxy to conquer before we need the Kwisatz Haderach aboard that ship . " " I am glad I did not wait for you to succeed . " For centuries Omnius had been building his invincible force . Using traditional but supremely efficient lightspeed engines , the millions and millions of machine vessels now swept forward and spread out , conquering one star system at a time . The evermind could have made use of the surrogate mathematical navigation systems , which his Face Dancers had " given " to the Spacing Guild , but one element of the Holtzman technology simply remained too incomprehensible . Something indefinably human was required to travel through foldspace , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never admit that the bizarre technology actually made him . . . nervous .
