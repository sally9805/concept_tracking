My side of the story Perhaps you 'd care to hear my side of the story ? Here am I , Ralph William Mountfield , banished to my bedroom on Christmas Day , with no one even giving me a chance to explain . But it was all Titania 's fault , really . Everyone said we were just putting on an act when we stood , hands spread , mouths open , insisting there was nothing we could have done . " Acting all injured , " said Aunt Miriam . " If you put both of them in a bag and punched it , whichever one you hit would deserve it , " said Great-granny . But everyone knows I ca n't act . My brother , Harry , can . He played the Slough of Despond -- that means bog of despair -- when our school put on Pilgrim 's Progress , and it 's not easy , acting a mud swamp . But all I 've ever been allowed to be is one of the oysters in " The Walrus and the Carpenter " in this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I looked far too happy while I was being eaten . ) So I could n't have been putting it on . But even if I were , I would have been about the only person in the house who was n't wearing a false face and saying things they did n't mean . Titania 's Christmas Quiz proved that . Titania Neither Harry nor I can stand Titania . ( No one can , actually . ) Her mum is our mum 's sister , so we are cousins , and ever since she was born she 's come to stay twice a year . She was n't too bad when she was a baby . Even as a toddler she was n't all that much trouble , lying for hours in her little barred travel bed , talking to her fingers . ( I even caught her singing to the wallpaper once -- a song called " Mucking About in the Garden . " ) We had a good game with her too.You see , for years , she could n't say her rs properly , so Harry and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till she told us we were " weally wery wubbish ! " But then Aunt Susan decided that Titania was " gifted . " ( Everyone in our family thought she was just a dreadful know-all , but there you are , that 's parents for you . ) And after that , Titania became intolerable . We had to sit quietly about a million times ( without even being allowed to snigger ) while she did her " I 'm a Little Teapot " performance . Then she took to saying that she could see fairies at the bottom of the garden , and wearing frocks so stupid and frilly that once , when she lost her pretend diamond necklace , it must have been half an hour before it even managed to work its way far enough down to get found again in her knickers . I used to have to hold her hand all the way to the shop when she wanted to buy her " fairy dust " ( pink sherbet ) . It was embarrassing . I used to tell everyone she was off to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . If it was his turn to take her , he 'd simply bribe me into doing it . " What , only fifty pence ? " I 'd complain . " It 's not much , is it ? " he 'd admit . " But it looks quite a lot , sitting next to nothing . " So I 'd agree to go . Harry gets what he wants a lot more often than I do . He 's a year older than I am and Mum 's favorite . ( Mum says she does n't have a favorite , but I was n't born yesterday . ) The rest of the family The easiest way of introducing you to everyone else is to tell you three of the things I heard them saying over the last two days . MUM : " Oh , Ralph . Be an angel and see if the coast is clear all the way to the bathroom . " " Ralph , darling , would you just carry this toast through for me ? " " Ralph , poppet . Be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " DAD : " I regret , Ralph , that , due to the demands of this stupid oversized turkey , this area of the kitchen is temporarily closed to idle traffic such as yourself . " " My head feels like a lump of boiled owl . " " Does anyone else think this toast tastes like buttered Brillo pads ? " UNCLE TRISTRAM ( he 's my mum 's brother , and he 's thirty-one ) : " Hi , Ralph . I was just enjoying myself throwing spuds at this cat through the window . " " Shhh ! Do n't distract me . I 'm listing the ten things I hate most about Great-granny . " " I found this child abandoned in the bath . It 's wrinkled as a prune . Does anyone want it ? " GREAT-GRANNY : " If I had my own teeth , I 'd bite you . " " By the time I was your age , I had read Milton . " " Try not to act sillier than you look . " GREAT-AUNT IDA : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what with my very weak wrist . . . " " I 'd offer to lay the dining room table for lunch for you , Tansy , but my poor dear wrist would simply shriek , ' No ! ' " " Help wash up ? Oh , impossible ! My wrist bone is as brittle as crispbread . Ca n't you find someone else ? " GRANDPA ( this will be easier to follow if I explain that Grandpa mostly walks round with his toolbox , singing to our dog , Bruno , and explaining to him how he plans to fix things ) : " I ca n't go hunting with you , Jake , ' Cause I 'm out chasin ' wimmin . . . " " As you 'll see , Bruno , someone has used quite the wrong size of screw here , and that has contributed appreciably to the problem . " " Roses round the door , Babies on the floor , Happy vall-eee , happy vall-ee -- And yoo-oooo . " There are a few more people in the house , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to Santa On Christmas Eve morning , everyone arrived in their separate clumps , and there was all the usual fuss about bagging the best beds and warmest rooms . Great-granny wanted windows facing south . ( " So she can quarrel with the moon all night , " Dad suggested . ) Then Great-aunt Ida had to tell us all about her " twisted wrist . " ( " That makes a change , " said Mum . " Usually it 's a sprained ankle so she can park in the comfiest chair and not move for six days . " ) After that , Titania had one of her " sensitive " fits , saying she would n't be able to sleep in the room she 'd been given because " the wall has got stains in the shapes of ugly faces . " " You ought to feel more at home , then , " Harry said . He got sent to his room for that . So then , of course , I was the one who had to swap beds with Titania . ( And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Aunt Susan dragged everyone out for a nature walk . ( Harry got out of it by pretending he had n't heard Mum say he could come down again . ) There is a limit to how exciting anyone can make the life history of a holly berry sound , so I was n't really listening when she went on to mistletoe.
