So all right , thought Peterson , he was speaking English , and , all right , so the map was from America . Well , naturally . And so , all right , the names of towns were spelled differently here and pronounced differently . But come on , had n't this country been open to tourism for at least ten years ? <p> " C-h-i-n-k-o , " said Peterson , pronouncing the name of the town very distinctly . " C-h-i-n-k-o . I want to take the train to C-h-i-n-k-o . " <p> But the clerk standing behind the ticket counter at the railway station kept frowning . A second clerk , seated at a wooden desk behind the counter , watched . <p> " See , " said Peterson , pointing at the map that he had placed on the counter upside down to him but right-side up for the clerk . " See ? Here . This is where we are . Right here . " Peterson showed exactly with his finger . " And over here , right here , this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Still frowning , the first clerk took the map over to the second clerk sitting at the desk . They both studied the map and spoke in some incomprehensible language . <p> Then the second clerk said , " Cakovecza . " <p> " Cakovecza ! " said the first clerk . <p> The first clerk brought the map back to the counter , laid it out right-side up for him but upside down for Peterson , and pointed at the town that on the map said , upside down , " Chinko . " <p> " Cakovecza , " said the clerk . <p> " Cakovecza ? " said Peterson . <p> The clerk took a piece of paper and printed a word on it and pushed the piece of paper across the counter to Peterson . <p> Peterson looked at the piece of paper . The word printed on it said : " Cakovecza . " <p> The second clerk , the one seated at the wooden desk , had already inserted a blank ticket into the roller of a big , black typewriter , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the piece of paper . Well , yes , there was a certain resemblance between the two words , " Chinko " and " Cakovecza . " Both started with a " C , " for example . So perhaps it was possible that " Chinko " was the English spelling of " Cakovecza . " On the other hand , maybe they were n't the same town at all . Maybe the clerks had made a mistake . An honest mistake . Perhaps he would get on the train and find himself going where he did n't want to go . <p> The second clerk spun the finished ticket out of the typewriter roller , placed the ticket on the desk in front of him , whacked it with several different stamps , took a pen , inserted something over the stamped parts of the ticket , and handed the ticket to the first clerk . <p> " Zog ! " said the first clerk , carrying the finished ticket to the counter and pushing it towards Peterson . <p> " How much ? " said Peterson . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took another piece of paper , wrote something on it , and also pushed the paper over to Peterson . <p> Peterson had a look . The clerk had written " 150,350 . " All right . But 150,350 what ? Of course , 150,350 units of this country 's basic currency . But Peterson had to admit that he had no idea what that basic unit was . He had asked about it in Munich . Oh , they 'll take your euros , you can bet your life on that , he had been told . <p> So Peterson pulled a fifty-euro bill out of his wallet . <p> " Euros ? " he said . <p> The clerk lifted the bill from Peterson 's hand and took it over to the second clerk sitting at the desk . The second clerk pulled out the drawer of the desk , put the bill in there , took out some coins , gave the coins to the first clerk , who brought them over to Peterson . <p> Peterson looked at the strange coins in his hand . They certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That meant he had paid almost fifty euros for his ticket . That was about fifty dollars . Fifty dollars ? To Chinko ? Only to Chinko ? Not even an hour 's ride away ? <p> Unless , of course , these clerks had gotten the two towns mixed up . In an honest mistake . Because that could explain it . Maybe it did cost around fifty dollars to get to Cakovecza . Maybe Cakovecza was a lot farther away than Chinko . <p> " Excuse me , " said Peterson . <p> Both clerks stood at the desk looking at Peterson . <p> " I do n't think ... " he started , but gave it up . Probably both of them had survived the purges , and nothing that he could do now was going to change anything . So instead he pointed to the schedule board on the wall , then to his watch , and asked , " When ? " <p> " Zog ! " said the first clerk , who found another piece of paper , wrote out something , and pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much , " said Peterson . <p> He looked at the piece of paper , made out that train 4012 left at 16:26 from track two , put the piece of paper in his shirt pocket along with the ticket , folded up the map , and slipped it in his back pocket , extracted the long handle out of the top of the suitcase , and pulled the suitcase along behind him out of the ticket office and past the waiting room/cafee and towards the train tracks . <p> And saw a difficulty ahead of him . <p> If his train had been leaving on track one , it would have been all right . He simply would have pulled his suitcase through the door ahead of him and out onto the platform . But he saw that to get to tracks two and three he had to go down a stairway , then along an underground corridor which crossed under the tracks , and then undoubtedly up another stairway . <p> The problem was his suitcase . Getting it up and down that stairway . To be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mattered because with the handle pulled out all the way the suitcase was perfectly balanced , and as you walked along pulling it behind you , you just did n't feel it , the weight . Plus , he 'd had porters to help him at the Munich and the Vienna train stations . <p> But now he saw that he himself was going to have to drag the suitcase down this one flight of stairs and up another . <p> Peterson edged his suitcase over to the staircase and clunked it down one step . Then another . And another . Until he reached the landing halfway down . Actually , thought Peterson , the impact of all that weight on the wheels might be too much . Probably he ought to carry the suitcase . So he pushed the extended handle in and gripped the regular handle . My God ! He really had overpacked ! He found he had to lean his body way over to one side to balance himself as he carried it down . <p> At least in the underground corridor he could extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollers . But naturally the corridor smelled of urine , and naturally there was a lot of graffiti on the walls . Peterson even saw a " Fuck you ! " written in English . Perhaps , it occurred to him , that during the Communist times there had n't been any of this , that is , not only the " Fuck you ! " but the graffiti as well . Although , who knew ? Maybe that sort of thing went on regardless of the government . <p> Peterson paused at the bottom of the stairway going up to tracks two and three and saw daylight up there . He looked back down the corridor past the " Fuck you ! " to see if by any possible chance he 'd missed an elevator . But , of course , he had n't . <p> So , nothing for it . He pushed the extended handle down into the suitcase , grabbed the regular handle , braced his body , and lifted . Again , my God ! Up one step , pause , up another , pause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? Maybe later he could take some things out . Just leave stuff behind . <p> At the top of the stairway Peterson eased the suitcase down on the train platform and found himself between two waiting trains , one at track two and one at track three . The cars of both trains seemed antique , as if perhaps they were museum pieces put out here on display , the bodies of the cars very square and resting high off the wheels . <p> Peterson extracted the handle of the suitcase and began to pull the suitcase along between the two trains towards the departure boards . But now , even though he was up on the level again , the suitcase did n't follow along behind him as effortlessly as before . Well , that was because the surface of the train platform was old and cracked . Either that , or the wheels had been damaged by that clunking down the steps . <p> At the departure board for track two , he pulled out the ticket and the piece of paper from his shirt pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board matched the number on the paper , 4012 , and down the list of the town names , " Nagyada , " " Dioskal , " " Szapeth , " and " Ikervar , " he saw " Cakovecza , " which also matched the name on his ticket . But no " Chinko . " Unless , of course , " Cakovecza " and " Chinko " were the same town . Which was probably true . <p> Peterson turned to look down the train platform to see if there was another departure board and saw an apparition of a man approaching him . Well , the man was n't an apparition , of course . He was real enough . It was just that he was dressed so outlandishly in a red and green uniform all covered with braids and epaulets and stripes , as if he had stepped out of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta or was a holdover from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire . The man walked with a pronounced limp , almost dragging one foot , which caused his head to bob up and down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , he looked old enough to almost be a holdover from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire , the skin of his face gnarled , a large wart on his cheek , his eyes watery , and his ears standing out and away from under his peaked hat . <p> It was only when the man stopped right in front of Peterson that Peterson saw the whistle hung around his neck and the little round metal sign , red on one side and green on the other , that he carried in his hand . <p> The train master , Peterson now understood . This was the man who whistled the trains off . <p> " Excuse me , " said Peterson . " Chinko ? " Peterson pointed to the departure board and said still more distinctly , " C-h-i-n-k-o ? " <p> " Tschesno ? " said the man in a barely audible , reedy voice . <p> " C-h-i-n-k-o ? " said Peterson again . <p> The man , without looking at the departure board and counting on the fingers of his hand , said , " Nagyada , Dioskal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cakovecza ? So , this train goes to Cakovecza ? " <p> The man focused his watery eyes on Peterson . " Zog . Cakovecza ! " <p> " Thanks very much , " said Peterson . <p> The old man 's fingers found the bill of his cap , and he bowed slightly to Peterson . <p> Peterson made a slight bow in return , realizing at the same time that he had n't learned anything . He already knew this train , the one on track two , went to Cakovecza . That was the name of the town on his ticket . The question was , were Cakovecza and Chinko the same town ? Because if they were n't , why should he get on this train and go where he did n't want to go ? <p> " Excuse me , " said Peterson . <p> But the old man had already turned and was walking away , the one foot dragging , his head bobbing up and down . <p> Well , thought Peterson , undoubtedly Cakovecza and Chinko were the same town . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that well now , probably it was the uneven surface of the platform , up to the nearest car on track two , pushed in the extended handle of his suitcase , grabbed the regular handle , braced himself , and gave a heave . He just managed to get the suitcase up onto the floor of the car . Peterson climbed into the car next to the suitcase , drew the handle out , and began to pull the suitcase down the aisle of double-facing seats . <p> Peterson stopped in front of one of the pairs of facing seats , again pushed the extended handle of his suitcase in , and again grabbed the regular handle . But this time he could n't get the suitcase all the way up to the luggage rack above him . It was just too heavy . So he guided it back down onto the seat . <p> But that was all right because as he looked around the car he saw he was the only passenger . So it did n't matter . His suitcase could just stay where it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rack . <p> Except that it was too heavy . <p> Nevertheless , since it was beside him , Peterson undid the latches and saw the lid pop up from the compression beneath it . The wonder was how he 'd managed to get all that stuff in there . Not just all the clothing and the two extra pairs of shoes , but even his books and the folder containing all the draft manuscripts . <p> He looked at his watch and saw that he had another twenty-five minutes before the train left . So , why not ? he opened the folder containing his draft manuscripts and pulled one of them out and arranged it on his lap . Yes , why not ? <p> He had just started to read the first words of the first paragraph , " A systemic examination into the morphology of certain previously unobserved links ... , " when he heard a sound he could n't quite believe . Music . A Dixieland band . " Sweet Georgia Brown . " A Dixieland band ? Here ? In this town ? In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the manuscript back down on top of the suitcase and crossed the aisle to the other side of the train and pulled down the window in order to hear the music better . To his surprise he saw that the platform over on track one was beginning to fill with revelers of some sort , people dressed as clowns and ghosts and goblins , a man with an enormous hat pretending to ride a horse and four or five people on different length stilts and absurdly long pants . Then-so he had been right-a Dixieland band , six men , each with a red blazer and a blue straw hat , the man with the sliding trombone leading the way and the banjo player bringing up the rear , marched right to the edge of track one . The trombone player swung his instrument this way and that , and the banjo player got down on his knees , ratcheting up " Sweet Georgia Brown . " Behind the Dixieland band the people on stilts were reaching into bags at their sides and tossing out candy . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession also crowded onto the platform , a fake king and queen and fake attendants , princes and princesses , dukes and duchesses , more men with coats of arms pretending to ride horses , more people on stilts , and finally priests in black robes and black hoods , the lead priest carrying a large , shiny golden cross . <p> " Fasching . " That word drifted into Peterson 's mind . Had n't he read about this festival somewhere ? The middle of February ? Carnival ? A religious connection ? Something to do with Lent ? Thus the priests and the cross ? <p> Whatever the celebration was about , it now seemed to be over , as if the railway station were the endpoint of the parade . The Dixieland band had stopped playing , the musicians were now beginning to put their instruments away , some of the royal personages and the clowns and ghosts were taking off their costumes , the men on stilts were slipping down against the walls , and some quite normal-looking person was going around with a coffee thermos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a very nice thing to happen . Although Peterson was sorry that the Dixieland band had stopped playing . He had especially enjoyed that . Pulled at something inside of him . Deep out of the past . " Sweet Georgia Brown . " <p> Many of the revelers , now carrying their costumes , were heading back through the doors into the train station , but also , Peterson saw , many had started to disappear down the stairway which led to tracks two and three . And sure enough , soon he could see the same stream of people reappearing . Half began to board his train , and half began to board the train on track three . Peterson crossed in front of his suitcase and sat down in his seat just as the first of the newcomers came down the aisle . In a matter of a minute or so , most of the seats were taken . <p> " Excuse , excuse , " said a boy who belonged to a group of young people . They were holding their discarded costumes in their arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue and white paint . One of the girls wore a golden wig . " Excuse , " the boy repeated . <p> Peterson indicated that it was certainly all right for them to sit beside him . He pushed down on the lid of the suitcase , finally getting the latches to lock , stepped out into the aisle , and was about to grab the handle when two of the boys took the suitcase and lifted it , seemingly effortlessly , up to the rack above the seats . <p> " Thanks very much , " said Peterson . <p> " Chjerszte ! " said one of the boys . <p> Four of these young people sat on the seat opposite Peterson , and two squeezed in beside him . One of the boys had a plastic hamper and began to take bottles of beer out of it , while one of the girls , the one sitting directly opposite Peterson , started taking off her golden wig . <p> Just at that moment Peterson noticed that the revelers in the train on the opposite side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were waving to the people in his train . Holding her wig in one hand , the girl sitting across from Peterson pulled their window down , and , since Peterson was the one sitting next to the window on his side , he stood up , leaned through it , and looked at the sea of hands reaching out from the other train . He especially looked at a group of girls in red blouses and red scarves , crowded around three windows in the car just opposite , who were making exaggerated operatic gestures of love and despair to the occupants of Peterson 's car . One of these girls saw Peterson and began to blow him kisses . Not ordinary kisses , but slow kisses , out along her hand , the fingers of her hand fluttering after each kiss . <p> Peterson was just beginning to think of returning her kisses when the old man , the train master , the one with the gnarled face and outfitted in his ridiculous red and green uniform and dragging his foot as he walked , raised his round metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew his whistle . The train on track three eased forward and then stopped . The old man still kept his sign high in the air . More jeering from passengers at the windows of both trains , and the train on track three started up again . <p> " Excuse , excuse , " said one of the boys sitting next to Peterson . The boy was offering Peterson a bottle of beer . <p> " Thanks , " said Peterson , taking a bottle . The beer inside the bottle looked very dark . <p> " Chjerszte ! " said the boy , holding up his bottle for a toast . <p> " Chjerszte ! " said Peterson , trying to copy how the boy said the word and also holding up his bottle . <p> The other young people held up their bottles . <p> His manuscript ! Peterson had just put the lip of the bottle to his mouth when he remembered his manuscript . Where was it ? He had been reading it , something about unobserved links , and now it was n't here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he heard a whistle right outside the train window and , when he looked , saw the old man in the red and green uniform holding up his round metal sign . <p> Peterson 's train jerked forward , causing those in the aisles to reach out for the seat handles to steady themselves . The train went some yards down the track , then came to a halt . Peterson leaned out the window and looked back at the old man . He was still holding his round metal sign up in the air . <p> Another jerk , and the train started off again . The old man grew smaller and smaller back there on the train platform . <p> Peterson retracted his head back through the window , pulled the window down , and turned to the young people . <p> " Chjerszte ! " he said , and brought the bottle of beer up to his lips and drank . And thought back to that girl floating kisses to him . Of course it had all been just in fun . Nothing serious . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Peterson was just taking another swallow of his beer when he saw the conductor come down the aisle , checking tickets . <p> " Excuse me , " said Peterson when the conductor got to his group . " Chinko ? Does this train go to Chinko . " The conductor took Peterson 's ticket , looked at it , punched it , and moved on . <p> " Excuse , " said the girl across from Peterson , the one who had been wearing the golden wig . " You were English ? " <p> " Am I English ? " <p> " Zog ! Excuse . Only school English . " <p> " I 'm American , " said Peterson . <p> " American ! " said the girl . <p> " American ! " said several of the other young people . <p> " I get uncle in Denver , " said one of the boys . <p> " Ah , Denver ! " said Peterson . <p> " California ! She super beautiful ? " said another of the boys . <p> " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now go ? " asked the girl . <p> " Chinko , " said Peterson . When none of them responded to this , he repeated the name of the town slowly , as he had in the ticket office . " C-h-i-n-k-o . " <p> " Chinko ? " said one of the girls . <p> " Just a moment , " said Peterson . He reached for his map in his back pants pocket and unfolded it . " See ? Here . Chinko . " He pointed with his finger . <p> The girl took the map , and all the young people on the seat opposite Peterson looked at the map and began to talk in their incomprehensible language . <p> " Or maybe Cakovecza , " said Peterson . <p> " Cakovecza ? " said the girl . <p> " Maybe , " said Peterson . <p> " Zog ! Cakovecza ! " said the girl . <p> " Cakovecza ! " said the boy . <p> They all smiled and handed the map back to Peterson . <p> " So , " said Peterson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinko is the same as Cakovecza ? " When they just looked at him , he added , " Or Cakovecza is the same as Chinko ? " <p> At that moment the daylight went to night , and the air pressure pushed against Peterson 's eardrums , and he realized the train had gone into a tunnel . All but two of the young people sitting with him got up and started collecting their costumes . The train began to slow even before it got out of the tunnel . When the daylight returned , Peterson saw that at least half the people in the car were getting up to leave . <p> " Goodbye , " said the girl . She reached out and shook Peterson 's hand . Then each of the young people in turn shook Peterson 's hand , each saying goodbye . <p> As soon as the train stopped , Peterson pulled the window down , and as he had expected and hoped , the young people came down the platform to Peterson 's window . <p> " Goodbye , American friend , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand again . <p> " I visit you in California , " said another boy . <p> " It was much pleasure to meet you , " said the girl . <p> " California ! " said one of the boys . <p> " California ! " said Peterson . <p> " Zog ! " said the girl . <p> Peterson heard a whistle , the train jerked forward , pushing him against the rim of the window . All the young people waved , and Peterson waved back at them , and at the very end , when he almost could n't see them anymore , he blew the girl a kiss . Whether she saw him doing that or not , Peterson could n't tell . But now he was looking at the rest of the town as it slipped past . How dreary , he thought . All those small stone houses , the bare yards , the dirt streets . Surely those young people did n't have to live in a place like this . <p> And , anyway , too bad they had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Chjerszte ! " and so forth . Whatever that word meant . And as the train picked up speed and Peterson pushed the window closed and sat down again , he saw that the two remaining young people , the boy and a girl sitting opposite him , were engaged in some kind of serious conversation . It was no longer important to them that he was an interesting American , a visitor to their country . <p> And , anyway , he found himself distracted by a woman who had just gotten on the train and was sitting in the next row of seats . She had deposited a number of plastic sacks around her and was in the process of going through each one of them , apparently moving objects out of one into another and then maybe into still another . Peterson could hear the rustling and rattling of plastic even above the sound of the train . <p> Suddenly Peterson remembered his manuscript . He had been reading it before all those young people got on the train . Where was it ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor came down the aisle asking for the tickets of those who had just gotten on . The woman in the next row of seats up from Peterson rattled her plastic sacks and said something to the conductor . <p> " Zajka ? " said the conductor . <p> The woman raised her voice , almost shouting at the conductor . Other people in the car turned to look at the woman . <p> " Zajka ! " said the conductor . <p> Again the train went into a tunnel , the air pressure pushed on Peterson 's eardrums , and most of the rest of the people in the car , including the two young people opposite him , the boy and the girl , began to get up and collect their costumes . Even the woman started to collect her plastic bags . Peterson guessed that she could n't find her ticket , or did n't even have a ticket , and the conductor had told her she had to get off . <p> In fact , as soon as the train came out of the tunnel and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peterson did n't understand at all , began to harangue the other passengers who had gotten up from their seats . When they ignored her , she turned to Peterson , her face now quite red . <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Peterson . " But I do n't speak your language . " <p> " Smykalla ! " said the woman , shouting . <p> " I do n't know your language . " <p> " Du bist ein fucker , " said the woman , gripping all her plastic bags and moving down the aisle , the bags hitting the sides of the seats . <p> Again Peterson pulled the window next to him down , thinking that maybe the two young people would come along the platform and shake his hand and say things about California , or at least about America . But he saw them walking into the interior of the station without even looking back . Only the lady with all the plastic bags remained on the platform . She had found an old man in a red and green uniform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . <p> Peterson did n't believe it . This old man was the same old man Peterson had seen at the first train station . At least he wore the same outlandish Austrian-Hungarian operetta outfit . Had this old man come along with the train , maybe riding in the front car with the engineer ? <p> But when the old man turned to raise his round metal sign and blow his whistle , Peterson saw it was n't the same man , or , at least , probably was n't the same man . Well , it could n't have been the same man . <p> Although , admittedly , it was getting a little dark to see now . Partly that was because it was late in the afternoon and partly because they seemed to be in a mountain valley that shut out what was left of the sun . <p> The train started up with another jerk , began to slide by more stone houses , bare yards , and dirt roads . Peterson pushed the window back up and looked around his car . The lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the time and he had just not noticed it . As far as he could tell , all the happy people , the revelers , had gotten off by now and only a few people had gotten on . And they were dour-looking types , a woman with a headscarf , some kind of workman wearing rubber boots , and a man , probably at least partly blind , because he held a white cane next to him . Certainly no chance of a lively conversation here . No more talk about California . Or America . Outside the window , the valley had narrowed down , the mountain wall coming in quite close . <p> And Peterson remembered : his manuscript ! <p> He stepped out into the aisle , kneeled down , and looked under the seat , and , thank God , saw the manuscript lying under the seat in front of him . He knelt down even farther , reached under the seat , retrieved it , sat down again . He started to read the opening paragraph again : " A systemic examination into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And stopped reading . Was n't this the point where something interesting , something pleasant had happened ? " Sweet Georgia Brown " ? Something out of the past ? <p> He looked out the window again . Perhaps he saw some snowflakes slipping past . He was n't sure . The air pressure changed , and Peterson assumed they were in another tunnel . And sure enough , even before the end of the tunnel , the train began to slow for the next station . Peterson put the manuscript down on the seat next to him and watched the man with the white cane get out of his seat and walk down the aisle . <p> At the station , two people got on , a girl of about twelve who wore a long , yellow plastic raincoat and a tall , well-built man with prematurely white hair . Since he wore a red-checked woolen shirt and mountain-type boots , Peterson decided that he was a woodsman . Probably was n't . But that 's what Peterson decided . <p> A whistle blew , the train started up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed , and came to a complete stop . Outside , back against the lights from the train station , Peterson could see the train master in one of those operetta-type uniforms walking in the opposite direction . <p> Peterson took the map out of his shirt pocket , unfolded it , stood up , and went over to the workman with the rubber boots . <p> " Chinko ? " said Peterson , pointing first at the map and then at the front of the train . <p> The man studied the map . <p> " C-h-i-n-k-o , " Peterson said again . <p> The man said something Peterson did n't understand . <p> " Is this train going to C-h-i-n-k-o ? " <p> Again the man said something Peterson did n't understand . <p> The train started with a jerk , almost upsetting Peterson . <p> " Thanks so much , " said Peterson , taking the map from the man and going back and sitting down in his seat just as the train went into another tunnel . After the tunnel Peterson leaned his face against the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . He thought that maybe he saw the side of a mountain . But he was n't sure . <p> Suddenly Peterson found himself having to hold on to his seat to keep from sliding off it as he heard the screech and ringing of the wheels as the train strained to a stop . <p> Peterson eased back into his seat . Clearly that had been an emergency stop . <p> But as he looked over at the other passengers , the workman with the rubber boots , the girl in the plastic raincoat , and the man in the red-checked shirt , none of them , as far as he could tell , seemed to think anything had happened out of the ordinary . <p> Just then the conductor walked very quickly down the aisle in the opposite direction the train had been going and exited into the car behind . Even if he had known the language , which he did n't , of course , Peterson would have had trouble asking the conductor what was going on . <p> Peterson had no more than leaned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and see something , when the conductor walked quickly back up the aisle in the opposite direction as before . Why did n't someone else ask him ? thought Peterson . One of the other passengers ? <p> The train started moving again . But in reverse . The train was going backwards ! <p> After maybe two minutes , the train stopped . <p> Again , Peterson looked at the other passengers in the car . They sat there as before . <p> A popping and whining . Then a man clearing his voice . It was the train 's loudspeaker system . The man said something in a measured tone , then more popping , a wheezing , and the loudspeaker system went off . <p> Peterson saw the other passengers in the car get up and start to walk towards the front of the train . <p> " Excuse me , " said Peterson to the workman with rubber boots . <p> The man motioned Peterson to follow him . <p> " Why ? What 's happening ? " said Peterson , but the man had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . <p> Peterson reached up to the luggage rack , struggled his suitcase down to the floor , extended the handle , and began to pull it along the aisle . The door was a problem . Or rather , the doors . He could get the suitcase through the door of his car all right , but as he reached forward to get the rear door of the next car open as well , the first door closed on his suitcase , and when he reached back to open that door again , the door in front of him closed . He had to go through this process three times before he arrived at the final car , a kind of baggage car where he found the other passengers , not only the ones from his car but other cars as well , seated along the sides of the baggage car . There must have been twenty people in all . The conductor was standing at the front making a speech . Peterson parked his suitcase , took a seat at the end , and pretended to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor . It was just that he had no idea what he was saying . <p> " Zog , " said one of the passengers . <p> " Zog , " said another . <p> Peterson understood that the conductor was asking each passenger in turn a question . When the conductor asked Peterson the same question , whatever that was , he also replied , " Zog . " <p> People were standing and putting on their coats , and one passenger had already opened a side door and had stepped out into the night . <p> " Excuse , " said Peterson , leaving his suitcase and going up to the conductor . " What 's going on ? " <p> " Boos , " said the conductor . " Boos . " <p> " Bus , " said somebody else . <p> " Ah , bus ! " said Peterson . " We 're going to meet a bus ? " <p> In any case , Peterson had no choice , because all the rest of the passengers had already stepped out of the side door into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , hauled the suitcase over to the door , swung out himself , grabbed the regular handle of the suitcase , and pulled the suitcase out and lowered it down onto the ground . Or gravel . Or cinders . Whatever was beneath his feet . <p> And tried to follow the other passengers as they walked along the length of the locomotive and then out ahead of the locomotive . Of course , here there was no question of pulling his suitcase . The gravel or cinders or whatever was beneath his feet was too rough for that . So he simply lugged it , leaning to one side , not quite believing again how heavy it was , all the time falling farther and farther behind the other passengers , until he could n't see them anymore . <p> " Taroj ! " <p> That was the conductor passing Peterson , his feet making crunching sounds on the gravel or cinders . <p> " Hello ! Excuse ! " said Peterson . <p> The conductor walked out ahead of Peterson until he , too , disappeared into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to keep going , that he had no choice but to keep going , but his suitcase was too heavy . So he put it down . Just for a moment . For a small moment . Below him , off to one side , he thought he heard the rushing of a river . <p> As he was listening to the river , he also heard the crunching sounds of somebody walking towards him . <p> " Taroj . " <p> It was the woodsman . The man with the prematurely white hair and the red-checked woolen shirt . Not that Peterson could see those features all that clearly now . But he still recognized the person as the woodsman . <p> " What 's going on ? " said Peterson . <p> The woodsman reached down , grabbed hold of Peterson 's suitcase , and started back in the direction he had come from . Peterson almost had to hurry to keep up with the woodsman and not lose sight of him in the darkness . <p> Until he heard voices and saw the forms of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase down , and Peterson realized that these people were , of course , the other passengers who had been on the train . Again , the conductor was making a speech , only this time several of the passengers were arguing with him . <p> " Strujcka ! " said one of the passengers . <p> " Rila ! " said the conductor . <p> " Strujcka ! Strujcka ! " said the passenger again . <p> " Vlach ! " said the conductor . " Vlach ! " <p> The conductor raised his fist at that passenger and then began to walk back along the tracks toward the train . He turned one more time , raised his fist again , and shouted , " Vlach ! " <p> In the dim light Peterson had been able to make out that they were all standing on what appeared to be a dirt road crossing the tracks , and that the road disappeared into trees in each direction . The man who had been arguing with the conductor pointed up the dirt road in one direction . <p> Now Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , the one group getting ready to follow the man who had been arguing with the conductor , and the other group getting ready to go the other way on the dirt road . <p> The woodsman came over and picked up Peterson 's suitcase again . <p> " Yudhy scutarja , " he said . <p> " Zog ! " said Peterson . <p> It turned out there were five of them in the woodsman 's group . Peterson walked up at the head of the line , just behind the woodsman , who seemed to carry Peterson 's suitcase with no effort at all . Once or twice Peterson turned around to see what had happened to the other fifteen or so passengers who had gone the other way , but already he could n't see back even as far as the railway tracks . Below them he could now clearly hear the rushing sound of the river . <p> When they came to a bridge that crossed the river , the woodsman put Peterson 's suitcase down and leaned up against the railing . <p> " Yor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woodsman . <p> " Scutarja , " replied the woodsman . <p> Then the woodsman picked up Peterson 's suitcase again , and this time the road headed upwards away from the river . As they walked , its sound grew fainter and fainter , and when Peterson looked up above him he could see that the clouds were thinning and that the moon was trying to break through . He could even see the outlines of mountains back where they had come from . He wondered what the other passengers were doing over there and why they had decided to go towards the mountains . <p> And suddenly remembered the draft of his manuscript . The one he had been reading in the train . The one he had temporarily lost and found again under the seat . Something about missing links . <p> Oh , well , thought Peterson . Too bad . About his leaving that manuscript behind . Not that it was completely lost . Surely it was there in the train . So he could go back to look for it if he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . Not right now . <p> Ahead of him the woodsman swung Peterson 's suitcase around to his other hand . Peterson watched the woodsman as he walked and again wondered how the woodsman could carry the suitcase so easily . He did n't even lean his body to one side as he walked . And they were now walking uphill , after all , and even though Peterson was n't carrying anything , he was beginning to get out of breath . Think of all the weight in that suitcase . <p> Sometimes the moon came out from under the clouds and then went away again . The road twisted ahead of them always going up , and then , after a while , crossed a large field where there were n't any trees at all . <p> Suddenly , without any warning , as it were , all five of them were standing at the edge of a highway . A major highway , as far as Peterson could tell . No dirt road , but wide and paved with a broken yellow line going down its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked up and down the highway . One of the other passengers came over and began to talk to the woodsman , and then the two other passengers came over and began to talk as well . In the tumble of words Peterson heard " Strujcka " repeated again and again . Then one of the men pointed down the highway , and a woman , who Peterson guessed was the man 's wife , started walking in that direction . The man hurried up and joined her . <p> That left three of them , the woodsman , Peterson , and another man . <p> " Taroj , " said the woodsman . <p> He picked up Peterson 's suitcase and started walking up the highway in the opposite direction the man and his wife had gone . Peterson followed right behind the woodsman , and the other man followed along right behind Peterson . <p> Again , Peterson could n't believe how easily the woodsman carried Peterson 's suitcase . Not leaning his body at all . Still , Peterson thought of going up to the woodsman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Peterson , could take over the suitcase and pull it along by its extended handle . On the other hand , he did n't know how he would explain this to the woodsman , and also maybe the wheels of the suitcase had been damaged . <p> So Peterson just kept walking . <p> In theory , he told himself , he should be concerned , perhaps even alarmed , about his present situation . Here he was walking along some highway in the middle of the mountains in a foreign country with two other people whom he did n't know and who could n't speak a word of English . And God knew where they were taking him . Strujcka or where ? <p> But that was in theory . For some reason Peterson was n't alarmed . Not at all . He had the clear feeling that as long as he stayed with the woodsman , as long as he kept walking right behind him , as long as the two of them were together , everything would work out just fine . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in theory , his leaving it in the train should have disturbed him . But , for some reason , it did n't . <p> Ahead of them the surface of the highway reflected the moon 's light and off to one side a valley , or really a canyon , sloped away , and Peterson thought he could still hear the faint sound of the river . Beyond the canyon he could see the hulking shape of mountains . <p> He was n't quite sure how long they had been walking . Every once in a while the woodsman swung Peterson 's suitcase to his other hand . <p> " Cughir , " Peterson heard the woodsman say . <p> Peterson saw it , a little building off to the side of the road . But when they approached it , the woodsman putting down Peterson 's suitcase , Peterson saw it was n't a regular building at all , but some kind of shrine with an open arched roof and the figure of Jesus hanging from the cross , his face turned to one side . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and following his example , Peterson found another log and sat down . But the other man did n't sit down . He went back out to the highway . <p> Peterson looked up at the moon hanging up in the sky , then at the figure of Jesus . Jesus ' whole body pulled against the nails that held him to the cross , but his face , which was turned to the side , expressed no pain . Why ? thought Peterson . Why no pain ? <p> The other man came back from the highway and began to talk to the woodsman . Again Peterson heard the word " Scutarja . " The man shook the woodsman 's hand and then came over and shook Peterson 's hand . <p> " Zog ! " said Peterson . <p> With that , the man went out onto the highway and began to walk back in the direction they had come from . <p> Which left only Peterson and the woodsman . <p> " Taroj , " said the woodsman , getting up . <p> " Taroj , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Peterson 's suitcase and shook his head . He pointed up into the hill on the other side of the highway . <p> Peterson got the idea . They were going up into the hill . His suitcase had to be left here . It could n't go any farther . <p> " Wait , " said Peterson . <p> He went to his suitcase , laid it flat on the ground , and opened the latches , the lip springing up . Surely he ought to take something , he thought . Something . Anything . When he saw the folder containing his draft manuscripts , he thought , I 'll take that , the folder . <p> He pushed at the lid of the suitcase , got the latches locked , and held the folder up to his chest . " Okay , okay ? " he said . <p> " Zog ! " said the woodsman . <p> They started walking along the highway again . At one point Peterson turned around and looked back along the highway , trying to remember this spot . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After about five minutes the woodsman stopped and studied the side of the hill , then pointed , and Peterson could make out the beginnings of a trail going up into the woods . Or thought he could make out the beginnings of a trail . The woodsman stepped across a ditch , grabbed a branch , and lifted himself up . He held out a hand , and Peterson , holding the folder with his manuscripts in one hand , held out his other hand and let the woodsman pull him up . <p> And it certainly was a real trail , because by the moonlight that filtered down between the trees , Peterson could see it extending in front of them . <p> They walked , Peterson right behind the woodsman , until the trail began to switch back and then back again , and back once more , the trail always going up . Although Peterson realized that in ordinary circumstances he ought to have been concerned about leaving his suitcase with all his things in it back down there on the highway beside the shrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally the trail leveled out . <p> " Cughir , " said the woodsman . <p> They had come to another shrine . In fact , it looked almost exactly like the shrine down below alongside the highway , except this one was smaller . But it had the same kind of arched roof and the same figure of Jesus hanging on the cross , his face turned to one side , again showing no pain . <p> The woodsman found a place to sit , this time on a stone . Peterson found a stone to sit on , too , and placed the folder with his manuscripts beside him . He could see the mountains beyond . Quite a beautiful sight , thought Peterson . He must remember this place . Return to it sometime . <p> The woodsman started signaling something to Peterson , holding out the fingers of both hands . He opened and closed his fingers three times . Then the woodsman pulled out his wallet , pointed to it , and opened and closed his hands three times again . Thirty . The woodsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wallet , and the woodsman nodded . <p> So , Peterson thought , he wants thirty euros . In ordinary circumstances Peterson would n't have done this , but he pulled out a twenty and a ten and held them towards the woodsman . The woodsman got up , took them , and stuffed them into the front pocket of his pants . <p> " Brancusi , " said the woodsman , pointing up the trail . <p> Peterson got up to see a man approaching them , walking in long strides . He was tall and thin and carried some kind of walking stick , although it was really too long to be a walking stick . <p> " Shkod ! " said the woodsman , shaking the new man 's hands . <p> " Shkod ! " said the new man . <p> The woodsman reached in his pocket , pulled out the thirty euros , and handed the two bills over to the new man . The new man held them up to the moonlight , then stuffed them in his pants pocket . <p> Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peterson understood that the woodsman was handing him over to the new man and that he , the woodsman , was turning back . <p> " Thanks so very much , " said Peterson to the woodsman . " I ca n't tell you . " <p> The woodsman touched his forehead with his fingers , bowed slightly , and started back down the trail even before Peterson could bow in return . <p> " Taroj ? " said the new man to Peterson . <p> " Taroj , " said Peterson . <p> The new man , probably because he was taller and thinner , walked faster than the woodsman , pumping the stick beside him . At first , as the trail went uphill , it was hard for Peterson to keep up . Several times the man in front of him stopped and waited for Peterson . <p> " Plov ? " asked the man the second time he stopped . <p> They had just started walking again when Peterson remembered his manuscript folder . Gone . Not in his one hand and not in the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . He remembered putting it down beside him when he sat down on the rock at the last stop . After the woodsman had sat down on his rock . So the folder must still be there . Beside the rock . <p> But he was n't going back for it . Maybe tomorrow , thought Peterson . When he came back for his suitcase . Then he could also come up the trail and get his folder . See that beautiful view again . <p> " Cughir , " said the man . <p> Peterson looked ahead and saw another shrine . Only this one was n't a building at all but a long wooden carving fixed against a tree . Again it displayed the body of Christ nailed to the cross , his head hanging to his side . <p> Peterson 's new guide started opening and closing his hands five times . <p> This time Peterson understood immediately . He pulled out his wallet , looked inside , and saw in the moonlight that he only had one bill left , and that it was a fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man leaned his stick up against the tree next to the shrine and held the bill up to the moonlight . Then he pulled the other euro bills out of his pants pocket , put the fifty with them , and shoved them back . <p> " Brancusi , " said the man , looking along the trail . <p> Peterson looked , too , and was n't all that surprised to see still another man approach . Unlike his current guide , this man walked slowly , even dragging one of his feet a little , causing his head to bob . As he got closer , Peterson could see why he walked so slowly . He was very old . He also carried a stick , and Peterson could see that it was a real walking stick and he leaned on it as he walked . <p> And suddenly Peterson understood-and this did n't totally surprise him , either-that he knew this man , that he had seen him before : the train master at the station where Peterson had started his trip today . The man even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his ears stood out away from his head in the same way . Of course , he was n't dressed in that uniform with all the braids and stripes . Rather , he wore an old suit coat and vest , a peaked cap , and rubber boots that almost went up to his knees . <p> " Shkod ! " said the tall , thin man to the old man . <p> " Shkod ! " rasped the old man . <p> The thin man reached in his trousers pocket and brought out the euro bills , all eighty euros ' worth of them , as far as Peterson could tell , and handed them over to the old man . The old man passed the bills into a pocket of his vest without even looking at them . <p> " Beyzo , " rasped the old man and looked at Peterson . " Taroj ? " <p> " Taroj , " said Peterson . <p> It was easy to follow the old man since he walked so slowly . Peterson even had plenty of time to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking across an open field . The moon lit up everything , giving the grass around them a kind of silvery glow . A number of times Peterson looked over at the hulk of the mountains behind them and wondered what had happened to the group of train passengers who had gone that way . He was certainly glad he was n't with them . <p> After a while the trail started downhill and then went into the woods . But it was n't completely dark in the woods because the moonlight still filtered through the tops of the trees . <p> Suddenly , without any warning , as it were , the trail broke out into a clearing , and down below in the valley , a surprise : a walled town with turrets . Peterson could even make out the moat around the wall and the bridge over the moat to the towered gate . In the center of the town , of course , the church . It was lit up with floodlights , its steeple going up into the sky . And , or was he imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia Brown " drifting up from below ? A Dixieland band ? <p> " Chinko , " rasped the old man . <p> " What ? " <p> " Zog . Chinko . " <p> " Chinko ! " said Peterson . <p> And now no doubt about it . Down there , somewhere in that town , probably next to the church , a Dixieland band was ratcheting up " Sweet Georgia Brown . " <p> The old man lifted his fingers to the peak of his cap and made a slight bow . " Tarog , " he said . <p> " Tarog , " answered Peterson , returning the bow . <p> The old man started back up the trail , dragging the one foot behind him . Just as he was about to reenter the woods , Peterson called out , " California ! " <p> The old man stopped and held up his stick . <p> Then he went into the woods . <p> And then Peterson was alone . But that was all right . Being alone . Because he saw the trail . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cross the bridge . Enter the gate . Go to where he had always wanted to go . <p>
