The guard peers into the open car window . " Where are you from ? " he says . // I 've been in Afghanistan for five hours . Five hours total , ever . Until I crossed the border this morning , I had never been inside the country in my entire seventeen years of life . In my pocket is a blue passport stamped United States of America , issued just months ago by the agency in San Francisco , a forty-five-minute commuter-train ride from my home . I know what I should tell the guard . But instead I say the name of the Afghan province my family 's from-where I feel like I 'm from , where I want to be from . " Kunar , " I reply . // " Pull over , " the guard says . // The taxi I 'm riding in-a ' 99 Toyota Corolla decorated with fuzzy dice and pictures of Indian actresses-pulls to the side of this checkpoint on the outskirts of Kabul . The guard strides over and says-in Dari , the Afghan language we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I unlock my bags for him , and he sifts through my clothes . When he checks my passport , he says derisively , " Oh , you must be one of those Afghan-Americans , huh ? " // " Yeah , " I say , trying not to get ruffled . " I 'm coming back to see my country . " // Then the guard opens a small bag in which I 've packed some U2 CDs . Okay , a lot of U2 CDs-more than eighty . I 'm going to be in Afghanistan for the whole summer , and I want at least one form of entertainment . I 'm carrying all ten of their studio albums , their singles and B-sides , bootlegs of concerts . // " What 's all this ? " the guard says . " What if this is bad stuff ? We should test this , " he announces . Now he 's really just posturing ; there 's no stereo equipment in sight . // When at last we 're allowed to pass , our driver starts cussing the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says angrily . " It 's just because you said you 're from Kunar . " Being from Kunar means I 'm an ethnic Pashtun ; the guard was an ethnic Tajik . As we approach Kabul-where I 'll meet up with my father-the driver continues his screed . Little does he know I could give him a lecture of my own . For months I 've been reading at the pace of a Ph.D . student about Afghanistan . But this is the first time I 've been directly affected by ethnic tension , and foreknowledge or not , the actual experience feels weird . // The whole day has felt weird . I did n't expect to be transformed the moment I touched Afghan soil ( or did I ? ... ) ; but I thought I could reasonably expect to feel some connection to the place . Instead I 'm carsick , dust-choked , and shocked by the barren landscape ; I feel no affinity with the bearded men and shrouded women in our path . The only thing that 's clear to me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be like this . // What was it supposed to be like ? I do n't know . During all the months I 've spent dreaming of Afghanistan , I 've never been able to put into words what I wanted to feel when I finally went inside . A rush of excitement was the best I could do . It was easier to picture actual things that might happen later , scenes here and there : walking along a street in Kabul with my father , meeting Karzai in the presidential palace , driving through mountains in an SUV actually necessitated by the terrain . A lot of kids my age dream of playing football with the pros , or making the last shot to win the basketball game . I dream of going to Kunar and helping my dad land a big UN reconstruction project . That 's the kind of stuff I 've been thinking about all spring ; it 's what goes through my mind when I 'm lifting weights or running on the treadmill in my garage . // For years Afghanistan has existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , and I would learn about it and read about it , but it was a story ; it was n't real . Not long after 9/11 I bid on eBay for a National Geographic that featured an article called " Afghanistan : Crossroad of Conquerors . " The issue was from September 1968-a time in Afghanistan that now seems like paradise . Radical political movements had yet to gain significant momentum . There were universities in Kabul , moderate social mores , and European college students traipsing through as they wound their way to Kathmandu along the " Hippie Trail . " There were archaeologists digging for Paleolithic tools instead of dogs sniffing for landmines ; farmers tending wheat instead of poppies in the agricultural countryside . These were the days in which my parents met in Kabul and married . My mom can go on for hours . // I won the auction for the National Geographic , and when it came , I paged through it . A photograph of the Kabul stadium later notorious as a site of the Taliban 's public executions offered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerily festooned as if for the Rose Bowl . Another picture showed a woman with makeup and a stylish haircut . But my favorite photograph in the issue showed a countryside landscape that seemed not to have changed for four hundred years . A man herded cattle along a path . In the background there were desertlike hills , but also green grass , and a rushing blue river . In the middle of the river was a rock with a house set on it . I 'd stare at the picture , wondering how the person who lived in the house on the rock got home across the water . // My house in California is on a cul-de-sac , and I get there the regular way teenagers in California do , whipping around the corner , playing music loud in the car . I usually park on the street , because our garage is filled with gym equipment and extra kitchen stuff for my mom-a second freezer full of meat , sacks of rice so big I 'm the only one who can carry them inside . We live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall with the house next door . I 'll come in and sit down in the living room . Sometimes my sister-in-law Sofia will be over , playing with my little nephew , Ali , who 's one . Ali will take a Tootsie Roll from the bowl on the coffee table and try to eat the wrapper as well as the candy ; Sofia will reach inside his mouth and pull the wet paper out . Sofia and Ali and my brother Omar , a mortgage broker , live nearby . ( I also have two sisters : Mariam , who 's twenty-nine , and Zulikha , who 's twenty-five . ) Omar 's thirty-one , fourteen years older than I am , and I 've really looked up to him . Sofia says that when I was about eight years old , I would follow Omar everywhere-even to the bathroom , where I 'd stand outside the door and wait for him to come out . // Omar 's one of those people everyone looks up to . On his very first day at an American high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the message " Call me " under the windshield wiper of his car . " This girl left me a note . What should I do ? " Omar asked my dad . " Come back to Afghanistan over summer break , " my father responded immediately . ( It was more of an order than a suggestion. ) // As a teenager , Omar sometimes traveled in Afghanistan with my father ; one summer they went along with some rebel troops my father financed . We have a home video with footage of this trip and others . The beginning of the video is messed up-someone accidentally taped part of an episode of Chicago Hope over it . When the action begins , you see a line of mujahedeen-holy warriors-hiking up a mountain trail ; Omar marches behind my father , grinning at the camera . His pakol is pulled over his eyes at a purposely odd angle , like a kid with his baseball hat on weird . When the mujahedeen come to a stop and launch rockets at the Russians , the sound explodes into our living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their targets . In another scene men nibble at hunks of snow they cup in their hands . They ate a lot of snow , Omar says ; it was a condiment for biscuits . Sometimes they 'd be sitting there eating , and Russian helicopters would buzz overhead and everyone would drop his biscuit and just start running . // To regroup , they all might stop at a cave . " Like a regular room , " Omar says , " but a room in a mountain . " When you slice open some rocks , you find crystals inside ; if you cut away these outcroppings , you 'd find generators , refrigerators , and microwaves . One day Omar visited a cave in the province of Paktia outfitted with a sofa , maps for strategizing attacks , and flowered teacups. // That same day , Omar tells me , the mujahedeen captured a major Communist post . Their commander was Jallaluddin Haqqani , who was then a close friend of my father 's , and had invited him along on this trip . ( Haqqani now appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Americans ' most-wanted list. ) // The Communists captured that day were to be killed on the spot . At the time my father was reporting for Voice of America , and he had a tape recorder with him . Before the prisoners were killed , they were brought to my father to be interviewed . He asked them a couple of basic questions like " Why do you fight against the mujahedeen ? " // The prisoners trembled . They said , " Could you please turn your recorder off ? I just want to tell you something personally . " // " I 'm innocent , " they said , the minute the tape recorder was off , the words tumbling out of their mouths . " I 'm not guilty . So if they kill me , you 're going to become guilty . " // " I 've never seen human beings like that , " Omar told me . " In their eyes they were almost already dead . " // Before the mujahedeen killed the prisoners , they gave them a banana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers took them behind a rock . Then they shot them . // Haqqani tossed a gun to Omar . " Here , " he said . " You want to kill one ? " It was a hospitable gesture , like offering a guest tea and snacks at your house . // " No , " Omar said . // " They are going to get killed anyway , " Haqqani said . // Omar understood ; he just did n't want to do it . Though he had a personal stake in the conflict-he 'd grown up in Afghanistan , been uprooted by the war-it was n't the same for him as it was for the mujahedeen , who had been fighting for years and had lost brothers , fathers , and families . As certain as Omar was that he did n't want to kill a Communist , they were certain that they did . // Conservative estimates of the Afghan death toll during the Soviet war hover around one million , but the figure is probably much closer to two million . During those years , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 million ) fled the country ; at one point half of all refugees in the world were Afghans . My family and I were among them . // My parents settled in Peshawar , Pakistan , not long after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on December 27 , 1979 . Among the Russian troops ' targets that night was Kabul Radio , which was run by the government and was headed by my dad . Now , whenever I go to a bookstore , the first thing I do with any new book they have about Afghanistan is turn to the index and look up Kabul Radio . The books describe that first night and the ten-year war that followed . Peshawar became a sort of staging ground for the resistance , a place where people came and checked in and then went back into the country to fight . A baby photograph of me dressed up as a mujahed-a rocket launcher positioned behind me in our living room-embodies the spirit of the times . // Of course , I remember nothing of Peshawar ; I left for America in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine had been kidnapped , and though he was safely returned , my brother and I were at risk ; the abductors had been after us . My mother wanted to get us out . Leaving my father behind to continue his work , we flew to the United States and moved into an apartment near relatives in Alexandria , Virginia . Many Afghan refugees lived near San Francisco , and we soon moved to the Bay Area , too . // My father came to visit when he could . I did n't like to be alone with him ; he was unfamiliar to me . My mother and father both speak the Afghan language Pashto , but they grew up in different provinces , and there are regional variations . On one visit-I must have been about three-my father asked me to close the door . I was confused ; I did n't understand the word he 'd used for door . " Close the door , " he said again . Then he thought I was ignoring him , and he got a little mad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my mother , crying . // Back in Peshawar , one of my father 's closest friends was a famous mujahedeen commander named Abdul Haq . After Kabul Radio , the next thing I look up in any book about Afghanistan is Abdul Haq . If it means anything to say you have a hero , mine would be Abdul Haq . Most of the mujahedeen commanders were n't able to explain their struggle to the world . They were fighters , not great communicators . But Abdul Haq was a visionary . He understood both Islam and the West and saw how they could exist together . He met with President Ronald Reagan at the White House and with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London . His intelligence was equaled by his bravery . One night during the war he stumbled into a landmine . Hours later , with a knife and without any anesthetic , a doctor amputated Abdul Haq 's foot . ( Now , many years after the Soviet war , Afghanistan is still one of the world 's most heavily landmined countries. ) // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the next few years a Communist government still controlled the country . Then the Soviet Union collapsed , and the Communist regime in Kabul finally crumbled . My father assumed a diplomatic position in the new mujahedeen-led government . He was posted to the Afghan embassy in India and asked us to join him there . It all happened in a span of just weeks . " Sell everything , " my mother told my aunt , giving her the keys to our apartment . But in Delhi we monitored the nightly radio broadcasts from Afghanistan with increasing despair . The Communists were gone , but now the mujahedeen were ruining everything by fighting among themselves . My father observed as much on his trips to Kabul : civil war was raging , and the prospects for a resolution were bleak . // When the Taliban emerged , my father sent us back to the United States . My mother and I returned to California and moved in with my grandmother . She lived in a home for the elderly , and we all shared a single room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good memories of that place . I was having a hard time in general . My cousin Yossef , who 'd been my best friend when I left , seemed a lot different from me . He-and everyone else-now listened to this new thing called rap music . In school the teacher asked me to read aloud , and I embarrassed myself by standing up to do so , as was the custom in India . But I was so young that it was easy to adjust . Soon I was playing football , renting video games at Blockbuster , and trying out snowboarding in Lake Tahoe. // Meanwhile the Taliban were taking over Afghanistan . Though they at first seemed like a collection of upright religious students determined to restore order , their repressive ideology soon revealed itself . ( So did the extent of their financial and military support from Pakistan , a country that has long been working against Afghanistan 's best interests . ) In this political climate , my father 's life was at risk , and in 1996 he , like many of his peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Afghanistan had , at least temporarily , reached a dead end . My father joined us in the Bay Area , and this time he was here to stay . // We moved into our house in Concord , a typical suburb with a Starbucks , a Safeway , and a Barnes &amp; Noble . By the standards of the Afghan community here , my family is moderate-politically , religiously , socially . ( For example , the women in our family do not cover their hair , but if I had a girlfriend , I would n't be able to talk about it . ) At home our family speaks Pashto . My mother knows little English ; my father taught himself during his years in Peshawar , and though he has a good grasp of the language , he underestimates his competence in it , often deferring to me to help him find the right word . ( Though usually he will ignore my suggestion , or get impatient waiting for it , and decide to speak up himself. ) // One day in the summer of 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some live U2 concert tapes on eBay , when I heard my father calling me. // " Hyder ! " he yelled . " Stop playing at the computer . Come downstairs . " // Since it was my father , I hurried , running down to the living room . There was my father . And there was Abdul Haq. // I do n't know how else to put it : literally , my jaw dropped . " Salaam alaikum , " I said . Peace be with you . // " Salaam alaikum , " Abdul Haq replied . He came forward and gave me the traditional Afghan greeting : a hug , a kiss on one cheek , then the other . //
