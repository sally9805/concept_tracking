The Scent of Scandal Chapter One ANISE A pale yellow oil with a sweet spicy fragrance reminiscent of liquorice . In large doses it has a narcotic effect . It should be used with extreme caution and in moderation only . Anise is good for aches and pains , particularly in the neck . The Complete Encyclopaedia of Aromatherapy Oils by Jessamine Lovage " She 's had men popping in and out of there all day , " Anise said over her shoulder . " They 're more regular than our cuckoo clock . " There was a sharp edge to the winter morning , complementing perfectly the tone in Anise 's voice . Outside , cobwebs , rigid with frost , hung along the hedge like starched doilies bereft of fairy cakes , flung there with careless abandon after some wild tea party . The chill sun bounced off the ice crystals and glinted in her face , making it difficult to see . In her sitting room , Anise squinted and lifted the binoculars up to her eyes , her reading glasses clinking as they knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aching already . She watched the postman puffing up the hill , his breath making more steam than an old railway engine . Shifting her position , she took her weight on her good leg and looked through the binoculars toward the house across the road , whizzing them fuzzily across the barrier of hedges and spindly skeletal trees before focusing on the front door of number five Lavender Hill . " Nine-fifteen . " She glared at her younger sister who was reclining in an armchair , apparently staring into space . " Write it down ! " Angelica sighed and picked up her notepad . " First one of the day . Tall . Caucasian . Male , " Anise barked . Angelica paused with her pencil . She looked up at her sister . " What does Caucasian mean ? " Anise turned and glared at her . " White , Angelica . White . Tall , white male . Do n't you ever watch NYPD Blue or Hill Street Blues ? " " No . " Angelica shrugged and her face took on a ponderous look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you spell Caucasian ? " " Just put white , " Anise snapped , returning to her binoculars . " Just put white . " She balanced the binoculars on her hip and wished fervently that the pins and needles would go out of her hands . It would hardly be appropriate to rub them in front of Angelica and lose face . " What about Mr. Patel , who runs the post office and general store , is he Caucasian ? " " No . He 's Asian . " " What does the Cauc bit mean ? " Her sister put her pencil in her mouth and chewed the end of it thoughtfully . Anise glared at her again . " Are you deliberately being obtuse , Angelica ? " " No . And Mr. Patel 's a very nice man . You should get to know him better . He always helps to tear the page out of my pension book . They do n't make perforations like they used to . " Anise tutted . " Let 's get on with it , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She raised the binoculars again . " Tall , white male . Light-gray pinstripe suit . White shirt . Not tailored . Loud , flashy tie . Too vulgar by half . " " Is it absolutely necessary to write down what he 's wearing ? " Anise turned to glare at her sister for a third time . " How will we know if he comes out wearing the same clothes ? " Angelica sat back in the armchair and languorously crossed her legs . " How will we know if he comes out at all unless you 're planning to keep watch all day ? " " I thought I 'd draw up a rota . " " Oh no , Anise . " Angelica waved her hand emphatically . " You can count me out of that one . If you want to do this , you can do it by yourself . I do n't mind taking a few notes , but you 're not getting me up there doing your dirty work . You know I do n't like heights . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not asking you to scale the Eiffel Tower . Besides the reputation of Great Brayford is at stake . " She craned forward with her binoculars . " He looks suspiciously like Regis Philbin . " She turned and snapped at her sister 's inertia . " Quick , quickwrite it down . Write it down ! " Angelica brushed her hair from her forehead with a languid movement . She had seen the young Grace Kelly do it years ago in Dial M for Murder and it was an affectation she had practiced ever since . After all these years she had it down to a fine art . Not that anyone ever appreciated it . It drove Anise insane . Partly because it drew attention to the fact that her hair was still generously flecked with soft honey tones rather than the harsh ice-gray that Anise 's had gone just after she turned sixty . Her sister had looked remarkably like Catherine Deneuve until then everyone used to say so . Fifteen years later , Anise 's skin was also gray but she hid it skillfully with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer made the Deneuve comparison . Her seventies had turned Anise old , cold and as hard as a boiled sweet . " You could be a bit more specific , Anise . You have n't said how old he is . " " It 's hard to tell . He 's looking shifty , moving his head from side to side . Bugger . This hedge is in the way ; we 'll have to get Basil to lop the top off again . " " I think he 's getting too old for it . " A look of concern crossed Angelica 's face . " Perhaps we need to get someone else in . " " We 're getting too old for it , that 's why we pay the lazy blighter to do it for us . Although the only thing I ever see him doing is leaning on his blasted spade , watching the grass grow . I 've seen garden gnomes more animated than Basil . "                   @ @
