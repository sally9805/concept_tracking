No one would have guessed from the way Lady Fran-cesca Haughston moved through the Whittington ballroom that she was making the opening moves of her campaign . She strolled along in her usual manner , pausing to compliment a dress here or flirt with one of her many admirers there . She smiled and talked and plied her fan deftly , a vision in ice-blue silk , her blond hair falling in a cascade of curls from an upswept knot . But all the while , her dark blue eyes were looking for her prey . <p> It had been almost a month since she had vowed to herself to find a wife for the Duke of Rochford , and tonight she intended to set her plan in motion . She had made all her preparations . She had studied the young unmarried women of the ton , and through careful research and observation , she had managed to whittle the number down to just three whom she felt suitable for Sinclair . <p> All three of the young ladies would be here this evening , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Season , and , short of dire illness , any marriageable young lady would attend . Moreover , the odds were that the duke would be there , as well , which meant that Francesca could set her scheme in motion . It was time she began , she knew  --  past time . She had not really needed three weeks to sort out the possible brides for Rochford . There was only a rather small number of girls who could qualify to become his duchess . <p> But for some reason , ever since Callie 's wedding , Francesca had been beset by ennui , curiously reluctant to pay calls or attend parties or the theater . Even her good friend Sir Lucien had commented on her sudden preference for staying at home . She was not sure of the reason for it ; everything just suddenly seemed dull and scarcely worth the effort . She had felt , in fact , a trifle blue-deviled  --  a result , she had decided , of the fact that Callie , who had been living with Francesca while they sorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . Without Callie 's cheerful voice and fetching smile , Francesca 's house was too empty . <p> Still , she reminded herself , she had vowed to make up for the wrong she had done to Callie 's brother , Sinclair , fifteen long years ago . It was impossible to right matters , of course , but she could at least do the duke the favor of finding him a suitable bride . It was , after all , the thing at which she was most skilled . So she had come to this party tonight determined to begin the long dance of courtship on his behalf . <p> She strolled along the perimeter of the grand ballroom , a huge affair painted all in white and gold , floored with oak planks the color of honey , and lit by three glittering cascades of crystal chandeliers . Several gold stands of thick white beeswax candles provided more light , as did the gold-and-white sconces along the walls . All this brilliance was softened by the huge bouquets of crimson roses and peonies standing in vases against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnificent staircase to the second floor . It was an elegant room , worthy of a palace , and it was rumored that only the formal ballroom made Lady Whittington willing to remain in this enormous and antiquated old mansion situated unfashionably outside Mayfair . <p> Francesca threaded through the crowd to the staircase , intending to use the vantage point of the second-floor railing to locate the young women she was seeking in the massive ballroom below . It was fitting , she thought , as she began to climb the curving stairs , that she should begin her campaign at the Whittingtons ' ball . It had been here , after all , that she had ended things with the Duke of Rochford fifteen years ago . It had been here that her world had come crashing down . <p> The flowers had all been white that night , she remembered , masses of roses , peonies , camellias and sweet-scented gardenias , accented by glossy greenery trailing from the high vases . It had been a night of heady triumph for Francesca  --  she had made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauty of the Season . Men had flocked around her , flirting and begging for a dance , making extravagant declarations of love and paying flowery compliments . And all the while she had hugged her secret to herself , giddy with love and excitement  --  until the footman had slipped a note into her hand . <p> Now Francesca reached the second floor and took her place at the railing , where she could gaze down at the swirling dancers below . Things were much the same , she thought , as they had been that night so long ago . The dresses had been different , of course , the colors of the walls and the decorations changed . But the glamour , the excitement , the hopes and intrigues , had not altered . Francesca gazed out at the crowd without really seeing them , remembering instead the past . <p> " Is the party so grim ? " a light , familiar voice said at her side . <p> Francesca turned and smiled at the blond woman . " Irene . How good to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , curling blond hair and unusual golden eyes . At twenty-seven years old , she had been a spinster  --  and determined to remain one  --  until last autumn , when Francesca , searching for a suitable spouse for the Earl of Radbourne , had realized that Irene was the perfect match for him . The two women had spent their lives in much the same circle , so she had known the blunt , opinionated Lady Irene for years , but the two of them had not been friends until they had spent two weeks together at the Radbourne estate as Francesca sought to match the rough Lord Gideon to a well-bred wife . Now Francesca counted Irene as one of her closest friends . <p> Irene looked out over the multicolored crowd of dancers . " Is the new crop of marriageable young ladies so dismal ? " <p> Francesca shrugged . Though she and Irene had maintained a genteel silence regarding the matter , Francesca suspected Irene had guessed that her matchmaking efforts were more a question of survival than amusement . <p> " Indeed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quite lazy since Callie 's wedding , I fear . " <p> Irene regarded her shrewdly . " You are distressed , are you not ? Is there aught that I can do ? " <p> Francesca shook her head . " ' T is nothing , really . I am just rememberinga time long past . Another party here . " She forced a smile , the charming dimple in her cheek appearing . " Where is Lord Gideon ? " <p> In the six months the couple had been married , it was rare to see Irene without Gideon by her side . The pair had suited each other even better than Francesca had guessed ; it seemed as if their love grew with each passing day . <p> Irene let out a little giggle . " He was waylaid by his great-aunt as we came in . " <p> " Lady Odelia ? " Francesca asked , appalled . " Good Gad , is she here ? " She glanced around apprehensively . <p> " We are safe here , " Irene assured her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why I fled to the balcony as soon as I stepped out of the cloakroom and saw that she had cornered Gideon . " <p> " And left him there ? " Francesca asked , chuckling . " For shame , Lady Radbourne . What about your vows ? " <p> " My wedding vows made no mention of Great-Aunt Odelia , I assure you , " Irene retorted , grinning . " I did feel a twinge of guilt , but I reminded myself that Gideon is a strong man , feared by many . " <p> " Even the bravest quail before Lady Odelia , however . I remember once when Rochford himself sneaked out the back door and went ' round to the stables when he saw her carriage out front , leaving my mother and me with his grandmother to face her . " <p> Irene let out a burst of laughter . " I should like to have seen that . I shall have to tease him about that the next time we meet . " <p> " How is the duke ? " Francesca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen him lately ? " <p> Irene glanced at her . " A week or so ago . We went to the theater together . He and Gideon are now friends , as well as cousins . But surely you have seen Rochford , as well . " <p> Francesca shrugged . " Only rarely since Callie 's wedding . It was his sister who was my friend , really , not Rochford . " <p> The truth was that Francesca had been avoiding the duke since his sister 's wedding . The guilty knowledge of how she had wronged him had weighed on her , and every time she had run into him , she had been pierced with guilt anew . She knew that she should tell him what she had found out , that she should apologize for her actions . It was craven of her not to . <p> Yet she could not do it ; her insides chilled whenever she thought of confessing and begging his pardon . They had at least achieved a kind of peace with each other after all these years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if she told him and it brought back his anger ? She deserved that anger , she supposed , but her stomach twisted at the idea . So she had taken to avoiding Rochford whenever possible , staying away from a party if she thought he would attend it , and when she did see him , taking care not to go near him . If they came face-to-face , as had happened once or twice , she had been stiff and awkward , escaping as soon as possible . <p> Of course , that must end if she was to have any success finding a wife for the man . She could scarcely bring him together with one of his prospective brides if she continued to avoid him . <p> " Callie told me that Rochford had been unfair to you , " Irene began carefully . <p> " Unfair ? " Francesca glanced at her , startled . " No . How was he unfair ? " <p> " I know not , " Irene admitted . " Something to do with Lord Bromwell courting Callie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francesca dismissed the idea with a flick of her hand . " The duke had reason to be concerned . Brom 's sister had certainly poisoned him against Rochford , but " She shrugged expressively . " There was little I could do once they fell in love , in any case , and Rochford realized it afterwards . I am not so tender a female as to wither under a rebuke . " <p> Francesca glanced out again over the crowd , and Irene followed her gaze . <p> " Who do you seek ? " Irene asked after a moment . <p> " What ? Oh . No one . " <p> Irene 's eyebrows lifted . " You are most diligent in looking for no one . " <p> Francesca had difficulty dissembling with Irene . Something about Irene 's forthright manner seemed to call forth an equal candor in her . She hesitated now , then admitted , " I was hoping to see Lady Althea Robart . " <p> " Althea ? " Irene repeated in surprise . " Whatever for ? " <p> Francesca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ? " <p> Irene shrugged . " Dislike is too strong a word . She simply is not company I would choose to keep . Too high in the instep for me . " <p> Francesca nodded . The lady did seem a bit stiff . But she was not sure that pride would necessarily be a detriment to a future duchess . " I do not know her well . " <p> " Nor I , " Irene agreed . <p> " What about Damaris Burke ? " <p> " The daughter of Lord Burke ? " Irene asked . " The diplomat ? " <p> Francesca nodded . " Exactly . " <p> Irene thought for a moment , then shrugged . " I can not say , really . I have never moved in government circles . " <p> " She seems quite pleasant . " <p> " Smooth , " Irene agreed . " What one would expect , I suppose , from a woman who holds diplomatic parties . " She glanced at her friend curiously . " Why are you asking ? Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . " <p> " No , " Francesca told her quickly . " They have not . I was just considering them . " <p> " Ah , then it is a gentleman who has sought your help ? " Irene guessed . <p> " Not really . I have been thinking . On my own , as it were . " <p> " Now you have completely aroused my curiosity . You are matchmaking for someone who has not even asked you ? Is this another wager with the duke ? " <p> Francesca blushed . " Oh . No , nothing like that . I had thought  --  well , there was someone I wronged once , and I had been looking to make it up to him . " <p> " By finding him a wife ? " Irene asked . " There are a number of men who would not thank you for that favor . Who is the man ? " <p> Francesca studied the woman next to her . Of all her friends , Irene knew the most about her . Though Francesca had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father had been a friend of Francesca 's late husband , so no doubt Irene suspected how little happiness Francesca had found in her marriage , and Fran-cesca had never felt it necessary to maintain a pretense to Irene that she had missed Andrew in the five years since his death . She had never told anyone about what had happened between her and Rochford so long ago , but she suddenly found herself wanting to confide in Irene . <p> " Is he the reason for your melancholy ? " Irene persisted . <p> " I think that is caused by the rapid approach of my birthday , " Francesca replied lightly , but then she sighed and said , " And a little by having hurt him when he did not deserve it . I am very sorry for what I did . " <p> Irene frowned . " I can not imagine that you could have done anything so terrible . " <p> " I think he might differ with you , " Francesca responded . She looked into her friend 's eyes , warm with sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Gideon , for he knows the man . " <p> Irene 's brows went up , and Francesca saw understanding dawn in the other woman 's clear golden eyes . " The duke ? You are talking about Rochford ? " <p> Francesca sighed . " I should have known that you would guess . Yes , it is Rochford , but you must promise me that you will not tell anyone . " <br> Continues ...
