New thinking about the newborn brain , feelings and behavior are changing the way we look at parenting Photograph // Bookstore shelves are crammed with titles purporting to help you make your baby smarter , happier , healthier , stronger , better-behaved and everything else you can imagine , in what I call a shopping-cart approach to infant development . But experts are now beginning to look more broadly , in an integrated fashion , at the first few months of a baby 's life . And so should you . Psychological theorists are moving away from focusing on single areas such as physical development , genetic inheritance , cognitive skills or emotional attachment , which give at best a limited view of how babies develop . Instead , they are attempting to synthesize and integrate all the separate pieces of the infant-development puzzle . The results so far have been enlightening , and are beginning to suggest new ways of parenting . Photograph Photograph // The most important of the emerging revelations is that the key to stimulating emotional and intellectual growth in your child is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how you scold , how you reward and how you show affection . If the baby 's brain is the hardware , then you , the parents , provide the software . When you understand the hardware ( your baby 's brain ) , you will be better able to design the software ( your own behavior ) to promote baby 's well-being . The first two years of life are critical in this regard because that 's when your baby is building the mental foundation that will dictate his or her behavior through adulthood . In the first year alone , your baby 's brain grows from about 400g to a stupendous 10008 . While this growth and development is in part predetermined by genetic force , exactly how the brain grows is dependent upon emotional interaction , and that involves you . " The human cerebral cortex adds about 70% of its final DNA content after birth , " reports Allan N. Schore , Ph.D. , assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA Medical School , " and this expanding brain is directly influenced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide this enrichment during the first two years can lead to a lifetime of emotional disability , according to attachment theorists . We are talking about the need to create a relationship and environment that allows your child to grow up with an openness to learning and the ability to process , understand and experience emotion with compassion , intelligence and resilience . These are the basic building blocks of emotional success . Following are comparisons of researchers ' " old thinking " and " new thinking . " They highlight the four new insights changing the way we view infant development . The sections on " What To Do " then explain how to apply that new information . 1 . FEELINGS TRUMP THOUGHTS It is the emotional quality of the relationship you have with your - baby that will stimulate his or her brain for optimum emotional and intellectual growth . OLD THINKING : In this country , far too much emphasis is placed on developing babies ' cognitive abilities . Some of this push came out of the promising results of the Head Start program . Middle-class families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment is beneficial , would n't " more " be better ? And the race to create the " superbaby " was on . Gone are the days when parents just wished their child were " normal " and could " fit in " with other kids . Competition for selective schools and the social pressure it generates has made parents feel their child needs to be " gifted . " Learning exercises , videos and educational toys are pushed on parents to use in play with their children . " Make it fim , " the experts say The emphasis is on developing baby 's cognitive skills by using the emotional reward of parental attention as a behavior-training tool . THE NEW THINKING : Flying in the face of all those " smarter " baby books are studies suggesting that pushing baby to learn words , numbers , colors and shapes too early forces the child to use lower-level thinking processes , rather than develop his or her learning ability . It 's Nice a pony trick at the circus : When the pony paws the ground to " count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's simply performing a stunt . Such " tricks " are not only not helpful to baby 's learning process , they are potentially harmful . Tufts University child psychologist David Elland , Ph.D. , makes it clear that putting pressure on a child to learn information sends the message that he or she needs to " perform " to gain the parents " acceptance , and it can dampen natural curiosity . Instead , focus on building baby 's emotional skills . " Emotional development is not just the foundation for important capacities such as intimacy and trust , " says Stanley Greenspan , M.D. , clinical professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at George Washington University Medical School and author of the new comprehensive book Building Healthy Minds . " It is also the foundation of intelligence and a wide variety of cognitive skills . At each stage of development , emotions lead the way , and learning facts and skills follow . Even math skills , which appear to be strictly an impersonal cognition , are initially learned through the emotions : A lot ' to a 2-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas a little ' is less than he wants . " It makes sense : Consider how well you learn when you are passionate about a subjest , compared to when you are simply required to learn it . That passion is the emotional fuel driving the cognitive process . So the question then becomes not " what toys and games should I use to make my baby smarter ? " but " how should I interact with my baby to make him passionate ' about the world around him ? " WHAT TO DO : When you read the baby " milestone " books or cognitive development guides , keep in mind that the central issue is your baby 's emotional development . As Greenspan advises , " Synthesize this information about milestones and see them with emotional development as the central issue . This is like a basketball team , with the coach being our old friend , emotions . Because emotions tell the child what he wants to do-move his arm , make a sound , smile or frown . As you look at the various milestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how the whole mental team is working together . " Not only will this give you more concrete clues as to how to strengthen your emotional relationship , but it will also serve to alert you to any " players " on the team that are weak or injured , i.e. , a muscle problem in the legs , or a sight and hearing difficulty . 2 . NOT JUST A SCREAMING MEATLOAF : BIRTH TO TWO MONTHS . Its still largely unknown how well infants understand their world at birth , but new theories are challenging the traditional perspectives . OLD THINKING : Until now , development experts thought infants occupied some kind of presocial , precognitive , preorganized life phase that stretched from birth to two months . They viewed newborns ' needs as mainly physiological with sleepwake , day-night and hunger-satiation cycles , even calling the first month of life " the normal autism " phase , or as a friend calls it , the " screaming meatloaf " phase . Certainly , the newborn has emotional needs , but researchers thought they were only in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE NEW THINKING : In his revolutionary book , The Interpersonal World of the Infant , psychiatrist Daniel Stem , Ph.D. , challenged the conventional wisdom on infant development by proposing that babies come into this world as social beings . In research experiments , newborns consistently demonstrate that they actively seek sensory stimulation , have distinct preferences and , from birth , tend to form hypotheses about what is occurring in the world around them . Their preferences are emotional ones . In fact , parents would be unable to establish the physiological cycles like wake-sleep without the aid of such sensory , emotional activities as rocking , touching , soothing , taking and singing . In turn , these interactions stimulate the child 's brain to make the neuronal connections she needs in order to process the sensory information provided . WHAT TO DO : " Take note of your baby 's own special biological makeup and interactive style , " Greenspan advises . You need to see your baby for the special individual he is at birth . Then , " you can deliberately introduce the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimizes his frustrations . " This is also the time to learn how to help your baby regulate his emotions , for example , by of fering an emotionally overloaded baby some soothing sounds or rocking to help him calm down . Photograph // 3 . THE LOVE LOOP : BEGINNING AT TWO MONTHS . At approximately eight weeks , a miraculous thing occurs-your baby 's vision improves and for the first time , she can fully see you and can make direct eye contact . These beginning visual experiences of your baby play an important role in social and emotional development . " In particular , the mother 's emotionally expressive face is , by far , the most potent visual stimulus in the infant 's environment , " points out UCLA 's Alan Schore , " and the child 's intense interest in her face , especially in her eyes , leads him/her to track it in space to engage in periods of intense mutual gaze . " The result : Endorphin levels rise in the baby 's brain , causing pleasurable feelings of joy and excitement . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD THINKING : The mother pumps information and affection into the child , who participates only as an empty receptacle . THE NEW THINKING : We now know that the baby 's participation is crucial to creating a solid attachment bond . The loving gaze of parents to child is reciprocated by the baby with a loving gaze back to the parents , causing their endorphin levels to rise , thus completing a closed emotional circuit , a sort of " love loop . " Now , mother ( or father ) and baby are truly in a dynamic , interactive system . " In essence , we are talking less about what the mother is doing to the baby and more about how the mother is being with the baby and how the baby is learning to be with the mother , " says Schore . The final aspect of this developing interactive system between mother and child is the mother 's develo ment of an " emotional synchronize- tion " with her child . Schore defines this as the mother 's ability to tune into the baby 's internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly lying on the floor , happy to take in the sights and sounds of the environment . As you notice the baby looking for stimulation , you respond with a game of " peek-a-boo . " As you play with your child and she responds with shrieks of glee , you escalate the emotion with biger and bicker estares and facial expressions . Shortly thereafter , you notice the baby turns away . The input has reached its maximum and you sense your child needs you to back off for awhile as she goes back to a state of calm and restful inactivity . " The synchronization between the two is more than between their behavior and thoughts ; the synchronization is on a biological leveltheir brains and nervous systems are linked together , " points out Schore . " In this process , the mother is teaching and learning at the same time . As a result of this moment-by-moment matching of emotion , both partners increase their emotional connection to one another . In addition , the more the mother fine-tunes her activity level to the infant during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby to disengage and recover quietly during periods of nonplay , before initiating actively arousing play again . " Neuropsychological research now indicates that this attuned interaction-engaged play , disengagement and restful nonplay , followed by a return to play behavior-is especially helpful for brain growth and the development of cerebral circuits . This makes sense in light of the revelation that future cognitive development depends not on the cognitive stimulation of flashcards and videos , but on the attuned , dynamic and emotional interactions between parent and child . The play periods stimulate baby 's central nervous system to excitation , followed by a restful period of alert inactivity in which the developing brain is able to process the stimulation and the interaction . In this way , you , the parents , are the safe Photograph // ty net under your baby 's emotional highwire ; the act of calming her down , or giving her the opportunity to calm down , will help her learn to handle ever-increasing intensity of stimulation and thus build emotional tolerance and resilience . WHAT TO DO : There are two steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When in sync , you and baby will both experience positive emotion ; when out of sync , you will see negative emotions . If much of your interactions seem to result in negative emotion , then it is time to reflect on your contribution to the equation . In these instances , parents need to help one another discover what may be impeding the attunement process . Sometimes , on an unconscious level , it may be memories of our own childhood . For example , my friend sings nursery rhymes with a Boston accent , even though she grew up in New York , because her native Bostonian father sang them to her that way . While the " Fah-mah in the Dell " will probably not throw baby into a temper tantrum , it 's a good example of how our actions or parenting style may be problematic without our realizing it . But all parents have days when they are out of sync with baby , and the new perspective is that it 's not such a bad thing . In fact , it 's quite valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can become attuned again . The process of falling out of sync and then repairing the bond actually teaches children resilience , and a sense of confidence that the world will respond to them and repair any potential hurt . Finally , let your baby take the lead . Schore suggests we " follow baby 's own spontaneous expression of himself , " which lets the child know that another person , i.e. , mom or dad , can understand what he is feeling , doing , and even thinking . Such experiences , says Schore , assist in the development of the prefrontal area , which controls " empathy , and therefore that which makes us most human . " ' 4 . THE SHAME TRANSACTION Toward the end of the first year , as crawling turns to walking , a shift occurs in the communication between child and parents . " Observational studies show that 12month-olds receive more positive responses from mothers , while 18-month-olds receive more instructions and directions , " says Schore . In one study , mothers of toddlers expressed a prohibition-basically telling the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely because a mobile toddler has an uncanny knack for finding the most dangerous things to explore ? Yesterday , for example , I walked into the living room to find my daughter scribbling on the wall with a purple marker . " NO ! " shot out of my mouth . She looked up at me with stunned shock , then realized what she had done . Immediately , she hung her head , about to cry . I babbled on a bit about how markers are only for paper , yada-yada and then thought , " Heck , it 's washable . " As I put my arm around my daughter , I segued into a suggestion for another activity : washing the wall ! She brightened and raced to get the sponge . We had just concluded a " shame transaction . " OLD THINKING : Researchers considered all these " no 's " a necessary byproduct of child safety or the socialization process . After all , we must teach children to use the potty rather than wet the bed , not to hit another child when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not consider the function of shame vis-a-vis brain development Instead , they advised trying to limit situations in which the child would feel shame . NEW THINKING : It 's true that you want to limit the shame situations , but they are not simply a necessary evil in order to civilize your baby . Neurobiological studies indicate that episodes of shame like the one I described can actually stimulate the development of the right hemisphere , the brain 's source of creativity , emotion and sensitivity , as long as the shame period is short and followed by a recovery . In essence , it 's not the experience of shame that can be damaging , but rather the inability of the parent to help the child recover from that shame . WHAT TO DO : It 's important to understand " the growth-facilitating importance of small doses of shame in the socialization process of the infant , " says Schore . Embarrassment ( a component of shame ) first emerges around 14 months , when mom 's " no " resuits in the child lowering his head and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( my daughter scribbling on the wall ) to sudden deflation ( my " NO ! ' ' ) back to excitement ( " It 's okay , let 's wash the wall together " ) . During this rapid process , various parts of the brain get quite a workout and experience heightened connectivity , which strengthens these systems . The result is development of the orbitofrontal cortex ( cognitive area ) and limbic system ( emotional area ) and the ability for the two systems to interrelate emotional resiliency in the child and the ability to self regulate emotions and impulse control . What is important to remember about productive shame reactions is that there must be a quick recovery . Extended periods of shame result in a child learning to shut down , or worse , become hyperirritable , perhaps even violent . It 's common sense : Just think how you feel when someone embarrasses you . If that embarrassment goes on without relief , do n't you tend to either flee the situation or rail against it ? From these new research findings , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct and doing what your mother did . It 's also not about pushing the alphabet , multiplication tables or violin lessons . We now believe that by seeing the newborn as a whole person-as a thinking , feeling creature who can and should participate in his own emotional and cognitive development we can maximize the nurturing and stimulating potential of our relationship with a newborn baby READ MORE ABOUT IT The Irreducible Needs of Children : What Every Child Must Have to Grow , Learn and Flourish , T.
