Several hours later , Jocelyn dropped her pen , her hand aching from writing up her clients ' notes in their files . Glancing toward the window , she saw the patrol car still in front of the pawnshop . She stood , stretching her arms above her and rolling her head to ease the tension in her neck . <p> A knock sounded and sent her whirling around toward the door . She stared at it , not moving an inch . This time someone pounded against the wood , prodding her forward . She hurried from her office into the reception area and peered out the peephole . The sight of Sam Pierce stunned her . She had n't seen him in months  --  not since she 'd worked that child kidnapping in New Orleans with him . It had n't ended well , and they had n't parted on good terms . <p> Sam pivoted to leave . Quickly Jocelyn unlatched the lock and pulled the door open . <p> Halting , the over six-foot FBI agent glanced back at her . Dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , he fixed her with his intense stare , his tanned features making a mockery of the cool January weather . <p> " Jocelyn , it 's good to see you again . " <p> The formality in his voice made her wonder if he was only trying to be polite . <p> " I 'd like to have a word with you . Sheriff Reed said that Leah Farley left a message on your answering machine . I 'd like to listen to it . " <p> " The FBI is working Leah 's disappearance ? " <p> " Yes . " He took a step forward , forcing her to move to the side to allow him into the office . <p> " Really . I got the impression from the sheriff that he did n't think Leah had met with foul play . I 'm surprised he requested your assistance . " <p> " The mayor did . I do n't believe the sheriff was too happy , but he 's cooperating . " <p> " Good , because I do n't think Leah would run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " So you knew her well . Professionally or personally ? " He wore a no-nonsense facade as if they had n't dated for four months right before she had moved to Loomis . As if he had n't saved her life once . <p> Jocelyn waved Sam toward the chair in front of her desk in her office . She sat in hers behind it , biding her time while she gathered her composure . As a psychologist , she 'd learned to suppress any emotions she might experience in order to deal with a client 's problem . His presence strained that skill . <p> " Personally . We 're neighbors . " She knew she was stating the obvious , but Sam 's intense stare unnerved her , as though he remembered their time together but not fondly . He was one of the reasons she had come to Loomis nine months ago to open a private practice and teach a few classes at Loomis College . <p> Grinning , Sam threw a glance at the pawnshop across the street and said in a teasing tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he realized he 'd slipped too quickly into a casual , friendliness toward her , he stiffened , the smile gone . <p> His sudden change pricked her curiosity . He did n't like this any more than she did . That realization made getting through the interview a little easier . She relaxed the tensed set of her shoulders . <p> When she had started seeing Sam in New Orleans , she had known it was n't wise to date someone she had to work with from time to time in volatile , intense situations . Being a consultant on kidnapping cases where children were involved had thrown them together over the course of the year he 'd been in the Big Easy . <p> Jocelyn gripped the edge of her desk . " Look , I 'm happy to let you hear the recording , and I 'll help in any other way I can , but I insist on us putting our former relationship in the past where it belongs . " Their relationship started when Sam rescued her from a patient 's father who tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together on a kidnapping case that ended violently . Brutality had surrounded her in New Orleans . She thought she 'd escaped it by coming to Loomis . <p> " Do you mean it ? You 'll help with this case ? Because I was thinking we need someone with your experience . " His frosty gaze melted a few degrees . <p> Although she now worked with all ages , in missing-persons cases she 'd dealt only with the children involved . " Well , yes . I 'll help . But since children are my specialty , I 'm not sure how " She drew in a deep breath . " Sarah . You want me to work with Leah 's daughter ? " <p> Sam nodded . " I think the key to Leah 's disappearance may be wrapped up in her husband 's suicide , so I 'll be looking into that , too . Were you aware that Sarah might have witnessed her father 's death ? " <p> Leah 's heartbeat quickened . Poor little Sarah ! <p> Leah swallowed and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I would n't have left . I thought Sarah was asleep upstairs in her bedroom . Earl shot himself downstairs in his office in the store . " <p> " Apparently Leah 's brother told the sheriff his sister was beginning to think that Sarah might have seen or heard something from a couple of things the child said to her mother . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Clint did n't know . Leah left Sarah with him before he could question her further about it . " <p> " That poor child . " <p> " I need to know what she knows . " <p> " She 's only three . It may be very little . Have you talked with Clint ? The sheriff said that Sarah is staying with him . " <p> " No , but I 'm heading out to his house to interview him after I leave here . I want you to come along and assess Sarah . " <p> Just like old times  --  unpleasant ones . Do n't go there . Why , Lord , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I 'd give you the tape , but I use an answering service . " The second time she heard it Jocelyn was even more convinced Leah was in trouble . Was it due to her husband 's suicide or something else ? Where did Sarah fit into this ? Had the child heard or seen something she should n't have ? <p> " Why would she call you ? Is n't Shelby Mason her closest friend ? " <p> " My , you have been busy . How long have you been in town ? " <p> " A few hours . " He captured her gaze , intensity pouring off of him . " You are n't seeing Leah professionally , are you ? " <p> Clenching her teeth , she curled her hand around her pen until it dug into her palm . " No . We 're friends , but lately she has used me more and more as a sounding board when something 's bothering her . " <p> " What was she bothered by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a client . " <p> " Her marriage . She and Earl were having trouble . " <p> " The kind that could drive her to kill her husband and leave her child ? " <p> " I told you I ca n't see Leah doing anything like that . " <p> " Leave her child or murder her husband ? " <p> " Both . " Before she snapped her pen in half , Jocelyn placed it on top of the folder she was working on . <p> " You , better than most , know that when people are pushed too far , they are capable of doing something you 'd never think they could . " Sam rose , hovering in front of her desk . " Will you come with me to Clint Herald 's ? " <p> She wanted to say no , not be dragged into the seedy side of life that had taken up so much of her time in New Orleans , but she could n't . Leah was a friend . Shelby , Leah and she had once been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble and needed her help ? " Yes . " <p> " Thanks , I appreciate it . " <p> The formal tone returned to his voice and bearing , and she grasped it like a life preserver . So long as he kept things professional , she would be able to help Leah  --  that was , if she could keep herself from remembering her and Sam 's past relationship . <p> She locked her office and trailed him to the parking lot at the side of the building . He headed for his black nondescript sedan . <p> " I 'll drive myself . " Jocelyn paused a few feet from her yellow T-bird . <p> Over the top of his vehicle he studied her for a moment , then shrugged . " Suit yourself . I 'll follow you , since I 'm not familiar with Loomis . " <p> When she pulled out onto Main Street , she noticed the sheriff coming out of the pawnshop with several plastic bags , probably full of evidence . Seeing them brought to mind the other child from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save . <p> His hands tight on the steering wheel , Sam kept sight of the yellow Thunderbird a few yards in front of him . He 'd known that Jocelyn had left New Orleans for a job in a Louisiana town north of the city , but he had n't been prepared to see her again today  --  and worse , needing to work with her . <p> Being with her brought back the memories of the last case they 'd handled together . For several seconds the image of the little five-year-old boy 's body , bruised and beaten , and the horror on Jocelyn 's face at the sight flashed across his mind like a strobe light . Jocelyn 's reaction drew his own repulsion to the foreground . He 'd almost quit his job . <p> He gripped the wheel until his hands ached . He had n't found the child in time , and that would haunt him for the rest of his life . It flashed in his mind alongside his own younger brother 's face the last time he 'd seen him twenty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing images as Jocelyn turned into the driveway of an older two-story house with huge oaks dripping Spanish moss standing sentinel in front . Parking behind her , Sam shut down his thoughts of the past . He could n't let anything cloud his judgment while working the case . He 'd concentrate on solving it soon and be gone from Loomis . <p> After joining Jocelyn on the porch , he leaned around her and pressed the bell . She kept her gaze trained forward , the silence between them taut . Her faint scent of vanilla tempted him with memories . The sight of her long blond hair , free from the usual clasp at her nape , billowing about her shoulders or the feel of her soft hand in his <p> A click wrenched him back to the present . Relieved when the door opened to reveal a large man with dark features and a grim expression on his face , Sam pulled out his badge . " I 'm Special Agent Pierce with the FBI . I 'm here to look into your sister 's disappearance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm glad someone is finally taking this seriously . I could n't get the sheriff to listen to me yesterday when I told him that Leah would n't leave Sarah unless something bad had happened to her . " Clint stepped to the side to allow them into his house . " Come in . And hi , Jocelyn . I was just about to put Sarah down for a late nap . I 'll take care of that and then we can talk . " <p> " I thought Jocelyn could inter  --  talk with your niece . " <p> " Why ? Sarah was here when Leah went missing . " <p> " But Sarah was at the apartment at the time of her father 's death . " Sam stuffed his badge back into his pocket . <p> " She 's only three . She ca n't tell you anything ! " Clint 's voice roughened as he shifted his gaze to something behind Sam . <p> Sam glanced back . A little girl with blond hair and sea-green almond-shaped eyes came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sucking her thumb , Sarah latched on to her uncle 's leg and buried her face against him , occasionally peeking up at Jocelyn . <p> " Clint , I 'd love to put Sarah down for a nap . She 's stayed with me some when Leah needed a sitter . That way you and Sam can talk . " <p> " But , she  --  " Clint settled his hand on Sarah 's shoulder as though he would keep her glued to his side . <p> " Do n't worry . Sarah and I are good buddies . " <p> Clint stared at Jocelyn for a long moment , then nodded . " I know . " <p> She knelt next to the little girl and held out her hand . " Sarah , I 'd love to see your room . Will you show me ? " <p> The child clung to her uncle for a few more seconds , then walked over to Jocelyn . Jocelyn rose with Sarah in her arms . " Which way ? " <p> Clutching her blanket , Leah 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staircase . <p> Jocelyn left Sam alone with Clint , who watched his niece disappear up the stairs . Sam knew firsthand how traumatic it was when a family member went missing . That was why he was part of the Missing Persons Unit , although at times it was painful not to provide a happy ending to each case . <p> " Let 's go in here , " Clint said , gesturing toward his den , tension threaded through each word . " Leah and Sarah are all the family I have left . I 'm glad my call to the mayor produced results because Sheriff Reed was n't doing anything . " <p> Sam folded his long length into a chair across from the couch and took out his notepad . " Tell me about the day Leah dropped off Sarah for you to watch her . " <p> Clint stared toward the entry hall as though Leah were still standing there with Sarah and he could erase the past thirty hours . " The last time I saw my sister , she was acting a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was anxious or afraid of something . At the time I thought it was because of Earl 's suicide , but now I do n't know . I should have questioned my sister more before she left . " <p> " What did she say to you ? " <p> Another long pause , then Clint swung his attention to Sam . " She said she had some business to take care of and would n't be gone long . She was worried that Sarah had seen something when Earl killed himself . When she said the word business , she said it with such firmness . I got the feeling she was confirming something in her mind . " <p> " She did n't say who she was meeting or what Sarah had seen ? " <p> " No , and before I could ask , she kissed Sarah goodbye and thrust her into my arms , then hurried away . " Clint dragged his hand through his hair . " I thought at first she was just running late , but when she did n't come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've called her cell phone repeatedly , but it goes straight to voice mail . " <p> " What did you do next ? " <p> " I called her friends , the hospital , highway patrol and the sheriff after putting Sarah down early last night . I did n't want her to know what was going on . " <p> " There 's nothing else ? " <p> Again he plowed his fingers through his hair . " You do n't know how many times I 've wished there was something else . A lead . A hint . Anything . " <br> Continues ...
