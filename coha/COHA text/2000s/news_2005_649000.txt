<p> The fight for jersey No. 26 is going all the way to courtroom No. 161B . <p> Next month , the District Court of Maryland will try to answer the question being posed in locker rooms everywhere : how much for your number ? <p> Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis agreed to pay defensive back Ifeanyi Ohalete $40,000 for No. 26 last year , but after Ohalete was released by the team in August , he accused Portis of stopping payments and paying only half the sum . <p> Ohalete , now wearing No. 25 for the Arizona Cardinals , is claiming breach of contract and suing Portis in a trial scheduled to begin June 7 in Upper Marlboro , Md . " It 's not exactly the kind of case you see every day , " John Steren , Ohalete 's lawyer , said . <p> But it is just the kind of conflict that plays out every season . When a prominent athlete joins a new team after contract talks , the negotiations in a high-stakes numbers game have often only just begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 10 until he sold it to the rookie quarterback Eli Manning last spring for a one-week vacation in Florida . Then Feagles switched to No. 17 , which he sold this off-season to receiver Plaxico Burress for a new outdoor kitchen at his home in Phoenix . <p> " The guys in the equipment room tell me I 'm the luckiest person they 've ever seen , " said Feagles , who hashed out the kitchen deal with Burress 's agent , Drew Rosenhaus . " Think about what I 've profited in the past two years just from my jersey number . Now I have No. 18 , and everyone is wondering if any of the rookies are going to want it . " <p> Mets pitcher Tom Glavine never really even liked No. 47 , but it was given to him by the Atlanta Braves at his first spring training and therefore symbolizes everything he overcame to stick in the major leagues . So when Glavine signed with the Mets two years ago and Joe McEwing handed over No. 47 , Glavine and his wife financed a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play long enough , " Glavine said , " that number becomes your identity . " <p> For many professional athletes , a jersey number is a personal brand . It is worn on shoes and helmets , wristbands and turtlenecks . It inspires tattoos and is engraved on medallions the size of manhole covers . <p> Players who have been successful with certain digits are often too superstitious to change . They wonder if they can put up the same numbers while wearing a different number . <p> Lee Evans was a rookie for the Buffalo Bills last year when he paid $20,000 to his teammate Mark Campbell for No. 83 . The Cleveland Browns rookie Kellen Winslow pried No. 80 from his teammate Aaron Shea for a package of suits , meals and a vacation totaling around $30,000 . Last month , the veteran outfielder Brian Jordan trumped both of them when he bought a $40,000 motorcycle for Fredi Gonzalez , the Braves ' third-base coach , to thank him for No. 33 . <p> " I think he was just expecting a golf shirt or something , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It 's the way people in Atlanta recognize me . " <p> The price of jersey numbers has escalated at almost the same rate as the value of player contracts . In 1989 , Oakland 's Rickey Henderson got No. 24 from Ron Hassey by substituting for him at an autograph session . In 1991 , Philadelphia reliever Mitch Williams got No. 28 from John Kruk for two cases of beer . <p> But by 1993 , when Henderson wanted No. 24 with the Toronto Blue Jays , he had to pay outfielder Turner Ward $25,000 . <p> " I did n't even think of asking for money , " Kruk said . " The only reason Mitch wanted the number is because his wife had a lot of No. 28 jewelry and he did n't want to buy her any more jewelry . <p> " Not long after that , he got divorced and changed numbers . " <p> There have been Hawaiian baseball players , like Sid Fernandez and Benny Agbayani , who wore No. 50 because they were from the 50th state . There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Al Oliver and Rey Ordonez , who requested and wore No. 0 . <p> And there was one self-deprecating hockey player , Neil Sheehy , who wore No. 0 because he said that he was as far away as anyone could get from Wayne Gretzky , No. 99 . <p> The trends are so difficult to track that espn.com has its own uniform columnist , Paul Lukas , who can tell you that Nick Van Exel once wore No. 37 because he was the 37th pick in the N.B.A. draft , that catcher Benito Santiago once wore No. 09 so that the strap on the back of his chest protector would not cross through the No. 9 , and that the Czech hockey star Jaromir Jagr wears No. 68 because of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 . <p> " Anyone playing the lottery can tell you about lucky numbers , " Lukas said . " And as long as salaries go up , the price for numbers will probably go up , too . For today 's athlete , what 's the difference between buying a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faubion of San Francisco , who studies numerology , the effect of numbers on people 's lives , said : " When there 's a number that resonates with you , it will bring you something positive . If someone says , ' I hate my number ; I wish I had another number , ' they probably wo n't do well with it . " <p> Faubion would advise any athlete to pick a jersey number that corresponds to his birth date , making Mets pitcher Kris Benson her ideal example . Benson said he wore No. 7 in high school because he was born on Nov. 7 . When he could not get that number at Clemson  --  the head coach was wearing it  --  he opted for No. 34 because three plus four equals seven . If Benson were a European soccer player , he might have even taped a plus sign between the digits on his jersey , a recent trend spotted overseas . <p> Oakland 's Barry Zito came up wearing No. 34 because he wanted to pitch like Benson , but when the Athletics retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollie Fingers , Zito picked No. 75 . <p> " I 'm really into numbers and symmetry , and if you look at the 75 , it creates a really nice shelf under my name , " Zito said . " There 's also an added bonus . Not too many people have it , so if I get traded somewhere else , I probably wo n't have to give up a Rolex . " <p> That is exactly what pitcher Roger Clemens gave Carlos Delgado as thanks for No. 21 in Toronto . When Clemens went to the Yankees , he had to settle for No. 22 because Paul O'Neill had 21 . And when Clemens bolted for Houston , he had to keep No. 22 because his teammate Andy Pettitte got No. 21 a month earlier as a tribute to Clemens . Delgado , who gave up No. 21 even though he was wearing it for the Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente , a fellow Puerto Rican , said he still had the Rolex in a safety deposit box . <p> Even college teams are starting to recruit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Southern California , he asked to wear No. 20 , which had long been retired for Mike Garrett , winner of the 1965 Heisman Trophy . Conveniently , Garrett is still on campus , working as the athletic director , and he gave Bing the necessary permission . <p> For all the locker-room deals that have been struck , nearly as many have stalled . Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor reportedly offered $10,000 to his teammate Aaron Beasley for No. 21 after the 1998 draft , but he was turned down . Frank Viola asked Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden for No. 16 in 1989 , to which Gooden responded : " He can have my wife . But he ca n't have my number . " The same season , Steve Sax joined the Yankees and inquired about No. 3 . He apparently forgot it had been retired for Babe Ruth . <p> The Yankees , who used to give out jersey numbers based on a hitter 's position in the batting order , have retired 15 numbers . But their ranks are empty compared with the Boston Celtics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when forward Antoine Walker returned to Boston this season , the rookie Al Jefferson handed him No. 8 and did not ask for anything tangible in return . <p> " I just told him to teach me everything he knows about the game , " Jefferson told reporters . " Ai n't all about the money .
