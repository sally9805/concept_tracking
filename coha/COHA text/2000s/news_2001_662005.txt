<p> When people talk about a new smash hit on Broadway or a record winning streak at Yankee Stadium , Marty Lederhandler just smiles . Nobody 's had a longer run in New York than he has . <p> But the man who photographed mayors from Fiorello La Guardia to Rudy Giuliani , hit Utah Beach on D-Day , and accompanied Nelson and Happy Rockefeller on their Venezuelan honeymoon , is hanging up his cameras at The Associated Press after 66 years on the job . <p> Lederhandler , who turned 84 on Nov. 23 , retires at the end of the year . " It 's time to go , and give someone else a chance to do the things I 've done , " he says . <p> No chance . <p> The Gotham native leaves a celluloid legacy second to none - fires , murders , parades , sports events and plane crashes ; every president from Herbert Hoover ( retired ) to Bill Clinton ; royals , actors , crooks , spies , athletes , cultural icons and most top world leaders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller 's Manhattan apartment , and Winston Churchill in Bernard Baruch 's . " Do n't shoot ' til you see the whites of their eyes , " Churchill growled as Lederhandler aimed his lens . <p> He was standing beside Fidel Castro at the United Nations when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev strode up and gave the Cuban leader a bear hug . Prevented by the crush of bodies from reaching his color camera , Lederhandler got the picture only in black and white . But only he got it . <p> During that 15th General Assembly meeting in 1960 - awash in famous heads of state from Nehru to Tito - Lederhandler developed an affinity for covering the world body . <p> " Without his consummate skill and untiring professionalism , many great moments in the history of the United Nations would have gone unrecorded , " Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a recent letter to AP . <p> Lederhandler joined AP full-time in March 1936 ( he 'd started part-time the year before ) and spent the next 6 1/2 decades looking at life through a lens . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longevity every day , a sort of journalistic version of Joe DiMaggio 's 56-game hitting streak . <p> To say he 's seen it all may be an exaggeration , but not by much . <p> Haile Selassie , Eleanor Roosevelt , Queen Elizabeth II , Jack Dempsey , Joe Louis , Elizabeth Taylor , Carl Sandburg , Douglas MacArthur , Bertrand Russell , Groucho Marx , Malcolm X , Liberace , Yasser Arafat , Frank Sinatra , Frank Costello , Aristotle Onassis , Anwar Sadat , Van Cliburn , James Cagney , the Beatles , Sophia Loren , Nelson Mandela , Muhammad Ali and Luciano Pavarotti are a sampling of people freeze-framed by Lederhandler 's lens . <p> Marty and an older brother , Harry , got into cameras as a teen-age hobby during the Depression , and went to work at AP as $12 a week photo messengers , learning the craft in their spare time with a Speed Graphic they bought together . <p> Marty figured out how to double his income by using a tunnel to deliver photos to the Daily News a few blocks away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heady stuff for a 17-year-old boy . <p> " Everything was exciting , and I got caught up in it , " Lederhandler says . " New York was the center of the world . " <p> Drafted by the Army in 1940 , Lederhandler earned lieutenant 's bars in Officer Candidate School and became leader of a six-man Signal Corps combat photo team . <p> On June 6 , 1944 , he landed on Utah Beach with the 4th Infantry Division , lugging his cameras and two caged pigeons to fly the film back to England . His second pigeon fluttered into the sky , turned east instead of west , and vanished . <p> A month later Marty 's unit found German newspapers in an abandoned command post near Cherbourg . " One of my photos was on the front page . The caption was just propaganda , but the German editors duly credited the shot to ' U.S.A. reporter , Lt. Lederhandler . " ' <p> Lederhandler celebrated the liberation of Paris in a " three-day Mardi Gras " with fellow war correspondents Ernie Pyle and Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle of the Bulge in Belgium . <p> The ex-soldier returned to France for the 50th anniversary of D-Day , walking now-quiet Utah Beach and visiting villages he had last seen in 1944 . <p> A man of sly wit , Lederhandler seems to have an anecdote for every picture and constantly surprises colleagues with stories they 've never heard before . <p> He arrived at work one day in 1998 with an envelope containing old black-and-white photos of Adolf Hitler and other top Nazis , burned around the edges . <p> The pictures , he explained , had been sent to New York by AP 's Berlin bureau in May , 1937 - on the dirigible Hindenburg . Two weeks after the airship exploded and burned on landing at Lakehurst , N.J. , the package was delivered to AP . <p> When his editor expressed no interest in keeping the fire-damaged photos , 19-year-old Lederhandler had the presence of mind to take them home . They became a historic centerpiece for AP 's 150th anniversary observance . <p> Lederhandler 's first AP photo was an artsy 1936 shot of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't tell if you 're looking up or down , " he says . But he may be best remembered for one of his last . <p> When the World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11 , Lederhandler crossed the street from AP 's Rockefeller Center office , took an elevator to the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of the GE building and photographed the blazing towers in the distance , with the Empire State Building in the foreground . <p> That iconic picture made the cover of New York magazine and the cover of " Sept. 11 , 2001 , " a best-selling book published by the magazine . <p> In an odd way , Lederhandler says , the terrorist strikes helped him decide to retire . " Twice is more than enough , " he said , referring to the 1993 bombing of the twin towers and the Sept. 11 attacks by hijacked jetliners . <p> Lederhandler 's career paralleled the march of technology from heavy , cumbersome Speed Graphics to high-speed film and motor-driven 35-mm cameras - and recently , to digital cameras . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " You could only carry eight to ten plate holders - 16 to 20 pictures . You had to wait for the moment , even anticipate the moment , and compensate for a tiny delay between the button and the shutter . But you learned to do all that . " <p> The old-style cameras also encouraged a decorum seen rarely at a present-day show opening or a police station " perp walk , " he says . <p> " Not only did press photographers wear suits , ties and hats , everybody had the same lenses , and we had to stand back eight or 10 feet . There was some jostling , but no radio and TV microphones - nothing like the pushing and shoving you see today . " <p> Lederhandler 's own perp walks included famed bank robber Willie Sutton and Soviet atom spy Ethel Rosenberg , whom he pictured leaving a federal courthouse after her conviction and arriving later at Sing Sing prison , where she and her husband Julius were executed in 1953 . <p> One of Lederhandler 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When photographers were barred from taking pictures of the reclusive Charles Lindbergh at an aeronautics industry dinner , Lederhandler paid a hotel photographer $10 for an enlarged image of the Lone Eagle from a group shot . <p> In 1963 , he scooped the competition by buying a seat on the Pan Am flight that was taking New York Gov . Nelson Rockefeller and his bride , Happy , on their honeymoon . <p> " Other photographers were at the airport to get the departure , and were shocked when I walked past them and got aboard , " Lederhandler says . <p> " I was able to make pictures of the Rockefellers on the plane and when they got off in Caracas . My film went straight back to Miami on the first flight , and the arrival picture made Page 1 of the Daily News , while the New York departure shots were on inside pages .
