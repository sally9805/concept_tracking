What 's this winter 's sleeper sports hit ? Snowshoeing , a 6,000-year- old activity that may now be surpassing cross-country skiing in popularity . Today 's snowshoes do n't look anything like the old leather , wood and rawhide models we all tried in high school . The new shoe has a high-tech look that has revolutionized the sport . It 's lighter , shorter , more durable and easier to use . Snowshoes now come in a variety of styles that cater to both the serious outdoors enthusiast and the casual recreational user . Not only do they allow you to easily manoeuvre through the woods or up a mountain , they 're also good for exercising close to home , walking on frozen lakes or traversing the local golf course . One of the best new features is the bindings . They fit over any boot and can be easily attached and adjusted  --  without having to take off your mitts . Another plus : Crampons ( spikes ) under the heel and toes grip the ice and snow , making ascents and descents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what you plan to do . Serious off-trail hikers need a larger model to keep them from sinking into deep snow . A trekker laden down with a heavy backpack needs a snowshoe with extra width and length . There are special models for racing on packed snow : The bindings accommodate a pair of running shoes or light hiking boots , and the design is ultralight for maximum speed . Recreational users wear light , small snowshoes that may not float as well on top of the snow , but are easier to handle . And you may want to add ski poles to help you climb and provide extra stability . They also add an upper-body workout to an already intense form of exercise . But the nicest thing about the new snowshoes is they 're fun as soon as you put them on . It takes about ten minutes to get used to the shoes and learn how to move through snow . Then you 're off , traipsing through the woods like an expert , burning 500 to 1,000 calories an hour , depending on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , this is not a casual winter stroll : If you 're not in good shape , start with 20- to 30-minute treks on packed trails before attempting tougher terrain . Dashing through the Snow For those who want to snowshoe for the health of it , travelling through the woods in deep powder is a fantastic workout . Walkers who are n't interested in cross-country skiing can explore the beauty of the wilderness after a fresh snowfall without worrying about waxing or crowds . But be warned : It takes about 45 percent more energy to walk in snowshoes than in athletic shoes . A leisurely hike through the snow is n't the only way to work out on snowshoes . Runners who are tired of combatting the perilous roads and icy sidewalks can head out to groomed trails that are built for speed . Getting Outfitted Once you 've got the right shoe , do n't forget to dress the rest of your body properly , too . Snowshoeing works up a sweat fast , so wearing removable layers is essential . You 'll also need a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the snow out . And it 's important to take a back-pack filled with water and snacks  --  you 'll need them if you 're going to be out for more than 30 minutes . Many ski centres have snowshoe trails where you can rent equipment , get some instruction and hike through groomed trails . Rent before you buy , as the price for a pair of snowshoes starts at $189 . Outdoor stores also rent them for $10 to $15 a day . Bring the boot you 're going to wear on the trail to the store or rental outlet , and tell the salesperson what kind of trekking you plan to do so that you can get the right kind of snowshoe . Then head out to the wide open spaces and kick up some powder . <p>
