After Harriet Miers asked President George W. Bush to withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court on Oct. 27 , she went back to the second floor of the West Wing and resumed her job as White House counsel that afternoon . She had sparked a conservative revolt against the Bush Administration and got withering reviews from some Republican Senators , but that was over . " There was a lot of work to do , and I sort of turned to it , " she told TIME in her first interview with a national publication since her withdrawal . <P> Back at Bush 's side , Miers is one of the dwindling number of longtime Texas confidants still at the White House at this time of upheaval . The loyalty is reciprocal  --  Bush was still hot months later about how she was treated , viewing her as a victim of snobby litists . To White House officials , Miers is a quiet workaholic who got an inexcusably raw deal . To some outsiders , her name remains synonymous with Administration missteps  --  a conservative columnist called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Miers , 60 , declines to cast blame for her nomination 's demise , preferring to " leave all that for other people to analyze . " Her brothers were upset by the uglier comments about her , but she professes no bitterness . " Many aspects of that process were very enriching and very enjoyable , " she says , pointing to her discussions with Senators and reconnections with childhood friends who called and wrote . " I 'm grateful to all the people who were very supportive . It was a lengthy process , but it allowed me time to focus on the importance of the court , " she says . " I ca n't imagine , for a lawyer , a more meaningful opportunity . " <P> Miers , who has n't had a vacation other than Christmas since well before the Supreme Court episode , hopes to take some time with her family in May  --  although " nothing grand . " She gives unpaid speeches to bar associations and will speak at a law-school commencement next month . How about writing a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities , " she says . Her work , after all , is of national importance . Take her first major task after her withdrawal : she helped prepare the nomination four days later of Samuel Alito Jr. , who wound up getting the job .
