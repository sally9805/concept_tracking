Headnote It took five years , two screenwriters , and $180 million to turn a best-selling antireligious children 's book into a star-studded epic-just in time for Christmas . This month , New Line Cinema will release The Golden Compass , based on the first book in a trilogy of edgy children 's novels written by the British author Philip Pullman . A trailer for the movie evokes The Lord of the Rings , and comparisons have been made to The Chronicles of Narnia . All three are epic adventures that unfold in a rich fantasy world , perfect for the big screen . But beyond that basic description , the comparisons fall apart . In the past , Pullman has expressed mainly contempt for the books on which the other movies were based . He once dismissed the Lord of the Rings trilogy as an " infantile work " primarily concerned with " maps and plans and languages and codes . " Narnia got it even worse : " Morally loathsome , " he called it . " One of the most ugly and poisonous things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own series as Narnia 's moral opposite . " That 's the Christian one , " he told me . " And mine is the non-Christian . " Pullman 's books have sold 15 million copies worldwide , although it 's difficult to imagine adolescent novels any more openly subversive . The series , known collectively as His Dark Materials , centers on Lyra Belacqua , a preteen orphan who 's pursued by a murderous institution known as " the Magisterium . " Or to use the more familiar name , " the Holy Church . " In its quest to eradicate sin , the Church sanctions experiments involving the kidnap and torture of hundreds of children-experiments that separate body from soul and leave the children to stumble around zombie-like , and then die . The series builds up to a cataclysmic war between Heaven and Earth , on the model of Paradise Lost ( the source of the phrase his dark materials ) . But in Pullman 's version , God is revealed to be a charlatan more pitiable even than Oz . His death scene is memorable only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demented being , called " the ancient of days , " cowers and cries like a baby , dissolving in air . The final book climaxes , so to speak , in a love scene that could rattle the sensibilities of an American culture that tolerates even Girls Gone Wild , because in this case the girl is still a few years away from college . ( More on this later . ) Four years ago , before anyone worried about marketing a movie , Pullman wondered why his books had n't attracted as much controversy as the Harry Potter series-another Hollywood favorite . As he told The Sydney Morning Herald , he was " saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said . My books are about killing God . " In 2001 , Pullman became the first author to win the prestigious Whitbread Award for a children 's book- The Amber Spyglass , the third book in the series . A six-hour London theater production of the books sold out its entire fourmonth run even before the reviews were published . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his critique of religion . But they , like his adolescent readers , get drawn into his world by his fantastic imagination . The series begins in a parallel Oxford , England , at " Jordan College , " where the familiar and the fantastic coexist . Lyra is the anti-Disney heroine : an unruly , unteachable orphan cared for by the university 's dons who spits and lies her way out of trouble . She cobbles together a family from other brave , reckless cast-offs like herself : a kitchen boy ; a young , runaway murderer ; gypsies and witches . For a time she finds a surrogate father in Iorek Byrnison , a deposed bear king decked out in metal armor who speeds her through one of several parallel worlds . ( As with most fantasies , any attempt to summarize plot and character edges too close to Dungeons &; Dragons . Trust me , in the novels it all hangs together . ) Her most intimate relationship is with her " daemon , " a soul that lives outside the body in animal form . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form-hers can shift rapidly from moth to ermine to rat , depending on her mood-until its companion hits puberty , at which point it settles as a fitting animal . The daemons of the Holy Church functionaries ? They tend to be dogs . To an industry intoxicated with sophisticated visual effects , Pullman 's creations were irresistible . In 2003 , when describing what sold him on the movie , Toby Emmerich , New Line 's president of production , explained , " It was two words : Iorek Byrnison . " Iorek is an " insanely awesome character , " he added . " He ca n't tell a lie , " Emmerich told me recently , " and Lyra is an expert liar . " And Hollywood had a precedent in the perfect chemistry between Narnia 's little Lucy and the special-effects Hon Asian . ( Of course , Asian is a stand-in for Jesus , while Iorek helps Lyra conquer the forces of God . ) New Line commissioned the first script in 2002 . In the five years since-spanning two writers , two directors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to characterize the villains in the movie . You can probably guess how things turned out . Given enough time and effort , Hollywood can tweak and polish and recast even the darkest message until it would seem at home in a Fourth of July parade . In the end , the religious meaning of the book was obscured so thoroughly as to be essentially indecipherable . The studio settled on villains that , as Emmerich put it , " feel vaguely kind of like a fascistic , totalitarian dictatorship , Russian/KGB/SS " stew . The movie 's main theme became , in one producer 's summary , " One small child can save the world . " With $180 million at stake , the studio opted to kidnap the book 's body and leave behind its soul . When director Ridley Scott was shooting Blade Runner , Philip K. Dick had a feverish , paranoid vision of the filming . He imagined himself seizing leading man Harrison Ford by the throat and " battering him against the wall , " he told The Twilight Zone Magazine in 1982 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing Thorazine on him as he screamed , " You 've destroyed my book ! " By that standard , Pullman has remained serene about the translation of his own book to film . In August , I met him in Oxford , where he used to live before too many fans came knocking at his door ( he now lives a few miles outside of town ) . Despite his frequent combative essays in British papers , Pullman in person is an exceedingly amiable man . At 61 , he preserves the air of the middle-school teacher he once was . He is tall , with tufts of gray hair and sly , amused eyes . When we met , he wore a rumpled oxford shirt and carried a beat-up leather satchel . It 's easy to imagine him meeting dull student questions with the liveliest of answers . In the past , Pullman has defended the " good faith of the film-makers " and denied any " betrayal . " On the surface , his relationship with the studio has remained " cordial , " as he put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrimages to Oxford , and the two men exchange e-mails . Pullman got to review a video of the final 50 candidates for the part of Lyra , and he has made script suggestions . Still , the studio publicist seemed nervous when she heard I was going to visit him . All things being equal , Pullman told me , New Line would prefer he were , well , the late author of The Golden Compass . Dead ? " Yes ! Absolutely ! " If something happened to him , there " would be expressions of the most heartfelt regrets , yet privately they would be saying , " Thank God . ' ' " When we met , Pullman had just been to a screening of the film , and he praised many specific scenes . He was thrilled with Dakota Blue Richards , the previously unknown English schoolgirl who plays Lyra . And with Nicole Kidman , whom he described as having the " exact quality of warm and cold , seductive and terrifying " to portray the tender and evil Marisa Coulter . In discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role now is to be " sensible " so that the next two films get made . Nonetheless , he was honest about what was missing : " They do know where to put the theology , " he said , " and that 's off the film . " Long silence . Then , " I think if everything that is made explicit in the book or everything that is implied clearly in the book or everything that can be understood by a close reading of the book were present in the film , they 'd have the biggest hit they 've ever had in their lives . If they allowed the religious meaning of the book to be fully explicit , it would be a huge hit Suddenly , they 'd have letters of appreciation from people who felt this but never dared say it They would be the heroes of liberal thought , of freedom of thought ... And it would be the greatest pity if that did n't happen . " I did n't put that very well . What I mean is that I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I do n't want to do , you see , is talk the other two films out of existence . So I 'll stop there . " Pullman has expressed admiration for Richard Dawkins , a fellow British atheist . Like him , Pullman views the prevailing forms of religion as destructive and oppressive forces in history . " Every single religion that has a monotheistic god ends up by persecuting other people and killing them because they do n't accept him , " he once said . But his views are not as coldly antiseptic as Dawkins 's . He grew up going to Sunday school and has only fond memories of serving as a choirboy in his grandfather 's rural Anglican parish . One of Pullman 's favorite subjects is the moral power of stories , and he can sound preacher-like when he addresses it . " Thou shalt not " might reach the head , but it takes " Once upon a time " to reach the heart , " he once wrote . Pullman 's own books are full of the mysticism and grandeur often associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal . " We need joy , we need a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives , we need a connection with the universe , we need all the things the Kingdom of Heaven used to promise us but failed to deliver , " he said in a 2000 speech . When pressed , Pullman grants that he 's not really trying to kill God , but rather the outdated idea of God as an old guy with a beard in the sky . In his novels , he replaces the idea of God with " Dust , " made up of invisible particles that begin to cluster around people when they hit puberty . The Church believes Dust to be the physical evidence of original sin and hopes to eradicate it But over the course of the series , Pullman reveals it to be the opposite : evidence of human consciousness , a kind of godlike energy that surrounds everyone . People accumulate Dust by " thinking and feeling and reflecting , by gaining wisdom and passing it on . " It starts to build up around puberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-knowledge and intellectual curiosity . To him , the loss of sexual innocence is not a tragedy ; it 's the springboard to a productive and virtuous adulthood . The most curious aspect of Pullman 's theology is the primacy he places on teen sexuality ; like the best heavymetal songs , the whole series builds up to a celebration of losing your virginity , or at least getting to first base . In The Amber Spyglass , a former nun turned physicist guides Lyra to her destiny using clues from the I Ching . The physicist divines that she should tell Lyra the story of when she was 12 years old at a birthday party and a boy " took a bit of marzipan and he just gently put it in my mouth , " and she fell in love . This simple story sets off salvation . When she hears it , Lyra " felt something strange happen to her body . She felt a stirring at the roots of her hair : she found herself breathing faster . " ( At least that 's what she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines out . ) A few scenes later , Lyra , alone in the woods with her friend Will , lifts a little red fruit " gently to his mouth . " They bump together clumsily , and Will is soon described , in terms familiar to Playboy readers , " kissing her hot face over and over again , drinking in with adoration the scent of her body , " his nerves " ablaze . " What happens next is not entirely clear . The scene is intended as a rewriting of Genesis , with Lyra replaying the role of Eve , so presumably some nakedness is required . But she and Will are still several years shy of 18 , which might make the scene 's fullest implication illegal in some states . When critics accused Pullman of sanctioning underage sex , he said : " Nowhere in the book do I talk about anything more than a kiss . And as a child , a kiss is enough . A kiss can change the world . " What the novel says is , " Around them there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding its breath . " When they return from the woods , after an ambiguous gap in the narrative , holding hands and " oblivious to everything else , " all is suddenly well with the world : " The Dust pouring down from the stars had found a living home again , and these **27;3059;TOOLONG , saturated with love , were the cause of it all . " " This is exactly what happens in the Garden of Eden , " Pullman told me . " They become aware of sexuality , of the power the body has to attract attention from someone else . This is not only natural , but a wonderful thing ! To be celebrated ! Why the Christian Church has spent 2,000 years condemning this glorious moment , well , that 's a mystery . I want to confront that , I suppose , by telling a story that this so-called original sin is anything but . It 's the thing that makes us fully human . " Pullman gets annoyed whenever he recalls a passage in C. S. Lewis 's Chronicles of Narnia : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Pevensie , the oldest sister , from what is essentially Paradise because she is " interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations . " Pullman , in an essay called " The Dark Side of Narnia , " cites this as evidence that Lewis disliked women and sexuality and was " frightened and appalled at the notion of wanting to grow up . " The Narnia series , in his view , embraces a worldview that comes close to " life-hating ideology " - punishing , misogynistic , racist , and death-obsessed . By contrast , his own books are filled with a kind of warmth , an exuberance for finding Utopia in this life . When he loses patience with his Christian critics , he lists the values he promotes in his own stories : tolerance , love , kindness , courage , duty , individual freedom over blind obedience . The series ends with Lyra realizing she has to return to her world and separate from Will . She is heartbroken , but accepts that this is the only way she can fulfill her ultimate destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven . " She understands this to be a paradise on Earth where she can learn to be " kind and curious and patient , " and where she can rely on her own knowledge and wisdom , not the mandates of God or the Magisterium . This reads as a moment of heroic idealism , one that not so subtly mocks the whole notion of a Kingdom of Heaven that rules and oppresses us while we live , and from which we are excluded until after we die . In 2002 , New Line commissioned the English playwright Tom Stoppard to write the screenplay for The Golden Compass . As a playwright , Stoppard is drawn to the dark and philosophical . His biggest success in Hollywood came from co-writing a comedy ( Shakespeare in Love ) , which The Golden Compass is decidedly not . So New Line should not have been surprised by the outcome . In its choice of villains , Stoppard 's script stays relatively faithful to Pullman . The script introduces Father MacPhail , an odious clergyman with a lizard daemon , who in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MacPhail and other clerics gather to discuss Dust and heresy . Stoppard told The New York Times that he turned in the script in 2003 and did n't hear back from the studio for quite some time . Ultimately , New Line decided the script was " too intellectual , " and " not Lyra-centric enough . " Stoppard " was interested in the discussions between old men with beards , " Pullman told me , " and those discussions are only important in how they affect Lyra . " In 2004 , while it was sitting on Stoppard 's script , the studio received an unsolicited 40-page adaptation plan from the screenwriter and director Chris Weitz . Given his rsum , Weitz was an unlikely candidate . He was best known for directing , with his brother , Paul , the raunchy teenage comedy American Pie . He also co-directed and co-wrote About a Boy ( based on the Nick Hornby novel ) , which was nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay . Although The Golden Compass was on an entirely different scale , Weitz made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had attended an " Oxbridge College , " in his case , Trinity College , Cambridge , where he 'd studied 17th-century literature and Milton 's Paradise Lost . A friend had given Pullman 's books to Weitz while he was fihningAbout a Boy , and when he imagined them onscreen , they seemed to him " everything I loved about moviemaking . " He loved the combination of epic adventure and coming-of-age story ; in the books , the drama comes as much from Lyra 's learning her true identity as it does from the battle scenes . He loved that the hero was a girl who was stubborn and defiant . And he loved that even the battles seemed beautiful and elegant , not " bunches of armies hacking at each other . " The studio reportedly called Stoppard and told him not to do any more work on the script . Weitz got the job as writer and director , and immediately set out to prove to Pullman 's devoted fan base that he deserved it . In December 2004 , before he 'd started filming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pullman fan site . Weitz was intelligent expansive , self-deprecating , and honest . The interview turned out to be a fiasco : BRIDGETOTHESTARS.NET : Do you think any of the more controversial aspects of HDM ( like the portrayal of religion ) will be toned down or removed altogether ? CHRIS WEITZ : Here we are at the heart of the matter . This will certainly be the issue that will ignite the most controversy amongst fans and amongst the general public ... New Line is a company that makes films for economic returns . You would hardly expect them to be anything else . They have expressed worry about the possibility of HDM 's perceived antireligiosity making it an unviable project financially ... Needless to say , all my best efforts will be directed towards keeping HDM as liberating and iconoclastic an experience as I can . But there may be some modification of terms . You will probably not hear of the " Church " but you will hear of the Magisterium . Those who will understand will understand . I have no desire to change the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may appear in more subtle guises . " Economic returns . " " Unviable project financially . " This is not the kind of boardroom blather a fan committed to the darkest side of His Dark Materials wants to hear . The message boards quickly soured on Weitz . " Like it or lump it , Pullman 's atheism is an integral part of his novels , " one fan wrote . " I 'm led to assume that Weitz is n't currently pursuing a career in spin only because he 's crap at it , " sneered another . The Times of London ran a story headlined " God Is Cut From Film of Dark Materials . " Weitz had believed that his ( safe ) take on Pullman 's theology-the Magisterium represents an oppressive theocracy or a totalitarian state , not religion in general-was widely shared . He had n't quite realized that the loudest part of Pullman 's fan base regarded that interpretation as a cop-out . These fans were committed to the broader interpretation of the villain 's identity as God himself . In their defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who missed the earlier hints , in the final book : " The Authority , God , the Creator , the Lord , Yahweh , El , Adonai , the King , the Father , the Almighty-those were all names he gave himself . " Weitz told me that after reading the Times story , he went into a cold sweat . " Why am I doing this ? " he remembered thinking . " I 'll end up being hated by the fans and ripped into by the press . And this is a huge , huge endeavor . Maybe this is n't for me . " All of a sudden , he felt overwhelmed by all of it : the visual effects , the cost and scope of the project . Only a short time after Weitz got his dream directing job , he backed out of it . In 2005 , the studio hired the British director Anand Tucker , best known for directing Shopgirl . In under a year , Tucker too was gone ( " Creative differences , " the studio said ) . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to become the director again . By then , he told me , " I 'd started to care less about what people might think of me . " Besides , he added , " This thing about the books being antireligion is a bit of a canard . They are , in fact , very spiritual . " Studios usually try to maintain good relations with authors , especially when an author has a large fan base . When Weitz came back to the project , he took comfort in an e-mail exchange he had with Pullman . He had asked him whether a " version that was n't superficially so much a critique of organized dogmatic religions would fly with him , " and Pullman , Weitz reported , " did n't seem particularly bothered by that . " Pullman has at times offered up a similar interpretation of his work , calling Soviet Russia , for example , a form of theocracy : " They start with a Holy Book that 's inerrant , in that case the writings of Marx , " he told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a priesthood that has privileges not afforded to common people . They have a teleological view of history moving inexorably to a certain point . They have demons , who are called traitors . So are there examples of the Magisterium in the secular world ? Of course . " But when I asked whether he considered this a limited interpretation of his views and not the " heart of the matter , " he smiled mischievously and suggested I put down , " Pullman nodded enthusiastically . " The heart of the matter is introduced at the end of the first book and is critical to the progression of the rest of the series . It was in the earliest versions of the movie script but over time it has been slowly erased . In the book , Lord Asriel , an enigmatic explorer , lectures Lyra on the story of Adam and Eve . In Lyra and Asriel 's world , the story goes : " And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of one 's daemon , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat . " According to Western religions , human history began with the Creation . But the cruel world as we know it began with the moment when Eve ate the fruit and then gave it to Adam . This is the Fall , which brought on sin and suffering . Adam and Eve were cursed by God and expelled from Eden . ( The full consequences of their act are laid out in a photo display at the new creationist museum in Kentucky : viruses , death , war , concentration camps , and starvation in Sudan . ) Asriel is unsettled by this interpretation of history . Over time , witches reveal that Lyra 's destiny is to replay the Eve story and undo original sin . Lyra fulfills this destiny in the third novel when she does whatever she does with Will . For the purpose of streamlining the plot the reversed Eve story is perfect : simple , elegant , and accessible . And , as Pullman points out , it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need that explanation . " But no $180 million movie is going to trash the first book of the Bible , so the movie will have to do without it . The earlier scripts made passing reference to the Fall . In the Stoppard script , Asriel , in a rage about the Authority , mocks the " apple of desire " and the " fig-leaf of shame " ; a few scenes later Coulter , the evil Nicole Kidman character , yells at Asriel , " You ca n't conquer God ! " Weitz told me he 'd originally written an opening scene showing Lyra in a college chapel listening to a sermon about the alternative Genesis , " but that movie was not going to get made . " A Weitz script dated December 2004 makes no explicit reference to Genesis . Instead , the theology is mediated entirely through a discussion of Dust , which , according to your taste , is either more highbrow or just more muddled . Asriel tells Lyra that people believe Dust is sin and that it brings on misery . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of original sin : " When I do-pain , sin , suffering-death itself will die . " The final , shooting script includes no mention of sin or the end of death . As Emmerich told me , Dust is " akin to the Force " in Star Wars . Coulter tells Lyra that Dust is " evil and wicked " and makes people " sick . " Asriel sounds like Obi-Wan Kenobi : " They taught themselves to fear Dust , instead of master it , " he says . " They 've ignored a tremendous source of power ... That is what it all comes down to , Lyra . That is what Dust is . Power . Without it , we are like children before the might of the Magisterium . " It may make sense if you 're in a dark room dazzled by special effects and not thinking too hard . Then again , maybe it wo n't . What 's left of Pullman 's story is a string of disconnected proclamations that obscure not just his original point , but any point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake ! " " We 're not alone . We 're never alone ! We have each other . " They satisfy , but they do n't really explain . Or perhaps they offer explanations so familiar and straightforward that they do n't invite questions . This is Hollywood at its most hazily indignant and self-congratulatory , recycling the generic theme of Victory , One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , Dead Poets Society , and countless other films-a band of grubby , half-crazed heroes takes on the System and wins . When I talked to Weitz in August , he expected that he would still be tinkering with the opening voice-over until just before the release , but the general direction was already set . New Line 's publicity materials describe it this way : " One child stands between the end of free will and the beginning of a new age . Lyra Belacqua ... is only 12 , but even she knows that doing what you 're told versus doing what you feel is right can yield very different outcomes . " The message is nominally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childlike innocence-which is one of his greatest complaints about religion . Weitz told me did n't make it . What can I say ? " Hollywood " is just terrified that anything that brings up religion or anything controversial will be disastrous . " But after three years of working on the movie , he 'd come up with a solid explanation for why he 's not selling out : In the ' ' 80s and ' ' 90s , Hollywood was " scornful in a very intellectually unsound way about religion . Any priest or nun was a dogmatic idiot . So I think there 's something valid in the way the Christian community has responded . " There will be some religious imagery in the movie , Weitz said , but it will be blended so unobtrusively into the production design that it will take a " DVD player and working knowledge of Latin to decipher the symbols . " Outside the Magisterium buildings will be icons of Orthodox saints . Sprinkled around the movie will be Latin inscriptions from the Vulgate translation of the Bible , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tree of good and evil . " Kind of a little joke between me and me , " Weitz told me . Movies that deeply offend Christian sensibilities do get made from time to time : The Last Temptation of Christ , Dogma , and , last year , The Da Vinci Code , a major Sony release . The last one lends credence to Pullman 's idea that a faithful translation of his books could have been commercially viable . It 's possible that New Line 's executives once thought so too . New Line , after all , has a reputation for picking up edgy projects , like Boogie Nights and Se7en . When the studio bought the rights to The Golden Compass , in 2002 , it was flush with the success of The Lord of the Rings , and perhaps its leadership imagined making something less anodyne . If so , a more nervous mood has since prevailed . Pullman 's books never had as large a following in the United States as Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code . And with shape-shifting daemons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie 's production costs were enormous . New Line 's interim projects , meanwhile , met with mixed success . The studio reportedly has tense relations with its parent company , Time Warner , and may be in danger of losing its independence . That 's a lot of pressure , which would naturally lead you to call on the Force . Despite all of New Line 's efforts , the movie may stall be received as offensive in some communities , if only because of its association with the book . Catholic League , a watchdog group that monitors portrayals of the Catholic Church in the media , has printed thousands of copies of a 23-page booklet called " Golden Compass : Agenda Unmasked , " which it plans to distribute to reviewers and religious groups . " I do n't want Christians to be seduced by the idea that this is a great fairy-tale story to show your kids at Christmastime , " says Bill Donohue , the group 's president . " This is Hitchens taken to the kids , " he adds , referring to Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great . Donohue knows that the moviemakers decided on a " dumbed down " version of the villains , but he still plans to call for a boycott . " It 's a backdoor way of selling atheism , " he says . " Unsuspecting parents will take little Johnny to see the movie . Johnny likes the movie . Johnny gets the trilogy for Christmas . " But these days Hollywood just does n't make for a satisfying enemy in the culture war . After the amazing success of Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ , in 2004 , studios have at times tried to win over what they initially saw as an untapped Christian market . They 've arranged press junkets for Christian journalists and hired marketers to reach out to churches . ( New Line made a bid with The Nativity Story in 2006 , a prequel to The Passion . It bombed . ) Right now , the love affair is in limbo . After a rocky start , the studios now seem to view the Christian market as it would a difficult girlfriend : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your distance but still take pains not to irritate her . Marketing plans aside , New Line executives likely believe they were doing Pullman no great disservice by stripping out his theology and replacing it with some vague derivative of the Force . Values such as obedience , religious devotion , and chastity are so rare in Hollywood 's culture that they probably seem archaic and quaintcourtly rules that no one lives by anyway . Certainly not something to get exercised over . At the 2007 Cannes Film Festival , in a press conference with cast members of The Golden Compass , a reporter asked if there was any pressure to tone down the antiChristian elements of the story . It fell to the young Eva Green , the former Bond girl who plays the beautiful witch queen Serafina Pekkala , to answer . " I do n't know . I do n't know .

You know people love " Oh , my God , it 's anti-Christian . ' It 's not at all ; it 's highly spiritual . " Pity poor Green . This may have been her mangled attempt to follow orders . At the festival , the studio had delivered a sheet of talking points to the hotel room of at least one cast member , Sam Elliott , who plays a Texas aeronaut in the film . According to Elliott , the talking points instructed that if the question of Pullman 's religious views came up , the actors should just " avoid it and play stupid .

It went from being the capital of sin to Disneyland , and now it 's landed somewhere in between . It tries to keep the sins hidden away and outwardly present itself as a defender of American virtues : justice , individual freedom , and the power of one innocent soul to save the world . The Golden Compass should not offend , or be controversial at all , Weitz swears . It will certainly not heaven forbid , offer any critique of religion .
