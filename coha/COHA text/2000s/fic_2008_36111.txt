It was six o'clock on Valentine 's Day , an hour that should have marked the beginning of a celebration-the way it had when she and Robert were married . When Robert was alive . But tonight , on the most romantic day of the year , thirty-eight-year-old Anne Marie Roche was alone . Turning over the closed sign on the door of Blossom Street Books , she glanced at the Valentine 's display with its cutout hearts and pink balloons and the collection of romance novels she did n't read anymore . Then she looked outside . Streetlights flickered on as evening settled over the Seattle neighborhood . <p> The truth was , Anne Marie hated her life . Well , okay , hate was putting it too strongly . After all , she was healthy , reasonably young and reasonably attractive , financially solvent , and she owned the most popular bookstore in the area . But she did n't have anyone to love , anyone who loved her . She was no longer part of something larger than herself . Every morning when she woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she did n't think she 'd ever get accustomed to that desolate feeling . <p> Her husband had died nine months ago . So , technically , she was a widow , although she and Robert had been separated . But they saw each other regularly and were working on a reconciliation . <p> Then , suddenly , it was all over , all hope gone . Just when they were on the verge of reuniting , her husband had a massive heart attack . He 'd collapsed at the office and died even before the paramedics could arrive . <p> Anne Marie 's mother had warned her about the risks of marrying an older man , but fifteen years was n't that much older . Robert , charismatic and handsome , had been in his mid-forties when they met . They 'd been happy together , well matched in every way but one . <p> Anne Marie wanted a baby . <p> Robert had n't . <p> He 'd had a family-two children-with his first wife , Pamela , and was n't interested in starting a second one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his stipulation . At the time it had n't seemed important . She was madly in love with Robert-and then two years ago it hit her . This longing , this need for a baby , grew more and more intense , and Robert 's refusal became more adamant . His solution had been to buy her a dog she 'd named Baxter . Much as she loved her Yorkie , her feelings had n't changed . She 'd still wanted a baby . <p> The situation was n't helped by Melissa , Robert 's twenty-four-year-old daughter , who disliked Anne Marie and always had . Over the years Anne Marie had made many attempts to ease the tension between them , all of which failed . Fortunately she had a good relationship with Brandon , Robert 's son , who was five years older than his sister . <p> When problems arose in Anne Marie and Robert 's marriage , Melissa had n't been able to disguise her glee . Her stepdaughter seemed absolutely delighted when Robert moved out the autumn before last , seven months before his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to warrant such passionate loathing , other than to fall in love with Melissa 's father . She supposed the girl 's ardent hope that her parents would one day remarry was responsible for her bitterness . Every child wanted his or her family intact . And Melissa was a young teen when Anne Marie married Robert-a hard age made harder by the family 's circumstances . Anne Marie did n't blame Robert 's daughter , but his marriage to Pamela had been dead long before she entered the picture . Still , try as she might , Anne Marie had never been able to find common ground with Melissa . In fact , she had n't heard from her since the funeral . <p> Anne Marie opened the shop door as Elise Beaumont approached . Elise 's husband , Maverick , had recently passed away after a lengthy battle with cancer . In her mid-sixties , she was a retired librarian who 'd reconnected with her husband after nearly thirty years apart , only to lose him again after less than three . She was a slight , gray-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her features was softened by the sadness in her eyes . A frequent patron of the bookstore , she and Anne Marie had become friends during the months of Maverick 's decline . In many ways his death was a release , yet Anne Marie understood how difficult it was to let go of someone you loved . <p> " I was hoping you 'd come , " Anne Marie told her with a quick hug . She 'd closed the store two hours early , giving Steve Handley , her usual Thursday-night assistant , a free evening for his own Valentine celebration . <p> Elise slipped off her coat and draped it over the back of an over-stuffed chair . " I did n't think I would and then I decided that being with the other widows was exactly what I needed tonight . " <p> The widows . <p> They 'd met in a book group Anne Marie had organized at the store . After Robert died , she 'd suggested reading Lolly Winston 's Good Grief , a novel about a young woman adjusting to widowhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillie Higgins and Barbie Foster . Colette Blake had joined , too . She 'd been a widow who 'd rented the apartment above A Good Yarn , Lydia Goetz 's yarn store . Colette had married again the previous year . <p> Although the larger group had read and discussed other books , the widows had gravitated together and begun to meet on their own . Their sessions were often informal gatherings over coffee at the nearby French CafT or a glass of wine upstairs at Anne Marie 's . <p> Lillie and Barbie were a unique pair of widows , mother and daughter . They 'd lost their husbands in a private plane crash three years earlier . Anne Marie remembered reading about the Learjet incident in the paper ; both pilots and their two passengers had been killed in a freak accident on landing in Seattle . Lillie 's husband and son-in-law were executives at a perfume company and often took business trips together . <p> Lillie Higgins was close to Elise 's age , but that was all they shared . Actually , it was difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty , but with a forty-year-old daughter , she had to be in her mid-sixties . Petite and delicate , she was one of those rare women who never seemed to age . Her wardrobe consisted of ultra-expensive knits and gold jewelry . Anne Marie had the impression that if Lillie wanted , she could purchase this bookstore ten times over . <p> Her daughter , Barbie Foster , was a lot like her mother and aptly named , at least as far as appearances went . She had long blond hair that never seemed to get mussed , gorgeous crystal-blue eyes , a flawless figure . It was hard to believe she had eighteen-year-old twin sons who were college freshmen ; Anne Marie would bet that most people assumed she was their sister rather than their mother . If Anne Marie did n't like Barbie so much , it would be easy to resent her for being so ... perfect . <p> " Thanks for closing early tonight . I 'd much rather be here than spend another evening alone , " Elise said , breaking into Anne Marie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alone . <p> Despite her own misgivings about Valentine 's Day , Anne Marie tried to smile . She gestured toward the rear of the store . " I 've got the bubble wrap and everything set up in the back room . " <p> The previous month , as they discussed an Elizabeth Buchan novel , the subject of Valentine 's Day had come up . Anne Marie learned from her friends that this was perhaps the most painful holiday for widows . That was when their small group decided to plan their own celebration . Only instead of romantic love and marriage , they 'd celebrate friendship . They 'd defy the world 's pitying glances and toast each other 's past loves and future hopes . <p> Elise managed a quivering smile as she peered into the back of the store . " Bubble wrap ? " <p> " I have tons , " Anne Marie informed her . " You ca n't imagine how many shippers use it . " <p> " But why is it on the floor ? " <p> " Well ... " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I always have this insatiable urge to pop it , so I thought we could do it together-by walking on it . " <p> " You want us to step on bubble wrap ? " Elise asked , sounding confused . <p> " Think of it as our own Valentine 's dance and fireworks in one . " <p> " But fireworks are for Independence Day or maybe New Year 's . " <p> " That 's the point , " Anne Marie said bracingly . " New beginnings . " <p> " And we 'll drink champagne , too ? " <p> " You bet . I 've got a couple bottles of the real stuff , Veuve Clicquot . " <p> " Veuve means widow , you know . The widow Clicquot 's bubbly-what else could we possibly drink ? " <p> The door opened , and Lillie and Barbie entered in a cloud of some elegant scent . As soon as they were inside , Anne Marie locked the shop . <p> " Party time , " Lillie said , handing Anne Marie a white box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barbie announced , holding up a box of dark Belgian chocolates . She wore a red pantsuit with a wide black belt that emphasized her petite waist . Was there no justice in this world ? The woman had the figure of a goddess and she ate chocolate ? <p> " I read that dark chocolate and red wine have all kinds of natural benefits , " Elise said . <p> Anne Marie had read that , too . <p> Lillie shook her head in mock astonishment . " First wine and now chocolate . Life is good . " <p> Leading the way to the back room , Anne Marie dimmed the lights in the front of the shop . Beside the champagne and flutes , she 'd arranged a crystal vase of red roses ; they 'd been a gift from Susannah 's Garden , the flower shop next door . All the retailers on Blossom Street were friends . Hearing about the small party , Alix Turner from the French CafT had dropped off a tray of cheese , crackers and seedless green grapes , which Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lacy cloth . Lydia had insisted they use it for their celebration . It was so beautiful it reawakened Anne Marie 's desire to learn to knit . <p> She wished she could see her friends ' gifts as more than expressions of sympathy , but her state of mind made that impossible . Still , because of the other widows , for their sake as well as her own , she was determined to try . <p> " This is going to be fun , " Elise said , telling them why Anne Marie had spread out the bubble wrap . <p> " What a wonderful idea ! " Barbie exclaimed . <p> " Shall I pour ? " Anne Marie asked , ignoring the sense of oppression she could n't seem to escape . It had been present for months and she 'd thought life would be better by now . Perhaps she needed counseling . One thing was certain ; she needed something . <p> " By all means , " Lillie said , motioning toward the champagne . Anne Marie opened the bottle and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking the rims of the flutes . <p> " To love , " Elise said . " To Maverick . " Her voice broke . <p> " To chocolate ! " Barbie made a silly face , perhaps to draw attention away from Elise 's tears . <p> " And the Widow 's champagne , " Lillie threw in . <p> Anne Marie remained silent . <p> Although it 'd been nine months , her grief did n't seem to diminish or become any easier to bear . She worked too much , ate too little and grieved for all the might-have-beens . It was more than the fact that the man she 'd loved was dead . With his death , she was forced to give up the dream of all she 'd hoped her marriage would be . A true companionship-and the foundation of a family . Even if she were to fall in love again , which seemed unlikely , a pregnancy past the age of forty was risky . The dream of having her own child had died with Robert . <p> The four sipped their champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anne Marie saw the sorrow on Elise 's face , the contemplative look on Lillie 's , Barbie 's half smile . <p> " Will we be removing our shoes in order to pop the bubble wrap ? " Lillie asked a moment later . <p> " Mom has this thing about walking around in stocking feet , " Barbie said , glancing at her mother . " She does n't approve . " <p> " It just was n't done in our household , " Lillie murmured . <p> " There 's no reason to take our shoes off , " Anne Marie said . " The whole idea is to have fun . Make a bit of noise , celebrate our friendship and our memories . " <p> " Then I say , let ' er rip , " Elise said . She raised her sensibly shod foot and stomped on a bubble . A popping sound exploded in the room . <p> Barbie went next , her step firm . Her high heels effectively demolished a series of bubbles . <p> Pop . Pop . Pop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentative , almost apologetic . <p> Pop . <p> Anne Marie went last . It felt ... good . Really good , and the noise only added to the unexpected sense of fun and exhilaration . For the first time since the party had begun , she smiled . <p> By then they were all flushed with excitement and champagne . The others were laughing giddily ; Anne Marie could n't quite manage that but she could almost laugh . The ability to express joy had left her when Robert died . That was n't all she 'd lost . She used to sing , freely and without self-consciousness . But after Robert 's funeral Anne Marie discovered she could n't sing anymore . She just could n't . Her throat closed up whenever she tried . What came out were strangled sounds that barely resembled music , and after a while she gave up . It 'd been months since she 'd even attempted a song . <p> The popping continued as they paraded around on the bubble wrap , pausing now and then to sip champagne . They marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saluting one another with their champagne flutes . <p> Thanks to her friends , Anne Marie found that her mood had begun to lift . <p> Soon all the bubbles were popped . Bringing their champagne , they sat in the chairs where the reader groups met and toasted each other again in the dimly lit store . <p> Leaning back , Anne Marie tried to relax . Despite her earlier laughter , despite spending this evening with friends , her eyes filled with tears . She blinked them away , but new tears came , and it was n't long before Barbie noticed . Her friend placed a reassuring hand on Anne Marie 's knee . <p> " Does it ever hurt any less ? " Anne Marie asked . Searching for a tissue in her hip pocket , she blotted her eyes . She hated breaking down like this . She wanted to explain that she 'd never been a weepy or sentimental woman . All her emotions had become more intense since Robert 's death . <p> Lillie and Barbie exchanged knowing looks . They 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillie promised her , growing serious , too . " But it takes time . " <p> " I feel so alone . " <p> " That 's to be expected , " Barbie said , passing her the box of chocolates . " Here , have another one . You 'll feel better . " <p> " That 's what my grandmother used to say , " Elise added . " Eat , and everything will seem better . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
