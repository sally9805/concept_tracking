<p> When state Democratic leaders from around the country meet this weekend in Vermont , the California chairman , Art Torres , expects to be peppered with the sort of questions that have been clogging his in-box for weeks . <p> What is this about Republicans trying to change the way Electoral College votes are allocated in California ? Is there a countereffort by Democrats in the works ? What does it mean for presidential candidates ? <p> Frustrated by a system that has marginalized many states in the presidential election process , or seeking partisan advantage , state lawmakers , political party leaders and voting rights advocates across the country are stepping up efforts to change the rules of the game , even as the presidential campaign advances . <p> In California , this has led to a nascent Republican bid to apportion the state 's electoral votes by Congressional district , not by statewide vote , in a move that most everyone agrees would benefit Republican candidates . Democrats in North Carolina are mulling a similar move , because it would help Democrats there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also led to a game of leapfrog in the scheduling of presidential primary and caucus dates . Most recently , on Thursday , Republicans in South Carolina moved their primary to January from February to get ahead of Florida 's . <p> Further , there is a germinal movement to effectively abolish the Electoral College , awarding the White House instead to the winner of the national popular vote . Maryland recently became the first state to have such legislation passed and then signed into law , although legislatures in several other states have passed similar measures . <p> " There are different political fires all over the place , " Mr. Torres said . " We felt before that we would try and maintain some order and discipline , but it has been difficult to do . This all portends a strong initiative by states to exert more power . " <p> Each maneuver , which experts on electoral politics agree could radically change the political landscape or , just as easily , completely wash out , has added a generous dose of unpredictability to an already knotty federal election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is happening , " said Bill Burton , a spokesman for Senator Barack Obama 's presidential campaign . " It 's a reality that we have to deal with , but the people on the ground have their heads down and are working as hard as they can . " <p> The states ' efforts reflect a momentum outside Washington to " get a system that reflects public preferences , " said George C. Edwards III , a professor of political science at Texas A &M; University . Elected officials , state party leaders and many voters have grown weary of a system in which " candidates focus on 13 or 14 states and no other states get attention , except for fund-raising , " Professor Edwards said . <p> In 2004 , 13 states with 159 electoral votes among them were considered " in play , " according to FairVote , a voting rights organization ; in 1988 , there were 21 such states and 272 electoral votes . <p> The interest in changing the way the president is elected was largely seeded by Democrats after the 2000 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We have discovered what our founding fathers learned as well , which is that you can manipulate election outcomes by setting those rules , " said Michael P. McDonald , an associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University . <p> In the last legislative session , lawmakers in eight states considered bills that would give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote rather than the presidential candidate chosen by state voters ; the measures would take effect only if states representing a majority of the 538 electoral votes made the same change . <p> " The idea of the states banding together and being able to set the rules of the game to directly elect the president is a new idea , " said Pete Maysmith , the national director of state campaigns for Common Cause , which advocates a national popular vote . " And I think it is grabbing people 's attention and gaining momentum . " <p> Far more potentially significant in the near term , however , is a recent move by the lawyer for the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apportion electoral votes by Congressional district . With numerous safe Republican districts around the state , this change could represent roughly 20 electoral votes for a Republican candidate who would otherwise presumably lose the entire state , which has been reliably Democrat in recent presidential elections . <p> " We think it is the most effective way of having California count , " said Kevin Eckery , a spokesman for the ballot effort , the Presidential Election Reform Act . " Candidates love California in the spring when they come out to raise money . But after that , as long as California is not in play , it tends to be ignored . " <p> Mr. Eckery said that polling on the issue would cost $300,000 to $500,000 , and gaining enough signatures to get the initiative on the June 2008 state ballot would cost a few million dollars more . Fund-raising has already begun , and proponents and opponents of the measure believe the effort will attract ample donors . <p> While assigning electoral votes by Congressional district is a movement lacking broad national support , both Republicans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam , other states might consider it as well , if for no other reason than to counter the anticipated Republican gains here . Only Maine and Nebraska currently use such a system . <p> Had the electoral votes been allocated by Congressional district nationwide in 2000 , President Bush 's electoral margin of victory would have been just over 7 percent , or eight times his take that year , according to FairVote . <p> If the California measure succeeds , " it would make it impossible for a Democrat to win the White House " in a close election , predicted Steve Schmidt , a Republican consultant who ran Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger 's most recent campaign in California and has been an adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona . <p> Democrats and other interest groups have already promised to take steps to defeat such a proposal . <p> In the North Carolina legislature , Democrats nearly signed off on a similar measure this summer , until the national party chairman , Howard Dean , stepped in to get the issue tabled @ @ @ @
