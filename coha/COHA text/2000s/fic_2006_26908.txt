Victoria was reading the enormous book their landlady on Greene Street kept in her parlor . She was lying in bed with her temporary lover , Charlie , who was sleeping in on his back , snoring lightly . She doubted anybody else had bothered with the book , for some pages were still uncut  --  the Orations of Demosthenes , a great Greek speaker Victoria had begun to dream about since she and her sister arrived in New York . She could see him clearly at times and once in a while she began to hear his voice addressing her , a deep , resonant voice that thrilled her . She had seen visions and heard voices since she was a child . The same was true of her sister Tennessee , but Tennie was willing to fake it on demand , while Victoria refused . She considered herself chosen for some high magnificent fate . If life so far had been hard and sordid at times , she knew it was all about to change . She could feel it . Her voices strengthened her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A telegram from her husband Colonel James Blood lay on the night table . In two days , he was joining the sisters in New York . She knew it was only a matter of time before the rest of her Claflin clan found them . Money , they always needed money . Her father Buck had taken her on the revival circuit since she was old enough to stand , project her voice and fascinate a crowd ; then Tennie with her clairvoyant act had taken over . The family cooked up patent medicines and practiced magnetic healing . Both sisters were good at the laying on of hands , which might prove useful if their plans , worked out in the Midwest , came to fruition  --  as they must . The sisters and James had carefully studied Cornelius Vanderbilt , as much as they could learn from a distance . He was their best hope . Charlie was stirring . She put the leather-bound book beside the bed , half pushing it under . He was a reporter on the Sun whom she had run into at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city  --  the Tweed ring , the flavor of the different newspapers , the scandals , where the wealthy lived , rode in their carriages , ate . He had served as a correspondent the last year of the Civil War , but now he reported on politics . His limp ginger hair falling over his high forehead , he snuggled into the pillows with a wide yawn that showed his plentiful gold teeth . She was not tremendously moved by Charlie  --  as a lover he lacked talent  --  but he had much to teach her . She wanted to keep him as a friend . When she was sure she had his attention , she touched the telegram and sighed heavily . " What 's wrong ? Bad news in the telegram ? " She handed it to Charlie , saying nothing . " Oh , rot . That is bad news . But maybe you can get away sometimes ? There are some very pleasant houses of assignation I use sometimes . " " Let me see how things work out . Perhaps after a while . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone interested in Tennessee . That would make things easier for us . " She had not lied . If she told the truth , that she and James believed in free love , her lack of sexual interest might hurt Charlie 's feelings . She genuinely liked him , but there was no spark . He was too plodding a lover , with  --  as was the case with so many men  --  no understanding of a woman 's body . They did not know how to find , let alone stimulate , a woman 's spot for pleasure . Fortunately , he had to run off to work . Tennie was waiting in the hall for him to leave . " Listen , I met the most wonderful woman last night . " Tennie looked absolutely radiant . Her beauty was quite different from Victoria 's own  --  not that she was vain , but being beautiful had clear advantages . Victoria 's face was chiseled , refined . Her hair was dark and her complexion fair . Tennie was voluptuous and high-colored , with auburn hair and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All seven Claflin children had different appearances , although there was no doubt with their hyperreligious mother Roxanne that Buck was the father . He was n't faithful , but Victoria was certain their mother was . Roxanne might be considered touched , as people said , but she had managed to feed them all under hellish circumstances , and she had loved them in her own way . She had never denied their gifts . Nor had Buck . He simply exploited them . " So tell me about this woman . " Victoria sat on her bed , mending a peacock blue frock of Tennie 's . Victoria liked to wear black while her sister went in for vivid colors . Victoria sewed well  --  in fact she had tried to make a living at it in San Francisco , but it paid so poorly , she had gone on the stage instead . Tennie paced back and forth in her chemise , crinoline and corset that pushed her breasts high  --  up and out . " Annie Wood . She runs an elegant whorehouse on Thirty-fourth Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich fast , because the toffs talk about the stocks and their investments . Annie chats them up and has her girls do the same , then she invests . It 's a place the girls are treated swell , Vickie . You have to meet her . She 's sharp . " " Maybe today . The Colonel is coming tomorrow . " Victoria 's second husband had been a real colonel in the Union army during the Civil War , and he had the wounds to show for it . He had returned from the wars scarred both inwardly and outwardly , uncomfortable in his life and no longer able to enjoy sex with his wife . He had come to see Victoria in her professional capacity as a magnetic healer about his headaches and had confessed his problems to her . The moment he had walked into the parlor where she was receiving patients , she had jumped as if something hot had been driven into her . . . Continues ...                 @ @ @ @
