<p> Each Monday afternoon , Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell and first-year quarterbacks coach Bill Lazor head to the deserted practice fields at Redskins Park to review the meticulous footwork of the Redskins ' new offense , refining every precise pivot and swivel of the hips . For months they have met alone on a day when the team 's practice facility is largely empty . Just a player , a coach , a football , a massive playbook and a vast potential they hope to fulfill . <p> After watching from the sideline as a rookie in 2005 , Campbell , 24 , is positioned to push for the backup job behind veteran Mark Brunell this season , and , should Brunell get injured , perhaps make his NFL debut . <p> As the Redskins begin their offseason workouts this week , culminating in next month 's minicamp , all eyes will be on Campbell . The Redskins made a hefty investment to acquire Campbell last year , trading three picks , including a first rounder , to make him the 25th selection overall in the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the playbook , sequestering himself in the film room and absorbing as much information from coaches and teammates as possible . <p> Getting Campbell ready to contribute in 2006 will not be easy . For the sixth straight year  --  dating from his freshman season at Auburn  --  he is being required to learn a new offense . He is working with his sixth quarterbacks coach and , with the hiring of Al Saunders from the Kansas City Chiefs in January , his sixth offensive coordinator . While the terminology of Coach Joe Gibbs 's and Saunders 's offenses are similar , the requirements of the quarterbacks and receivers this season will be quite different . <p> The " Mondays with Billy " sessions are but one part of Campbell 's development . Campbell has had individual tutoring from Saunders as well , he throws to receivers informally whenever possible and has been at Redskins Park religiously since the season ended in January . He returned home to Mississippi for just two weeks before heading back to Loudoun County . <p> Most nights are spent poring over plays and formations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at least four days a week . The Redskins ' growing playbook , which spans the 6-foot-4 quarterback 's prodigious forearm , is his constant fashion accessory . <p> " We 'll go out to get a bite to eat a lot , because we do n't cook , but Jason spends most of his time in that playbook , " said cornerback Carlos Rogers , Campbell 's teammate at Auburn who lives two houses from him now . " All that guy does is go home after his workout and study . He puts in serious hours , but they 've got a new offense and the quarterbacks are the leaders of the offense , so he has to put in his time . Jason 's a smart guy , and he knows how hard he has to work . " <p> Gibbs , Saunders and Lazor admit that it is impossible to determine when Campbell will master the offense and merit regular playing time , but the offseason workouts and preseason will provide a clue about his development . Gibbs has said that Campbell will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance then will be the best indicator of where he stands . The Redskins signed quarterback Todd Collins , a longtime Saunders disciple who understands the new offense , should Campbell fail to secure the backup position . But Gibbs says he remains upbeat about Campbell 's potential . <p> " He 's done it all through high school and done it all in college , and we think he 's going to do it all up here , " Gibbs said . " I think it 's a process for a young guy to come along , and I think he knows now , last year was one set of circumstances where you know you 're probably not going to play , and this year he knows it 's a different deal . He 's going to be getting a lot of focus , a lot of attention and a lot of playing time , and we 're excited about getting him in there and letting him go to work . " <p> Before then , however , Campbell must once again learn a new offense . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Lazor , who was a quarterback at Cornell and coached the position in college . " For Jason to walk in this building with a smile on his face says a lot about his disposition , because some days I 'm sure he 's thinking , ' Here we go again . ' " <p> Indeed , this is a chore Campbell knows all too well . <p> " Sometimes I think about all the things I overcame to get to this point  --  all the different changes and offenses  --  and you always wonder how much better do you think you could be if you were just in one offense , " Campbell said . " But everything happens for a reason , and we 're glad to have Coach Saunders . He 's a great coach , and I think once I learn his whole offense I 'll have the opportunity to be a great quarterback here . " <p> To do so , Campbell must become fluent in all of Saunders 's plays and be able to execute them with speed , authority and dexterity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take short drop-backs on pass plays , read the defense quickly to determine who is open and then pass the ball to a spot , rather than to a receiver 's hands . The quarterback must throw the ball before the receiver 's cut in his route , requiring precise timing . <p> " There 's no question about what Jason can do with his arm , " wide receiver Santana Moss said . " But grasping this offense , and knowing where he needs to be with the ball and when it has to be there , that 's going to be his issue . And once he gets that , he should be all right . " <p> Saunders said the repeated coaching changes Campbell has endured have deprived him of developing " a real solid base with which to work from in a fundamental and technique standpoint . " He must smooth those rough edges while also trying to digest the team 's expansive playbook . <p> " The quarterbacks that have played in this system have had a very high football aptitude , " Saunders said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to retain and gather information , because this offense builds and builds and builds , and part of the success we 've had on offense is the versatility and volume we have . We go into a game with 250 , 300 plays , and that changes every single week and multiplies itself through the course of a year . It 's a lot of timing . It 's rhythm . The game is played at a very , very , fast , upbeat tempo , and all of those things begin with the quarterback . " <p> Brunell , 35 , is adjusting as well , but he has 147 games of regular season experience and deep knowledge to draw from . Collins , 34 , is a Saunders favorite even though he has made just 17 starts since 1995 . " Todd is as good a technician as there is in this passing game , " Saunders said . " He just has n't had a chance to play because Chiefs Pro Bowl starter Trent Green was always healthy . " <p> Collins and Campbell are paired together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefty  --  so Campbell can learn from the veteran . Campbell also can turn to Collins with questions about the offense , and about the preparation necessary to be a No. 2 quarterback . Should Campbell get a chance to play this season , he said he aims to make the most of it . The results may be slow to come at first , he said , but over time  --  and with the luxury of continuity in one offense  --  Campbell is confident that he will succeed . <p> " Everyone has their ups and downs , " Campbell said . " If you think about Peyton Manning , when he started he was 3-13 and took a lot of lumps and lot of licks in the mouth , and now you look at him and he 's probably the best quarterback in the NFL . So guys take their lumps early in the careers , but it all prepares you for the future . You 've got to take it in stride and you 've got to understand that you 're going to make good plays and bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of getting better . "
