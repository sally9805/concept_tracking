JACKIE O. 'S GENERATION MADE HIM A STAR , BUT ASHLEY JUDD , NICOLE KIDMAN , AND THE BELLES OF EUROPE KEEP HIS RED-HOT FLAME BURNING . VALENTINO CELEBRATES 40 YEARS OF GO-FOR-BROKE GLAMOUR . PHOTOGRAPHED BY ROBERT WYATT // " Foooorty years , " Valentino says slowly . " Can you imagine ? How time fliiiies . " How it does indeed . From the moment in 1959 when he posed with Princess Luciana Pignatelli for the cover of an Italian magazine , Valentino has been the designer who offers a chic glamour to film stars , royalty , and the rich elite . To look at him , the Sheik of Chic ( as he was proclaimed in 1968 ) has n't really changed : The heavy-lidded eyes are as blue ; his frame is as slim ; his tan as perpetual . On his head , no hair is out of place ( it never is , even on his yacht when a full gale is blowing ) . Yet Valentino is celebrating-most recently at a haute Hollywood benefit-four full decades in fashion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris ( to the designers Jean Desses and Guy Laroche ) , which is rarisimo for an Italian couturier ? Valentino thinks not . Rather , he suggests , it is his persistent focus on making women look beautiful . " When I drape materials , when I do something for evening or daytime or for cocktail , " he insists , " I try . " There 's also his relentless concern about elegance . He actually winces at the mention of minimalism , waifdom , or grunge . Like Coco Chanel , he believes that knees should never be shown-except by young women blessed with model-like proportions . " It looks so vulgar ; " orrible , " orrible , " orrible , " he clucks . In many ways , Valentino 's high standards have helped him withstand the fickleness of time and fashion . In the ' ' 60s , at the height of Rome 's dolce vita , Sophia Loren was a loyal attendee of all his shows ; Marella Agnelli wore Valentino to Truman Capote 's infamous Black and White Ball ; and Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined his client list . However , it was the other most famous woman in the world who launched Valentino internationally . When Jackie Kennedy married Aristotle Onassis in 1968 and chose to wear Valentino 's dress , his sketch was shown on television news programs all over the world . " I saw a minimum 30 custom-made versions of this dress , " he recalls . Mrs. Onassis remained a loyal client for the rest of her life . " Really , " he says , " I did hundreds and hundreds of dresses for her . " Other avid Valentino fans of her generation-all style sirens-included Audrey Hepburn , Gloria Guinness , Babe Paley , and , during her White House years , Nancy Reagan . But today the designer is keen to press his new clientele . " I think it 's a good moment for fashion because the young discover beauty , " he declares . He senses that the recent rage for vintage has helped because " when they see the old dresses with embroidery , " they understand quality . A few weeks earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very proud and very grateful because I am not a designer who just makes clothes for women of 60 . " At Oscar time , Valentino is worn by a slew of stars-Ashley Judd , Nicole Kidman , and Sharon Stone , to name a few . As he speaks , extensive preparations are being made downstairs for the afternoon 's fashion shoot . Valentino is going to be photographed with a new generation of ladies including Hannah McGibbon ( his elf-like assistant ) and four socially connected Europeans : Princess Mafalda von Hessen , Daphne Niarchos , Tamara Mellon , and Normandie White . Primped and preened , they glow like picture-book fairy princesses . As soon as he sees them , Valentino breaks into a warm smile . Forty years on , and he 's still not blase about seeing his dresses . " You know , the fact is that I 'm an old fox , " he remarks . " I am in this business for a looong time . I know exactly what to do . Is experience . " Photograph CHIC CLIQUE Valentino with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Hessen , Normandie White , Daphne Niarchos , and Tamara Mellon .
