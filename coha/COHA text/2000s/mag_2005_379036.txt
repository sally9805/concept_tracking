Of all the costs of new parenthood  --  stretch marks , lost sleep , depleted funds  --  the most traumatic is to one 's ears . You spend years curating a hip CD collection , then  --  wham !  --  your life becomes a death march down the Barney highway . Here are half a dozen kids ' albums you 'll be proud to blast out your minivan windows . <P> THE INNOCENCE MISSION : NOW THE DAY IS OVER " It 'll put you to sleep " is not the kind of rave most musicians seek . But it 's praise for these sparely arranged , lullaby-like songs . The selections of classical pieces and standards can be a little obvious ( What a Wonderful World , Over the Rainbow ) , but the execution is hypnotic . Singer Karen Peris ( who wrote the lovely original My Love Goes with You ) has a transporting quaver that makes this bedtime disc positively sopor-riffic . <P> DAN ZANES AND FRIENDS : HOUSE PARTY The Muppet-haired guitarist of ' 80s indie-rock band the Del Fuegos now makes eclectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar ( Jamaica Farewell ) and the obscure ( the rollicking Tennessee Wig Walk ) with crafty originals , like the R &B-inflected; House Party Time . And the cast of surprise guests , such as Deborah Harry and Bob Weir , will give you an excuse to inflict Blondie and Grateful Dead albums on your children later . <P> RALPH 'S WORLD : THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KID ASTRO Imagine Ziggy Stardust  --  era David Bowie doing the theme for a Nickelodeon cartoon , and you 'll have the title track , a 3-min. rock operetta about a space boy who gets powers from a magic comet ( but still has to go to school ) . From there , alt rocker turned children 's rocker Ralph Covert runs through genres like a kid hitting every ride at a theme park : British Invasion backbeats , infectious Buddy Holly stomps and fanciful finger picking . <P> LAURIE BERKNER : UNDER A SHADY TREE If you 're Sting 's or Madonna 's child , you want Mom or Dad to play at your birthday party , right ? Wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheryl Crow , Berkner inhabits a kid 's curious perspective in her lyrics and pens folk-pop melodies that bear repeated  --  very repeated  --  listenings . <P> THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS : HERE COME THE ABCS This Brooklyn duo 's work for adults is arty and wacky  --  think Spike Jones with an M.F.A. degree . And TMBG 's album of alphabet songs is , well , pretty much the same . The loopy tracks  --  26 of ' em , of course  --  include the delicately pretty C Is for Conifers , the funk meltdown E Eats Everything and I C U , very likely the first-ever country ballad composed entirely of letters that sound like words ( " I C U/ I C U/ N U R O K " ) . U R O.K. 2 , TMBG . <P> VARIOUS ARTISTS : FOR THE KIDS TOO ! Proceeds from this kids ' alternative-rock collection benefit children with neurological disorders , but there are reasons other than charity to buy it . It combines playful tunes first recorded for grownups ( Robyn Hitchcock 's I Often Dream of Trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunting , mandolin-laced My Favorite Things by Winnipeg band Nathan ) . It 's a diverse hipster primer for your favorite alternatoddler.
