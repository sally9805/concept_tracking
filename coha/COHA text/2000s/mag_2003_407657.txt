" What is it ? " my nine-year-old son barks into the phone , followed by : " Nope , my mom 's in the shower . " He obviously felt this was more delicate than saying , " My mom 's on the toilet . " I heard him slam the phone down before yelling , " Mom ! Ann called about work . " " Oh great , " I thought , " a client . " And a nanosecond later : " Now which Ann would that be ? " As anyone who has ever operated a home-based business knows , children do not make the world 's most refined secretaries . Nonetheless , running a home business can offer some attractive perks to parents , including greater flexibility , reduced commuting time and additional tax write-offs . If you , too , dream of starting a home business , read on for some tips to increase your chances of success . AN HONEST APPRAISAL Before you even contemplate a home-based business , ask yourself : Can you work on your own ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stew in the oven while at work . But , as Lorne Peasland , founder of the Victoria-based online journal homebiznews.ca , points out , there will be no more chats by the water cooler . " I 've gone weeks on end without talking to anyone but my 14-year-old daughter , " he says . Graph Not Transcribed Home businesses are tough for procrastinators , too . " It 's easy to turn on the TV or surf the Net , " says Moe Somani , president and CEO of Vancouver 's SOHO Business Group , a networking organization for small biz owners . The entrepreneurs ' suggestions : To compensate for the lack of co-worker camaraderie , join an industry association , or find like-minded business folks to bounce ideas off . And overcome a tendency to dilly-dally by setting specific goals . " I have short-term and long-term revenue objectives , " says Somani . Another tip : Book appointments out of the house first thing in the morning to get your juices flowing , and get dressed for work , rather than sitting around in a housecoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep you disciplined and motivated , " Somani notes . TO MARKET , TO MARKET Think you 've got what it takes ? Make sure your business does , too . Simone Desjardins , Ontario senior vice-president , operation , for the Business Development Bank of Canada , suggests starting a business in an industry or service you know well . " It gives you an edge , " she says . Many home businesses grow out of a hobby , or a feeling that a specific need is n't being met . Wendy Kennedy , who lives on a farm south of Calgary , started her online catalogue , CanadianCountryGifts.com , four years ago because she liked handmade country-style items and found them hard to get in Canada . " The idea was to give Canadians access to the kind of stuff you only found in the US . " It took a few years to get the word out , but the business is finally beginning to break even and traffic on Kennedy 's Web site grows daily . The surprise : " A lot of my clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're starting from scratch , a little research can provide a lot of insight into whether there 's a demand for your business . Your local chamber of commerce , industry or trade associations , similar businesses in other communities and business directories are good places to start . Find out what the legal requirements are for starting your business ; who your potential customers and competitors are ; who your suppliers are and what they 're charging ; and whether your product offers some advantage over the others . THE BEST-LAID PLANS Most experts swear by a business plan . " It 's a blueprint to operate by , " says Carolynn Reid of the Small Business Enterprise Centre in Hamilton . And it should help you project your sales , budgets and cash flow . Outline your business 's objectives , Reid suggests , and why you think it 's viable . Then follow up with outlines of what you need to create your product or service , how you 're going to market it , deliver it and the associated expenses . Finally , look ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , five years and beyond ? " Many home-based businesspeople wo n't even think about having a business plan , " says Peasland . " But I think it 's helpful : You can refer back to it and it 's kind of like a push in the back : " I said I was going to do this and I have n't . I guess I should . " A ROOM OF ONE 'S OWN When you finally reach the set-up stage , the first thing you need is an office , preferably separate from your living space . " Ideally , you want to be away from distractions and close to the front door , " says Reid , " so if you have to see clients in your office , you do n't have to guide them through your whole house first . " Probably the worst place to put an office is the bedroom . " Most people who are self-employed live with the business on their minds 24/7 as it is , " she says . " Having a bedroom office just makes it worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your work life separate from the everyday routines of the home . " In my first year , my wife would phone me from work and say , " Can you move the laundry from the washer to the dryer ? ' " says Somani . " I had to make a point of saying , " You know what ? My office is at home , but when I 'm here , you have to act like I 'm not around . ' " EQUIP YOURSELF ... ON THE CHEAP The average person starts up a home business with $5,000 or less , according to Somani , yet it 's crucial to look professional . According to Staples/Business Depot , typical before-tax start-up costs include : Symbol Not Transcribed filled square business registration : $80 for five years ( in Ontario ) Symbol Not Transcribed filled square office supplies ( business cards , stationery , invoicing and record-keeping materials ) : $290 Symbol Not Transcribed filled square equipment ( two-line phone ; all-in-one **26;974;TOOLONG ; flat-screen computer ; Quicken software ) : $2,120 Symbol Not Transcribed filled square office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file cabinet ) : $340 to $590 Symbol Not Transcribed filled square any specific equipment you need to operate . Once you figure out your start-up costs , calculate how many sales you need to break even and where they 're going to come from . The lower your break-even point , the faster you can make a profit , so keep expenses low , suggests Reid . You can preserve cash flow by leasing equipment and buying support services , at least at the beginning . Not only do you not have to pay up front , you can also write off the entire lease expense . Another option : barter exchanges that allow you to swap business supplies or services ( see " Making the Net Work , " next page ) . YOUNG ASSISTANCE Child care is a must for most parents who work at home  --  at least if you 've got young children . If you ca n't afford or do n't want full-time daycare , try to arrange for a few hours at a stretch to get your work done . For Melanie Cummings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrolling her three-year-old daughter in an afternoon nursery school to make time for phone interviews . Wendy Barker of Calgary works while her two girls are in school now . But when they were babies and she was starting out as a freelance business analyst , she traded child care with another mom who also worked from home . " It was the perfect solution , " she says . " We both had a chance to get our work done and our kids were with another mom that we knew and trusted . " That said , Wendy recalls the mad scramble when one of her children was sick and she had a deadline to meet . After taking care of her kids through the day , " I 'd end up working well into the wee hours of the morning . " Her husband , meanwhile , had a traditional job . " It always seemed to be my job that got put aside , and then I 'd have to make up for it whenever I could fit it in . " SURVIVAL OF THE START-UP Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 Stats Canada report , about 23 percent of small businesses do n't survive their first year and half wo n't make it to their third year . How do you avoid that fate ? Establishing a viable plan in the early stages is crucial , contends Somani , as is getting training in the areas of business where you 're not an expert . And , he stresses , keep expenses down . " I think the reason some people " manage to survive tough economic times is that they manage their cash flow really well , and they 're able to think of really creative ways to attract new customers . " My own secret weapon ? My adorable  --  if somewhat unconventional  --  secretarial staff . We 're still ironing out the details , but if you call , only to find that I 'm " indisposed , " you 'll know where I am . Now if I could just get them to ask for last names , too .

One major benefit of operating a home-based business is the range of tax deductions you can claim . In general , as long as the expense is reasonable and has a business purpose , you can deduct it . There are exceptions , though : No matter how much business you swing on the golf course , those fees are n't deductible , nor are health club memberships . " We also get people who consistently submit receipts for dry cleaning or haircuts , " says Jasek . " They argue that they must look good to pick up business . Again the Income Tax act considers these personal items and therefore not deductible . " As a rule of thumb , anything that can be used for longer than a year ( think furniture , office equipment ) must be written off over a number of years as " capital costs . " While there 's no definitive list of write-offs , says Jasek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOME : a proportion of your rent or mortgage interest , realty taxes , insurance and utilities . Symbol Not Transcribed filled square THE FORMULA : If your home has eight rooms ( not including common areas like hallways , washrooms and stairs ) , and one is devoted to your home office , you could deduct one-eighth of the above expenses . Symbol Not Transcribed filled square CAVEAT : You either have to be using the space regularly and continuously to meet clients , or it has to be your principal place of business . And do n't try writing off depreciation on your home ( capital costs ) unless you want to lose your principal residence deduction ( which allows you to sell your home without paying tax on the increase in its value ) .

Symbol Not Transcribed filled square CAVEAT : You ca n't deduct the cost of mileage to and from work . As well , you should keep a mileage log ( or at least a detailed list of meetings outside the home ) in case you need proof .

Symbol Not Transcribed filled square THE FORMULA : You can write off 20 to 30 percent the first year , 20 to 30 percent of the balance remaining the following year , and so on until you 've written off the total amount . Even if you already own the car , computer , etc. , before you start your business , you can write off a proportion of capital costs based on the current market value up to a certain amount .

But remember : You 're still expected to pay tax on such transactions . SHOWING THEM THE MONEY Many home biz owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notion of how to launch a business , says Toronto accountant Sam Seidman . Here are eight steps to get you started on the right track : STEP ONE : Unless you 're operating under your own name , you have to register your business as a sole proprietorship , a partnership or a corporation . The Business Startup Assistant at bsa.cbsc.org lets you register on-line . Fees vary depending on the province , but you 'll pay $80 for five years registration for a sole proprietorship in Ontario . Incorporating is more expensive  --  hundreds of dollars . Talk to an accountant to see if it 's worth your while . If you 're selling a product , you 'll need a vendor permit , plus you 'll have to collect and regularly submit sales tax . STEP TWO : While you do n't have to collect GST until you have sales in excess of $30,000 , Seidman recommends registering for it from the outset . Why ? The businesses you collect it from can claim back any GST they pay you , and you can deduct the GST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't collect it , you 're letting your clients know you 're a small operation , which may not engender confidence . STEP THREE : Open a separate business bank account so you 're not mixing business and personal finances . While this is n't strictly required by Canada Customs and Revenue Agency ( CCRA ) , it makes it much easier to track business earnings and expenditures . STEP FOUR : Set up a basic accounting system , using either a software package for small businesses ( like Quicken or Quickbooks ) or a paper-based system . At the very least , you need to be able to track receivables ( money owing to the business ) , payables ( what you owe to others ) and expenses ( what you 've spent on the business ) . STEP FIVE : Begin to report income from self-employment on a calenda : year basis . So if you started your business in April 2003 , your reporting period for that tax year would run from April to December 31 , 2003 . Record income at the time you bill your clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Get to know CCRA 's regulations on deductions . Some basics : Symbol Not Transcribed filled square You can only deduct an expense if there is " a reasonable expectation of profits "  --  CCRA wo n't agree to deductions for a business that is really just a hobby . Symbol Not Transcribed filled square Your deductions can be higher than your income from the business in any given year , meaning you can use them to create a loss for income tax purposes . If you have no income to offset , the losses can be carried forward up to seven years , or back three years to recover taxes you 've already paid . STEP SEVEN : Begin setting aside sales tax , GST and income tax as soon as clients start paying you , or risk a nasty tax bill . Income tax can be paid once a year until your payments top $2,000 ( except in Quebec , where it 's $1,200 ) . Then you have to start paying quarterly .

STEP EIGHT : If you can , seek the help of an accountant or bookkeeper . The good news : Those fees are tax deductible . <p>
