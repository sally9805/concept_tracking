<p> It happens almost every day like clockwork . The scenario is different each time , but Metra engineer Ken Burdick knows he 'll see at least one person crossing the railroad tracks where they should n't be , with only a few hundred feet separating them from a potentially fatal collision with the train he is operating . <p> One day , it may be a group of children playing chicken with a train , seemingly unaware of another coming toward them from the opposite direction . Or it may be a woman and her children taking a shortcut to the convenience store on the other side of the tracks . At rush hour , more than a few commuters dash across the tracks at the last minute to avoid missing their train . <p> " People do n't realize you ca n't stop on a dime with nine cents left over , " Burdick said . " By the time you see someone , it 's almost too late . " <p> At least three times in his 38-year career , Burdick was too late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's not something you ever forget , " he said . Burdick wo n't talk about the deaths he witnessed as a freight train engineer before coming to Metra in 1990 . <p> Rail crossing fatalities have been steadily declining in Illinois for decades , but trespassing deaths continue to outpace the number of pedestrians and motorists killed at public grade crossings . <p> Last year , Illinois led the country in fatalities at public grade crossings , followed by California and Texas . <p> Statewide , 18 people in vehicles and 12 people on foot were killed at crossings , a slight increase over 2004 . Metra commuter trains were involved in eight fatal accidents , while Amtrak had two and freight railroads made up the remainder , according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration . <p> 24 killed trespassing on railroad <p> Those figures do n't include the 24 people who were killed last year while trespassing on railroad property , the Illinois Commerce Commission said . Illinois had the country 's fourth highest number of trespassing deaths in 2005 . <p> Rail safety experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other state besides Texas , making exposure to train traffic more common . Chicago in particular is the busiest rail gateway in the United States , accounting for one-third of the nation 's freight rail traffic . About 1,200 trains pass through the region each day . <p> By law , the only railroad property people in Illinois are authorized to use are commuter rail stations and public crossings , where roadways intersect the train tracks . <p> But even with fences and other barriers to keep them out , pedestrians often ignore the law to take shortcuts across the tracks . <p> Unclear how many are suicides <p> The decision to trespass proved fatal for 25 people in 2004 and 26 people in 2003 . <p> Nationwide , the number of trespasser deaths hovers around 500 each year , while the overall numbers of grade crossing collisions and deaths have been falling for decades . <p> Researchers say trespassing is a difficult problem to fight because there has n't been much analysis on who gets killed or injured . It is n't clear how many trespasser deaths are actually suicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation at Northwestern University who released a study this year on trespassing incidents . <p> About a third of the people struck by trains were sitting or lying down on or near the tracks , according to federal railroad data . <p> " You would think that would sound like intentional suicide , " Savage said . But a high proportion of trespassers who were killed had blood alcohol levels above the legal limit , Savage said , citing studies done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> As a result , " there may not be a purely engineering solution " to stopping trespasser deaths , which occur mostly among people in their 20s and 30s , Savage said . " It may not be a matter of putting up fences ; it may be more of a public health issue . " <p> The Illinois Commerce Commission bases its annual count of rail trespassing deaths and suicides on initial reports from police and coroners . <p> So far this year , there have been 13 apparent suicides statewide , compared with 18 in 2005 and 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths and suicides remains a challenge , fewer people in Illinois are dying or being injured by trains at grade crossings . <p> Today 's statistics on grade crossing accidents pale in comparison with 1976 , when 100 fatalities were reported in Illinois , data from the Federal Railroad Administration show . <p> The reduction in crossing collisions comes at a time when rail traffic is increasing across the country , the Association of American Railroads said . <p> Rail safety expert Chip Pew , who is the state coordinator for Operation Lifesaver , said outreach programs , coupled with federal and local initiatives to make railroad crossings safer are mostly responsible for driving the number of deaths and injuries down in recent years . <p> Most train-vehicle accidents are the result of motorist error , he said . In one out of every four such crashes , the vehicle drives into the train , instead of being struck by it , Illinois Commerce Commission data shows . <p> ' People are just not paying attention ' <p> " You 're screwing around with the radio , you 're talking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , " Pew said . " People are just not paying attention . " <p> Many pedestrians and motorists also misjudge the speed of an approaching train , giving them the false impression they can beat it . <p> During a recent ride with Ken Burdick and fellow Metra engineer Brian Voss , this reporter saw a boy in his late teens riding his bicycle around lowered crossing gates just before the Edgebrook station on the Milwaukee North line . He did n't slow down until Voss blew the train 's horn . " That 's the kind of thing you see every day , " Voss said . <p> " You never know if they 're going to stop or not , " Burdick said . <p> Freight train can take a mile to stop <p> What people do n't realize , Pew said , is that a freight train moving at 55 mph can take a mile or more to stop . Metra trains are typically lighter and have a shorter stopping distance , but express trains are sometimes coming into stations at 79 mph , Burdick said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pushing for railroad overpasses and underpasses that would keep trains separate from vehicles and pedestrians . But cost is a huge stumbling block . A single overpass can cost millions , depending on where it is located and how many lanes of traffic it would span . <p> Transportation agencies have invested in lower-cost improvements such as flashing lights , fences and better signs to alert people at railroad crossings . <p> Law enforcement also plays a role . Beginning next year , motorists driving around lowered gates or stopping on the tracks could be caught by cameras taking pictures of license plates . <p> They could get a $250 ticket or community service under a new law signed by Gov . Blagojevich last month . It aims to prevent accidents like one last November in Elmwood Park , where a Metra train slammed into several vehicles stuck on the tracks at Grand Avenue . <p> Fifteen cars were damaged , and 16 people were injured . <p> Every attempt to prevent accidents counts , but for families who have lost loved ones in rail collisions , every death is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson was riding her bike to work when she was struck and killed by a Union Pacific freight train at a crossing in southwest suburban Steger . <p> Anderson , a popular honor student who planned to become a lawyer , was to graduate from Bloom Trail High School the next day . <p> The May 23 accident occurred at Steger Road and 34th Street . The crossing gates came down to block cars from entering the tracks , but there were no gates for the part of the sidewalk Marielle was on , Steger Police Chief Richard Stultz said . <p> Witnesses said Marielle may have also been wearing headphones , though none were found at the scene . <p> Marielle was one of seven people to die so far this year at grade crossings , Pew said . <p> Her father , Craig Anderson , said no other family should have to suffer such a tragedy . <p> " My daughter should not be dead , " he said . " It 's not easy to lose someone who was supposed to graduate the next day and start her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo : John H.

Statewide , 30 people were killed at crossings last year .
