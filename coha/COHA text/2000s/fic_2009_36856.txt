Eliot R. Vanderthorpe , Jr. , has a curious revelation . <p> It hits him like a cartoon anvil during a self-consciously hip , sincerely debauched party  --  raging now into its second week  --  in the executive suite of Barcelona 's Hotel Internacional . Something does n't sit right with Eliot as he watches his friend William Pearson , the British prime minister 's son , take off his plaid boxer shorts and climb onto the king-sized bed . William is wearing a puffy white tuxedo shirt and is kneeling on the mattress , his lower body exposed , penis engorged . Two girls , a blonde and a brunette , lie on either side of him . They had until recently been wearing scanty party dresses . Now they 're zoned out . You might say passed out . <p> A man with a palmcam records William and the girls while another man wearing mediashades orchestrates their action . These two , the videographer and the director , work for the show That 's So Fucked Up , which streams every evening on the popular Sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the director 's hand indicates that the time has come for Eliot to strip off his tux and join in the fun . <p> At that moment some long-forgotten inner gear begins to move within Eliot . <p> " We 're exploiting these girls , " Eliot says . " We should n't have sex with them . " <p> William turns to Eliot . " Wha ? Have the drugs finally gotten to you , dude ? " <p> True , hallucinogens , amphetamines , entactogens , and a number of other substances whose pharmacological effects have yet to be fully mapped have all taken turns blasting Eliot 's brain over the last few weeks , so this strange feeling of ethical revulsion might be the by-product of an unforeseen drug interaction . And yet . <p> " No , man , I think I may have achieved a legitimate ethical realization . " <p> " Does that mean I 've got ta , like , fuck both these birds by myself ? " <p> " We 're on a tight schedule here , " the director says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours . So could you please take your ethical qualms outside ? Just , well , out there . " <p> The door to William 's bedroom is open . A private bodyguard stands watch , smoking and waiting for the orgy to begin . Music pulses in from the main dance floor . Eliot feels the beat . <p> " Well , no , " Eliot says . " I ca n't take my qualms outside . " He deepens his voice to make it resonate and feels oddly noble as he speaks . " And I 'm not going to participate in this . " <p> " What the hell has gotten into you , Eliot ? " William says . <p> " This is wrong . These girls do n't even speak English . " <p> " They spoke through their actions . Look , they 're on the bed . " <p> " They 're passed out on the bed . " <p> " We were making out before . And they signed release forms to appear on That 's So Fucked Up . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so totally beside the point . " <p> William 's erection slackens slightly at the labor of thought . " They want this . We 'll give their Reputations a huge boost on the market . " <p> QED . <p> With every philosophical angle now satisfyingly covered , William turns back to the blonde girl , begins kissing her unresponsive lips in an effort to reinvigorate his deflated penis . The videographer moves in closer to the action . <p> In his hyperconscious state , Eliot becomes aware that he is holding a champagne bottle . I 'm holding a giant bottle of Dom PTrignon , he thinks . The container of prestige cuvTe seems suddenly more like a bludgeon than a bottle . <p> Eliot jumps on the bed . His vintage ' 00s-era Converse All Star high-tops sink into the mattress , but Eliot manages to keep his balance . William does n't so much react to the bottle clocking him on the head as simply decide to give up on sex for the night and take a nap . The next blow breaks the videographer 's palmcam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively shouts " Cut ! " and runs away . <p> The bodyguard approaches cautiously , probably convinced that Eliot has had an amphetamine-fueled psychotic break . Perhaps he has . The bodyguard calls for backup on his communications rig , which sprouts from his left ear like tiny calla lilies . The girls , Eliot thinks . I have to save the girls . But he ca n't carry both of them , so he has to choose . Eliot picks the blonde who 'd been making out with him earlier , figuring that if she wakes up soon she might even consensually sleep with him . He thinks her name is Sonya . <p> Sonya is unexpectedly light . If not for his amphetamine high , Eliot imagines , he might not be able to simultaneously carry the blonde and fight the bodyguard . But he is and somehow he does . When the guard gets near the bed , Eliot kicks out his leg . The kick misses but the bodyguard takes a step back to dodge the blow , slips on a fragment of the videographer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fireman 's carry , Eliot flees the bedroom . <p> Eliot shoves his way through dancing drugged-out revelers . The electronic backbeat of party music quickens his pulse . The bodyguard follows from William 's bedroom and is joined by two others , all three dressed in matching black outfits featuring private security logos on red armbands . One fires his stun gun . Its projectile claw misses Eliot and instead sticks to a random dancer , a tall blond man . The blond man flies backward into other dancers , setting off a chain reaction of party panic . <p> Eliot lopes across the common area of the suite  --  littered with cracked champagne glasses , empty beer bottles , uneaten crab cakes , used and unused condoms , dried and drying bodily fluids , and a stratum of multicolored drug vials , among other things  --  toward the relative safety of his bedroom . He makes it to his room and kicks the door shut behind him . The door locks automatically . Within seconds , the bodyguards start pounding on it . <p> Sonya groans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thrown up on Eliot 's bed , maybe the same guy who 's masturbating on it now . The large print of Guernica , a gift from Sarah , has been ripped from the wall . " Give war a chance " is scrawled in black marker over one of the Cubist figures . Eliot 's fancy new holographic tablet computer has been cut in half with garden shears , which are jammed into the wall . Partiers have ransacked the room 's drawers and cabinets : clothes everywhere , empty bottles of wine , bookshelf tipped over , offprints of his philosophy books in shambles . Russell , Wittgenstein , Quine , Kripke , Davidson , Putnam . Someone has defiled his books with crayon-drawn picture stories that seem to involve lots of stick-figure men with hard penises and stick-figure women with their legs spread . Years of annotations , destroyed . The pounding on the door intensifies . Fuck . The door to his walk-in closet is open . Inside , two men are making out . <p> <br> Continues ...        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
