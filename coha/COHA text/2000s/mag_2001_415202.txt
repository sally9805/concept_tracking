PERCHED IN A CORNER OF IDAHO , TETON RIDGE RANCH SMOOTHS OUT THE ROUGH EDGES OF MOUNTAIN LIVING .

Opposite : Saddles await at the ranch , where no daily rides are scheduled ; instead , each guest arranges his ideal day-be it a raft trip or a ride and picnic-with one of the wranglers on hand . // THE AIR WAS THICK WITH HEAT AND the stir of insects swarming in the meadow grass.There had been no rain for days , and smoke from the fires burning near Teton National Park lay in thin , scattered bands on the western horizon . The boy settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the barrel , he could see a rusted tower and behind it a stand of aspens leaning in the breeze . He raised the gun to his cheek , and with his thumb released the safety lock . " Pull , " he said to the woman behind him . The first orange clay shot out and rose against the sky . He fired and instantly the bird shattered as the sound of the gunshot drowned out the meadow noise . Then he lowered the barrel until it was level again with the tower , said , " Pull , " and another clay flew out . He fired . The orange bird jerked to the left and fell in pieces to the ground . He opened the barrel of the shotgun , emptied the shells and looked at the woman mildly . " Do you have any more ? " he asked . Chris Tilt laughed softly . They had gone through four boxes of shells . Either my son , Jacob , then a week shy of his fifteenth birthday , was a crack shot or he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess he knows what he wants for Christmas , " said Chris in a low , dancing voice as we picked up the empty shell cases and tossed them into a pail . " You 'd better get yourself to Holland &; Holland . " She is a handsome woman , trim and dark-haired , the kind Ernest Hemingway wrote about , a man 's woman , who knows her way around guns and dogs and is n't afraid of discomfort ; though to judge from the elegant log house that she and her husband , a former New York ad man named Skip Tilt , built here in the southeast corner of Idaho , with a view of the Teton Valley , Chris is long past the roughing-it stage . She and her husband came out here in the late ' 70s , when land was $600 an acre ; today a person can pay as much as $10,000 . With several other couples , they founded Teton Ridge Ranch on 4,000 acres of sagebrush hills , grassy slopes and canyons , situated along a 6,800-foot rise that faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , drawn as much by the breathtaking landscape as by the ranch 's unique blend of first-class comfort and old-fashioned informality.With room for no more than ten guests at a time and no structured dude-ranch program , the atmosphere at Teton Ridge feels both exclusive and relaxed . It 's the sort of place where the lodge 's five guest suites have wood-burning stoves and Jacuzzis , but no keys ; where the dinner menus are prepared by a French-trained chef , but if you 're hungry at 2:00 A.M. , you can always slip down to the kitchen and fix yourself a snack . That kind of unmannered intimacy , without its seeming overly ingratiating or put on , is almost impossible to find nowadays , but as Skip Tilt says of the founders ' original aim , " We wanted people to feel they were in a private home . " In 1993 the group decided to sell Teton Ridge . " Everybody wanted to scatter to the winds , " Skip recalls . " We put the ranch on the market , thinking it would take three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . " The buyer turned out to be Paul Allen , the Microsoft pioneer . " We had no idea who Mr. Allen was , not the faintest , " says Skip with a bemused smile . The Tilts , who have a winter home near Green Pond , South Carolina , decided to stay close to the ranch , building their own place about a mile from the main lodge . Over the years , they 've gotten to know many of the return guests , and so , on occasion , they are reintegrated into the ranch 's social life , especially for bird-hunting season in the fall . Both are avid shooters . Because the current owner prefers to keep his involvement understated and rarely visits the ranch , little about Teton Ridge has changed . It 's still a place-and this is the hardest point to get across-where the expression " make yourself at home " is carried out with such natural &lan; that it takes a day or so to get used to the rhythm , and then you feel as if you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of wine after playing Annie Oakley to my son 's Kit Carson , " It 's hard to tell people what makes it work . " Although I had spent some time on a working ranch in Texas , I knew little about ranch life and certainly nothing , when we landed in Jackson , Wyoming , about this corner of the West . I needed to get my bearings . After being met by Jan Betts , one of the ranch 's knowledgeable managers , I asked if we could stop at a book shop . She knew just the place . Thirty minutes later , after crossing the Teton Pass , we arrived at the Dark Horse in Driggs , Idaho , where the proprietress thrust into my hands the book that would become my indispensable guide over the next six days : it is called Lady 's Choice . One may wonder what meaning the journey that Ethel Waxham , a Wellesley graduate , made by stage in 1905 into the remote Wind River Basin of Wyoming-or her ensuing courtship with a rancher who waited five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century later , when the only inconvenience is a mild case of saddle soreness . Photograph A remarkably rugged part of the West : the view from Cleaver Peak , which rises to 11,055 feet , faces Maidenform Peak . Photograph // Yet , in at least one way , Waxham 's journals opened my eyes to the purpose of gathering each evening around a table with a lodge full of strangers , swapping stories and forming impressions that , for a few days , would make us seem a loosely knit community . For if one thing has not changed in the West , it is the sense of isolation and the need , greater in Waxham 's day , when neighbors lived far apart , for ordinary human contact and news . I became so absorbed by the complexity and humor of Waxham 's accounts-the way she described a person 's dress or taciturn manner , or the report of a dance or the arrival of a far-flung visitor-that I could n't help viewing the people around me with a greater interest , especially since we did not retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing how much daily conversation in Waxham 's era revolved around her neighbors , I teased my fellow guests-among them , a prominent banker from NewYork and his wife ; a doctor from Washington , D.C. , and his wife ; and a television producer from Paris and his family-by casually informing them that they had given my son and me much to talk about during our morning trail rides . I eased their alarm by telling them about Waxham and how , in these vast open spaces , bits of news could sustain a sheep herder or roustabout for weeks .

There is n't even a swimming pool at Teton Ridge , a fact I minded at first in the dry August heat but soon forgot as we started to explore the ranch 's many well-marked trails , all at their peak of wildflower bloom , or took up rocking chairs on the lodge 's veranda to watch the light patterns on the 13,770-foot Grand Teton . Howard , the Washington doctor , was collapsed in the hammock on the lawn the afternoon we arrived ; we later learned that he had been out hiking . Lori Dooner , the dinner chef , was in the vegetable garden , gathering lettuce for the evening 's meal . We did not see the moose that ambled into the meadow beyond the lawn at dusk , but we heard about it from the wife of the French producer at cocktails . The lodge , then , is the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , gradual ascent up the driveway-past the barn and horse corrals and shooting fields-I was struck by how modest the lodge looked against the landscape of fir and aspen , a rustic lodgepole-pine dwelling with low extensions set upon an oval of emerald lawn.Yet inside , it is another story-huge , filled with eastern light and an immediate sense of comfort , with good western furnishings and paintings and four massive stone fireplaces . The scale of the great room , with its corners for reading or playing cards , and the guest suites perfectly jibes with the grandeur of the natural landscape . And after a delicious dinner of crab cakes and salad greens followed by beef tenderloin and a rather exotic , spunsugar-cage dessert , I could see why an ardent admirer , on his seventh visit to the ranch , had scribbled in the guest book , " You bet your we 're coming back ! " Another thing I like about the ranch is that there is n't a guilt-making staff member waiting to jump you at breakfast with a list of things you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're greeted by the unhurried Jan Betts and a couple of neatly dressed wranglers , who drop by the kitchen every morning to see who will be riding . Several guests planned to spend their day hiking up Table Mountain . Another was going fly-fishing . Someone else was playing golf at a nearby course , and the French couple and their son were bravely going on an all-day ride along the Wyoming border . Jacob and I , after a breakfast of oatmeal and freshly baked cinnamon rolls , opted for a morning ride with our wrangler , twenty-year-old Jamie Little , whose family has lived in the Teton Valley since the latter part of the 19th century Jamie proved to be great company as well as a skilled horsewoman , but she was surprised by my reaction when , two mornings later , we were descending into a mildly steep canyon and I suddenly whined with fear like a baby . Photograph // " You seemed so confident before , " she said , turning around in her saddle as our horses picked their way down the narrow trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but I have this thing about heights . " Actually , we were n't up very high at all , or on even a remotely difficult trail . But until you 've seen the terrain in this part of the West , you ca n't fully comprehend its ruggedness . " It is a cruel country as well as a beautiful one , " Waxham wrote in her journal on November 15 , 1905 , a month after arriving in Wyoming . " Men seem here only on sufferance . After every severe storm , we hear of people 's being lost . " During our stay , the Jackson paper ran an ecstatic report about how one of its local men , actor Harrison Ford , had volunteered to pilot his chopper up to Table Mountain to rescue a dehydrated hiker . Ford 's publicmindedness was indeed newsworthy , but to me the keyword was " dehydrated . " Even with all the modern communications gadgetry available , without sufficient water , a person can still get in trouble at these elevations . On horseback , the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at altitudes above 8,000 feet , can make even an experienced rider edgy . It 's not that the riding is dangerous ; the horses we rode were sound and surefooted , and anyway , you ca n't travel faster than a walk because of the roughness of the ground . But it 's a different kind of riding , and a person should n't have any illusions about galloping off into the sunset . ( I ought to admit that my qualms about the heights were personal . One morning , Jacob and I took a chairlift to the top of Grand Targhee , a ski resort , which is about forty minutes from the ranch , so we could hike around . Three minutes into the ride , I was rigid with fear and had to keep my eyes shut.Yet , once at the top , with my feet firmly on the ground , I had no problem standing at the edge and looking down . So everybody has a limit , and the staff at Teton Ridge was mindful of mine . ) The rest of the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventive cooking . " How do you guys feel about lamb tonight ? " she asked my son and me one morning as we were tucking into waffles . That sounded fine to us , although I think if I had said , " How about wolf ? " Lori , a former Marine corporal , would have at least considered it . By then , Jacob and I were lolling around the lodge like a couple of old hands.We did some hiking.We did a lot of shooting , mostly in the splendid company of the Tilts . One afternoon , we drove into Driggs and had milkshakes at a diner that advertised itself with a giant bison head over its door . In the late afternoon , we 'd sit on the veranda and listen to the birds in the trees , and I 'd marvel anew at the longsuffering patience of Ethel Waxham 's cowboy suitor , John Galloway Love . When I finally reached the place in the story where she consents to marry him and spend the rest of her life on a solitary ranch , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tetons . As part of our visit , we had signed on for a twoday pack trip with Kevin Little , Jamie 's father and the ranch 's head wrangler . An expert guide in back-country trails from southern Idaho to Yellowstone , Kevin understood my reservations about heights-and accepted with grace my decision , after the first day 's ride , which had us traversing a washed-out gully and immediately scrambling up its rocky spine , to spend the rest of the trip in camp with our boots up . It did us no harm to sit in a place where the mountains curved around us like a bowl and below us stretched a canyon whose beginning and end I was glad I had seen , but distantly . We unloaded the tents and cooking supplies from the packhorses , who had blunt , manly names-Hank and Max-that testified to their purpose , and set them loose along the stream in the meadow with hobbles and bells , which clinked out their movements in the waning light . This is what I remember most-the sound of the horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking and drinking Kevin 's black coffee until the moon was well above the rim of the bowl , and I wondered , thinking back to the fond dinner-hour talk at the ranch and even further , to a young woman and the ghost roads of Wyoming , " Was n't it always like this in the West-voices in the darkness ?
