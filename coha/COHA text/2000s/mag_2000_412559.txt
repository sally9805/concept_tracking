Loneliness can have you singing the dues in more ways than one . It has the potential to undermine your health by raising blood pressure and disrupting sleep , both of which put people at greater risk of heart trouble , according to a recent study . The research , conducted by a team from the University of Chicago and Ohio State University , found that loneliness can alter cardiac function and disrupt sleep . Lonely people perceive the world to be threatening and their orientation to others reduces positive feedback and emotional support . Consequently , the study learned that these perspectives can ultimately lead to higher blood pressure and sleep problems , which , in turn , have been shown to have an impact on the body 's resilience in dealing with disease . " Lonely people are likely to handle stress far worse than those who are n't lonely , " Dr. John Cacioppo , director of the study and the Tiffany and Margaret Blake Distinguished Service Professor in Psychology at the University of Chicago , explains to JET . " Lonely people tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as threatening . That appraisal style is associated with the cardio vascular response . " Studies in the - past-  have shown that lonely people do n't live as long and have more medical problems than non-lonely people , but the reasons were n't always clearly defined . The new research found that in response to stressors , lonely subjects showed increases in blood pressure fueled by increases in the resistance to blood flow through the body . Non  --  lonely subjects , on the other hand , also had an increase in blood pressure , but that change was due to more blood being pumped through their bodies in response to their feeling challenged by the stressors .

While both non  --  lonely and lonely subjects spent approximately equal amounts of time in bed , the lonely individuals slept 5.8 hours on average while non-lonely subjects slept 6.4 hours . A chronic lack of sleep , the study revealed , can cause a dangerous imbalance of critical hormones that hastens the aging process . " Lonely people have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less restored sleep . They take longer to get to sleep , and when they do fall asleep , they do n't sleep as soundly . They have microawakenings that will strike in the middle of the night where they will come out of a deep sleep . This will result in less restorative sleep , and you 'll wake up feeling tired . " In the study of 89 students ( 45 men and 44 women ) aged 18 through 24 at Ohio State University and 25 older people in Chicago , lonely older people were found to have blood pressure with 16 points higher than non  --  lonely participants . Cacioppo said that among older people , a lifetime of loneliness leads to diminished health as they experience continued high blood pressure and chronic sleep deprivation . " High blood pressure can put added stress on all organs leading to the development of other diseases , fl he contends . The findings about loneliness are significant because life-style changes have altered the structure of the family , the traditional source of emotional support . By 2010 , 31 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent increase from 1980 , according to the U.S. Census projections . A study last year found that the national marriage rate had dropped 43 percent over the past four decades to its lowest point ever . Photograph // That 's not to say , argues Cacioppo , that you ca n't experience loneliness in a union . " Marriages can be intense sources of loneliness . Being alone is about choice , and loneliness deals with one 's perception of a relationship . You can be in a crowd and feel lonely , " he observes . However , it is important to remember that just because a person wants to be alone does n't mean that he is ready to become a member of the loneliness club . Loneliness , reiterates Cacioppo , is not just about being alone . In fact , the two can be completely " uncorrelated , " he concedes . " Loneliness is a perceived state . Often because lonely people fear a negative evaluation , they avoid others , " he cites . While being alone can certainly " make you personally feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feelings : isolation ( such as the absence or distance from a romantic partner ) , disconnectedness ( not having close friends ) and belonging ( not identifying with or not being accepted by valued social groups ) . " The strength of social isolation as a risk factor is comparable to obesity , sedentary lifestyles and possibly even smoking , " says Cacioppo . Cacioppo noted that loneliness does n't discriminate or come in a certain fashion . " There were no big differences in gender , and it does n't respect any social category that we know yet ... The lonely subjects did n't have a different appearance , height , weight or education . These people were n't less attractive , less desirable or less wealthy . There was nothing different , " he states . However , as depressing as loneliness can be , there is good news . It can be overcome . Simply begin , suggests Cacioppo , by making contact with others . " Be strong-minded about getting out of it . Act like a non-lonely person would . Just call people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and help people . Be a volunteer and give to the community . If you help others , you wo n't feel as isolated . " He continues , " A good time to start to overcome loneliness that people overlook is when a person is in a new social situation , such as when they 've moved to a new community . Our research shows that people are n't lonely simply because of a personality trait , such as being shy . " By reaching out to make friends and helping others , people can increase their connections with others . " <p>
