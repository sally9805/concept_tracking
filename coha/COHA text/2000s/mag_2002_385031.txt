If you doubt that COLLEGE BASKETBALL is every bit the professional sport that the NBA is , meet the three biggest stars of Conference USA Headnote The Game // I FELL IN LOVE with it-college basketball , that is-at a drafty old barn in Lincoln Square in Worcester , Massachusetts , not far from where one of my great-uncles once owned a saloon . The Worcester Memorial Auditorium was square and huge , and it had towering murals depicting men loading shells into the big guns of a dreadnought and firing artillery along the banks of the Somme . You had to walk up broad staircases to see the murals in their entirety , and I did n't have the courage for that until I was nearly ten . I continued to love it-the whole raucous , tumbling parade of it  --  through my undergraduate days at Marquette University , where Al McGuire put together a delightfully rambunctious program . I even loved it when I covered it for five years , more or less full-time , for the Boston Herald . I have missed one Final Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I stopped loving college basketball : I stopped loving it in a hotel in Indianapolis in 1999 , on a Saturday afternoon , before the national semifinals . The lobby reeked of cigar smoke , stale beer , and cologne . Men wore silken sweat suits and cheap gold medallions , and they all had the sheen and glow of men who 'd Beat the Rap . Some rap , at least Somewhere . Everybody had a cell phone and was shouting into it I watched hands , hundreds of hands , all blooming with mon ey . Money passing , one set of hands to another , and tickets passing now , and five-dollar bottles of beer , and forty-dollar sweatshirts , and more tickets , and then more cash . Cash , like the whitecapped currents in a river , flowing down the length of the lobby , rising and falling and surging again . I ran out of the lobby , and , outside , I drank great gulps of the chilly , sodden air . I waved to a coach I knew , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the basketball . It was this whole college business that had lost me . This was not about lost innocence , I decided . It was about an intolerance , finally , for public bullshit . College basketball is a huge , complicated ( and , ultimately , doomed ) example of what historian Garry Wills calls a " structure of deceit . " It is a professional sport . There is nothing about the business of it that differs from the business of the NBA except for the rancid pretense that the people who do most of the work are morally obligated to do it for free . I assure you , everyone involved in it-the telecasters , the administrators , the coaches , and , most especially , the players-knows what a crock of beans this is . But in order to maintain the product , they 're all forced to entangle themselves in constant lies and petty fraudulence . In the face of overwhelming evidence , they even have to deny that it 's a product at all . Instead , we get morality fables for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gifted leaping children within them . Consider , just to take one highend example , Duke guard Jason Williams , who is the best player in college basketball by such a margin that it nearly beggars debate . Williams apparently will complete his degree in three years , which is a laudable accomplishment , considering he has a fifty-hour-per-week job that requires a great deal of business travel . However , in Sports Illustrated 's college-basketball preview , there was an anecdote in which Williams and several teammates are skylarking in a class called Physical Education 180 : Performance Enhancement . Photograph From top : Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins , Louisville 's Rick Pitino , and John Calipari of Memphis . // By all accounts , Williams is a decent young man , butthat is n't enough ofa parable . His record is treated as an academic triumph on a par with those of Erasmus of Holland and the Venerable Bede . But really , now , Phys Ed 180 ? In your penultimate semester ? The wonder is not that Williams got his degree in three years but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental corruption of college basketball , however , has nothing to do with Jason Williams or his degree . Rather , it is the widespread promulgation of the gross public lie that Jason Williams and his degree even matter . The sport goes blithely on whether or not Jason Williams ever sees the inside of a classroom-and it goes blithely on because the people who own the classrooms want it to . College basketball has long since outgrown the rules that everyone pretends to respect . Anyone who sees the corruption in college basketball as limited to violations of NCAA regulations and abuses of academic integrity is severely lacking in vision . They are merely the parenthetical clauses of a truthless annual narrative . The whole institution is a tin-pot fraud told by people who know they 're conning people who , in turn , know they 're being conned . Its real face is not the cheek  --  busting grins of cheerleaders in prairie field houses but that hotel lobby in Indianapolis , with the low-rent wiseguys with the gold medallions and the reek of commerce and the great river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , blooming fatty in every fist and looking for all the world like pom-poms . WHICH BRINGS US to Conference USA . Now , there are buccaneers and cutthroat types in every conference . And then there is Conference USA . Rick Pitino is here , coaching at Louisville after failing utterly with the Boston Celtics . And there is John Calipari at Memphis , whose tenure at Massachusetts is best marked by the fact that his team 's appearance in the 1996 Final Four has been expunged with Stalinist efficiency from the NCAA 's record book . And there is Bob Huggins at Cincinnati , grand old man ofthe league , with his zero  --  percent graduation rate and his gift for recruiting the likes of Ruben Patterson ( who , to be fair , did n't get nailed on the sex rap until afterhe left ) , Art Long , who punched out a police horse , and Dontonio Wingfield , who once trashed his mother 's kitchen when she would n't let him borrow the car . I watch these guys and I think of Al McGuire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true American original who coached with the touch of an Irish hedge poet , his teams a pure expression of who he was . His players yelled at him and he yelled back . His teams were independent in all the best senses of the word , including the Jeffersonian . He won it all in 1977 , in his last game as a coach , which was a poet 's touch . There 's a little of him in all these guys : Huggins has his glare , Pitino his New York sensibility and his uptown wardrobe , which Calipari also has , mostly as a secondhand knockoff of Pitino . But they do n't have it all , and they do n't have nearly enough of it . It is the difference between Runyon and Runyonesque . Of course , when Al was coaching , conferences were hoary old concoctions banded together for reasons of tradition and/or geographic convenience . The Atlantic Coast Conference is probably the most famous traditional college-basketball conference , although some schools in the Big 8-now the Big 12 , alas-have played each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Larry Bird and Magic Johnson transformed the quaint little NCAA men 's basketball tournament into the American equivalent of soccer 's World Cup , college basketball married television for the money . And since TV prizes nothing more than regularly scheduled programming , the windfall bestowed upon college basketball required the formation of conferences , if for no other purpose than to serve as administrative units . The first product of the new era was the Big East , assembled out of a clutch of formerly independent schools , most ofwhich happened to be located in major television markets up and down the Eastern Seaboard . As the television money grew  --  CBS 's astounding $6 billion rights fee for the tournament alone now more than pays the NCAA 's entire annual operating budget-conferences formed , reformed , and merged . The game was professionalizing itself , and doing it deliberately . Al saw it all coming , so he got out . He never was any good at running someone else 's con . Last winter , he died . Marquette now plays in Conference USA . CONFERENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan programs that either began as independents or that were unhappy with the power wielded by their previous conferences within the structure by which the NCAA parcels out its various franchises . It runs from Wisconsin in the north to Mississippi in the south , and from North Carolina in the east to Texas in the west . What is important to realize about Conference USA-other than the fact that its commissioner , Mike Slive , is a lawyer who once specialized in cutting deals on behalf of schools facing NCAA sanctions-is that the league makes no inherent sense at all . It has no geographic logic ( East Carolina and Houston ? ) , no demographic consistency ( DePaul and Memphis ? ) , no cultural affinities ( Cincinnati and Tulane ? ) , no historic rivalries ( St. Louis and South Florida ? ) , not even any common religious identity ( Marquette and Texas Christian University ? ) . It exists , solely and forever , as a means by which its various members can more easily fit their heads under the NCAA 's money spigot for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA teams that participated in the NCAA tournament brought home checks totaling $470,000 , which were shared with the other members of the conference . This year , it has million-dollar coaches with profiles higher than the pope 's . It has Pitino and his thoroughbred racehorses , and Calipari with his $15,000 annual clothing allowance . It has Freedom Hall in Louisville and the Pyramid in Memphis and the Bradley Center in Milwaukee . Conference USA is a professional vehicle of mass entertainment . Everybody knows this and nobody can admit it , so everybody involved in making a buck on the game is dedicated to the Kabuki morality by which high-level college basketball is played for free by students drawn from something close to the mainstream of an institution 's student body  --  which has as much to do with actual reality as I do in telling you that there is a unicorn in your garage . IF CONFERENCE USA is college basketball 's modern public identity , then John Calipari is its modern public face . A sleek little hustler from Pennsylvania , Calipari looks as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early draft . As an assistant at Pittsburgh , his tactics once occasioned a near brawl at the annual Big East meetings . At the University of Massachusetts , whence he hit the national stage , he ran a program that was quite literally a whorehouse ; his players mingled with so many sharpies , lowlifes , and dancers who did n't perform for Alvin Ailey that the Minutemen 's Final Four appearance has been completely written out of the history of the tournament . However , this was enough to get Calipari a $15 million deal with the New Jersey Nets , where , forced to coach honest professionals , he ultimately failed as miserably as Pitino did . In 2000 , he moved to the University of Memphis , a proud institution whose participation in the 1985 Final Four has been expunged as thoroughly as that of Calipari 's UMass club due to the spectacular misdeeds of its former coach , Dana Kirk , who was so garishly corrupt that the IRS packed him off to the federal sneezer for a spell . Clearly , in John Calipari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball zeitgeist , even though his record indicates that he should n't be allowed on a college campus without an armed escort . But John Calipari had been and is a star of the NCAA 's extended television series . Eliminating him would 've been like chloroforming Ralph Malph . On this cold night , Memphis has just beaten Temple in Philadelphia . It was a rocking evening on Broad Street ESPN  --  well , the Deuce-was in the house . There was an NBA-style pregame flourish , spotlights and all . The corporate signage  --  First Union ! Cingular ! - formed a gleaming halo around the arena 's lower rim . Cheerleaders cartwheeled in the shadows where nobody could see them . The game was taut and entertaining , and its unquestioned star was a Memphis freshman named Dajuan Wagner from nearby Camden , New Jersey . Wagner 's game is smooth and mature , and he got his 15 points easily , and from all over the floor . It was worth anyone 's money to see him play , which is the only thing left about college basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person who does the real work . Wagner had become something of a cause celebre because ofthe odd circumstances of his arrival at Memphis . He had met Calipari when the latter was an assistant with the ' ' 76ers . His decision to matriculate-God , this is so embarrassing  --  coincided with Calipari 's arrival there , his father 's being hired for a position with the Memphis basketball program , and the awarding of a basketball scholarship to Wagner 's best friend and high school teammate . Calipari is required to maintain that this is all just giddy serendipity . Of course , after the game , Calipari was selling hard the miracle of how he 'd come to coach this exemplary young man . " This is the kind of special kid we 're talking about , " says Calipari , who , at this point , might as well be pitching for Amway . " I 'd coach for thirty years if I could coach this kid . " Outside , Wagner was in the center of a joyous scrum full of friends from Camden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from up and down , and from every angle . " Just playing , man , " he answered to every question . " Just happy to be playing . " Above him , in the quiet , abandoned stands , you could see the ads all winking out .

It 's very difficult to get a black athlete here , because there are n't a lot of black people in Utah . You can go a week in Salt Lake and not see a black person .

You can get the big ride and the crib and the whole deal , but what happens is you lose out on a part of your life . And it 's hard to make up the friendships and the emotional maturation and the growth process , the sense of humor  --  all the fun . There 's only a certain amount of time in your life that you can go to frat parties and play an all-night card game in the dorm . Those are stolen moments . - DANIEL TORDAY Sidebar ( The Review ) I Remember Jim Valvano , by Mike Towle Sidebar Jim Valvano was justified , to an extent , by his horrible death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by his subsequent beatification by ESPN , where he worked at the end of his life . The Sidebar circumstances of his end tended to obscure the fact that as a basketball coach , he was the rough equivalent of the guy on the car lot who turns back odometers . His teams always played well-his 1983 NCAA champions were one of the few college teams on which the coach 's contributions were not overblown-but they always smelled just a bit , well , rank . Now Cumberland House Publishing gives us this volume of reminiscences from people who loved him . Everyone 's entitled to that , right ? -C . P. P. // <p>
