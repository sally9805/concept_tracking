The parade of taillights smoldered crimson through the patchy fog hovering over Old Highway 40 . Mickey Valdez tapped the brakes with the toe of her black dress pumps , trying to stay a respectable distance from the car in front of her . <p> The procession had left the church almost twenty minutes ago , but they were still barely two miles outside Clayburn 's city limits . Th e line of cars snaked up the hill  --  if you could call the road 's rolling incline that  --  and ahead of her , the red glow of brake lights dotted the highway , fl ickering off and on like so many fireflies . Cresting the rise , Mickey could barely make out the rows of pewter-colored gravestones poking through the mist beyond the wrought-iron gates of the Clayburn Cemetery . <p> She smoothed the skirt of her black crepe dress and tried to focus her thoughts on maneuvering the car , working not to let them stray to the funeral service she 'd come from . But when the first hearse turned onto the cemetery 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her sobs came like dry heaves , producing no tears , and for once she was glad to be in the car alone . <p> The line of cars came almost to a standstill as the second hearse crept through the gates . <p> The twin black Lincolns pulled to the side of the gravel lane , parking one behind the other near the plots where two fresh graves scarred the prairie . The drivers emerged from the hearses , walked in unison to the rear of their cars , and opened the curtained back doors . Mickey looked away . She could n't view those two caskets again . <p> When it came her turn to drive over the culvert under the high arch of the iron gates , she wanted desperately to keep on driving . To head west and never turn back . But Pete Truesdell stood in her way , directing traffic into the fenced-in graveyard . Mickey almost did n't recognize Pete . He sported a rumpled navy double-breasted suit instead of his usual coveralls . How he could see through the tears welling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart broke for the old man . She wondered if he was related to the family somehow . Seemed like everybody in Clayburn was related to at least one other family in town . Everybody but the Valdezes . <p> Pete waved the car in front of her through the gates and halted her with his other hand . <p> Maybe if she stayed in the car until the procession left the cemetery . She did n't want to walk across the uneven sod . Did n't want to risk the DeVore kids seeing her ... risk breaking down in front of them . What would she say ? What could anybody say to make what had happened be all right ? <p> She did n't know much about carbon monoxide poisoning , but she 'd heard that Kaye and Rachel had simply drifted off to sleep , never knowing they would wake up in heaven . She wondered if Doug DeVore found any solace in that knowledge . Maybe it was a small comfort that his wife and daughter had left this earth together . <p> But on Thanksgiving Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really gotten to know Kaye DeVore that well . They 'd exchanged pleasantries whenever Kaye dropped the kids off at the daycare on her way to her job at the high school , but usually Doug was the one who delivered the children and picked them up at night when he got off work at Trevor Ashlock 's print shop in town . <p> The DeVore kids were usually the last to get picked up , especially during harvest when Doug worked overtime to keep his farm going . But Mickey had never minded staying late . It was n't like she had a family of her own waiting for her at home . And she loved those kids . <p> Especially Rachel . Sweet , angel-faced Rachel , whose eyes always seemed to hold a wisdom beyond her years . Mickey had practically mourned when Rachel started kindergarten and was only at the daycare for an hour or two after school . Now she forced herself to look at the tiny white coffin the pallbearers lifted from the second hearse . She could not make it real that the sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doug climb from a black town car . One at a time , he helped his children out behind him . Carrying the baby in one arm , he tried to stretch his free arm around the other four kids , as if he could shelter them from what had happened . How he could even stand up under the weight of such tragedy was more than Mickey could imagine . And yet , for one shameful , irrational moment , she envied his grief , and would have traded places with him if it meant she 'd known a love worth grieving over , or been entrusted with a child of her own flesh and blood . She shook away the thoughts , disturbed by how long she 'd let herself entertain them . <p> She dreaded facing Doug the next time he brought the kids to the daycare center . Maybe they would n't come back . She 'd heard that Kaye 's mother had cancelled her plans to winter in Florida like she usually did . Harriet Thomas would remain in Kansas and help Doug out , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the kids and house , too , when she could take time away from running Wren 's Nest , the little bed-and-breakfast on Main Street . Wren was like a second grandma to the kids . Thank goodness for that . Six kids had to be  --  <p> Mickey shuddered and corrected herself . Only five now . That had to be a handful for anyone . The DeVores had gone on vacation in the middle of April last year , and with their kids out for a week , the workload was lighter , but the daycare center had been deathly quiet . <p> Deathly . Even though she was alone in the car , Mickey cringed at her choice of words . <p> She started at the tap on the hood of her car and looked up to see Pete motioning her through the gates . She put the car in gear and inched over the bumpy culvert . There was no turning back now . She followed the car in front of her and parked behind it next to the fence bordering the east side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her eye , and a startling thought nudged her . The last time she 'd been here for a funeral had also been the funeral of a mother and child . Trevor Ashlock 's wife , Amy , and their little boy . It would be five years come summer . <p> As if conjured by her thoughts , Trevor 's green pickup pulled in beside her . Mickey watched in her side mirror as he parked , then helped his young wife climb out of the passenger side . Meg walked with the gait of an obviously pregnant woman , and Trevor put a hand at the small of her back , guiding her over the uneven sod toward the funeral tent . <p> Mickey looked away . Seeing Trevor still brought a wave of sadness . Because of his profound loss , yes . But more selfishly , for her own loss . She 'd fallen hard for him after Amy 's death  --  and had entertained hopes that he might feel the same about her . That she might be able to ease his grief . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then Meg Anders had moved to town and almost before Mickey knew what happened , Trevor was married . He and Meg seemed very much in love , and Mickey did n't begrudge either of them an ounce of that happiness . But it did n't mean she was immune to a pang of envy whenever she saw them together . <p> This day had to be doubly difficult for Trevor . It must be a comfort to Doug having Trevor here  --  someone who 'd walked in his shoes and still somehow managed to get up the next morning  --  and the next and the next . <p> Again , she had to wonder what God was thinking . Where was He when these tragedies struck ? How could He stand by and let these terrible things happen to good men ... the best men she knew , next to her brothers ? None of it made sense . And the only One she knew to turn to for answers had stood by and let it all happen. 2009 by Deborah Raney <br> Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
