Six-year-olds are natural charmers , eager to please , brave , playful and about as grounded as soap bubbles . Now that Elian Gonzalez has made parents of us all , it was especially gruesome to watch his fate float by last week , in real time and on video , as the adults in his life prepared to tear him in two . <P> On the one hand , the more familiar he becomes to us with each passing slide down that swing set , the harder it is to imagine waving him onto the plane bound for Havana . On the other , there was a nasty sense last week that what his Miami relatives warned would happen to him in Cuba was already happening to him here . Was that really his idea to sit on a bed , wave his finger at his father and defy him  --  the father who must , surely , have played some role in making him the delightful kid everyone says he is ? " Papa , " he said , " I do not want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not going to Cuba . " By the time his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez had watched it for the fourth or fifth time in his lawyer 's office Thursday morning , he put his head down , his hands on the bridge of his nose , and cried . " Can we make them stop showing it ? " <P> Attorney General Janet Reno , who from the start has been running this show and last week moved to center stage , seemed to be torn as well , between her promise to enforce the law and her vow to do it gently , in a way that will not break this kid into pieces or set Miami on fire . There is the law , and then there is the law of the street . " They will have to take this child by force , " declared Great-Uncle Lazaro Gonzalez . Even as the Miami Cubans mocked Reno , called her a coward , practically dared her to come in and seize Elian , even as her Washington critics privately sneered that she was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chanting her promise of a fair and appropriate response and patiently stood by as the case ground up both wings of the family in legal maneuvering that kept Elian 's fate in limbo a few days longer . <P> The week began with at least a promise of an ending . Once Juan Miguel , after five long months , finally came to the U.S. to claim his son , Reno had assured him that the reunion would happen quickly and on the government 's terms . But her legal power to make that happen , by force if needed , was hostage to her fear of a scene too ugly to imagine , of armed marshals and enraged crowds and a desperate child in the middle . Would n't it be nice if all the family could just sit down and work this out ? <P> That would require a profound change of heart from Lazaro , a semi-employed mechanic with two drunk-driving convictions who had redeemed himself in the Cuban-exile community by his fight for custody of Elian . Now people called him a hero , a patriot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch his shirt . But Lazaro 's older brother Manuel , cast out as family patriarch for his belief that Elian should be with his father , had a sense that perhaps even Lazaro was wavering . Manuel lost a son to cancer nine years ago . " Hermano , " Manuel said in a phone call last week , " you and I were raised to believe in something very important  --  no one has the right to take a father 's child from him , except God . "
