Sigmund Ausfaller woke up shivering , prone on a cold floor . His head pounded . Tape bound his wrists and ankles to plasteel chains . <p> He had always known it would end horribly . Only the when , where , how , why , and by whom of it all had eluded him . <p> That fog was beginning to lift . <p> How had he gotten here , wherever here was ? As though from a great distance , Sigmund watched himself quest for recent memories . Why was it such a struggle ? <p> He remembered the pedestrian concourse of an open-air mall , shoppers streaming . They wore every color of the rainbow , clothing and hair and skin , in every conceivable combination and pattern . Overhead , fluffy clouds scudded across a clear blue sky . The sun was warm on his face . Work , for once , had been laid aside . He 'd been content . <p> Happiness is the sworn enemy of vigilance . How could he have been so careless ? <p> Sigmund forced open his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its walls , floor , and ceiling were resilient plastic . Light came from one wall . I could be anywhere , Sigmund thought-and then two details grabbed his attention . <p> The room was n't quite a box . The glowing wall had a bit of a curve to it . <p> There were recessed handholds in walls , floor , and ceiling . <p> Panic struck . He was on a spaceship ! Was gravity a hair higher than usual ? Lower ? He could n't tell . <p> Plasteel chains clattered dully as Sigmund sat up . He had watched enough old movies to expect chains to clink . Even as the room spun around him and everything faded to black , he found the energy to feel cheated . <p> COLD PLASTIC PRESSED AGAINST Sigmund 's cheek . He opened his eyes a crack to see the same spartan room . Cell . <p> This time he noticed that one link of his chains had been fused to a handhold in the deck . <p> Had he passed out from a panic attack ? Where was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the new episode receded . Fear could only muddy his thoughts . More deep breaths . <p> He had never before blacked out from panic . He could not believe that his blackout stemmed from panic . Yes , his faint had closely followed the thought he might be aboard a spaceship . It also had occurred just after he had sat up . Sigmund remembered his thoughts having been fuzzy . They seemed sharper now . <p> He 'd been drugged ! Doped up and barely awake , he 'd sat up too fast . That was why he had passed out . <p> More cautiously this time , Sigmund got into a sitting position . His head throbbed . He considered the pain dispassionately . Less disabling than the last time , he decided . Perhaps the drugs were wearing off . <p> Some odd corner of his mind felt shamed by his panic attacks . Most Earthborn had flatland phobia worse than he , and so what ? True , he 'd been born on Earth , but his parents had been all over Known Space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies , and wrong gravity . <p> On principle , Sigmund had been to the moon twice . He had had to know : Could he leave Earth should the need ever arise ? The second time , it was to make sure the success of that first trip was n't a fluke . <p> He listened carefully . The soft whir of a ventilation fan . Hints of conversation , unintelligible . His own heartbeat . None of the background powerplant hum that permeated the spaceships he 'd been on . Gravity felt as normal as his senses could judge . <p> Recognizing facts , spotting patterns , drawing inferences . . . he managed , but slowly , as though his thoughts swam through syrup . Traces of drugs remained in his system . He forced himself to concentrate . <p> If this was a ship , it was still on Earth . Someone meant to panic him , Sigmund decided . Someone wanted something from him . Until they got it , he 'd probably remain alive . <p> They . <p> For as long as Sigmund could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . <p> But even as Sigmund formed that thought , he knew " always " was n't quite correct . . . . <p> IN THE BEGINNING , they were unambiguous enough : the Kzinti . <p> The Third Man-Kzin War broke out in 2490 , the year Sigmund was born . He was five before he knew what a Kzin was-something like an upright orange cat , taller and much bulkier than a man , with a naked , rat-like tail . By then , the aliens had been defeated . The Kzinti Patriarchy ceded two colony worlds to the humans as reparations . In Sigmund 's lifetime , they had attacked human worlds three more times . They 'd lost those wars , too . <p> Fafnir was one of the worlds that changed hands after the third war . His parents had wanderlust and not a trace of flatland phobia . They left him in the care of an aunt , and went to Fafnir in 2500 for an adventure . <p> And found one . <p> Conflict erupted that year between humans on Fafnir and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in hostilities that failed to rise to the level of a numeral in the official reckoning of Man- Kzin Wars . It was a mere " border incident . " <p> Everyone knew the Kzinti ate their prey . <p> So they , for a long time , were Kzinti . Sigmund hated the ratcats , and everyone understood . And he hated his parents for abandoning him . The grief counselors told his aunt that that was normal . And he hated his aunt , as much as she reminded him of Mom-or perhaps because she did-for allowing Mom and Dad to leave him with her . <p> The same year his parents disappeared , the Puppeteers emerged from beyond the rim of Human Space . A species more unlike the Kzinti could not be imagined . Puppeteers looked like two-headed , three-legged , wingless ostriches . The heads on their sinuous necks reminded him of sock puppets . The brain , Aunt Susan told him , hid under the thick mop of mane between the massive shoulders . <p> So they came to include these other aliens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence . And then they came to include all aliens-because , really , how could anyone truly know otherwise ? <p> That was when Aunt Susan took him to a psychotherapist . Sigmund remembered the stunned look on her face after his first session . After she spoke alone with the therapist . Sigmund remembered her sobbing all that night in her bedroom . <p> He had a sickness , or sicknesses , he could n't spell , much less understand : a paranoid personality disorder . Monothematic delusion with delusional misidentication syndrome . He did n't know if he believed the supposed silver lining : that it was treatable . <p> What Sigmund did believe was the other consolation Dr. Swenson offered Aunt Susan-that paranoia is an affliction of the brightest . <p> In time , Sigmund understood . Trauma can cause stress can cause biochemical imbalances can cause mental illness . A day and a night asleep in an autodoc corrected the biochemical imbalance in his brain . But a single chemical tweak was n't enough : Knowing the world is out to get you is its own stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paranoid behaviors Sigmund had already learned . <p> Dr. Swenson was right : Sigmund was very smart . Smart enough to figure out what the therapist wanted to hear . Smart enough to learn what thoughts to keep to himself . <p> TREMBLING , SIGMUND TRIED AGAIN to shake off the drugs . Reliving old horrors served no useful purpose-especially now . He needed to focus . <p> Start with them . They were n't Kzinti : The room was too small . Kzinti would have gone crazy . <p> They wanted something from him ; how he responded might be the only control he had in this situation . Who might they be ? <p> Others might see in him only a middle-aged , midlevel financial analyst . A United Nations bureaucrat . A misanthrope dressed always in black , in a world where everyone else wore vibrant colors . <p> Sigmund saw more . All those years ago , Dr. Swenson had been far more correct than he knew . Sigmund was more than bright . He was brilliant- in the mind , where it counted , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody Sigmund was investigating . That narrowed it down . The bribe-taking customs officials at Quito Spaceport ? The sysadmin at the UN ID data center who moonlighted in identity laundering ? <p> Sigmund 's gut said otherwise . It was his other ongoing investigation : the Trojan Mafia . The gang , known by its reputed base in the Trojan Asteroids , engaged in every kind of smuggling , from artworks to weapons to experimental medicines . They killed for hire-and , more often , just to keep the authorities at bay . They were into extortion , money laundering . . . everything . Every other analyst in Investigations refused to touch them . <p> Surely that was who . <p> How was more speculative . A " chance " encounter in the pedestrian mall near his home , he guessed , by someone with a fast-acting hypo-sedative . He stumbles ; his assailant , to all appearances a Good Samaritan , helps him to the nearest transfer booth . <p> Where ? Other than somewhere on Earth , Sigmund was n't prepared to guess . On a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneously almost anywhere . <p> And when ? Blinking to de-blur his vision , Sigmund raised his hands . His left wrist hurt-not much , but it hurt . The time display had frozen . Ironic that , since the subcutaneous control pips felt melted : tiny beads beneath his thumb . Clock , weather , compass , calculator , maps , all the utility functions he normally summoned by . fingernail pressure . . . all gone . He guessed his implant had been fried with a magnetic pulse . It . t the program of disorientation . <p> They were n't as smart as they thought . The room had no sanitary facilities , not so much as a chamber pot , and so far he felt no need to pee . His black suit was clean , if rumpled . It was n't an ironclad case , but Sigmund guessed he had been snatched from that pedestrian mall no more than a few hours ago . <p> Footsteps ! They approached along the unseen corridor beyond the out-of- reach door . The door flew open . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway . A tall fringe of hair bobbed on an otherwise bald head : a Belter crest . And did not Hector , mightiest of the Trojans , famously wear a helmet with a plume of horsehair ? It all . t with the Trojan Mafia . <p> Sigmund blinked in the suddenly bright light , unable to make out details . <p> " Good , " the Belter said . " I see you 're awake . There 's someone who wants to speak with you . " <p> " YOU SEEM UNSURPRISED , Mr. Ausfaller . " <p> An eerie calm came over Sigmund . " Someone had to put through all the requests for reassignment . Someone had to tolerate one unproductive investigation after another . " <p> " Your boss , " his captor said . <p> " Someone had to authorize those transfers . Someone had to accept the department 's persistent failures . " Sigmund mustered all the irony he could . " Sir . " <p> " Meaning me . " Ben Grimaldi , Undersecretary-General for Inspections , leaned casually against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . <p> That was self-justifying nonsense , of course . Grimaldi would not have shown himself had there been any chance Sigmund would be let free . <p> Grimaldi broke a lengthening silence . " I need to learn what you know . More importantly , I need to know how . " <p> Once I reveal that , Sigmund thought , I 'm dead . He shifted position , his chains clicking dully . Change the subject . " Why the Trojans ? " <p> Grimaldi smiled humorlessly . " We prefer Achilles . The Trojans were losers . " <p> The Trojan Asteroids fell into two groups , those orbiting the L4 Lagrange point , 60 degrees ahead of Jupiter in its orbit , and those orbiting the L5 point , 60 degrees behind . The Greek Camp and the Trojan Camp , as they were sometimes called . Achilles was among the largest asteroids in the Greek Camp . Of course Hector also orbited there , so named before the labeling convention began . . . . <p> Sigmund pinched his leg , desperate to unmuddle his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he demanded . <p> " Enough . " Grimaldi looked pointedly at his wrist implant . " I must be going soon . Your stay here will be much more pleasant if you answer our questions voluntarily . " <p> More pleasant , perhaps . Also shorter ? Did buying time matter ? " Why the Trojans ? " <p> " Why would you think , Ausfaller ? They made a generous offer for my assistance . Official scrutiny is bad for their business . <p> " You 're an odd one , Sigmund , but I admit you 're capable . Persistent . I truly wish I thought we could buy you . Sadly , you inherited piles of money . You still chose to work for a pittance at the UN . " Grimaldi shook his head . " You live like a monk . You dress like a monk . Why offer you money when you ignore the wealth you already have ? It seems too likely you have principles . " <p> And there it was , the memory Sigmund had struggled for . Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps I can pay you . " <p> A reflexive flash of contempt-and then , more slowly , an expression of low cunning . Grimaldi said , " You 'd still have to tell everything you 've learned about me and my associates . And every detail about how you learned . It wo n't do for someone else to discover what you did . " <p> " Understood . " <p> " You would n't try to trick me , now would you ? " Grimaldi asked . <p> " Of course not , " Sigmund answered . <p> Grimaldi smacked his hands together ; strangely , that assurance had sufficed . " Stet . There will be no negotiation . One million stars , transferred into the numbered Belter account I will give you . Do n't bother to protest . I know you 're good for it . When your weekly reports began to show progress , I made it a point to learn about you . Here 's the deal , Mr. Ausfaller . You pay . You tell all . Then we let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Sigmund acted as though he believed . Anyway , the million-and-change he thought Grimaldi could trace was merely the fraction of Sigmund 's wealth he intended to be visible-and it was n't as though there were anyone to leave his money to . At worst , the charade might make his final hours less unpleasant . <p> Sigmund raised his arms , clanking on purpose . " For a million stars , I want these off . I want a nicer room . A suite with plumbing would be good . " <p> " We 'll see about that after the funds clear . Until then , maybe a pot . " Grimaldi took a sonic stunner and a handheld computer from pockets of his bodysuit . He whispered inaudibly into the handheld , set it on the deck , and then slid it with his shoe tip toward Sigmund . Handheld and foot never came within Sigmund 's reach . The sonic stunner was fixed on him . <p> " I 'm logged into an anonymous account . All other comm functions are locked out . Moments after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grimaldi laughed . " My colleagues , as I 'm sure you know , are skilled in anonymous transfers . " <p> My funds . Sigmund held in his anger . " Funds transfer from Bank of North America . " He paused for the voiceprint check . " Account : five . . . four . . . one . . . . " He articulated slowly and distinctly , leaving no chance for misinterpretation . Account number . Subaccount . Access codes . <p> The good news was the response time . He was still on Earth . <p> The stunner never wavered . He 'd be lucky to utter a suspicious syllable without being zapped . " Four . . . two . . . niner . . . . " <p> The bank AI spoke a challenge code . Grimaldi snorted in disgust . He wiggled the stunner , just a bit , in warning . <p> Sigmund shrugged . Clank . With the challenge-response feature set , a bank would accept transfer authorizations only in real time . Challenge response defeated coerced recordings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Sigmund could authorize the transfer with a duress code . That would alert his bank , but so what ? Money laundering was big business for the Trojans . Within minutes of the money 's release , it would be laundered through a dozen shell companies , off-world tax havens , and other anonymous venues . The duress code would accomplish nothing . <p> If he purposefully aborted the transfer , Grimaldi would know instantly- and the coming questioning could become a lot less pleasant . Or- <p> Dr. Swenson had been right : Sigmund was paranoid . And now , he thought , we 'll see if I 've been paranoid enough . <p> SIGMUND REMAINED IN CHAINS , but he 'd been offered a chair , an improvised chamber pot , and a greasy drinking bulb with tepid water . For a million stars , there should have been at least a leaded-glass tumbler and ice . <p> Grimaldi was long gone . He had delegated the detailed questioning to the lanky Belter Sigmund had met earlier . His interrogator disdained to offer a name . Sigmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy , hurled from the ramparts of Troy . Like Achilles ' son , Sigmund wanted no more kings of Troy . <p> Slow , pensive sips did n't buy much time . <p> All crimes lead to tax evasion . Sigmund had concentrated his quest for the Trojans there . He discoursed methodically on forensic techniques in spotting hidden income , waxing ever more pedantic . Whenever Astyanax began looking impatient , Sigmund offered a tidbit about which banking investigations had suggested what line of further investigation . A few such admissions evoked surprisingly astute questions . The Belter was something of an expert himself on income-tax evasion . <p> A handheld in Astyanax 's pocket squawked in alarm . There was sudden pandemonium in the corridor . Thudding footsteps . Thudding bodies ? The unmistakable zap of sonic stunners . <p> Astyanax dropped his own stunner , and took a utility knife from his belt . Low-tech but lethal . <p> " Do n't , " Sigmund said . " You 'll only make it wor- " <p> He gasped in shock at the sudden agony in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red . Lifeblood red . <p> " Nothing personal , " Astyanax said . <p> As Sigmund slumped , a squad of battle-armored ARMs burst through the door . To the frying-bacon sound of stunners , as everything went dark , Sigmund thought : Too late . . . . <p> Excerpted from Juggler of Worlds by Larry Niven And Edward M.
