How many shapes of pain are there ? Are any topologically equivalent ? And is one of them death ? <p> BIANTHA WOKE TO A HEAVY knocking on the door and found her face pressed against a book 's musty pages . She sat up and brushed her pale hair out of her face , trying to discern a pattern to the knocking and finding that the simplest one was impatience . Then she got to her feet and opened the door , since her warding spell had given her no warning of an unfriendly presence outside . Besides , it would be a little longer before the demons reached Evergard . <p> " Took your time answering the door , did n't you , Lady Biantha ? " Evergard 's gray-haired lord , Vathre , scowled at her . Without asking for permission , which he never did anyway , he strode past her to sweep his eyes over the flurry of papers that covered her desk . " You 'd think that , after years of glancing at your work , I might understand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She smiled at him , guessing that what frustrated him had little to do with her or the theorems that made her spells possible . Vathre visited her quarters when he needed an ear detached from court intrigues . " What troubles you this time , my lord ? " <p> He appropriated her one extra chair and gestured for her to sit at the desk , which she did , letting her smile fade . " We have n't much longer , Biantha . The demons have already , overrun Rix Pass . No one agrees on when they 'll get here . The astrologer refused to consult the stars , which is a first - claimed he did n't want to see even an iffy prediction- " Vathre looked away from her . " My best guess is that the demons will be here within a month . They still have to march , overwhelming army or no . " <p> Biantha nodded . Horses barely tolerated demon-scent and went mad if forced to carry demons . " And you came to me for battle spells ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one time she had killed with a spell had been for a child 's sake . It had not helped the child , as far as she knew . <p> " Do you have any battle spells ? " he asked gravely . <p> " Not many . " She leaned over and tapped the nearest pile of paper . " I was in the middle of this proof when I discovered that I 'd have to review one of Yverry 's theorems . I fell asleep trying to find it . Give me a few days and I can set up a battle spell that will kill any demons you 've already managed to wound . " Biantha saw the weariness in the lord 's green eyes and flushed . " It is n't much , I know . " <p> " That helps , but it is n't what I came for . " <p> Dread opened at the pit of her stomach . " The Prophecy . " Vathre inclined his head . <p> " I 've tried to pry some sense out of it ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed her eyes . " The poetry translates into shapes and equations that are simply intractable . I 've tried every kind of analysis and transformation I know .

" <p> " I do n't trust the minstrels . " His brows drew together . " And any time I consult the other magicians , I get too many uncertainties to untangle . The seers and healers are hopeless . The astrologer gets headaches trying to determine where to start . The cartomancer gives me a dozen different possibilities each time she casts the cards . As far as the Prophecy is concerned , yours is the only kind of magic I can trust . " <p> Biantha smiled wanly . " Which is why , of course , it 's so limited . " Sometimes she envied the astrologer , the cartomancer , the enchanters , the healers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versatile . " I 'll work on it , my lord . " <p> " A month , " he reminded her . <p> She hesitated . " Have you declared your heir yet ? " <p> Vathre eyed her . " Not you , too ? " <p> She swallowed . " If you die , my lord , someone must carry on . Do n't leave the succession in doubt . A problem may have several solutions , but some solutions can still be wrong . " <p> " We 've been over this before , " he said . " Considering the current state of affairs , I 'd have to declare a chain of succession down to the apprentice cook . If anyone survives , they can argue over it . My advisors can rule by council until then . " <p> Biantha bowed her head and watched him leave . <p> Usually Biantha avoided Evergard 's great hall . It reminded her of her former home , the demon emperor 's palace , though the scents of lavender and lilacs drifted through the air , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bowing or curtsying rigidly . Musicians played softly while nobles chattered , idle soldiers gambled for pittances and children scampered in and out , oblivious to the adults , strained voices . A few of the boys were fair-haired , like herself . Biantha closed her eyes briefly before turning along the walls , partly to avoid thinking about a particular fairhaired boy , partly because she had come to study the tapestries for inspiration . <p> The tapestries ' colors remained as vibrant as they had been when she first swore fealty to Lord Vathre upon the Blade Fidora . Biantha had long ago determined the logic by which the tapestries had been arranged , and did not concern herself with it now . Instead , she inspected the scenes of the Nightbreak War . <p> Here was the Battle of Noiren Field , where webs of starlight blinded a thousand soldiers and angular silhouettes soared above , ready for the massacre . Here was General Vian on a blood bay destrier , leading a charge against a phalanx of demons . Here was amber-eyed Lady Chandal weeping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been amber , flowers springing up where her tears splashed onto the battlefield . Biantha swallowed and quickened her steps . One by one she passed the tapestries until she found what she sought . <p> Unlike the other Nightbreak tapestries , its border had been woven in rust rather than Evergard 's colors , blue and black : rust for betrayal . She stared at the dispassionate face of Lord Mitre , enchanter and traitor to Evergard . His had been a simpler magic than her own , drawing upon ritual and incantation . With it he had almost defeated the Watchlanders ; only his daughter 's knife had saved them . <p> Symmetry , she sighed . The one thing she had pried from the Prophecy was that it possessed a twisted symmetry . It hinted at two wars between the demons ' empire and the Watchlands , and because records of the first war - the Nightbreak War - were scant , Biantha had yet to understand certain cantos , certain equations , that dealt with it . Hours with Evergard 's minstrels and historians had n't helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a second traitor among them . <p> Or that , because they had won the first war , they might lose the second , in a cruel mirroring transformation of history . <p> " Lady Biantha . " <p> She turned . " Yes ? " <p> The captain - she did not know his name - bowed slightly . " It is n't often that we see you down here , my lady . " <p> Biantha smiled wryly . " A bit too much noise for my work , and on occasion I test spells that might go wrong , sometimes fatally so . My chambers are shielded , but out here .... " <p> In the demon emperor 's court , her words would have been a veiled threat . Here , the captain nodded thoughtfully and gestured at the tapestry . " I was wondering why you were looking at this . Most people avoid it . " <p> " I was thinking about the Prophecy , " she said , retracing the intractable equations in her mind . There had to be away to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future , but it continued to escape her . " I 'm worried . " <p> " We all are . " <p> Biantha paused . " You said ' most people . ' Does that include yourself ? " His mouth twisted . " No . It 's a useful reminder . Do you ever wish you had stayed at the demon emperor 's palace ? " <p> She read honest curiosity in the captain 's expression , not innuendo . " Never . " She breathed deeply . " I started learning mathemagic there because magicians , even human magicians , are protected unless they do something foolish . Otherwise I would have been a slave or a soldier ; I had no wish for the former and no heart , no talent , for the latter . " <p> Such a small word , foolish , when the penalty it carried had given Biantha nightmares for years . She had seen the demon emperor touch his serpent-eyed scepter to a courtesan 's perfumed shoulder , as if in blessing ; had been unable to avert her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splinters of bone erupting through the rouged skin . <p> The captain looked down . " I 'm sorry to have reminded you , my lady . " <p> " A useful reminder , " she echoed . " And what does this portrait of Lord Mitre remind you of , if I may ask ? " <p> " Honor , and those who lose it , " he said . " Lord Mitre was my greatgrandfather . " <p> Biantha blinked and saw that there was , indeed , a resemblance in the structure of his face . Her eyes moved to the tapestry 's rust border . What had driven Mitre to betrayal ? It occurred to her , not for the first time , that she herself had fled the demon emperor 's court - but the symmetry here seemed incomplete . " Do you think there 's hope for us ? " she asked the captain . <p> He spread his hands , studying Biantha 's face as she had his just a moment before . " There are those who say we must have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She felt herself flush - and then laughed , though that laughter came perilously close to tears . " I have rarely known demons to forgive . Neither have they forgiven Evergard their defeat in the Nightbreak War . " <p> " More 's the pity , " said the captain , frowning thoughtfully , and took his leave . <p> For us or the demons ? Biantha thought . <p> Symmetry . The word haunted Biantha through the days and nights as she struggled with the Prophecy . She had wondered , after meeting the captain , if it meant something as simple as her flight from the demons , the fact that one of Lord Miere 's descendants survived here . The ballads said Miere had but a single daughter , named Paienne , but they made no mention of her after she saved the Watchlands . <p> The secret eluded her , slipped away from her , sent her into dreams where dizzying shifts in perspective finally drove her to awaken . Biantha turned to her tomes , seeking clues in others ' mathemagical speculations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells , bowing to the heartless logic of war . And went back to the tomes , their treasury of axioms and theorems , diagrams and discussions . <p> She was leafing through Athique 's Transformations when someone imitated thunder on her door . Biantha put down the book and opened the door . " Yes ? " <p> The herald bowed elaborately . " A meeting of the court , my lady . Lord Vathre wishes you to attend . " <p> " I 'll be there . " Firmly , she shut the door and changed into her formal robes as swiftly as she could . Biantha had attended few court meetings : at first , because Vathre had still been uncertain of her loyalties , then because of her awkwardness as a foreigner , and finally because she rarely had anything to contribute to matters of state and found her time better spent working on her magic . That Vathre should summon her now was unusual . <p> She was right . For once the attendants and servants had been cleared out , and the court had arrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his advisers sat at the head . She took her place between the astrologer and Lady lastre . The astrologer wore his habitual frown , while the lady 's face was cool and composed , revealing nothing . Biantha knew better , after playing draughts or rithmomachia against lastre once a week in less hectic times : Iastre 's face only went blank when she anticipated trouble . <p> " We have a guest today , " said Vathre at his driest . His eyes might have flicked to Biantha , too briefly for her to tell for certain . <p> On cue , the guards led in a man who wore black and red and gold , stripped of his sword - she knew there had been a sword , by the uniform . The style of his clothing spoke of the demons ' realm , and the only one besides the emperor who dared appear in those colors was his champion . The emperor 's champion , her son . <p> A challenge ? Biantha thought , clenching her hands so they would not shake . Has Marten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held different customs and would hardly surrender the Watchlands ' fate to a duel 's outcome . <p> Hopelessly , she studied the man who had so suddenly disrupted her memories of the child who hid flowers and leaves between the pages of her books , who climbed onto her desk to look out the window at the soldiers drilling . He had her pale hair , a face very like hers . His hands , relaxed at his sides , were also hers , though deadlier ; Biantha knew of the training an emperor 's champion underwent and had little faith that the guards could stop him from killing Vathre if he wished . But Marten 's eyes belonged to a man Biantha had tried to forget , who had died attempting to keep her from leaving the palace with their child . <p> Silence descended upon the throne room . Vathre 's court noted the resemblance , though Marten had yet to spot his mother . He looked straight ahead at Evergard 's lord . <p> Vathre stood and drew the Blade Fidora from its sheath . It glimmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tears . The lords and ladies glanced at each other but did not set whispers spinning through the room . Biantha , too , kept silent : a word spoken false in the unsheathed sword 's presence would cause it to weep or bleed ; the magic had driven men and women mad , and no lord of Evergard used it lightly . <p> " I am trying to decide whether you are very thoughtless or very clever , " Vathre said softly . " Who are you and why are you here ? " <p> " I was the sword at the emperor 's side , " he answered , " and that sword was nameless . " The pale-haired man closed his eyes , opened them . " My name is Marten . I came because the emperor has thousands of swords now , to do his bidding ; and I no longer found that bidding to my taste . " <p> Vathre glanced down at the Blade Fidora . Its color remained clear and true . " An interesting time to change your loyalties - if , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better way to leave than by showing up here in full uniform , scaring the guards out of their wits . " <p> " I left when the demons were ... subduing a village , " Marten said flatly . " I do n't know the village 's name . I hardly had time to find more suitable attire , my lord , and on campaign one dresses in uniform as a matter of course . To do otherwise would have aroused suspicion . " <p> " And you were n't afraid of being caught and killed on the spot ? " one of the advisers demanded . <p> He shrugged . " I was taught three spells in my training . One allowed me to walk unharmed through the palace wards . One calls fire from blood . And the last lets me pass by like the dream of a ghost . " <p> Biantha glanced at the Blade Fidora and its unwavering light . <p> Lady Iastre coughed . " Forgive me if I 'm less well-informed than I ought to be , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being ' on campaign . ' Is this a common thing , that the sword at the emperor 's side ' should be out in the field ? ' " <p> Marten 's eyes moved toward the source of the voice , and so he caught sight of Biantha . He inhaled sharply . Biantha felt her face freeze , though she longed to smile at the stranger her son had become . Answer , she wished him . Say you 've come to me after so many years  --  <p> Marten gathered himself and said , " I came to warn you , if nothing else ; death is a price I have taken from many . " His voice shook , but he continued to face Vathre squarely . " The demon emperor has come , and your battles will be the harder for it . " Then the whispers began , and even lastre cast troubled eyes toward Biantha ; the light of the Blade Fidora reflected all the shades of fear , all the colors of despair , that were voiced . " Please , " Marten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me help . My lord , I may be slow in learning that there is more to war than following orders . That there are people who die for their homes or their families - " <p> " Families , " Biantha repeated , tasting bitterness . So calm , his face , like polished metal . She felt Iastre 's hand on her arm and forced a smile . The whispers had died down , and Marten faltered . " I know how the <p> emperor thinks , " he said at last . " Let me help you there , my lord , or have me killed . Either way , you will have taken the emperor 's champion from him . " <p> So pale , his face , like Fidora 's light . Biantha caught her breath , waiting for Vathre to speak . <p> Lines of strain etched the lord 's face as he left the throne to stand before Marten . " Will you swear fealty to the Watchlands and their lord , then ? " <p> Marten did not flinch . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . She had not known , when she first came to Evergard , what powers the Blade Fidora possessed . A magician-smith had died in its forging , that there might never again be a traitor like Lord Mitre . Vathre had questioned Biantha , as he had just questioned Marten , and the first part of the sword 's virtue had been plain to her , a mirror of spoken minds . <p> Only later had Vathre told her the second part , that a false oath sworn upon the sword killed the oath-taker . Once an heir to Evergard had sworn guardianship to the Watchlands and their people and fallen dead . Once a weary soldier had woken Evergard 's lady three hours before dawn to confess a betrayal planned , and then committed suicide . Biantha had no desire to find her son the subject of another story , another song . How had Paienne felt , she wondered suddenly , when her father 's treachery became part of the Nightbreak War 's history ? <p> Marten laid his hand upon the glass-clear blade . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly at Biantha . <p> She could not bring herself to trust him , even after the long years , when he wore a uniform like his father 's . This time , she did turn away . <p> " There 's something sinful , " said lastre , fingers running round and round a captured draughts piece , " in sitting here playing a game when our world is falling apart . " <p> Biantha smiled uncertainly and considered her options . " If I stayed in my room and fretted about it all the time , I should go mad . " She nudged one of her pieces to a new square , musing on how the symmetry of the game - red on black , black on black - had soon been spoiled by their moves . <p> " I hear it was Marten 's planning that kept the demons from overrunning Silverbridge so far . " <p> She looked up and saw Iastre 's worried expression . " A good thing , I suppose - especially considering that the emperor now has a personal reason for wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think he should have stayed in the emperor 's service , " lastre protested . <p> Oh , but he did once , Biantha did not say . " It 's your move . " <p> A snort . " Do n't change the subject on me now . You fled the emperor 's palace , too , if you 'll recall . " <p> " Too well , " she agreed . She had slept poorly the first few years at Evergard , hearing danger in the footfalls that passed by her door and dreaming of the emperor 's serpent-eyed scepter upon her own shoulder . " But I left in a time of peace , and as terrible a crime as I had committed , I was only a human mathemagician . Besides " - and Biantha drew in a shaky breath - " they knew they had my son : punishment enough . " <p> Iastre shook her head and finally made her move . " He 's here now , and he may be our only hope . " <p> " That , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even here , playing draughts , Biantha found no escape from Marten . She had spotted him once in the courtyard , sparring against Evergard 's best soldiers while a healer and several enchanters looked on , lest the former champion seek a life instead of touch . At mealtimes in the great hall she took to eating at the far end of the high table ; yet over the clinking glasses and silverware , the tense voices and rustling clothes , Biantha heard Marten and Vathre speaking easily with each other . Evergard 's lord trusted Marten - they all trusted Marten now , while she dared not . <p> Like a pendulum , her thoughts swung between her son and Paienne , her son and Lord Miti-Ire . Late at night , when she walked the battlements listening vainly for the footfalls of marching soldiers , feeling betrayal 's cold hand in every tremor of the wind , she remembered tales of the Nightbreak War . Biantha had never put much faith in the minstrels ' embellished ballads , but the poetry preyed upon her fears . <p> Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in daily , she attempted to map past onto future , battle onto battle .. betrayal onto betrayal . And failed , over and over . And cursed the Prophecy , staring at the worn and inscrutable pages , alone in her room . It was during one of those bouts that a familiar knocking startled her from her work . <p> Marten ? thought Biantha involuntarily . But she had learned the rhythm of Vathres tread , and when she opened the door she knew who waited behind it . The twin edges of relief and disappointment cut her heart . <p> The gray-haired man looked her up and down , and scowled . " I thought you might be overworking yourself again . " <p> She essayed a smile , stepping aside so he could enter . " Overwork , my lord ? Tell that to the soldiers who train , and fight , and die for it , or see their friends die for it . Tell that to the cook or the servants in the keep . " <p> " There are ways and ways of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , casting a curious eye over her bookcase and her cluttered desk , then rested a hand on her shoulder . " Perhaps I should come back later , when you 've rested - and I do mean rest , not sitting in bed to read your books rather than sitting at your desk . " <p> Biantha craned her head back to glance at him , " At least tell me why you came . " <p> " Marten , " he said bluntly , releasing her shoulder . <p> She flinched . <p> " You 're hurting the boy , " Vathre said . " He 's been here quite a while and you have n't said a word to him . " <p> She arched an eyebrow . " He 's not the boy I left behind , my lord . " Her voice nearly broke . " I 'm old enough to call you a girl , Lady Biantha . Do n't quibble . Even I ca n't find cause to mistrust him , and the years have made me paranoid . " <p> " Oh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prophecy , worn smooth by years of on-and-off study . By all accounts , Marten 's advice was sound - but the demons kept coming . <p> " I 'm sending him to command at Silverbridge . " Vathre shook his head . " We 've held out as long as we can , but it looks like our efforts have been no more than a delaying action . I have n't told the council yet , but we 're going to have to withdraw to Aultgard . " He exhaled softly . " Marten will keep the demons occupied while the bulk of the army retreats . " Biantha stared at him . <p> " The soldiers are coming to trust him , you know , " he remarked . " He 's perhaps the best tactician Evergard has seen in the past couple generations , and I want to see if that trust is justified . " <p> She closed her eyes and said , " A gamble , my lord . Would n't you do better to put someone else in charge ? " <p> Vathre ignored her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce it . " <p> " Thank you , my lord . " Biantha paused , then added , " Do you know where Marten might be at the moment ? " <p> He smiled sadly . " Haunting the battlements , hoping you will stop by . " <p> She bowed her head and , after he had left , went to search for her son . Biantha found him by the southern tower , a sword sheathed at his back . Even now it disconcerted her to see him in the dress of Evergard 's soldiers , as if her mind refused to surrender that first image of Marten standing before the court in red and black and gold . <p> " Mother , " he said , clasping his hands behind his back . <p> Slowly , reluctantly , she faced him . " I 'm here . " <p> Moonlight pooled in his eyes and glittered in the tears that streaked his face . " I remember , " he said without accusation . " I was seven years old and you told me to pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marten had nearly reached the age where he would have to begin training as either a magician or a soldier , or forfeit what little protection his parents ' status gave him . Over the years , as their son grew older , she spoke to her husband of leaving the demons ' empire to seek refuge in the Watchlands or the realms further east . He always treated her kindly , without ever turning an eye to the courtesans - demon and human both - who served those the emperor favored . <p> Yet Biantha had never forgotten her husband 's puzzlement , molting slowly into anger , that she should wish to leave a court that sheltered them , though it did nothing to shelter others . She could not reconcile herself to the demons ' casual cruelty : One of the emperor 's nieces sent , after an ill-advised duel , to redeem her honor by riding a horse to the mines of Sarmont and back , five days and back forcing a terrified beast to carry her . The pale-eyed assassin who had fallen from favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had left evidence of his work . Children drowned after a plague blinded them and clouded their wits . If nothing else , the demons were as cruel to each other as to the humans who lived among and below them , but Biantha had found less and less comfort in that knowledge . <p> " I stood in the doorway , " Marten went on , " trying to understand . Then Father was weeping - " <p> She had said to her husband , If you will not come , then I must go without you . <p> " - and he drew his sword against you . " <p> " And I killed him , " Biantha said , dry-mouthed . " I tried to get you to come with me , but you would n't leave him . You started to cry . I had little time , and there were ever guards nearby , listening for anything amiss . So I went alone . It would have been my death to stay after murdering one of the emperor 's officers . In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or I. " <p> " Please do n't leave me again , " Marten whispered . He stood straight  --  backed in the darkness , the hilt of the sword at his back peering over his shoulder like a sleepy eye , but his face was taut . " I am leaving for Silverbridge tomorrow . " <p> " Will you be at the forefront ? " <p> " It would be unwise . " His mouth tightened for a moment . " I will be giving orders . " <p> " To kill . " And , perhaps , be killed , she wanted to say , but the words fluttered in her throat . <p> Marten met her gaze calmly . " It is war , Mother . " <p> " It is now , " she agreed , " but it was n't before . I know what it is to be the emperor 's champion . ' The sword at the emperor 's side/you said . The others heard the words only ; they have never lain awake and sleepless for memory of bloodstains on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries at night . How many fell to your blade , Marten ? " <p> " I came to follow you when I started losing count . " His eyes were dry , now , though Biantha saw the shapes of pain stirring behind them . " When the numbers started slipping out of my grasp . " <p> Biantha held silence before her like a skein of threads that wanted words to untangle it . <p> He lifted a hand , hesitated , let it drop . " I wanted to talk to you once , if never again . Before I go to Silverbridge where the demons await . " <p> She smiled at him , then . But always the suspicion remained that he had some way of breaking his oath to Vathre , that the demon emperor had sent him to ensure the Watchlands ' downfall through some subtle plan  --  or , more simply , that he had come to betray the mother he had abandoned , who had abandoned him ; she no longer knew which . <p> " Go , then , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left him to await dawn , alone . <p> Four days later , Biantha stood before her bookcase , eyes roaming aimlessly over her collection of mathemagical works , some in the tight , angular script of the demon empire , others in the ornate writing common to the Watchlands ' scholars . There has to be something useful , she told herself , even after having scoured everything that looked remotely relevant . Now , more than ever , she wished she had talent for another of the magical disciplines , which did not rely on memorized proofs or the vagaries of inspiration , though none of them had ever seemed to get far with the Prophecy . <p> Would that it were a straightforward problem  --  <p> Biantha froze . The Prophecy did not describe the idealized spaces with which she had grown accustomed to dealing , but the tangles of truth , the interactions of demons and humans , the snarls of cause and effect and relation . Even the astrologer admitted privately that his predictions , on occasion , failed spectacularly where people were involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong approach . <p> Evergard 's treasurer had once teased her about the cost of paper , though she took care to waste as little as possible . She located a pile of empty sheets in a drawer and set them on her desk , opening her copy of the Prophecy to the first page . After a moment , Biantha also retrieved Sarielle 's Speculations , Spells and Stranger Sets , sparing a glance for the 400-line poem in the back ; Sarielle of Rix had fancied herself a poet . She had passed evenings lingering over the book 's carefully engraved figures and diagrams , curves that Sarielle had labeled " pathological " for their peculiarities . <p> Symmetry . That which remained changeless . Red pieces upon black and black upon black at the start of a draughts match . A ballad that began and ended with the same sequence of measures ; and now that Biantha turned her thoughts in this direction , she remembered a song that traveling minstrels had performed before the court , voice after voice braiding into a whole that imitated each part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarielle 's pathological curves , where a segment of the proper proportion spawned yet more such segments . <p> Methodically , she went through the Prophecy , searching for these other symmetries , for the solution that had eluded her for so long . Late into the night , throat parched because she had drained her pitcher and dared not break her concentration by fetching another or calling a servant , Biantha placed Speculations , Spells and Stranger Sets to one side and thumbed through the appendix to Athique 's Infinities . Athique and Sarielle , contemporaries , had been opposites as far as titles went . She reached the approximations of various shapes , sieves and flowers , ferns and laces , that no mortal hand could craft . <p> One page in particular struck her : shapes built from varying polygons and with various " pathologies , " as Athique dubbed them in what Biantha suspected had been a jab at Sarielle 's would-be wordsmithing , repeating a procedure to the borders of infinity . The Prophecy harbored greater complexities , but she wondered if her solution might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded : a lifetime 's work that she had uncovered , explored briefly by mathemagicians before her , and she had little time in which to seek a solution that helped the Watchlands . <p> Even after she had snuffed the lamp and curled into bed , a headache devouring her brain , words still burned before her eyes : Symmetry . Pathologies . Infinity . <p> ONLY A FEW weeks later , Biantha found herself walking aimlessly down a corridor , freeing her mind from the Prophecy 's tyrannous grip , when Lady Iastre shook her shoulder . " They 're back , Biantha , " she said hurriedly . " I thought you 'd like to be there to greet them . " <p> " Who 's back ? " <p> " Your son . And those who survived Silverbridge.11 <p> Those who survived . Biantha closed her eyes , shaking . " If only the demons would leave us alone - " <p> The other woman nodded sadly . " But it 's not happening . The Emperor will soon be at Evergard itself , is the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't , " she said , and felt as though the keep were spinning around her while pitiless eyes peered through the walls . " Tell him - tell Marten - I 'm glad he 's back . " It was all she could think to say , a message for her son - a message that she would not deliver in person , because the urgency of the situation had jarred her thoughts back to the Prophecy . <p> " Biantha ! " lastre cried , too late to stop her . <p> In bits and pieces she learned the rest of the story , by eavesdropping benignly on dinner conversations and the servants ' gossip . The emperor had indeed forsaken his court for the battlefield , perhaps because of Evergard 's stubborn resistance . None of this surprised her , except when a curly-haired herald mentioned the serpent-eyed scepter . To her knowledge that scepter had never left the empire - unless , and the thought sickened her , the demons had begun to consider Evergard part of their empire . It had turned Silverbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarnish , and even now the demons advanced . <p> Vathre gave a few permission to flee further east with their families , those whose presence mattered little to the coming siege . Others prepared to fight , or die , or both ; the mock-battles that Biantha sometimes watched between the guards grew more grim , more intent . She and Iastre agreed that the time for draughts and rithmomachia had passed , as much as she would have welcomed the distraction . <p> As for Marten - she saw almost nothing of him except the terrible weariness that had taken up residence in his face , as though he had survived a torture past bearing . Biantha grieved for him as a mother ; as a mathemagician , she had no comfort to offer , for her own helplessness threatened to overwhelm her . Perhaps he in his turn sensed this , and left her alone . <p> Day by day the demons came closer , to the point where she could stand on the battlements and see the baleful lights in the distance : the orange of campfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day the discussions grew more frantic , more resigned . <p> At last , one morning , the horns blazed high and clear through the air , and the siege of Evergard began . Biantha took her place on the parapets without saying any farewells , though some had been said to her , and watched while archers fired into the demons ' massed ranks . Not long after , magefire rolled over their hastily raised shields , and she prepared her own spells . Only when the demons began to draw back and prepare a second attack did she call upon powers that required meticulous proofs , held in her mind like the memory of a favorite song - or a child in her arms . <p> She gathered all the shapes of pain that afflicted the demons and twisted them into death . Red mists obscured her vision as the spell wrenched her own soul , sparing her the need to watch the enemy falling . Yet she would have to use the spell again and again before the demons , mathemagicians shaped a ward against it . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason : it often took too long to create attacks or adapt to them . A theorem needed for a spell might take years to discover , or turn out to be impossible ; and inspiration , while swift , was sometimes unreliable . She had seen mathemagicians die from careless assumptions in spellcasting . <p> By midday Biantha no longer noticed the newly fallen corpses . She leaned against the wall 's cold stone- and glimpsed black and red and gold in the distance : the demon emperor , carrying the serpent-eyed scepter that she remembered too clearly . For a moment she thought of the Blade Fidora and cursed the Prophecy 's inscrutable symmetry . " No , " she whispered . Only if the emperor were certain of victory would he risk himself in the front lines , and a cold conviction froze her thoughts . <p> Marten . He 's counting on Marten to help him . <p> She had to find Vathre and warn him . She knew where he would be and ran , despite the archers ' protests that she endangered herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because she saw her fair-haired son beside gray-haired Vathre , directing the defense . " My lord ! The emperor Biantha nearly tripped , caught herself , continued running . <p> Vathre turned , trusting her , and then it happened . <p> The emperor raised his scepter , and darkness welled forth to batter Evergard 's walls . In the darkness , colors moved like the fire of dancing prisms ; silence reigned for a second , strangely disturbing after the clamor of war . Then the Emperor 's spell ended , leaving behind more dead than the eye could count at a glance . Broken shapes , blood , weapons twisted into deadly metal flowers , a wind like the breath of disease . <p> Biantha stared disbelievingly over the destruction and saw that the demons who had stood in the spell 's path had died as well ; saw that the emperor had come forward to spare his own soldiers , not - she hoped not - because he knew he had a traitor in the Watchlanders ' ranks . So much death , and all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magicians , was watch . <p> " Mercy , " Vathre breathed . <p> " The scepter , " Marten said harshly . " Its unspoken name is.Decay . " She looked across at the gates and sneezed , dust stinging her nostrils . Already those who had fallen were rotting , flesh blackening and curling to reveal bone ; Evergard 's sturdy walls had become cracked and mottled . <p> Marten was shouting orders for everyone to abandon that section of wall before it crumbled . Then he looked at her and said , " We have to get down . Before it spreads . You too , my lord . " <p> Vathre nodded curtly and offered Biantha his arm ; Marten led the way down , across footing made newly treacherous . The walls whispered dryly behind them , she flinched at the crash as a crenel broke off and plummeted . " - use that scepter again ? " she heard the lord asking Marten as she concentrated on her footing . <p> " No , " she and her son both said . Biantha continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without the blood sacrifices . Not against wood or stone . But a touch , against living flesh , is another matter . " <p> They had reached safety of sorts with the others who had fled the crumbling section of wall . " What of the Prophecy ? " Vathre asked her , grimacing as he cast his gaze over the morning 's carnage . <p> " Prophecy ? " Marten repeated , looking at them strangely . <p> Perhaps he had not heard , or failed to understand what he heard , in the brief time he had been at Evergard . Biantha doubted he had spent much time with the minstrels . At least he was not- she prayed not - a traitor , as she had thought at first . Breath coming hard , she looked around , listened to the cries of the wounded , and then , all at once , the answer came to her , one solution of several . <p> Perspective . Time and again she had brooded over the Prophecy and the second war it foretold . The rhymes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vathre not long ago . She had thought about the strange symmetry , the Nightbreak War 's traitor - but failed to consider that , in the Prophecy 's second war , the corresponding traitor might betray the demons . The demons , not the Watchlands . <p> Last time , Lord Miere had betrayed the Watchlands , and died at Paienne 's hand - father and daughter , while Biantha and Marten were mother and son . But the mirror was imperfect , as the twisted symmetry already showed her . Marten did not have to die , and there was still hope for victory . <p> " The emperor is still down there , " said Vathre quietly . " It seems that if someone were to stop him , we could hold the keep . Hold the keep , and have a chance of winning . " <p> " A challenge , " Biantha breathed , hardly aware that those around them were listening avidly , for on this hung Evergard 's fate . " Challenge the emperor . He has his honor , strange as it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turn down an opportunity to slay , or be slain by , that champion ? " <p> Had there been such a challenge in the Nightbreak War ? The ballads , the histories , failed to say . No matter . They were not living a ballad , but writing their own lines to the song . <p> Vathre nodded , seeing the sense in her words ; after all , she had lived in the demons ' realm . Then he unfastened the sheath of his sword from his belt and held it out to Marten . " Take the sword , " he said . <p> If she was wrong , giving the Blade Fidora to him was unrivaled folly . But they no longer had a choice , if they meant to take advantage of the Prophecy 's tangled possibilities . <p> He blanched . " I ca n't . I do n't even know who the heir is - " probably because Vathre still had not declared the succession . " I have n't the right . " Biantha gazed at the gates , now twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rallied the remaining troops and was grimly awaiting the demons ' advance . <p> The lord of Evergard said , exasperated , " I give you the right . This is n't the time for questions or self-recriminations . Take the sword . " <p> Resolutely , Marten accepted the Blade Fidora . He grasped the sword 's hilt , and it came clear of the scabbard , shining faintly . " I 'm sorry for what I have done in the past , " he whispered , " even though that does n't change what was done . Help me now . " <p> " Hurry , " said Biantha , guessing the battle 's shape . " The emperor will soon come to claim his prize , our home , and you must be there to stop him . " She stood on her toes and kissed him on the cheek : a mother 's kiss , which she had not given him for too many years . She called to mind every protective spell she could think of and forged them together around him despite her exhaustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to me . After losing him once , Biantha did not mean to lose him again . <p> " And go with mine , " Vathre echoed . <p> He ducked his head and moved away at a run . Shivering , Biantha tried to gather the strength for more magic against the demons , to influence the Prophecy in their favor . She felt as if she were a formula in an old book , a creature of faded ink and yellowed paper . <p> As she and Vathre watched , Marten shoved through the soldiers at the gate , pausing only to exchange a few words with some of his comrades . They parted for him , wondering that he and not Vathre held the Blade Fidora ; Vathre waved at them in reassurance . Past the gates were the emperor and his elites , dressed in rich colors , standing in near-perfect formation . <p> " Traitor , " said the emperor to Marten in the cool voice that never revealed anything but mockery ; demon and human both strained to hear him . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In answer Marten swung the sword toward the emperor 's exposed throat , where veins showed golden through the translucent skin . The elites reacted by moving to surround him while the emperor brought his serpent-eyed scepter up in a parry . The soldiers of Evergard , in their turn , advanced in Marten 's defense . Biantha felt a hysterical laugh forming : the soldiers of both sides looked as though they had choreographed their motions , like dancers . <p> Now , straining to see what was happening , she realized why the emperor had chosen her son for his champion . Several of the elites saw clearly the blows that would kill them , yet failed to counter in time . Yet her eyes were drawn to the emperor himself , and she sucked in her breath : the emperor appeared to be aiming at a woman who had crippled one of the elites , but Biantha saw the twist in the scepter 's trajectory that would bring it around to strike Marten . Even a traitor champion could not survive a single touch of the scepter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Marten ! " she screamed . He was all she had left of her old home and its decadent intrigues ; of a man with gentle hands who had loved her within the narrow limits of court life ; of her family . The emperor had stolen him from her for so long <p> Mathemagical intuition launched her past the meticulous lemmas and lines of a proof , panic giving her thoughts a hawk 's wings . Biantha spun one more spell . Symmetry : the emperor 's attack became Marten 's , in spaces too strange for the mind to imagine . The Blade Fidora went true to its target , while the scepter missed entirely , and it was the emperor 's golden blood that showered Marten 's hands . <p> I 'm sorry for everything , Marten , thought Biantha , and folded out of consciousness . <p> The minstrels who survived the Siege of Evergard made into song the deaths , the desperation , the duel between the demon emperor and he who was now heir to the Watchlands . Biantha , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had died .. for Mitre 's great-grandson . There was more to any story , she had learned , than what the minstrels remembered ; and this was as true of herself , her husband , her son . <p> Biantha wrote only two lines in the margin of an unfinished book  --  a book of her own theorems . <p> There are too many shapes of love to be counted . One of them is forgiveness . <p> It was a conjecture , not a proof , but Biantha knew its truth nonetheless . After the ink had dried , she left her room with its well-worn books and went to the great hall where Vathre and lastre , and most especially Marten , expected her for dinner . <p> - for Ch'mera , and for those who teach math <p> Author Affiliation
