Section : CARING FOR MOM &; DAD " Recently , my mom became tired and dizzy . Her doctor felt that two of her 11 meds were n't working well together . He made one switch , and within a week , she felt fine . How can I prevent future problems ? " <p> Medications are a double-edged sword for older people . Advances in pharmacology have enabled many people to live longer , healthier lives , but those same medications can be dangerous to the very people they benefit . Polypharmacy ( multiple drugs taken together ) is a major problem for the elderly because they are less able to tolerate side effects . <p> I like that your question gets at the practical issues of how to minimize these dangers . And there I can offer you some very concrete advice . Seven Steps to Safer Drug Use Always carry a complete record of your medications . This information should include each medication 's name , when you began taking it , the dosage , what doctor prescribed it , and the pharmacy that fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of times I 've tended to acutely sick patients on multiple drugs who could not tell me what they 're taking , or worse , patients for whom a stroke or other problem made them unable to share that information with me . Make sure the list is legible and up-to-date . Put allergies first . Do n't assume that because the doctor has prescribed a medication you think you 're not allergic to that it means he does n't need a list of your drug allergies . All drugs have " cousins , " and you may be allergic to other drugs in the same family . For example , many patients discover they 're allergic to sulfa drugs when they 're given an antibiotic , but sulfa is also found in certain diuretics , diabetes medicine , and blood pressure medicines . All things being equal , if I know a patient has reacted badly to sulfa , I 'll prescribe a different drug in the same category . Include herbal supplements , vitamins , etc . Do n't stop with what you 've gotten through prescriptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirin ) , and vitamins can all interact with prescription medications to cause problems . The list of side effects caused by prescribed drugs interacting with complementary therapies continues to grow . Share medication info with all your health care providers . Do this even if she is not prescribing medication . Medication may be relevant to symptoms you 're experiencing and to nondrug therapy being prescribed . For example , a patient of mine had severe bleeding from deep tissue massage prescribed by a physiatrist after the patient failed to reveal to the doctor that he was taking Coumadin ( a blood thinner ) . Read the package inserts that come with your medications . Be sure you understand them , and do n't be embarrassed to ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain anything that is n't clear . Patients who take control of their health conditions have better outcomes and get better care . I 'm not ashamed to admit that on more than one occasion , a patient brought to my attention a relevant prescribing problem that I had not considered or had forgotten about . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors ( who do multiple prescribing ) , you could be headed for a " too many cooks " problem , and a single pharmacy could be the only place with the overview of your drug needs and management . I urge everyone I know to adopt a local pharmacy and route all prescribing through them . Not only can their computer systems give you the heads up on potential drug interactions , but they 'll know when you 're running out of medicines and are more likely to help you in a pinch should you run out . Establish a relationship with your pharmacist . Come to view your pharmacist as a resource rather than simply a merchant . I 'm a big fan of primary care doctors , and I think there 's a case to be made for primary care pharmacists too . He may have more time than your doctor and will know everything that 's been prescribed for you . Why the Fuss about Drugs and Older People ? <p> Older adults have the highest number of adverse drug reactions of any group . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults have more chronic disease and are therefore more likely to be taking medicines , which creates the opportunity for more problems . ( It 's similar to why the auto insurance company is interested in how many miles you drive when setting your insurance premium : If you drive farther , you 're more likely to get in a fender bender . ) Also , older people are more likely to take multiple medicines than younger folks , creating the opportunity for drug interactions . <p> But there 's a medical explanation as well . Geriatricians are interested in drug-disease interactions . These are side effects that occur because the drug interacts not with another drug but with diseases mere likely to be present in an older person . Thus , medicine that may cause minor confusion in a 30-year-old will likely cause severe confusion in a patient with mild Alzheimer 's disease . Drugs that minimally impair balance in a teenager may cause an older person with Parkinson 's disease to start falling . <p> Finally , older people , even in the absence of kidney or liver disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ) , may eliminate drugs from their system more slowly than younger people , meaning that the same dose produces higher blood levels of the drug and potential toxicity . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Too much of a good thing can be deadly . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Your medical history affects your meds . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Mark S.
