Chapter One We scurried through the tunnels , Mr. Crepsley leading the way , Vancha and I in the middle with our prisoners , Harkat bringing up the rear . We said as little as possible , and I cuffed Steve into silence whenever he started to speak - I was n't in the mood to listen to his threats or insults . I did n't have a watch , but I 'd been ticking off the seconds inside my head . About ten minutes or so had passed by my reckoning . We 'd moved out of the modern tunnels and were back in the warren of old , damp tunnels . There was still a long way to go - plenty of time for the vampaneze to run us down . We came to a junction and Mr. Crepsley took the left turn . Vancha started to follow him , then stopped . " Larten , " he called him back . When Mr. Crepsley returned , Vancha crouched low . He was almost invisible in the darkness of the tunnels . " We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If we make straight for the surface , they 'll be upon us before we 're halfway there . " " But we could lose ourselves if we detour , " Mr. Crepsley said . " We do not know this area . We might run into a dead end . " " Aye , " Vancha sighed , " but it 's a chance we 'll have to take . I 'll act as a decoy and go back the way we came . The rest of you try andfind an alternative route out . I 'll work my way back to you later , if the luck of the vampires is with me . " Mr. Crepsley thought about that a moment , then nodded quickly . " Luck , Sire , " he said , but Vancha was already gone , disappearing into the gloom in an instant , moving with the almost perfect silence of the vampires . We rested a moment , than took the right tunnel and pressed on , Harkat now in charge of the vampet Vancha had kidnapped . We moved quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd passed this way . At the end of the tunnel , we branched off , again to the right . As we entered a fresh stretch of tunnel , Steve coughed loudly . Mr. Crepsley was on him in a flash . " Do that again and you die ! " he snapped , and I sensed the blade of his knife pressing against Steve 's throat . " It was a real cough - not a signal , " Steve snarled in reply . " It matters not ! " Mr. Crepsley hissed . " The next time , I will kill you . " Steve was silent after that , as was the vampet . We marched steadily upward , instinctively navigating the tunnels , wading through water and waste . I felt terrible , tired and drawn , but I did n't slow down . It must be daylight above ground , or very close to it . Our only hope was to get clear of the tunnels before the vampaneze found us - the sunlight should prevent them from pursuing us any further . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were coming up the tunnels at great speed , not having to worry about stealth . Mr. Crepsley dropped back a bit , to check if they were following us , but they did n't seem to have found our trail - all of them appeared to have gone after Vancha . We continued to climb , working our way closer to the surface . Our pursuers kept passing in and out of earshot . By the sounds they made , they 'd realized we were n't following the shortest route back , and had stopped and fanned out in search of us . I guessed that we were at least half an hour from ground level . If they located us anytime soon , we were certainly doomed . The tunnels were as tight as they were dark - a lone , well-placed vampet would have no difficulty mowing us down with a rifle or arrow-gun . We were picking our way over a heap of rubble in a crumbling tunnel when we were eventually spotted . A vampet with a torch entered the tunnel at the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , and roared triumphantly . " I 've found them ! They 're here ! They - " He got no further . A figure stepped out of the shadows behind him , grabbed his head and twisted sharply , left then right . The vampet dropped to the ground . His assailant paused just long enough to turn off the torch , then hurried over . I knew without having to see him that it was Vancha . " Good timing , " Harkat muttered as the scraggly Prince joined us . " I 've been shadowing you for a while , " Vancha said . " He 's not the first one I 've picked off . He just got a bit closer to you than the others . " " Any idea how far we are from the surface ? " I asked . " No , " Vancha said . " I was ahead of you earlier , but I 've been bringing up the rear for the last quarter of an hour , covering you and laying a few false trails . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are they close ? " " Aye , " came Vancha 's reply , and then he slipped away again , to provide more cover . Slightly further ahead , we found ourselves in familiar tunnels . We 'd explored a vast slice of the city 's infrastructure when hunting for the vampaneze , and had been in this section three or four times . We were no more than six or seven minutes from safety . Mr. Crepsley whistled loudly , signaling to Vancha . The Prince swiftly joined us and we pushed on vigorously , finding a new lease on life . " There they go ! " The shout came from a tunnel to our left . We did n't stop to check how many were nearby - putting our heads down , we pushed Steve and the vampet in front and ran . The vampaneze were n't long surging after us . Vancha dropped back and kept them at bay with his shurikens - sharp , multi-edged throwing stars that were lethal when thrown by one as experienced as Vancha March . By the hysterical voices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vampaneze and vampets had now converged behind us , but the tunnel we were in ran straight ahead , with hardly any side-tunnels opening out of it . Our enemies were n't able to sneak around and attack us from the side or in front - they were forced to follow behind . As we got closer to street level , the tunnels grew brighter , and my half-vampire eyes quickly adjusted to the dim light . I was now able to see the vampaneze and vampets trailing behind - and they were able to see us ! The vampaneze , like vampires , had sworn not to use any missile-firing weapons such as guns or bows , but the vampets were n't limited by that oath . They began firing as soon as they had a clear line of sight , and we had to run doubled-over . If we 'd had to cover a long distance in that uncomfortable crouch , they 'd have surely picked us off one by one , but within a minute of them opening fire , we arrived at a steel ladder leading up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unleashing a hail of shurikens at the vampets . Mr. Crepsley grabbed me and shoved me up the ladder . I did n't protest at being first . It made the most sense-if the vampaneze pressed forward , Mr. Crepsley was better equipped to fight them off . At the top of the ladder I braced myself , then heaved against the manhole cover with my shoulders . It flew off , clearing the way up . I hauled myself out and quickly checked my surroundings . I was in the middle of a small street ; it was early in the morning and nobody was about . Leaning back over the manhole , I yelled , " It 's clear ! " Seconds later , Steve Leopard crawled out of the manhole , grimacing in the sunlight ( almost blinding after being down the tunnels so long ) . Then Harkat came , followed by the vampet . There was a short delay after that . The tunnel underneath echoed with angry gun retorts . Fearing the worst , I was about to climb back down the ladder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out of the manhole , gasping wildly . Almost immediately , Vancha shot out after him . The pair must have jumped , one directly after the other . As soon as Vancha was clear of the manhole , I stumbled across the street , picked up the cover , shuffled back with it and set it in place . Then all four of us gathered around it , Vancha grasping several shurikens , Mr. Crepsley his knives , Harket his axe , and me my sword . We waited ten seconds . Twenty . Half a minute . A minute passed . Mr. Crepsley and Vancha were sweating stingingly beneath the wan glare of the morning sun . Nobody came . Vancha cocked an eyebrow at Mr. Crepsley . " Think they 've given up ? " " For a moment . " Mr. Crepsley nodded , backing off warily , switching his attention to Steve and the vampet , making sure they did n't make a break for freedom . " We should get out of ... this city , " Harkat said , wiping a layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Crepsley and Vancha , he was nicked in many places after his battle with the vampaneze , but the cuts were n't serious . " It would be suicide to remain . " " Run , rabbits , run , " Steve murmured , and I cuffed him around the ears again , shutting him up . " I 'm not leaving Debbie , " I said . " R.V. 's a crazed killer . I 'm not going to abandon her to him . " " What did you do to that maniac to madden him so much ? " Vancha asked , peeking down one of the small holes in the manhole cover , still not entirely convinced that we were in the clear . The purple animal hides he dressed in were hanging from his frame in shreds , and his dyed green hair was flecked with blood . " Nothing , " I sighed . " There was an accident at the Cirque Du Freak . He - " " We have no time for recollections , " Mr. Crepsley interrupted , tearing off the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as many places as Vancha 's hides . He squinted up at the sun . " In our state , we can not bear to stay in the sun very long . Whatever our choice , we must choose soon . " " Darren 's right , " Vancha said . " We ca n't leave . Not because of Debbie - much as I like her , I would n't sacrifice myself for her - but the Lord of the Vampaneze . We know he 's down there . We have to go after him . " " But he 's too well protected , " Harkat protested . " Those tunnels are full of vampaneze ... and vampets . We 'd perish for certain if we went ... down again . I say we flee and come back ... later , with help . " " You 've forgotten Mr. Tiny 's warning , " Vancha said . " We ca n't ask other vampires for help . I do n't care how poor the odds are - we must try to breach their defenses and kill their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But now is not the time . We are wounded and exhausted . We should rest and form a plan of action . The question is , where do we retire to - the apartments we have been using , or elsewhere ? " " Elsewhere , " Harkat said instantly . " The vampaneze know where ... we 've been living . If we stay , we 'd be crazy to go where ... they can attack anytime they like . " " I do n't know , " I muttered . " It was weird , the way they let us leave . I know Gannen said it was to spare the lives of his companions , but if they 'd killed us , they were guaranteed victory in the War of the Scars . I think there 's more to it than he was letting on . Having spared us when they had us trapped on their own turf , I doubt they 'll come all the way up here to fight on our territory . " My companions mused on that in silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to make sense of this , " I said . " Even if we ca n't , we can get some rest and tend to our wounds . Then , come night , we 'll attack . " " Sounds good to me , " Vancha said . " As good a plan as any , " Mr. Crepsley sighed . " Harkat ? " I asked the Little Person . His round green eyes were full of doubt , but he grimaced and nodded . " I think we 're fools to stay , but if ... we 're going to , I guess at least we have weapons and ... provisions there . " " Besides , " Vancha added grimly , " most of the apartments are empty . It 's quiet . " He ran a menacing finger along the neck of his captured vampet , a shavenheaded man with the dark " V " of the vampets tattooed above either ear . " There are some questions I want answered , but the asking wo n't be pleasant . It 'll be for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vampet sneered at Vancha as though unimpressed , but I could see fear in his blood-rimmed eyes . Vampaneze had the strength to withstand horrible torture , but vampets were human . A vampire could do terrible things to a human . Mr. Crepsley and Vancha wrapped their robes and hides around their heads and shoulders , to protect them from the worst of the sun . Then , pushing Steve and the vampet ahead of us , we climbed to roof level , got our bearings , and wearily headed for base . ( Continues ... )
