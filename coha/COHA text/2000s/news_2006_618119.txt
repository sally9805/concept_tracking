<p> Before he decided to open a high-end Japanese restaurant in a generic strip mall in southern Cobb County last year , chef Tomohiro Naito considered Midtown ( " too expensive to rent " ) and then an industrial area of Decatur ( too much competition from established Chinese eateries ) . <p> " I heard this location on Cobb Parkway was very favorable , " Naito says amid a recent noon-hour rush at Tomo , now touted as one of the best restaurants in metro Atlanta . The proximity to several mega-malls and affluent shoppers was an attraction , he said , and I-285 and I-75 are just around the corner . And there was also the new Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre , under construction nearby in this booming part of the county . <p> " I thought about all the good clientele coming before and after shows , " he says . " People who are educated and enjoy nice things know they have to pay for it . " <p> The Atlanta Opera is betting its future that Naito is right . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb . Beginning in fall 2007 , it will make the new arts center 's 2,750-seat Williams Theatre its home . <p> The move is historic : It marks the first time a major-city opera company will leave its established location within a city and move all its performances to a suburb , according to Opera America , a service organization based in New York . And though metro Atlanta 's reputation may be that of one large , sprawling landmass , for the opera , being in Cobb County could present an uncertain bundle of financial , sociological and political ramifications . <p> By moving from intown to the suburbs , is the opera , along with Naito 's Tomo restaurant , leading a wave of sophisticated pleasures ( exotic food , opera ) that were once the domain of cities ? Does it risk alienating its core audience and arts-hungry city dwellers who help make the city of Atlanta one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the country ? Does it send a warning signal about Atlanta 's lack of adequate venues ? <p> Time will tell , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on issues far more practical than philosophical . <p> For the past three seasons , the opera has performed at the city-owned Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center in Midtown . The 4,500-seat auditorium opened in 1968 and is often described as cavernous and charmless . It 's the company 's fourth home . <p> This past season , attendance  --  and , more importantly , fund-raising  --  slipped below what Atlanta Opera board President Greg Johnson calls " sustainable levels . " Although single-ticket purchases remain steady , subscriptions hit a low of 4,400 , or about half what they were at its previous home , the Fox Theatre , in 2002 . Subscriber surveys and a Georgia Tech study suggested that patrons balked at the civic center itself . <p> Atlanta Opera general director Dennis Hanthorn puts the opera 's situation in stark terms : " If we stay at the civic center , I do n't know if we can continue to survive . " Recently , the company announced drastic cutbacks . It will offer just three annual productions until its finances recover , down from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of Handel 's " Orlando , " planned for the 2006-07 season at the civic center ( and possibly give " Orlando " in Cobb in the 2008-09 season ) . And , to wipe out its $2.85 million debt , it will sell the Atlanta Opera Center , its office and rehearsal space on West Peachtree Street in Midtown . <p> Returning to the Fox , a popular movie palace that primarily hosts touring Broadway shows , is not feasible . The opera left there in the fall of 2004 for multiple reasons , primarily because theater management was unwilling to schedule its performance dates far enough in advance to allow the opera to hire singers and stage directors . ( Hanthorn 's recent remarks echo those of his predecessor , Alfred Kennedy , in 2002 : " If we stay at the Fox , we 'll die . It is not an option . " ) <p> For Hanthorn , the Cobb venue should be more hospitable for opera and the human voice . At his suggestion , for instance , the theater 's orchestra pit was designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its core repertoire . <p> " We 've looked at all the options , " says Hanthorn , " and there are n't any left . The city of Atlanta has n't stepped up to help . So we 're in a situation where we 've got a spectacular new theater in Cobb County , at an attractive rental price . We 'd be irresponsible if we did n't take it seriously . " <p> ' A distance phobia ' <p> But will enough of the opera 's audience gladly follow to its new home , in an area of unincorporated Cobb between Smyrna and Vinings known as " Sminings " ? And is leaving Midtown the right move at a time when Atlanta is experiencing a steady influx of new and returning residents to its central core ? A recent University of Virginia study indicated that the city of Atlanta 's affluence is growing faster than that of its suburbs : A decade ago the per capita income in the city was below the metropolitan average ; now it 's 28 percent higher , the fastest urban-wealth shift in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move will work , basing their optimism on demographics that show a slim majority of their audience and supporters live closer to the Cobb Energy Centre than to the civic center . Numbers supplied by Atlanta Opera marketing director Matt Basta show : <p> * 52 percent of current and lapsed subscribers and all single-ticket buyers from the past 24 months live closer to the Cobb center . <p> * 68 percent of all donors who have given $1,000 or more in the past two years live closer . <p> * Just over half the members of its board of directors are closer . <p> Basta says these figures , calculated by plugging subscriber and donor addresses into a mapping Web site , are not conclusive . But they also indicate that the intown numbers for the opera are sizable , as patrons from all the northern suburbs plus the well-heeled Buckhead and Vinings neighborhoods amount to just over half the opera 's audience . Across the 2005-06 season , the opera sold 29,000 tickets , down from a peak of 44,000 in 2003 . <p> Hanthorn says that for intown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a distance phobia to overcome . " But he admits it has n't examined any potential psychological obstacles . For instance , will the Williams Theatre and adjoining 10,000-square-foot ballroom seem classy enough for the champagne-sipping black-tie crowd ? ( The Fox scores big on this intangible ; the civic center does not . ) <p> Nevertheless , board President Johnson looks ahead to the day when the Cobb Energy Centre is seen as a steppingstone toward an expanded " arts corridor , " stretching northward from Midtown 's Fox and Woodruff Arts Center to Buckhead 's Chastain Park , then on to the Cobb center and , to the east , to a planned outdoor amphitheater owned by the ASO called Encore Park . <p> ' A landmark ' <p> Despite aggravating facts of suburban life such as sprawl and traffic , that vision appears to be supported by national census data , which show that five times as many people are moving into suburbs as into cities . Indeed , many social planners and academics see the return to city living by the affluent  --  a trend often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as merely a " niche lifestyle . " <p> " Many cities , like Atlanta , are banking on their reputations as culture and entertainment centers , but that 's probably a short-term mirage , " says Joel Kotkin , author of " The City : A Global History " and a fellow at the New America Foundation , a nonpartisan Washington think tank . <p> " I see it all over the country : Political and business leaders tout their city as a ' cool ' place to be and hope to lure the creative class , including bohemians , young professionals , childless couples and gays , " he says . " In many cases they 've succeeded in reviving portions of their once-desolate town centers , but it 's hardly with anything reminiscent of their past economic or social vitality . " <p> Thus , Kotkin calls the new Cobb Energy Centre , and the Atlanta Opera 's move there , a " landmark , the next level in the evolution of the suburbs . <p> " It may prove that Atlanta is evolving at a faster rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar room for unchecked sprawl , " he says . In the evolution of suburbs , " you ca n't re-engineer the disbursement , but slowly you can make life more livable . That 's where arts centers help . My own study of history is that the arts follow society , going where there are consumers and patrons . " <p> Once these kinds of centers open , he adds , " there 's a lot of community buy-in . It makes sense for suburban parents who are interested in the arts , and have kids who want to learn the arts  --  classical music and dance  --  that these places are what 's accessible . " <p> Hanthorn and the opera also see education as a key factor in winning patrons in Cobb . For synergy and cost savings , he has proposed sharing an education director with the Cobb center . The opera hopes to form a link with Cobb County  --  just as the opera currently hosts city of Atlanta students at the civic center . Details will be hammered out with Cobb center managing director Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Performing Arts .

" Soon we wo n't need a roomy house and a yard , " says Jones , a financial analyst for the Army . " Why should we live six miles from downtown when we want to walk to the restaurants we like , the High Museum and the opera ? " <p> Realtors call it the " live-work-play " lifestyle , and for many people in Atlanta , it 's centered on the Midtown scene , which offers a wealth of fashionable food , clubs and the arts . Atlanta Symphony Orchestra President Allison Vulgamore tries to sell the lifestyle , too , building enthusiasm for the orchestra 's planned Symphony Center , designed by architect Santiago Calatrava , as a beacon for the " play " component of that trinity . <p> Last month , when the opera 's pending move to Cobb was officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation : " I 'm torn between wanting the cultural amenities of living intown and not having to drive everywhere , and the fact that the opera really needs a better venue . " <p> Hal Smith and his partner live in Bartow County and attend the opera regularly . Disappointed with the quality of opera at the civic center , they canceled their season subscriptions two years ago , but had planned to join again if standards improved . But Smith says he 's " concerned " about the opera 's move . <p> " Cobb County does n't have the most admirable reputation of welcoming diversity , " he says , recalling political controversies that drew national attention , including anti-gay legislation that prompted the 1996 Summer Olympics to relocate several events and the recent debate over teaching evolution in the public schools . <p> " The gay community of Atlanta has given great support to all the arts  --  and especially the opera , " he says . The 2000 census shows metro Atlanta has the largest number of gays and lesbians of any community in the Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Sean Cahill , who studies demographics for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in New York . <p> Opera management , Smith suggests , " has a selling job in terms of getting intown Atlantans to drive farther  --  and it may just be my own paranoia , but also in letting everyone know they will be welcomed . Perhaps Cobb County needs to do some selling , too . " <p> Cobb County Commissioner Sam Olens , who 's led the effort to open the arts center , responds by saying , " I feel Cobb County is very welcoming of the arts . <p> " When the opera announced they were moving to Cobb , they received just a few negative e-mails , " Olens says . Referring to the political controversies , he adds , " One should listen to the business owners and civic leaders and everyday people  --  and not to a few isolated politicians .

Outreach is a top priority , and every bit of it will be inclusionary . " <p> Asked about some opera fans ' perception of the county , Hanthorn , a Cobb resident , responds , " I had n't thought about it , to be honest . " <p> Then he quickly adds : " I think of Atlanta , the whole metro area , as international and multicultural . I hope everyone feels welcome wherever we perform . We 're about opera for everyone , that 's the bottom line .
