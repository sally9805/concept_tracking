<p> The Hearst Corp . announced yesterday that it has agreed to sell its flagship newspaper , the afternoon San Francisco Examiner , to the owners of the San Francisco Independent . <p> Ted Fang , publisher of the thrice-weekly free newspaper , said he plans to print the Examiner six or seven times a week and reposition it as a morning paper that can compete head-on against The San Francisco Chronicle . <p> The transaction is expected to close at the end of the month , but Hearst will continue to operate the Examiner for Fang until late July . <p> Neither Fang nor Hearst officials disclosed the financial terms . A source close to the deal , however , characterized the purchase price as " nominal " but said Hearst is paying as much as $25 million a year in subsidies for up to three years as part of the deal . <p> Some observers , including San Francisco attorney William Coblentz , suspect that the Independent is being paid " a substantial sum " to pick up an afternoon paper with shrinking circulation to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst 's acquisition of The Chronicle . <p> ExIn LLC. , a new Fang-owned company , will acquire the Examiner 's name , subscriber list , Web site , news archives and newsroom assets , including a computer system , furniture and as many as 103 Examiner trucks and 3,900 news racks . ExIn LLC. did not acquire any of the Examiner 's real estate or printing presses and has the right , but no obligation , to try to hire members of the Examiner 's news staff . <p> The acquisition of the Examiner should help clear the way for Hearst 's acquisition of The Chronicle . The owners of the afternoon Examiner agreed to acquire the morning Chronicle for an estimated $660 million in August . But the deal has been delayed by a Justice Department antitrust review , objections from some city officials and a private lawsuit by former mayoral contender Clint Reilly , who said he wanted to preserve a competitive newspaper market in the city . <p> Since 1965 , The Chronicle and the Examiner have published under a joint operating agreement , sharing publishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial staffs . <p> The 2,000 employees of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency , which handles the joint operations , will become Hearst employees , although ExIn LLC. has the right to recruit agency staff members . <p> FOUR-MONTH MERGER PLAN <p> Examiner Publisher Tim White said the plan is for Hearst to close its deal with The Chronicle simultaneously with the sale of the Examiner at the end of March but to take four months to merge Examiner and Chronicle operations . <p> George Irish , head of Hearst 's newspaper division , said operating both the Examiner and the Chronicle with their current independent staffs until late July is designed to give Fang " time to determine how he 's going to employ people and run the business . " <p> Fang was optimistic about the new Examiner . <p> " The community sent a message that they wanted to keep the Examiner alive and that is what we intend to do , " said Fang . " San Francisco made history today by saving its second newspaper . The Examiner has had a long and colorful history for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Independent and Examiner will be published separately . <p> Unlike the free Independent , he said , the new Examiner will be " subscription-based . " <p> However , he could not provide immediate details on how many pages or sections it would contain , where it would be published or how large a staff the new Examiner would require . <p> White told an Examiner newsroom packed with reporters and editors from both newspapers yesterday that employees who are offered jobs by the new owner may accept or decline but nevertheless will be guaranteed a job with the merged Chronicle staff . <p> It is unclear how many Examiner staff members are likely to join Fang . During the session in the Examiner newsroom , one employee asked how many of her colleagues would take a job with the new owners . No hands went up . <p> Fang said that he did not intend to offer union contracts ( both newspapers are currently covered by union contracts ) but planned to aggressively recruit writers and editors locally and nationally . <p> There is no love lost between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Examiner . Chronicle and Examiner veteran and current Independent columnist Warren Hinckle has called his paper 's coverage of the Examiner " a holy crusade " against the media empire founded by William Randolph Hearst . The Independent also features a weekly comic called " Mr. Sharon Stone " in a not-so-subtle dig at Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein , who is married to actress Sharon Stone . <p> MAYOR EXPRESSES DELIGHT <p> San Francisco city officials were pleased the city will remain a two-daily newspaper town . But there was also a wait-and-see attitude toward how a Fang-owned newspaper will cover the news , given the Independent 's often controversial style in the past . <p> " I 'm delighted to hear that the Independent newspaper has come forward to purchase the San Francisco Examiner , " said Mayor Willie Brown in a statement from Paris , where he is attending a meeting of mayors from around the world . <p> " This will preserve the healthy newspaper environment that San Francisco has long enjoyed . We can now put the thought of a newspaper monopoly , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " added Brown , who has long enjoyed the all-out editorial support of the Fang family . <p> He has appointed members of the Fang family to various posts . Florence Fang , the family 's matriarch , is on the Film and Video Commission . James Fang , Ted Fang 's brother , is an elected BART board member who is close to the mayor . <p> Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano , who lost to Brown in the mayoral runoff last December , was one of three supervisors who had held hearings on the Hearst Corp . ' s plans for the Examiner . While expressing relief that the paper will stay in business , he also said the jury is still out on what kind of paper a Fang-owned Examiner would be . <p> " I was subjected to a lot of character assassination , especially by their columnist Warren Hinckle , instead of getting impartial political analysis . The question now is , How will the readers react to such treatment ? ' " he said . <p> " Objectivity and impartiality will be important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " he added . <p> A more optimistic view came from Supervisor Michael Yaki , who also held a hearing on the breakup of San Francisco 's joint operating agreement between the Examiner and Chronicle . <p> " I ca n't help but be proud that a Chinese American family is buying a great newspaper , " he said . <p> Yaki acknowledged that sometimes in the past the Independent 's coverage of local politics had been heavy-handed , but he said people should not judge the new Examiner by the past . <p> " Families that publish great newspapers often scratched and toiled and may have been sensationalistic . But once they get to the big leagues , they play in the big leagues , " he said . <p> LEGAL CHALLENGES REMAIN <p> Questions remained yesterday about potential legal challenges that still might halt the Hearst acquisition of The Chronicle and sale of the Examiner . <p> Since August , the U.S. Justice Department has been carefully scrutinizing Hearst 's bid for The Chronicle , a process that resulted in the long delay of the sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale that would close down a newspaper and reduce editorial competition . <p> In November , for example , the department filed papers in federal court intended at blocking , at least temporarily , a deal that would have closed one of two Honolulu newspapers . <p> White said yesterday Hearst would inform the Justice Department immediately of the new terms of the Examiner sale . There is a 10-day notice period , he said . <p> Assuming that the department does not file a legal challenge in court seeking to abort the deal , White said , the sales should close by the end of March . <p> University of California at Berkeley law professor Stephen Barnett , a national expert on newspaper antitrust law , said the Justice Department will be looking very closely to see if the Examiner sale is legitimate . <p> " On the whole , it looks like good news , " he said . " San Francisco will be able to keep newspaper competition . But there is a nagging doubt that this is a sweetheart deal to allow the Fangs to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis Globe Democrat was sold by Newhouse newspapers . " There were four qualified buyers , but the paper was reportedly sold to the bidder least likely to succeed , " he said . " The new owner ran it competitively for a few years then closed it . " <p> There were reportedly at least two other bids for the paper , including one by former mayoral candidate Reilly . <p> Calls to the Justice Department in Washington were not returned yesterday . <p> A second potential legal hitch in the San Francisco newspaper sales could come in an antitrust suit pending before U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker . <p> Reilly sued to block The Chronicle sale in January , contending that it would allow Hearst to monopolize the San Francisco newspaper market in violation of antitrust laws . <p> But Hearst officials said they believed that the terms of the Examiner sale outlined yesterday should end that litigation . The purpose of the suit was to preserve two competing newspapers , Irish said . <p> " This does that .
