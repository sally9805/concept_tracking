Sparrow By Sherri L. Smith Random House Sherri L. Smith 1 Somebody 's singing the blues . Somebody 's feeling like it 's the end of the world . Sorrow drowns out the running dish water in the kitchen and the honk of traffic downstairs . If I had the voice for it , I 'd sing right along . I try to follow the thread of music , but G'ma is calling loudly to me . Today must 've been a lonesome day , for her to pull those old records out again . No surprise , cooped up like she 's been these past months . And me , I 'm not exactly a breath of fresh air . I do n't have " young friends " to bring over and " put life " into the place , as G'ma would say . My seventeen 's not the ice cream social it was for G'ma in her day . Not since it 's just the two of us . " Kendall , are you listening to me ? " she hollers through the kitchen doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the lunch plates , bits of ham and sandwich spread rinsing down the drain . Of course I 'm listening . Everyone in the building 's listening to her too . G'ma 's not a quiet woman when she 's upset . " You 'd better be listening , ' cause your grandmother did n't raise a fool . " I dry my hands and go into the living room to get my coat . G'ma 's sitting there on the sofa , waving my report card at me . For a minute , she looks like her old self again , a strong , serious woman , with skin like sweet brown coffee , not dark andbruised-looking like mine . " Cream in my coffee , " she used to say to me . " ' Cause my mother wanted me to grow up sweet . " They forgot the sugar , I 'd want to say to her some days , but she would just shush me up for sassing . She 's got that shushing face on now . Her tough love face . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And today I 've let her down big-time . " Now , you go right back over to that high school and tell that teacher you want to do extra-credit work , however much it takes , to get your grades back up . My granddaughter is a good student and she 's going to graduate with the rest of her class . " G'ma swats the sofa arm with my report card , then places it gently down beside her . I sit across from the sofa on the edge of our old armchair , hands clasped and head down . " Yes , ma'am . " The blues song fades , and another one comes up . I remember the name of this one . It 's Sarah Vaughan singing " Misty . " Look at me , I 'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree . . . " It 's only midterms , " I say , like that helps . " I know my science , and English , too . I can get my D up to a B by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " G'ma takes out a handkerchief and wipes invisible crumbs from her mouth . " Do n't put all your eggs in that basket , " she warns me . " You were such a good student . Stay that way . I know it 's been difficult , but do n't let this " she waves her hand in the air --  " do n't let this stop you . " " This " means G'ma . We do n't talk about it much , but we both know the stroke she had last summer hurt her more than a little . The afghan over her lap reminds me that her legs are n't what they used to be . Winter does n't help either , especially not the icy winter Chicago gets . We keep up the exercises the doctor gave her , and they help . She 's walking with a cane now . But we live on the second floor of a brownstone walk-up , and the kitchen is a long twenty steps from the sofa . So I come home at lunch and straight after school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make dinner , breakfast , and lunch . If that means leaving English a little early , or getting to chemistry a little late , so be it . I owe G'ma more than a few skipped classes . Besides , I feel better when I 'm around . After a minute , G'ma lets me stand up . " Lunch was okay ? " I ask , grabbing my coat from the chair by the door . The smell of fried ham still hangs in the air . I boil it first , to get the salt out . G'ma likes her ham on white with mayonnaise , but she does n't seem to mind the low-fat spread I 've been using instead . The doctors say anything I can do to lower her cholesterol will reduce the likelihood of another stroke . " Very tasty , " G'ma says . " Just leave me a little water before you go . And cut off that phonograph player . " Phonograph player . I shake my head and cut off the turntable . For all her talk of the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She 'd fight me tooth and nail before she 'd ever let me play her a CD , and forget about a cell phone -- even if we could afford one on her pension . " Here you go . " I set down a fresh glass of water on the coffee table in front of her and kiss her papery cheek . " See you later . " " Be good . And tell that teacher what I said . " She pats me on the shoulder . I turn the TV on to her talk shows and head out into the Chicago wind .
