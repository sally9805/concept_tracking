Wildlife Works sells t-shirts , tank tops and jerseys , but its larger purpose is supporting the 80,000-acre Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary in Kenya , which it owns . Photograph // As protesters regularly disrupt meetings of the World Bank and the World Trade Organization , it 's becoming apparent that many consumers want their goods to come from companies that practice environmental and social responsibility . And those same consumers also object to international agreements like the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , which puts profit ahead of environmental protection . " When businesses can roam from country to country with few restrictions on their search for the lowest wages , the loosest environmental regulations and the most docile and desperate workers , then the destruction of livelihoods , cultures and environments can be enormous , " writes The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick in Business As Unusual . " You ca n't stop business from going global , but you can make it listen to the responsibilities that go with jumping on the globalization bandwagon . " Creating jobs with fair wages . Making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Protecting land and wildlife . A business that does any one of these things is a step ahead of the rest . But some companies are finding ways to do all three . Working for Wildlife In 1995 , Mike Korchinsky , CEO of Wildlife Works , sold his management consulting company and went to Kenya . " I had one of those clicked experiences where the meaning of life seemed right in front of me , " he says . But he also noticed the wildlife was in a fragile condition . A growing Kenyan human population competing for scarce resources made for slash-andburn agriculture and widespread poaching . " When you see the poverty first-hand , " says Korchinsky , " and see that these people are n't getting any benefit from the wildlife , you wonder why the wildlife has survived so long . " Korchinsky decided to make it in the community 's best interest to protect wildlife . He founded Wildlife Works , an eco-friendly clothing company , and then bought the 80,000-acre Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary to create a migration corridor within Tsavo National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the wildlife , " says Korchinsky . " We told the people , If you do n't honor the boundaries , the wildlife will go , and so will we . ' They were surprisingly receptive . " Though some t-shirts are being produced at the 20-acre eco-fac- tory at Rukinga , most of Wildlife Works ' clothing is made in San Francisco . Once the company has trained more workers , created a solid market demand and established African sources for their organic , hemp and eco-fleece clothing , production will be augmented in Kenya . Nevertheless , U.S. production and sales pay for the Rukinga sanctuary and the jobs for the people there . Sporty graphics and clever environmental slogans adorn Wildlife Works ' line of clothing , which includes t-shirts ( $31 ) and tank tops ( $24 ) for women , a safari jacket ( $175 ) , lightweight jackets ( $64 ) and men 's jersey tees ( $32 ) . The clothes can most easily be found in trendy fashion boutiques . Matte Matters When Alex Pryor came to California from Argentina for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country , with him .

Guayaki aims to make it more economically valuable to keep the standing trees on the land rather than chop them down for timber and cattle grazing . Guayaki has donated 2,700 acres to the 34 families who live on the reserve . The project also helps provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning , our mission was to sustain forests , " says Guayaki CEO Chris Mann . " Now , it 's to cultivate sustainability to preserve the culture of the people while promoting market-driven conservation . " Guayaki has been hosting " tea parties " from its 35-foot RV , decorated with a bright mural of the rainforest , and it is serving up matte lattes and smoothies in stores across America . Plans for a cafe are in the works , which would incorporate matte-based munchies and other rainforest-grown foods , such as brazil nuts , into the Guayaki mix .

Some of Maine 's Beeswax Between August 2000 and June 2001 , Maine-based Burt 's Bees , maker of natural body care products , spent $5 million on preserving the largest surviving area of the great North Woods , which once stretched from Maine to Minnesota . Some $2 million of that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John River in northwestern Maine-the biggest conservation acquisition in Maine 's history . Burt 's Bees , along with the group RESTORE : The North Woods , has proposed using the canal to create a new 3.2 million  --  acre Maine Woods National Park . " I believe the North Woods was a big set of lungs creating fresh air for this part of the ecosystem , says Burt 's sees cofounder Roxanne Quimby . " We have more need of that set of lungs than ever because we 're creating a lot of pollution south and west of here . It 's important to restore and preserve these trees , if for no other reason than to keep our air clean . " The land , bought back from logging ana paper companies , is still intact , with only about 100 people living in camps off-andon throughout the year . It plays host to moose , bear , Canada lynx and the second-highest concentration of rare plants in Maine .

" Bhurt 's Bees , whose latest line of products includes a refreshing Rosemary Mint shampoo bar ( $6 ) , vivifying Wild Lettuce toner ( $9 ) , allnatural facial powders ( $16 ) , cremes ( $9 ) and moisturizers ( $11 ) , has always included the environment in its economic equation . " You can have a successful business without compromising your values , and one of my values is the environment , " says Quimby . " I 've not had to compromise anything . " <p>
