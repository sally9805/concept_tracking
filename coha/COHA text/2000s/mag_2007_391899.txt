If there 's a remedy to the mammoth $39 billion loss General Motors logged in the third quarter , it 's sitting in a laboratory in suburban Detroit , hooked up to computers like an ICU patient . Over the past few weeks , executives have been streaming into the lab to look at the contraption  --  which may represent GM 's best chance to leapfrog competitors like Toyota and reassert its long-lost lead in the auto industry . It might even mark the start of a new automotive era  --  one that 's not reliant on gasoline . The unlikely attraction is a battery and , at roughly 300 pounds , a mighty big one . GM has pledged that just two years from now , a battery like it will power the Chevy Volt , a breakthrough car consumers will be able to charge at home like an iPod . If it works , the Volt and its potent battery could speed the replacement of traditional gas-powered engines with radical alternatives that use less fossil fuel and emit far less pollution . And if it flops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is poised to eclipse GM as the world 's biggest automaker . " We now have showdown at the OK Corral , " declares GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz . " This is about recapturing General Motors ' technological leadership . " Charged up . That starts with an unproven battery pack that engineers originally dubbed the " offensive lineman , " for its huge size and weight . When GM kicked off the project last January , it announced that the Volt would be able to travel 40 miles  --  far enough to cover most people 's daily commute  --  on a single charge , before a small gas engine kicked in . There was just one problem : Nobody had ever produced a battery that could power a car that distance , or last for the life of a car , at a reasonable cost . And critics quickly noted that GM had already blown $1 billion in the 1990s trying to build an electric vehicle that was too expensive , took too long to charge , and had no backup engine . But the Volt  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costly gasoline and turmoil in the Middle East have raised the payoff for companies that come up with petroleum alternatives . And advanced lithium ion batteries  --  the kind that power laptops and BlackBerrys  --  outperform the nickel metal hydride batteries in hybrids like the Toyota Prius . GM earlier this year contracted with two battery suppliers to offer prototypes . The first arrived at GM 's battery lab on Halloween ; others are due soon . Several months of tests will simulate 150,000 miles ' worth of driving and all the unforeseen things that can happen in a car . But GM engineers think they may have a game-changer . " It 's a breakthrough , " says Mark Verbrugge , a top GM scientist . Still , he adds , " it will be remarkable if we pull this off by 2010 . " With tighter deadlines than any GM program in 20 years , the huge automaker has streamlined procedures . " Nobody has to prepare papers prior to meetings , " Lutz says . " We make decisions on the spot . " When there are conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers within days . The car that 's emerging from this automotive Manhattan Project will be both familiar and futuristic . The Volt will look like a compact , four-door hatchback . But its underpinnings will be novel , since the whole car is being built around the huge T-shaped battery . Performance , say GM engineers , will be startling . " Takeoff will feel exceptional , " says Tony Posawatz , the Volt 's program manager . That 's because at low speeds the battery-powered electric motor will produce more torque than most gas engines  --  and be quieter , too . Fuel economy could be well over 100 miles per gallon . And charging the car from a power outlet would cost about 80 percent less than filling it with gas at $3 per gallon . GM has made bold predictions before  --  with poor results . Company executives lost credibility by insisting that hybrids were a passing fad , for instance . But this time , outside experts are impressed . " GM is not blowing smoke , " says David Cole , chairman of the nonprofit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared to death . " Plenty could still go wrong . Developing a new technology and a new vehicle at the same time leaves little margin for error , since the car 's specifications need to be locked in before some components are even fully designed . Even if the prototype batteries turn out to be flawless , mass-production factories are still in the blueprint phase . The batteries will probably be too expensive to hit the Volt 's target price of about $30,000 , which means GM will have to subsidize the units on at least 60,000 cars per year  --  its initial sales goal  --  or perhaps ask consumers to lease the battery and pay for it monthly . And other new technologies , like hydrogen fuel cells or cellulosic ethanol , could end up cheaper or more reliable . Then there is Toyota , with a proven fleet of hybrids and a formidable R &D; effort funded by profits that hit $14 billion in the past fiscal year . Instead of lithium , Toyota seems to be pursuing projects like a new plug-in Prius that can be charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its nickel batteries before the gas engine takes over . Unlike GM , however , Toyota conducts its own battery research , usually staying mum about any killer apps  --  so a surprise is possible . " Nobody should ever , ever underestimate what we 're doing , " says Bill Reinert , a Toyota engineer who oversees advanced technology . That 's a lesson GM learned once  --  and does n't want to repeat .
