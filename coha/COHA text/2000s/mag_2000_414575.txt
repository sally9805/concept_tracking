Natalie Angier I am 83 years old and have been a subscriber to Ms. since the beginning . But this is the first letter I have written to you . I want to thank the magazine for carrying me through some very difficult times , for giving me the courage to remain " a woman of independent thoughts and outrageous acts " ( thanks to Gloria Steinem ) . I really enjoyed that wonderful interview with Natalie Angier in your February/March 2000 issue . My special thanks to Marilyn Milloy for a superb writing job . I have been a dancer and teacher , and I have been observing the female body for these many years . Angier 's theories confirm all of my observations . She is truly a creative thinker . Tell her that if she should come to Israel to continue her research , I would be thrilled to give her some help . ANNE L. BARLIN KIBBUTZ EIN HASHOFET , ISRAEL Natalie Angier is not the only one who has to " take flak " for criticizing the inanities of science . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mathematical and philosophical silliness behind most claims about sex differences in intelligence , received a standing ovation of sorts , but the clapping was the sound of a door being slammed in my face . What came as a total surprise was the lack of support from other feminists , who apparently do n't want to hear about science at all , so weary are they of the success of its pseudo-varieties . Thanks for this issue-it 's my favorite of all time . I especially appreciated Marcia Ann Gillespie 's opening reflections ( " Too Close for Comfort " ) on how some of us old battle-axes from the 1960s and 1970s need to wake up and smell the coffee about our less privileged and less politically fashionable sisters in solidarity . I also loved the article on adjunct workers at colleges and universities ( - Road Scholar , " by Barbars Croft ) ! Yours , underemployed philosophy teacher and artist , JANE BRAATEN SOUTH HADLEY , MASS . Gender Kudos to Ms. for printing Erika Muhammad 's interview with Christine Vachon ( " Independent Means , " February/March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer whose films I 've greatly admired , I was alarmed by the first paragraphs description of Brandon Teena as " a woman living as a man . " At no point in Boys Do n't Cry is Teena described in those terms , and nothing I 've read about Teena indicates that he saw himself as a " woman . " Marcia Ann Gillespie writes in her editorial that failing to make lesbianism and racial and cultural diversity visible in Ms. misses an opportunity to be proactive . Similarly , failing to honor Teena 's self-presentation and self-perception misses an opportunity to acknowledge the existence and bravery of transgendered people . The mainstream media too often has misconstrued Boys Do n't Cry as a story of confused sexuality or even transvestism ; Ms. should take care to recognize and acknowledge examples of gender diversity . CLARA THALER ROSLINDALE , MASS . Hip-Hop Thank you so much for the exchange between Tara Roberts and Eisa Nefertari Ulen ( " Sisters Spin Talk on HipHop , " February/March 2000 ) . While I admire Ulen 's determination to hold rap 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skewed gender politics resonates with me . For a long time I allowed the beat to mesmerize me into acquiescence . I forgave lyrics that disregarded my friends and me as women . But at 23 , I ca n't do it anymore . I am too frustrated and even hurt by brothers in hiphop who readily denigrate sisters in their music , and by the way sisters cozy up to the misogyny when they rush onto the dance floor in clubs . Consequently , I have let rap go . In the back of my mind remains hope , however , that it will one day develop a more admirable and embracing attitude toward women instead of recycling hatred and contempt for us . MASHADI MATABANE NEW YORK , N.Y . Roberts ' and Ulen 's so-called " hiphop " article is one-sided and about only one element within hip-hop culture : rap . Hip-hop culture has many facets , but they choose to define it as the jiggy , misogynistic rap music and accompanying videos that are prevalent in the media . I want readers to know that hip-hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , the art ( graffiti ) , the music ( djing ) , and the emcee or rapper . There are thousands of people out there enjoying real hip-hop-something that the rap industry separates itself from . I am not a " hard bitch who will kill for my man , " nor am I a " fly bitch . " And I am not a " fucked-up lesbian . " I resent Roberts and Ulen insinuating that these are the only three things a woman who is into hip-hop can be ! I organize the largest hip-hop DJ battles across the U.S. I am white . I am a Sunni Muslim . We throw jams where most of the women are appropriately dressed , where no one is allowed to get on the mike and yell about " bitches and ho 's . " People of all ages and colors , and both genders enjoy themselves peacefully without any alcohol being served . We would not tolerate the " meat market " scene that Roberts and Ulen speak of How dismal ! I just want readers to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shame on Roberts and Men for saying their article was about hip-hop . It was about the rap industry ! CHRISTIE Z-PABON DMC EVENTS COORDINATOR NEW YORK , N.Y . On the Record As the founder and coordinator of the Condega Homemakers Project ( CHP ) , I was delighted that Ms. ran a story about the women 's building project started by our partner organization , the Women 's Construction Collective , in Condega , Nicaragua ( La Asociacion Colectivo de Mujeres Constructoras ) in the Women Organizing Worldwide section of the February/March 2000 issue ( " Building a Feminist Future , " by Marissa Ferrari ) . I understand that space constraints may have forced you to shorten the article significantly . However , your failure to mention the Condega Homemakers Project or away to contact or contribute to the women 's building project was a serious oversight . The article also implies that the project was funded solely by a British philanthropist , which diminishes the hard work of our volunteers , not to mention the generosity of the foundations and private donors who have financed nearly half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing out on perhaps the most inspiring aspect-that women 's groups have formed internationally in response to a call for help from a local women 's initiative in Nicaragua . Indeed , women organizing worldwide , working with Condega here in the U.S. or with the women 's brigades from Birmingham and Sheffield , England , have been helping Nicaraguan women make the construction project a reality . More information about the ongoing partnership of CHP and the collective-and how to contribute to the cause-can be found on our Web page : www.homemakers.org . MARGARITA M. SUAREZ CONDEGA HOMEMAKERS PROJECT NEW YORK , N.Y . The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence would like to thank you for your attention to the very important issue of domestic violence in your February/March 2000 issue . Women all over the world go to sleep every night and wake up every morning living with the fear of violence committed by a current or former intimate partner . The article " Hiding in Plain Sight , " by Hagar Scher , addresses this fear and also offers options to these women , while the article " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , that there are others out there like them struggling to stay safe . The safety steps outlined in Scher 's article can save a woman 's life . However , they are n't foolproof . In fact , it is important that women know that getting a new Social Security number and changing one 's name does not completely erase a woman 's past identity . Although difficult to do , her previous information can be cross-referenced with the new Social Security number and name in some computer databases , providing batterers with access to the new information . Readers should also know that supervised visitation centers , though a critical component in protecting battered women and their children , are actually available to very few women . Most communities have little or no access to such services . More funding is needed in this crucial area so that we can make supervised visitation-a lifesaving option-available to all battered women with children . We applaud your efforts to reach out to your readers and help them to stay safe . We , at the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more woman realize her options and take the necessary steps to ensure her safety and the safety of her children .

The palace had been built in stages , generations apart . Dark granite blocks comprised the oldest part , a warrior 's palace with arrow slits instead of windows : the palace of Thomas Redoubt , the Cold King , who had claimed Antyre for its own country , wresting independence from Itarus with the aid of Haith , secretive god of death and victory . <br> When the Cold King vanished into the walls of his own palace , leaving only the bodies of his family  --  wife , son , an unmarried daughter  --  behind , the claimant to the throne built a new edifice entirely , separate in style and space , leaving a sward between the two palaces . The new king built the antithesis of the Cold King 's haunted granite corridors , a sunlit series of pavilions with wide corridors and wider windows , laid nacre over every upright surface , marble over the floors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlit views for less than a year after its completion . The ambitious Lord Ixion from the House of Last , made good use of the windows , clambering through , sword in hand , and left the entire royal family gutted , the marble floors awash in blood . <br> Ixion , though aware that the country was nearly bankrupt , built his own palace , an awkward bridge between the two styles . His was constructed of sensible brick , wood , and lath and plaster ; and though the windows were wide , they could be barred and shuttered . A practical man 's palace , and it had served the family well . Six generations and the House of Last still held the throne . <br> It made it all the more galling that Janus Ixion  --  current Earl of Last , the king 's nephew , two steps from the throne , and resident of the palace  --  had been consigned to living quarters in the Cold King 's wing , along with the other undesirables . <br> Of course , it was more galling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deposited in a visitor 's salon like a recalcitrant child . <br> Janus rose from his chair , shivering as the warmth of the leather peeled away from his back . He poked idly at the low-burning fire , and twitched when the door opened behind him , let a quick swirl of cooler air spark the flames higher . <br> He did n't turn around . He did n't need to . Only one man could make free of these rooms : the Itarusine prince ascendant , Ivor Sofia Grigorian . <br> " My pet , I asked you here to play cards , not act the housekeeper . You should have asked a servant to stoke the fire for you , " Prince Ivor said . <br> " And shiver while waiting for your man to do what I could do myself ? " Janus jabbed at the scant pile of logs , satisfied when one of them crumbled into ash . It was absurd how cold the old wing was ; it approached summer outside , but inside it was as if Ivor had brought the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guards . <br> " Ever precipitate , " Ivor said , his tone indulgent as a fond uncle 's . Janus turned to accept the glass of Itarusine brandy the prince handed him , a drink unpopular in any rooms but these , which for the duration of Ivor 's tenure here , were considered to be Itarus . <br> Janus took a thoughtful sip and reseated himself . The leather chair was still warm , still shaped to his broad shoulders , and welcomed him back . " Cards , " he said . <br> " Is it so odd ? " Ivor said . " We played many such games during your years in the Winter Court . " <br> Janus frowned into the warm amber depths of the brandy , watched it wave against the clear glass like fire licking ice , and bit back comment . Many such games indeed . Prince Ivor was a true son of the Itarusine court , and nothing was ever as it seemed with him . Sit down to a game with Ivor , and rise poorer in coin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Playing any game at all with Ivor was dangerous , but not playingwell , that was worse . Ivor saved his most inventive schemes for those who thought to escape them . Even now , his dark eyes lingered on Janus , daring him to make his excuses and leave . A perfect brow arched , glossy and dark against his pale skin . <br> Ivor looked every inch the aristocrat he was , the most-favored prince of Itarus , well dressed , elegant in his silk cravat and lace cuffs , but there was nothing of softness about him . His eyes , mouth , and hands were hard . <br> When Janus had first arrived in the Winter Court , a Relict rat dumped among the aristocracy , Ivor had unaccountably offered himself as a mentor , teaching Janus the best ways to survive in a court given over to bloody-bladed politics . Later , of course , once Janus had thought more on it , he realized Ivor had seen a useful pawn going to waste , and that his " training exercises " often removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , sought peaceful darkness , then opened them , letting his gaze fall on a dusty frieze : an army in marching ranks with Haith at the rear of the column , His heavy hood obscuring His face . <br> Janus felt obscurely comforted . He might be living one level up in the old wing , surrounded by remnants of an earlier , unmourned age , but at least his rooms had been cleaned properly . <br> Ivor 's seneschal tapped on the half-open door , ushered another man in ; Janus felt his wary lassitude fail him . The blond fop , Edwin Cathcart , Lord Blythe , balked in the doorway at the sight of Janus , equally appalled ; and Ivor raised a glass to them both , a wicked smile curling his lips . <br> Two black-clad servants , directed by the seneschal , followed Blythe in , grunting under the weight of a broad , carved table . The seneschal laid a swath of indigo velvet over it , bowed to Ivor , and ushered the servants out . <br> Ivor fanned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sea , and flame , a riot of color against the inky velvet , and said , " Now that the players are here , shall we begin ? " <br> A sudden draft made the lamplight flicker , a breeze strong enough that the air coiled into the glass chimneys and battered the flames . Smoke sifted up in spidery trails , adding the sharp scent of burning wicks to a room already hazy with smoke . Janus fought down the undignified tickle in his throat that wanted to turn him red faced and spluttering . Were they not closeted in the old wing of the castle , he would demand a window be opened to let out the smoke , but the arrow slits and tight-mortared stone had n't been designed with comfort in mind . <br> " By the gods , Blythe , is n't it enough we had to endure Challacombe smoking those foul cigarillos at the table ? I thought you too proud to ape a commoner . " Janus laid down his card with a decided snap . The seven of earth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new card was earth again but more suited to the rest of his hand , the jack of earth , a man in a coffin . He filed it beside the jacks of air and fire . <br> Blythe 's narrow lips tightened around his pipe at being compared to King Aris 's common-born spymaster , but he made no retort , instead folding his hand . Janus believed the man was constitutionally unable to think at all . It made it all the more peculiar that Ivor had invited the young fop to play with them . Unless Blythe had invited himself , the Duchess of Love 's stalking horse , in an attempt to curry favor with Ivor . <br> Janus washed the crackle of tobacco fumes out of his throat with a swallow of brandy . <br> " Perhaps he merely hopes to confound us with smoke , " Ivor said . " Maze our vision , and so gain an advantage . He needs some aid at play  --  surely you agree with that , my pet . " He flashed a quick , saturnine grin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I wonder you invited me to play at all , if it was only to treat me to insult . " His pipe stem , held between clenched teeth , cracked , and the barrel tipped , shedding sparks and dottle . He slapped quickly at his chest and cravat , leaving tiny singe marks in the fine lace and brocade of his vest . <br> Janus traded bad temper for a quick and silent snort of amusement . " I wonder myself , but the ways of Itarusine princes are mysterious indeed . " <br> Though he saw Blythe 's choler rise , a hot flush on thin cheeks above the elaborate knots of his cravat , Janus 's attention was all for Ivor , watching that tiny quirk of a smile , blossomed and gone , and entirely malevolent . It reminded him of a night spent in the Winter Court in an accommodating lady 's boudoir . Janus had raised his gaze from the sweat-damp juncture of Marya 's neck and shoulder , her hands still clawing at his back , and found Ivor watching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace . He had reached out , rested his hand on Janus 's nape , a warm , possessive touch , even as Janus gave his final attentions to Marya with a shuddering gasp and groan . <br> The pleasure , Janus knew , was n't for watching the act itself but at Janus doing something well . <br> Seeing the same pleased smile on Ivor 's face over their shared complicity in Blythe 's setdown unsettled his nerves . He felt a ghostly hand touch his skin , the weight of memory . When Ivor was this smug , trouble was sure to follow . <br> " But three is the ideal number for a game , " Ivor said . He poured Janus another generous measure of brandy ; Janus resolved not to drink it . <br> " If only two are seated , " Ivor continued , " then they must be opponents by default , no matter their inclinations . But three  --  three allows men to choose alliances as they may . " <br> " Allows you to work together to lighten my purse , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my smoke , my presence so objectionable , I could think of other places to be , Last . Were I you , and wed to such a tidy handful as Psyke Bellane , I 'd find better pursuits than sitting to games with your fellows . <br> " Janus sighed , and sipped the brandy more slowly this time . Blythe was an idiot and the comment ? was n't worth a reply . His marriage might be a matter of politics instead of passion , but Psyke and he dwelled together respectfully enough . Janus turned his attention back to the pasteboards in his hand , waiting Ivor 's turn . <br> He felt as if he 'd been waiting for Ivor to show his hand all evening . <br> The prince was more than a simple foreign delegate , more even than the newest Itarusine auditor come to ensure the treaty between their two countries was upheld . Ivor might be a loyal son of Itarus , but his ambitions were bigger than playing warden to the Antyrrian finances ; Janus had no evidence of it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize in mind as himself : the Antyrrian throne . But their reasons , Janus thought , were utterly at odds . He knew his own : to see Antyre brought out of the stagnation it had been forced into by the Xipos treaty and by King Aris 's neglect . <br> Ivor 's reasons likely centered around his drive for power . <br> Ivor smiled , and set down a card of his own , the queen of air , Black-Winged Ani , the goddess of love and vengeance ; all Janus 's musings derailed on a sudden wave of pain and anger . <br> Maledicte had been gone nearly nine months , borne away by Ani 's hatred of cages and Maledicte 's own frustration with being locked away at Janus 's country estate , a treasonous secret . <br> Janus set a silver coin , the Antyrrian luna , into the center of the small pile , and laid out his cards . Ivor dropped an Itarusine coin onto the cloth , and fanned his cards with a showman 's gesture . A losing hand . One he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Blythe , annoyed at being ignored , relit his pipe with deliberate emphasis , and said , " I suppose you might shun your wife 's company at that , though . It would be all manner of awkward were you to seek her and find her bed already filled . Aris seems quite taken  --  " <br> " Aris is our king , " Janus said . He collected his winnings , the pasteboards , tucking Ani 's card into the rest as if it meant nothing to him at all . " Respect is owed him . " <br> " Nicely won , my pet , " Ivor said . " When I recall your first attempts at the game , I grow amazed . " <br> " There is nothing amazing about progress , " Janus said , more shortly than he had meant , but he grew weary of Ivor 's teasing . Instead , he shuffled the cards neatly , dealt them out , noting that Ivor and he had nearly equal piles of coins , even five hands in , while Blythe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering ash from his clothes onto the velvet , eager for another hand . Janus eyed him and sighed . " What I find far more remarkable is the failure to improve . " <br> " Agreed , " Ivor said . The hand played out , but after the second round of bid and show , Ivor put his palm over the pile when Blythe would have added his coin on the third . " Our round , I think , Blythe . If Janus ? does n't hold the suite of high fire , collected entirely from your carelessness , he is not the man I thought him . " <br> " I suppose you would know , " Blythe said . <br> Janus eyed the cards in his hands , the red wash of flame in all its guises , and tried to ignore Blythe . His temper , sparked by Ivor 's trick with the queen card , was souring by the moment . <br> Blythe 's tone shifted uglier as Ivor shut him out of the game . " I had heard , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this . Perhaps your wife is not the only one to seek companionship outside her marriage ; but at least , if she is indiscreet , she can not be considered disloyal to the crown . <br> " Janus sucked in a furious breath but restrained himself . He was a king 's counselor , albeit one in some disgrace , and he had a reputation to uphold . Still , he wanted nothing more than to break his goblet , then use the sharp edge to carve out the man 's endlessly offensive tongue . <br> " Do you intend to provoke him to a duel , Blythe ? " Ivor asked . " Do you believe the duchess 's support allows you to make such insinuations ? I warn you , it does not . Should Janus accept the challenge , I will act his second with pleasure . <br> " Blythe 's hands on the table clenched . There was a brief spurt of panic in his eyes that Janus enjoyed . He had had enough of the lordling 's blatant dislike , and the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , no challenge . Edwin Cathcart , Lord Blythe , was a slight young man , prone to talk over action , and even that was clumsy in execution . <br> Continues ...
