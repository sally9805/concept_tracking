Few political appointees are as well connected as Janet Rehnquist . A former White House staff member for the first President Bush , she 's the daughter of Chief Justice William Rehnquist  --  whose Supreme Court ensured there would be a second President Bush . No surprise that 16 months ago , she got a job as inspector general at the Health and Human Services ( HHS ) Department . But her connections may be wearing thin . The General Accounting Office ( GAO ) began an investigation in October into charges that she has mismanaged the office . Among the allegations : that she forced out a number of senior career staff members , improperly kept a gun in her office and ran up questionable travel bills . She is also under fire for delaying an audit of a Florida pension fund at the request of a top aide to Governor Jeb Bush . <P> Now , sources tell TIME , GAO investigators have discovered that documents potentially important to the inquiry have been shredded . The investigators are focusing on the possible destruction of notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Rehnquist has denied that anything of significance was shredded , but the discovery prompted Rehnquist 's general counsel to pen a Thanksgiving-week e-mail urging HHS staff to stop shredding . <P> The incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Charles Grassley , has been critical of Rehnquist . But fellow Republican member Orrin Hatch , for whom she once worked , has asked Grassley to be kept " up to speed " on the inquiry . Grassley has only increased the pressure , complaining to her White House sponsors that they need to take the matter seriously , sources say . Translation : Find her another job .  --  By Michael Weisskopf and Viveca Novak
