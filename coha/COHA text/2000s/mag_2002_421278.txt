American corporations want to raise a new generation of engineers-by helping kids play . // Three scientists at the North Pole are trapped on an iceberg with two ferocious polar bears . Team O.R.E.O. 's job is to maneuver a robot to rescue the scientists without harming the bears . It must also recover a medical-supply crate that 's about to plunge into the ocean and transport 15 fuel barrels to a new storage hut because the old hut is threatened by a crack in the ice . They have two minutes . Okay , okay-so the polar bears are really Lego bricks . Ditto the iceberg . And the robot . But according to industry giants like 3M , General Motors , and Motorola , nothing short of the future of America 's economic competitiveness is at stake . Team O.R.E.O. is made up of six 11- and 12-year-old boys with buzz cuts who meet twice a week in a Chicago suburb to design and build robots that resemble something out of Luke Skywalker 's toy chest . They sit around retired Motorola engineer Charlie Schmitz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a white board . Only days after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , this year 's " arctic challenge " was unveiled over the Internet for members of Team O.R.E.O. and 20,000 other youths nationwide who participate in a littleleague robotics competition . Cynthia Schmitz says she was relieved that her son , Andy , 11 , had " something to lose himself in . " Even in Arlington Heights , Ill. , kids were feeling the pain personally . The father of one of Team O.R.E.O. 's members often worked with bond traders at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 104th floor of the WTC 's North Tower ; 600 of Cantor 's 1,000 employees were killed . The father ended up hospitalized for stress . // Robotics competitions are like science fairs , but require participants to actively apply their knowledge and contend against their peers . This year , 20,000 children will compete in 45 states . // The first strategy meeting of Team O.R.E.O. came as a welcome respite for the boys , old enough to understand what had happened but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration . Gathered in the Schmitzes ' living room , they channeled that energy into designing , building , and programming a robot to complete a set of assigned tasks faster and better than any other team they came up against . That includes Team Apache , their archrivals in the next town over , who have been breathing down their necks two years running . In the process of building a robot using Legos , those multicolored plastic building blocks invented by a Danish carpenter in the 1930s , kids are learning complicated engineering concepts , strategic planning , and team building . Team O.R.E.O. 's members decide they first want to go for the medical crate , because it 's worth 50 points and there 's only one crate up for grabs between two competing teams . " That 's so the other team ca n't get it , " explains Keith Mier , 12 , , a seventh-grader at Thomas Middle School . Andy Schmitz says they may build a long arm they can program to swing out and retrieve the crate . Then they may go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team meeting comes to an end , it 's time to talk about this weekend 's sleepover and eat some chocolate cake . But do n't mistake this for child 's play . This is sport for the brainy , not brawny , based on a product the Lego Company unveiled in 1998 to allow kids to write computer software that programs behavfor ( such as throwing balls , picking up objects , or rolling around the floor ) into its trademark building bricks . The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System is a $200 kit that comes with 700 pieces . The brain of the Mindstorms products is the RCX , an autonomous microcomputer developed by Lego and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab that can be programmed using a PC . Lego 's own " master builders " have created robots that do everything from cooking on a stove to dealing cards . Mindstorms has a cult following among adults , who bought 70 percent of the kits sold in the first year they were available . In fact , its underlying code was hacked , and legions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the system was designed for 12year-olds , and it helped spawn a new sport that could spark an interest in a technology career . The FIRST Lego League is a partnership started in 1998 between Lego and FIRST ( For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology ) , a nonprofit organization in Manchester , N.H. , dedicated to getting kids interested in science and engineering . FIRST hopes to encourage youngsters to admire someone other than Kobe Bryant or Britney Spears-for example , someone like Rolf Kowalewski , who recently retired after 35 years with Motorola , where he designed two-way radio systems . For his 65th birthday , Kowalewski got a Mindstorms kit and started mentoring Team O.R.E.O. Among his proteges is Matt Hill , 12 , who 's in seventh grade . " I once wanted to be an underwater biologist . Then I wanted to be a test pilot . And there was a phase when I wanted to be a paleontologist and dig up dinosaurs , " Hill says matter-of-factly , as if the names of his favorite TV programs were rolling off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrodynamic or aeronautical engineer . " Talk like that makes the sponsors proud . Motorola Inc. is behind Team O.R.E.O. and 60 other teams in the FIRST Lego League in Illinois . In December , for the third year running , General Motors will host the championship for the league in Michigan . Kimberly Clark will do the same in Wisconsin , where its North American manufacturing is based . In Minnesota , parents started a nonprofit group and raised more than $100,000 from Honeywell , 3M , Medtronic , and others to fund 40 Lego teams and a slew of regional tournaments . NASA , which spends more than $500,000 a year funding nearly 150 robotics teams , this year helped form 15 Lego teams among the Choctaw Indians on the Pearl River Reservation in Mississippi . The space agency recognizes that the shortage of engineers-particularly in robotics-will become acute as manufacturing everything from cars to candy packaging becomes more automated , so it 's reaching out to underrepresented populations . " I 'm out there to play the numbers , " says Dave Lavery , NASAs program executive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League advisory council . " If I support 4,000 high school kids per year and 5 percent of them get advanced degrees of some sort , maybe there will be 200 kids available to me to hire in 10 years . That 's better than 12 . " The corporate stalwarts are dipping into their pockets to get more than community goodwill . They also see a potential solution to the engineering crisis facing America . For too long , U.S. engineering schools have n't been producing enough engineers ; the rate peaked in the 1980s at 75,000 per year , but has now dropped to around 64,000 , according to the American Society for Engineering Education . The engineer shortage is at the heart of many current public policy decisions , from granting more visas to highly skilled foreigners who come to the United States to putting stronger emphasis on math and science in high schools . Could the answer be as simple as encouraging kids to build robots with Legos ? " Engineering schools are graduating less than half the engineers the industry is going to need in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April as executive director of General Motors ' North American proving grounds and test operations . The unit has been supporting high school robotics teams for six years and more recently began supporting Lego tournaments . McEwan adds , " We 've been in it long enough to have people go through the robotics league cycle , go to college , and come back to work . " Still , many schoolchildren still think an engineer just drives a train . " Kids do n't see engineers on TV . They see firemen , doctors , and lawyers , " notes Randy Maiers , director of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers ' Education Foundation , which distributes up to $2 million annually to engineering education programs . FIRST is trying to change public perception of those who spit out square roots as easily as TV stars say " Objection , your honor . " Inside the Lego League , where engineer " coaches " mentor many of the teams , youngsters see how engineers apply scientific and mathematical principles to solve technical problems . The solutions may be as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can make sharp turns more easily . " If we celebrate basketball players and pay them $100 million to play for a few years , young people will try to become basketball players , " says Woodie Flowers , a mechanical engineering professor at MIT , who started an undergraduate design competition that serves as the model for many of the competitive robotics leagues springing up coast to coast . ( He 's also co-chair of FIRST ) " If young people do n't know who won the Nobel Prize , " he adds , " how will they know what to aspire to ? " This focus on the serious side of Legos may be coming at just the right time for America 's youth . Says FIRST chairman Jim Utaski , a former vice president at Johnson &; Johnson , " There 's definitely a sense among them of less frivolity , less joyriding in the car and more of a sense that they 'd better pay attention in school . " In another suburban Chicago neighborhood , where Team Apache is meeting on Tom Kleinschmidt 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescuing those scientists from the iceberg at the North Pole . Last year , when the challenge involved a volcanic eruption in Hawaii that threatened a nearby village , Team O.R.E.O. beat them at the regional and state competitions . The year before , in the play-offs , bright overhead lights triggered their robot 's light sensor , causing it to crash into the wall . " It was a big disappointment , " says John Klinger , 12 , a seventh-grader at MacArthur Middle School in Prospect Heights , Ill . " But we recovered well , " teammate and classmate Derek Kleinschmidt , 12 , reminds him . ( They placed second , anyway. ) // Last year 's FIRST competition required students to build robots that could save a village in Hawaii from a volcanic eruption . But not all of the goals were mechanical . FIRST also included an essay contest . // " Yeah , well , " Klinger continues , " I 've vowed to beat them this year . " As they discuss strategy , Team Apache considers reusing one of signature devices-the Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way that their robot did n't even have to leave its base to accomplish such tasks as depositing a sensor in the active volcano before it erupted , earning 15 points . The state competition is the Superbowl of science fairs . There are medals , referees , and even cheerleaders . Teams have 12 weeks to build radio-controlled robots from identical kits before they compete . Each year , a new challenge is announced , spelling out tasks for the robots to complete , the topography of the playing table , and ways to earn extracurricular honors . Last year , for example , Task Force One , from the suburbs of St. Paul , won the essay-writing contest . " One of the girls told me that the competition made her enjoy science because she got to imagine going new places , such as a volcano in Hawaii , " says Lynn Bick , the " team mother " of Task Force One . As their prize , the entire team did get to fly to Hawaii to visit a real volcano . Each year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design specialized accessory kits that each team purchases to use with their Mindstorms set . The cost for a team to participate is relatively low  --  between $600 and $700-compared with that for sophisticated high school robotics competitions , where teams spend thousands of dollars . In the 1998 Lego League tourney , 2,000 children in seven states participated . This year , 20,000 children-among them a growing number of girls-are competing in 45 states . The Lego League was originally developed to complement the pioneering FIRST Robotics Competition , started in 1992 in a Manchester , N.H. , gym . Last year , that robotics contest  --  featuring more than 500 teams and 25,000 high school students-was held at the sold-out 15,000-seat EPCOT Center in Orlando , and broadcast on ESPN . The group 's sponsors read like a Who 's Who of the Fortune 500 : Baxter International , Delphi Automotive Systems , DaimlerChrysler Corp. , General Motors , Johnson &; Johnson , and Xerox CorD .. to name a few . Building a robot for the FIRST Robotics Competition is a sophisticated feat : The kit costs several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by FIRST officials using supplies often donated by sponsors-from wheelchair wheels to motorcycle batteries to air compressors . One kit might include three different motors-one from a drill , one that runs the electric window in a car door , and one from a Fisher-Price toy Jeep . Software maker AutoDesk donates its commercially available Inventor software to 600 high schools each year so that students can design their robots and docuwent the engineering process . In a 1998 survey , FIRST , which tracks the impact of the high-school-level competition , found that 81% of the parents of participants said they thought the competition influenced students to pursue a scientific or technical career . That was one of the first measures of the power of these programs to stimulate interest in math , science , and engineering . Other signs have been anecdotal : Of the 10 graduating seniors on math teacher Eric Reed 's robotics team at DeAnza High School in El Sobrante , Calif. , six are going on to study computer science or engineering . One student , Geoffrey Snow , 17 , enrolled at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before joining the robotics team two years ago , the closest Snow had come to engineering was playing with a remote-controlled car . In 2001 , his team finished fourth out of 52 teams in the Silicon Valley competition . " There was a lot of compromising and trying to figure out what would work , " he says . " I liked the teamwork aspect best . " Even when competing , members of Team O.R.E.O. and Team Apache root for one another . Underlying their rivalry is mutual respect . The two former Motorola colleagues who formed the teams-Schmitz and Kleinschmidt  --  decided to get them together before big meets to demonstrate their robots . Each time they do , team members often see some feature they 'd like to incorporate into their own robot . Last year , Team O.R.E.O. was impressed by Team Apache 's speed and decided to push the accelerator ; Team Apache liked the way Team O.R.E.O. 's robot was aligned to the wall with a roller to make sure it went in the right direction . This year , even while Team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to get the medical crate , Kleinschmidt 's son Derek contemplates that 50-point feat at Team Apache 's backporch meeting . " Knowing O.R.E.O. , " he sighs , " they 'll do something ultimately crazy and beat us again . We could get all 340 points , and they could get all 340 points , and it could come down to that medical crate balancing in the middle of the two playing fields . " It will be a great contest , and may even be broadcast on ESPN . Whatever the outcome , the players will have the attention of corporate scouts .
