Miriam Makeba 's voice is as majestic and contoured as the Magaliesberg , a range of sloping grassy peaks near her home city of Johannesburg , South Africa . Makeba 's nickname is " Mama Africa , " and rightfully so . You can hear her homeland in her voice . As she lags behind a beat , drawing out emotion , one feels the weight of apartheid bearing down . Caught up in one of her forceful , husky glissandos , it 's hard not to imagine soaring above the lush expanse of the African veld . <P> Many of today 's female singers are content to paint their songs in two primary colors : blue longing or red lust . Makeba 's palette is richer : scarlet shades of outrage , cerulean hues of optimism , sable determination . And while other singers paint self-portraits , Makeba , 68 , paints vocal landscapes as well . Starting in the 1950s , she helped popularize " African jazz , " a melding of jazz with traditional African folk music . In doing so , she helped create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also captured a region 's culture and traditions . <P> Makeba 's new CD , Homeland ( Putumayo ) , her first album of new material in more than six years , is a musical love letter to African culture ( one song is titled Africa Is Where My Heart Lies ) . From the beginning of her career , she has been fearless in singing and speaking about Africa . In 1960 , because of her outspokenness about political repression in South Africa , the apartheid regime invalidated her passport . " When I came out to the U.S. , I was n't even aware that people would think I was a politician or I was talking or singing politics , " says Makeba . " To me , I was just telling the truth about where I come from . " <P> Exiled for 30 years , she established herself as an international star , recording with Harry Belafonte ( their collaboration won a Grammy ) , singing for President John F. Kennedy ( she performed the same night in 1962 that Marilyn Monroe cooed Happy Birthday ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumultuous  --  she 's been married to South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and American black-power activist Stokely Carmichael . Now single , she laughs and says she is " too old to marry again . " In 1990 , after Nelson Mandela 's release from prison , Makeba returned to South Africa . On Homeland Makeba 's music sounds timeless and tireless . The succulent African pop songs are in English and in Xhosa ( Makeba 's native tongue ) . The first track , Masakhane , is a stirring call " for unity and hope in the postapartheid era . " Another track , Lindelani , is a gentle ballad written for and named after her great-grandson . <P> On this record and in person , Makeba radiates an empathy that is at once regal and motherly . She is concerned but hopeful about her country 's future . " I think our people should be commended , " she says . " After inheriting all the problems our government inherited from the apartheid era , they tried their best . Change is slow because there 's no money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are trying to live together and move forward is impressive . " Impressive too that after three decades of exile and half a decade of layoff , Makeba could make music as gracious and giving as Homeland .
