When we published Eugene Mirabelli 's " The Only Known Jump Across Time " in the Sept. 2003 issue , we acknowledged that it was n't so much a work of science fiction as it was a tale with science as its subject . Reader reactions to the story were very good , so we think you 'll like this new tale as well . It 's a bit hard to classify , this one is , but it 's definitely fiction , it has some speculation about science , and it 's a joy to read-is that enough for all of you ? After having taught writing at SUNY-Albany for many years , Mr. Mirabelli is now retired and living in upstate New York . His latest novel , The Passion of Terri Heart , was published late last year . <p> 1 CHRDINGER : LIFE AND Thought was written by Walter Moore and published by Cambridge University Press in 1989 . It 's a superb book , giving a detailed and dramatic narrative of Erwin Schrdinger 's life and a lucid explication of his ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of his philosophical speculations as well . The author presents the world in which Schrdinger lived , his home , the places where he taught , the intellectual milieu around him - his passions , his friendships , and the many women he loved . This is the book that Amy Bellacqua was reading . Amy was twenty-eight and worked as a waitress at the Capri on Santa Cruz Avenue in Menlo Park . She had never been especially interested in physics but , as she said , she had nothing against it either . Furthermore , she liked biography and felt this one was good . Mostly good . It did have some fancy-looking equations , but they did n't interrupt the flow of the story . Let me be frank - Amy was reading Schrdinger : Life and Thought because the young man who had moved into the apartment upstairs was getting his Ph.D . in physics and she wanted to be able to talk to him about something he liked the next time they met in the laundry room or the parking space out back . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Amy on the first floor , John Artopoulos on the second . John was twenty-eight and was finishing a dissertation in theoretical physics at Stanford . In high school he had been a whiz at science , and as a college freshman he had picked up a tattered paperback copy of George Gamow 's Thirty Years that Shook Physics and that book led to his becoming a physicist . He liked the informal style of the writing , and he was intrigued by Gamow 's drawings and most especially by his photographs - snapshots of Niels Bohr and his wife roaring off on a motorcycle , Werner Heisenberg taking a swim , a bare-chested Enrico Fermi swatting at a tennis ball , and Gamow himself with Wolfgang Pauli on a Swiss lake steamboat . Those people knew each other , got drunk together , sang songs , and together developed quantum mechanics ; he wanted to be part of that , wanted to join them . Now he was overworked and was beginning to wonder if that great sense of fun and friendship had gone out of physics . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linear Accelerator ( SLAC ) , or in his lonely apartment , or away at Heidi Egret 's studio north of Berkeley . Heidi was twenty-eight , an artist , a painter . Of course she was still too young to be famous , but her reputation was growing , and recently California Spectrum had listed her as one of the ten younger artists to keep an eye on . Her work had evolved rapidly , keeping pace with changes in the art market , and though she was not always in the spotlight she was usually nearby . She was best known for those abstract paintings in which she used a pointillist technique she called pixel transformation . People differed about Heidi 's work and whether it was advanced or merely an updated version of Seurat 's theories from a century ago , and some even debated whether it was well done or not . But everyone agree that Heidi , who had spent some years as a surfer , was a knockout . John had met Heidi at a beach party one Saturday afternoon and had been dazzled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met John . Amy had been in the little parking area out back of the yellowish stucco house , trying to wedge a couple of tables into her small car . She had rolled the round table into place , its legs tilted up onto the back seat , but was having a hard time lifting and positioning the oblong table . Furthermore , she was getting hot . She rested one end of the table on the car seat and with her free hand she grabbed up the bottom edge of her jersey , mopping the sweat from her eyes just as the young man from upstairs came around the corner of the house in beach shorts and sunglasses , a duffle bag under his arm . He tossed the duffle bag into his car , then turned to her . " Can I help ? " he asked , taking off his glasses . " I hope so ! " she said . It took a while , but together they were able to get both tables in . " Thanks , " Amy said , taking the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling with the tables . " The tile makes them a little heavy , " she explained , then immediately regretted telling him the obvious . " They look good , the tiles . Very colorful . " Amy was uncomfortably aware that her damp jersey was cringing to her breasts . " Oh . Well . Thanks . I 'm taking them to sell at a flea market . Actually . " She smiled and waited for him to turn away so she could leave without being rude , but instead he said , " My name 's John Artopoulos , " and he put out his hand and she shook it and said , " I 'm Amy Bellacqua . " He asked her if she worked at the flea market and she laughed and said , " No , I just go there when I have something to sell . I 'm waitressing , mostly . What about you ? " she asked . " I 'm working on a dissertation in physics . " " That sounds interesting . " " Does it ? " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure I do . " He laughed . " But it never sounds interesting to other people . " They talked of this and that for a brief while , then said goodbye and went their separate ways , John to the beach party and Amy to the flea market where she came across Schrdingei : Life and Thought and , after leafing through a few pages , she bought it . 3 John saw Heidi Egret 's paintings on their second date . " I like the colors in this one , " he said . " What 's it about ? I mean , what 's it a picture of ? " Heidi had n't answered , so he turned to where she was seated cross-legged on her pink exercise mat , brushing out the tangles John 's frenzied embraces had made in her pale blond hair . " I did n't ask you to explain string theory . Right ? " she said petulantly . " Right , " he said . " And you should n't ask me to explain my paintings . It always confuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we going to do next ? Do you want a cigarette or something ? " From his first sight of Heidi at the beach party John thought of her as the quintessential California girl . She had a tattoo on her right shoulder blade that other people might think was a devil 's pitchfork but which John saw as a trident , symbol of the sea god Poseidon . He had grown up in Massachusetts and had never met anyone like her - not just her looks - he 'd never met anyone so open and easy going , so laid back . He called her his California , or his Californienne , which he meant as an endearment , but it annoyed Heidi , not simply because she was from Oregon but because , as she informed him on their third date , she was n't his . She was a free spirit and did n't belong to him or to anyone . " Are you angry with me ? " he asked . He had just driven up from Menlo Park and his knapsack slumped from his hand to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the bedroom and make up if you want , " she said , brightening . " It beats talking . " That 's how it was with John and Heidi . The only reason he was n't with her all the time was that his research fellowship kept him at SLAC , down in Menlo Park , and her half-time teaching at Contemporary Arts kept her up north of Berkeley , a long drive . Her studio , with its big slanted skylight , was a happier place than his desolate apartment , so each weekend John drove up to her place . The weekends took time away from his dissertation , which had come to a halt , but he hoped his work was going to go better since meeting Heidi. 4 One weekend Heidi went up to Oregon to visit her stepfather . " After all , he 's paying the rent here . I owe him a visit now and then , " she had told John . The weekend Heidi went to Oregon was the same weekend Amy Bellacqua asked John about something she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the back steps reading the book when John came around the corner to his car carrying a red plastic bucket . She watched as he began to roll up his car windows , then she slid the book behind her and called out , " Hi ! " He turned and saw her . " I 've decided to wash my car , " he said . " Just to see what color it really is . " He came to the steps , turned on the garden faucet and let the water run into his red bucket , then turned it almost off while he tried to think up a way to engage her . " Actually , I think mine 's dirtier , " Amy said . John crouched by the bucket , the throat of his shirt hanging open , and she saw his chest hair . " I 've got a couple of sponges . You can borrow my soap , if you want , " he offered , catching Amy unaware as she gazed thoughtfully at his chest . " What ? Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . " I 'll go get dressed in something that it wo n't matter if I get it soaked . " She snatched up the book and ducked inside the door , tore off her blouse and jeans , pulled on a pair of old cutoffs and a black Grateful Dead T-shirt . But she never much liked the Grateful Dead , did n't want him to think she did , so she tore it off , started to pull on an another but remembered it said Boys lie ! , clawed it off , tossed aside Jesus is coming . Look busy ! and pulled on the white one that displayed a steaming cup of coffee - The Daily Grind , Albany , New York . Then she raced back outside to where John was soaping his car . They washed their cars , all the while talking about the kinds of people you meet at flea markets or at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and about movies they liked and whether you 'd want to live in San Francisco even if you could afford it , talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his car he helped rinse Amy 's . When they were finished , he put his sponges and soaps into his bucket while she coiled the garden hose . And that was that , car washing was over . Amy went indoors feeling elated and disappointed at the same time , which was very confusing . She showered and decided it would not be smart to get involved with somebody who lived right upstairs . She got dressed feeling very clear headed . Then John knocked at her door and asked did she want to get something to eat and she said yes . They drove in John 's freshly washed car , which now showed all its rust , and they ate at a deli . John asked Amy where she waitressed and she told him about the Capri restaurant on Santa Cruz which , she said , was n't big but she liked her job there . It happened that John knew something about restaurants , too . " My parents have a restaurant , a Greek restaurant , in Boston . That 's where I 'm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told her . " What ? Me ? No , no , no ! " She laughed . " That old T-shirt comes from New York . But I grew up outside Sacramento . My dad teaches high school science . My mom 's a guidance counselor . I 'm just all California , nothing else . What 's it like in Massachusetts ? " Amy asked him . John had spent summers working on a lobster boat when he was in college , and Amy had spent those same summers as a life guard on the beach . They talked and talked and talked much longer than they realized and would have gone on talking forever if John had n't suddenly remembered - " Damn ! I just remembered ! " - that he had to go over to his office before five . So they drove back to their yellowish stucco apartment house . As they turned into their street John was feeling exhilarated and oddly light-headed , as if he had been drinking wine all afternoon and not simply talking with Amy . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm reading this book about Schrdinger . " " You are ? " " Yes . I found it at the flea market . I 'm up to the part where he develops those wave equations . And I was wondering - " She broke off . " Wondering what ? " " Schrdinger was married , you know , but in the middle of winter during the Christmas holidays he went off to the Swiss mountains and shacked up with this woman and that 's when he did it . " " Did what ? " " Did everything . For two whole weeks all he did was make love to this woman and write those equations . " " Really ? That 's the way it happened ? " He did n't know whether to believe her or not . " It 's in the book . But nobody knows the woman 's name . Nobody can figure out who she was . " " I did n't know any of this , " he said , clearly surprised . " What I want to know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the equations ? " He glanced sideways at Amy to see if she were serious . " No , " he said . " I think so , " said Amy , agreeable and firm . They rolled to a stop in front of their apartment house . John shook his head , no , and turned to her as if he were about to say something - his mouth even opened a bit - but nothing came out . " Yes . I think she must be in there somewhere , " Amy said . Then she hopped out of the car , turned and smiled at John . They both said it was a great car wash and lunch , then they waved and John drove off , telling himself , " Do n't get involved with a crazy woman , no matter how great she looks . " 5 Heidi taught part-time at Contemporary Arts , north of Berkeley , and she told John how much she despised her job . " It 's a second-rate art school with third-rate students , " she said . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach on the pink exercise mat . " They 're so materialistic , I mean utterly . The idea of art for art 's sake , the idea of pure art , it 's beyond them . All they care about is money . A lot of them have part-time jobs and come to class so tired they fall asleep . I mean , they really doze off . They say they want to be artists and then they turn around and ask me how to make art pay , like I cared , or something . - Now do up by my shoulders , " she said , giving directions to John , who was massaging her dark blond back , a complex surface which he thought more engaging than any dreamed of by Euclid , especially with its little trident tattoo . " Why do n't you quit your job and come down to my place ? " he said , pausing to add a few more drops of oil to his hands . " We 'd starve on what you make . " " We could take turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his massage . " I could eat on Monday , Wednesday and Friday . You could eat on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . We both could eat on Sunday . " " Hey ! Are you saying I 'm fat ? You 're not saying I 'm fat , are you ? " Heidi had raised her head and twisted around to look at him , frowning . " No , no , no ! That 's not what I meant . " She relaxed and turned away , resting her cheek on her folded arms . " Anyhow , you 'll be making plenty next year after you graduate . We can wait , " she told him . " I 'll be a post-doc next year . Post-docs are slaves . " " Now my feet , " she said . " You always forget to do my feet . " John took her to her favorite restaurant , a fancy place with soft music and dim lights , the table illuminated by five low candles floating in a shallow bowl of water . Over the lemon sorbet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " After I get my doctorate I 'm a post-doc . I 'll get a post-doc research job someplace . Those can go on for two or three years , or longer . Post-docs do really advanced research , but they get paid as if they were still grad students . I have to do post-doc work first to get a really good position later . That 's all . " " Oh , " Heidi said at last , her eyes soft with sympathy . She slid a hand across the table and gently laced her fingers through his . " I 'm so sorry . " 6 The next Friday Heidi phoned John , reached him on his cell phone as he was speeding from Menlo Park to her place . " Do n't come . I 've got to visit galleries all weekend , " she told him . So John turned around , drove languidly back home to work on his dissertation . Actually , he did n't feel like working on his dissertation , so he thought he 'd knock on Amy 's door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their little parking area he saw a handsome red sports car in his place beside Amy 's car . He parked on the margin of brown grass , looked at the leather-and-mahogany cockpit of the Alfa Romeo , heard rock music from Amy 's apartment and trudged upstairs to his desk , hoping it would rain into the sports car . Around midnight he heated three slices of frozen pizza in the microwave and ate dinner at the sink , returned to his desk and two hours later fell asleep over his equations . Saturday morning he pulled up his kitchen window shade and saw the red Alfa Romeo was still there , but when he went out it was mercifully gone . He crawled into his rusted car and drove to his cell at SLAC and worked for fifteen hours . Sunday morning he took a long hot shower , stared out his kitchen window a while at his car and Amy 's , side by side , drove out and bought a fat newspaper , drove aimlessly this way and that , then headed back home and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out for breakfast or brunch . Her face lighted up . " Come in . I 'll make us something , " she said . " I was hoping you 'd stop by . " Her place was a maze of greenery , a jungle - potted flowers crowded the window sills , mossy baskets hung from the ceiling and overflowed with blossoms , trays of pale green sprouts lay underfoot , and luminous mosaic tiled tables stood here and there and there amid the leaves , and mosaic figures looked out from the walls , and here 's a work bench packed with jars and miniature saws and grinding wheels and pocketed trays with heaps of tesserae that glowed like gemstones . " This is amazing ! This is beautiful ! " John said . " And this ! And this ! " he said , ducking and weaving among the plants and mosaics . " This is wonderful ! " " Thanks , " Amy said . " Do you like waffles ? Orpancakes ? Or eggs ? Or cornflakes ? Or what ? " " The tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Were really amateurish , " Amy said . " I made them when I was still a student at Contemporary Arts - a school you never heard of-and I was keeping them for sentimental reasons . But I 've run out of space . " " Pancakes would be nice , " said John . They ate in the kitchen . John set the table , sliced a cantaloupe and read newspaper bulletins to Amy while she whipped the batter and poured it onto the griddle . Over the pancakes he asked her why she had n't told him she was an artist . " Full-time waitress , part-time artist , " she explained . " I 've had a few shows in some Bay Area galleries and a couple down in Santa Cruz . I love what I 'm doing , I just wish I could do it all the time . " They talked through brunch , talked while Amy washed the dishes and John wiped them , talked and talked and suddenly decided to drive off in Amy 's car , drive anywhere , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equations he had concocted from a gedanken experiment . " What 's a gedanken experiment ? " she asked him . " It 's where you just think an experiment , but you do n't actually do it , you just think it through , " he told her . " But now I 'm beginning to wonder if the equations have anything at all to do with reality , real physical reality . " And after they had parked the car and were walking among the redwood trees , Amy told him , " I began as a painter and I still like painting , other people 's paintings , but for me - you 'll think I 'm crazy - for me paint is too soft and squishy , too abstract . What I like about mosaic tesserae , the little pieces , whether they 're glass or ceramic or beach pebbles or whatever , what I like is that I can hold the color in my hand . It 's a piece of color . It has shape and size and weight . I love that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it sounds crazy . " " It does n't sound crazy to me , " John said . What sounded crazy to John came later , after they had driven all over the place and it was getting late - Amy had to waitress at the Capri and John had to get to his dissertation - and they had arrived back at their stucco apartment house . " You remember the Schrodinger wave equations we talked about ? " said Amy . " Remember how we decided that by looking into those equations you could find out who the woman was that Schrdinger made love to and that she - " John interrupted , saying , " Not me . I mean , I could n't figure that out , could n't find out - " " She had a child nine months after that and Schrodinger was the father , " Amy continued . " That 's in the book ? In the biography ? " He was quite surprised . " No . But that 's what I think . I 'm sure of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out slowly and , he hoped , thoughtfully . He thanked Amy for brunch and told her he had had a good time , a really good time , and Amy said she had had a really good time too . " You said you were hoping I 'd drop by . Was it anything in particular ? " he asked . " No . I was just hoping you 'd drop by , that 's all . " Then Amy went off to work at the Capri and John went off to work on his equations . 7 John spent more and more of every day working on his equations , neglecting the rest of his life - sometimes even forgetting to eat , which had never happened before . On Friday he did n't remember to drive up to Heidi Egret 's until it was already the moment when he should have been walking into her studio . He telephoned her , knowing from experience how irritated she would be at his tardiness , and as her phone rang and rang he phrased and rephrased how he would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice on the answering machine said to leave a message . John announced that he was not driving up there , was going to spend the weekend on his equations , good-bye . As a matter of fact , he did spend the rest of Friday and all the next day on his thesis , but late on Saturday he phoned Amy and asked did she want to have breakfast or brunch on Sunday . " Of course I do . Knock on my door tomorrow morning and I 'll make pancakes , " she said . The next morning John took a long hot shower , sang while he toweled himself dry , stepped into the crisp white cotton trousers which he almost never wore , pulled on a sky blue shirt and trotted downstairs , carrying CDs of Bach , Miles Davis , Olivia Newton-John , Greek folk songs , and a big fresh pineapple , all of which he had bought right after phoning her . He knocked on Amy 's door . " Oh , wow , you look - " John began . Amy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and little blue trinkets dangled from her ears . She looked beautiful but also unfamiliar . " I like the way you look , " he said . " You 've begun a beard ! " she said , rubbing her palms against the stubble on his cheeks . " And I like it , " she added . " What beard ? " John had forgotten to shave for the past five days . As he told Amy while slicing up the pineapple , he had been working steadily and had been forgetting everything else . " I have n't spoken to anyone for a week , " he said . He made up for it by talking all through brunch , talking while he washed the dishes and Amy wiped , was talking when they got into his car and drove all over and he did n't fall silent until they stepped barefoot onto the beach at Half Moon Bay to watch the surfers . " I used to know somebody who surfed , " Amy said , looking away at the blurred horizon , squinting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and he 's rich . I met him at a gallery show last year . He drives a red Alfa Romeo . Maybe you saw it in our parking space . " John said no , he had n't seen it . " He got so drunk I did n't dare let him drive back to Berkeley . He fell asleep on the floor , " she said , turning to John . " I do n't see how you missed his car , a red Alfa Romeo . It was parked out back all night . " " Maybe I was away , " John said , looking off down the shoreline . " I used to go away on weekends . " They walked along the beach and swapped stories about everything under the sun . When the sky turned gray they got into his car and headed back home , arriving in Menlo Park as it began to rain . Amy said she had been rereading parts of Schrodinger : Life and Thought , especially the part where Schrdinger works out his equations on quantum mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those equations , " Amy said . " Because this other physicist , Werner Heisenberg , had already figured out how to solve those problems in quantum mechanics . Heisenberg had a way of arranging the numbers into boxes , an array , a big matrix , so that when you work the matrix you get the right answers . Then Schrodinger , our Erwin Schrdinger , created his wave equations and solved the same problems . Schrdinger used a more tactile approach . He was that kind of man , tactile . He called Heisenberg 's math repellent and ugly . Everybody calls Schrdinger 's equations beautiful . " " Well - " John began . " It 's true , is n't it ? " " The part about Heisenberg and Schrdinger and the equations is true , but about the woman - " They had turned the corner into the flooded parking area in back of the apartment house and come to a stop . The rain was beating on the car , streaming down the windshield . " Yes , she had Schrdinger 's baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daughter . And that daughter - " " Wow ! How did you arrive at that ? " She laughed . " I 've been doing what you might call a gedanken experiment . I 've just been thinking things through . " John had turned to Amy and now he put his hand tentatively , gently to her cheek , his fingers moving into her hair . " I 've been thinking too , " he told her hesitantly . " About other things . Us . " " Good . Schrdinger loved the things of this world , women especially , " Amy said . She was slightly flushed and her speech was beginning to race a bit . " He liked to see things and touch them , smell them , taste them . He was that kind of man . But there are a lot of other people like Heisenberg who do n't care about the physical side of things . They think the world is really , finally , when you get right down to it , an abstraction . " She turned her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Heisenberg thought the world could be reduced to a box full of numbers . In those days everybody was taking sides about this . " " I hope we 're on the same side , " he said , his hand moving beneath her arm . " God , yes , " she said , sliding her arm around his neck . " There was this other physicist , Max Born , who argued with Schrdinger , said the wave functions were only - Oh , God , " she said , speeding up . " Probabilities of what might be there , said you could never picture what was actually going on , " she finished in a rush . " I 'm going crazy , Amy . " " Me too . " The windows were getting foggy and it was cramped and uncomfortable in the car , so they dashed through the rain to the house . 8 Amy was right about Schrdinger 's equations and Heisenberg 's matrix . Schrdinger himself wrote a paper ( 1926 , Annalen dei Physik 79,73456 ) about the relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they produced the same results . But he believed theories should be visualizable ( Anschaulichkeit ) and he loathed Heisenberg 's quantum mechanics . In 1926 , a few days after Schrdinger had published his fourth and final paper on wave mechanics , Max Born published a paper asserting the statistical nature of Schrdinger 's waves - the waves , he said , were unimaginable clouds of probabilities . Of course , Schrdinger rejected that idea . For Erwin Schrdinger , everything he knew and loved was graspable in this world , our world of space and time , our living world , as he demonstrated during his years in Ireland . As for John 's thesis , it consisted of three papers on gravity , of which the first two were complete . In the third paper he had arrived at a bothersome equation or , as his dissertation director pointed out , many bothersome equations , and he was having a hard time figuring out what the equations implied . Unlike the European physicists of 1926 , John had not read much in the way of philosophy and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that it might , or might not , represent . Now all sorts of questions distracted and fascinated him , and though they were old questions to Schrdinger and Born , they were new to John Artopoulos . Indeed , these questions appeared to be at the opaque heart of his dissertation and they seemed unanswerable . To put it another way , in the previous six months he used up three reams of paper and had n't completed a single page . Of course , the past two weeks had been different because now his brain , his body , everything was on fire . 9 We do n't know the details of what they did , Erwin Schrdinger and the woman he was with , during winter of 1925-26 . The important thing is that he came out from that snow-covered chalet with his wave equations . And we should n't pry into what John and Amy did after they had dashed through the downpour and into her flat . John probably spent most of his waking hours on his equations , some of his time with Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague Gino . As for Amy , most likely she waitressed at the Capri and spent her free time on a new mosaic . What 's important is that on Sunday , April 18 , 2004 , Amy stepped out of a hot shower , wrapped herself in a towel and - Hey ! - there stood John in the open doorway , wisps of the steam cloud floating away to reveal a bottle of wine in one hand and two glasses in the other . " I finished it ! " he announced . " Wonderful ! Fantastic ! " said Amy . In the kitchen John set to work uncorking the bottle while Amy toweled her hair . Then they sat at the table and he poured a glass for her , a glass for himself . " Greek wine , " he told her , smiling . He was more unshaven than ever , his eyes puffy and red-rimmed from lack of sleep , but he was happy . " Greeks have been producing wine for thousands of years , " he said , lifting his glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling a little , touching her glass to his . They drank . They talked about this and that , trivial things like John 's having enough time now to get his car radio fixed . Actually , Amy was n't paying attention to the conversation because up to now she had been able to avoid thinking about where John might disappear to when he had finished his graduate studies . Now she was thinking about it . John asked her how her new mosaic was coming along . Amy said she 'd show him later . He said it felt good to be through being a student and that it would feel even better to go to a real job someplace . Amy felt her heart contract at the thought of his leaving . She hesitated a long moment . " Now what do you do ? " she asked him . " I take a shower . Like you , " he said , standing up , laughing . " A long , hot shower . " He pulled off his T-shirt and padded barefoot down the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching it , singing . By the time John returned to the kitchen Amy had pulled on her cutoffs and a frayed jersey that said XANADU , and was refilling their glasses . John lifted his glass to hers , saying , " Tell me about Schrdinger 's woman and show me your new mosaic . " " I 'll show you the mosaic , " Amy said , touching her glass to his . " What about the anonymous woman and her daughter and so on ? " " I 'm sorry I ever said anything , " Amy told him . She hurriedly drained her glass and nearly choked , then coughed . " Now you think I 'm crazy or silly or just strange . " She coughed again , wiped her eyes and looked at John hopelessly . " Tell me anyway , " he said . " Please . " " I calculated that Erwin 's woman gave birth to a baby girl on September 9,1926.1 figure that about twenty-five years later this daughter gave birth to a daughter , too , probably in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton-John is Max Horn 's granddaughter , also born in England . " " Olivia Newton-John , the singer ? She 's Max Born 's granddaughter ? " " I thought everybody knew that . " " Please go on , " said John . " That woman , the granddaughter , probably gave birth about twentyfive years later to a daughter , probably here in the United States , " she said , fearing that every word would drive him away . " In California ? " " In California , yes , " she said firmly . " Probably . " " And you are ? " Amy laughed . " Amy Bellacqua , daughter of Vincent and Catherine Bellacqua , who is the daughter of Cosima Ferraro from Morano , Italy , and no relation to Erwin Schrodinger . " " How would we know if we found Schrdinger 's great-granddaughter amid all these probabilities ? " " She 'd be twenty-eight years old and have the Schrdinger equation tattooed on her butt , " she said briskly . " Now let me show you the mosaic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John loved to linger in , the air full of green leaves and tendrils , the floor carpeted with trays of moss , uncurling ferns , pale celery-colored sprouts , the mosaic tables bearing potted plants , the pots themselves composed of shards from broken mosaics , the walls blazing with mosaic designs . " Here , " she said , handing him a tray-like tablet where a dark background had imbedded in it a formula in white stones , like chalk on a blackboard . It was one of Schrdinger 's wave equations . " I copied it from Schrdinger : Life and Thought . I chose one I liked the shape of . As a kid I used to look at the symbols in my dad 's math books . I loved the sigmas , the deltas , the stately integration signs , " she told him . John gazed at the equation , murmuring " Yes , " and " Yes , " and " Yes , " all the while frowning . " But this first big symbol , " he said at last . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Amy . " What 's wrong with it ? " " You 've made it look like - it looks like - " " Like a pitchfork , or a trident like the old man of the sea carries . It 's psi , but I made the tail a bit longer . It 's more elegant , " she said . " What are the chances that Schrdinger 's unknown great-granddaughter has it tattooed on her shoulder ? " he asked . 10 The third part of John 's dissertation was published by the American Physical Society ( 2004 , Phys . Rev. Lett. 09,18 65-88 ) and was cited with sufficient frequency to be included in an online list of most important papers . Amy 's mosaics were exhibited by the Stern-Whitehall gallery in San Francisco , a show that was favorably reviewed in California Spectrum . Fred Marsh , hitherto unnamed , who drove the red Alfa Romeo sports car and who was already rich at thirty-five ( beach front property ) , was introduced to Heidi Egret at a gallery reception in Berkeley and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tattoo on Heidi 's shoulder did - and still does - look like the Greek letter psi , ? , the symbol for the wave function in Schrdinger 's equations . The tattoo also looks like a pitchfork and like Poseidon 's trident because , in fact , they all look alike . So much for the tattoo . As for Heidi 's great-grandmother and whether she was the woman who spent fifteen or twenty days with Schrdinger in that snow-covered chalet , that 's far less clear . It 's as if nature had rigged the game so that the more precisely we get to know one part , the tattoo , the less certain we will be about the other , the great-grandmother . Indeed , in 1927 Heisenberg published a paper ( Zeitschrift fur Physik 43 172-198 ) neatly defining this problem which has since become known as Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle . We know all we need to know about the tattoo . " It means I 'm a follower of Neptune , you know , the sea god , " Heidi explained . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Santa Cruz , places like that . " They were sitting in a caf in Berkeley - Heidi and Fred and John and Amy . It was a clear sunny day and the view over the Bay was spectacular . " Does your mother have a tattoo like that ? " John asked her . " I do n't remember any , " Heidi said . Her mother had died when Heidi was eight . Heidi 's father later remarried but was killed in a foggy car crash on California Route 101 when Heidi was fourteen . She was brought up by her stepmother , with whom she became quite close , but when Heidi was seventeen her stepmother married again and Heidi ran off to a life on the beach , surfing . That 's when she got the tattoo . " In Santa Clara , " she added . " I learn something new about her every day , " Fred said , smiling . He was wearing a silk jersey and a large expensive wristwatch and had his arm on the back of her chair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Amy . " That 's all ? " " And a good luck charm/ " Heidi told her . " It was engraved on a silver pendant that my grandmother gave me , my mother 's mother , but I lost it . " " It wo n't get lost now , " Fred said , patting her shoulder . The grandmother had come from Ireland to spend a year with Heidi and her father right after Heidi 's mother died . " And before she went back she gave me the pendant , her mother 's , I think , " Heidi said . " She 's buried someplace in Ireland . I do n't know where . " Amy Bellacqua and John Artopoulos married on September 18,2004 . Amy has been able to cut down on her waitressing and now works almost full time on her mosaics , and John works as a post-doc .
