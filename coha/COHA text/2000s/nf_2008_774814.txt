Author ? s Note // On the canted ceiling above my desk is a map of the brain . It // shows the frontal lobe and temporal lobe and parietal lobe and occipital // lobe as if they were places to visit-Rome , Milan , Trieste , // San Remo . The map , of course , is dumb . It says nothing about what // goes on in those places : that deep in the middle of the temporal // lobe , which itself is deep in the middle of the brain , there is a tiny , // cashew-shaped region called the hippocampus that is essential to // forming new memories , or that the prefrontal cortex , which sits behind // the eyebrows , is vital to foresight and being polite and paying // attention , or that the occipital lobe , which brings up the rear of the // brain , is central to sight itself . // I look at that map sometimes and think about how it is my own // brain apprehending it , and that to do so , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring its independence from my brain , begins to // wander among the events of the day , past and future , and plans for // summer vacation , and concern for a friend who is sick and the dog // in the yard , but never getting so far afield that it doesn ? t heed its // own call back . // Near the map , tacked to the wall , is a picture of the brain that is // doing all of that and all of this-this writing , thinking , typing , // seeing-my brain , in bright colors , which was taken a few years ago // in California . When I look at that picture I am not only seeing it , // but recalling that day , or aspects of it , so much has gone out with // the tide . I took notes on that trip , and carried a digital recorder , and // have read and reread those notes over the years , and listened to the // conversations , so I remember that day better than most , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even so it is fuzzy . I // can not say , for instance , what kind of rental car I drove , or what // book I was reading later that afternoon when I went to the beach , // or which beach , specifically , it was . // We rely on memory not only to remember , but to walk and dream // and talk and smell and plan and fear and love and think and learn // and more and more and more . Memory is how we know the world- // that is a tree , this is a sentence-and know ourselves-I like chocolate // ice cream , I am a singer-and know ourselves in the world . Amnesiacs // make the case well : it is not , simply , that they don ? t remember // their name or where they live , it is that absent memory , they are // strangers to themselves . The English philosopher John Locke believed // that we came into the world with our mind a blank slate , a // " tabula rasa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s a perfect // metaphor ( even if it ? s not exactly true ) , because it works to describe // what it ? s like to gain knowledge , and what it ? s like to lose your mind . // Stroke by uneven stroke , the eraser plies the board . // My father , before he died at the age of seventy-seven , had begun // to know this intimately , though never to the extent that the board // was wiped so clean that he approached Locke ? s natal state . He // knew , and he talked about it-about how frustrating it was to read // the newspaper and then have to read it again , or to stare at a can // opener , not knowing what it was for , or to pick up the phone to call // a friend , whose funeral he ? d attended two years earlier . // While it might have been natural for me to worry that my father ? s // fate someday would be my own , I didn ? t , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Alzheimer ? s disease , and since Alzheimer ? s disease // tends to run in families , I figured I was safe . This was not one of // those calculate-your-odds kind of conclusions . It wasn ? t a calculation // at all . At best it was a passing thought . Call it denial , call it repression , // or maybe arrogance , I just figured that if he didn ? t have // AD , what was it to me ? // But later , after he was gone , and all that was left were my memories , // some photos , and the key-chain recorder my mother made // him carry like a pair of military dog tags at the end in case he got // lost , into which he spoke his name , his phone number , and his // street address in the flattest of voices , I began to wonder . What if // the doctor had been wrong ? Almost everyone I knew had a parent // or an in-law or a favorite aunt or a colleague or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of a friend who had Alzheimer ? s , // as if the standard six degrees of separation had been universally // abridged to one or two . But another question bothered me more : // what if the doctor had been right ? What I mean is : what if my father // hadn ? t been sick ? // This was not a wishful fantasy about what my father ? s last years // would have been like if , when going to the basement to sort the recycling , // he didn ? t lose track of which items went in which bin and // stood there , paralyzed by confusion , for half an hour , or if he hadn ? t // thought he ? d filed his income tax when he hadn ? t . He knew who his // children were . He remained interested in politics . He had never // needed to activate the key-chain recorder . The question , rather , // was a kind of private , one-person , one-vote referendum on sickness // and health : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? // Since it is the nature of questions to beget more questions before // they yield answers , I soon stopped thinking about my father , // specifically , or about myself , even when I wondered why , for instance , // the memory of a forty-four-year-old was generally better // than the memory of a seventy-seven-year-old ( or was it ? ) , and why // the memory of a twenty-six-year-old was better than both . The answer // to this was not as obvious as it might appear . If age were the // culprit , what , precisely , was it stealing ? // In the popular literature I kept coming across references to the // brain that made it sound like a muscle . " Use it or lose it " was the standard // dogma . I read countless self-help books that promised to help // their readers " use it , " and compiled a stack of newspaper articles // that touted crossword puzzles and sudokus as the mental equivalents // of jogging and strength-training , and the more of these I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me : I understood that these activities // were supposed to be good for you because , apparently , they // built mental muscle , but why was that ? Was there a physiological // response to crossword puzzles , something that happened to the body // by doing them , and just whom did they help ? Anyone of any age ? // People with mild memory problems ? The worried well ? People who // were sick ? And if they were beneficial for people who were sick as // well as people who were not , was that because the same thing was // going wrong in the healthy brains that had already gone awry in // pathological ones ? // The questions piled up in my notebook , a sign , perhaps , that I // was using my brain , but to what end ? Books evolve idiosyncratically , // their single law of natural selection being , it seems , that they // choose you . I began calling up neuroscientists and spending time // with doctors and sometimes their patients . They were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota , Massachusetts , Chicago , // Los Angeles , and Irvine . They were in England and the Dominican // Republic and Canada and Italy and Iceland . To friends or acquaintances // who , upon hearing what I was doing , told me their particular // memory complaint or expressed a more generalized worry , I could // tell them how many smart and committed people were out there // looking for genes and molecules , developing drugs and vaccines , // searching out cures and therapies in plants and minerals already at // hand . These bench scientists and clinicians were making headway . // Moore ? s law-the one about the speed of microprocessors doubling // every eighteen months-didn ? t quite apply , but there was progress // being made and I was seeing it . ( I was also seeing rogues and patent // medicine salesmen , but doesn ? t every court have its jesters ? ) // The other thing I kept running into was lots of exclamations . A // week couldn ? t go by , it seemed , without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a breakthrough gene mutation , a // breakthrough cognitive therapy , a breakthrough food , a breakthrough // herb-so many breakthroughs that it seemed as though whatever // wall there had been between us and the dark should have come // down already , letting us bask in the sunshine of the eternal mind // cure . But hey , not so fast . // Before a drug can come to market , before a therapy can be designed , // and ( more often than not ) before a body can be healed , you // have to know where the problem lies . In medicine that knowledge // is often found at the cellular or molecular or genetic level , somewhere // in the mix of proteins of which we are made . To get through // the hyperbole and hype and promises and platitudes that now attend // to most public discussions about memory ( which almost always , // these days , seem to be about memory impairment ) , I had to // find out what the molecular biologists and cell biologists and biochemists // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // suites and chemistry labs and mice nurseries and hospitals // and pharmaceutical companies , and attending scientific meetings , // and reading research papers with unintelligible titles . Because there // are now many ways to look at the brain , I also made sure mine was // examined using each of them , in honor of one of the first scientists // of memory , Hermann Ebbinghaus , who made it a point to experiment // upon himself . Still , as a neuroscientist at Yale pointed out to // me , " you can ? t tell much from an N of 1 . " // In our own lives , by definition , we are always N s of 1 , which is // one reason why the prospect of getting sick can be so scary , and why // being sick is scarier still , especially if either of those conditions // entails the loss of self . ( Can there be an N of -1 ? ) If we ? re lucky , // of course , our N s connect-directly , contiguously , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also // how , in science , evidence mounts and findings are made and then // confirmed . // In the years that I was writing this book , crucial findings about // memory loss and Alzheimer ? s and normal memory and medicines // and cognitive therapy were made and confirmed , and even where // they were not , the ball was pushed farther up the pitch . From my // seat the view has been outstanding , and from what I have seen // there are many reasons to cheer . // Ripton , Vermont // November 2007 //
