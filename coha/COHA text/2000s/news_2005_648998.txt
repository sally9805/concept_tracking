<p> Ryan Williams 's alarm clock blasted him into the new reality of St. John 's basketball at 4:15 a.m. for two straight weeks in late September . He would drag himself out of bed in his home in Bayside , Queens , for the " boot camp " conditioning sessions that first began to bond and define this St. John 's team . <p> St. John 's new coach , Norm Roberts , named the two-week camp CODE Red , for Commitment , Ownership , Discipline and Execution . <p> For the Red Storm , which was riddled with problems on and off the court last season , the early-morning sessions were the signal of a new era . While its 8-12 record will not rekindle memories of the program 's halcyon days , there has been a distinct first step taken in St. John 's rebuilding project . <p> Roberts has worked to instill discipline on and off the court , has lured a top-flight recruiting class for next season and will get a boost from some much-needed upgrades of the university 's basketball facilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State and Virginia Tech , and its competitive play in nearly all of its losses indicates a slow awakening of the program . <p> " When we hired him the administration had high expectations and he 's exceeding them , " St. John 's president , the Rev. Donald J. Harrington , said of Roberts . " He 's doing better than I thought he could . I 'm very very pleased with what I see . " <p> Much of the progress has come through the strict discipline Roberts has instilled , players said . The senior forward Phil Missere recalled an October practice when Roberts kept blowing the whistle and yelling , " On the line , " to do a set of sprints . <p> If a player did not set on a screen , " On the line . " <p> If a player did not block out properly , " On the line . " <p> If a player did not rebound with two hands , " On the line . " <p> Missere estimated that the team ran 75 to 100 sprints that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , which Roberts called " attention-to-detail day , " underscored the new direction of St. John 's . With a small margin for error , the Red Storm could not afford even the most innocuous mistakes . <p> " We 're putting in a foundation of competing every day , putting in the hard work and being unselfish , " Roberts said . " Everyone has to do it . It 's not one person , it 's the team . " <p> Despite occasionally sore legs , the players say they have embraced Roberts 's mantras of discipline and hard work . <p> Last year at this time , the team and the university were reeling after a group of players visited a strip club after a loss at Pittsburgh . Several players who went to the club were accused of raping a woman in the team hotel . <p> The charges were later dropped because one of the players , using a cellphone , taped the woman 's threats to claim she was raped . But the incident , for which Harrington blamed the culture surrounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. John 's basketball . <p> " That right there was the low point , " said Williams , a 6-foot-5 junior forward . " It was a real big circus around here . " <p> That incident overshadowed the firing of Coach Mike Jarvis in December , the team 's 6-21 record and an investigation by the National Collegiate Athletic Association into allegations made by a former player , Abe Keita , that a former member of the basketball staff had paid him nearly $300 a month . ( The N.C.A.A. ruling is due this spring , but the university has already imposed a one-year postseason ban and one scholarship loss for each of the next two years . ) <p> In the wake of all that entered Roberts , a Queens native and the former Queens College coach , who earned his reputation as Bill Self 's recruiter at Oral Roberts , Tulsa , Illinois and Kansas . Roberts recruited or helped recruit the core of the current Illinois team , which is ranked No. 1 and is the only undefeated Division I team . <p> But before Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed to do some recruiting close to home . Roberts has built relationships with key A.A.U. coaches and rebuilt inroads in New York City high schools . He has also tried to strengthen the bond between the campus and the program . <p> Roberts has talked to his players about how they dress , letting women off elevators first and holding doors for people around campus . <p> " This is a combination of on and off the court , " Harrington said . " When I watch the men 's basketball team now , I see them as being truly representative of our St. John 's students . " <p> Roberts and his staff have done little things to try to win back the students on campus . <p> Members of the basketball staff took two-hour shifts to help move freshmen into their dormitories when they arrived last summer . During common hour , when students break for lunch , the basketball staff stops by dining halls and campus thoroughfares to mingle with students . And Roberts has sent mass voice mails to students thanking them after home games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , down more than 1,000 a game from last season . <p> " We 've still got a long way to go , " Roberts said . " New York City is a place of wait and see . Now we need to be consistent and keep it going . " <p> As for the on-court product , Roberts has received compliments from on campus and beyond . <p> From his office just up the hill from the arena named after him , the former coach Lou Carnesecca says he likes what he sees . Carnesecca said he appreciated Roberts 's stress on defense , an offense with structure that still allows players freedom and a solid foundation for the future . <p> " When we get numbers , you 're going to have to beat him , " Carnesecca said . " He 's not going to beat himself . That 's very important . " <p> St. John 's has played with a rotation of seven scholarship players and Missere , a former walk-on . That has not gone unnoticed around the Big East . Before St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled Roberts aside and complimented him on the passion his team played with and the team 's turnaround . <p> Brey said the Red Storm had completed the first step in rebuilding by being competitive in the Big East , although it is only 2-8 . <p> St. John 's had generally been able to replenish its roster by recruiting well , Brey said in a telephone interview . " That place can come back quick , as we 're seeing already , " he said . <p> The foundation appears solid . Roberts has four players signed for next season , and all should contribute immediately . <p> The class is highlighted by Anthony Mason Jr. , a 6-foot-6 swingman who is the son of the former N.B.A. player Anthony Mason , and Ricky Torres , a 6-4 wing from St. Raymond 's High School in the Bronx . Aiding the interior will be Aaron Spears , a 6-9 junior college forward whom Roberts recruited to Illinois , Spears 's first college stop , and Tomas Jasiulionis , a 6-10 player from Lithuania who can play inside and out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daryll Hill ( 19.7 points a game ) and Lamont Hamilton ( 13.7 ) , both sophomores . Next summer , St. John 's new on-campus practice facility will be complete , and the Red Storm will have two experienced stars and a sturdy group of complementary players . <p> When asked if he thinks a few years ahead , Roberts paused and smiled . <p> " I do , " he said . " I think about that all the time . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com The senior forward Phil Missere said the entire team ran sprints when any player erred . ( Photographs by G.
