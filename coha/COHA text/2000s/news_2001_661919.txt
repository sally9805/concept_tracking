Undocumented asylum seekers - some fleeing clan violence in Somalia , rape in Kosovo , or forced sterilization in China - are sent to urban detention centers and rural county jails when they arrive in America . <p> Held without bail , they are virtually without rights under U.S. law because they do n't have valid passports or visas . <p> Mohamed Jama Abdille has been among them . He grew up an orphan in Somalia , and the mystery of his parentage made him suspect in the east African nation where alliances are built on clan heritage . Although a judge found his tale of torture and repeated arrest true , Abdille was jailed in the United States for 21 months . <p> Karyna Sanchez said she fled her ex-husband 's death threats after their political differences spiraled out of control in Ecuador . When the Immigration and Naturalization Service put her in a New York detention center , the young mother handed her 3-year-old daughter over to friends . <p> According to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights , she saw her daughter only twice during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanchez dropped her asylum claim after losing the first round . Last year , mother and daughter were deported . <p> Patrick Mkhizi grew up in Zaire , the son of an opponent to then-President Mobutu Sese Seko . He came to America aboard a Greek freighter after being beaten and imprisoned by soldiers he says attacked his family on Oct. 7 , 1996 . <p> Mkhizi won asylum after more than three years in INS custody , some of it spent in isolation . When he won his case last November , guards at a York , Pa. , jail awoke him in the middle of the night without explanation , drove him 171 miles to the INS facility in Elizabeth , N.J. and set him free with $2.03 , according to INS records . <p> Beginning this month , the INS will phase in new standards giving inmates better access to attorneys and legal materials , but the rules do n't guarantee legal representation or other rights Americans take for granted . <p> Asylum approvals by the INS rose from 2,908 in 1991 to 18,556 in 1996 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seekers to be well-intentioned . The United States gave them working papers and let them begin building lives while immigration courts processed the paperwork . <p> But by the mid-1990s , such cases buried the INS . More and more people seemed to call themselves refugees just to get the green card that came with an asylum application . Some took jobs and disappeared into the population , skipping their asylum hearings . <p> Then Congress rewrote immigration law to secure the nation 's borders , reduce the flow of illegal drugs , and protect American jobs . <p> Since 1997 , everyone whose passport or visa is n't in order when they arrive has been deported or incarcerated . The fight for asylum can be long : 35 days on average , but years in some cases . <p> Getting tough seems to have made an impact : the number of asylum seekers dropped from 155,868 in 1996 to 124,777 in 1998 . <p> Although there are no firm numbers available on fraudulent asylum claims filed before 1997 , INS spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar says the new law did what Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to litigate . <p> Because they lack valid passports , the identities of asylum seekers is usually in question , INS officials said . Some could be criminals or terrorists , making them a potential threat to the United States . <p> Detaining undocumented aliens has given INS time to investigate claims before claimants can melt into the population . <p> Pierre Ditunga Mulamba arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York last April , telling authorities he had been beaten , starved and shocked with electricity for his political activism in the Democratic Republic of Congo . He escaped by using a tourist visa in someone else 's name . <p> " It was the only way for me to travel . If I got to the United States , I could tell them the reason I left , " he said in a recent interview . <p> When he arrived , Mulamba was detained . <p> The INS has about 20,000 people locked up on any given day . Most are criminals waiting to be deported , but about 3,000 a year are asylum seekers like Mulamba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their race , religion , nationality , social group , or politics . <p> Mulamba requested asylum after debarking the plane , and authorities eventually found his story true . But INS agents at the border do n't have the power to judge a case 's merit . The brought him to the Wackenhut Correctional Facility in Queens , where he was given an orange prison jumpsuit and confined to a windowless dormitory with other detainees who ate , slept , and showered under guard . A chain-link barrier obscured the sky over the center 's courtyard - the only place inmates are allowed outside . <p> " I did n't have any idea about detention , " Mulamba said . " When I got there , I was shocked because it was jail . " <p> Eleanor Acer , senior asylum coordinator for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights , believes detaining undocumented asylum seekers is unfair , especially in a country " founded on the refugee tradition . " <p> She worries most about legal representation for those in INS custody , in part because a Georgetown University study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times as likely to win their cases as those without . <p> Applicants need expert witnesses to testify , a doctor to confirm past tortures , and documents from overseas to back up their stories . It can take two months or more for a lawyer to prepare a case . <p> But refugees are not assigned taxpayer-funded lawyers the way criminal defendants are . It 's up to the defendant to pay or find someone to help for free . And many are indigent , Acer said . <p> Asylum seekers are not allowed to speak to a lawyer or immigration judge until after they have met with at least two INS agents . Under the law enacted in 1996 , they must first pass through a preliminary INS inspection , then explain their fear of returning home to a second agent . Remaining silent means being deported under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act . <p> Later , during a more lengthy INS interview , detainees are allowed an attorney to help explain the process , but the rules do n't allow the lawyers to make closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This really adds to their trauma , " said Panos Moumtzis , a spokesman for the United Nations High Commission on Refugees . " Just the sound of the cells and the prison guards , for some of them it 's exactly what they have gone through back home . " <p> Some immigration officials say detention keeps immigrants safe and relatively comfortable while the Executive Office for Immigration Review decides a case . <p> " If you are deserving of asylum , we think you should get it as quickly as possible , " said John O'Malley , the INS assistant commissioner for deportation and detention . " And it does happen relatively quickly in the detention centers . " <p> Long-term detainees , he said , are usually held because they have already been denied asylum and are appealing , or because of difficulty obtaining travel papers from their home countries . <p> Still , INS is considering alternatives to detention . A pilot study by the Vera Institute of Justice found 84 percent of asylum seekers did show up in court when they were reminded of hearings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost was 55 percent less than detention , the study said . <p> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D-Mass. , has introduced a bill to end mandatory detention for asylum seekers who are not considered a flight risk or danger . The legislation would also allow the courts to order INS to parole certain detainees . <p> However , Daniel Stein , executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , says the United States can not afford to maintain more open asylum policies of the past , in part because terrorism is a threat . <p> He says the most cost-effective way to handle refugees is to sponsor camps near their home countries , not bring them to the United States . And when they do make it here , he believes temporary detention is a small price to pay for a lifetime in America . <p> " Asylum law ca n't protect everybody from the vexation and difficulties of living life in countries where politics and life is unstable , " Stein said . " It 's not fair to be admitting people who happen to get here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in New York , believes the cost of detention - at least $40 million a year - is too high . He also worries about detainees ' health . <p> In one instance , Lipner said a man who tested negative for tuberculosis when the INS took him into custody had to be retested upon release . He had been exposed to TB at Wackenhut . <p> Depression and anxiety may also be common . In a letter titled " Only the Corpse Knows the Torment of the Grave , " Abdille , the Somali immigrant jailed in Kennesaw , Ga. , wrote from his cell that he had " fallen into the hands of merciless people . " <p> In broken English , he compared jail to a cemetery , his fellow inmates to the dead . The letter included a drawing of a man in shackles being pulled to the ground . The caption reads : " Behind bars 540 days and calling for help . " <p> A judge ordered the INS not to send Abdille back to Somalia , so the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived for a year before coming to the United States . There , too , he was beaten , but immigration officials believe those attacks were random and do n't justify asylum . <p> The INS freed Abdille last week pending resolution of his case . No explanation was given for the decision . <p> Dr. Allen Keller , director of the Bellevue/New York University Program for Survivors of Torture , said many refugees are traumatized , and detention can worsen their symptoms . He said nightmares and trouble sleeping are common among those he has treated . <p> According to the INS , all detainees held for more than 72 hours have access to psychiatric care . If detainees refuse meals , or cry often , a doctor or nurse may ask if they need help . <p> " They do have compassion , " said Gene Migliaccio , who heads immigration health services . " What we tell our folks is we really add dignity to this process of detention . " <p> But organizations that represent detainees said mental health services have been offered only to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffer from general depression or anxiety . <p> " Forget it , " said John Plummer , a spokesman for Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society . " They do n't really see that as a problem . " <p> INS hearings are often closed to the public . Records are sealed to protect individual privacy , partly because many asylum seekers have endured humiliating torture or sexual abuse . Others fear retribution against their families back home , so journalists are n't allowed to see records without an individual 's permission . <p> In contrast to criminal cases in which the accused has the Sixth Amendment right to be informed of the " nature and cause of the accusation " against him , several Iraqi immigrants have been detained on the basis of secret evidence . In a California case - that of brothers Ali Mohammed Karim and Mohammed Mohammed Karim - the information was eventually declassified . Afterward , Judge D.D . Sitgraves called the government 's case " weak at best . " <p> " It is apparent to this court , " she wrote , " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Sitgraves granted the men asylum in June . <p> On the Net : <p> Immigration and Naturalization Service : http : //www.ins.gov <p> Report on the Implementation of Expedited Removal : http : //www.uchastings.edu/ers <p> End Advance for Sunday , Jan. 21 <p>
