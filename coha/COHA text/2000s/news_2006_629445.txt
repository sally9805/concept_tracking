<p> SPEED kills . It 's an axiom that falconers have acknowledged since the Middle Ages . <p> And , of the hunting hawks , none can equal the flat-out velocity of the peregrine falcon . It is regarded as the fastest significant animal on the planet . Buzzing insects do n't count . <p> But only recently was the top-end performance of a diving peregrine scientifically documented . <p> Perfect peregrine " We used to think 180 , maybe 200 , but the recorded dive was 240 miles per hour , " said master falconer Jim Ince of Houston . " Ken Franklin , a falconer in California , clocked it electronically in a study supported by National Geographic . <p> " A few other falcons might have the capability but they do n't hunt the way the peregrine does ; it evolved with the perfect shape for speed . The wing feathers are hard and flat , and the toes are long and thin for raking a bird from the air . " <p> The peregrine is the most widespread of the raptors . It feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or height , when hunting . The exceptional altitude , as much as several thousand feet for a big female , provides the momentum for the vapor trail of the stooping peregrine . The dive on game was likened by the ancients to " an arrow driven from heaven . " <p> " Other big falcons like gyrfalcons and prairie falcons feed on small mammals as well as birds , " Ince said . " Because they 're ground feeders , they 're not as specialized and they do n't fly as high . They have shorter , thicker feet for grabbing rabbits . " <p> The long toes and talons of the peregrine are distinctive ; John James Audubon identified the peregrine as the " big-footed falcon . " <p> Royal choice <p> The bird has speed to burn but , more than that , it has class . The splendid carriage and quiet demeanor made it the favorite of medieval royalty as the falconry teachings of the Middle East and Far East followed the Crusades back to Europe . Other falcons fell short and lesser " pot hawks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peregrines are intelligent yet easily " manned " to accept proximity to people . Regardless of raptor , manning is perhaps the most amazing aspect of falconry . The predator flies free , yet , through trust , returns time and again from the wild . There is something significant , almost magical , about that bond . <p> Ince was drawn , even obsessed , from the start . <p> " I first got into falconry in junior high during the early ' 60s , " he said . " I knew that 's what I wanted to do and I 've stayed with it ever since . <p> " As luck would have it , the ' 60s were the low ebb for birds of prey . Pesticides and lack of regulations put a big drain on hawks - peregrines , especially . But now is a great time for raptors of all species . " <p> The Peregrine Fund breeding program at Cornell University offered a big leap forward , Ince said . <p> " Dr. Tom Cade headed it ; he was known as the Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like 10,000 peregrines between the mid-1970s and the late 1990s , " Ince said . <p> Separately , aplomado falcons have been reintroduced in Texas . Long-time falconer Granger Hunt of the Chihuahuan Desert Research Institute assembled the program in the state . <p> Tassel gentle ' Ince 's bird , Gaucho , is a male peregrine - a tiercel , or what William Shakespeare called a " tassel gentle . " The tiercel , or tassel , is so-named because the male is approximately one-third the size of the robust female . <p> " I 've had Gaucho seven years , " Ince said . " We 've taken small ducks like teal and scaup , plus snipe , dove , and quail during the falconry season . <p> " He 's a good , strong flier , but the tiercels usually do n't have as high a pitch as the falcons ( females are referred to as falcons ) . He weighs about 19 ounces ; that 's his normal weight . Some falconers like to take them down about 10 percent , but I like the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . His master status allows three , but even one is a major commitment . <p> Daily one-hour workouts during the hunting season , October through February , are what Ince is after . <p> " Weather does n't matter , " he said . " Wild hawks fly regardless . Heavy fog is the only thing I 'll avoid ; if you ca n't see the bird and it ca n't see you , it 's easy to lose . " <p> Fine metal bells attached to a hawk 's wrists are the traditional trappings for monitoring flight , but modern falconers often use radio telemetry . <p> A thin , inoffensive antenna is temporarily fixed on the leg , and a good rig might cost $600 or $800 . <p> But the bottom line of falconry remains the same in the electronic age : If the hawk wants to go , it 's gone . <p> No amount of modern technology or ancient cajoling can a recover a bird that gets the wind in its sails and " rakes away . " <p> Uncommon dedication The loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manning and maintaining . <p> Falconry is not for everyone . It demands uncommon dedication , far more than most casual observers are willing to invest . State and federal permits are required to possess hawks , and stiff regulations are implemented to discouraged the uncommitted . <p> " We issue only about eight or nine new falconry permits per year , " said Jennifer Blecha , wildlife permit specialist for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department . " There are probably between 100 and 150 practicing falconers in the state . Most are in the major urban areas - Dallas , Houston , San Antonio , and Austin . " <p> The Texas Hawking Association , founded in 1970 , has approximately 250 members ; the North American Falconers Association , founded in 1962 , has approximately 2,500 . Not all are practicing falconers . <p> California leads all states with approximately 800 falconers . <p> " When I started , there were no regulations , " Ince said . " It 's good that the formal training requirements are in place ; for example , the beginner qualifying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird . <p> " This weeds out what we call the credit-card falconers . You 've got to be passionate about it or it wo n't work . " <p> Passing the torch Ince regularly mentors beginners . One of his charges is Chuck Redding of Houston . <p> " I 've been fascinated with hawks since I was a kid in Illinois , " Redding said . " I met Ince in ' 02 but was n't ready to make the commitment . Then he agreed to sponsor me and I got the beginner 's permit in the fall of ' 04 . <p> " For the first two years as a beginner , you 're allowed to keep a kestrel ( sparrow hawk ) or a buteo like a red-tailed hawk ; I 've had a passage ( young ) redtail , Cisco , for about four months and he 's a great bird . <p> " I think I could have flown him free in two weeks . He hits the brush hard and in the last 12 trips he 's taken eight cottontail rabbits . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and hope to one day fly a peregrine . " <p> The sentiments are those of the rare few who look to the sky and stare in wonder at the thin scream of a living arrow . <p> In a world cluttered by cheap thrills and quick fixes , it is rare to see - much less share - perfection . <p> And that is the ancient and secret thrill of falconry . <p> WANT MORE ? <p> Suggested reading , and resources for more details : <p> Falconry books " American Kestrels in Modern Falconry " ; Matthew Mullenix . <p> " Art and Practice of Hawking " ; E.B.
