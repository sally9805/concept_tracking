I came to Mongolia to flyfish for Taimen , the legendary salmonlike fish that lives in its big rivers . When fly-fishing did n't work , I tried spinning with lures . When spinning with lures got no bites , I tried half a dead lenok ( another kind of fish ) . When the lenok was a bust , I went to the can't-miss bait : a prairie dog . And now , in the last hours of the last day , the dead prairie dog at the end of my line was mocking me . After five hours of continuous casts into the Delger River without so much as a nibble , the dog was both absurdly stiff and unbearably heavy , the twin effects of rigor mortis and being water-logged . And even though it had been dead for almost 24 hours , it somehow stuck its stiff , black tongue out at me . Sure , I 'm dead , it seemed to say , but you are one sorry-ass fisherman . You could n't catch a taimen if you were both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I may catch one yet . " I took another step downriver and cast once more into the water and started another retrieve . I was so far gone by this point that it did n't even strike me as strange that I was conversing with my bait . Because the dog had a point . I had traveled halfway around the world on the trip of a lifetime , fished my brains out for six days , and been skunked . The Journey From Moron Looking back , there were signslike the name of the Mongolian town from which I embarked on a six-day hunt for big taimen : Moron . But I was too pumped to be suspicious . After reading about taimen for years , I was finally going after one of the least known gamefish on earth . And after 48 hours on airplanes , I had finally made it to Mongolia , one of the most isolated and unspoiled countries on the planet . The fish that had prompted me to take leave of my senses is an evil-tempered , prehistoric critter that lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongolia and Siberia , most of which flow into the Arctic Ocean . Hucho hucho taimen is a spotted fish that grows to great size ( fish measuring more than 4 feet and 50 pounds are not uncommon ) . Because taimen ( pronounced TIE-men ) live in such remote areas , they are little studied , and sport fishing for them is a recent development . The current all-tackle record , a 92 - pounder caught in Siberia in 1993 , is likely nowhere near the maximum size . There is , for instance , a report of a 231-pound commercially caught fish back in 1943 . It is an ancient species , the ancestor of modern salmon and trout , equipped with an oversize mouth lined with rows of small , sharp teeth . And it is belligerence personified , cannibalizing its smaller brethren and happily murdering pike , salmon , grayling , small birds ... and prairie dogs . I 'd read online that Mongolian nomads hook a dog , float it downstream on a shingle of wood , and then give the string a quick jerk . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water before attacking its prey , stuns it with a blow from its powerful tail , and then comes back around to finish the job . The idea of catching a sociopathic aquatic vertebrate like that on a gentlemanly 9-weight fly rod appealed to me . It would be like putting on a top hat and tails and going 10 rounds with The Rock in a phone booth . I booked a trip with guide Andrew Parkinson through Waders On.com , a worldwide fishing resource based in the United States . And now I was bouncing over the Mongolian steppe in a van with him and three other anglers : Greg and Bruce ( two Aussies on a six-week fishing trip to Mongolia , Alaska , and the Kamchatka Peninsula ) , and Steven , a Canadian working in Beijing . Even in my jet lagdiminished state , I was struck by the landscape . But it was n't so much what was there as what was not . There were no signs , no fences , no concreteand just to keep things simple , no road . Only endless rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategically between Russia and China , is a huge place , three times the size of France with a population of just 2.75 million , of whom 43 percent are nomadic . Herds of sheep , goats , shaggy yaks , and tough little horses dotted the land . We passed ancient piles of stones , the altars of invaders who had come and gone as long as 4,000 years ago . Prairie dogs and big marmots streaked for the safety of their dens as they caught sight of the van . Overhead flew ravens and rare white-naped cranes , which number just 5,000 worldwide . " Just hope Ganchuluun does n't see a wolf , " Parkinson said of our driver . " If a Mongolian in a car or on a horse sees a wolf , he goes a bit mad . And he wo n't stop until the car is broken , the horse ca n't run anymore , or the wolf is dead . Mongolians absolutely hate wolves . " We stopped to view deer stones , upright grave markers from the Bronze Age . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer antlers . On one Parkinson pointed out what he thought was a fishhook . Every few miles we came across gers , the traditional round , felt houses that nomadic herders have been picking up and moving every few months for centuries , forever in search of new grass . A LOG WITH FINS We finally got to camp , a series of gers along the banks of the Delger River , late that afternoon . Over dinner , Parkinson told us about the biggest taimen he 'd caught . He and a friend had been prospecting a new river when they spotted a log in the shallow water at the head of an island . Logs being scarce in Mongolia , they inspected this one more closely and determined that it had fins . The friend tried to reach it with his fly rod and failed . Parkinson had a spinning rod and cast a mouse lure in front of the fish . It made the classic taimen attack , leaping clear and clubbing the fish with its tail . Unfortunately , it snapped the 20-pound-test line in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the line held . He fought the fish for over an hour as it leapt and raced seven times up and down a side channel of the river . His shoulder and arm went numb during the fight , and his friend massaged them whenever the fish went down to sulk . At last they fought the fish into shallow water . Because it was too big for their net , they beached it . Parkinson 's friend was an experienced angler , but he 'd never tangled with a taimen , and Parkinson had to talk him into approaching . They measured it at 53 inches . It broke their handheld scales , which maxed out at 50 pounds . That was when Parkinson decided to chuck his job as a farming consultant back in England and move to Mongolia . Let the Games Begin The next day we started fishing . Taimen like big pools and long riffles , Parkinson told us , but since they could be picky , it was necessary to methodically cover every foot of water . We 'd be fishing big gurglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when popped . All of us piled into the back of an old Zil 31 , a six-wheeled army truck that Parkinson said had " fallen out of the back of a Russian army depot " about the time the Soviets pulled out of Mongolia around 1990 . We dropped the two Aussies and Edward , a friend of Parkinson 's who had come over from England to guide on the trip , downstream . Steven and I got off with Parkinson a couple of miles upstream . During the next eight hours , we experienced a sampling of Mongolian summer : 50-degree swings in temperature accompanied by sun , rain , snow , hail , and winds that rotated through all four points of the compass . The river was 100 to 150 yards across , but the current in most places was so strong that I found it impossible to wade past my knees . Even though the wind made for tough casting , I managed to work a long pool 30 feet out . The drill was to cast across , strip methodically , let the fly sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its drift , move a step downstream , and repeat . Steven and I did that for three hours without so much as a rise . Then it was time for lunch . When the truck rumbled up , Greg and Bruce were already in back , smiling . Each had landed and released a taimen . The bigger , Greg 's , had gone 30 inches . " Just amazing , mate , " he told me . " Hit it not 4 feet from me at the end of the retrieve and scared me to death . Vicious fish . Took me 15 minutes to land it , and 30 inches is a small one . " He reported the teeth to be sharp and numerous and was glad he 'd had Parkinson 's biteproof fish-handling glove to remove the fly . HOLD THE DOG At lunch in the ger where we took our meals , Parkinson and some of the English-speaking locals he hires gave us a lesson in ger etiquette . Upon entering through the ridiculously low door , you move to your left , clockwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You never step on the threshold , touch other people 's hats , or use a knife to cut in the direction of any other person . If you spill any beverage , it is customary to immediately shake the hand of the person nearest you . It is considered rude to pass directly in front of an older person , point your feet at the stove , or put water or garbage on a fire , which the Mongolians consider to be sacred . When approaching a traditional nomad 's ger , the correct greeting is " Nokhoi khor , " which literally means " hold the dog . " A dog in this country is expected to earn its keep , which involves biting the legs off any unknown human . Nyamaa , a beautiful woman who helped around camp and spoke some English , further informed us that women , especially those who are pregnant , do not eat fish . Fish are the only animal that makes no noise , and the fear is that a woman who eats them may give birth to a deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both caught and released small ( 25-inch ) taimen . " I do n't understand it , " Greg said happily over a cold can of Chingis beer . " I 'm the worst caster in the lot . I think it 's my lucky Filson hat . " I smiled . I wanted that hatI wanted anything that might help me nail a taimen . The morning of the second day I spent fishing some beautiful water , a bend in a small gorge with very fishy-looking pools . Nyamaa was walking some distance behind to keep an eye on me . The Delger , like most rivers in Mongolia , has few particularly dangerous rapids , but on the other hand , it 's big water , powerful in places , and cold . If you filled your waders , you could get into trouble a lot faster than you could get out . I had worked a long section and then walked back up to fish it again . Seated on a rock a little above me , Nyamaa watched in silence . As I passed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " So what did you do with all the fish ? " as if she 'd somehow spirited them away . At that instant , as my fly lay motionless at the end of its drift , a taimen hit the lure like a baseball bat and disappeared . Frantic , I cast repeatedly , trying to draw another strike . No dice . I looked at Nyamaa , who was smiling enigmatically . Her poise at that moment was unnerving , almost as though she had known the fish would pick that moment to strike . My intention all along had been to take the high road , flyfishing only . By the third day , however , I had begun to slide . I accepted Parkinson 's offer of a spinning rod and a large , articulated black-and-silver Rapala rigged with two single barbless hooks . This way I could cover more water and fully expected another baseball-bat strike at any moment . Wading out as deep as I dared toward a bend where a glacier came into the river on the far side , I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , another taimen came up and exploded . It did everything but actually bite the lure . Again , my efforts to raise a second strike failed . Taimen were aggressive but wary . Parkinson was as disappointed as I was , the sign of a good guide . " My aim is to show every angler a meter-long fish , " he said . " Usually , I can . We may have to resort to extreme measures . " He gave me a version of his mouse lure , which , when wet , weighed several ounces . I actually threw it over the river and landed it on the glacier , from which I teased it into the water . Still no luck . At lunch we found out that Greg had hit the jackpot , landing a taimen measuring just over 40 inches and so broad across the back that he could n't grab it . " I 've never seen a freshwater fish like it , " he said . While trying to free his lure , he had reached into the fish 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , " he said , " and bit through the bloody glove like it was paper . Lucky I only got this . " He showed a small puncture wound on his finger . I wanted a wound like that , too . LUCK WITH LENOK At lunch that day as we sat by the river eating sandwiches , Nyamaa urged me to have a beer . " It will make fish come . I am sure of it . " I had the beer . When I woke up , I was lying in the grass and everybody had headed off fishing . Nyamaa was watching me . " You were really asleep . We tried shaking you but you would not awaken . So we take your picture . Did you dream of a fish ? " I could n't remember . She still had that unnerving smile . I got my rod and started casting . In my obsessive hunt for taimen , I 'd been passing up all sorts of other opportunities , from fishing for lenok and grayling to visiting a local village and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way upriver and crossed in a spot so deep that the water came up over the floorboards in the back of the truck and it appeared that we might be stationing a casting platform there permanently . As I walked back to the rendezvous point , I discovered Bruce casting in a pool with a little 5-weight . He offered to let me have a try , and within 15 minutes I 'd landed two lenok and two grayling , good additions to the night 's dinner . It was also the first tug on my line I 'd felt since leaving home . I liked it . Lenok are quite good sport on a light rod , but I was a prisoner to my taimen-mania . Parkinson , sensing my fixation and my despair , cut the smaller lenok in half and rigged the tail end on his spinning rod with a treble hook . I 'd slipped from flyfishing to spinning with lures to heaving a bloody hunk of fish across the river . It was n't the first time I 'd thrown my dignity out of the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last . YOU SHOULDA BEEN HERE NEXT WEEK On the evening before my last day of fishing , I saw two of the camp boys on horseback trotting swiftly back to camp carrying something hanging from a string . As they got closer , I saw that it was a freshly snared prairie dog . My heart soared . I was so happy I nearly dropped my beer . Prairie dogs are cute little things , and were it not for the fact that they are known to carry bubonic plague and dig horse-crippling holes in the ground , I might have regretted this one 's demise . Parkinson and the boys spent about an hour working on the dog , fortifying its spine and rigging the treble hook until the lure swam with a lifelike motion . They put a good dollop of Gink on the tail to make it float realistically . This , I was sure , was going to be one of those trips that is saved at the last minute with the catching of a tremendous fish . Mine would be a tale told around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't turn out that way . I cast that damn prairie dog until we both looked about equally beat up . I never got a bite . As the evening grew gray and the wind came up , Parkinson came and put a hand on my shoulder . " We know there are fish here . And you fished harder than just about anybody I 've ever had on a trip . " I turned and tried to smile . The next day , we loaded up and left . The last image I saw of camp was Nyamaa and her benign , knowing smile . We said good-bye at the Moron airport as another group of anglers got off the plane we were about to board . I got an e-mail from Parkinson the next week . Fishing had turned fantastic right after we left . His four clients landed 18 taimen in five days . Each had one that measured at least a meter . I 'm trying to be philosophical about it . I find beer helps . Illustration <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
