Q Some time ago my boyfriend helped me act out one of my sexual fantasies-to have sex with two men . He set it up with his cousin ( who did n't know I was his girlfriend ) , and it was great . My boyfriend refuses to do any more threesomes-and I , too , am past that-but I want to see his cousin again . I think about him all the time ; he 's so much more tender than my man . His cousin told me he would n't mind seeing me either . What should I do ? A Wow , that was a pretty daring experiment . A menage a trois involving two men is n't an unusual wish-but not many act it out . You not only realized a fantasy , but you also learned some things . ( Sexologists say kinky sex can allow you to think more about your own desires and sexual needs . ) You experienced two men who were at different places in their own sexuality , one more affectionate and gentle than the other . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , you are now fascinated with the cousin . But do n't develop a secret liaison with him . That could turn volatile ; you do n't want to start a family feud . And responsible , consenting adults must be careful not to become bed-hoppers . To solve your dilemma , you have to be as boldly open in your communication as you were in your sexuality . Talk honestly with your boyfriend about the escapade . Share your insights-fears , doubts , hang-ups and shameful or triumphant feelings-about it . Be honest , and encourage him to be . Now that you know what you like , talk to your boyfriend about pleasing you that way . Be careful how you approach the subject , though . Some men define themselves through sex , and no one likes his bedroom skills being compared with someone else 's . If your man feels this way , try to protect his pride and his manhood . And if he is a good catch otherwise , work on developing a better sexual relationship with him .

When I moved near her last year . I found out that she 's a compulsive liar . She 'll say anything to make herself look better . She makes up so many stories that I do n't know when she 's telling the truth . I feel betrayed . I do n't want to sever the friendship , but I ca n't sit by and let someone lie to me . Should I confront her ? A good friend offers support . If your friend were suffering from cancer . you would n't hesitate to help her in her healing . Her compulsive lying is also a sickness . She is n't trying to deceive anyone deliberately , so do n't take it personally . And let go of your feelings of betrayal .

Compulsive lying may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , not telling the truth is a cover-up for unresolved pain . It may be dangerous for her if she does n't know the truth from the lie . Have a talk with your friend . Do n't confront her in anger or deride her for not being honest . It wo n't work . ( A compulsion ca n't be resolved by simply trying to persuade or order the person to renounce it . ) Instead , tell her how much you cherish the friendship and list all the good things about her . Say " I know you 're a kind , loving person-that 's what I love about you . Lying does n't fit into your personality . Why do n't you talk to a counselor who can help you sort this out ? I 'm with you all the way . " If she resists , do n't give up . Suggest that she talk to a minister or spiritual adviser .

In between the marriages , I dated several men who were bad for me . I want a healthy , loving relationship . What am I doing wrong ? Of course you want a loving relationship . If you 're like many sisters , you 're probably starting from the wrong vantage point . You 've got to love yourself first , darling . Self-love precedes all loving relationships . Other people do n't bring or take love away-they can only nourish the love that already exists inside you . People respond to what we 're advertising . Are you advertising a loving sense of self or a sense of desperation ? Were the men you dated " bad , " or did they just reflect your lack of a loving self-esteem ? I 'll wager that the reason you continuously select the same kind of man is that you are the same woman , which means you 're not learning the self  --  improvement lessons these men are bringing your way . Each of these men has come into your life to teach you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're showing you . Try this exercise : List the name of each man you have dated , and next to his name write down the major lesson you learned from your encounter with him ( for example , " John taught me that hanging on does n't make someone want to stay with me " ) . Write down as many lessons as you can , then compliment yourself for each one learned . Doing this should help you realize that wrong choices can be turned into the right thinking . I hope you 'll also discover that you do n't have to blame yourself for the failure of your relationships . Let go of the guilt because it will make you hang on to hurt and repeat mistakes . So tell yourself " No more guilt trips . " COTINUED ON PAGE 226 Look in the mirror and say " I feel better because I know faulty thinking does not make me a failure . I am still loving and lovable .
