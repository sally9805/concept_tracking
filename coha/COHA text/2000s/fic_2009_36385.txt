Discovering that Marky Larson had brought a gun along on the trip to Maine changed everything for Anthony Colapietro . <br> " Shut up , " snarled Marky . It was the hundredth time he 'd said it , or maybe the thousandth , since the two of them left New Jersey in Marky 's old dark blue Monte Carlo nine hours earlier . <br> " I did n't say anything , " Anthony protested . Not yet six in the morning , they 'd been on the road all night , and his eyes felt sore and gritty from lack of sleep . <br> " You do n't have to , " retorted Marky from behind the wheel . " I can hear you thinking . You think I do n't know what a punk like you is thinking ? Quit thinking , you punk . " <br> Marky believed , because he was a hardened twenty-four years old to Anthony 's wet-behind-the-ears twenty-one , that he could call Anthony a punk . <br> " Got your face stuck up to the freakin ' window , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gets a load of your face ? " <br> There were no cops around here . But there was also no sense trying to tell Marky that . Anthony had wondered how he got picked for this job , but now he figured someone must 've thought he could put up with Marky without blowing a gasket . <br> He stared at the water that appeared intermittently between the tall trees as the Monte rounded another curve in the narrow blacktop . The ocean was blue and glittery , flat as a plate ; as he watched , a big bird lifted from it with a slow rhythm of wings . <br> " I just never saw it before is all , " said Anthony . <br> Marky glanced over at him in contempt . " Never saw the ocean ? What 're you , a dope ? Lived a coupla miles from it all your life , you never freakin ' even been on the boardwalk ? " <br> Anthony shook his head . " Uh-uh . Ma would n't let me . " <br> Not as a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been in the juvie home six months already . From there , visiting the boardwalk was about as likely as visiting Mars . <br> Marky grimaced , showing small , even , white teeth . He was a good-looking guy with thick , curly black hair , a small , tightly constructed body , and what the girls called bedroom eyes . <br> Anthony did n't call them that , though , not even in his head . When he met Marky 's gaze , which he 'd already learned not to do very often , he got the strong , unmistakable sense that something unpleasant was in there , peering out at him . <br> Unpleasant and . . . different . Several times Anthony had looked over from the passenger seat at Marky and glimpsed something that chilled him . A lizard , maybe , cold-blooded and primitive , dressed in a Marky Larson suit . <br> But that must be just his imagination . Some jealousy too , maybe , because Marky was flash , Anthony had to admit . Thick gold chains hung over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen , probably , along with the fancy wristwatch . Crisp new blue jeans , new sneakers on his feet ; Air Jordans , it used to be , back when Anthony was helping boost them off of trucks , the drivers standing by knowing the score . <br> But that was years ago . Anthony 's own jacket was a Jersey Devils warm-up he 'd bought at a thrift shop for a few bucks , only because it was warm and cheap . He did n't even know what the in-demand sneaker was now . He 'd never read a map before , either , and it was this that had Marky so annoyed . <br> " I think we should turn here , " Anthony said as they came up on an intersection . <br> Well , not a real intersection like he was used to . More like a crossroads . Intersections had street signs . Stop lights . <br> And traffic . Other cars and people , neither of which were in evidence here on this empty , tree-lined road out in the middle of nowhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder there were no cops . " Well , should I or should n't I ? " Marky demanded . " I mean who the freak 've I got navigating for me , here , Chuckles the Clown ? " <br> " Turn , " Anthony said quickly . " Right . Or no , left . That 's right , left . " <br> Marky sighed heavily . " You 're a moron , you know that ? " But he took the turn . Despite his map-reading inexperience , somehow Anthony had managed so far not to steer them wrong . <br> It was n't the real ocean out there , either . According to the words printed on the blue area that represented water on the map , it was a bay . He sounded out the unfamiliar name in his head . Passamaquoddy Bay , it was called , and on the far side of it was Canada . <br> Anthony stared at the land , low and tree-covered , on the other side of the water , wondering if living over there felt any different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " They sure get up early around here , " he commented . Boats puttered offshore , cranelike contraptions jutting from the backs of them . Dragging something , though he could n't see exactly what . Nets made of chain , it looked like , and on the opposite shore he could just make out small houses . <br> Maybe the boat operators lived in the houses . Had wives and kids there , even . Anthony frowned . " It 's a whole other country , Canada . " <br> Testing the idea . Sounding it out . They 'd taught him to read , back in juvie . And they 'd taken his tonsils out , after they got infected . That was the sum total of what he 'd gotten out of the juvie experience . <br> Well , that and an early warning system , a kind of alarm that rang deep in his head when things were going haywire . It was jangling now very loudly and unnervingly like the bell for a fire drill , but there was nothing he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plucked a smoke from the pack in his T-shirt pocket , and punched the dashboard lighter with an angry stab . " Jeeze , " he said long-sufferingly . <br> The road here was even narrower than before , with great big trees crowded up on both sides . They made Anthony nervous , these huge green living things all around with no fences or anything to keep them in . <br> No paths , no park benches . He 'd have given his left nut for a coffee shop but he had n't seen one of those in a while , either . <br> Animals , though , he guessed . Bears , and . . . well , he did n't know what else might be running around in these trees . Were there lions in Maine forests ? <br> Marky might know , but another thing Anthony had figured out was that it was better not to ask Marky unnecessary questions . On the Tappan Zee , actually , when Anthony was first confronting the knotty problem of unfolding the map , he 'd realized it . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going so he could at least try to start plotting their route . That was the first time Marky had told Anthony to shut the freak up , adding that if Anthony gave him any crap whatsoever on this trip , Marky would shoot him and dump his dead body by the side of the road . <br> To emphasize this he 'd opened his leather jacket to reveal the gun 's checkered grip peeping from his inside breast pocket . <br> " Marky , the guy said not to bring any  --  " <br> " Screw the guy , " Marky had said viciously . " He wants to do the thing , let him do it his way . Hires me , I do it mine , okay ? " <br> Marky had already showed Anthony the small spiral notebook full of instructions for the job : Do this at this specific time , that at the other . Backup plans , too , for different things that might possibly go wrong . And . . . a photograph of a woman . <br> An old snapshot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . In it , the woman smiled into the camera : dark hair , full red lips , eyes laughing and bright . The snapshot had come out of the wallet of their employer , Marky had said , but he would n't say any more . <br> Probably because he did n't know , although just try getting Marky to admit anything like that . Finally there was the heavy cardboard box full of equipment that they 'd brought along , which naturally it had been Anthony 's job to load into the Monte 's trunk : two sets of night vision goggles , rubber-strap headsets to wear them with , a small recorder with an old-fashioned cassette tape in it , plus other things that Anthony could n't take the time to identify because Marky kept yelling at him to hurry . <br> What 's up with that stuff ? he 'd wondered , but now he just looked out the window again to where the underbrush crept up to and in places right out over the crumbling pavement . <br> No power poles , he noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished there were fences . <br> " This better be right , " Marky growled threateningly , spewing out a stream of smoke while casting another evil look at Anthony . " Or you 're in trouble . " <br> Anthony was pretty sure he was already in trouble . Coming up here with Marky had been a bad idea , and not only because of the gun . <br> The money was good , though . He decided his best course now would be to concentrate on the money . He rolled his window down to let some of Marky 's smoke out and got an unexpected faceful of ocean smell , cold salt water and what he guessed must be seaweed mingled with a hint of wood smoke . <br> The smell triggered a hard , deep I want feeling , like when a pretty girl walked by him wearing some really nice perfume . Went right on walking , usually , because girls like that would n't give Anthony Colapietro a second look . <br> Jesus , he thought , having given up yearning so long ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees again and a different smell came in , like the Pine-Sol from the juvie home . <br> Training school , they 'd called it . Yeah , training to be a loser . Every kid in there had grown up to be a knucklehead . The luckiest ones ended up running errands for actual tough guys . <br> Like me , he thought in a moment of bleak self-knowledge . An errand boy . <br> But since the unlucky ones were either dead or in prison , he decided that maybe this little field trip with Marky was n't so bad , after all . And the smell , he realized , was coming from the trees . <br> Pine trees , they must be , growing wild here right out of the dirt . He let this idea sink in some more , finding it worrisome but also strangely pleasant . <br> Marky spoke up again . " So I got ta do everything , " he snarled , " while you sit there playin ' freakin ' tourist ? What 're you , the Queen of freakin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted the map again hastily . Marky was right . He was n't keeping his mind on the job enough . A mean voice in his head added that this was why the losers were errand boys , that it was in fact why they remained losers . <br> The thought was so surprising , so different from anything he had ever come up with before , that he wondered for an instant if maybe it was n't coming from some other head . Marky 's , maybe . <br> But no . Marky was an errand boy , too . Just a meaner , more confident one . <br> An errand boy with a gun . " Okay , keep your shirt on . Turn here , " Anthony said . Hoping he was correct , that he had n't maybe started getting it wrong a hundred miles ago without knowing it . <br> Because Marky really would kill him . Even the " keep your shirt on " remark , lightly delivered and intended merely to mollify Marky , jolly him into a better mood , had triggered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body was only half dead when he shoved it out of the car . And Anthony had a feeling that if you got lost here , shot or otherwise , you might never get found again ; that the absence of paths , park benches , and cages for the animals was the least of it . <br> The very least of it . As he thought this , something moved way back there among the trees where sunlight angled in wavery golden patches surrounded by green gloom . Anthony tried to see what it was and especially if it was coming any closer . <br> But by that time they 'd already gone by , and when he craned his neck to look back , it was n't following them . Or if it was , it was hiding in the underbrush where Anthony could n't see . <br> " Hey , whoa , what the freak is this ? " Marky demanded as the pavement ended suddenly and the car began bouncing violently . <br> " End of the line , " Anthony replied . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , coupla minutes . " <br> The news seemed to cheer Marky . " Man , we are definitely not in Kansas anymore , " he said , his fingers wrapped tightly around the wheel , cigarette dangling from his lips . <br> Grinning , suddenly lighthearted . He snapped on the radio , a blare of country music filling the car . Marky sang along with the tune in a sarcastic falsetto , ridiculing the words and the down-home country twang , making stupid faces . <br> " Oh , she broke mah heart so ah broke her jaw , " Marky sang in his curiously high , nasal voice . " Ah cut ' er up with a big chain saw . " <br> Anthony was n't comforted by the sudden show of good humor , though , because that was another thing about Marky , that you could n't tell when he meant it : the grin , or the lizard look . As if to prove this , Marky snapped the radio off abruptly . <br> " Christ , " he exhaled in sudden disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They rode in silence a little more until , in half a mile or so , the dirt road got worse . <br> A lot worse . Loose stones clattered against the underside of Marky 's beat-up Monte as they jounced over the uneven track . The muffler banged a rock sticking up out of a pothole . <br> Bam ! Anthony looked back , wondering if the rock had torn the Monte 's muffler right off . Marky cursed eloquently , coming up with words and combinations that even Anthony had never heard of before , and his eyes grew cold and reptilian again as he glared over at Anthony accusingly . <br> Be there , Anthony thought at the house that was supposed to be hidden away around here somewhere , imagining Marky getting too frustrated and tired to be able to keep a lid on it . Shooting Anthony in the knee , maybe , just to let off steam . <br> He hoped it would be only the knee . But then around the next curve , a house did appear , first the roof and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches . <br> " About time , " Marky said grimly , as if it were Anthony 's fault that the trip had taken so long . They stopped in a graveled turnaround and got out into an enormous , waiting silence . <br> In juvie , the noise had been constant , like living against a background of heavy demolition . And afterward , the rooms in the boardinghouses he 'd lived in had been loud , too , right over the street in the kinds of neighborhoods where nightfall only got the quiet people to go indoors . Here , though : <br> Trees and more trees . Through them Anthony glimpsed the bay again , blue and glittering and . . . big . Much bigger than anything he was used to . The silence all around kept enlarging as well , as if it just might suck Anthony right up into it . <br> He 'd never felt so small , so at the mercy of something . Battling panic he waited for Marky to decide their next move , while his gut churned sourly and sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead : chukka-chukka-chukka ! <br> Anthony 's heart hammered and his mouth went dry . The smell of sun-warmed pine needles filled his head again , flooding into it like the ether they 'd used on him for his tonsils , clapping the mask harshly to his face . <br> If Marky killed him here , no one would find him . It would be like when he first disappeared into the juvie home , and then his mom died . <br> No one would know . No one would even ask . Pretty soon wild animals would come along hungrily and eat his body . His eyes , his ears . . . even the tongue he 'd used to cry out with , at the end . <br> Leaving only bones . <br> Continues ...
