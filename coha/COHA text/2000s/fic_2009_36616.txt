Let 's get something straight . Phil Camp had not set out to become a fraud , or , as it turned out , to prevent himself from perpetuating the fraud that he had become . That 's just what happened . <p> Huh ? <p> Man writes book to pay off ex-wife . Book is supposed to be a spoof . World takes book seriously . Man 's life changes . Man under whose name book was written , his life changes as well . Ex-wife paid off , but pissed . <p> A week shy of nine years and seven months ago , on August 10 , 1994 , Phil was standing at the bottom of Terminal A at Newark Airport , filling out a lost luggage form . He had been on the road for two weeks with the Mets , then Yankees , then Mets and , at thirty-six , was pretty sure he was about to become temporarily obsolete . After two years of inert negotiations between players and owners , Major League Baseball was seven days from its final drop-dead work stoppage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . As the shell-shocked maintenance worker who walked around the athletic fields at Phil 's college used to say , " No game . Go home . " <p> And if Phil 's financially bulimic employer , Excelsior Publications , had its way , stay home . For the last six months , Excelsior had been circling his desk , dropping subtlety-filleted reminders that he 'd better grab the **47;346;TOOLONG package the newspaper was offering before it was snapped up by someone with less of a past and more of a future . <p> Phil made it until the Tuesday after Labor Day before he took the buyout . But it had been the kind of coincidence-laden three weeks that happen to other people . Two days after he got home , he did ten minutes on some syndicated radio show called Bob and Tom and talked about everything other than baseball , prompting the kind of big , raucous laughs from the hosts they normally bestowed on C-list celebrities . The day after that , some guy who called himself a " book packager , " Wayne Beiliner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea for a funny book , call me . " The day after that , Continental called and asked if he 'd be interested in hearing about his baggage . " I know all about my baggage , " said Phil , " but I 'm interested in hearing about my luggage . " Ten yellow legal pad pages after that , he phoned Wayne Beiliner . " I think I may have something , " he said . <p> When Phil told Wayne Beiliner the title , Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? the book packager shrieked , " You just made five thousand dollars , pal ! " By the time Wayne Beiliner finished reading the ten pages of notes , Phil had made another five thousand dollars . <p> " How long will it take you to write fifty thousand words ? " <p> Phil 's head did the math . His one-thousand-word baseball stories took about an hour . Fifty hours . Forty-hour workweek , but no need to bust his ass .... <p> " Three weeks . " <p> " Take two months , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then get an illustrator . " <p> " You think you can sell this book in two months ? " <p> The book packager packaged a good laugh . " No , pal , " he said , " getting the illustrator takes two months . I 'll have this sold by Monday . " <p> That Tuesday , the ten-thousand-dollar check arrived by FedEx . It sublet Phil 's checking account for the five business days needed for clearing . In that time , he managed two phone calls to his exwife , the former Trish Lamphiere , then Trish Camp , now Trish Lamphiere , that were about as civil as the green room at Jerry Springer . The transcript from the first call still survives : trish : Hello ? <p> phil : Hi , Trish . It 's Phil . <p> trish : Yeah , what ? <p> phil : I got laid off at the paper . <p> trish : Great . <p> phil : But I have a proposition . <p> trish : Okay , let me sit down . Now , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm really just pulling up a chair . ( SFX : Click , followed by dial tone . ) <p> The second call went to completion . He offered Trish a one-time buyout of ten thousand dollars rather than pay the last twelve months of an alimony agreement . It turned out to be a savings of two grand for him . <p> " Fine , " she had supposedly said , " and sorry about hanging up . " <p> " No problem . " <p> " You 're the only one who makes me act like that . " <p> " Yeah , " said Phil . " I know . " <p> Their marriage had lasted three years , which apparently is as long as it takes to convince the average woman that you 're not kidding when you say you do n't want kids . Phil never imagined he would have to bother getting persuasive , because during their four-year courtship , he and Trish had often supped on the shared belief that families were other people 's migraine . <p> But somewhere in between dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth Panasonic breadmaker , all of that changed for Trish . Throughout the first two years of the marriage , whenever the subject would come up , Phil would say , " Please do n't ask me to have children , " as if he contained both sets of reproductive organs . Trish laughed , and figured him to be merely gun-shy , and mostly ironic . No otherwise kind man would deprive his wife of such joy , would he ? Especially one who often told and retold such vivid stories of his parents ' rearing of him and his older brother . Painfully hilarious tales of survival of the fits and starts , but mostly fits . And unexaggerated . The older brother , Jimmy , would stop rolling on the couch to weepingly corroborate every episode . Jimmy , who had two girls and a boy of his own and regretted none . So why not ? If Phil could recall and regale and laugh along , why not take a shot at a scarless version of upbringing ? <p> He could n't have meant it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me to have children and mean it ? But he did . <p> In the end , Year Three , when he was exhausted by the topic , Phil would quote lines from two then-recent movies : ( 1 ) " I do n't believe in childhood , " ( Nuts , 1987 ) , and ( 2 ) " My sister loved New York City because it had nothing to do with her childhood , " ( The Prince of Tides , 1991 ) , which would be followed by Trish saying , " It takes a real deep thinker to have Barbra Streisand as the principal architect of his philosophy , " and then SFX : Door slam . <p> Trish was hardly the average woman , clicks and door slams aside . Until her monumental misjudging of Phil 's feelings about raising a family , she had made one mistake in her previous forty-three years , an eight-month marriage when she was twenty . The only daughter of Patrick Lamphiere , the liquor store baron of Rumson , Fair Haven , and points south on the Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life but two bathed in the rarefied heir of someone well aware she is in charge and constantly being pursued . Others might have taken that splendidly dealt hand and wiped out the rest of the table on entitlement alone . But with Trish , the appreciation of her lot made her as magnanimous as she was attractive . The kind of magnanimity that comes with almost never losing . <p> Almost . Phil and Trish had one session with the couples counselor , who said the only way to resolve an impasse over children was to give in to the partner whose feelings are stronger . <p> " I 'll leave you over this , " she said . <p> And Phil Camp , whose carefree path had been well marked with signs that read give in here , got to hear himself say , " I 'll miss you , Trish . " <p> " Maybe we should pick this up next week , " the counselor had said when his jaw had finished its descent . It got a nice laugh from both of them . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became final in 1992 . The three-year , **27;395;TOOLONG alimony was a penance Phil wanted to live with . Resolved guilt . He more than understood that a woman does not get that time back , and a man is not allowed to say , " I ca n't have children " unless he 's broke and sterile . And as long as you are the son-in-law of Patrick Lamphiere , your wife will not be liquor-store barren . <p> Sad time . No winners . Phil would call his brother and say , " Everyone has their baggage , but this will always be my extra suitcase . " And so , he gave birth to his first baggage analogy . <p> Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? could have been called Around the World in 101 Metaphors . Luckily , that was n't the title , because the fad-buying public does n't care for **29;424;TOOLONG shopping . Phil Camp , who had always wanted to think of himself as an immensely complicated man , found that his pen-to-page concepts were quite simple . His prose was spare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was accessible . Come on . Who could n't read chapter 1 , " What 's My Baggage ? " or chapter 2 , " How Much Baggage Do I Need ? " and not relate to the point where they thought they had written the book ? <p> Under each chapter heading came the same subheadings : <p> Family <p> Marriage/Relationships <p> Workplace/School <p> Secrets/Lies <p> Archenemies ( Shit List ) <p> Potential Enemies ( Shit Waiting List ) <p> Apologies Due <p> Regrets <p> Expectations <p> Right Now <p> The rest of the Contents , laid out in bite-size twelve-page chapters , which borrowed less from the highbrow template of self-helpbooks and more from the browse-worthy tradition of a Sunday supplement , was equally unavoidable . <p> How Much Baggage Will I Claim ? <p> Does My Baggage Have the Proper Identification ? <p> What Baggage Will I Carry On ? <p> Can I Make My Baggage Fit Over My Head or Under My Seat ? <p> No ? Then What Can I Do Without ? <p> Lost Luggage <p> Matching Luggage <p> Anything Else to Declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal more than another dimension . It pushed the page total to 182 and justified the $18.95 cover price . Inked by the talented Jeff Hong ( think Bruce McCall before his fee went up ) , each drawing was realistically peopled by featureless souls with whom a reader could identify but not judge , and propelled by thankfully unsubtle comic imagery the same reader could take or leave , but usually took . <p> Phil took the entire three months to write Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? and half of that time was spent shaking his head and asking himself , " Are people going to get that I 'm just trying to be funny ? " It was a fair question , because some of the jokes were unmistakably jokes ( Of course , if you can make yourself feel better about your family by saying you were switched at birth , go with that ... ) , and some of the flip comments designed to fill a page ( Someone once defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line over and over again , expecting everyone would agree with him ... ) turned out to be accidentally profound . <p> The following December 1995 , Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? wedged itself into the bookstore checkout sightline of the solacestarved , stocking-stuffing consumer literati . The book 's publication date was as fortuitous as its placement . Two years after souls had gorged themselves on chicken soup , two years before the same souls would stop sweating the small stuff while wondering who moved their cheese . <p> " But it was supposed to be a goof ! " Phil said when he found out he would be collecting royalties a day after the book went on sale . <p> " Hey , what can I tell you ? " gushed Wayne Beiliner , who had moved from book packager to agent without touching the ground . " You 're a big , fat shining star . They ca n't get enough of Marty Fleck . " <p> Marty Fleck was listed as the author of Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? From the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . That name . Marty Fleck was the shortened version of Marty Fleckman , a less than unknown Houston golf pro who had led the 1967 U.S. Open after three rounds . It was the one joke Phil had kept for himself . During his years as a newspaperman , whenever he was having trouble getting in touch with an athlete , politician , or celebrity , Phil would pose as a publicist , Marty Fleck , and leave his number along with some vague message about a fifty-thousand-dollar personal appearance fee for " just showing up at some kid 's bar mitzvah on Long Island and waving out of the limousine window . " If whoever was taking the message pressed for more information , Phil would say , " Just have Darryl Strawberry ( Senator D'Amato , Glenn Close ) call me before three or I call my backup , Dwight Gooden ( Governor Cuomo , Kathleen Turner ) . Look , I got ta go . Salman Rushdie needs a suite upgrade . " Or something equally brio-saturated . It would crack up the newsroom or Trish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach would always call back . Always before three . <p> Marty Fleck was playful in a way Phil Camp never was , and mercifully shallow . Phil knew he had at least the inch-deep insight that comes from three decades of therapy . But guess what ? Inch-deep is as far as most people want to go . If the explanation a person is most comfortable with turns out to be , " Well , that 's the hand I was dealt , " why dig when you can pack ? And if you pack , pack light . And light was where Marty Fleck came in . <p> Marty Fleck reduced childhood to " Yes or no : My mother was n't my type . " Answer yes , make some room in your baggage . Answer no , make more room . He could admit to being seduced by a thirty-year-old woman when he was seventeen and two chapters later ( " Does My Baggage Have the Proper Identification ? " ) confess to the reader that nothing happened , he 'd just been trying to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some less gimmicky than others , but the upshot of all of it was America had a new prophet . Marty Fleck . The media waffled , one day proclaiming him the new Mark Twain , the next day dubbing him the " Dalai Lame-ah , " but it waffled on a daily basis and kept the buzz charged through the holidays and beyond . <p> Meanwhile , the offers started coming in . TV , radio , appearance fees with real money and no waving out of a limo window . Phil told Wayne Beiliner to turn them all down . And six months later , when Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? was still on the bestseller list and M. Scott Peck , the author of The Road Less Traveled and People of the Lie , was going out of his way to call Marty Fleck " irrelevant , " the offers had quadrupled . Phil 's publisher , Duffy Hill Press , was begging him for a sequel , claiming it was the least he owed them for keeping his real name out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all made enough money off this nonsense ? " and his editor , Rob Wolfmeyer , laughed and said , " Perfect title for the next book , Marty . " <p> Two nights later , during an opening segment called " New Books , " David Letterman turned a mocked-up cover toward the camera and said , " Well , advice-maven Marty Fleck is at it again with his latest offering , Where Do I Stow All These Bags of Cash I Made off This Crap ? <p> By the time the misinterpretation of Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? had become the mass interpretation of Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? Phil Camp felt he had no choice but to continue hiding behind Marty Fleck , while not completely hiding Marty Fleck . So , a year after hardcover hysteria , he ended up accepting one offer . A twice-weekly syndicated newspaper column for , of all bosses , Excelsior Publications , called " Baggage Handling . " The plan was to systematically de-guru Marty Fleck and have him emerge as a man with no answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had credited him with compartmentalizing their confusion . <p> The money from the syndication deal was hardly lucrative . Enough to live comfortably in a one-bedroom in Astoria . But the money that kept rolling in , now almost nine friggin ' years later , from Where Can I Stow My Baggage ? kept Phil in the enviable sprawling midtown Manhattan three-bedroom . Four bedrooms , if you counted The Pad on the living-room floor . The Pad was Phil 's nickname for the 1 1/4-inch-thick , 7-by-5-foot remnant of a wrestling mat on which he now spent most of his waking and unwaking hours , lying on his back , thanks to this limp . This goddamn limp . <p> Nine months ago , it showed up , unannounced , over the July 4th weekend . Phil was minding his own business and overnight became a forty-six-year-old man with a limp . And not even a good limp . Not even enough to make people feel sorry for him . No , this was the kind of limp that had others feeling sorry for themselves . The " Aw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late " limp . The " Great . Now I suppose we 're only playing nine holes " limp . A limp that favors them . <p> It was no use talking about the pain now . No use talking about something that was always there , but never in the same place in the same way . A pain as impervious to explanation as it was to medication . Over the counter , behind the counter , under the counter , astride the counter . What was the point of discussing this now ? Maybe someday , when he might have an answer when someone asked , " What happened to you ? " Why walk hobbled among those who could not understand , least of all him ? Why talk hobbled ? No game , go home . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
