It would be tough to overlook a bed-and-breakfast located in Jackson Hole , Wyo. , 10 minutes from a buzzing town , five from the Jackson Hole Ski Area , 15 from Grand Teton National Park and just an hour from Yellowstone . But the Wildflower Inn , an actual log cabin built by owners Ken and Sherrie Jern , is a destination in its own right . <P> With its pedestal sinks , cathedral ceilings , luxurious down comforters and ample electricity , the log cabin is not one that Abe Lincoln would recognize . Each of the five guest rooms  --  named for local wildflowers that cover the property  --  has a handcrafted log bed and private bath . Four have decks or balconies , and all face the same view : the Teton mountains . The plushest suite , which extends from the main house , is practically a log cabin of one 's own , complete with Jacuzzi , sitting room and gas fireplace . Common areas include a glass-enclosed solarium , filled with plants and a large hot tub from which to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are praised for delicious food and a homey , welcoming atmosphere . <P> Though most come for the great outdoors , there 's lots to do indoors too . Jackson Hole is considered a world center for Western art , with the National Museum of Wildlife Art and lots of galleries . Says a devotee who recently left Wildflower with recipe cards and a reservation for next winter : " I ca n't wait to see the place all covered in snow "
