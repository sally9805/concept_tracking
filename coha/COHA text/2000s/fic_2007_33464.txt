Karen Carruthers had never thought much of women who filed sexual harassment claims . A woman who could n't hold her own with a man -- any man -- simply did n't have balls . But now , Karen was one of them . Gripping the gearshift of her convertible Mustang Cobra , Karen pressed down hard on the gas and did n't let up until the speedometer hovered near eighty-five . At this time of the day -- only minutes before sunrise -- L.A. ' s 405 Freeway resembled the flatlands of some Midwestern highway . The road was all hers , so she took it . Whenever trouble loomed , Karen did the one thing that soothed her . She drove . For the past few weeks , anxiety had crept into her every thought and buried itself there . But during her freedom drives , as she liked to call them , she felt fearless . Invigorated . Fulfilled . All those empowering words her therapist insisted that she embrace . As the Mustang glided past ninety , the crisp air fanned Karen 's face and she inhaled a healthy gulp that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the cool temperature , she felt a hot exhilarating rush . Not all that different from what she experienced during sex . Really great sex . Zooming past the Santa Monica interchange in a nearly drunken state of euphoria now , Karen almost missed the Mulholland exit . Imitating a stunt she 'd seen in a Bruce Willis movie , she laterally zipped across three lanes , just in time to makeit to the off-ramp . As Karen ascended the short incline to the traffic light ahead , she combed her fingers through her thick mass of strawberry-blond hair , then rubbed her emerald-green eyes . When Karen first reported her allegations of sexual harassment against Henry Randle , she had expected that the man would be fired . But she had not anticipated that Randle would turn around and sue Micronics Corporation . Now Karen was her company 's star witness in his wrongful termination case . A case she wanted nothing to do with . Leaning forward , Karen pressed the CD button and began singing along with Faith Hill . Not until she had made a left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she notice the black sedan a couple of car lengths behind . A longer glimpse in her rearview mirror told her that the car was a BMW with a lone occupant inside . Karen punched off Faith mid-chorus and picked up speed . Her pulse did the same . She passed the University of Judaism at close to seventy . The sedan sped up as well . And then it hit her . The documents ! Karen snatched her purse from the passenger 's seat , fished out an envelope and stuffed it down her sweater and into her bra . She had known all along that they would eventually come looking for the documents . Feeling them against her skin sent an icy chill through her body . Karen inhaled and tried to think clearly as trepidation gradually sucked the air from her lungs . The two-mile stretch of Mulholland that lay ahead was interspersed on both sides with outrageously expensive homes and cliffs with made-for-Hollywood views . A sharp turn down one of the long driveways would leave her trapped , making her an easy target for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send her into a nosedive off one of the cliffs , finishing the job for them . Though fear now coursed through every vein in Karen 's body , an odd smile graced her lips . There was no way the BMW would be able to keep up . Her breathing slowed ever so slightly after another glance in the mirror confirmed that her pursuer was losing ground . Karen had cruised Mulholland so many times she could almost drive it blindfolded . She only had to make it down the hill to Beverly Glen . Somebody was bound to be walking a dog or taking an early morning jog . They would not want witnesses . Karen patted her breast , confirming that the envelope was still there . Still safe . Just then another car shot out of a driveway several hundred yards ahead and Karen 's heart slammed against her chest . Instinct told her the BMW to her rear was not working alone . She anxiously felt for the envelope again and concentrated on her next move . She took another quick glance in the rearview mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her left , her eyes bore across the empty passenger seat of the BMW and directly into the barrel of a gun . Time froze for a second , then a piercing scream left Karen 's lips , reverberating into the early morning air . Karen stomped on the brakes and the BMW , unprepared for her sudden stop , darted ahead , just as she had anticipated . What happened next , however , had not been part of Karen 's plan . She jerked the steering wheel sharply to the left and hit the gas . But instead of making a full U-turn , the Mustang headed off the road , straight toward a thin patch of bushes where a guardrail should have been . Karen 's hands flew to her face , barely muffling her futile screams . For what seemed like minutes rather than seconds , the Mustang floated across the reddish-orange sky like a wonderfully woven magic carpet . After a moment of calm , Karen felt the sharp pull of gravity , then braced herself for a landing that turned daybreak into darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honorable Frederick H. Sloan . The judge 's demanding baritone required a response even though no question had been posed . I looked over at Reggie Jenkins , my spineless opposing counsel , seated to my left in the judge 's private chambers . The petrified expression on his face told me I would have to speak for the both of us . " Your Honor , " I began , knowing how much judges loved to hear that salutation , " we 're just too far apart . My client is ready and willing to try this case . " Judge Sloan rolled up the sleeves of his crisp white shirt , revealing more of his flawless tan . Most of the federal judges who sat on the bench in California 's Central District did not fit the typical stereotype of a jurist . Sloan was both tall and handsome and had probably hit the gym during the lunch hour . If it were n't for his lush gray hair , it would have been hard to tell that he had bypassed sixty a few years back . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair away from me and zeroed in on my opponent . " Are you prepared to try this case , too ? " Jenkins inhaled and scratched the back of his neck . A chubby , middle-aged black man , he had chronically chapped lips and wore a short Afro that always looked uncombed . His beige linen suit needed a good pressing and his tie was as crooked as he was . " Oh , no , Your Honor . " Jenkins cracked the knuckles of his right hand against the palm of his left . " I do n't like wasting the taxpayers ' time and money . " I wanted to bop Reggie on the head with my purse . He settled all of his cases because he was too incompetent to go to trial . Judge Sloan swung back to me and smiled heartily . " I 've seen very few cases that were slam dunks . You sure you want to try this case , little lady ? " Little lady ? I hated it when judges talked to me like I was some bimbo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty impressive stats on my Bar card . I was a senior associate at O'Reilly &; Finney , one of the most respected trial firms in L.A. I had also won a five-million-dollar verdict in a race discrimination case and defended a high-profile murder case . But taking crap from judges was par for the course . Before I could respond , the judge returned his focus to my rival . " Mr. Jenkins , what 's your client looking for ? " " Your Honor , " I interrupted , " my client really wants to try this --  " Sloan held up a hand the size of a dinner plate , but did not look my way . " I 'm talking to Mr. Jenkins right now . " He grabbed a handful of roasted almonds from a crystal dish on the corner of his desk and tossed a couple into his mouth . " W-well , Your Honor , " Jenkins stuttered , " my client , Henry Randle , was fired based on trumped-up charges of sexual harassment . He was really terminated because he 's a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the company 's fraudulent billing practices . He --  " I could n't contain myself . " That 's not true . Your client was fired for grabbing Karen Carruthers in an elevator and trying to kiss her . And there 's absolutely no evidence that --  " This time the judge cut me off with a raised hand and a stone-hard glare . " Ms .... uh ... " " Henderson , " I said , annoyed that he could n't even remember my name . " Vernetta Henderson . " " Ms. Henderson , you will speak only when I ask you to . " I locked my arms across my chest and slumped a little in my chair . When a federal judge called for order , he usually got it . " Mr. Jenkins , " the judge continued brusquely , " I know the facts . Let 's cut to the chase . Make Ms. Henderson an offer . " Jenkins looked timidly in my direction and took a long moment before speaking . " I believe I could get my client to accept five hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " I said , ignoring the judge 's gag order . Judge Sloan leaned forward and stroked his chin . " I 'm afraid I would have to agree . Give us a more realistic number , Mr. Jenkins . What 's your bottom line ? " Reggie looked down at his hands . " I ... uh ... I guess if my client received something in the neighborhood of thirty thousand , he might accept it . " Thirty thousand . I mindlessly doodled on the legal pad on my lap . That was a good offer . My client , Micronics Corporation , would easily spend ten times that in attorneys ' fees by the time the trial was over . But Micronics 's litigation philosophy mandated trying winnable cases , even when they could be settled for nuisance value . They firmly believed that if a plaintiff 's attorney litigated a case for months or years and netted nothing for his efforts , he would think twice before suing the company a second time , knowing the battle that awaited him . Truth be told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . If everything remained on schedule , my anticipated victory in the Randle case would come about a week before my law firm 's partnership vote . Having another big win under my belt days before the vote would cinch things for me . I would soon become O'Reilly &; Finney 's first African-American partner . I was not about to let Judge Sloan steal my thunder . " Your Honor , " I said , looking him fearlessly in the eyes , " my client is n't interested in settlement . " Sloan propped an elbow on the desk and pointed at me with a finger the size of a wiener . " You and your client are making a big mistake , " he said with a controlled fury . I swallowed hard and said nothing . Pissing off a judge , particularly a federal judge , would mean hell for me the next time I appeared in Sloan 's courtroom . He could be as retaliatory as he wanted with no fear of repercussions . One of the many perks of having a job for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started writing . " You want to try this case ? " he said with a cruel smile , " then you 've got it . I 'm expediting the filing of the pretrial documents . I want the trial brief , the jury instructions and all motions filed by Monday morning . And I 'd like to see you two back here Tuesday afternoon for another status report . " " Your Honor ! " Jenkins whined , cracking the knuckles of both hands this time . " I 'm a solo practitioner . There 's no way I can get all those documents drafted in four days . " He took a Chap Stick from his jacket pocket and nervously dotted his lips . " That 's not my problem , Mr. Jenkins . Perhaps you 'll be able to talk some sense into Ms. Henderson before Monday morning . " The judge grabbed another handful of almonds . " You can leave now . " As I followed Jenkins down a long hallway that led back to the main courtroom , a flutter of apprehension hit me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash of self-doubt did not linger . Reggie was a lousy attorney . Going up against him would be like trying a case against a first-year law student . The Randle case was going to trial and I was going to win it .
