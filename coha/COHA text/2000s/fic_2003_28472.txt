Chapter One He picked her up in his headlights as he came around the curve . She stood beside the narrow lake road , thumb out . He slowed to make sure before he stopped , but his blood was already pounding . Yes . Long blond hair , sun-kissed bare limbs , sixteen , seventeen tops . She wore a pink T-shirt that hugged her small breasts and navy shorts that exposed slim , coltish legs and , as he stopped the car beside her , he saw that she had The Look . He was a sucker for The Look . That cool , confi-dent conviction that her life was only just beginning , that she would live forever , that nothing would harm her . It was a look that came only with youth . " Hey , " he said as he rolled down the passenger-side window and leaned over to smile at her . " Where ya headed ? " She stepped closer , bending at the waist to look in at him . " Bigfork ? " Her sweet scent rushed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of his favorites . She hooked a hand over the open window frame . Her fingernails were painted a pale pink . He really liked that . On her slim , tanned wrist a tiny silver charm bracelet with a perfect little silver heart tinkled softly . He could hardly contain himself . " Hop in , I 'm going that way . You must be in Bigfork working for the summer . " He did n't want to make the mistake of trying to pick up a local girl again . She nodded , stepped closer . It always came down to a few crucial seconds . She glanced at his car , then at him again . In her blue eyes he saw that instant of uncertainty that could save - or destroy - her . Seconds . Life or death . He loved this part . " Thanks , " she said and reached for the door handle . Ai n't no big , bad wolf here . He smiled . All teeth . * * * Jill Lawson could n't believe it . Trevor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his parents ' anniversary masquerade party . This time she was dressed as Scarlett O'Hara and feeling foolish as she waited in a far wing of the house , alone . This time was going to be the last time . " I ca n't marry this man . I 'm breaking off the engagement . " The words echoed in the dark , empty room . " Tonight . " She watched the approaching thunderstorm move across the lake and waited for the aftershock of her decision . She had expected to feel something other than ... relief . Certainly more regret . She did n't . This far down the east wing of the Foresters ' massive lake house the sounds of the ongoing party were muted . That was one of the reasons she had come down here . To get away from all the merriment and the reminder that she was alone , the engagement ring on her finger feeling suddenly too tight . The ache in her heart too familiar . She ached for something she was n't even sure existed except maybe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe the earth to move ? Really , Jill , you are such a fool , " Trevor had said when she 'd tried to voice her concerns the last time she 'd seen him . Well , she certainly felt like a fool tonight , she thought . She had hardly seen Trevor since he 'd asked her to marry him , but when he 'd called , he 'd promised that tonight would be different . After all , it was his parents ' thirty-fifth anniversary , and summer was almost over , another season gone . Heddy and Alistair threw a costume party to celebrate the event at the end of August every year at their house on the east shore of Flathead Lake . This year the theme was famous lovers , and Trevor had insisted Jill come as Scarlett so he could be Rhett Butler . And he 'd stood her up . " Quite frankly , Rhett , I do n't give a damn , " she said to the dark room . A lie . She did give a damn . She had wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd made her believe he was . She looked down at the silver charm bracelet on her wrist , the tiny heart dangling from the chain , and remembered the night he 'd given it to her . On her birthday two months ago . It was right after that when he 'd asked her to marry him and had given her the antique engagement ring now on her finger . Her instincts warned her that everything between her and Trevor had happened too fast . She 'd let him bowl her over , not giving her time to think . Or hardly react . And suddenly she was engaged to a man she did n't really know . He 'd been involved in his construction project , an upscale resort he called Inspiration Island south of Bigfork , Montana , in the middle of Flathead Lake , almost since they 'd started dating . Admittedly , he had been working a lot . A week ago he 'd stopped by her bakery and she 'd barely recognized him . He was tanned , leaner , more muscular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good he 'd looked and quickly was reminded that he had only made love to her once , soon after the engagement . In the weeks since , he always had an excuse - he was too tired or had to meet one of the investors or had to get back to the island . " Everything will be different once we 're married , " he 'd promised . " Right , " she said to the dark . She did n't believe that . Did n't believe anything Trevor told her anymore . " We 're never going to know if things will be different because I 'm not marrying you , Trevor Forester . " She spun around in surprise . Someone had come into the dark room without her realizing it . How long had he or she been there , listening ? A small table lamp came on , blinding her for an instant . She thought at first the other person was Trevor and she would get this over with quickly . This quiet wing of the house would serve her purpose well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
