<p> In any other year , you punt . But in a year that has defied tradition , logic and imperial order in college football , why the hell not listen to Juice Williams when he 's pleading to attempt the unfathomable ? Why not realize the underdog is the favorite these days , a horseshoe can be a curse and anything is possible in this crazy sport , including a coach who looks like David Crosby maybe winning a national championship at ... Kansas ? <p> There was Juice , trying to win the Heisman Trophy in a single afternoon , having willed Illinois to a 28-14 lead inside the legendary oval at Ohio State . On fourth down with just under seven minutes left , it counters every law of sane strategy to do anything but kick away . Even Ron Zook , known to push the coaching envelope , wanted to punt . But the Illini were mere inches from a first down that would suck the life out of Ohio Stadium . And the prophet Isiah John Williams , as he is known beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild side and shake the college landscape with its biggest jolt yet . <p> " Coach , I will get it , " Juice promised . <p> " You 'd better get it , " Zook said . <p> You know the rest . As sure as Appalachian State beat Michigan , Stanford beat USC , South Florida soared to No. 2 , Notre Dame sank to the sludge and basketball schools such as Kansas , Missouri and Connecticut veered into the upper rankings of the fall sport , the Illini shot down any lucidity that remained nationally . Behind a breakout performance by Williams , who sneaked for the first down on a day when he burned the nation 's best defense with four touchdown passes and timely dashes , they pulled off the program 's greatest conquest in eons , a 28-21 clocking of the top-ranked Buckeyes . <p> This is the victory that confirms the Illini 's return as serious player . It also symbolizes delicious redemption for Zook , who was run out of Florida because he could n't coach the big-time talent he recruited . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Guenther , whose program was so depressed that he was happy to stumble upon a name familiar to the masses . No one expected more than a middle-of-the-road Big 10 program , but Zook sold Champaign-Urbana like it was Maui in the Midwest and lifted the total attitude by sheer force of his 24-7 workaholism . He recruited so well , he frustrated Charlie Weis into a tizzy at Notre Dame . He marketed so aggressively , the New York Times looked into recruiting irregularities  --  and found nothing . Then he beat Penn State and Wisconsin at home , opening eyes around the land . <p> Grabbing our attention <p> But not until Saturday evening did the Illini crash the national picture , not only in a SportsCenter sense but in the homes of recruits . If Zook could sign the likes of Williams and Arrelious Benn when the program was down , what kind of damage will he do now ? Kids from Chicago who used to dream of Notre Dame now laugh at the place , with Weis now 1-9 and needing to reimburse some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come when Illinois football was hot , recalling a 40-2 orange crushing in the horseshoe two years ago . But in short order , The Zooker has blown past the Bears , the Bulls and every other team in our parts to become the grandest story of autumn . <p> " We won ' cause our guys believed they could hang in there , " said Zook , close to tears on the ABC telecast . " I said it was going to be different when we came back here in two years . For our guys to come in and do what they did , that 's a tribute to them . We 've come a long way , we really have . I 'm so proud of our players and how they 've bought into what we said they 've got to do . I 'm so happy for Illini Nation ; these people have taken us in . It 's a neat thing , it really is . " <p> And you know what 's neatest about it ? His players were n't even that shocked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overused , " Illini linebacker J Leman told reporters in Columbus . " It is pretty shocking to most people , but not to the guys in the locker room . " <p> It 's a shame the Illini lost a bummer at Iowa and fell short at home against Michigan . Otherwise , they 'd be looking at a BCS game and probably their first Rose Bowl berth in 24 years  --  or , before any player on the current team was born . And a season-opening defeat that seemed so painful at the time  --  40-34 to Missouri  --  suddenly does n't look so bad with the Tigers about to climb into the top five . The Illini will play in a nice bowl game , but if the powers-that-be had any brains and instituted a tournament , they are the kind of team that is getting hot at the right time  --  like a basketball team in March . They 'll have to settle for throwing the Bowl Championship Series outlook into complete disarray , just as the BCS clowns deserve . <p> The only way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos . And that 's exactly what we have . My guess , is , someone is going to be very , very mad when the BCS title teams are announced because the several aspirants are bunched so closely . LSU deserves to be No. 1 for now and Oregon will be No. 2 , but what if undefeated Kansas and their round mound of a coach , Mark Mangino , run the table and beat two top 5 teams in Missouri and Oklahoma in the coming weeks ? The Jayhawks will deserve to go to the title game , making Bill Self the No. 2 guy in Lawrence and Kirk Hinrich less of a legend than quarterback Todd Reesing . Even if they lose once , there will be a debate involving at least three one-loss teams and probably a few more  --  which is the BCS ' worst nightmare . <p> A running game and Juice , too <p> So thank you , Illini , for hopefully pushing us closer to a sensible alternative . Who knew they 'd be able to run on a defense that had allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their first run of the game , an 80-yard burst by Daniel Dufrene that led to Juice 's first touchdown pass and reminded the crowd that no one would be laying down . Everyone ran all over the Buckeyes  --  Williams , Rashard Mendenhall , Dufrene  --  for a whopping 256 yards . But nothing was bigger than Juice squeezing a few inches out of Ohio State 's heart . <p> We are n't certain of much as college football spins madly . But in a brave new world , The Zooker has staked out his turf for an electric future . We know the man can recruit . We know the man can hyperventilate.
