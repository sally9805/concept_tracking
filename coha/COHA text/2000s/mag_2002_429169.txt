culture in context Headnote These days , Hollywood is focusing on dads and men working in child care . Is the church doing the same ? // DADS ARE SUDDENLY BACK IN SEASON , AND ON TV and down at the local cineplex , guys are rediscovering the joys and challenges of child care . Indeed , we have n't seen so many TV fathers taking care of their children since Fred MacMurray and Lorne Greene ruled over the roost in My Three Sons and Bonanza , or Andy Griffith and Bill Bixby proved that dad knew best in The Andy Griffith Show and The Courtship of Eddie 's Father . Dennis Franz , of all people , may have started this rush to join the diaper brigade when widowed NYPD Blue 's Andy Sipowicz took over parenting his cuter-than-a-button son Theo a couple years back . Now the bull-in-a-china shop Sipowicz has to arrange baby-sitting before he can work overtime on a case , and the show , once famous for parting shots of its romantic leads in the buff , now regularly closes with Franz reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of single dads swelled a bit more with the introduction of Richard Dreyfuss ' new TV drama , The Education of Max Bickford . An irascible prof at a small women 's college , Max is trying to raise two children , negotiate the comic melodrama of faculty squabbles , and awaken the intellect of his students while mired in a middleaged funk . ( Imagine Mr. Holland 's Opus goes to college as a crusty widower and you get the general idea . ) He gets fairly low marks as a dad from his teenage daughter , but ( like Sipowicz ) is a big hit with his preadolescent son . Kevin Kline is in more of an end-of-life funk when he takes up the challenges of parenting in last fall 's movie Life as a House . Divorced and directionless , George Monroe ( Kline ) is a miserable human being who , when he gets fired and diagnosed with cancer on the same day , decides it 's time to do some serious renovation of his life . So he tells ex-wife Kristin Scott Thomas he wants their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the summer , and while constructing his new home the dying George tries to make up for a decade of absentee parenting . Not surprisingly , this strategy works better for Kline than it might for a real father , and by August the embittered suicidal druggie teenager is crying " I love you " to his bedridden pop . Photograph // Still , the most striking new story about men caring for children has to be The Guardian , a television drama about a corporate lawyer who becomes a child advocate when sentenced to 1,500 hours of community service for a drug bust . What makes The Guardian so intriguing is that its central character , Nick Fallin ( Simon Baker ) , is a man whose job is taking care of children . Unlike Sipowicz , Bickford , and Monroe , who watch over their own children , Fallin introduces us to a male hero who ( more or less ) cares for children for a living . In him child care becomes an honorable profession even for a man . THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER PROFESSIONAL CARETAKERS ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Family Law Kathleen Quinn and Dixie Carter lead a mostly female cast of attorneys protecting children in family court , and in Judging Amy Amy Brenneman administers justice and mercy in these courts , while her social worker mom Tyne Daly cares for abandoned and abused tots and adolescents . And , like most working women ( but not the male partners in Family Law ) , these characters have their own children and grandchildren to worry about when they 're at work and watch over when they 're not , reinforcing the idea that at home or in the office , child care is women 's work . So it 's worth noticing when a drama comes along suggesting that child care can be a man 's job as well . Curiously enough , just as single dads are enjoying a renaissance on TV and videos , the number of real-life fathers raising kids on their own has also skyrocketed , though their growing ranks are still dwarfed by the legions of single moms . As Jeff Gillenkirk reported in a piece in America magazine last year , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children is growing at almost twice the rate of single mothers . " Single dads now make up a little more than 20 percent of single-parent households and 2.1 percent of all U.S. households , and today nearly 30 percent of working single parents are men . There are currently about 2.2 million single fathers serving as the primary caretakers for children under 18 . MEANWHILE , DADS IN TWO-PARENT households also are picking up a bigger ( though not equal ) share of household and child care duties . With more than 60 percent of mothers now working outside the home , many of their husbands are spending more time with the children , often resulting in an increase of parental time and attention . On average , fathers are spending five more hours a week with their children than just two decades ago . About a third of dual career couples commit themselves to sharing housekeeping and child care tasks equitably . Still , in most households where both parents work outside the home , wives typically do more child care tasks than their spouses . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the past few decades , the awful truth is that we do not value the work of caring for our children ( or elderly ) in the same way we prize other types of labor . Lots of our movies and Mother 's Day homilies romanticize and pay lip service to the vocation of caring for and raising our children , and we all agree that this is the most critical task of any civilization . But when it comes time to assign income and status to those who perform this critical , time-consuming , and messy job , we are a great deal less generous . All too often we end up trying to give this job away to folks who are unskilled , uneducated , foreign-born , and overwhelmingly female . In 1988 the U.S. Catholic bishops wrote that " both parents ought to be encouraged to view their involvement in raising children and contributing to personality formation as a participation in the most critical vocation in the church . The husband has an obligation to share in the domestic chores and in the care of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children benefit from the guidance and involvement of both parents . " TELLING MEN THAT THEY SHOULD share in " domestic chores and in the care of children " is a new tactic in Catholic thought . For a long time the church has tried to ensure someone was available to take care of our children by arguing that mothers should not be coerced into the labor force . Fathers , the church has said , should be paid enough to support their families . But this approach ignores the aspiration of women to become architects , teachers , doctors , judges , carpenters , cops , and clergy , and overlooks the fact that these moms will need parenting partners at home . It also reinforces the bias that child care and housekeeping are women 's work and implies that these labors should be voluntary , unpaid ( or at least underpaid ) activities . So when women entered the labor force in droves , church teaching did n't challenge the assumption that they should continue to do all the housework and child care as pro bono work , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on their vocation , and did n't argue that the workplace should give mothers and fathers time to do the socially critical work of raising our children . Calling child care and parenting the " most critical vocation in the church " seems revolutionary in a church where we long accorded that honor to celibate males and where bishops do n't do child care or housekeeping . Still , if the bishops really want child care and parenting to be seen as the " most critical vocation , " we need to teach our daughters and sons to see it as work that men and professionals do . Maybe next Holy Thursday the bishops ( and some CEOs ) could do some diapers .
