With a movie called Be Cool , the cast had better , well , be cool . In next year 's sequel to the 1995 Mob flick Get Shorty , chill rapper ANDRE 3000 ( real identity : Andre Benjamin ) and Bill killer UMA THURMAN ( real identity : foxy movie-star mama ) supply the requisite edge . Andre , the sex-symbol half of the Grammy-winning hip-hop duo OutKast , plays Dabu " a trigger-happy parody of all rappers , " he says . " He 's a dude from the street , and he 's kind of crazy . He 'll be in a normal conversation just itching to shoot somebody . " Thurman 's Edie runs a record label that 's in debt to Dabu , but she 's being protected by boyfriend and entrepreneurial mobster Chili Palmer ( John Travolta ) . This is the first meaty film role for Andre , who had a bit part in last year 's Hollywood Homicide . He is next set to play Jimi Hendrix in a biopic . " Once you 're an entertainer , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In movies , you can actually play a real person . " And we thought only audiences escaped in the cinema .
