Chapter One The Right Place at the Right Time Two decades ago Knoxville , Tennessee DECKER HAWTHORNE He typed out the letters of his name and his hands paused on the keys . Quickly his eyes scanned the editorial for one last reassurance that he had n't misspelled something , or that he could n't say something just a little more convincingly , or perhaps improve the sentence structure . Finally he decided it would have to do . The deadline had passed , the newspaper was waiting to be put to bed , and Decker had a plane to catch . As he left the offices of the Knoxville Enterprise , he stopped to straighten the hand-lettered placard that hung outside the door . It was a weekly paper , small by most standards , but it was growing . Decker had started the paper with a short supply of money and an abundance of navet , and it was still a struggle to survive financially . The upside was that with Decker 's aggressive style , the Enterprise frequently scooped the two local dailies , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been an overachiever who was n't afraid to take chances , and while he lost more often than he won , he liked to believe he had a knack for being in the right place at the right time . Right now he was supposed to be at the airport , but he was n't . " You 're going to miss your plane , " called Elizabeth , Decker 's wife . " I 'm coming , " he called back . " Start the car . " " It 's already running . I know you too well . " They made it to the gate with three minutes to spare , but Decker did n't want to waste one second sitting on the plane when he could spend it with Elizabeth . After only three months of marriage , he was n't looking forward to being away from his bride for two weeks , but finally he had to board the plane or be left behind . As the plane left the runway , Decker looked out over the city of Alcoa on the southern outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on the edge of one of Alcoa 's parks . The steadily receding sight recalled disquieting emotions . Decker had spent most of his life traveling . As a boy it was with his family , moving from one army post to another . After that he had spent a year and a half hitchhiking across the United States and Canada ; then four years in the army . Partly he felt cheated : He had never really had a home . But partly he felt blessed . Decker hated leaving , but he loved going . Decker 's flight arrived late into New York and he had to run to make his connecting flight to Milan , Italy . Nearing the gate , he looked for a familiar face but saw none . In fact , at first glance , there was no one at the gate at all . Decker looked out the window . There was the plane , but at that instant he heard the jet engines begin to whine . Thundering down the red-carpeted incline of the jetway , he almost collided with a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane ! " he told the woman , as he put on the sweetest " help me " look he could muster . " You have your passport ? " she asked . " Right here , " Decker answered , handing it to her along with his ticket . " What about your luggage ? " " This is it , " he answered , holding up an overstuffed and somewhat oversized carry-on bag . The plane had not actually moved yet , so after notifying the pilot , it was an easy task to move the jetway back into place . After a quick but heartfelt thank you , Decker boarded the plane and headed to his seat . Now he saw a sea of friendly and familiar faces . On his right was John Jackson , the team 's leader . A few seats back was Eric Jumper . Both were from the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs . Jackson had his Ph.D . in physics and had worked extensively on lasers and particle beams . Jumper , also a Ph.D. , was an engineer specializing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost everyone in this sea of faces had a Ph.D . of one sort or another . Altogether there were more than forty scientists , technicians , and support people . Though he knew most only by sight , many paused long enough from their conversations to offer a smile of welcome or to say they were glad he had not missed the flight . Decker found his seat and sat down . There to greet him was Professor Harry Goodman , a sloppily dressed , short man with gray hair , reading glasses half-way down his nose , and thick bushy eyebrows that blazed helter-skelter across his brow and up onto his forehead like a brush fire . " I was beginning to think you 'd stood me up , " Professor Goodman said . " I would n't have missed this for the world , " Decker answered . " I just wanted to make a big entrance . " Professor Goodman was Decker 's link to the rest of the team . Goodman had taught biochemistry at the University of Tennessee when Decker was in pre-med . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research assistant . They had many conversations , and though Goodman was not the type to get very close to anyone , Decker felt they were friends . Later that same year , though , Goodman had grown very depressed about something he refused to discuss . Through the rumor mill Decker discovered that Goodman was going to be refused tenure . Primarily this could be traced to his policy of " Do now , ask permission later , " which had gotten him into hot water with the dean on more than one occasion . The next semester Goodman took a position at UCLA and Decker had not seen him since . Decker , for unrelated reasons , had changed his major from pre-med to journalism . He was still an avid reader of some of the better science journals , however . So it was that Decker read an article in Science magazine about a team of American scientists going to examine the Shroud of Turin , a religious relic believed by many to be the burial shroud of Jesus Christ . He had heard of the Shroud but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud designed to pick the pockets of gullible worshipers . But here was an article in one of the most widely read science journals reporting that credible American scientists were actually taking their time to examine this thing . At first the article had aroused only amused disbelief , but among the list of the scientists involved , Decker found the name Dr. Harold Goodman . This made no sense at all . Goodman , as Decker knew from his frequent pronouncements , was an atheist . Well , not exactly an atheist . Goodman liked to talk about the uncertainty of everything . In his office at the university were two posters . The first was crudely hand-printed and stated : " Goodman 's First Law of Achievement : The shortest distance between any two points is around the rules " ( a philosophy which obviously had not set well with the dean ) . The second poster was done in a late 1960s-style psychedelic print and said : " I think , therefore , I am . I think . " Mixing the uncertainty of his own existence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself as " an atheist by inclination but an agnostic by practice . " So why was a man like Goodman going off on some ridiculous expedition to study the Shroud of Turin ? Decker filed the information away in his memory and probably would have left it there had it not been for a phone call from an old friend , Tom Donafin . Tom was a reporter for the Courier in Waltham , Massachusetts , and had called about a story he was working on about corruption in banking-something that Knoxville had plenty of at that time . After discussing the banking story Tom asked Decker if he had seen the article in Science . " Yeah , I saw it , " Decker answered . " Why ? " " I just thought you 'd be interested in what old Bushy Brows was up to , " Tom laughed . " Are you sure it 's him ? I did n't see him in any of the pictures . " " At first I did n't think it was possible , but I did a little checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Decker said , thinking out loud , " there might be a story here . Religion sells . " " If you mean covering the expedition , I think you 're right , but security is really tight . I tried to dig into the particulars a little , but hit a brick wall . They 're limiting coverage of the expedition to one reporter : a guy from the National Geographic . " " That sounds like a challenge to me , " Decker said . " Oh , I 'm not saying it ca n't be done , but it wo n't be easy . " Decker began to muse how he might , if he wanted to , go about getting the story . He could take the direct approach of trying to reason with whoever was making the rules . After all , why should they have only one journalist ? On the other hand , what possible reason could he give to convince them to take someone from a tiny unknown weekly in Knoxville , Tennessee ? Clearly , his best bet was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made several attempts to reach his old professor , but without success . Goodman was doing research somewhere in Japan and even his wife , Martha , was n't sure exactly where he was . With little to depend on beyond luck and determination , Decker arranged to fly to Norwich , Connecticut , and booked a room in the hotel where the Shroud team was scheduled to meet over the Labor Day weekend . He arrived the day before to look things over . The next morning Decker found that a private dining room in the hotel had been prepared for about fifty people . Checking with one of the waiters , he quickly confirmed that this was where the Shroud team was meeting . A few minutes later the first of the team members walked into the room . The eyebrows were unmistakable . " Professor Goodman , " Decker said , as he approached Goodman and extended his right hand . Goodman looked puzzled . " It 's Hawthorne , " Decker offered . It was obvious that Goodman was struggling to place the face . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam of recognition began to show in the pale green eyes beneath the massive clumps of hair . " Oh , yes , Hawthorne ! Well , how the heck are you ? What are you doing here in Connecticut ? " Before Decker could answer , another person entered the room and called out , " Harry Goodman ! " and came over to where they were standing . " So , where were you last night ? I called your room , hoping to have dinner with you . " Goodman did not respond but proceeded instead to formal introductions . " Professor Don Stanley , allow me to introduce Decker Hawthorne , a former student and research assistant of mine from the University of Tennessee , Knoxville . " Professor Stanley shook Decker 's hand , gave him a quick onceover , and then looked back at Goodman . " So Hawthorne here must be the research assistant that I heard you 'd suckered into helping out . What a shame , " Stanley added , pausing and looking back at Decker , " I 'd have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " responded Goodman , " and , unfortunately , so is the young man you 're referring to . " " Oh , so he jumped ship on you , did he ? " responded Stanley with a chuckle . " Well , after all , " Goodman shrugged , " it is quite a lot to expect a young man to pay the cost of an airline ticket to Turin , Italy , just to go on a wild goose chase . " Decker let none of this escape his attention . The possibility of replacing the missing research assistant provided a much better chance of getting onto the team than did the direct approach of getting the team to accept a second reporter . Now it was just a matter of waiting for the right opening . " If you 're so sure it 's a goose chase , why do you insist on going along ? " Stanley asked . " Somebody 's got to keep the rest of you honest , " Goodman said , with a grin . By now several other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering in small groups for conversation . One of the men caught Professor Stanley 's attention and Stanley walked over to greet the new arrival . Decker seized the opportunity to question Professor Goodman further about the missing assistant . " What is it exactly that your research assistant was going to do on this trip ? " Decker asked . " Oh , everything from collection of data to general gofer work . We 've got hundreds of different experiments planned and we may have as little as twelve hours to do them all . It 's the kind of environment where an extra pair of trained hands can be very helpful . " " I do n't suppose you 'd be interested in a substitute ? " Decker asked . He was counting on the fact that Goodman did n't know he had switched his major from pre-med to journalism after Goodman left the University of Tennessee . Decker felt a twinge of guilt , but this certainly was n't the biggest omission of fact he had ever used to get a story . Besides , he was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could certainly qualify as a gofer . " What ? " Goodman responded . " After I just told Professor Stanley you were too smart for such a thing ? " " Really , I 'd like to go , " Decker insisted . " Actually , that 's why I came here . I may be a little rusty , but I read the article in Science and I 've got experience with most of the equipment you 'll be using . " " What you read was just the beginning . " Goodman paused long enough to frown and then continued , " Well , I 'm not going to refuse help , but you know that you have to pay your own way : airfare , hotel , food , transportation ? " " Yeah , I know , " Decker answered . " But why ? " asked Goodman . " You have n't gone and gotten religion , have you ? " " No , nothing like that . It just sounds like an interesting project . " Decker realized it was n't a very convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why are you going ? " he asked . " You do n't believe in any of this stuff . " " Of course not ! I just want a chance to debunk this whole thing . " Decker refocused the conversation . " So , can I come along or not ? " " Yeah , well , I guess so ; if you 're sure about it . I 'll just need to talk to Eric , " he said , referring to one of the team 's de facto leaders , Eric Jumper . " We 'll have to get your name added to the list of team members . The security on this thing is really tight . " So , just that quickly , Decker was in . " The right place at the right time , " he whispered to himself . It would take forty-eight years for him to realize it had been far more than that . After breakfast the team moved to a conference room . Decker stayed close to Goodman so that as they passed through the security check , Goodman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of those allowed in . Inside , team leader John Jackson called the meeting to order . " In order to get approval to work on the Shroud , " Jackson began , " we 've had to promise the authorities in Turin that we would maintain the strictest security . Obviously , our biggest problem is going to be the press . " Decker struggled not to smile . " The best approach is simply not to even talk about the Shroud to anyone who 's not on the team . As far as anyone outside of this room is concerned , we 're still waiting for permission to do the testing . " Eric Jumper took the floor when Jackson finished . " Ladies and Gentlemen , thank you for coming . It 's really a thrill to have a chance to be associated with such a distinguished group of scientists . Now , we 've gotten most of the protocols for the proposed experiments , but those we have n't received need to be in by the end of this coming weekend . " Continues ...  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
