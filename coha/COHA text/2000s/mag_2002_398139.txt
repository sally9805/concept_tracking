SCOPE REVIEWS Headnote Astronomy reviews three popular first-time telescopes // Many newcomers to astronomy are drawn to the increasingly popular computerized telescopes . Admittedly , they do have a certain appeal - you simply tell the telescope what you want to observe , and then it steers itself to the target automatically . While these " Go-to " scopes may be the answer for some , they certainly are not for others . Many stargazers prefer to observe the night sky the old-fashioned way by learning the stars and finding objects on their own . For this type of novice , one of the most popular first-time telescopes , especially for young astronomers , is a 4.5  --  inch Newtonian reflector on a German equatorial mount . How many of us " old timers " started out with that kind of instrument ? Probably quite a few . They offer basic transportation to the stars , while not overwhelming the user with too many bells and whistles . Unfortunately , many such instruments have inherited the label " department-store telescopes . " These telescopes are often characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woefully small finderscopes . Noting this , several companies upgraded their line of beginner telescopes . The three instruments evaluated here are some of the results . All include rack-and  --  pinion focusers that accept standard 11/4 " eyepieces , reasonably sturdy mountings , and usable finders . I recently compared three 4.5-inch Newtonian reflectors : The Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ , the Celestron Firstscope 114 Short , and the Swift 864 . All were compared side-by-side from my suburban backyard on Long Island under viewing conditions typical for most Astronomy readers and potential consumers . Standard Equipment One look at the three telescopes side-by-side and it 's immediately clear that all are not the same " under the hood . " The Celestron Firstscope 114 Short is much shorter than the others . However , if you look at their specifications , you 'll find that all three telescopes have roughly the same focal length . While the Swift 864 and Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ are traditional Newtonian reflectors , the Celestron First 114 Short has an extra ingredient : An achromatic " auxiliary " lens in the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extender - in effect , a built-in 2.25x Barlow lens . This lens takes the f/4 primary mirror and extends the overall system focal ratio to f/9 . ( Unlike conventional Barlows , however , the telescope will not come to a focus without this auxiliary lens in place . ) As a result , the telescope 's length and weight is reduced , making the 114 Short easier to carry in and out for a night 's observing .

And all are equipped with manual slow-motion controls on right ascension and declination axes , small setting circles , and locking latitude-adjustment screws and reference scales . The Swift 864 features a 6x30 finderscope , while the Celestrons include red-dot " unity finders . " These unique finders allow users to stare through a 7/8-inch diameter window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky beyond , allowing you to aim the telescope at a selected celestial target . Unlike the Swift 's 6x30 finder , these do not magnify the view nor do they make dim stars appear brighter . In fact , each red-dot finder has a reddish coating on its window that reduces star brightness by one-half magnitude . Finally , the telescopes all come with two or more 11/4 " eyepieces . The Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ includes 10mm and 25mm Modified Achromat ( MA ) eyepieces , while the Firstscope 114 Short comes with less spectacular 6mm and 20mm Huygenian eyepieces . The Swift 864 comes with 10mm and 25mm Plossl eyepieces - the best of the bunch . Mechanics As already mentioned , each telescope comes on a German equatorial mount and an adjustable aluminum tripod . The sturdiest ( but also heaviest ) mount is the CG-3 supplied with the Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ . The Swift mount proves sturdy enough for its telescope , as does the small mount for the Celestron " short " telescope . To keep the telescope from shifting its aim , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , although the thumbscrews used on the Celestron Firstscope 114 Short are too small to find easily at night Although larger , the Swift 's knobs were inconveniently placed ; I often found myself brushing up against the gearing instead , getting its sticky grease on my fingers . The locking knobs on the Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ were easy to find and tighten . Normally , these reflectors are aimed by hand at first , then fine-tuned by turning a pair of slow-motion flex arms . Motions in right ascension and declination were smooth on all three instruments . The arms on the Celestron GG-3 are long and flexible , which easily move out of the way if the telescope tube happens to press against them - an inevitability at certain viewing angles . The shorter , stiffer adjustment arms on the other mounts tended to get in the way . In fact , I ended up leaving off the right-ascension arms on the other scopes and adjusted their aim by turning small wheels on the right ascension axes instead . Each telescope holds its primary mirror in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs of screws . One screw in each pair pushes against the inner portion of the cell that holds the mirror , while the second pulls on it to equal out the force . Loosen one in the pair and turn the other to adjust the primary 's collimation . The Celestron cells use nice , knurled knobs for adjusting the mirror 's tilt and a Phillips screw to lock everything into place . The Swift , however , forces one to use a Phillips screwdriver to adjust the mirror 's tilt , which is less convenient . At the other end of the tube , the secondary-mirror holders are fully adjustable , requiring a small Phillips screwdriver to change the mirror 's tilt . The Celestrons use single-vane mounts , while the Swift uses a three-vane spider . Optics Each telescope was shipped to me directly from its respective company and outfitted with the standard equipment previously mentioned . The assembly of each went quickly and without incident . I believe a rank novice could put any of these instruments together in well under an hour using the tools supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each telescope a quick once-over . I discovered that all but the Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ were out of optical collimation . The primary mirror in the Celestron Firstscope 114 Short needed adjustment , while both the primary and secondary mirrors in the Swift needed attention . Improperly collimated optics will inevitably decrease image quality . This is especially true with " short " instruments , which are , in effect , Barlowed f/4 telescopes . I began my optical tests with the star test , which compares the out-of-focus image of a bright star on one side of focus versus the other . In an ideal reflector , both images should look like identical patterns of concentric rings , with bright outer edges , a darker inner portion , and a bright point in the center . If the two images disagree , then there is a problem , either in the optics or from atmospheric turbulence . A telescope must be properly cooled before attempting the star test , so I left each outside for two hours before I began . Both the Swift and Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved both had very good optics ; I subjectively judged an overall system wavefront of better than 1/4 wave . That 's quite impressive for an " economy " telescope . The Swift showed similar low levels of spherical aberration . The Celestron Short reflector was clearly inferior to the others . After the star test , I wanted to know how the scopes perform on actual objects . Again the Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ and Swift scopes rose to the top . I was especially impressed with Saturn - a very revealing object . Cassini 's Division was clearly and cleanly visible at 76x in both scopes . Mixing eyepieces , Saturn remained surprisingly crisp through both , especially with the Swift , using a 4mm eyepiece ( 230x ) . The rings were much fuzzier through the Celestron Short . I had similar results with Jupiter . The planet 's many bands were best seen through the Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ , followed closely by the Swift 864 . Deep-sky objects showed well through all three telescopes , but especially the Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ and Swift 864 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100x . Indeed , they also showed the elusive companion of Rigel at 76x , a tough task for a 4.5  --  inch telescope . I could resolve the brighter members of globular clusters Ml 13 , M2 , and M15 through each with averted vision , while the Trapezium in M42 was a simple task through both . The Celestron Short reflector could not quite keep up with its longer siblings . For instance , resolution of the Double-Double was possible but was not as crisp as through the others . I believe this effect was the combined result of increased spherical aberration and impact of the auxiliary lens used to stretch the focal length . I also found that focusing the " short " telescope was more difficult . Although the focuser is essentially the same as that on the other Celestron , the focusing motion seemed coarser , likely the effect of a more complex optical configuration . The eyepieces furnished with this type of telescope have come a long way since my first 4-inch reflector more than 30 years ago . Back then most were sold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modified Achromats are superior to those , but can still be improved upon . The Swift 864 comes with 10mm and 25mm Plossl eyepieces , easily the best of the bunch . My recommendation would be to replace the others with a decent set of two or three Plossl eye  --  pieces as well . I found both image sharpness and contrast improved noticeably when I swapped my own eyepieces for those supplied . And the Winner is ... So are these telescopes any good ? The answer is a resounding " yes " for the two traditionally designed instruments . I was surprised at the optical quality of the Swift 864 and Celestron Firstscope 114 EQ . With both properly collimated , the scopes delivered great views of the moon , Jupiter , Saturn , and many deep-sky objects . I also thought they handled magnification well , as evidenced by the sharp views I enjoyed of Jupiter and Saturn at 229x ( 51x per inch ) . I am confident new stargazers will be satisfied with either of these as a first telescope . However , I am less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed reasonably well , the others clearly outdid it . My advice would be to spend a little more money and purchase one of the full-size Newtonians .
