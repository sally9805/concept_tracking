Thirty-three-year-old Payne Sterling glanced up from the screen of his laptop in time to see his favorite niece Catherine come flying in the study . He doubted her feet touched the ground . His fiance followed at a little slower pace in her wheelchair . Both women seemed panicked by something . " You 've got to see this ! " Catherine looked and sounded frantic as she thrust a paperback book at him . " Easy , sweetheart . " Puzzled , he took it from her , then gave it his full attention . To his surprise he discovered it was a romance novel of all things entitled Manhattan Merger , by Bonnie Wrigley . Below the title was a picture of a man holding a woman in his arms . They were standing in the office of a New York City skyscraper where the Manhattan skyline was revealed in the background . Upon a second look he realized it was n't just any office . Or any man ... Even though it was n't a photograph , it was like looking at himself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stunned disbelief . " Promise you wo n't tell mother I 've been reading these , Uncle Payne . The thing is , over the last year I 've noticed that quite a few of the men on the covers resemble you . But this one is you , " Catherine 's voice trembled . " Even his hairline is thesame shape . " He could see that . " She 's right , Payne ! " Diane cried out anxiously . " This man has your build and dark brown hair . It 's the same length . Everything is like you , even to the exact hue of your blue eyes . That 's why I told Catherine she had to show this romance to you . " Both of them had lost color . " He 's even dressed in the same kind of suit and shirt I 've noticed you wear to work before , Uncle Payne ! And that view out of those same kinds of windows is exactly what you see when you walk in your office . The person who did the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look ! " She pointed to some items . " See that picture of a ship passing in front of a lighthouse ? You have a similar picture hanging on your office wall ! And what about that little picture of a bulldog propped on the desk ? " Payne had recognized those details at once , but he had n't wanted to say anything for fear of alarming either of them further . The fact that he 'd hired an architect to incorporate the old lighthouse at Crag 's Head into a home where he 'd been living for the past few years had set off more warning bells . He eyed his fifteen-year-old niece whose hair was the same pale gold as his sister 's . " Have you read this yet ? " " No - As soon as I showed it to Diane , we decided to bring it straight to you ! " " You did the right thing . " Somewhere he 'd heard it said everyone had a look-alike . Possibly more than one . Maybe this was a fantastic coincidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened at Christmas . " Where do you get these books , Catherine ? " " One of the maids reads them first , then gives me a bunch . When I 'm through , I return them to her . " " Which maid ? " " Nyla . " " Catherine really should n't be reading books like this , Payne , " Diane declared . " Whoever is responsible for putting you on the covers probably read a lot of trashy romances at a young age and can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality . " " There 's nothing trashy about them , " Catherine defended quietly . " They 're exciting stories about people falling in love . You learn so much and go so many places . I think they 're wonderful ! If you or mom would ever take the time to read one , you 'd be hooked too . " Diane 's eyes sent him a private message that indicated her strong disapproval . " Listen , Uncle Payne - do n't be angry with Nyla . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who said I ought to bring it to your attention ! " If you say anything to mom and dad about this , they 'll make me stay with grandma and grandpa the next time they take a trip . Nyla might even lose her job . " He shook his head . " I 'm not going to jeopardize her position here . On the contrary , I want to thank Nyla for aiding and abetting you in your latest reading frenzy . It has brought something to light that needs to be dealt with right away . " Diane trembled . " This could be another crazed woman who 's been following you around without your knowledge . There 's no question she 's been in your office , Payne . I 'm afraid for you . " His fiance had every reason to be terrified . Less than six months ago Diane Wylie had taken a stalker 's bullet meant for him and was now condemned to a wheelchair - perhaps permanently . Consumed by guilt , Payne moved around the desk and hunkered down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what to believe at the moment , but if this is another demented wacko , I 'm going to find out . You two stay here . I 'll be back soon . " He stood up , stroked his niece 's pale cheek , then grabbed the romance off the desk and strode out of his brother-in-law 's study . A few minutes later he caught up with Nyla in the kitchen enjoying afternoon tea with some of the other staff . Her expression sobered when he showed her the romance and asked where she 'd bought it . " I get them through a book club , but you can find copies people have already read at the used book store in the village . It 's called Candle Glow Books . They have everything . " " Thank you , Nyla . " " You 're welcome . I might as well tell you , I 've seen your face on other covers , but your hair and eyes were always different . Until this book came in the mail , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggested Catherine say something to you about it . The likeness to you is startling ! So 's the story . " The story too ? Without wasting more time he pulled out his cell phone and called security to meet him around the back of his sister 's house . Since the age of seventeen , Payne had been the victim of half a dozen stalking incidents which had been brought to an end through police intervention . But last December between Christmas and New Year , a psychotic woman had managed to penetrate the Sterling compound on Long Island 's South Fork . Whether she came by water or managed to get past the guard at the gate , no one knew . At the time , the Sterlings were having dinner for the Wylies who 'd invited them to their home for brunch earlier in the day . The Wylies lived on the North Shore of Long Island and had enjoyed this exchange tradition with the Sterlings for many years . Prior to the Christmas holidays Payne had been out of the country a great deal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could catch up on the paperwork in solitude . ( Continues ... )
