" Life Got Sweeter When I Gave Up Sweets " Noma Jewell Bellissemo traded candy and cookies for charity-and lost 120 lb <p> I sat in the restroom , sobbing , " God , please do n't let me lose my job ! " It was 1980 , and the owner of the beauty salon where I worked had just read me the riot act . During the previous year , I 'd gained nearly 60 lb . At 5 ' 2 ' ' , I now tipped the scale at 240 . I was sullen and full of self-loathing , and my attitude and appearance were affecting my work . <p> I was also panicked . I was a 28-year-old high school dropout . If I lost this job , who would hire me ? I had to lose some weight-just enough to turn my attitude around and keep my job . So I made a deal with God : " Help me lose weight , and all the money I save from giving up junk food I 'll donate to charity . " For good measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd spend watching TV , I 'll spend doing volunteer work instead . " The First Step <p> A few days later , my prayer was answered . A client told me about Overeaters Anonymous , a 12-step program with a spiritual and emotional focus that 's designed to help people overcome compulsive eating . The morning after my first meeting , I made my initial life change : I gave up sweets . That may sound like a modest change , but for me it was a titanic shift . For years , my life had revolved around candy , ice cream , and soda . If I awoke in the middle of the night , I 'd eat four or five candy bars . I 'd have one for breakfast . I 'd secretly snack on them in the restroom at work . Lunch , a meal that I would stretch out over the entire afternoon , was fried chicken , biscuits and gravy , mashed potatoes , and apple pie-topped off by more candy . Dinner was a gallon of ice cream . <p> During the first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends from my support group , sometimes in the middle of the night when cravings would strike or from a holiday party where the buffet was laden with treats . I listened to inspirational tapes each morning as I walked for half an hour before work . Through it all , I prayed and meditated . Over the course of 1 year , I shed 30 lb . <p> I knew from experience that gimmicks do n't work , and that if I dropped a lot of weight quickly I 'd just put it all back on . So I was n't discouraged by my slow and steady progress . Making Good on My Promise <p> As the pounds slipped off , I remembered the bargain I 'd made . I gave my candy savings to causes that I believed in , starting with Overeaters Anonymous , then a battered women 's shelter and my church . I began giving my time as well . I counseled women whose self-esteem had been demolished by their weight or by an abusive partner , tutored kids through a literacy program , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had worthwhile gifts to share , and that made me feel better about myself . It also got me moving even more . Instead of having chocolate attacks , I started having volunteer attacks ! ( For a list of volunteer activities that burn calories , see " Lose Weight by Helping Others , " below . ) <p> Although I 'd initially vowed to lose just enough weight to keep my job , after losing about 40 lb , I realized that I wanted to lose more because it felt so good . My life finally held promise . I started paying more attention to my meals-no more fried foods , between-meal snacks , or convenience store dinners . I 'd never cooked before or gone to the grocery store regularly . Now I stocked up on fruits and vegetables as well as fish and chicken , which I would grill or broil . At the same time , I upped my walks to at least 1 hour a day . Gifts I Give Myself <p> As I continued to take the weight off gradually for the next 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each positive step that I took seemed to loosen food 's hold over me . I quit my job , went back to school , earned my high school degree , and enrolled in college courses . In 1987 , I met my future husband through a volleyball league for single people . When we married the following year , I weighed 135 lb and wore a size 10 gown . <p> That 's not to say that there have n't been bumps in the road , but every hardship has presented new opportunities . In 1990 , I lost both of my parents . In my grief , I turned to food for solace and immediately gained 25 lb . Understanding that I was struggling , my husband suggested that I talk to a counselor , who recommended that I explore things I 'd always wanted to do . Encouraged , I began playing the flute , learned to play chess , and took up horseback riding and painting . I also started working in child care . These activities took my mind off food ( I slimmed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The frustrations of my past are now my greatest possession because they help me empathize with others . It 's been 20 years since that fateful day at the salon , but in many ways I feel that my journey is just beginning . So many discoveries lie ahead !
