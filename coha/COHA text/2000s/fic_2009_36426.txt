Las Vegas , Nevada <p> He 'd known all day that something was about to go down , something life-changing and entirely new . The knowledge had prickled in his gut and shivered in the fine hairs on the nape of his neck throughout the marathon poker games played in his favorite seedy , back-street gambling joint . He 'd ignored the subtle mind-buzz as a minor distraction  --  it did n't have the usual elements of actual danger . But now , with a wad of folded bills  --  his winnings  --  shoved into the shaft of his left boot , Dylan Creed knew he 'd better watch it , just the same . <p> Down in Glitter Gulch , there were crowds of people , security goons hired by the megacasinos to make sure their walking ATMs did n't get roughed up or rolled , or both , cops and cameras everywhere . Here , behind the Black Rose Cowboy Bar and Card Room , home of the hard-core poker players who scorned glitz , there was one failing streetlight , an overflowing Dumpster , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his vision , a rat the size of a raccoon . <p> While he loved a good fight , being a Creed , born and bred , Dylan was nobody 's fool . A tire iron to the back of the head and being relieved of the day 's take  --  fifty-odd thousand dollars in cash  --  was not on his to-do list . <p> He walked toward his gleaming red extended-cab Ford pickup with his customary confidence , and probably looked like a hapless rube to anybody who might be lurking behind that Dumpster , or one of the other cars or just in the shadows . <p> Someone was definitely watching him ; he could feel it now , a for-sure kind of thing  --  but it was more annoying than alarming . He 'd learned early in his life , though , just by being Jake Creed 's middle son , that the presence of another person , or persons , charged the atmosphere with a crackle of energy . <p> Just in case , he reached inside his ancient denim jacket , closed his fingers loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his frequent gambling junkets . Garth Brooks might have friends in low places like the Black Rose , but he did n't . Only sore losers , crooks and card sharps hung out in this neighborhood , and Dylan Creed fell into the latter category . <p> He was within six feet of the truck before he realized there was someone sitting in the passenger seat . He debated whether to draw the .45 or his cell phone in the split second it took to recognize Bonnie . <p> Bonnie . His two-year-old daughter stood on the seat , grinning at him through the glass . <p> Dylan sprinted to the driver 's side , scrambled in and lost his hat when the little girl flung herself on him , her arms tight around his neck . <p> With his elbow , Dylan tapped the lock-button on his armrest . <p> " Daddy , " Bonnie said . At least , in his mind the kid 's name was Bonnie  --  Sharlene , her mother , had changed it several times , according to the latest whim . <p> " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little because he was afraid of crushing the munchkin . " Where 's your mom ? " <p> Bonnie drew back to look at him with enormous blue eyes , thick-lashed . Her short blond hair curled in wisps around her ears , and she was wearing beat-up bib overalls , a striped T-shirt and flip-flops for shoes . <p> I 'm only two , her expression seemed to say . How should I know where my mom is ? <p> Dylan turned , keeping one arm around Bonnie , and buzzed down the window . " Sharlene ! " he yelled into the dark parking lot . <p> There was no answer , of course , and he knew by the shift in the vibes he 'd been picking up since he stepped through the back door of the Rose that his onetime girlfriend had bailed . Again . <p> Only this time , she 'd left Bonnie behind . <p> He wanted to swear , even pound the steering wheel once with his fist , but you did n't do things like that with a kid around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixer of a home , like he and his brothers , Logan and Tyler , had , jumping at every thump and bump . And there was more to it than that : besides the fact that he did n't want to scare Bonnie , he felt a strange undercurrent of exhilaration . <p> He seldom saw his daughter , thanks to Sharlene 's gypsy ways  --  though she always managed to cash his child-support checks  --  and being separated from Bonnie , never knowing what was happening to her , ached inside him like a bruise to the soul . <p> Bonnie settled into his lap , laid her head against his chest , gave a shuddery little sigh . Maybe it was relief , maybe it was resignation . <p> She 'd probably had one hell of a day , given how the night was shaping up . <p> Dylan propped his chin on top of her head for a moment , his eyes burning and his throat as hot as if he 'd tried to swallow a red-ended branding iron . He leaned forward , turned the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was his next thought . He had to get to Logan . His brother was a lawyer , after all . And while Dylan had the money to pay any shyster in the country , and he and Logan were sort of on the outs , he knew there was no one else he could trust with something this important . <p> Bonnie was his child , as well as Sharlene 's , and by God , she deserved a stable home , decent clothes  --  the getup she was wearing looked as if it had doubled as a dog bed for a year or two  --  and at least one responsible parent . <p> Not that he was all that responsible . He 'd been a rodeo bum for years , and now he was a poker bum . He had all the money he 'd ever need , thanks to a certain shrewd investment and a spooky tendency to draw a royal flush once in practically every game , and he 'd done some high-paying stunt work for the movies , too . <p> Compared to Sharlene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parent of the Year . <p> He did n't find the note and the shabby duffel bag on the backseat until he got out to South Point , his favorite hotel . Holding a sleepy Bonnie in the curve of one arm while he stood waiting for a valet to take the truck , he read the note . <p> I 'm having some problems , Sharlene had scrawled in her childlike handwriting , slanting so far to the left that it almost lay flat against the lines on the cheap notebook paper , and I ca n't take care of Aurora anymore . Aurora , now ? Jesus , what next  --  Oprah ? I thought giving her to you would be better than putting her in foster care . I went that route , and it sucked . Do n't try to find me . I 've got a boyfriend and we 're hitting the road . Sharlene . <p> Dylan unclamped his back molars , shifted Bonnie 's weight so he could take the ticket from the parking guy and then grab the duffel bag . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he usually crashed when he was passing through Vegas . Madeline would n't like it , but he was n't about to take his two-year-old daughter there . <p> South Point was a sprawling , brightly lit hotel . Dylan stayed there whenever he came to the National Finals Rodeo  --  if Madeline , a flight attendant , was on one of her overseas runs or seeing somebody else at the time  --  and the establishment was family-friendly . <p> He and Bonnie were family . <p> There you had it . <p> After he 'd booked a room with two massive beds , he ordered room-service hamburgers , French fries and milk shakes . While they waited , Bonnie , only half-awake , lay curled on her side on the bed farthest from the door , her right thumb jammed into her mouth , her eyes following every move he made . <p> " You 're gon na be okay , kiddo , " he told her . <p> She looked so small , and so vulnerable , lying there in her ragbag clothes . " Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thumb again , this time with vigor . <p> " That 's right , " Dylan answered , turning from the phone to the duffel bag . Inside were more clothes like the ones she was wearing , a kid-size toothbrush with the bristles worn flat and a naked plastic baby doll with Ubangi hair and blue ink marks on its face . " I 'm your daddy . And it looks like we 'll be doing some shoppin ' in the morning , you and me . " <p> There were no pajamas . No socks . No real shoes , for that matter . Just two more pairs of overalls , two more sad-looking T-shirts , the doll and the toothbrush . <p> Rage simmered midway down Dylan 's gullet . Damn it , what was Sharlene doing with the money he sent to that post office box in Topeka every month ? He knew by the way the substantial check always cleared his bank before the ink was dry that her grandmother picked it up for her , the day it came in , and overnighted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had his suspicions , naturally , regarding Sharlene 's spending habits  --  cocaine , animal-print spandex , tattoos for the fathead boyfriend du jour , if not herself . Bonnie , most likely , had subsisted on fast food and frozen pizza . <p> Dylan 's jaw tightened to the point of pain ; he consciously relaxed it . None of this was Bonnie 's doing . Unlike him , unlike Sharlene , she was innocent , forced to live with the consequences of other people 's mistakes . <p> Not anymore , he vowed silently . <p> Much as he would have liked to put all the blame on Sharlene , he knew it would n't be fair . He 'd known who  --  and what  --  she was when he 'd slept with her , nearly three years ago , after a rodeo , in a town he could n't even remember the name of now . They 'd holed up in a cheap room and had sex for a week , then gone their separate ways . A few clueless months later , Sharlene had tracked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And he 'd known it was true , long before he 'd even laid eyes on Bonnie and seen her resemblance to him , the same way he 'd known he was n't alone in the parking lot behind the Black Rose . <p> Listless with fatigue and probably confusion , Bonnie merely nibbled when the room-service food came , and then fell asleep in her overalls . Was she still on formula or something ? Should he send a bellman into town for baby bottles and milk ? <p> He sighed , shoved a hand through his tangled hair . <p> In the morning , he 'd take Bonnie to a pediatrician  --  after buying her some decent clothes so the doc would n't put a call through to Child Protective Services the minute they walked in  --  for a routine exam and to find out what the hell two-year-olds actually ate . <p> When he was sure Bonnie was sound asleep , the bedspread tucked around her , he called Madeline . She 'd be expecting him , though to her credit , not at an even remotely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement . <p> He needed his clothes , and his shaving gear , and his laptop . <p> " It 's Dylan , " he said , to Madeline 's hello . <p> " You winnin ' , sugar ? " She 'd cultivated a Southern drawl , but every once in a while , the Minnesota came through , with its faintly Scandinavian lilt . <p> " I always do , " Dylan murmured , looking at his sleeping child . <p> " Then we ought to celebrate , " Madeline crooned . " Find us a sexy movie on pay-per-view and  --  " <p> " Look , Madeline , I ca n't make it over there tonight . Something  --  er  --  came up  --  " <p> " Where are you ? " There was a snap in Madeline 's tone now . She was n't possessive  --  he 'd have driven fifty miles out of his way to avoid her if she had been  --  but she had turned down other offers for the duration of his stay in Vegas , she 'd made that abundantly clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm at South Point , " he began . <p> " Damn you , " Madeline said , downright peevish now , " you picked up some  --  some woman , did n't you ? " <p> " Not exactly . " <p> " What do you mean , ' not exactly ' ? " <p> " I 'm with my daughter , Madeline , " Dylan said , patient only because he did n't want to disturb Bonnie . " She 's two years old . " <p> The croon was back . " Oh , bring her over here ! I just love babies . " <p> Dylan actually considered the offer , for a nanosecond . Then he remembered Madeline 's penchant for impromptu sex , the smell of stale pot smoke that permeated her condo and the bowl of colorfully packaged condoms in the middle of her coffee table . <p> " Uh  --  no , " he said . " She 's pretty tired . " <p> He sensed another huff building up beneath Madeline 's drawl . " Then why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a moment , the claws would be out , poised to rip him to bloody shreds . <p> " I need my stuff , " Dylan admitted , ducking his head a little , the way he had on the playground when he was a kid , in anticipation of a blow . " If you 'd just put it all in a cab and send it this way , I 'd be obliged . " <p> " I would n't think of doing that , " Madeline said . " I 'll drop it all off on my way to the club . " Her slight emphasis on the last two words was a clear message  --  if he was going to be a no-show , far be it from her to sit home alone watching pay-per-view . <p> " Madeline , you do n't have to  --  " <p> " South Point ? That 's where you said you are , is n't it ? " <p> " Yes , but  --  " <p> She hung up on him . <p> Dylan sat down on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elbows on his thighs . Madeline would want to come straight up to the room , probably to see if he 'd lied about the company he was keeping , and he did n't want her waking Bonnie . But unless he could talk Madeline into sending his things up with a bellman , which did n't seem likely , he 'd have no other choice . <p> He 'd have to leave Bonnie alone to go downstairs , and that was n't an option . <p> Twenty minutes later , the phone rang , causing Bonnie to stir in the depths of some baby-dream , and he pounced on it , whispered , " Hello ? " <p> " I 'm downstairs , " Madeline said . " What 's your room number , sweetie ? " <p> Dylan suppressed another sigh . God , he hated being called " sweetie . " " Twelve-forty-two , " he said . <p> Madeline , a leggy redhead , almost as tall as he was , at six feet , whisked her shapely self to his door with no measurable delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flanked by a bellman with a loaded cart . Her shiny mouth was tight , and her eyes narrowed slightly . <p> Reluctantly , Dylan admitted her . <p> She immediately scanned the room , her gaze landing on Bonnie , while the bellman waited politely to unload some of the stuff from the cart . Dylan handed him a tip and brought in the laptop , his shaving kit and his suitcase himself . <p> " She is precious ! " Madeline enthused , looming over Bonnie 's bed . <p> " Be quiet , " Dylan said . " She 's had a rough day . " A rough life was more like it . As soon as he got rid of Madeline , he 'd bite the bullet and call Logan . They 'd made some progress lately , he and his older brother , but the ground could get rocky at any time , and asking big brother for help was going to be hard on his pride . <p> Madeline put a shh finger to her plump mouth and batted her false eyelashes . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spangles , a skimpy costume , high heels and fishnet stockings , and Bonnie , if she chanced to wake up and see a stranger standing over her , would have nightmares about showgirls until she died of old age . <p> He took Madeline by the elbow and gave her the bum 's rush toward the door . " Good night , thank you , and what do I owe you for the favor ? " <p> She patted his cheek . " We 'll settle up next time you come through Vegas , " she said . She paused . " The hotel could probably provide a babysitter , then we could  --  " <br> Continues ...
