The road to the market was long and dusty , but at least it was paved . The fresh asphalt was the only extravagance that Leila al-Ghani could find in Mosul in recent days . Her shoes had started to wear out along the length of the road , back and forth on trips from her flat-roofed home in the Wahdah neighborhood . A breeze came skittering down the street , flapping her dress about her legs , and she reached up with a hand to readjust her head scarf . The pins kept it attached to her hair , so her black locks could n't peek out , but as always , wearing the hijab and the long modest dress somehow made Leila more aware of her body , not less . <p> In a way , Leila was grateful for the walk . In Mosul , vehicles were unsafe-they could trigger the explosives , the IEDs , hidden on the roadside , or provoke a burst of gunfire from some idiot bunch of self-appointed mujahideen . At least the horror of antipersonnel land mines had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair triggers that the light weight of a foot would ignite . Regardless , the walk gave her a chance to clear her head . <p> Leila 's father disapproved of these walks-a woman walking alone in Mosul was a transgression of its own . Before the war , she could go wherever she liked and even wear Western-style clothing without fear of reprisal . The family had been secure then , with her father 's job as a judge and Baathist party official and their high standing in the community . Leila had been a princess of one of Mosul 's finest families . <p> Now she wondered how they would all get through this year alive . <p> It was just after ten in the morning , the best time to do the shopping , for all the stalls would be open but the noontime rush had yet to start . It was a chilly day , moving toward the outright cold of the winter months . Mosul was high in elevation , rising on the Levant plains toward the mountains of Kurdistan and Iran . Leila 's corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her corner-was the first to develop agriculture some ten thousand years ago . Now the world thought them uncivilized , barely capable of ruling themselves . <p> Of course , Leila thought , there 's reason to think that . Civilized people do n't blow themselves up every day . <p> The midmorning call to prayer lifted through the air from the loudspeakers atop the minaret tower at the Allah Al-Hasib Mosque , a scant thirty meters away to Leila 's left . It had yet to be blown up , though Leila was glad she was not a man and not beholden to attend mosque , or to pray at certain times of the day . She could pray whenever she wanted-or not at all-and no one would notice . Truth be told , she had stopped praying six months ago when her cousin Inaya had her arms cut off by mujahideen , all because Inaya 's husband had been seen chatting with an American soldier . In an insane world , it seemed impossible to believe in the good presence of Allah . <p> The call to prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . Leila once again adjusted her scarf into place and emerged from the long , asphalt-paved street into the main market area of Mosul . <p> It was a chaotic scene , with motorbikes zipping through with honking horns and goods being off-loaded from trucks and donkeys . Large , colorful billboards advertised soda drinks , mobile phones , and grocery stores ; fresh new promise in a world that seemed dusty dark . Most of it was only that : promise . The sim cards for the mobiles were unreliable , and the grocery stores usually had empty shelves with a few mean little bags of rice or crates of onions . The soda drinks were all right ; Leila was almost addicted to Diet Coke , thanks to her university years in Egypt , and once a week treated herself to a three-hundred-milliliter bottle of it . Not today , however ; today she needed to haul a sack of flour back home , down the sand-edged road . <p> The way was filled with people : men in white robes with their red- or black-checkered kaffiyeh headdresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , jeans and baseball caps ; women in groups of two or three , dressed in modest dark colors with scarves pulled tight about their hair , as Leila 's was . Leila noticed a Western man with a gray mustache bartering with a shopkeeper . This one was a journalist , as Leila had seen him before with his press pass . They had a certain annoying curiosity , that flat blue-eyed " Hi , how are you ? I 'm here to write about your misery " look . Leila did not care for journalists . It was the journalists in the West who brayed about Saddam Hussein 's evilness ; it was the journalists in Iraq who fed the flames of anti-American hatred . Without the constant chatter of the press , Leila thought something might be accomplished . <p> She did not look twice at the gray-mustached American , or his armed , privately hired bodyguards . <p> Instead , Leila went to the Afdhel Baqqal , the " Best Grocer " shop . It was owned by her mother 's cousin Khaled and thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the al-Ghani family . She stepped across the muddy drainage ditch , taking care of her shoes , and ducked inside the low entrance to the store . <p> " Al-salaam alaykum , " Leila said . <p> Khaled , hunched in a lazy posture behind the counter , returned the greeting and asked after her parents . <p> " They are well , " she replied . <p> " Good , good , " said Khaled . " And Fatima ? " <p> Leila smirked . Khaled was engaged to her older sister , Fatima , and had been for five years while he earned enough money to marry . It was set in stone , yet Khaled insisted on acting as though he courted Fatima . " She is also well , " said Leila , occupying herself by inspecting a row of imported goods . " Skippy ... " she read aloud . <p> " Ah ! " Khaled jumped up . " We get this from America . It is called peanut butter . You should try some , I only charge three thousand dinars for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will like it ! " <p> " Maybe next time , " said Leila . She read the rest of the peanut butter label in English . She was proud of her English . At the university in Cairo , classes had been conducted in English and Leila discovered a natural affinity for the language . It was not as expressive as Arabic , but had greater clarity , especially in terms of science and government-and those were subjects that interested Leila . <p> " I hear your cousin on your father 's side is coming to town , " Khaled said . " The doctor . What is his name ? " <p> " Abdul , " said Leila , running her fingers along the clean plastic cases of bottled water . " Or , Abu Mohammed , if you like . " Abdul the doctor was older , thirty-five , and had a son named Mohammed , hence his title of Abu . His wife had died three years ago in childbirth , resulting in the stillbirth of their second son . The man was on the prowl for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leila figured Khaled was worried this other cousin might snatch away his fiancTe . <p> " He is still widowed ? " Khaled persisted . <p> " Yes , " she sighed . " Still widowed . Probably he will marry Fatima . " A look of alarm crossed Khaled 's face , and Leila almost giggled at his expression . " I am not serious ! " she said . " Fatima is intended for you , cousin , and everyone knows it . Do n't worry . " <p> He scowled . " You go too far with your jokes , cousin Leila , " he said . <p> Leila just smiled . " Can I get three kilograms of flour , please ? " she asked . <p> Khaled nodded , but was slow in measuring the flour . He handed the cloth bag to her with a surly glance , which improved a small measure when Leila unfolded her bills to pay him . She thanked him for the flour and settled the large bag into the crook of her arm for the walk home . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was nearly eleven o'clock . It was best to get back ; Father would want his meal prepared , and Mother and Fatima would need help chopping tomatoes . <p> Instead of taking the more direct route , Leila circled the outside of the marketplace once and took a spur road that ran at a diagonal to the shiny black asphalt . It was a peculiarity of hers , never taking the same way coming as going ; a friend at the university had called her obsessive-compulsive . It was difficult to argue in the safe , cloistered environment of Cairo University , but in Mosul this habit felt like prudence , not eccentricity . <p> Her intuition proved itself worthwhile as she came out onto the new paved road . An American convoy roared by just as she stepped out , and Leila waited for them to pass . She held a fascinated dread for the wide-slung American vehicles , with their thick armor and fifty-caliber machine guns swinging about from the top . This group was likely from the American base in Mosul , Forward Operating Base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went fast as they passed by the spur road and Leila averted her eyes from the convoy when it got close . It would not do to be seen gawping at the Americans and making eye contact with strange men . The Quran prohibited gazing between unmarried men and women , and as for gazing between Iraqis and Americans ... Leila could just imagine the trouble . Best to stare at the space in front of her feet as she walked . The growl of the petroleum-fueled engines faded and Leila coughed . The air was tinged with exhaust . <p> As she walked the rest of the way home , her mind turned over the presence of the Americans . They drove with their windows down and popular music blaring , cigarettes dangling from fingertips and eyes concealed behind fashionable reflective sunglasses that wrapped around their heads . They wore electronic gear to excess , looking half machine with wires and antennae sticking up from their helmets . They gave out chocolate bars . Flashing toothy smiles and thumbs-up to every kid they passed by , the Americans seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hostilities " ended ( Leila felt like laughing at that particular declaration , in retrospect ) the soldiers interacted more with the local people , or so her family had told her , but after the Iraqis ' insurgency began , the Americans retreated into their technology . The sooner the Americans left , the better it would be for everyone . Leila did not like trouble . <p> The al-Ghani family 's home was large , with five bedrooms , two sitting rooms , the kitchen , and even a bathroom with a porcelain toilet . Ever since Leila 's older brother , Naji , had moved out to his own place with his wife , it left the house with four inhabitants , all with their own bedroom . It was a luxury for which Leila was grateful . The house was surrounded by high walls , with a metal gate that faced the street . <p> It was this gate Leila slipped through with her package of flour , and she took off her shoes at the front door before going inside . Her flat brown leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the door . Clad now in her stockings , she came into the blue-tiled entrance hall . <p> " Mother ! " she called . " I 'm home ! " <p> " In here , " came the reply . Leila peeked her head inside the kitchen to find a large pot of water boiling on the gas , and a basketful of tomatoes waiting to be chopped . " Ah , there you are , " said Umm Naji . She bustled into the kitchen from the small storage pantry carrying a load of potatoes . " You took a long time . " <p> " No longer than usual , " said Leila . " The market was crowded , and Khaled wanted to talk about Fatima . " <p> Umm Naji 's face glowed at the mention of the betrothal . " Yes , yes , " she said . " I think maybe this is the year they will marry . If all goes well , inshallah . " <p> " If God wills , " Leila echoed . " Shall I peel the potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naji said . She sat her large frame down on a stool in front of the boiling pot , and brought out a knife with which to peel the potatoes . " You chop the fruits , I will do the rest . " <p> Leila sighed . She preferred peeling potatoes . Tomatoes , especially these soft ones , always got away from her in a big mess of seeds . Mother had her ways , though , and it did no good to try and switch jobs around . " I saw an American convoy on our road , " she said . " Going fast . " <p> Umm Naji snorted . " Better not mention it to your father . " <p> " I would n't , " Leila said . She added quietly , " He might tell his friends . " <p> Umm Naji looked up and glared at Leila . " Do n't speak of such things , " she said . " What your father does is his business , and we must not hold opinions about it . " <p> " Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silence followed as Leila chopped tomatoes with a sharp serrated knife . Her father 's political opinion was a sore subject . He clung to the old ways , and spoke more and more longingly of Saddam 's regime , when he had been a party official , and a judge on the local circuit . Now that she was grown up , Leila realized that he must have participated in Saddam 's brutal brand of justice , but she hoped that Tamir al-Ghani had been fair when he could . Besides , those days were over now . At least , everyone had thought them over , until those horrible , insulting pictures came out of the American prison . It made Leila think there was no such thing as a good government . <p> After the Abu Ghraib pictures , her father had started staying out late at night and getting mysterious phone calls , sometimes shuffling odd guests through the house . He became angry . His bad temper simmered around the house . He attended mosque more than ever before , and sometimes the imam came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation from a hiding place behind the wall where there was a loose brick . She heard talk of insurgency , of the noble cause of al-Qaeda in Iraq , of something called Ansar al-Sunna , of using cell phones in dangerous ways , of how the Americans might be hurt . She heard her father grumble about the occupation and the lies of the West . The imam always spoke of the Quran , quoting the hadith , the sayings of the Prophet , and advocating a return to strict Muslim law . When they were together , the men 's voices grew louder and angrier , and Leila heard more of " the new Crusade " and the " final battle against the Western invaders . " <p> Leila twisted her mouth , focusing on chopping the last of the tomatoes . She did not believe in such anger ; all she wanted was to be free , open , fashionable . She hated the way Father had become since the Americans arrived . It was like walking on eggshells with him , and where Leila had once enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He was hard and strict and bitter . <p> " Get the oven going , Leila , " her mother said . " I 'll make the dough for the bread . " <p> Leila nodded . <p> " Tomorrow we 'll start making the delicacies for Abdul 's visit , " said Umm Naji with a new lift in her voice . " We 're all looking forward to that . " <p> Leila made a noncommittal noise in her throat . She was not looking forward to cousin Abdul 's visit . Ever since Fatima had let slip that Leila wanted to go to postgraduate school to study medicine , Abdul spoke to Leila in patronizing tones and kept hinting that he could teach her about being a doctor . <p> " It 's too bad about Abdul , " Umm Naji said . Her eyes darted over to Leila . " He still ... needs a wife . " <p> Leila raised an eyebrow . " Not again , Mama . " <p> " I am just making a suggestion , " Umm Naji said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married sometime . It will be shame for our family if a beautiful girl like you can not find a husband . " <p> " If I married Abdul , " Leila said , " I would never get to be a doctor . I would have to take care of a five-year-old who was n't even mine , and probably have more babies , besides . It 's not modern . " <p> " Modern . Bah , " said Umm Naji . " In times like these , we need what works . You are a little girl , Leila . You have no understanding of these things- " <p> " First I 'm an old woman at twenty-three , now I 'm a little girl . Make up your mind , Mother , " Leila snapped . <p> " Shhh ! " Umm Naji gestured toward the kitchen door . <p> Leila turned to see her father filling the door frame . She stood straighter . " Baba ! " she said . <p> " When is lunch ready ? I have brought guests , " Tamir said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The bread will take only thirty minutes . " <p> He nodded , turning away to go back to the men 's sitting room . <p> " Guests , always guests , " said Umm Naji when he was out of earshot . " That man is more popular now than when he was a judge ! " <p> " I think these are a different sort of guests , Mama , " said Leila . " Where is Fatima ? " <p> " She had to work this morning , " said Umm Naji . Leila 's sister Fatima , elder by two years , worked at a local kindergarten as a child-minder . In days past , it would have been unnecessary for an al-Ghani daughter to work , but with Tamir out of a steady job they needed more income to keep up the house . Leila herself was looking for a job in the local hospital in Mosul ; one of the nurses said she might be able to start as a medical technician . " Fatima will be home any minute , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door open and her sister 's light footsteps enter the house . " Hello , " Fatima said , coming into the kitchen . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
