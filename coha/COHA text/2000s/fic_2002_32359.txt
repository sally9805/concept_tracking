Dark Guardian By Christine Feehan Dorchester Publishing Christine Feehan ( Dark Guardian ) Chapter One Jaxon Montgomery snapped the clip into her handgun and glared at her partner . " This is a setup , Barry , I can smell it . It 's amazing to me that you do n't have a clue . Where 's your sixth sense ? I thought men were supposed to have some kind of instinct for self-preservation . " Barry Radcliff snorted derisively . " You 're the one leading the party , honey . We 're all following you . " " My point , partner , is that you have no sense of self-preservation , " Jaxx threw him a teasing grin over her shoulder . " The entire lot of you is worthless . " " You 've got to decide , Jaxx , do we try it or call it off ? " Jaxx closed off her mind to everything , the darkness of the night , the biting cold , the adrenaline surging in her blood needing action . The warehouse was too easily accessible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing themselves . Everything in her screamed they were walking into an ambush . Without hesitation she moved her mouth over the tiny radio . " Abort , guys . I want all of you to pull back and out . Signal when clear . Barry and I will cover until we hear from you . Go now . " The tiny receiver in her ear crackled . " Are you going to let a woman losing her nerve cost us the biggest bust in history ? " That was the new guy . The one whohad been placed on her team against her will . The one who had some kind of political pull in the department and was on his way up . Benton . Craig Benton . " Stand down , Benton , that 's an order . We can argue over it later , " Jaxx commanded , but she knew , with a sinking heart , he was the cause of the warning systems shrieking at her . Benton wanted to be a hero . There was no room for heroes in her line of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid . He knew it as well as she did . Barry had been her partner long enough to know when Jaxx said there was trouble , there was hell out there . " He 's going in , he 's going in . I see him at the side door . " " Fall back , Barry , " Jaxx snapped , already moving forward . " I 'll try to pull him out , you get the rest of the world down here because there 's going to be a war . Keep our guys out of there until we have help . It 's an ambush . " She was so small and slender , dressed in her dark clothes and cap . Barry could barely make her out in the darkness of the night . She never made a sound when she moved . It was eerie . He found himself continually glancing at her to assure himself she was with him . Now , he moved too . There was no way his partner was going into that building without him . He issued the orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told himself it had nothing to do with Jaxx Montgomery and everything to do with partnership . It had nothing to do with love , and everything to do with the job . " You should see this place , " the radio crackled in their ears . " Get in here . It 's loaded with enough chemicals to blow up half the city . " " You idiot , it 's loaded with enough chemicals to blow up the building with you in it , now get the hell out of there . " It was Jaxx at her best . Her voice was soft and cutting , a whip of pure contempt . Anyone hearing that voice became a believer . Craig Benton glanced uneasily to his right and then his left . The place suddenly gave him the creeps . He began a slow retreat , backing toward the door . At once something bit at his leg , high and ugly , knocking him backwards and down . He found himself on cold cement floor staring up at the loft . The place remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg and found a mush of raw hamburger . He screamed . " I 'm hit , I 'm hit ! Oh , God , I 'm hit . " Jaxon would have gone through the door first , but Barry slammed his shoulder into her , knocking her slight figure to the side . He dove into the warehouse , rolling to his right looking for cover of any kind . He heard the whine of the bullets as they zipped past him and embedded into the crate behind him . He thought he got off a warning to Jaxx , but he could n't be sure as he crawled toward Benton . Things were happening too fast , and his vision had narrowed toward his purpose , pulling out the stupid kid and getting the hell out of there . He made it to the kid . " Shut up , " he snapped rudely . Did the rookie have to be as big as a linebacker ? Dragging him out of there was going to be difficult and if Craig kept screaming he was going to shoot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught Benton under the arms , tried to stay low and behind cover and began to make his way back toward the door . It was a long way . They were spraying the area now and deliberately sweeping the chemicals so explosions were going off all over the place . Fires broke out . He felt the sting of the first hit on his scalp ; the second shot was well placed . His left arm went numb and he dropped Benton and found himself on the floor . Jaxx was there . Jaxon Montgomery , his partner . Jaxon never stopped until it was over , and she never left her partner in trouble . Jaxon was going to die in that warehouse right beside of him . She was providing covering fire , running toward them . " Get up , you lazy ass , you 're not that hurt . Haul your butt out of here . " Yeah , that was his Jaxx , always sympathetic to his problems . Benton , damn him , was dragging his body toward the door , trying to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke and heat did n't help . Something was wrong with his head , so that it pounded and throbbed and everything seemed hazy and far away . Jaxx 's small frame landed beside him , her beautiful eyes enormous with worry . " You landed us in a hell of a mess , my friend , " she said softly . " Get moving . " She gave him that quick once over , assessing the damage and dismissing it for more important things . " I mean it , Barry , move your butt out of here now ! " It was a clear command . Jaxx slammed another clip into her gun and rolled away from him to draw fire away from her partner , coming up on her knees firing up toward the loft . As he dragged his leaden body toward the entrance , Barry caught a glimpse of a man falling . Satisfaction was instant . Jaxx was an expert marksperson . Whatever she shot at went down . Even if they died here , they took at least one of them with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets struck Jaxx , taking her small body and flinging it across the warehouse backward several feet . She fell like a rag doll onto the floor , a dark stain spreading out around her . Furious , enraged , Barry tried to bring his gun up , but his arm refused to respond . The only thing he could do was crawl forward or crawl back . He crawled back , dragging his body across the distance to hers . She was just laying there . She turned her head slightly to get a look at him . " Do n't , Jaxx , do n't you do this to me . " " Get out of here . " " I mean it , damn it , do n't you do this . " He was desperate to reach her , motivate her to move . She had to move . Had to get out with him . " I 'm tired , Barry . I 've been tired for a very long time . Someone else can save everybody now . " She murmured the words very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Barry tried to gather her in his arms , but his arms would n't work . To his left , the small door suddenly slammed shut , trapping them inside . Benton was right : There were enough chemicals in there to blow them all over the city . He waited , expecting death at any moment . He heard screams then , horrible , gut-wrenching screams of fear . He saw bodies falling through the smoke and the glow of flames . He saw things that could n't be . A wolf , huge and savage , leaping at a fleeing man , powerful jaws boring through the chest to get at the heart . The wolf seemed to be everywhere , bringing down man after man , ripping through tissue and flesh , cracking bones with its jaws . He saw that same wolf contort , shift shape so that it was a huge owl that dove at another man , plucking the eyes right out of the head . It was an unbelievable nightmare of blood and death and retribution . Barry had no idea he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images . He knew at least two bullets had hit him . He could feel the blood trickling down his face as well as his arm . Obviously he was hallucinating . That was why he did n't attempt to shoot when the wolf finally made its way to their corner of the warehouse . He watched it approach , admiring the way it moved , its muscles rippling , the way it leapt so easily over anything in its path . It came straight to him , drawn no doubt by the smell of blood , or so Barry thought , his own vivid imagination running wild . The wolf looked into his eyes a long time . The eyes of the wolf were very strange , almost black , completely black . Intelligent eyes . Empty of any emotion . Barry felt no threat , but more as if the wolf were staring into his very soul , perhaps judging him . He lay there still , feeling only a willingness to do whatever the creature wanted him to do . He felt very sleepy , his eyelids far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , he could have sworn the wolf contorted once more and began to take on the shape of a man . * * * Jaxon Montgomery woke to the sound of a heart beating . It was beating fast and hard , frightened , and very , very loud . She felt automatically for her gun . She was never without a weapon , yet she found nothing under her pillow or beside her body . The heart pounded even harder , and she tasted the coppery flavor of fear in her mouth . Dragging in a lungful of air , she forced herself to open her eyes . She could only stare in astonishment at the room she was in . It was no hospital and certainly not the bedroom in her tiny apartment . It was beautiful . The walls were a soft mauve , so light it was impossible to tell if the color was really there or merely her imagination . The carpet was thick and a deeper mauve , picking up the colors in the stained glass that etched the room , high up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gave Jaxx the illusion of being safe , something she knew was impossible . Just to make certain she was really awake , she dug her fingernails into her palm . She turned her head to examine the contents of the room . The furniture was antique and heavy , the bed a four-poster more comfortable than anything she had ever slept on in her life . The dresser was large and held a few feminine articles on it . A brush , a small music box and a candle . They were beautiful and looked antique . There were several candles in the room , all lit so that the room seemed to bask in the soft light . She had often dreamed of a room like this , so beautiful and elegant , with stained glass windows . It occurred to her again that she might not be awake . The sound of the heart pounding so loud convinced her she was wide awake and there must be others taking care of her . Others who had no way of knowing the danger she brought with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jaxx looked around frantically for her gun . She had definitely suffered an injury . It dawned on her then that she could n't move very well . She took an inventory , carefully trying to move her arms and then her legs . Her body did not want to respond . She could move if she concentrated every bit of her determination , but it was hardly worth the effort . She was very tired and her head was aching . The relentless beating of that heart was driving her crazy . A shadow fell across the bed , and her heart slammed hard enough to cause her pain and she realized the sound had come from her own chest . Jaxon slowly turned her head . A man was standing over her . Very tall , powerful . A predator . She saw that instantly . She had seen many predators , but this one was the ultimate . There was something in his complete stillness . A waiting . A confidence . It was in the very stillness itself . A power . A danger . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know how she knew these things , but she did . He believed himself invincible , and she had a sneaking suspicion that he just might be . He was neither old nor young . It was impossible to tell his true age . His eyes were old . Black and emotionless . Empty eyes . His mouth was very sensual , erotic really , his teeth very white . He was handsome and sexy . More than sexy . Completely hot . Jaxx sighed and tried not to panic . Tried not to allow her thoughts to show on her face . His shoulders were very wide . He definitely did n't look like a doctor . He did not look like someone she could take down easily in hand-to-hand combat . He smiled then , amusement touching his eyes for just one moment . It made him look completely different . Warm . Sexy . Even sexier . She had a feeling he was reading her thoughts and laughing at her . Her hand was moving restlessly beneath the covers , forever seeking the gun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . His voice was beautiful . Smooth like velvet , almost seductive . He had a strange accent she could n't place and a way of turning his words that sounded very Old World , almost alluring . Jaxon blinked rapidly in an attempt to cover her confusion , surprised by the direction her thoughts were taking . She never thought in terms of sex . She had no idea why she was equating this stranger with erotic descriptions . " I need my gun . " It was a dare of sorts , a test of his reactions . Those black eyes studied her face intently . His scrutiny made her uncomfortable . Those eyes saw too much , and Jaxon had a great deal to hide . His face was expressionless , giving nothing away , and Jaxx was very good at reading people . " Are you planning to shoot me ? " He asked it with that same gentle voice , only this time there was a hint of amusement in it . She was very tired . It was becoming a struggle to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her heart had slowed to match the exact rhythm of his . Exactly . The two hearts were beating simultaneously . She could hear their hearts . His voice was very familiar to her , yet he was a total stranger . No one could ever meet such a man and forget him . She could not possibly know this man . She moistened her lips . She was incredibly thirsty . " I need my gun . " He moved to the dresser . Not walked . Glided . She could watch him move like that for all time . His body was like that of an animal , a wolf or a leopard , something catlike and powerful . Fluid . Totally silent . He flowed , yet when movement ceased , he was completely still again . He handed her the gun . It felt familiar in her hand , an extension of herself . Almost at once some of the fear faded away . " What happened to me ? " Automatically she tried to check the clip , but her arms felt like lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job . He took the gun back , his fingers brushing her skin . The flood of warmth was so unexpected she jerked away from him . He did n't react , but gently pried her fingers loose and showed her the full clip with a round in the chamber before returning the gun to her palm . " You were shot several times , Jaxon . You are still very ill . " " This is n't a hospital . " She was always suspicious ; it was what kept her alive . She did n't want to be alive anymore . She was n't supposed to be alive . " You 're in great danger . You ca n't stay here with me . " She tried to warn him , but her words were too low , her voice fading . " Sleep , honey . Just go back to sleep . " He said it softly , yet his velvet tone seeped into her body and mind , as powerful as any drug . He touched her then , stroking back her hair . His touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had a right to touch her . It was more of a caress than anything else . Jaxon was very confused . She knew him . He was a part of her . She knew him intimately , yet he was a total stranger . She sighed , unable to prevent her lashes from drifting down and giving in to the powerful demand that she sleep . Lucian sat on the edge of the bed and simply watched her sleeping . She was the most unexpected thing he had experienced in all of his many centuries of living . He had waited nearly two thousand years for this being , and she was nothing like he 'd envisioned . The women of his race were tall and elegant with an abundance of dark hair and eyes . They were creatures of power and skill . He was well aware that his species was on the edge of extinction and their women were guarded as the treasures they were , but still , they were powerful , not fragile and vulnerable like this young woman .
