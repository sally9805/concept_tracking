The ultimate measure of any Chief Justice 's service is fidelity to the Constitution . By that standard , Rehnquist has earned very high marks . During his tenure as chief , Rehnquist has led the Supreme Court toward restoring the Founders ' vision . The Constitution protects society from excessive political power emanating from the Capitol , but for the previous 60 years , the court had often ignored this blueprint , promoting centralization of power at the expense of a decentralized civic order emanating from the states . Rehnquist reversed that trend . <P> His court also helped revive civil society by permitting religious values to compete equally with secular ones . The First Amendment 's Establishment Clause was designed not to put religion at a disadvantage , as the court had recently interpreted it , but merely to prevent government from promoting religion . Prohibiting aid to religious schools forces parents to pay once for the public school that does not reflect their values and once for a school that does . But last term Rehnquist correctly held that parents should be able to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secular school . This decision does more in a practical way for religious freedom than the court has ever done before . <P> The Rehnquist court has also restored power to citizens by protecting the right of civic organizations to express themselves . The court upheld the Boy Scouts ' right to exclude homosexual leaders whose presence would dilute the Scout message that homosexuality was immoral . We should see this not as an attack on homosexuals but as a vindication of First Amendment rights of organizations to form a message through their associations . The Scout message may be flat wrong , but it should lose through societal debate , not government fiat . <P> Because of William Rehnquist , the court has largely regarded the Constitution as law rather than as a mirror of the Justices ' own desires . Supreme Court Justices are our servants when they are servants of the law , because we the people have made the law , not least the Constitution .  --  By John O.
