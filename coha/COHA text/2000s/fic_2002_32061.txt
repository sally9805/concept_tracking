I put off calling Ace Buffington for a couple of days , but some , perhaps misguided , sense of obligation or loyalty finally makes me give in . We agreed to meet at a pub called the Boar 's Head just off Shaftesbury Avenue , near the London theater district . It 's noisy and smoky inside , loud voices , bodies shouldering up to the bar for that one last drink before curtain time , and Ace is easy to spot . He towers over everyone , waving money to get the bartender 's attention . " Wow , " Ace says as I come up . " Busy here . I 'll get the drinks . See if you can find a table , then we 'll drink to our collaboration . Beer okay ? " " Sure . " I try to catch his eye . " It 's not going to happen , Ace . " He looks at me , feigns puzzlement . " What ? " " Whatever it is you 're going to try and sell me . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steeling myself to ward off Ace 's enthusiasm , persuasiveness , and persistence . He 's done it before . " Hey , c'm on , Evan . At least hear me out . " He waves again at the bartender . " Wo n't make any difference , Ace . You 'd be wasting your time , I 'm afraid to even ask why you 're in London . " The spring semester is n't over yet . Ace should be at UNLV , lecturing coeds on American literature and correcting final exams , not meeting me in a London pub . " Sabbatial , " Ace says . " I was eligible and jumped at the chance , especially when this other thing came up . " I shake my head and smile in spite of myself . " I 'll find a table . " I turn from the bar and spot some people getting up , putting on coats . I get there just ahead of three guys , claim the table , and wait for him to join me . I met Ace Burlington on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing and conducting for Lonnie Cole . Ace is a big , friendly guy who is crazy about two things : jazz and tennis . A professor of English at UNLV , he also has a passion for collecting old records , and a knowledge of jazz history that reflects his love for the music and impressed me . When his wife Janey died suddenly of cancer , he threw himself into work . But even department politics , which he describes as worse and more vicious than any crime family , were n't enough to fill the lonely hours . Ace got it in his head to do an article on Las Vegas , and that 's what got me into trouble the first time . Until me , jazz musicians had simply been names he 'd read about or listened to , but he wanted to get inside . Ace loves having a jazz musician friend , but sometimes he goes overboard , which is why musicians often keep people at a certain distance . Civilians , we call them . No matter how much they 're into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the bandstand and a seat at a front table . I suppose it 's true of any profession . Talking , communicating , with a colleague is different than with an outsider . There 's so much that does n't need explaining . No matter how hard someone like Ace triesand he does tryhe still ca n't quite understand what goes on in your mind when you 're on the bandstand . How it feels , what you 're thinking . Still , Ace has been a good friend . It 's his overzealousness that gets me in trouble . He decided to write an article on the Moulin Rouge , the first interracial casino in Las Vegas , and more pointedly , somehow explain the death of saxophonist Wardell Gray . He enlisted me to help with the research and talk with musicians , and since he 'd got me my first gig after the accident , I felt obligated , so I agreed . What I did n't know was that I 'd uncover a mess from the past , butt heads with a minor Mafia figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me into trouble too , when he hired me to authenticate some supposedly lost recordings of trumpeter Clifford Brown . That time it was a looney-tune collector , and I found out how serious those can be . I vowed then that would be the last time . But Ace finding me in London meant he was up to something again , and he was going to try and drag me into it . Not this time . I could n't afford any more misadventures , and I still had Los Angeles on my mind , although Ace had had nothing to do with that . But what had happened in Los Angeles was part of the reason I was in London . My chops were back , I was recording again , Natalie and I were very serious , everything was going fineuntil a crazed woman , bent on getting vengeance for her brother 's rejection by the jazz world , started knocking off smooth jazz artists . She left a trail of clues the FBI could n't figure out until I was brought in to help my high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control into a psychological duel between her and me , a nightmare that has left me with a hollow feeling inside . Enough so that I want to escape for a while and decompress in Europe . Ace is n't going to get me this time , but I know he will try . He jostles his way through the crowd and sets down two glasses of lager with a firm hand . He settles himself on one of the upholstered stools and takes a long drink . " What other thing , Ace ? " He winks at me and pauses to take a big gulp of beer . " Ah , worth waiting for , " he says . He sets the glass down and gives me his full attention . " A bona fide book deal , a tentative contract , just one minor thing to firm it up . " Ace 's eyes light up with enthusiasm as he explains . I 've seen this look before . " Who 's the one jazz musician who has been written about more , has more recordings , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about today ? " I light a cigarette , relieved that English pubs are not as hard on smokers as California bars . " Miles Davis . " Keep this low-key , I think , so Ace does n't get too excited . " Close . Right instrument , wrong guy . " I shrug . " Okay , tell me . " " C'm on , Evan . " He leans closer . " There 's even a whiff of a movie deal . He 's been compared to James Dean . You know , tragic life , sometimes brilliant career , and ... mysterious death . " He looks disappointed when I wo n't play the game . He holds up his hands . " Chet Baker , of course . " " Of course . A movie deal ? " " Yeah , couple of big-time actors are vying for the rights . Over ten years since he died , and he 's still being talked about . " I can see Ace is only getting warmed up . I 'm beginning to feel like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , so you 've gotten a tentative contract for a Chet Baker book . Congratulations , I 'm happy for you . " But Ace does n't sound happy . There 's something in his voice , some air of desperation about him , as if he just has to make this sale or he loses the commission . " It 's fate , Evan , fate . Turning on the radio , catching you on the show the other night . We 're both in London . Did you know that Chet Baker died just a couple of hours ' flight from here , in Amsterdam , and here you are in London , maybe going to Amsterdam yourself . It 's meant to be . " I had told him about the possibility briefly on the phone . " The Amsterdam gig is tentative . " I look at Ace steadily . " And no , Ace , it 's not meant to be , not this time . " His pained expression makes me pause . Ace was responsible in no small way for getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , the books are balanced . Ace puts down his beer and takes a breath , as if now he 's going to tell me the truth . " Okay , I wo n't lie to you . The book deal is tentative because I promised them you 'd be coauthor . " He ca n't meet my eyes . He takes another drink of his beer . " There , it 's out . " For a moment I stare at him , speechless . " Why , Ace ? You did n't even talk to me about it . " I try to hold my anger in check , but it 's getting difficult . " " I know , I know . It 's just ... Evan , look , I really need this . If I 'm finally going to get a full professorship , I need another book . I 've made some enemies , but I want to run that damn department , politics or not . With you on board , the contract is a sure thing , then ... " He lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implication that if I do n't help him , I 'm responsible for his not getting promoted . I sigh and look around the pub . It 's less noisy now as it begins to empty out . People are gathering up their coats , saying good-byes . " I already told you , Ace . It 's not going to happen . " " Evan , we were partners , remember ? We worked well together . Look what we did with Wardell Gray . Almost solved a forty-year-old murder . And what about Clifford Brown , those lost tapes ? You proved they were phony . I could n't have done that by myself . I need you on this , Evan . " His voice drops lower . " I really need this , Evan . I would n't ask otherwise . " " Stop it , Ace . Nobody said it was your fault , but those things got me way in over my head . Are you forgetting I almost got killed a couple of times ? No , I 'm through with that , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't any part of that . " " I did n't say you were . " He looks away for a moment . " She got sentenced , you know . Life without parole . " He takes a drink of his beer and looks at me , quickly realizing he should change the subject . " Have you heard from Natalie ? " Once I was out of it , I had n't followed the case . " No , but I did n't expect to . I have n't contacted her , either . " Ace shakes his head . " Well , I 'm not going to go there either . " He leans forward , revs up again . " But this is different . Chet Baker is a completely other thing . " " Really ? You know that for a fact ? For all we know there are people who would prefer keeping his death just the way it apparently wasan accident . And as far as anyone knows , it was an accident . " Even in the noisy pub , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a nearby table turns to look at us . " Ace , I 'm sorry , man , I really am , but I have to pass on this one . I ca n't do it . You 're on your own . " Ace smiles weakly and shrugs , and his tone changes to quiet acceptance . " Well , hey , I had to try , did n't I ? No hard feelings ? " " No , " I say , but that 's a mistake . His tone changes once again . I 've never seen him like this . He wo n't look at me . " What do I have to do , Evan ? I do n't think you understand . I need this to happen . " " Ace , do n't do this . I know it 's important , but I ca n't do it . " He nods silently , does n't say anything for a couple of minutes . I do n't know what more to say , but I know it is n't going to be yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , " he says finally . " I understand . I just got carried away . The editor seemed just on the edge . " He sits up straighter , manages a show of false cheerfulness , but comes off as disingenuous . " Do n't worry , I 'll manage . I 'll just have to do such great research they 'll give me a book contract anyway . But did I mention you 'd have credit ? Your name would be right there on the book . I mean , I do n't expect you to do this anonymously . I " " Ace . " He puts up his hands . " Okay , okay . I'l stop . " He looks at his watch . " Hey , you better get going . Opening night , huh ? Wish I could stick around to hear you , but I 've got some things to do . " A gap of uncomfortable silence descends upon us that even the pub noise ca n't drown out . I feel like I have to say something . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chet Baker . If you 're going to Amsterdam , you can talk to some musicians , maybe the police " " I know how to do research , " Ace says . The silence falls over us again . Finally I have to break it . " Well , I should go . " " Sure , " Ace says . " Well , listen , if the Amsterdam gig works out , promise me we 'll get together , have a beer or something . " He digs in his pocket for paper and pen . " Here , " he says . " This is where I 'll be staying . " He writes down a name and number and hands it to me . " Let me know if you 're coming . " " Sure , Ace , of course . " I stuff the paper in my pocket and stand up to go . " Good luck with everything . " The crowd has thinned considerably as I make my way to the door . I turn back once , toward Ace , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . Then I walk out . Soho is back behind Shaftesbury Avenue . I wind through the noisy little crowded streets , filled with pubs , sex shops , Indian , Chinese , and Greek restaurants with lamb roasting on spits in the window , tobacconists , and the occasional fish-and-chips shop . My mind , though , is still on Ace 's proposal and Gillian Payne . She had killed three people and almost killed her brother . The FBI made me her contact after she promised to stop the killing if I agreed to help her find her brother . I found him , but it cost me a lot , mainly my relationship with Natalie . What was she doing now ? Ace 's mention of her brought memories of our times together flooding back . Across from Ronnie Scott 's I stop and grab a coffee and a cigarette , enjoying this last moment of anonymity before I walk across the street . It feels good to see my name on the marquee of one of the oldest established jazz clubs in Europe . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to think about anything else but music . Not Ace , not Gillian , just music . Inside the club , there 's a fair crowd already . I walk past the bar to the back room behind the stage . The grand piano awaiting me is flanked by a bass and drum set . The seating is slightly tiered , arranged in a half circle facing the stage . Somebody points at me , and I hear a voice say , " I think that 's him . " Backstage , Pete King , the burley Cockney manager of the club , is talking with the bassist and drummer . " Evan , " King says . " All right then ? These lads are ready to go . " He jerks his thumb at Gordon and Derek , the bassist and drummer . " Hi , Pete , hi , guys . " We 'd only had time for a short afternoon rehearsal . They were both good , and I knew everything would be okay if I stuck to standards , a couple of blues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber pad . Gordon nods and smiles . Pete looks around . " Well , all right then , shall we ? " We all file onstage and take our places as the lights come up while Pete makes the opening announcement . " Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . It 's our pleasure , and I 'm sure it will be yours , to meet pianist Evan Horne . He 's American , but we wo n't hold that against him . " Pete pauses , taps the microphone , waits for the polite chuckles that follow . I catch Gordon rolling his eyes . " Hmm , " Pete says . He glances at me and shrugs . " Ronnie always did that better . Anyway , with Evan are our own Gordon Powell and Derek Runswick . " I begin with " Alone Together , " medium tempo . Gordon and Derek follow easily , and by the second chorus we hit a comfortable groove . My hand feels good and relaxed , the piano is in tune , and I realize I 'm in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it can be hit-and-miss with pickup rhythm sections , nothing like your own group . They 're not Gene Sherman or Jeff Lasorda , but these two have backed plenty of American visitors and both are good players . I play another couple of choruses , then give it to Derek for his solo . I nod at Gordon , and we play some eight-bar exchanges , then take it home . A couple of ballads , an up blues , and I end the set with " Just Friends . " First tunes , first set , butterflies gone , and the three of us know each other a little now . The audience is with us , and the applause is genuine as we take a break . " Hey , nice guys , " I say to Gordon and Derek . " Let me buy you a drink . " I catch the waitress and order for the three of us . " Two whiskeys neat also , please , " a familiar voice behind me says . I turn and find Colin Mansfield and another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come and join us . This is Mike Bailey with the Daily Telegraph . " " Hi , Colin . Did n't expect you so soon . " I shake hands with Bailey . He 's a short , stocky man in a rumpled suit and knit tie . " Always like to catch an opening night , " Mansfield says . " Mike would like to do a piece on you for the arts section if you have time . " " Well , sure , I guess so . " " Do n't worry , " Bailey says with a quick , reassuring smile . " It wo n't hurt much . " " We can go in the back if you want . I 've got about a half hour before the next set . " " Suits me , " Bailey says . " Good , I 'll get our drinks sent back , " Mansfield offers . He goes off to find our waitress . Bailey and I head for the backstage dressing room . He takes out a pad and pen from his bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has filled me in on your background . This will be short , but I 'd like to try and get it in tomorrow 's paper . I understand you have a new recording coming out . " " Yes , that 's right . Quarter Tone Records . Small label in Los Angeles . We recorded it just before I came over . I do n't think there 's a release date yet , but I have n't been in touch with them for a while . " Bailey looks up . " Hiding out in Europe ? " Something in his tone bothers me , but maybe I 'm being too sensitive . I 've been burned by the press beforemisquotes , misinterpretation , and sometimes they just make up things . " No , just getting away from the fray for a while . " Bailey nods and scribbles on his pad . There are some more questions about music , my playing , and how I like Ronnie Scott 's . Then he shifts gears . " I imagine that episode with the serial killer in Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering where this is going , but I ca n't seem to escape it . " Well , it was n't fun , I guarantee you . " " No , I 'm sure , " Bailey says . Colin joins us then , followed by the waitress with our drinks . " Well , cheers then , " Mansfield says , raising his glass , and we all drink . " What are your plans after Ronnie 's ? " Bailey asks . " Well , they 're pretty sketchy . There 's a possibility of a gig in Amsterdam , then we 'll just see what happens from there . " " So you might stay in Europe for a while , then ? " " Possibly . Like I say , I 'll just have to see what happens . I like to play it by ear . " Mansfield and Bailey exchange glances , then Bailey continues . He glances briefly again at Mansfield , and some kind of signal passes between them . " Was n't Amsterdam where Chet Baker died ? " " So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going there . " " No , of course not , " Mansfield says . Bailey nods . His smile seems more like a smirk to me . He makes a few more notes , then closes his notebook . " Well , I guess I 've got enough . Thanks for your time . " " No problem . Are you staying around for another set ? " I ask Mansfield . " No , I 'm afraid not . I have to be up early . " " And I have a deadline , " Bailey says , getting to his feet . " I enjoyed your music . " " Thanks . " I walk them out . We shake hands again , and I watch them disappear toward the front door . Derek and Gordon are leaning on the bar , drinking beers . " Mike Bailey , was n't it ? " Derek asks . " Yeah . You know him ? " " Fucking wanker , " Powell says and downs his beer . Derek smiles . " He thought Gordon played too loud for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws up his face and spits out the words like they 're something that tastes bad . " Powell 's obtrusive drumming lent little to the evening 's performance . What the fuck does he know ? He 's a critic . " Derek winks at me . " Gordon 's very sensitive . " " Hey , that 's a good quality in a drummer . " " See , " Gordon says . " I told you . " I get a signal from Pete King then . It 's time for the second set . This one gets even better . Derek 's lines are just right , and Gordon 's cymbal sizzles underneath me throughout the set . My only regret is that I know that , just when we 're really meshing , the gig will be over and I 'll be on to someplace else . I 'm staying at a small hotel in Bloomsbury , arranged for by Pete King . The room is so small I can hardly turn around , but it 's clean and comfortable and includes breakfast . Over bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , looking for the arts section . Mike Bailey was a fast writer . The best thing about the piece is that there 's no accompanying photo . JAZZ PIANIST DETECTIVE FINDS PEACE AND QUIET IN LONDON American pianist Evan Horne opened to a respectable crowd at Ronnie Scott 's last night , but most of the patrons probably were n't aware they were listening to a sometime private investigator whose last assignment was to help the FBI catch a serial killer in Los Angeles . I hate to even read the rest of the article . Bailey has dug up all the details and implies that I might be heading to Amsterdam to investigate Chet Baker 's death . He makes playing piano seem a sideline , the music secondary . I try to get angry , but I 'm beginning to realize stories like this one are something I ca n't escape , perhaps ever . There 's nothing inaccurate , it 's just the slant he takes . Bailey ends on a brief , albeit positive note . Horne 's playing was a pleasant surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years ago , and his rendition of standards , particularly ballads , is reminiscent of a muscular Bill Evans . Horne is at Ronnie Scott 's through Saturday . I finish breakfast and go for a walk , thinking about Bailey 's story and wondering how much Mansfield was in the background on it , and what Pete King will think . But , as they say , any publicity is good ; if it puts more people in the seats , who 's going to complain ? Ace Buffington , on the other hand , does worry me . He does n't seem at all like his old self . That cloud of desperation around him is n't normal . I 'm not surprised that he tried to enlist me once again , but I am at the pleading way he did it . I know that was n't easy for Ace , and I feel a little guilty about refusing . There is something else going on , something he is n't telling me . I can sense it , and I do n't like the feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike BaileyI had n't even thought about how he 'd died . It was just there , somewhere in the recesses of my mind , another of those jazz legends that get embellished in the retelling , but nothing more . I left Los Angeles in what now seems a permanent move . I left my car and few belongings in storage with Danny Cooper , and gave notice on my Venice apartment . I simply hopped a plane to New York and points east with a vague idea of going to Europe . But now , walking through the narrow streets of the Mayfair district of London , past Rolls Royce and Jaguar showrooms , expensive boutiques , and trendy restaurants , L.A. does n't seem so far away after all . It 's always just there , just over my shoulder , with people like Mike Bailey ready to take up the thread and question my motives for being here . There are going to be more questions to answer to bring it all back , and that 's something I do n't want to do , not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
