Section : GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD <p> When considering a topic for a tribute to Wilbur Zelinsky , I immediately thought of cemeteries . The first meeting of the Association of American Geographers I attended was in 1973 , at which he presented his work on cemetery place-names , later published as " Unearthly Delights " ( 1976 ) . His enthusiasm for cemeteries as objects of geographical study made an impression , and in a landscape seminar at Pennsylvania State University in 1975 , I spoke on the topic . Now , I return to the subject with a look at the cemeteries of Portland , the largest city in Oregon  --  not their internal form but as urban land use and as places in cities . My perspective in this essay derives from recent news stories about the city 's cemeteries . Cemeteries have historically been seen primarily as sacred spaces , and that aspect should not be forgotten ; people are , after all , laid to rest in them . However , ordinary urban cemeteries are increasingly viewed as amenity landscapes that provide historic , scenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jackson 1967-1968 ; Howett 1977 ; El Nasser 1998 ) . The population of the five Oregon counties in the Portland Metropolitan Area , in northwestern Oregon , grew by 27 percent in the 1990s , but suburban expansion has been constrained by an urban growth boundary ( UGB ) . ( n1 ) Over the same decade the city of Portland 's population grew by 21 percent , although a little more than half of that was through annexation ( Edmonston , Pepos , and Stewart 2003 ) . The recognition of cemeteries as protected open spaces in the urban landscape may be particularly felt in such a rapidly growing , but bounded , area . <p> At the time of their establishment , old cemeteries were typically a fringe-belt land use in American cities . Established on what were , at the time , the outskirts of the built-up areas , many cemeteries are now surrounded by urban development and have become intimate parts of the urban fabric through annexations of outlying territory . Aside from small churchyard burial grounds and family plots , cemeteries were seldom planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Zelinsky wrote : " In few of the many maps and drawings of nineteenth-century American cities that I have recently examined is the cemetery an integral part of the initial plan . When the cemetery did come into being in plan or in actuality , it was obviously an after-thought " ( 1976,172 ) . As William H. Whyte , writing about new towns of the twentieth century , had noted earlier , " In no new town plan that I have seen is there space allotted to a cemetery " ( 1968,240 ) . David Sloane pointed out more recently that " new cemeteries are usually unwelcome in the neighborhoods of America " ( 1991,243 ) . <p> Several reasons for the outlying locations of cemeteries come to mind . In the nineteenth century , municipal governments saw burial grounds as potential health hazards . In addition , cemeteries , even those privately owned and operated for profit , were not  --  and are not  --  typically subject to property taxes , so they provide little municipal revenue . Cemetery founders sought outlying locations where large tracts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to balance fringe locations with accessibility , the developers often located cemeteries near public transit lines  --  directly along routes of urban expansion ( Pattison 1955 ; Rugg 2000 ) . In " Gathering Places for America 's Dead , " Zelinsky noted that " zones of high population density , and most particularly metropolitan areas , will acquire numerous cemeteries as a matter of course " but that " within the metropolitan areas the price of inner city real estate has propelled most cemeteries into suburban tracts " ( 1994 , 35 ) . <p> Municipal reluctance to plan for and locate cemeteries within cities is not matched by a contemporary desire to remove existing burial grounds . In many cities , including Portland , residential demand for close-in locations has led to redevelopment and infill construction . Although pressures to relocate cemeteries are recognized , opposition to such actions is significant . As Whyte stated : <p> Some kinds of under-use will not be so easily resolved . For planners , the most frustrating open spaces to contemplate are the cemeteries of the city . Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many a planner has toyed with the thought of all of the good things that could be done with the land were there a relocation effort . Those who are wise have kept the idea to themselves . Title problems are immense , and the whole subject politically explosive . ( 1968,343 ) <p> Modern-day cemetery relocations are fairly rare in the United States ( Kay 1998 ) . Cemeteries are seen as amenity open spaces ; Christopher Tunnard and Boris Pushkarev noted that <p> In the metropolitan region . such occurrences as golf courses , airports , developed parks , and even cemeteries perform the same service as would natural forests or farm lands in the country . They provide almost the only open spaces noticeable in the macrolandscape . They are the chief providers of visual relief from the monotony of continuous buildings ; often they have the allied usefulness of making the air a little cooler and cleaner for those lucky enough to live nearby . In some cases , they are entirely or partially available for physical use , in sport or passive recreation .

PORTLAND 'S EARLY CEMETERIES <p> Cemetery removals were once common in rapidly growing American cities . In his study of Chicago 's burial grounds , William Pattison ( 1955 ) found that all of the cemeteries that existed in the city in 1850 had been pushed aside by urban expansion by 1900 . Some of the earliest cemeteries in Portland  --  those that were closest to the growing business district  --  stood in the way of development and were displaced before 1900 . City Cemetery #1 was only three blocks west of the Willamette River , between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and Pine and Ankeny Streets , in the way of the expanding central business district ( Figure 1 ) . Burials were removed in 1854 and probably relocated to City Cemetery #2 , about ten blocks to the west between 11th and 12th Avenues and Stark and Washington Streets . City Cemetery #3 was just south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cemetery #4  --  the original Beth Israel cemetery  --  was south of downtown near the Ross Island Bridge . Around 1890 the burials were removed to a new cemetery , and the site became industrial land ( Lenzen 2000 ; Byrd , Clarke , and Healy 200l ) . Several outlying family plots have been abandoned by neglect . <p> The only Portland cemetery site known to have been redeveloped in the twentieth century is Saint Mary 's , the city 's first Catholic cemetery . Started in 1858 on four acres at Southeast 24th Avenue and Stark Street in what was then East Portland  --  and adjacent to Lone Fir Cemetery  --  Saint Mary 's was almost fully utilized by 1888 , when the archdiocese established Mount Calvary Cemetery in Portland 's West Hills . Saint Mary 's was closed to new burials in 1930 , and , over a seven-year period , remains were sent to other cemeteries , mostly to Mount Calvary . Central Catholic High School was then built on the site ( Lenzen 2001 ) . <p> Among the oldest existing cemeteries in Portland are seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1889 . The state 's legal definition of a pioneer cemetery is " any burial place that contains the remains of one or more persons who died before February 14 , 1909 , the 50th anniversary of Oregon Statehood " ( OCHC 2005 ) . Although this definition would encompass most of Portland 's existing cemeteries , in practical terms pioneer cemeteries are those that were founded in the nineteenth century as small family or community church plots . Over the years many of them suffered neglect , inconsistent care , and abandonment . In 1928 the Oregon legislature mandated care of pioneer cemeteries statewide and placed fourteen cemeteries  --  seven of them outside the city of Portland  --  under the ownership and responsibility of Multnomah County ( Metro 2005 ) . Portland 's largest privately owned and religious cemeteries , even with pre-1909 burials , are seldom considered pioneer cemeteries . <p> Metro , the regional land-use planning agency , acquired Multnomah County 's fourteen pioneer cemeteries in 1994 , along with the county 's parks , and added them to its regional parks and greenspaces program . The cemeteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial drain because it requires subsidy from other park operations . In 1998 Metro explored finding a private buyer or operator for the cemeteries , only to be met with public resistance and a lack of serious interest from national cemetery operators . Cemetery operators noted that low-level maintenance , vandalism , and obscurity worked against the scattered and mostly small sites . Cemetery neighbors , the Oregon Pioneer Cemetery Association , and the Oregon Historic Cemetery Association opposed any sale , arguing that the cemeteries were valuable as open space and wildlife habitat , had historical and genealogical value , and were pleasant places for walking ( Nokes and Flocke 1998 ; Scott 1998 ) . Zelinsky noted such contemporary uses for cemeteries : " Interestingly enough , once cemeteries become well established , they tend to serve as refuges for wild or nearly wild fauna of the vicinity and important sites for individual and social recreation " ( 1976,192 ) . Metro 's plan to sell the cemeteries was subsequently dropped . The public 's interest in maintaining public ownership and the belief that cemeteries are crucial open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIR CEMETERY : VISUAL AMENITY AND ETHNIC MEMORY <p> Lone Fir is the largest and most historically prominent of the region 's pioneer cemeteries and epitomizes the uses and debates surrounding urban burial grounds . The oldest existing cemetery in Portland , Lone Fir had its beginning as the burial place of Emmor Stephens in 1846 on his son 's farm , one year after the city of Portland was platted . When J. B. Stephens sold the farm in 1854 , the new owner , Colburn Barrell , promised to keep and maintain the grave on the property . Barrell was co-owner of a passenger steamship company , and , when a steamship explosion killed his partner in 1854 , Barrell set aside 10 acres for a cemetery , naming it Mount Crawford , and buried his partner and one passenger on the site . In 1855 the county surveyor officially platted the cemetery , and that is considered the date of founding ( Metro 2005 ) . In 1865 , 13 acres were purchased , and in 1866 another 7 acres were added . Barrell believed that the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land to Portland in 1866 . The city turned down the offer , on the grounds that the cemetery was too inaccessible . At that time no bridges had been built across the river , and the ferry crossing and 2-mile journey from the town center was considered too great a distance . Private investors purchased the cemetery and renamed it Lone Fir . In 1928 Multnomah County acquired Lone Fir , along with other pioneer cemeteries ( Lund 1947 ) . <p> Isolated in the midst of farms in 1866 , today Lone Fir is surrounded by residential neighborhoods . The cemetery is a significant open space , a forested setting on what is today the city 's close-in eastern side ( Figure 2 ) . Lone Fir is fenced with a single active entrance at the southwest corner . The fencing is visually open , allowing views from all sides . On my visits to the cemetery , almost all made in good weather , I have seldom seen other visitors . This is true of Portland cemeteries in general : They do not rival the city 's parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy access , and most neighborhood residents must travel a significant distance to reach the one open entrance . Unfenced cemeteries have more " destination " visitors , though still not many , including people who use the cemeteries as pathways to other destinations . <p> Lone Fir is a cemetery in active use , with many new , shiny , black marble tombstones that mark the graves of Russian immigrants ( Pancrazio 1996 ) . Metro operates the cemetery both as a burial ground and as an active greenspace . It has produced a walking tour of the cemetery , and an advocacy group , the Friends of Lone Fir Cemetery , provides education and interpretation via tours such as its " monumental evenings " held throughout the spring and summer ; a Midsummer Night 's Living History Tour , when members dress in period costumes to share stories of people who are buried in the cemetery ; and work parties to help maintain the landscape . The arboretum-like landscape at Lone Fir is the setting for tree-identification workshops conducted by Portland 's neighborhood tree-liaison program and for historical plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon . These projects seek to increase awareness of native and historic plants and to increase the wildlife-habitat value of the cemetery ( Fitzgibbon 2002 ) . <p> Lone Fir has been in the news recently regarding a 1-acre parcel at its entrance . When Multnomah County transferred the land to Metro in 1994 , the county retained ownership of the commercially zoned lot and the cemetery maintenance building . Early in 2004 the cash-strapped county proposed selling the property  --  anticipating a $750,000 sale and increased property-tax revenue over time  --  only to be met with unexpectedly strong neighborhood opposition . The controversy highlights the contradictory pressures on land use in the metropolitan region . In order to maintain the region 's UGB , land-market and planning pressure to increase housing density in existing neighborhoods is intense , including the development of underdeveloped " opportunity " sites . Pressures to develop land and increase housing density within the UGB encourage reactive efforts to preserve existing greenspaces . Lone Fir 's neighbors opposed the land sale , arguing that the parcel would make a better grand portal and land addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office building ( Nkrumah 2004b ) . <p> The disagreement on the fate of the Lone Fir parcel sounded like a typical land-development battle until questions were raised about possible human remains in this area . The building site had once been a segregated section of Lone Fir , established at the beginning of the twentieth century for Chinese immigrants . All remains were to have been removed in 1948 for reburial at other locations in Lone Fir or for return to China , but records of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association , which represents some 7,000 Chinese Americans in Portland , suggested that remains of women and children might still be on the site . The county backed away from an immediate sale and , in December 2004 , set a six-month period for the community to come up with a plan for purchase and use of the land as an expansion of Lone Fir ( Nkrumah 2004a ; Walth 2004 ) . One month later , county officials dropped all plans to sell the site and decided instead to seek historic property designation for it . Archeological investigations had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2005b ) . By April 2005 , plans called for demolition of the building and new fencing and landscaping , with talk of a memorial to Chinese immigrants and an interpretive center on the site ( Griffin 2005 ) . Although the emotional response of Portland 's Chinese community to the burials and the development plans was real and should not be discounted , the sacred nature of the burials served the purposes of groups that originally opposed the sale and private development of the parcel on open-space grounds alone . ROSE CITY CEMETERY : NEIGHBORHOOD CONFLICT <p> Founded in 1906 in northeast Portland 5 miles from downtown , Rose City Cemetery predates its surrounding residential neighborhoods . A 1914 brochure showed a rural setting and stated that the cemetery provided car service for the 5-mile trip from downtown ( Rose City Cemetery 1914 ) . Though noted for its Gypsy burials and a Japanese cemetery within its borders , Rose City lacks the historical significance and arboretum-like setting and dense tree cover of Lone Fir . <p> In 2002 Rose City sought Portland 's permission to build new mausoleums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to comment on the cemetery as an open space . Cemeteries are zoned as " open space " in Portland  --  a land-use zone " intended to preserve and enhance public and private open , natural , and improved park and recreational areas " ( City of Portland 2004 , 100-1 ) . Designated land-use functions include not only providing for outdoor recreation and protecting sensitive environmental areas but also offering contrasts to the built environment and preserving scenic qualities  --  perhaps the two cemetery functions of greatest importance to neighborhood residents . Zoning-code regulations allow structures , including chapels and mausoleums , as conditional uses , so the public has an opportunity to comment on land-use proposals . Fence standards are meant to " promote the positive benefits of fences without negatively impacting the community . " The code attempts to control the negative effects of fences that " decrease the sense of community " or " create an unattractive appearance " ( p. 100-5 ) . <p> Rather than see the area as a welcoming , park-like setting  --  in common with other cemeteries  --  residents described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fir , the privately owned , 66-acre Rose City Cemetery is fenced on all sides and has only a single public entrance . Razor-wire and chain-link privacy fencing ( Figure 3 ) , a wall of cedars along the western side , and fortress-like mausoleums cut the cemetery off from the neighborhood . Views of Mount Hood and the Cascade Mountains are blocked . Because neighbors wanted a more open setting for safety and livability , they expressed a deep mistrust of cemetery owners who wanted privacy and quiet for visitors . Residents specifically noted accessibility and visibility of land zoned as open space . One neighbor put it in near-Biblical terms : " I personally do n't have a feeling and need to look into the cemetery . But certainly to look across it ; lift up my eyes to the hills , if you will , from which cometh my strength , is certainly something we prize in Oregon and in Portland . And that is gone " ( Nkrumah 2002c ) . <p> The manager of Rose City defended a more secluded open-space function of the cemetery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in and walking , enjoying the grounds , being in a secure area . We 've got birdwatchers who come in on a regular basis . We 've got people who walk in here . And they enjoy the cemetery because it is secure , and it 's away from the traffic " ( Nkrumah 2002c ) . The outcome of the planning process was that Rose City would remove some privacy fencing , open two 60-foot view corridors in the wall of cedars , and build a sidewalk along the western side ( Nkrumah 2002a ) . RIVER VIEW CEMETERY : ROMANTIC LANDSCAPE <p> Several other Portland cemeteries put land as open space into a broader context . River View Cemetery in the southwestern hills , Mount Calvary in the western hills , and Willamette National Cemetery on the slopes of Mount Scott in southeast Portland all occupy prominent topographic settings and are large in comparison with the city 's other burial places . <p> The 332-acre River View Cemetery , the first large , privately owned cemetery in the city , is Portland 's premier version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cemetery than a simple urban/rural distinction . The move to establish new cemeteries on the outskirts of cities and to create and maintain " rural " parklike settings dates from the early nineteenth century . Of note are Mount Auburn Cemetery , established 4 miles outside Boston in Cambridge , Massachusetts in 1831 ; Philadelphia 's Laurel Hill Cemetery , created in 1835 ; Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn , New York , chartered in 1838 ; and Spring Grove Cemetery , founded in Cincinnati , Ohio in 1845 . These rural cemeteries were developed in response to overcrowding of existing city cemeteries , urban health concerns , and high land prices , but they also represented the beginnings of the Romantic landscape park movement ( Bender 1974 ; Schuyler 1986 ; Jackson and Vergara 1989 ; Linden-Ward 1989 ) . Designed for multiple functions in addition to providing burial sites , they served as carefully designed , formal arboretums , instructive of the value of nature , provided didactic historic instruction , with an emphasis on the accomplishments of important individuals as revealed on tombstones , and served as pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View opened in 1882 , on a site 5 miles from downtown Portland , with views of the city , Mount Hood , Mount Saint Helens , and the Willamette River . The plan for River View clearly reflects the influence of cemeteries like Mount Auburn , though it dates from five decades later , and stands in contrast to Lone Fir 's grid plan . Roadways are curvilinear and emphasize topography and picturesque views and settings ( Figure 4 ) . Plantings are deliberately arboretum-like . In its early days River View served a recreational function like Mount Auburn and Spring Grove , as shown in an 1886 engraving from The West Shore , a booster publication promoting the Pacific Northwest ( Figure 5 ) . As Wallace Huntington noted , " No less than parks , cemeteries gave status to a city and Lone Fir and River View are pictured in The West Shore as legitimate objects of civic pride as an appropriate place for a family outing " ( 1974,407-408 ) . River View became the cemetery of choice for Portland 's prominent families , and about sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fir , transferred to River View . <p> Adjacent to , and effectively blending into the River View landscape , are Greenwood Hills and Grand Army of the Republic Cemeteries , and just across Boone 's Ferry Road is the Beth Israel cemetery . Most of the surrounding houses date from after World War II and are interspersed with housing from the 1920s . A large , undeveloped section of River View abuts the campus of Lewis and Clark College . <p> Beth Israel Cemetery is fenced and is the only cemetery I saw that requires visitors to check in , but River View and its adjacent cemeteries are effectively open to pedestrians at all times . Although cemeteries like River View are no longer active recreational grounds , at the Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery I saw a lunchtime picnic , and picnic tables are provided in Greenwood Hills Cemetery . Bicyclists use the paved pathways through the cemetery grounds for recreational riding and as a commuting route that is safer and more pleasant than are the surrounding streets . River View has produced several self-guided tours that emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mausoleums , views , and arboretum grounds . MOUNT CALVARY CEMETERY : COMMUTER ZONE <p> Mount Calvary Cemetery , located along the forested crest of Portland 's West Hills , on Burnside Street and Skyline Boulevard , was established in 1888 on 100 acres of land purchased by the Catholic Archdiocese of Portland . At the time of its opening , Mount Calvary was a 45-minute carriage ride from downtown Portland . In 1892 the Barnes Heights and Cornell Mountain Railway extended a streetcar line to the location ( Lenzen 2001 ) . Today Mount Calvary occupies 120 acres , bisected by a major commuting route between Portland and its west-side suburbs ( Figure 6 ) . The open-space setting provides a pleasant automobile corridor , and the cemetery itself has spectacular views of Mount Hood and Mount Saint Helens . During the latter 's 2004 volcanic activity , Mount Calvary was a prime viewpoint ( Hallman and Rivera 2004 ) . Drivers heading eastward through the cemetery see a massive and prominent cedar tree . To commuters heading out of Portland in the evening , flat grave markers reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation than a somber burial ground . Like River View , Mount Calvary is unfenced and is a popular destination for walkers and joggers . Only in the last few years have signs been posted prohibiting pets in the cemetery . WILLAMETTE NATIONAL CEMETERY : NATURAL ENVIRONMENT <p> The last of the large cemeteries within Portland is Willamette National Cemetery ( Figure 7 ) , a 270-acre military cemetery , dedicated in 1951 , on Mount Scott , 10 miles southeast of downtown . Like River View and Mount Calvary , Willamette was established on land with commanding views before adjacent areas became residential . Willamette National is the only cemetery that specifically prohibits jogging , granting at least a nod toward the cemetery as sacred ground rather than playground . In 1999 the cemetery set aside 100 acres as a " natural , open space " to preserve Deardorff Creek and two branches of Wahoo Creek , which originate in the cemetery ( Briggs 1999 ) . This followed years of poor environmental management , including the filling Johnson Creek , where major attempts have been made over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only example I found of significant proactive environmental awareness of cemeteries as greenspaces . It is surprising , given the strong level of environmental awareness in the Portland setting , that cemeteries receive so little attention . In 1997 the Portland Audubon Society published a short article , " Cemeteries as Greenspaces , " in The Urban Naturalist ( Rogers 1997 ) . According to Ralph Rogers , " Virtually all remaining open spaces , including cemeteries , will increase in value to local neighborhoods and to the region . Cemeteries , especially ones owned by Metro 's Regional Parks and Greenspaces , should be managed in a way that provides multiple values , including wildlife habitat , to the community around them " ( p. 2 ) . However , Wild in the City ( Houck and Cody 2000 ) , a guide to Portland 's greenspaces , makes no mention of cemeteries as natural areas  --  despite local recognition of the need for wildlife corridors , the fact that Metro 's publicly owned cemeteries are part of its " parks and greenspaces " program , the adjacency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Willamette Greenway , and a growing international awareness of cemeteries as ecological habitats ( Roberts 1997 ) . Gary Barrett and Terry Barrett mention " a paucity of research . focused on natural or anthropocentric patches located within the urban matrix " and call for more attention to cemeteries as repositories of natural diversity , noting that " ecological research conducted at the ecosystem and landscape levels has paid little attention to areas or systems subject to intensive human disturbance " ( 2001,1820 ) . Wild in the City does , however , show a tombstone  --  location not specified  --  in an essay on where to find lichens . PORTLAND 'S SMALLER CEMETERIES <p> Portland 's large cemeteries offer the greatest opportunities for neighborhood open space and for public use , but they are not the only cemeteries in the city . A number of smaller burial grounds  --  the most prominent of which are the pioneer cemeteries owned by Metro  --  are scattered throughout the city . The largest of these comprises 5 acres ; the smallest , less than 1 acre . These sites are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery operator , when considering Metro 's proposal to sell the cemeteries , stated it would need to hire local residents to provide maintenance . In some cases the cemeteries are adjacent to  --  and , in effect , extensions of  --  larger cemeteries or other open spaces ; for example , Beth Israel , Grand Army of the Republic , and Greenwood Hills Cemeteries are contiguous with River View Cemetery . <p> In other examples , freestanding cemeteries show other uses and relationships with surrounding development . Multnomah Park Cemetery , at Southeast 82nd Avenue and Holgate Street , sits across a busy street from a shopping center ( Figure 8 ) and provides a quiet retreat for shoppers and others , including a police officer I spotted catching up on paperwork . Columbia Pioneer Masonic Cemetery , at Northeast 99th Avenue and Sandy Boulevard , has a different relationship with its neighborhood . Located just off Interstate 205 and on busy Sandy Boulevard , the cemetery is the only one I saw in which an unplanned footpath cuts directly through the grave sites ( Figure 9 ) . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner tavern , I also observed children riding bicycles across the site . Powell Grove Cemetery , at Northeast 122nd Avenue and Sandy Boulevard , no longer has any relationship to a neighborhood , rural or urban . It is isolated between a highway-interchange right-of-way island and a Kmart parking lot . This was the only publicly owned cemetery that shows little active use and no recent burials . It also is the most obvious example of how Metro 's maintenance crews have turned damaged or broken headstones into flat grave markers by embedding the pieces in concrete ( Figure 10 ) . HISTORIC LANDSCAPES , CONTEMPORARY USES <p> Cemeteries across the nation have taken on new meanings and are being used for purposes other than as grave sites . As cemetery space is filled , new burials decline , and neighborhoods change , many cemeteries have lost their traditional social connection with nearby neighborhoods . Nineteenth-century Romantic " rural cemeteries , " long engulfed by urbanization , are no longer highly popular country retreats . Desires for more active recreation spaces have generated new types of parks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The type and degree of passive recreation that once took place in cemeteries like River View is not as popular as it once was ( Schuyler and O'Donnell 2000 ) . <p> Yet these now-urban cemeteries continue to serve recreational and amenity open-space functions even if for fewer people , in Portland and elsewhere . At Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge , visitors can buy audio tours to the historic and architectural tombstones and mausoleums . At Congressional Cemetery in Washington , D.C. , a dog-walking club helps pay for the upkeep of the cemetery . The Butler University cross-country team trains at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis , Indiana ( El Nasser 1998 ; Worpole 2003 ) . " Friends " associations dedicated to cemetery care are increasingly common . Since 2002 , Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain , Massachusetts has held exhibitions of site-specific art . Its current ( 2006 ) exhibition is a 1-mile-long contemporary sculpture path , designed to encourage visitors to meander through the cemetery grounds ( Forest Hills Educational Trust 2006 ; McQuaid 2006 ) . Cemeteries have developed into multiple-use landscapes  --  contemplative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to their function as burial spaces . They reflect our changing attitudes toward the cemetery landscape and our responses to the pressures of urban development and the scarcity of open spaces in cities . Their value grows with increased interest in local history and genealogy and awareness of the need to preserve natural habitats . The authors of a British study noted : " But not every cemetery visit is to attend a particular grave . Where it has become more of an historic site than an active cemetery , people comment upon the special qualities which are unique to such a place , emphatic that cemetery and park experiences are quite different " ( Francis , Kellaher , and Neophytou 2000 , 39 ) . <p> Even though I observed a range of activities in Portland 's cemeteries , few people were using them for casual recreation  --  an occasional jogger or Cyclist , several people slowly wandering and looking at tombstones , a couple having a picnic . Dogs are prohibited in all cemeteries , so the number of walkers has diminished . More people were visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could well be one of the appealing aspects of cemeteries . David Lowenthal , in discussing memorials , wrote that " the cemetery takes on secondary historical characteristics . . No longer just a set of monuments to the departed , the cemetery becomes a relic in its own right " ( 1979,123 ) . The cemeteries of Portland continue to function as sacred burial places , historical artifacts , and natural habitats . Yet , today , the primary secular value of these urban cemeteries is as amenity open spaces that provide breaks from the built environment . Views into these cemeteries may be as important as access and daily use . FOOTNOTE <p>
