Atlanta , Georgia , 1964 Ivena stood in the small greenhouse attached to her home and frowned at the failing rosebush . The other bushes had not been affected-they flourished around her , glistening with a sprinkling of dewdrops . A bed of Darwin tulip hybrids blossomed bright red and yellow along her greenhouse 's glass shell . Behind her , against the solid wall of her house , a flat of purple orchids filled the air with their sweet aroma . A dozen other species of roses grew in neat boxes , none of them infected . But this bush had lost its leaves and shriveled in the space of five days , and that was a problem because this was n't just another rosebush . This was Nadia 's rosebush . Ivena delicately pried through the dried thorny stems , searching for signs of disease or insects . She 'd already tried a host of remedies , from pesticides to a variety of growth agents , all to no avail . It was a Serbian Red from the saxifrage family , snipped from the bush that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Ivena had left Bosnia for Atlanta , she 'd insisted on a greenhouse ; it was the one unbreakable link to her past . She made a fine little business selling the flowers to local floral shops in Atlanta , but the real purpose for the greenhouse was this one rosebush , was n't it ? Yes , she knew that as surely as she knew that blood flowed in her veins . And now Nadia 's rose was dying . Or dead . Ivena put one hand on her hip and ran the other through her gray curls . She 'd cared for a hundred species of roses over her sixty years and never , never had she seen such a thing . Each bud from Nadia 's bush was priceless . If there was a graftable branch alive shewould snip it off and nurse it back to health . But every branch seemed affected . " Oh , dear Nadia , what am I going to do ? What am I going to do ? " She could n't answer herself for the simple reason that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the possibility that this , the crown of her flower garden , might one day die for no apparent reason at all . It was a travesty . Ivena picked through the branches again , hoping that she was wrong . Dried dirt grayed her fingers . They were n't as young or as smooth as they once had been , but years of working delicately around thorns had kept them nimble . Graceful . She could walk her way through a rosebush blindfolded without so much as touching a thorn . But today she felt clumsy and old . The stalk between her fingers suddenly snapped . Ivena blinked . It was as dry as tinder . How could it fail so fast ? She tsked and shook her head . But then something caught her eye and she stopped . Immediately beneath the branch that had broken , a very small shoot of green angled from the main stalk . That was odd . She lowered her head for a closer look . The shoot grew out a mere centimeter , almost like a stalk of grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as she did she saw the tiny split in the bark along the base of that shoot . She caught her breath . Strange ! It looked like a small graft ! But she had n't grafted anything into the plant , had she ? No , of course not . She remembered every step of care she 'd given this plant over the last five years and none of them included a graft . It looked like someone had slit the base of the rosebush open and grafted in this green shoot . And it did n't look like a rose graft either . The stalk was a lighter green . So then maybe it was n't a graft . Maybe it was a parasite of some kind . Ivena let her breath out slowly and touched it again . It was already healed at the insertion point . " Hmmm . " She straightened and walked to the round table where a white porcelain cup still steamed with tea . She lifted it to her lips . The rich aroma of spice warmed her nostrils and she paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of ten feet Nadia 's rosebush looked like the Moses ' burning bush , but consumed by the flame and burned black . Dead branches reached up from the soil like claws from a grave . Dead . Except for that one tiny shoot of green at its base . It was very strange indeed . Ivena lowered herself into the old wood-spindle chair beside the table , still looking over the teacup to the rosebush . She sat here every morning , humming and sipping her tea and whispering her words to the Father . But today the sight before her was turning things on their heads . She lowered the cup without drinking . " Father , what are you doing here ? " she said softly . Not that he was necessarily doing anything . Rosebushes died , after all . Perhaps with less encouragement than other plants . But an air of consequence had settled on Ivena , and she could n't ignore it . Across the beds of flourishing flowers before her sat this one dead bush-an ugly black scar on a landscape of bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graft . " What are you saying here , Father ? " She did not hear his answer , but that did n't mean he was n't talking . He could be yelling for all she knew . Here on Earth it might come through as a distant whisper , easily mistaken for the sound of a gentle breeze . Actually the greenhouse was dead silent . She more felt something , and it could just as easily have been a draft that tickled her hair , or a finger of emotion from the past , as the voice of God . Still the scene before her began to massage her heart with fingers of meaning . She just did n't know what that meaning was yet . Ivena hummed and a blanket of peace settled over her . She whispered , " Lover of my soul , I worship you . I kiss your feet . Do n't ever let me forget . " Her words echoed softly through the quiet greenhouse , and she smiled . The Creator was a mischievous one , she often thought . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , was n't he ? A splash of red at her elbow caught her eye . It was her copy of the book . The Dance of the Dead . Its surreal cover showed a man 's face wide open with laughter , tears leaking down his cheek . Still smiling , Ivena set down her teacup and lifted the book from the table . She ran a hand over the tattered cover . She 'd read it a hundred times , of course . But it never lost its edge . Its pages oozed with love and laughter and the heart of the Creator . She opened the book and brushed through a few dozen dog-eared pages . He had written a masterpiece , and in some ways it was as much God 's words as his . She could begin in the middle or at the beginning or the end and it would n't hardly matter . The meaning would not be lost . She opened to the middle and read a few sentences . It was odd how such a story could bring this warmth to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was because her eyes had been opened a little as well . She 'd seen a few things through God 's eyes . Ivena glanced up at the dying rosebush with its impossible graft . Something new was beginning today . But everything had really started with the story in her hands , had n't it ? A small spark of delight ran through her bones . She smoothed her dress , crossed her legs and lowered her eyes to the page . Yes , this was how it all started . Twenty years ago in Bosnia . At the end of the war with the Nazis . She read . Father Micheal saw the soldiers when they entered the cemetery at the edge of the village . Their small shapes emerged out of the green meadow , like a row of scarecrows tattered by the war . He pulled up and a chill swept down his spine . For a moment the children 's laughter about him waned . Dear God , protect us . He prayed the words as he had prayed them a hundred times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fingers . They were a haggard lot . Then again , any soldier who 'd managed to survive the brutal fighting that had ravaged Yugoslavia in its liberation from the Nazis would look no different . It was commonplace . But their presence here , in this secluded valley hidden from the war , was not commonplace . The smell of hot baked bread wafted through his nostrils . A shrill giggle echoed through the courtyard ; water gurgled from the natural spring to his left . Father Micheal stood stooped atop the stone-hewn steps that led to the tall church behind him , and looked past the courtyard in which the children and women laughed in celebration of Nadia 's birthday , past the tall stone cross that marked the entrance to the graveyard , past the red rosebushes Claudis Flouta had so carefully planted about her home , to the lush hillside on the south . To the four-no five-to the five soldiers approaching . He glanced around the courtyard-they laughed and played , enjoying the cele-bration . None of the others had seen the soldiers yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see four of them circling . He 'd dreamed of ravens twice in the last week and each time he 'd awoken shaken . But surely this was nothing more than a coincidence . Father , protect your children . A flutter of wings to his right caught his attention . He turned and watched a white dove settle for a landing on the vestibule 's roof . It cocked its head and eyed him in small jerky movements . " Father Micheal ? " a child 's voice said . Micheal turned to face Nadia , who stood trying to hide a faint grin . She wore a pink dress reserved for special occasions . Her eyes sparked blue , like the sea , innocent above a wide nose and blotchy freckles . Her left leg was two inches shorter than her right compliments of polio-a bad case when she was only three . Perhaps their handicaps united them in ways the others could not understand . She with her short leg ; he with his hunched back . " Yes . " " Petrus says that since I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him that he 's being a foolish little boy , but he insists on running around making a silly game of it . Could you please tell him to stop ? " Petrus ran up , sneering . If any of the town 's forty-three children was a bully , it was this nine-year-old . Oh , he had his sweet side , no doubt . Micheal had repeatedly insisted so to the boy 's mother who was known to run about the village with her apron flying , leaving wafts of flour in her wake , shaking her rolling pin while calling for the rascal to get his little rear end home . " Nadia loves Milus ! Nadia loves Milus ! " he chanted and skipped by , looking back , daring her to take up chase . " You 're a misguided fledgling , Petrus , " Nadia said , crossing her arms . " A silly little bird , squawking too much . Why do n't you find your worms somewhere else ? " Petrus pulled up , flushing red . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eating worms . With Milus ! Nadia and Milus sitting in a tree , eating all the worms they can see ! " He sang the verse again and ran off with a whoop , obviously delighted with his victory . Nadia placed her hands on her hips and tapped her shorter leg with a disgusted sigh . " You see . He 's also insisting this madness about Milus . Please stop him , Father . " " Of course , darling . But you know that he is just playing . " Father Micheal smiled . Nadia might never win a beauty contest , but she surely had the quickest wit of any child he knew . He suppressed the urge to sweep her off her feet and swing her around in his arms . " Come unto me as little children , " the Master had said . If only the whole world were filled with the innocence of children . Or better yet , filled with the innocent tenacity of Nadia-among all of these children protected from the war 's ravages in this hidden village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite her uncanny perception of truth and dogged determination to defend that truth . If there was a such a thing as a spiritual prodigy , Nadia was one such person . Ivena stopped her reading and looked up , chuckling . Nadia had always been such a smart one . Always would be . She picked up her cup of tea and sipped . And what smart words would Nadia have for the death of her rosebush ? She set the cup down and continued . Father Micheal looked over the courtyard . Of the village 's seventy remaining souls , all but ten or so had come today for Nadia 's birthday . Only the men were missing , called off to war . The elderly sat in groups about the stone tables , grinning and chatting as they watched the children play a party game that Ivena , Nadia 's mother , conducted . Several of the mothers busied themselves over a long table on which they had arranged pastries and the cake Ivena had fretted over for two days . It was perhaps the grandest cake Micheal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink roses made from frosting . Micheal 's heart swelled . They were his children . All of them . God had given him these to care for as his own twenty years earlier and he had done so . It had been his first and only church . From the corner of his eyes he saw that the soldiers drew nearer and he cast them a glance . Micheal held his robe and sat on the steps . " Come here , Nadia . " He lifted an arm for her to sit by him and she limped up the steps . A spark filled her blue eyes and he knew that thoughts of the boy 's teasing had taken flight . Nadia sat beside him and he pulled her close . She laid her head on his shoulder and put a frail arm around his back , rubbing his humped back as if it were a perfectly natural feature . He swallowed a lump gathering in his throat and kissed the top of her head . " Do n't mind Petrus , dear . I fear one day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you will be . " She showed her age now with a little giggle . The soldiers drew near through the graveyard not a hundred yards off . They were Partisans , he saw with some relief . Partisans were likely friendly . High above the ravens cawed . There were five now , black against the white sky . Micheal looked to his right , to the vestibule roof . The lone dove stared on and clucked with its one eye peeled to the courtyard . Father Micheal looked back to the soldiers . " Nadia , go tell your mother to come , " he said . She followed his stare and saw them . The smile left her . Janjic Jovic , the nineteen-year-old writer turned soldier , followed the others to the village , trudging with the same rhythmic cadence his marching had found in the endless months leading up to this day . Just one foot after another . Ahead and to the right of him their commander , Karadzic , marched deliberately . The other three were fanned out to his left . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at the top of the hill an hour earlier , when they 'd first stumbled on this valley . Their mission was to join the main column twenty miles north , not go searching for churches to burn . The commander had nearly bitten Janjic 's head off with his crude diatribe on the real purpose for this war . It had much less to do with Nazis and much more to do with restoring Serbia ; the purging of her enemies-and that included anyone who was n't a good Serb . Especially Franciscans . The whole thing was nonsense , of course . They all knew that Karadzic killed good Serbs as easily as Franciscans . His own mother , for example ; with a knife , he 'd bragged . For being both a Christian and a whore . Never mind that she was Serbian to the marrow . And one day the crazed commander would try to kill him . Janjic could feel it in his bones . He was a philosopher-a writer-not a killer , and Karadzic despised him for it . As a simple matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man obediently to the end of the war . He slogged on , regretting his open opposition of Karadzic 's decision to descend into the village . It had been the second time in the last week . Once more and he just might find a bullet smashing through his teeth . Only when they were within a stone 's throw of the village did Janjic study the scene with a careful eye . They approached from the south , through a graveyard holding fifty or sixty stones . This was the first oddity that struck him . So few graves . In any village throughout Bosnia you could expect to find hundreds if not thousands of fresh graves , pushing into neighboring lots never intended for burying the dead . They were the undeniable markers of a war gone mad . But in this village , hidden here in this lush green valley , he counted no more than ten plots that looked recent . He studied the neat rows of houses now-fewer than fifty-also unmarked by the war . The tall church spire stood high above the houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . It looked unlike most he 'd seen . Orthodox ? Perhaps Catholic , which in Karadzic 's view would be as bad as Franciscan , Janjic thought . The rest of the structure rose in gray stone , elegantly carved like most churches he 'd seen . Small castles made for God . None in the squad cared much for God-not even the Jew , Paul . But in Bosnia , religion had little to do with God . It had to do with who was right and who was wrong , not with who loved God . If you were n't Orthodox or at least a good Serb , you were n't right . If you were a Christian but not an Orthodox Christian , you were n't right . If you were Franciscan , you were most certainly not right . Thinking of it all , Janjic was n't sure he disagreed : Karadzic was right-religious affiliation was more a defining line of this war than the Nazi occupation . The Ustashe , Yugoslavia 's brand of the Gestapo , had murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd done it with the blessing of both the Catholic Archbishop of Sarajevo and the Franciscans , neither of whom evidently understood the love of God . But then no one in this war knew much about the love of God . It was a war absent of God , if indeed there even was such a being . A child suddenly ran past the walls that surrounded the courtyard , out toward the tall cross , not fifty feet from them now . A boy , dressed in a white shirt and black shorts , with suspenders and a bow tie . The child slid to a halt , his eyes popping when he saw them . Janjic smiled at the sight . The smell of hot bread filled his nostrils . " Petrus ! You come back here ! " A woman , presumably the boy 's mother , ran past the wall . She ran for the boy , grabbed his arm and yanked him back toward the churchyard . He struggled free and ran for Karadzic . Stopping ten feet from the commander , the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ! One , two ! Swinging his arms and lifting his knees like a soldier on parade . " Petrus ! Come back here ! " the woman demanded . She pulled him toward the courtyard , smiling apologetically at the soldiers . Karadzic ignored the boy entirely and kept his eyes fixed ahead . He was a tall man , six foot two at least , and boxy above the waist . His bulky torso rested on spindly legs , like a bulldog born on stilts . His face was square and leathery , pitted by a collage of small scars . Glassy gray eyes peered past eyebrows so thick they obscured his eyelashes from view . Janjic was the last to enter the courtyard , following the others ' clomping boots . Karadzic halted and they pulled up behind him . Janjic sidestepped for a clear view . What he saw then made him blink . A priest stood on the ancient church steps , dressed in flowing black robes . His hair fell to his shoulders ; a beard extended several inches past his chin . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not so severe that he was stooped to the ground , but enough so that it could not be hidden . Yet it was the priest 's soft smile beneath brilliant green eyes that stopped them all , Janjic thought . That and the children sitting on the steps at his feet , all staring with wide eyes now , smiling at the soldiers ' sudden appearance around the wall . And the mothers who sat with the children , holding them , smoothing their hair or stroking their cheeks . Smiling . All of them seemed to be smiling . Smiling and staring as if some long-lost prodigal had just stepped into town . In all , fifty or sixty pairs of eyes gleamed across the courtyard , fixed on the soldiers . " Welcome to Vares , " the priest said , bowing politely . They had interrupted a party of some kind , Janjic saw . The children were mostly dressed in ties and dresses . A long table adorned with pastries and a cake sat untouched to their left . The sight seemed surreal to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What church is this ? " Karadzic demanded . " Anglican , " the priest said . " Angli . . . ? " Karadzic glanced at his men , then faced the church . " I 've never heard of this church . " A young girl in a pink dress suddenly stood from her mother 's arms and walked awkwardly toward the table adorned with pastries . She hobbled with a limp . Karadzic ignored her and twisted his fingers around the barrel of his rifle , tapping its butt on the stone . " Why is this church still standing ? " No one answered the question . Janjic watched the little girl place a golden brown pastry on a napkin . " So now you ca n't speak ? " Karadzic demanded . " Every church for a hundred miles is burned to the ground , but yours is standing , untouched . And it makes me think that maybe you 've been sleeping with the Ustashe . " " God has granted us favor , " the priest said . The commander paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweat broke from the large man 's forehead and ran down his flat cheek . " God has granted you favor ? He 's flown out of the sky and built an invisible shield over this valley to keep the bullets out . " His lips flattened suddenly . " That 's nonsense , you fool . God has allowed every Orthodox church in Yugoslavia to burn to the ground . And yet yours is not . " To their right , the child hobbled toward a spring that gurgled in the corner and dipped a mug into its waters . No one seemed to pay her attention except the woman on the steps whom she had left , presumably her mother . She watched her young daughter with scrunched brow . The Jew Paul spoke quietly . " They 're Anglican , not Franciscans or Catholics . I know Anglicans . They 're good Serbs . " Karadzic glared at Paul . " And you 're a Jew . " " I 'm only telling you what I know , " Paul said with a shrug . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug of cold water in one hand and the pastry in the other . She stopped three feet from Karadzic and lifted the food to him . None of the villagers moved . Karadzic ignored her . " And if you 're protected by God , why does n't your God also protect the true church of Serbia ? The Orthodox church ? " The priest smiled gently , still staring without blinking , hunched over on the steps . " I 'm asking you a question , Priest . " " I can not speak for God . Perhaps you should ask him , " the priest said . The answer made the commander blink . " I meant no disrespect , sir . " The father dipped his head . " We are God-loving people with no quarrel . " The small girl stood still , offering the pastry and water to the commander . Karadzic 's face turned red and his eyes took on that menacing stare Janjic had seen so many times before . Janjic moved on impulse . He stepped up to the girl and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only a good Serb would offer bread and water to a tired and hungry Partisan soldier . " He reached for the pastry and took it . " Thank you . " As if the words had released them from an unseen grip , a dozen children stood from the stairs and ran to the table in a mad scramble , arguing about who was to be first . They quickly gathered up food to follow the young girl 's example and then rushed for the soldiers bearing pastries and beaming . The children were strikingly innocent , Janjic thought . This was just another game to them . The sudden turn in events had effectively silenced Karadzic , but Janjic dared not look at the commander . If Molosov and the others did n't take his que there would be hell to pay later-this he knew with certainty . " My name is Nadia , " the young girl said , looking up at Janjic . " It 's my birthday today . I 'm twelve years old . " Ordinarily Janjic would have answered the girl-told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was on his comrades . Several children now swarmed around Paul and Puzup , and Janjic saw with relief that they were accepting the pastries . With smiles in fact . " Karadzic . We could use the food , sir , " Molosov , their second in command , said . Nadia held the cup in her hand toward Karadzic . Once again every eye turned to the commander , begging him to show some sense ; pleading for a breath of mercy . A thin grin curved Karadzic 's lips . Janjic looked at the women on the steps and saw their eyes light like jewels . Karadzic suddenly slapped the cup aside , sending it flipping through the air and clattering along the stone . Water showered the steps , staining them in dark blotches . The children serving their pastries spun toward Nadia . Karadzic brushed angrily past her . She backpedaled and fell to her bottom . The commander stormed over to the birthday table , and kicked his boot against the leading edge . The entire birthday display rose into the air and crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limped quickly for her mother , who drew her in . The other children scampered for the steps . Karadzic turned to them , his face red . " Now do I have your attention ? "
