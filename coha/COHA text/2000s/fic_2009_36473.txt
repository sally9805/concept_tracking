ONE <p> The rain pelting Seventh Avenue tasted of diesel and big-city friction . Sean Syrrell stared out the limo 's open window and let the day weep for him . <p> Sean gripped his chest with one hand , trying to compress his heart back into shape . His granddaughter managed to make the end of the block only because her aunt supported her . They turned the corner without a backward glance . Not till they were lost from view did Sean roll up his window . <p> Storm 's survival demanded that she be cut loose . He had fired her because it was the only way he could protect her . Sean knew the enemy was closing in . He had felt the killer 's breath for days . Storm was his last remaining hope for achieving his lifelong dream , and establishing his legacy . <p> But the knowledge he had been right to fire her did little to ease the knife-edged pain that shredded his heart . <p> The driver asked , " Everything okay , Mr. Syrrell ? " <p> Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver was new , but the company was the only one he used ever since the danger had been revealed . If the enemy wanted a way to monitor his movements in New York , he 'd handed it to them on a platter . " Why do n't you go for a coffee or something . I 'd like a moment . " <p> " No can do , sir . I leave the wheel , they pull my license . " <p> Sean stared blindly at the rain-streaked side window . He could only hope that one day Storm would understand , and tell Claudia , and the pair of them would forgive him . <p> Unless , of course , he was wrong and the threat did not exist . <p> But he was n't wrong . <p> " Mr. Syrrell ? " <p> Sean opened his door and rose from the car . " Drop my bags off at the hotel . We 're done for the day . " <p> Sean passed the Steinway showroom 's main entrance , turned the corner , pressed the buzzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . A white-suited apprentice grinned a hello and led him downstairs . Sean greeted the technicians , most of whom he knew by name . He chatted about recent acquisitions and listened as they spoke of their charges . The ladies in black . Always feminine . Always moody and temperamental . Always in need of a firm but gentle hand . <p> Among professional pianists , the Steinway showroom 's basement was a place of myth . The long room was clad in whitewashed concrete . Beneath exposed pipes and brutal fluorescent lights stood Steinway 's most valuable asset : their collection of concert pianos . <p> All but one were black . The exception had been finished in white as a personal favor to Billy Joel . Otherwise they looked identical . But each instrument was unique . The Steinway basement had been a place of pilgrimage for over a hundred years . Leonard Bernstein , Vladimir Horowitz , Sergei Rachmaninoff , Leon Fleisher , Elton John , Glenn Gould , Alfred Brendel , Mitsuko Uchida . They all came . An invitation to the Steinway basement meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles . <p> Sean Syrrell had not been granted access because of his talent . As a pianist , he was mechanical . He did not play the keys so much as box with the music . He lacked the finesse required for greatness . But fifteen years ago , he had done Steinway a great favor . He had located and salvaged the grand that had graced the White Palace , summer home to the Russian czars . <p> After the Trotsky rebellion , the piano had vanished . For years the world believed that Stalin had placed it in his dacha , then in a drunken rage had chopped it up for firewood . But Sean had found it in a Krakow junk shop the year after the Berlin Wall fell , just one more bit of communist flotsam . He had smuggled it west , where Germany 's finest restorer had spent a year returning it to its original pristine state . It was now housed in the Steinway family 's private collection . <p> The basement was overseen by Steinway 's chief technician . He and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert grand . Sean spent a few minutes listening and discussing the piano 's raw tones . Then he moved to his favorite . CD18 was more or less retired from service after 109 years of touring . Occasionally it was brought out as a favor to a special Steinway client . The last time had been for a voice-piano duet  --  Lang Lang and Pavarotti . For fifteen years , Van Cliburn had begged Steinway to sell him the instrument . Yet here it remained . <p> Sean seated himself and ran through a trio of exercises . His hands were too stubby for concert-quality play , his manner at the keys too brusque . Added to that were his failing ears , which had lost a great deal of their higher-range tonality . And his strength , which these days was far more bluster than muscle . And his heart , which still thudded painfully from firing Storm . <p> This time , it took a great deal longer than usual to leave the world behind . He hovered , he drifted , yet he was not transported . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When peace finally entered his internal realm , Sean switched to an Ttude by Chopin . It was a courtly dance , even when thumped out by his bricklayer 's hands . The instrument was bell-like , a radiant sound that caused even his antiquated frame to resonate . <p> Between the first and second movement , his playing transported him away from the realm of business and debt and his own multitude of failings . He knew others believed he harbored an old man 's fantasy of playing on the concert stage . But that was rubbish . He was here because twice each year , for a few treasured moments , an instrument brought him as close to divinity as Sean Syrrell would ever come . At least , so long as he was chained to this traumatic ordeal called life . <p> Sean detected a subtle shift in the chamber 's atmosphere . He was well aware of what it probably meant . He shut his eyes and turned to his favorite composer . Brahms was so very right for the moment , if indeed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahms above all composers had managed to form prayer into a series of notes . Yet Brahms had always been the hardest for Sean to play . Brahms required gentle eloquence . Normally Sean Syrrell played with all the gentleness of a drummer . <p> Today , however , Sean found himself able to perform the melody as it should be performed , as a supplicant with a lover 's heart . <p> Then Sean heard a different sound . A quiet hiss , accompanied by a puff of air on his cheek . <p> Sean opened his eyes in time to see a hand reflected in the piano 's mirrored surface , moving away from his face . It held a small crystal vial . <p> Sean 's cry of alarm was stifled by what felt like a hammer crashing into his chest . He doubled over the instrument , and his forehead slammed into the keyboard . But he heard none of it . <p> His entire being resonated with a single clarity of purpose , as strong as a funeral bell . He had been right all along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his fingers slipped from the keys , still he played on . <p> His final thought was of Storm , which was only fitting . She was , after all , his one remaining earthbound hope . <p> He was carried along with notes that rose and rose until they joined in celestial perfection , transporting him into the realm he had prayed might find room for him . Even him . <p> Gold of Kings 2009 by Davis Bunn <br> Continues ...
