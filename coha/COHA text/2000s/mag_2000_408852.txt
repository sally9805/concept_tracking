Blending high performance with driving pleasure , five new models signal the Headnote rebith of the classic sports car . Photograph Photograph // THE HONDA S2000 charges up the Hilltop . Turn flat-out in second gear with its engine shrieking past its 7,500-rpm torque peak . A determined tug at the wheel cocks the agile roadster toward the crucial blind-apex entry onto Waterford Hills ' main straightaway . Hilltop and 13 more devilish bends crammed into a 1.4-mile circuit prompted racing legend Sterling Moss to pronounce this track near Pontiac , Michigan , the most challenging road-racing course in America . That qualifies Waterford as the perfect place to test the mettle of the latest crop of sports cars enriched by technological trickle-down from their manufacturers ' racing programs . The Audi TT ( left ) , BMW M Coupe , Mazda MX-5 Miata , and Porsche 911 Carrera 4 that lined up with the Honda S2000 on the Waterford grid cut a broadswath in price , mechanical specifications , and performance . So boadi that , instead of establishing a pecking order based disparate criteria , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that a legitimate sports car should be just as adept sliding around corners on a race trackack as it is in entertaining its driver on a daily commute . Ten years ago , Mazda began a renaissance in two-seat entertainmentthe heyday of classic European roadsters ended in the 1970s-by dusting off long-abandoned plans for a lightweight , affordable sports car . The Tenth Anniversary Edition MX-5 Miata brings such second-generation improvements as a six-speed transmission , polished wheels , and sport suspension tuning to the party , but the original concept has n't changed an iota . For slightly more than $20,000 in base trim and less than $30,000 loaded , the Miata delivers a full measure of go-stopturn delight , with wind in your ears to boot . Whether you 're charging a mountain pass or cruising to the Cool Cone , fun is always along for the ride . On the racetrack , the Miata 's 140horsepower 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine lacks the spunk to run at the head of this pack , but its responsiveness and balance keep it a serious contender . Selecting a ratio in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch . Keep the tach needle racing toward the 7,000-rpm redline and you 'll blow past 60 mph in 8.5 seconds . The driveline is guy-wire taut , so when your toe signals go , the Miata wastes no time taking up slack . Turning agility is the Miata 's forte , thanks to the best vehicle dynamics available at any price : the sharpest steering , lightest curb weight , and shortest wheelbase of our five-car group . The Miata showed its taillamps to all comers except the Honda in the double-lane change , and it racked up a strong third place in the slalom . Hotlapping Waterford , the Miata clipped apexes with surgical precision and took the more gentle , high-speed turns with a single-seat racer 's keen balance . This agility is equally handy for zipping through traffic on the way to work . Honda 's spanking-new S2000 is the same idea advanced several rungs up the performance ladder . Cowl-shake quivers , a noticeable Miata shortcoming , are prevented by a sturdy Xshaped backbone welded integrally with the Honda 's unit body . Antilock brakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph The Honda S2000 's high-intensity headlights pour out ultrabright beams . The top raises In a mere 5 seconds . With a bubble shape and minimalist , polished metal interior , the Audi TT looks like a get-down-tobusiness race car . // Honda engineers drew on 40 years of car and motorcycle racing experience to create a remarkable , light engine that greatly benefits the car 's weight distribution . The key to squeezing 240 horsepower from a small , light package is a phenomenally high redline . To elevate the torque peak to 7,500 rpm , the horsepower peak to 8,300 rpm , and the maximum rpm limit to an astronomical 9,000 revs , key moving parts-crankshaft , connecting rods , pistons-are made of forged materials for high strength and low weight . Two-phase variable valve timing adjusts intake and exhaust valve operation according to rpm . The air filter and dual mufflers are each nearly as large as the engine itself to handle flow . Parasitic losses are minimized with electrically driven air injection and power steering pumps . A racy cockpit sets the proper mood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , an electronic tachometer sweeps in a broad arc over a digital speedometer . A red starter button located to the left of the steering column fires up the engine , and a polished aluminum shift knob clicks through six closely spaced transmission ratios . In around-town driving , performance is sluggish . Until the tach registers at least 5,000 rpm , there 's a severe torque shortage , particularly if you 're caught in the wrong gear . A sharp transformation occurs when the variable valve timing system switches into high-performance mode and the torque curve swerves smartly upward . Then the engine begins sounding like it 's ripping sheets of aluminum ; serious acceleration kicks in ; and this roadster 's mood flips from reluctant cruiser to take-no-hostages formula racer . The S2000 is the most demanding machine under test because it insists on a heavy foot on the throttle , an earnest grip on the wheel , and a highly sensitive , seat-of-the-pants reactiveness to extract its full potential . So driven , Honda 's phenom set the pace in the handling tests and ran to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Feedback from the electrically assisted power steering gear is only slightly less communicative than the more conventional power-assist system in the Miata . Pressed to the limit of adhesion , there 's mild understeer ( front slides first ) turning in to the apex of a bend and gentle , controllable oversteer ( rear drifts wide ) during exit . At $32,415 , Honda 's 52000 will go down as the bargain of the century . But fewer than 10,000 cars per annum will be available in the United States , so dealer markups are inevitable . Photograph You 'll either love the BMW M Coupe 's design or hate it , but there 's no denying its thoroughbred 3.2-liter inline-six engine . Gone are the Mazda MX-5 Miata 's flip-up headlights . A new six-speed transmission shifts at the flick of a wrist . // Audi 's TT coupe is one notch up the price scale but philosophically miles away from the Honda S2000 . In contrast to the Honda 's specially engineered , handcrafted components , the TT shares a platform with the VW Jetta and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wow " from every angle , especially when compared with the S2000 's sedate wedge theme . In line with sports car tradition , the TT has an advanced 20-valve fourcylinder engine under the hood , aided and abetted by turbocharging and intercooling . The torque peaks early , so around town the engine feels significantly larger than its 1.8 liters . But contrary to the cardinal rules of driving fun , the 180 horsepower drives the front wheels only . That imposes no particular hardship during regular driving , but it 's a severe handicap on the racetrack , where trimming lap times requires every last ounce of performance . Throttle response is lackadaisical . The TT passed the Miata on the way to 60 mph , but just barely . Because momentum lost to tire slip while veering through slalom cones could n't be recovered in a timely fashion , the TT was dead last in that test . On the racetrack , its steering felt mushy , the shifter occasionally jammed in second gear , and forward thrust never fell into synch with throttle position . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering wheel , the front tires always complained of abuse in the turns . Clearly , the Audi TT is out of its element hammering around a racetrack . This car would rather turn heads than corners . The real fun is viewing the world through gun-slit windows and savoring the rich feel of polished metal interior furnishings . The TT may be a good sport , but it 's definitely the odd man out in this group of vivacious sports cars . Like the TT , BMW 's Z3-based M Coupe thumbs its nose at conventional exterior design . The apt German descriptor is eigenwillig : determinedly going its own way . Whether or not you appreciate the mini-delivery-truck exterior theme , it 's hard not to admire this machine 's sporting soul . The thoroughbred 3.2liter inline-six engine pours forth a rich and hearty torque stew . What the suspension lacks in design sophistication , it more than makes up for in tuning refinement . The only character flaw is the M 's tendency to squat on its haunches in response to each jab of the throttle . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixty miles per hour flashes by in 5.4 seconds . Top-gear acceleration leaves the other competitors choking in BMW dust . And while sports car chapter and verse says firm suspension calibrations are the key to agility , the M Coupe proves that axiom wrong . It 's supple over bumps and fluid in the turns . Like the Miata , the M Coupe is enjoyable to drive at a pace well below its full potential . But ask it to dance through the slalom or around the racetrack and it follows your lead like Arthur Murray . Whether you prefer controlled slides or stable tracking through the S-bends , the M Coupe complies . Brake rotors as large as dinner plates deliver seatbelt-stretching deceleration . The M Coupe ca n't match the commune-with-nature attributes of the roadster from which it springs , but there are compensations . The closed body structure is significantly tighter , quieter , and rattle resistant , particularly at speed . The extended roofline encloses 9 cubic feet of storage space and offers enhanced security for both occupants and their possessions . Those who find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first all-new Porsche 911 in 34 years . The company whose sole mission is sports cars saved the distinctive exterior form and rearengine chassis layout of the original 911 introduced at the 1963 Frankfurt Auto Show while incorporating comprehensive upgrades to the powertrain , suspension , and body structure . Key features-most notably the front third of the body and the basic water-cooled engine design-are shared with the Porsche Boxster . Key dimensions have been stretched to enhance passenger room and comfort . This is a mature GT machine with little engine and wind noise , a pleasant highway ride , and seats that coddle you on long road trips . Photograph The Porsche 911 Carrera 4 's electronic stability control helps cornering . The steering wheel continues to be nonadjustable. // The 911 Carrera 4 tested features all-wheel-drive provided by a viscous coupling between the front axle and the rear-mounted transmission . That means a four-season machine that 's safe and enjoyable to drive even under slippery conditions that consign most sports cars to the garage . Other specialties : a drive-by-wire throttle regulating the 296-hp 3.4-liter flat-six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Porsche 's first electronic stability system is so far an exclusive Carrera 4 feature . It comes in handy when the heavy-tailed 911 struggles to keep up with lighter , better balanced competitors . In the slalom and double-lane change , the Porsche is a handful at the limit with the stability system off . Ease the throttle to reduce speed , and the tail slips wide . If you keep steady pressure on the accelerator , the nose pushes past the desired path . But when the stability system is switched on , early and assertive one-wheel-braking corrections keep both ends of the car in line . Even then , the 911 was 2 to 3 mph off the pace in handling . In this instance , advanced technologies - all- wheel drive and aggressive stability managementdo n't fully compensate for less-than-optimum balance . The extra weight and traction of the all-wheel drive are just enough of a burden to keep the 911 from beating the BMW in straightline acceleration . But do n't write off the 911 . It showed the field how it 's done in braking , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 911 also found a racing groove . Using its mighty brakes , hardy torque curve , and high-speed stability , it was the only car to crack the 60-mph average barrier around the twisty course . Our tests demonstrate a revitalized category . Truest to the classic standard , the Mazda is a ball to drive irrespective of venue . Every driver should enjoy this affordable fun , if only as an antidote to the minivan or SUV in the next bay . The Audi is this year 's fashion plate ; what it lacks in fun it more than makes up for in aesthetics . The BMW also sets appearance standards while never failing to enthrall when the engine is gunned . The Honda is rough and raw-boned when driven moderately , but keep the throttle down and the tach needle up and it rushes as close as you can get to race car performance without relinquishing your license plates . And the Porsche proves that injections of technology can keep the senior member of the sports car club at peak performance . // <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
