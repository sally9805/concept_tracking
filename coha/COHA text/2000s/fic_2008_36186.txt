Luc O'Neil was lost . <p> He was n't particularly worried . <p> His cell phone would n't work down in the labyrinth nine hundred feet below the frozen layer of earth , but the homing device required of everyone entering the mine was glowing bright green . The pipe , the vein of rock that contained the diamonds , was a reasonably rich one . Nothing exceptional but productive , small , brown gems that would go mainly into industrial tools and the vast stockpile of the Russian diamond monopoly Alorosa , which in turn sold its holdings to DeBeers . <p> Twenty percent of all diamonds mined worldwide were from Russia and all of the mines , Luc knew , were located in Siberia . If they dared , which they would not do because there would be no profit in it , Alorosa could challenge DeBeers and flood the market with relatively inexpensive diamonds of all quality levels . It was a standing , unspoken suicidal threat , a doomsday scenario for the diamond market . The price paid by <p> the world for diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The value of diamonds , as Luc knew , was not dependent on their rarity , but on the ability of the diamond cartel to control their flow and price . Luc was well aware that diamonds are nothing but pieces of compressed carbon found not only in Siberia but in Botswana , Australia , South Africa , and , to a smaller degree , all over the planet . <p> But production was down in this mine . Or at least that was what Luc had been told . His job was to find out if the mine was so tapped out that it would not pay to keep it operating . <p> Luc was a geologist with a good underground sense of direction . But if that failed him , he could always follow the dull yellow lights that glowed indifferently every fifty yards or so on the jagged walls of the tunnel . <p> He was contracted with and well paid by the Canadian company that owned a piece of this operation . And so , screw ' em . He had a job to do , plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , e-mail his report to London , let DeBeers deal with it , and get the hell back to Toronto . Luc had missed his son 's birthday only two months ago , when he was in Australia . Collette had not bothered to reproach him . What was the point ? Let the boy know what kind of father he had , she had said . Well , she was right . <p> Luc scanned the walls for signs . He had been doing this for a decade . He did n't have to think about what he was looking for . It either felt right or it did n't . The diamond sense was a part of him . He was a human detector . <p> Dobson had told Luc he had been selected because he had more experience in this sort of thing . What sort of thing ? Going into underground diamond mines , finding out why production was down , and determining if the mines were finally tapped out ? <p> Dobson was at a surface mine in Botswana . Hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . <p> Dobson could get to Capetown in less than three hours from even the most distant company mine in Southern Africa . There were places in Capetown , good food , warm beds , and warmer women ranging from pale , ghostly white to dark , smooth ebony . And then Dobson would be stopping to meet with diamond cutters in Tel Aviv where , in spite of the slight threat of suicide bombers , he would stay overnight in a luxury suite in the Dan Tel Aviv Hotel . Luc , on the other hand , would spend the night in a visitor 's room in the four-story concrete block that housed the mine 's middle-management workers here in Devochka . <p> Luc knelt next to the wall to his right . He had insisted on coming this way , even climbing over the dust-covered yellow machinery and down the slight incline . There was a feel of something this way . <p> His guide , an old night-duty mine watchman , Boris Antonovich , had told him that this shaft needed shearing up . Boris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been Luc 's choice as a guide , but Boris had one advantage . He could speak a little French . <p> Luc had not even bothered to answer when Boris issued his warning about the shaft . The geologist had simply gone down the tunnel , examining the walls , taking samples , seeing nothing of great interest , going deeper and deeper , farther and farther . And then he had noticed that Boris was not behind him . <p> Probably back there sulking because Luc had come this way instead of to the tunnel to the right that Boris had suggested . <p> " This is an old shaft , " Boris had said . " It 's not worked anymore . " <p> Luc had known this . <p> " It is dangerous , " Boris had said . <p> " Danger is relative , " Luc answered . <p> " Physical danger is absolute . " <p> A Russian philosopher in Siberia . Just what Luc needed . <p> " I 'm going in , " Luc had said . <p> Boris had shrugged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a craggy roof and wall and an even , flat floor . Rubber-reinforced trucks , with beds that could hold 10,000 tons of ore , had ample room to rumble into the darkness at the end of the yellow tunnel . <p> Boris 's arguments for not going into this particular shaft were very persuasive , but not in the way the Russian desired . The more Boris warned , the more determined Luc had been to go this way . In a battle of wills between a Russian and a Canadian , the man with the money and the gun will always win . Luc had a gun . <p> Luc was no fool . He had started carrying the weapon at first because of the stories others had told about being threatened , attacked . Rumor was that an Australian geologist who worked for the company had been beaten to death at a mine site in the Outback . <p> Luc , on his third trip to a site , had been attacked by a black mine worker in Namibia . The man was tall , lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing rage , his mouth spewing , cracking with a babble of language Luc did n't understand . <p> In the man 's right hand had been a rock . He had run at Luc , who was aware of voices , dark faces behind the man with the rock . Luc had fired . Once . The lean man fell to his knees , still looking at Luc , still babbling . The lean man did n't die . He had attacked Luc because he was the only white man present . He had attacked Luc because the man 's wife had died and the man did n't have enough money to bury her properly . He blamed the mine , the humming , dark , maddening tunnels . He blamed the managers , the vague sense of the mine 's white owners . <p> The doctor who operated on the crazed man to remove the bullet told Luc that his patient 's babbling had been a rant ending with , " It is alive . It breathes . It waits . " <p> So Luc carried a small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He knelt . He looked . He focused his laser flashlight on the wall in front of him . Someone had covered a four-foot section of the wall with dirt that almost matched the rest of the wall . Most people would n't have noticed . <p> Luc rubbed at the dirt-covered wall , took out a chemical spray , and washed a section . Even before the spray finished its work , Luc could see what had been hidden , a wooden panel about three-feet square . The panel had been carefully covered with chips of rock and dirt to simulate the surrounding wall . <p> Luc removed the panel and placed it against the tunnel wall . Then he shined his light inside a cave that extended about six feet into the rock . Luc crawled into the cave , coughed , and examined the walls around him . <p> He could see immediately . He needed no tests . An untrained eye would see nothing . Luc saw everything . He chipped away a small outcrop to his right , just above his head . Bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the rocky ore in his hand <p> and decided . It was , if he were not mistaken , a reasonably rich outcropping . <p> Considering the size of the cave and the quality of what he had in his hand , Luc concluded that someone had removed millions of rubles worth of uncut jewelry-quality diamonds from the  --  <p> Someone was singing . <p> Luc , still holding the rock sample , crawled back out of the small cave and took out his gun . He sat with his back against the tunnel wall and listened . <p> It sounded like the voice of a child , a child singing in Russian in a beautiful , clear voice that echoed sweetly through the tunnel , a funereal cathedral echo . <p> The voice was coming closer . <p> Luc got to his feet , dropped the rock into his case , and ripped the filter mask from his face . <p> The tunnel lights went out . <p> Luc was not a whimpering baby . He had served in the army , saw combat in Bosnia , had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games in the darkness . Fine , he would play too . <p> Luc turned on his flashlight and aimed it down the tunnel . The child 's voice came closer and Luc could see a flickering light heading toward him , casting shadows on the tunnel walls . <p> He waited , cursing his heavy breathing . <p> It was definitely the voice of a child , singing a Russian song he thought he had heard before . <p> " Who are you ? " he called out , his voice determined , strong , echoing . <p> The child kept singing . <p> Then she appeared . Alone . Small . Hair brushed down , dark , streaming over her shoulders and down the front of her white , white dress . In her left hand was a lamp , an old oil mining lamp , a kind that , Luc was certain , had never been used down here . <p> The child stopped . She was no longer singing . <p> Luc could see no one behind her . <p> The diamond thieves probably thought he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there had to be adults not far behind her . He could simply walk past her , gun in hand , at the ready , and make his way back down the tunnel . <p> Did they know he had a gun ? <p> Did they know he had found the small cave ? <p> And where the hell was Boris ? <p> The child smiled at him showing unexpectedly clean and even small white teeth . Russians did not have clean , even white teeth , not even the children . <p> Luc inched his way along the wall looking for trouble , ready for trouble , deciding not to send a warning shot into the darkness , deciding not to let them know he had a gun . <p> He was even with the child now . She had watched him move along the wall , scraping his head on the jagged rocky surface . She could n't have been more than ten or eleven years old . The light from the lamp in her hand cast shadows on her face , her eyes showing clear and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A sound down the shaft . Luc turned his flashlight toward it . There was nothing there . He sensed a scuffling , turned the light back to where the girl had been standing . She was gone . He aimed the beam toward the cave he had uncovered . The girl was standing before it , her lamp now held low . The shadows had turned her face hooded and skull- like . <p> Luc was afraid , undecided . Should he leave her and run ? Should he shoot her ? Should he take her hand and lead her out of <p> the darkness ? <p> No . He could n't bring himself to touch her . <p> The hell with it . He hoped he had enough bullets for whoever was waiting in the black oblivion . He turned his back on the girl , aimed his flashlight toward wherever disaster was lurking , and took a step . <p> Behind him the girl started to sing again . <p> It struck him in the dark of a diamond mine in Siberia that he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever would . <p> Excerpted from People Who Walk in Darkness by Stuart M.
