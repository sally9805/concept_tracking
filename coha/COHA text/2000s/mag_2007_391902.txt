In 1799 , French soldiers trudged south along the Nile , dispatched by the Emperor Napoleon to secure Upper Egypt . With them were artists , engineers , and scientists , commissioned to sketch and record everything they saw . On January 27 , they caught their first , stunning glimpse of Karnak , rising defiant from the sands . " Without an order being given , " wrote one lieutenant , " the men formed their ranks and presented arms , to the accompaniment of the drums and the bands . " Karnak 's awe-inspiring power is timeless , a tribute to those who built and understood it as the sacred home of the gods . Perhaps the largest religious complex ever constructed , Karnak was called Ipet Isut , " the most select of places . " Over the course of two millenniums , it was enlarged and enriched by consecutive pharaohs until it comprised 247 acres on the Nile 's east bank . Centered on the Temple of Amun ( begun in the 11th dynasty , 2134-1991 B.C. ) , it was more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's precincts were administrative offices , treasuries , palaces , bakeries , breweries , granaries , and schools . Supported by the revenue from royal land endowments , Karnak was an economic power . When Ramses III reigned ( 1194-1163 B.C. ) , the " domain of Amun " covered 900 square miles of agricultural land , vineyards , and marshlands , in addition to quarries and mines . Nexus . Amun 's temple was probably built on a pre-existing sacred mound , like the one that rose from the primordial sea , according to creation myths . Egyptian temples embodied this cosmology : The ceiling was heaven ; the floor , the fertile marsh from which life emerged . The pylons at the temple 's entrance were shaped like the hieroglyph for " horizon , " and the whole edifice , like the horizon , was the nexus of heaven and earth , divine and mortal , order and chaos . The temple held these polarities together ; so long as the rites were enacted by the pharaoh  --  the son of God  --  harmony and balance were maintained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism for renewal , the concept on which Egyptian civilization was largely based . As Richard H. Wilkinson writes in The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt , " symbol and ritual together propelled the temple and thus the world through the continuum of time and created , as much as they marked , the passage of days , months , seasons and years . " The year , separated into seasons of inundation , growth , and harvest , reflected the intimate rapport with nature that characterized Egyptian beliefs . The ancients nonetheless accepted that even the gods must one day die , returning the world to its chaotic origins . The observance of sacred ritual , as upheld in the temples , could forestall that time and hold the past , present , and future in equilibrium . The temple sanctuary , like the primeval mound , was elevated . In this most sacred room , accessible only to the pharaoh and the highest-ranking priests , the gold- and jewel-encrusted god was housed . But during two annual festivals , he left the temple to visit the people and fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A processional avenue of ram-headed sphinxes linked Karnak to Luxor temple , a few miles to the south . Along the way , the priests rested at chapels where musicians and acrobats provided entertainment . The ritual offering of flowers , associated with regeneration , intensified during feasts , and people presented them in holders shaped like the ankh , the hieroglyph for " life . " Festival attendees scraped dust from the temple walls for healing and devotion , a practice that still exists with a slight variation , says Salima Ikram , professor of Egyptology at Cairo 's American University . " Men drink their temple scrapings in tea to become more potent  --  early Viagra ! " she notes , adding that women circle the stone scarab near Karnak 's sacred lake seven times as a fertility charm . These " survivals , " contiguous traditions dating to antiquity , are reflected in the Coptic calendar that still guides farmers and in Egyptian Arabic where traces of the old language remain . Egypt 's ancient temples , its " houses of eternity , " became a symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the greatest empires one day fall .
