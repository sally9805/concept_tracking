You do n't have to be a commodities trader to worry about West Texas crude . Most of us know the price of gasoline to the penny , and it 's starting to really pinch . President Bush made the rising price of oil a focus of his prime-time news conference last week . But as Bush has acknowledged , lowering the price of oil is n't that easy . " You ca n't wave a magic wand , " he said . Oil , unlike other products and services that are manufactured and sold , obeys the laws of geology , not just supply and demand . " You do n't make more oil , " says Sam Shelton , director of the Strategic Energy Initiative at Georgia Tech in Atlanta . The world has to work with what it has . TIME 's Jyoti Thottam explains : <P> Is the world running out of oil ? <P> No , but that does n't mean we 're off the hook . " There is enough oil , but most of the easy oil , the cheap oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief economist at Standard &; Poor 's . Energy experts obsess over whether we 've reached " Hubbert 's peak , " the point at which oil reserves are 50% depleted . That 's because the remaining 50% gets increasingly harder and more expensive to extract . At some point in the next decade or so  --  estimates range from 15 to 25 years  --  the world 's oil production will peak . Yet demand for oil will continue to rise , increasing 50% over the next 50 years . <P> So , cheap oil is now just part of history ? <P> Correct . " Oil prices have moved to a higher level , and they 're going to stay there , " says Wyss . Expect crude to remain around $50 a barrel , while gasoline could reach $5 a gallon within the next few years . There will always be blips in both directions . A hard landing for the Chinese real estate market , for example , could stall growth and cause a sudden drop in oil prices . " People would be terrified by such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities investor . " But it would n't last . " Politics can also create short-term volatility : trouble in Saudi Arabia or political instability in Venezuela , Russia or Iran would cause price fluctuations . So could speculators . Last week 's $5-a-barrel price dip came thanks to profit taking in the market . " Hedge funds have been bailing out of their positions , " says Bill Greehey , CEO of oil refiner Valero Energy . " You 've got a lot of hot money . " <P> Will other sources of energy , like wind power or nuclear power , save the day ? <P> Only if they replace oil consumption . Building nuclear plants or wind farms to produce electricity , for example , wo n't add a barrel of oil to the world 's supply because we generally do n't use oil for electricity . Most electric-power plants run on coal or natural gas , another fossil fuel that will eventually peak , although later than oil will . Building more terminals to receive liquefied natural gas , as Bush has suggested , simply makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An adviser to Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Abdullah blamed high gas prices partly on the lack of U.S. refinery capacity . Are the Saudis correct ?
