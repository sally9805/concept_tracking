Breathe in . Hold it . Hold it . O.K. , now breathe out . <P> Unless you 're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap , chances are you ca n't see your breath . And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin box for the right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs . Yet last November , Murphy Oil Corp. , based in El Dorado , Ark. , voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide , the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago . <P> The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that same autumn day , half a world away , at the Hague . Thousands of policymakers and scientists from all over the world had gathered , hoping to dot the i 's , cross the zeds and umlaut the o 's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N . Framework Convention on Climate Change . The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission of six gases , CO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geological terms  --  turning the earth into a hothouse . But no final accord was reached . <P> In this context , Murphy 's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of carbon ( the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars ) from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd . The market for this kind of trade has n't been established , and there is n't even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued . Indeed there is n't even unanimity on global warming itself . <P> Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an environmental transition . Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord , and global bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions trading system . But corporations , against the run of play , are beginning to confront the climate conundrum the best way they know how  --  as a business opportunity . John Browne , CEO of BP Amoco , and Mark Moody-Stuart , chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group , have both responded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals put forth in Kyoto . Shell and BP have vowed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each  --  nearly twice the Kyoto target  --  Shell by 2002 , BP by 2010 . " This is n't an act of altruism , " says Aidan Murphy of Shell . " It 's a fundamental strategic issue for our business . " <P> And not theirs alone . A growing number of corporations , from IBM to your neighborhood Kinko 's , are reducing their greenhouse footprints . DuPont is pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010 . " There 's been a shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since Kyoto , " says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists . " Now the view is that climate change is serious and we ought to do something about it . " <P> There are a few ways of doing that : invest in renewable energy sources and " cap and trade " emissions . That is , set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas emission and let nations either sell emission credits if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed permitted levels . The theory is that the pursuit of greenbacks will fuel greener business . " Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset , " says Joseph Goffman , an attorney at Environmental Defense , " people go out and make lots of pollution cuts . "
