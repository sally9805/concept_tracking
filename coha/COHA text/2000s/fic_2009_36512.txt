one <p> She 'd been away for just a few days when a biology substitute told my class the most important and wonderful piece of information I 'd ever heard . <p> And then he was pulled out of the classroom forever . <p> Before this , Mr. Rice had been invisible . The blazers he wore to Peninsula Upper School  --  one of the finest schools in the Brooklyn Heights-to-Park Slope radius , to quote the promotional materials  --  were never wrinkled , and he always combed his thin , wheat-colored hair into wet-looking lines . There was nothing extracurricular in any of his previous lessons , and with his droning monotone , he made the processes of cell division and photosynthesis and the intricate innards of a paramecium seem far less fascinating than they truly were . But on this particular day , Mr. Rice drew a double helix on the board , tapped it with his piece of chalk , and said , " Everyone , this is what your whole life is all about . It 's all you need to know about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes up everything inside of you , " he boomed . " It determines what you look like and how you think , if you 're going to get sick and whether you 're smart or stupid . All you need to know about yourself is right here in this little molecule . Everything about your future , everything about your past . Nothing else matters , and you ca n't change it . It 's passed down , directly , from your parents . You ca n't escape your parents and your parents ca n't escape you , as hard as either of you might try . You 're tethered to them for life . " <p> Everyone murmured . Jennifer Lake raised her hand , then put it back down quickly . " Even the DNA that may not code for anything , " Mr. Rice went on , his voice swooping up and down , the way a hawk climbs and dives . " The stuff that 's called junk DNA . It does code for something  --  something huge . It codes for the secrets , stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code , we 'll have the answers to everything , but right now I think the only beings that understand junk DNA 's secrets are the aliens . " <p> Mr. Rice turned and drew a dish-shaped spaceship on the board . An eggplant-headed alien peeked out the top , and Mr. Rice etched a dotted line beaming right to the helix of DNA . The sweat on his forehead reminded me of the beads of water that gathered on the outside of a plastic bottle on a hot day . A couple of boys at the back coughed insults into their fists . But Mr. Rice 's words echoed in my mind . This is what your whole life is about . You ca n't escape your parents and your parents ca n't escape you . <p> Before this , our school 's principal had missed every other instance of unorthodox teaching , so it was something of a surprise when his face appeared outside the classroom door . Then there was a knock . " Everything okay , Mr. Rice ? " He stuck his head in . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I stared at the spaceship , too . There were so many things I worried about . I 'd always been a worrier  --  my father said worrying was in our blood . Just one week before , one of my most pressing worries had been that I would drop my set of keys to the apartment onto the subway tracks . I was so obsessed with the precarious danger of it , I flirted with the idea of pitching the keys down there willingly , just to know what would happen . But if I did , I would have to sit on the stoop in front of our apartment building , keyless , until my mother returned home from work . I did n't want to imagine what she would say , the pinched , disappointed shape her face would take . <p> I used to worry about the lone gray hairs I often saw sprouting from my mother 's head , terrified that she was showing signs of advanced and debilitating age . When she started to shut herself in the bathroom for hours at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was hiding a horrible sickness from the rest of us . I pictured a devastating disease ripping her apart , her skin peeling off in curls , her heart blackening . When we received a catalogue from the Vitamin Shoppe in the mail , I put it by her plate at breakfast , convinced its glossy pages contained a miracle pill . But she pushed the catalogue aside . My father absently flipped through it instead , commenting on the high price of spirulina tablets and chromium picolinate diet pills . In all my what-if scenarios , I never envisioned my father physically ill . The dark hours he spent under the covers were due to something different , not sickness . <p> What had happened to my family a few days before this was something else entirely  --  something far bigger than anything I 'd even dared to consider . But Mr. Rice 's words made me think that maybe I did n't have to worry about it after all . <p> The substitute 's shoulders slumped as he walked into the hall with the principal . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorted . " What a loser . " Someone threw a balled-up piece of notebook paper at the alien spaceship . One by one , like dominoes falling over , everyone began to talk , to forget . I was the only one who did n't laugh . <br> <p> The following day , when my father told me that Claire Ryan and her mother were coming over to visit in a few minutes , I was struck dumb . Just because I was friends with someone a couple years ago did n't mean we liked each other now . I thought my father understood this . <p> " Claire ? " I shrieked . " Are you sure ? Why ? " <p> " Her mother wants to talk to me , that 's why , " my father explained . " And she 's bringing Claire because she thought it would be nice for you two to see each other again . " <p> The doorbell rang . I looked at my father . He was wearing plaid slippers and had the same Pfizer T-shirt he 'd been wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace , empty soda bottles on the coffee table , and a crooked , undecorated Christmas tree in the corner , needles all over the floor . It was amazing how messy things could get in just two weeks . <p> When my father opened the door , Mrs. Ryan looked right  --  perhaps a bit thinner , a little ragged , her blond hair not as smoothly blow-dried as it used to be  --  but Claire was different entirely . Her eyes were the same , those blue-green eyes everyone used to be so jealous of . As was her thick blond hair , the hair she used to toss over her shoulder so effortlessly , and her pretty , bow-shaped mouth , the mouth every boy wanted to kiss . But her cheeks were puffy . The rest of her body was , too . <p> I could n't stop staring . Look at the way her T-shirt clung to her arms ! Look at the pink flesh around her neck ! I actually gasped , although I tried to pass it off as a hiccup , hitting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esophagus . Everyone knew Claire was back from Paris and her parents were divorcing , but no one knew this . <p> Mrs. Ryan looked at me . " Hi , Summer . It 's so nice to see you again . " <p> She pushed Claire forward . " Say hi , Claire . " <p> " Hi , " Claire mumbled . <p> " How was France ? " my father cried . " You two look great . Very European . " <p> He did n't even notice how different Claire looked . My mother would n't miss something like this . <p> My father asked me to take Claire to the roof to show her the view of the city , as if Claire had n't seen it thousands of times before . Although her view was n't from this side of the river anymore  --  what everyone also knew was that Mr. Ryan was retaining his apartment on Pineapple Street in Brooklyn Heights , near us , and Mrs. Ryan and Claire were renting a place in a mysterious Manhattan neighborhood called Alphabet City . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shooing motion with his hands . <p> When we reached the roof , Claire looked at the buildings across the East River . Back when we hung out a lot , we had names for each of the buildings we could see from my apartment  --  the tall pointy one was Lester , the squat one on the harbor was Boris , and the Twin Towers were Scooby-Doo and Shaggy , the only two characters on the show worth caring about . I glanced at Scooby-Doo  --  One World Trade  --  and counted twenty-two flights from the top and three windows over . My mother 's office . I 'd never been inside it , but I was certain there was an official-looking name plaque on her desk , Meredith Heller-Davis . The room was still dark . I squinted hard , willing the light to come on . <p> Claire ran her finger along the edge of the charcoal grill . There was rust on it , but we used to cook out on the roof a lot . All four of us , my mother , father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here and point at the boats and buildings and eat hamburgers . My father used to bring up a boom box and put on a bunch of old jazz tapes , even though my mother preferred music that , as she put it , " actually made sense . " When it was time to eat , my dad turned his back and whipped up a condiment that he said was his Aunt Stella 's Famous Special Sauce . Once , I remarked that it tasted like nothing but mayo and ketchup mixed , and my mother snorted . " Stella probably got the idea from Burger King , " she said with a laugh . My father chewed his burger . " Stella 's a good woman , " he said stiffly , not that it was in question . <p> Later , my mother and I would watch the boats on the East River through binoculars , making up stories about some of the yachters . The man in the sailboat named Miss Isabelle still lived on his parents ' estate . The man in the yacht with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long plastic wand used to separate one person 's groceries from another on the belt  --  how else could a man with such a tacky comb-over own a boat that big ? When it was Steven 's turn with the binoculars , he always aimed them at the buildings across the water , watching the people still in their offices , working . " What do you think they 're doing in there ? " he asked out loud on more than one occasion . " I bet they 're doing math , " my mother or I always suggested , struggling to remain straight-faced . Steven 's love of math was an ongoing joke between my mother and me ; we were convinced that he slept with his graphing calculator under his pillow . <p> Claire 's belt was fastened on the very largest notch . " So my new neighborhood is weird , " she informed me , as if we 'd been talking every day . As if I knew everything about her  --  which I kind of did . " Last night , I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you know ? " <p> " I looked at his arms . " <p> I 'd never been to her new neighborhood before , this mythical Alphabet City . When kids at our school traveled into Manhattan , they went to Soho to shop , or to the Upper East or West Sides to visit grandparents . No one ventured into the East Village , and definitely not to the avenues with the letters . <p> The Staten Island ferry chugged away from the west side of the island , spewing a contrast of black oil and crisp white waves behind it . " So . " Claire tapped the top of the grill . " What 's new with you ? " <p> " Not much . " I kept my eyes on the ferry . " Same old , same old . " <p> Claire curled her hand around a rusted spatula . " I heard about your mom . " <p> A hot fist knotted in my throat . What did everyone know about my family ? <p> Before I could reply , a noise interrupted us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father followed . " Time to go , " Mrs. Ryan announced . <p> Claire crossed her arms over her chest . " We just got here . " <p> Mrs. Ryan gave her a tight smile . " We have a lot of things to do today . " <p> " You have a lot of things to do . I do n't . " <p> " Well , you have to come with me . " Mrs. Ryan 's expression did n't falter . <p> " I can ride the train by myself . " <p> " Seriously . Time to go . " <p> Claire put her head down . " Fuck off . " <p> My father 's eyes widened . Mine did , too . I 'd never heard Claire swear . <p> Mrs. Ryan swallowed , then stood up straighter . " Fine . " She turned around stiffly and started back down the stairs . My dad and I stood there , waiting to see if Claire would move . She did n't . My father looked blank . He was n't good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Unbelievable , " she eventually said , and stood up . The doorway down from the roof to our apartment suddenly looked too narrow for her to fit through . <p> My father and I walked them to the door . We watched them out the window as they marched toward the subway , not talking , not touching . The wind blew , shaking the plastic bags caught in the trees . <p> " Did Claire ask you anything about it ? " my father murmured out of the corner of his mouth . <p> I shrugged . " It 's none of her business . " Or yours , I wanted to add . <p> " Claire 's your best friend . " <p> " Was . Two years ago . For like a second . " <p> He jingled loose change in his pockets . " It 's okay to talk about it , you know . " <p> " I do n't need to talk about it . There 's nothing to talk about . " <p> He looked at me desperately . The jingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . <p> He pressed his thumbs into his eye sockets , breathed out through his mouth , and made a funny choooo noise , like a train pulling into the last station stop and easing on its brakes . Then he patted my arm , sighed , and went into the kitchen to turn on the TV . <br> <p> Claire was born one year , one month , and one day before I was . When we were friends for like a second two summers ago , she liked to remind me of this when she held me down and tickled me : " I am one year , one month , and one day older than you , " she would say , " so I have full tickling privileges . " <p> She was going into ninth grade and I was going into eighth . We were forced to be around each other a lot that summer because our mothers , who both worked in the events department of Mandrake &amp; Hester , a high-end private bank , had become best friends and rented a share on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I panicked . Spend eight weeks at the beach with a girl I did n't know ? I did n't even like the ocean . And I was n't very comfortable with strangers . <p> My mother wanted me to like Claire  --  and even more , for Claire to like me  --  and at the beach , it did n't seem that hard . Claire 's long , ash-blond hair became knotted and caked with sand , and her full , pretty lips were constantly coated with zinc . She wore ratty T-shirts and cutoffs , and she roughhoused , tackling me into the surf . She indulged my need to spy on our mothers , who liked to sunbathe on the beach and read magazines . We had a foolproof system : the lifeguard stand was on a mound by the dunes , and all we had to do was duck behind where the lifeguards hung their towels and our mothers had no idea we were there . They talked about chauvinistic men at the office , places they wished they could visit , the new male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if my mother would talk about me  --  maybe in a bragging way , hopefully not in an irritated way  --  but she never did . <p> In July , our mothers signed us up to be junior counselors at the town 's day camp . Claire was the only person I spoke to and who spoke to me . Everyone loved Claire , though . She could play the guitar , beat anyone in a race across the sand , and she petitioned the camp to let us build a twenty-person ice-cream sundae , exhausting the kitchen 's supplies . Three different junior counselor boys had a crush on her , and kids followed her around as if she were made of cake icing . <p> That fall , I switched from St. Martha 's , a private Catholic school in Brooklyn Heights , to Peninsula Upper School , where Claire went . Claire was the only person I knew who went there , but I certainly did n't know who Claire was . If I had , I would n't have acted so juvenile around her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played Monopoly , constantly playing the beach house 's Nintendo even though I barely touched our console at home . And I certainly would n't have done that dance when I won the Mega Man Six tournament , the finale of which involved flashing Claire my pink bubble-printed underwear . <p> On September 3 , I barely noticed a tall , beautiful blond girl climb aboard the school bus . " Get your butt over here ! " a guy at the back of the bus screamed at her . Other guys made whoo ing noises . " Where 've you been all summer , Claire ? " a girl cried . <p> Claire ? I started up , alarmed . The blond girl in the pink shirt and form-fitted jeans took off her pale sunglasses . There were those familiar blue-green eyes , that lush , pink mouth , but her hair was so smooth , her clothes so brand-new . She whipped her head around , as if looking for someone . I slumped down in the seat and pretended to be fascinated by my lunch , a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch bag , a smushed PB&amp;J crammed into a Ziploc . Finally , Claire walked to the back and fell into a seat with one of the girls . <p> " Anyone sitting here ? " asked an Indian boy who I would later learn was named Vishal . My hand was still saving the empty seat next to the aisle for Claire . I curled it away into my lap and squeezed myself as close to the window as I could . <p> When the bus pulled up to our school on Lincoln Street , I stood up , but Vishal grabbed my sleeve . " I think we 're supposed to let them off first , " he said , in his loopy I-didn't-grow-up-here accent . And there they came , Claire among them , shoving each other and laughing , all of them with clear skin and hiking backpacks even though there was nowhere around to hike . <p> Claire noticed me cowering behind Vishal . " Summer ! " She stopped short , holding up the line in back of her . " When did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said quietly . " I got on before you . " <p> " Claire , c'm on ! " A girl behind her shoved her playfully . <p> But Claire did n't move . " I did n't see you . " She seemed honestly sad . <p> " I was here . " My voice sounded pathetic . Claire noticed , too ; her lip stuck out in a pout . <p> The next day , she made a big point to sit with me on the bus . The day after that , too . The whole time , she was up on her knees facing the back of the bus , laughing with them . " Just go back there , " I said on the third day , pressing my body against the cold , drafty window , my knees curled up to my stomach because I 'd stupidly chosen the bus seat above the wheel . <p> " No , it 's okay . " Claire moved her knees to the front . " So what 's been going on with you ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easy to find your way around ? " <p> " I 'm busy reading this , " I snapped , staring at the oral report schedule for my American history class . I was to give a report about the Gettysburg Address on November 14 , more than two months away . <p> " Summer . " Claire wore shiny lip gloss . Her earrings were dangling silver pears . <p> " Just go . " <p> Claire shrugged , then monkey-barred from seat to seat , listing sideways when the bus went over bumps . Maybe I should 've told her to stay and sit with me . Maybe I should 've asked why she had n't suggested that we both go back and sit with them . But I was afraid what the answer might be  --  what fatal flaw of mine prevented her from introducing me around . I told myself I was being charitable , a real friend , letting her go off there alone . I 'd given her a gift . <p> By the time the end of the year rolled around , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all she might say was , " Steal any Monopoly money lately ? " I hated her by then . I 'd begun to blame Claire for everything that was going wrong : That , two weeks before , I had woken up and realized I 'd peed in the bed . That a window in our front room had been broken , and my father asked my mother to call to have it replaced but she argued that he had fingers , he could call to have it replaced , and it still was n't replaced because they were at some sort of standoff , and there was still a huge crack in the window , sloppily sealed up with duct tape . That I would probably die an old maid without ever kissing a boy . That my father had begun to spend whole Saturdays in bed , and that my mother did n't take me shopping anymore . <p> One late May afternoon , I was in keyboarding class , typing line after line of the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy sleeping dog . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire Ryan is moving to France , " one whispered to the other . " They 're taking the Concorde . " <p> I typed a whole line of nonsense so it seemed like I was n't listening . France ? <p> I found out later  --  not from Claire  --  that her father had taken a position at his company 's Paris office . They had rented a three-bedroom apartment in someplace called Montmartre . I wanted to ask Claire about it , or wish her well , or tell her good riddance , but so many people always surrounded her , all the way up to the very end , that I never had the chance . <p> The excited chatter that Claire was returning from France started a few weeks ago . Claire had n't told anyone the news herself , but someone 's father worked with Mr. Ryan and had found out the details . Claire would be attending Peninsula again , but she would be in tenth grade with me , not eleventh . People nudged Devon Reyes , Claire 's old boyfriend , saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country that was so obsessed and open about sex . And me ? I did n't have any reaction to the news , and no one asked me for comment . The time we were friends felt as far away as my birth . <p> But it surprised me that Mr. and Mrs. Ryan were getting a divorce  --  Claire had never seemed worried about her parents ' marriage . After Mrs. Ryan and Claire left our apartment , I followed my father into the kitchen . " Perhaps Mrs. Ryan just needs a private vacation , " I called out to him , as if we 'd been dissecting the Ryans ' divorce for hours . " You know , some time to herself . And then , after a while , she 'll move back into the Pineapple Street apartment , and everything will be fine . It 's probably what all couples need , I bet . " <p> My father looked at me for a long time . His eyes were watery . " Maybe , " he said , eating from a bag of pretzels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to laugh , but it came out as more of a sniffle.Copyright 2009 by Sara Shepard <br> Continues ...
