If a flood of Biblical proportions were to lay waste to New Orleans , Joe Suhayda has a good idea how it would happen . A Category 5 hurricane would come barreling out of the Gulf of Mexico . It would cause Lake Pontchartrain , north of New Orleans , to overflow , pouring down millions of gallons of water on the city . Then things would really get ugly . Evacuation routes would be blocked . Buildings would collapse . Chemicals and hazardous waste would dissolve , turning the floodwaters into a lethal soup . In the end , what was left of the city might not be worth saving . " There 's concern it would essentially destroy New Orleans , " says Suhayda . <P> Suhayda , a water-resources expert at Louisiana State University , is the kind of guy who could have given Noah a computer model of all 40 days and 40 nights of rain , including the Ark 's soft landing on Mount Ararat . So it is real cause for concern that he has joined the chorus of scientists and environmentalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extreme  --  that in the worst-case scenario , in fact , there might not be a city of New Orleans left standing by the end of the century . <P> New Orleans has always had a complicated relationship with the water surrounding it . Everyone told the first settlers this was the wrong place to build a city . It is wedged precariously between the mighty Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain , and most of it was once swampland . Aggravating the problem is the fact that much of New Orleans is below sea level , so that after a good rain , the water just settles in . There is now a decent pumping system , which helps . Old-timers , however , still talk of the days when , after a bad storm , bodies washed out of the cemeteries . <P> What is threatening New Orleans is a combination of two man-made problems : more levees and fewer wetlands . The levees installed along the Mississippi to protect the city from water surges have had a perverse effect : they have actually made it more vulnerable to flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by the precarious balance of two opposing forces . Because the city is constructed on 100 feet of soft silt , sand and clay , it naturally " subsides , " or sinks , several feet a century . Historically , that subsidence has been counteracted by sedimentation : new silt , sand and clay that are deposited when the river floods . But since the levees went up  --  mostly after the great flood of 1927  --  the river has not been flooding , and sedimentation has stopped . <P> The upshot is that New Orleans has been sinking as much as 3 ft. a century . That 's bad news for a city that is already an average of 8 ft. below sea level . Making things worse : sea levels worldwide are rising as much as 3 ft. a century on account of global warming . The lower New Orleans plunges , the worse it will be when the big one hits . <P> New Orleans ' other major man-made problem is that its wetlands and its low-lying barrier islands are disappearing . The Louisiana coast is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of population expansion into once pristine areas , destructive oil and gas drilling , pollution and land loss through lack of sedimentation . As it turns out , wetlands and barrier islands are n't just nice to look at ; they are also a key natural barrier to hurricanes . ( Every 2.7 miles of wetland absorbs a foot of storm surge . ) As the wetlands go , the chance of a hurricane blowing the city away grows .
