Even before he is brought to trial , there was justice in the news that Saddam Hussein had survived by being buried alive . Like a pharaoh in his tomb , he had surrounded himself with symbols of his lost power  --  two AK-47s , a pistol , $750,000 in $100 bills . The Butcher of Baghdad was nestled underground with pictures of Ben Franklin . The hunt for Saddam that began with a hellfire of bombs eight months ago ended without a shot being fired . It was soldiers from the Raider Brigade of the Army 's 4th Infantry Division who dug him out of the 8ft. - deep spider hole ; the palace monster of monuments and torture chambers had been reduced to the life of a bug . His captors picked through his shaggy hair , the raccoon beard . They scraped his throat , checked his teeth . " Merry Christmas , " said the soldiers to one another , and they lit cigars and took pictures and smiled . <P> It was a relief to see him made small enough to handcuff because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring peace to a haunted house . Bribes and threats and rockets and satellites had failed to find him , even with the world 's mightiest army conducting the manhunt . The President had stopped talking about him , as if he were superstitious or trying to change the subject . People bought Saddam golf balls , Saddam pinatas , voodoo dolls , to satisfy the need to hit back and not feel helpless every time he taunted his hunters with a new videotape to rally his followers , every time we heard of a new ambush conducted in his name . <P> With his capture , we exhale , after a long , deep breath we have held for a year . We can measure the meaning of his capture by the measures we have taken  --  old alliances and long traditions discarded to go to war to take him out and , in the name of democracy , a war that was opposed by vast majorities in most democracies on earth . Hundreds of soldiers killed , hundreds more wounded , $4 billion a month spent and billions more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be helping rebuild for years to come . And so what is the gift this capture has bought ? Perhaps a true taste of freedom from fear for 25 million people who could never quite have faith that the tyranny was over while the tyrant was still loose . It was an antidote to the contempt expressed by Arab and European commentators who poked the American tiger : See , you ca n't even catch Saddam . " This is very good news for the people of Iraq , " British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Sunday . " It removes the shadow that has been hanging over them for too long of the nightmare of a return to the Saddam regime . This fear is now removed . " Other implications of Saddam 's capture are less clear . Will it encourage Bush to reach out to other European allies to help in the policing and reconstruction of Iraq , or will he be encouraged to stick to his current course ? And how will this victory affect Bush 's re-election campaign in 2004  --  and , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates , including front runner Howard Dean , who want to replace him ?
