wellness Headnote Mind your migraines with natural remedies Photograph // Sarah Smith , a 54-year old marketing consultant in San Rafael , California , had " tried every prescription medicine on the market " for her migraines , but they kept coming back , marked by the typical symptoms-blurred vision , detection of a pungent odor and , finally , a throbbing pain in her head . " I was at the point where the pain had me almost literally down on my hands and knees-ready to try anything , " Smith says . She finally turned to herbal medicine . Alternative treatments may provide relief for many of the millions who suffer from migraines . A 2001 survey of 223 professional complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) organizations conducted by the Department of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom reported that migraines were extremely responsive to alternative therapies such as massage , nutritional changes , chiropractic care , aromatherapy and biofeedback . And CAM therapies do n't have the unpleasant side effects of pharmaceuticals . " If you use medicine more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may result in " rebound " headaches-headaches that occur as the medication wears off , " adds Steven Graff-Radford , DDS , co-director of the Los Angeles-based Pain Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . Migraines affect 28 million Americans in the United States , a majority of whom are women , according to Graff-Radford . " Women are more susceptible to certain kinds of pain , such as migraines , simply because of the presence of estrogen in their bodies , " he says . In recent years , researchers have evolved their theories on how migraines develop . The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke says investigators initially thought dilation and constriction of blood vessels in the head caused migraines . Now , the Institute says , research has found a migraine pain center located in the brain stem . " Activation of the brain stem , " says Graff-Radford , " causes a release of neuro-inflammatory agents that surround the blood vessels in the brain , " causing pain . Specific abnormal genes have been identified for some forms of migraine . Migraines-which can be triggered by diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormonal fluctuations-can be treated through a variety of natural methods . Some therapies that work without medication are nutrition changes and herbal remedies . Herbal Options Many herbs can be useful for migraine sufferers . Feverfew , from the Latin for " chase away fevers , " has been used for centuries in Europe for easing migraine attacks . A naturally occurring chemical in the herb , parthenolide , boasts anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce the severity of migraines . Modern clinical studies  --  such as a 2001 Yale University study-confirm feverfew 's effectiveness , and Graff-Radford 's patients have reported equal success . When Smith turned to herbal medicine four years ago , she tried feverfew . After a few weeks of using it  --  which can be ingested in fresh leaf , pill or powder form-the frequency of her migraines subsided significantly . Today , she takes feverfew only when she feels a migraine coming on . Photograph // Other helpful herbs for migraines include ginkgo , ginger , kava kava , valerian or chamomile . Ginkgo helps increase circulation in the brain . Ginger inhibits platelet aggregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useful for migraines located in the forehead area . Kava kava and valerian help you relax and reduce the effects of stress , which can exacerbate a migraine . And chamomile tea can help ease tension , a common trigger for migraines . Nutrition Dietary changes may help alleviate migraines caused by food allergies and other nutrition triggers . Jani Osborne , MS , a nutrition consultant in San Francisco , says , " Consider keeping a diary . Each time a migraine occurs , note which foods you have been eating , your location , your activity and your emotions . In time you may find the diary helps you pinpoint your specific group of triggers . " Graff-Radford recommends five dietary changes to reduce the frequency or intensity of migraines . First , eliminate caffeine . When caffeine is withdrawn from the diet , most migraine sufferers experience relief . Ironically , " If you are caffeine-free , taking caffeine at the onset of a migraine can actually switch off the headache , " says Graff-Radford . Erin Thompson , a doctoral student in Berkeley , California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all I need to do when I feel a migraine come on is consume a little bit of caffeine . Even though I know it often aggravates other people 's migraines , it helps me manage mine , " she says . Second , nix aspartame , an artificial sweetener found in NutraSweet . Third , cut down on chocolate , which also contains caffeine . Fourth , eliminate foods containing tyramine-an amino acid that has been linked to migraines-such as sharp cheeses and nuts . And finally , reduce alcohol intake . " Red wine in particular contains preservative sulfites , which have been connected to migraine pain , " says Graff-Radford . While there are no foods that cure migraines , milk can help manage them . Milk contains tryptophan , an amino acid that can increase the brain chemical serotonin . Increased serotonin may lessen the frequency of migraines . Tryptophan is also present in eggs and some nuts . Photograph Ease Pain with Yogic Aspirin Exercise is an excellent way to reduce tension . Some types of exercise can be more effective than others at calming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex interaction between the mind and body responses . " Yoga is an excellent exercise and therapy for people who suffer from chronic migraines , " says Sat Jivan Singh Khalsa , co-director of the Kundalini Yoga East center in New York City . All exercise is great for reducing daily tension and stress-which are often triggers for migraines-but yoga offers additional benefits . " Yoga makes you stop and breathe in a focused activity designed for you to make the mind/body connection . Contrary to popular belief , you do n't need to be a " pretzel " to realize the benefits . Yoga has the ability to free your mind , and most people with chronic migraines should notice results immediately , " says Khalsa . Khalsa describes migraines as " a restriction of blood flow , which yoga can help rebalance . " When you feel a migraine coming on , Khalsa suggests some popular yoga positions of varying difficulty to try to help release tension in the neck and shoulders and , thus , either prevent a migraine , if done early enough , or ease a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 to 3 minutes , and repeat if you can hold for only 1 minute . Try the Downward Dog ( which he calls the " most effective " position ) , the Elephant Walk ( also called Walking in Downward Dog ) and a shoulder stand . Khalsa also suggests that , while lying on your back with your body relaxed , you bring your chin as closely as you can to your chest and hold the position while practicing deep , relaxed breathing . This exercise can be also done in a sitting position but is not as effective as when you 're lying down . Another option to try is breathing through the left nostril while holding the right one closed , which causes a cooling , soothing breath-perfect for easing migraines. // Osborne says animal fats should be avoided because they produce arachidonic acid , which increases blood clotting . Alternatively , sources of omega-3 fatty acids  --  flaxseeds , pumpkin-seed oil , chia seeds and hempseeds-inhibit blood clotting . Graff-Radford suggests trying vitamin Bsub 2-riboflavin-to reduce the frequency of migraines . The B-complex vitamins help balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain products , beans , leafy greens , broccoli , peanuts , brewer 's yeast , chlorella or spirulina supplements , eggs and milk . Osborne says it is also important to include another B vitamin , niacin-which is present in raw wheat germ , whole-grain products and beans-because it helps to increase blood circulation . Foods rich in magnesium " may help relax muscles and balance the release of pain-producing chemicals , " says Osborne . Try to increase food sources of magnesium by eating kelp-an especially high source of the mineral-and tofu , beans , nuts , whole grains , blackstrap molasses and green leafy vegetables . " An alternative is to take 800 mg daily of a magnesium supplement . While no one knows exactly why it works , " magnesium may stabilize neural activities so we have less triggerability , " says Graff-Radford . Treating migraines with nutritional and herbal methods may be an important step in reducing the frequency or severity of migraines .

Migraines last between four and 72 hours and occur when two of four symptoms are present : nausea , sensitivity to light or noise and throbbing pain of moderate to severe intensity , aggravated by routine physical activities like walking up stairs.They can occur on both sides of the head , or they can be " unilateral , " experienced on one side of the head , which occurs in 60 percent of migraines .
