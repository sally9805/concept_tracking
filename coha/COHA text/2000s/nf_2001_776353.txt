A Small Archduchess // " Her Majesty has been very happily delivered of a small , but completely healthy Archduchess. " // Count Khevenhuller , Court Chamberlain , 1755 // On 2 November 1755 the Queen-Empress was in labour all day with her fifteenth child . Since the experience of childbirth was no novelty , and since Maria Teresa , Queen of Hungary by inheritance , Empress of the Holy Roman Empire by marriage , hated to waste time , she also laboured in another way at her papers . For the responsibilities of government were not to be lightly cast aside ; in her own words : " My subjects are my first children . " Finally , at about half past eight in the evening in her apartments at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna , Maria Teresa gave birth . It was a girl . Or , as the Court Chamberlain , Count Khevenhuller , described the event in his diary : " Her Majesty has been happily delivered of a small , but completely healthy Archduchess . " As soon as was practical , Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The announcement was made by the Emperor Francis Stephen . He left his wife 's bedroom , after the usual Te Deum and Benediction had been said . In the Mirror Room next door the ladies and gentlemen of the court who had the Rights of Entry were waiting . Maria Teresa had firmly ended the practice , so distasteful to the mother in labour ( but still in place at the court of Versailles ) , by which these courtiers were actually present in the delivery room . As it was they had to content themselves with congratulating the happy father . It was not until four days later that those ladies of the court who by etiquette would formerly have been in the bedchamber were allowed to kiss the Empress . Other courtiers , including Khevenhuller , were permitted the privilege on 8 November , and a further set the next day . Perhaps it was the small size of the baby , perhaps it was the therapeutic effect of working at her papers throughout the day , but Maria Teresa had never looked so well after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the first floor of the so-called Leopoldine wing of the extensive and rambling Hofburg complex . The Habsburgs had lived in the Hofburg since the late thirteenth century , but this wing had originally been constructed by the Emperor Leopold I in 1660 . It was rebuilt following a fire , then greatly renovated by Maria Teresa herself . It lay south-west of the internal courtyard known as In Der Burg . Swiss Guards , that doughty international force that protects royalty , gave their name to the adjacent courtyard and gate , the Schweizerhof and the Schweizertor. // The next stage in the new baby 's life was routine . She was handed over to an official wet-nurse . Great ladies did not nurse their own children . For one thing , breastfeeding was considered to ruin the shape of the bosom , made so visible by eighteenth-century fashions . The philandering Louis XV openly disliked the practice for this reason . The traditional prohibition against husbands sleeping with their wives during this period probably counted for more with Maria Teresa , an enthusiast for the marital double-bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever increasing numbers of babies . As the Empress said of herself , she was insatiable on the subject of children . // Marie Antoinette was put into the care of Constance Weber , wife of a magistrate . Constance , according to her son Joseph Weber , who later wrote his memoirs , was famed for her beautiful figure and an even greater beauty of soul . She had been nursing little Joseph for three months when she took over the baby Archduchess , and it was understood in the family that Constance 's appointment would improve all their fortunes . As the foster-brother of an archduchess , Joseph Weber benefited all his life ; there were pensions for Constance as well as his other brothers and sisters . During Marie Antoinette 's childhood , Maria Teresa took her to visit the Weber household ; there she showered gifts upon the children and , according to Joseph , admonished Constance : " Good Weber , have a care for your son .

The extraordinarily high survival rate of the imperial family  --  by the standards of infant mortality of the time  --  meant that there was no urgent pressure upon the Queen-Empress to produce a fifth son . In any case it seems that Maria Teresa had expected a daughter . One of her courtiers , Count Dietrichstein , wagered against her that the new baby would be a boy . When the appearance of a girl , said to be as like her mother as two drops of water , meant that he lost the bet , the Count had a small porcelain figure made of himself , on his knees , proffering verses by Metastasio to Maria Teresa . He may have lost his wager but if the new-born augusta figlia resembled her mother , then all the world would have gained . // If the birth of an eighth surviving daughter was not in itself a disappointment , was there not perhaps something inauspicious about the date itself , 2 November ? This , the Feast of All Souls , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed were solemnly commemorated in a series of requiem Masses , in churches and chapels heavily draped in black . What this actually meant during the childhood of Marie Antoinette was that her birthday was generally celebrated on its eve , the Feast of All Saints , a day of white and gold . Besides which , 13 June , the feast of her patron saint St. Antony , tended to be regarded as Marie Antoinette 's personal day of celebration , just as the feast of St. Teresa of Avila on 15 October was the name-day of her mother . // If one looks to influences , the baby born on the sombre Day of the Dead must have been conceived on or around a far more cheerful feast of the church : 2 February , the traditionally candle-lit celebration of the Purification of the Virgin Mary . An episode during the Empress 's pregnancy could also be seen as significant . In April , Christoph Willibald Gluck was engaged by Maria Teresa to compose " theatrical and chamber music " in exchange for an official salary ; this followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna . A court ball at the palace of Laxenburg , fifteen miles from Vienna , on 5 May 1755 , marked his inauguration in this role . Two tastes that would impress themselves upon Marie Antoinette  --  a love of the " holiday " palace of Laxenburg and a love of the music of Gluck  --  could literally be said to have been inculcated in her mother 's womb . // In contrast , the fact that a colossal earthquake took place in Lisbon on 2 November , with 30,000 killed , was not at the time seen as relevant . This was an age of poor European communications and news of the disaster did not reach Vienna until some time afterwards . It was true that the King of Portugal and his wife had been engaged to stand as the coming baby 's godparents ; the unfortunate royal couple had to flee from their capital at about the time Marie Antoinette was born . But , once again , this was not known at the time . In any case , royalties were not expected to be present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their absence : the baby 's eldest brother , Joseph , and her eldest sister , Marianne , aged fourteen and seventeen respectively . // The baptism took place at noon on 3 November ( baptisms were always held speedily and in the absence of the mother , who was allowed to recover from her ordeal ) . The Emperor went with a cortege to the Church of the Augustine Friars , the traditional church used by the court , and heard Mass , including the sermon . After that , at twelve o'clock , as Count Khevenhuller noted in his meticulous diary , which is an important source for our knowledge of events in Maria Teresa 's family , the baptism was held in " the new and beautiful Anticamera " and performed by " our Archbishop , " since the new Papal Nuncio had not yet made a formal appearance at court . The imperial family sat in a row on a long bench . Two galas were ordered : a great gala for the day of the baptism , and a lesser gala for the day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles that were shown to the public for free , and on those days there was no charge to the public for entry at the city gates . It was all a very well established ritual . // The baby in whose honour these celebrations were held was given the names Maria Antonia Josepha Joanna . The prefix of Maria had been established for all Habsburg princesses in the days of the baby 's great-grandfather , the Emperor Leopold I and his third wife Eleanora of Neuburg ; it was intended to signify the special veneration of the Habsburg family for the Virgin Mary . Obviously in a bevy of eight sisters ( and a mother ) all enjoying the same hallowed prefix , it was not going to be used for everyone all the time . In fact the new baby would be called Antoine in the family . // The French diminutive of the baptismal name , Antoine , was significant . Viennese society was multilingual , people being able to make themselves easily understood in Italian and Spanish as well as in German and French . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the universal language of courts throughout Europe ; Frederick II of Prussia , Maria Teresa 's great rival , for example , preferred his beloved French to German . It was French that was used in diplomatic despatches to the Habsburgs . Maria Teresa spoke French , although with a strong German accent ( she also spoke the Viennese dialect ) , but the Emperor Francis Stephen spoke French all his life , not caring to learn German . In this way , both in the family circle and outside it , Maria Antonia was quickly transmogrified into Antoine , the name she also used to sign her letters . To courtiers , the latest archduchess was to be known as Madame Antoine. // Charming , sophisticated , lazy and pleasure-loving , an inveterate womanizer who adored his wife and family , Francis Stephen of Lorraine handed on to Marie Antoinette a strong dose of French blood . His mother Elisabeth Charlotte d'Orleans had been a French royal princess and a granddaughter of Louis XIII . Her brother , the Duc d'Orleans , had acted as Regent during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he had Habsburg blood on his father 's side and was adopted into the Viennese court in 1723 at the age of fourteen , it was important to him that he was by birth a Lorrainer . From 1729 , when his father died , he was hereditary Duke of Lorraine , a title that stretched back to the time of Charlemagne . This notional Lorrainer inheritance would also feature in the consciousness of Marie Antoinette , even though Francis Stephen was obliged to surrender the actual duchy in 1735 . It was part of a complicated European deal whereby Louis XV 's father-in-law , who had been dispossessed as King of Poland , received the Duchy of Lorraine for the duration of his lifetime ; it then became part of the kingdom of France . In return Francis Stephen was awarded the Duchy of Tuscany . // The renunciation of his family heritage in order to soothe France was presented to Francis Stephen as part of a package that would enable him to marry Maria Teresa . On her side , it was a passionate love match . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sighs and pines all night for her Duke of Lorraine . If she sleeps , it is only to dream of him . If she wakes , it is but to talk of him to the lady-in-waiting . " Wilfully , in a way that would be in striking contradiction to the precepts she preached as a mother , Maria Teresa set her heart against a far grander suitor , the heir to the Spanish throne . The medal struck for the wedding bore the inscription ( in Latin ) : " Having at length the fruit of our desires . " // The desires in question , however , did not include the bridegroom 's continued enjoyment of his hereditary possessions . As his future father-in-law Charles VI crudely put it : " No renunciation , no Archduchess . " Maria Teresa of course believed in total wifely submission , at least in theory , another doctrine that she would expound assiduously to her daughters . Her solution was to tolerate and even encourage her husband 's Lorrainer relations at court , as well as a multitude of Lorrainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Francis Stephen 's younger brother Charles of Lorraine strengthened these ties ; Marianna 's early death left Maria Teresa with a sentimental devotion to her widower . Then there was Francis Stephen 's attachment to his unmarried sister Princess Charlotte , Abbess of Remiremont , who was a frequent visitor . She shared her brother 's taste for shooting parties , in which she personally participated . In the year of Marie Antoinette 's birth , a party of twenty-three , three of them ladies , killed nearly 50,000 head of game and wild deer . Princess Charlotte fired over 9000 shots , nearly as many as the Emperor . This strong-minded woman was so devoted to her native Lorraine that she once said she was prepared to travel there barefoot . // Thus Marie Antoinette was brought up to think of herself as " de Lorraine " as well as " d'Autriche et de Hongrie . " In the meantime Lorraine had become a foreign principality attached to France , so that princes of Lorraine who made their lives in France had the status of " foreign princes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalties nor that due to French dukes . This ambiguous status was one from which the foreign princes ever sought to escape , while those of superior birth in French courtly terms sought to hold them down . A seemingly small point of French etiquette  --  small at least to outsiders  --  was to be of considerable significance in the future of Francis Stephen 's daughter . // This was an age of multiple intermarriage where royal houses were concerned . Insofar as one can simplify it purely in terms of her four grandparents , Marie Antoinette had the blood of the Bourbons  --  the Orleans branch  --  and of Lorraine on her father 's side . More remotely , her Orleans great-grandmother , a Palatine princess known as Liselotte , brought her the blood of Mary Queen of Scots via Elizabeth of Bohemia  --  but this was to go back 200 years . On the maternal side , Marie Antoinette inherited German blood from her grandmother Elizabeth Christina of Brunswick-Wolfbuttel , once described as " the most beautiful queen on earth . " Her appearance at the age of fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen her , everything that has been said about her is but a shadow devoured by the light of the sun . " However , if exceptional beauty was to be found in the pool of genes that Marie Antoinette might inherit , it was also true that the lovely Empress became immensely large and dropsical in later years . //
