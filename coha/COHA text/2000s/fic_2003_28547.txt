Chapter One MAYOR ANNIE MCCABE WAS LATE . Her meeting with Jack Corbin was not the kind of meeting a person was late for . It had taken three weeks of unreturned phone calls to get it . And in less than thirty minutes , she would be sitting across a table from the one man who had the power to prevent the town of Macon 's Point from drying up and blowing right off the Virginia state map . The population sign standing guard at the Langor County line read 3032 . Anyone passing through would likely label the town nothing special . True , there was no hubbub of cultural activity at its center , no opera or art museum . Only a farmer 's market and a once-monthly Friday night bluegrass jamboree . But Macon 's Point had become home to Annie in the past three years . And to her that meant something . In the year since her divorce , Annie had found peace in this town , a certainty that she would be perfectly content to spend the rest of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only problem ? If Jack Corbin auctioned off Corbin Manufacturing , half the town would have to move elsewhere . Somehow , tonight , she had to find the words to make him look for another solution to the company 's problems . Meanwhile , her hair was still wet , and her blouse was missing its middle button . " Mama ? " " What , honey ? " Annie wrestled a comb through her tangled hair , glancing up with a distracted smile at her six-year-old son 's reflection in the bathroom mirror . Sometimes it shocked her how much he looked like J.D. His hair was a shade of blond women tried to emulate in the priciest salons . His blue eyes had lashes thick enough to generate the same kind of envy . The one concession to cuteness over outright beauty was the dimple in each cheek . In the father , those dimples had once made her knees go weak . In the son , she was similarly unable to frown on even the most mischievous of deeds when he turned them on her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did he tell you that ? " Annie gave up on the comb and grabbed the hair dryer from the second drawer of her vanity . Tommy was always telling her something Cyrus had said . She sometimes thought the two of them had a language of their own . " No , but he ate it real fast . Was n't it s'posed to be my birthday cake ? " Tommy 's birthday was on Friday . Annie had made the cake early to freeze in an effort to be a step ahead of herself . She dropped the blow-dryer on the sink counter , grabbed her son 's hand and bolted down the stairs . " Cyyyyrus ! " With Tommy still attached to her hand , she skidded to a stop in the kitchen doorway , a run popping up in the right heel of her stockings . Too late . In the middle of the floor sat Cyrus , all one-hundred-plus pounds of him , his nose looking as if it had been dipped in chocolate , the plastic plate on which the cake had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dishwasher 's pot-scrubber cycle . " Oh , Cyrus . " " See , Mama . I told you he liked it . " " Bad , Cyrus . At least you look guilty , " Annie said , picking up the plate . Chocolate . The cake had been chocolate . Was n't chocolate bad for dogs ? She struggled to remember what she 'd heard about it , but only came up with the vague recollection that it could damage their nervous systems . Annie 's own nervous system was well on its way to meltdown . Cyrus hung his head and plopped down on the floor with a whine . Whether it was guilt or the beginnings of the stomachache that was his destiny , Annie did n't know . " Is Cyrus sick , Mommy ? " Worry lines knitted her son 's forehead . Six-yearold boys should n't have worry lines . But more often than not , Tommy did . " I do n't know , honey . He 'll probably have a bellyache . " " He 's not gon na die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepened . Alarm jangled along Annie 's spine . Cyrus was Tommy 's best friend . As much as she had been against getting the dog , she had to admit he had been good for her son at a time when he 'd desperately needed a diversion . But then if J.D. had n't run off with his all but jail-bait girlfriend , Tommy would have no need for a diversion . Giving a five-year-old boy a St. Bernard puppy was just the kind of thing J.D. was famous for . At least in the context of their marriage . Tommy had seen one in a dog-food commercial and asked his father if he could have a puppy like that . J.D. had gone right out and bought him one . Of course , doing so had made him a king in Tommy 's eyes . And when Annie had said he could n't keep it , she 'd been tossed the mantle of Cruella DeVil . Considering that Tommy had only recently begun to show signs of the carefree child he had once been , she did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demise . And on top of that , Annie now loved him , too . Even if he had been a present from J.D. " No , honey , " she reassured him . " But we 'll run him over to Doc Angle 's . They 'll know what to do . " The cordless phone on the kitchen counter rang , rattling Annie 's already rattled nerves . She glared at it , then yanked it up and barked a hello stern enough to deter even the most hardened of the telemarketers who always seemed to call around dinnertime . " Hey , babe . " Annie dropped her forehead onto a palm and rubbed the heel of her hand against a budding migraine . She really did have to get caller ID . " I do not have time to talk to you , J.D. " Tommy glanced up , his eyes widening in happiness just before a mask of indifference slipped up to conceal it . It had been months since he 'd asked to speak to his daddy on the rare occasions that J.D. called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lack of concern even in a boy his age . She and Tommy both had made excuses for J.D. until they 'd been forced to admit that was all they were . Excuses . ( Continues ... )
