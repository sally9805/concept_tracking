Listen closely around official Washington this week , and you can hear a very subtle sound . It 's people holding their breath . The latest Supreme Court term is drawing to a close . There are important rulings on affirmative action and gay rights still outstanding . But the decision that the city is really waiting for will be handed down by one man alone . At age 78 , with a bad back , a Republican in the White House and his own powerful legacy firmly in place , Chief Justice William Rehnquist may decide this would be the perfect time to retire . If he steps away now , he ensures that his successor will be chosen by a Republican President  --  and that it will happen before the hurly-burly of an election year . <P> But it 's been so long since we have had an old-fashioned confirmation bloodletting , you could almost forget the foul mood that overtook the U.S. during the fights over Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas . Washington was so shell-shocked by the Thomas battle that people were intent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a milder affair . And Stephen Breyer 's confirmation process proved to be a breeze . <P> If Rehnquist does step down , do n't expect a bipartisan buddy system to play much of a part in choosing his successor . George W. Bush has already parried a request made this month by the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Patrick Leahy of Vermont , for a fuller dialogue between the White House and Democrats on any high-court nominees . And if Sandra Day O'Connor should also retire this year , the struggle over her replacement could be judicial Armageddon , because O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy have been the court 's crucial swing votes . If Bush could replace her with a more consistent conservative , Roe v. Wade itself would be in jeopardy . <P> But whenever Rehnquist departs , he can do it in the knowledge that the court he led is likely to be remembered as one of the most influential in American history  --  and not just because of the 5-4 ruling in Gore v. Bush that effectively gave the 2000 election to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 31 years on the high court , 17 of them as chief . That has been time enough to see the court , and much of the nation , come around to the conservative views that once made him so isolated that he kept a Lone Ranger doll on his mantelpiece , symbolic of his many solitary dissents.
