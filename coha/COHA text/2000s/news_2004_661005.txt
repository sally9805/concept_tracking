<p> She did n't want to be a troublemaker ; she 's a US citizen , after all . So when American soldiers came to Jeanan Moayad 's house , looking for her father , she cooperated . She showed them his medical records and her own Texas birth certificate . Her father was in Jordan , she told them , undergoing surgery . So they took her husband instead . <p> As far as she knows , her husband is not accused of any crime . But Mrs. Moayad says US troops are holding him as a human bargaining chip , telling her repeatedly that they would detain her husband until her father surrendered . <p> " My husband did n't do anything , " says Moayad , a 35-year-old Iraqi architect who lived in Austin until she was five . Her chin trembling , she digs a tiny picture of him out of her purse , packed with documents related to his case and photos of their three children . Her husband , an architect named Dhafir Ibrahim , smiles calmly out of the scalloped frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes filling with tears . <p> " We repudiate that absolutely , " says Capt . Mark Doggett , a US military spokesman . " The coalition does not take hostages . I do n't have specifics on this particular case , but I can tell you on principle that we absolutely do not take hostages such as that lady has described . " <p> Amid a growing scandal over photographs of US soldiers abusing detained Iraqis , US occupation officials pledged last week that conditions had improved at Abu Ghraib , where Mr. Ibrahim is being held , and in other prisons in Iraq . " I will tell you that everything that goes on in Abu Ghraib today is in accordance with our procedures and policies , " said Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller , the new head of US-run prisons in Iraq , " and is in compliance with the covenants of the Geneva Convention . " <p> But conversations with families of detainees , as well as documents , suggest that coalition forces are still holding Iraqis who have not been charged with any crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Committee of the Red Cross quoted military intelligence officers who estimated that " between 70 percent and 90 percent " of the detainees in Iraq were arrested " by mistake . " <p> In some cases , occupation forces are even holding people whom they know to be innocent - sometimes for months after the US military itself has declared them cleared of any crime . Weeks after the scandal began to snowball , and 10 days after Miller 's claim , they are still holding them . <p> The Fourth Geneva Convention , which guarantees the rights of civilians under military occupation , forbids the use of " moral coercion " - such as holding relatives - to get information . It also prohibits punishing anyone for an offense he or she has not personally committed . <p> And both the Geneva Convention and international human rights law outlaw detaining people without speedy hearings and procedures for appeal . " There is a general prohibition against arbitrary incarceration , " says John Quigley , an international law professor at Ohio State University . " And if they 're holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a need to hold that person . " <p> A letter brings hope - but no action <p> Sometimes even fulfilling that obligation is n't enough . On Jan. 10 , American troops burst into the Abdul-Razaq family home near Baquba and handcuffed Wadhah Abdul-Razaq 's brother Harith and two cousins . According to a US military letter , an informant had accused them of being in a terror cell . On March 18 , a soldier drove back and delivered an apology - and the letter . <p> " All three of these men are innocent of the crimes they are accused of committing , " reads the letter , signed by an American officer and dated March 15 . ( The letter , of which the Monitor has a copy , also notes that the accuser was now awaiting trial in an Iraqi court for " false testimony . " ) <p> " You can not imagine how happy we were , " says Mr. Abdul-Razaq , a chicken farmer . " We believed they would truly fulfill their promises . We wanted to get in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we took this piece of paper , we would be able to release them . " <p> Two months later , he is still trying . In the past four months , Abdul-Razaq 's brother has been moved from Baquba to Tikrit , then to Abu Ghraib , and finally to Umm Qasr , in the south . " We never saw such terror in Iraq , " says Abdul-Razaq 's mother . " Not us , not our fathers , not our brothers . " <p> In the meantime , Abdul-Razaq got another letter , dated April 22 , restating his brother 's innocence and asking again for his release . It did n't help . While Abdul-Razaq hopes his brother will come home eventually , the family has been devastated by his detention : To this day , his 3-year-old son , he says , who saw his uncle arrested , is afraid to sleep alone . <p> Doggett said he could not comment on the case . " We 're getting buckets of requests about individual cases , so we 're not able to follow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot people due for release . " Inquiries Doggett passed on to the 1st Armored Division were not answered by press time . <p> Alastair Hodgett , a spokesperson for Amnesty International USA , in Washington , says Abdul-Razaq 's situation was not an isolated case . " Certainly the Geneva Convention , but also just basic standards for criminal procedure worldwide , would require that an individual that has been cleared of any crime would be released , " he says . " And certainly there 's no excuse for keeping somebody against whom there are no credible allegations . We 've also documented cases of individuals who were detained far beyond the point where the allegations against them had proved to be unfounded . " <p> A knock in the night <p> Moayad 's ordeal began Jan. 30 at 2:30 a.m. , when two Humvees pulled up to house . <p> The soldiers who came to her door asked for her father , Moayad Abdullah , a 66-year-old geologist and a Baath Party member . The family says they have no idea why he was of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what crime , if any , her father was suspected of committing - common practice , according to the Red Cross report . <p> " They told me it was because he was a Baathist , " she says . " They told me my father did n't do anything , but they just wanted to know information about another person . " <p> When the troops learned her father was out of the country , says Moayad , they arrested her husband . As Moayad 's mother began to cry , they promised to bring him back the next day , saying they just wanted to ask him a few questions . <p> For the next 18 days , Ibrahim was held at a Baghdad detention facility . On Feb. 17 , says Moayad , three soldiers came to her house and gave her a letter in her husband 's handwriting . After greeting her and the children with " peace and kisses , " the letter says he will be sent to Abu Ghraib " until the arrival of my father-in-law . " <p> " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reads the letter . " Please tell him that I am in his place and that I 'll be released when he arrives here , since I am not the wanted person , as you know from all who spoke to you about my case . Please inform my father-in-law to surrender himself of his own free will , and that will make things much easier for him . They do n't mistreat someone who surrenders of his own free will , but just the opposite - they only want to ask him questions . " <p> He apologizes for not being able to visit relatives during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha , which she celebrated alone two days after he was taken . " I send my warm kisses to our pretty little ones , and I hope that they are being loving , well-behaved , and doing well in school , " he writes . " Please tell them that I am traveling for some time , and do n't tell them anything else . " <p> Over the next three months , Moayad went to Abu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her well ; she remembers one in particular , a baby-faced young doughboy who started to cry when she told him her story . Like Dhafir , the soldier left an infant behind as he deployed and will return to find a toddler . <p> " He told me that he is the same as me - he has n't seen his children for eight or nine months , " she says , biting her lip . " He was very sweet and kind . " <p> Another soldier , moved by her story , looked up her husband 's name on the computer . But he told her he could n't do anything as her husband 's name was marked " intel value . " The Red Cross report describes a pattern of severe abuses against Iraqis deemed to have an " intelligence value , " ranging from physical abuse to " psychological coercion " like threats of execution . <p> Experts in international law say that arresting one person to put pressure on others amounts to " moral coercion . " " It 's clearly an abuse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to hold him until he gives information about somebody else , especially a close relative , " says Quigley . " Arrests are supposed to be based on suspicion that the person has committed some offense . " <p> Coalition authorities , while refusing to speak to the specifics of Ibrahim 's case , denied that they would ever detain one person as a means of pressuring another . But last November , coalition forces detained the wife and daughter of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri , one of Saddam Hussein 's top deputies . After Hussein 's capture last year , Mr. Douri became the most wanted Iraqi official . His wife and daughter remain in US custody , though they have not been charged . <p> Human rights monitors have accused the US military of committing a war crime by arresting Douri 's wife and daughter . " Taking hostages is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions - in other words , a war crime , " warned Human Rights Watch in a Jan. 12 letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . <p> Finally , a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 300 prisoners from Abu Ghraib , and pledged to release hundreds more in coming weeks . Moayad waited at home all day , hoping her husband would walk through the door . He did n't . But the next day , May 15 , she finally got to visit her husband in Abu Ghraib . <p> He told her to disregard the letter , and confirmed her suspicion that prison authorities forced him to write it . " He said they are treating him very well , very good , thanks be to God , " she says , her voice shaking with relief . <p> Moayad does n't blame America - " my first country " - for the months of living without her husband , or the job that he lost , or the time he missed with his children . She does n't even hold a grudge for the night when his family came over and shouted at her , blaming her and her father for his detention . <p> But she does want the American public to know what is happening , and what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think American citizens - as a country , not as soldiers - are very kind , very compassionate , " she says . " And I 'm sure they do n't like what is going on . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
