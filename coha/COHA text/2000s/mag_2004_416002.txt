The star of Hope &; Faith specializes in southern hospitality-even in a New York City high-rise // When it comes to decorating , " I 'm obsessed , " admits Ford . " I want it to be Christmas everywhere you look , with every little detail covered . " " You can tell how much thought a person put into a gift by the wrapping , " says Ford , who once worked as a gift wrapper . First , a few rules about the food . And for Faith Ford and her Louisiana relatives , Christmas is all about the food . " You eat your first meal at 11:30 , " says the star of ABC 's sitcom Hope &; Faith . " You absolutely eat before opening gifts and before the football games begin . " Second , you cook vast amounts of food . When she was growing up , that meant two types of turkey-roasted and smoked-ham , corn bread dressing , sweet potato casserole and an array of sides and desserts . " You always make enough for everybody to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone takes food home ! " Third , never mess with tradition-something even a proud southern hostess can forget on occasion . " One year I got this wild idea I wanted to do an English Christmas , with prime rib and Yorkshire pudding , " Ford says . " I wanted to take it to a higher level . " Her timing was off , the food took forever to bake , and her family did n't eat until well into the night . " I do n't know what I was thinking , " she says . " But I will never do that again . When you 're entertaining , the rule is stick with something tried and true . " Make that tried and loved . Ford 's culinary skills were legendary on the set of her decade-long TV hit Murphy Brown , where she played Candice Bergen 's bubbly sidekick Corky Sherwood . Ford would wow co-workers with still-steaming homemade biscuits , peach cobbler and jambalaya . Bergen , who recalls " sumptuous-looking , delicious-smelling , mouthwatering , my-mama-taught-me meals , " convinced Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooking with Faith : 125 Classic and Healthy Southern Recipes ( Scribner , $25 ) , written with Melissa Clark . Ford 's move to New York in 2003 to star opposite Kelly Ripa in Hope &; Faith has admittedly cramped her cooking style . Castmates have n't had the pleasure of Ford 's piping hot treats popping from the oven between takes ( although she has arrived with pastries baked the night before ) . And although her two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan 's Upper West Side is spacious by city standards , she misses her roomy kitchen in Los Angeles . Nevertheless , with husband Campion Murphy , 42 , a personal trainer turned screenwriter , and her beloved mutts Bosco and Tess , Ford has infused their home with small-town ( she hails from Pineville , La. ) charm and is intent upon downhome holiday values . " The holidays are about recharging and reevaluating life , " says the Emmy-nominated actress . " It does n't matter what your background is or your religious beliefs . " Raised a Southern Baptist who always went to church on Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a material level around the holidays . This is a time for turning over your past year and letting it go . About thinking about the New Year and setting goals for yourself . " Learning to let go has gotten easier since Ford married Murphy in 1998 . " Campion and I say there are no mistakes , " she says , " only lessons learned . " The couple met in Sedona , Ariz. , where Ford was vacationing after the end of her first marriage to aspiring actor Robert Nottingham . She attended a fitness/nutrition program where Murphy worked and the two clicked instantly , she says . " My husband is a real good thinker . We can go really deep in about two seconds flat . " As a result , the couple have adopted a holiday ritual of jointly compiling a list of things they want-and things they want to leave behind . " I 'll sit down and write a dream list for the New Year , " Ford explains . " We put it in a box and do n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good time to resolve things . " These days , the couple 's wish list may reflect their desire to have kids . " If it 's meant to be for us to have children , that 's one of our wishes , " Ford says . " My husband comes from a large Irish Catholic family . I know when we have kids we 're going to want to keep the traditions alive . " Meanwhile , Ford is wary of excessive Christmas commerce . As a high schooler , she worked as a gift wrapper at the local Wellan 's department store ( " I loved anything I could be creative at , " she remembers ) in order to afford gifts for her friends . But now , she says , " the gift-giving thing can get out of hand . It seems everyone I know has everything they need or want . If you 're getting a gift for somebody , really think about it . It does n't have to be a crazy expensive gift . It has to be well thought out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patricia , a retired elementary school teacher , her dad , Charles , an insurance executive , and her older sister Devon O'Day , a Nashville radio personality , whom she describes as her " mentor . " She also gathers with her husband 's large clan ( " If only half of them come , it 's 16 people , " she says ) . " I 'm a very family-oriented person , " Ford confirms . " The meal is about sharing and having time together . It forces everyone to sit down at the table and talk . That does n't happen very often . We give ourselves an excuse to do that at holidays .
