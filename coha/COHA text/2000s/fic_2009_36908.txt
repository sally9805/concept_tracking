Samantha entered the luxurious lobby of the Atlantian Hotel with a mixture of excitement and trepidation . Her pace slowed as she looked around , taking in every detail . The spacious lobby was amazing , ceilings that soared at least twenty-five feet supporting crystal chandeliers that sparkled and gleamed with light . The floor alternated glowing hardwoods with lush Persian carpets centering seating arrangements of plush sofas and deep easy chairs . Sidestepping from a direct line to the ballroom , she deliberately walked on one of the crimson carpets , her heels sinking in dangerously . Glancing around to make sure no one was watching , she savored the luxury , smiling in sheer delight . <p> She felt like a schoolgirl let out into the real world for the first time . Only this was not her world . Elegant hotels , fabulous balls , expensive gowns and jewels were only things she normally read about . This was a first  --  to actually be participating . She could n't believe she 'd actually let Charlene talk her into attending . <p> Samantha assumed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she appeared as if she attended events like this routinely . She checked in her coat , her practical wool a poor showing beside the cashmere and silk . <p> Clutching her small purse and purloined ticket , Samantha raised her chin and walked to the huge double doors opening into the ballroom . Atlanta 's Black and White New Year 's Eve Ball was one of the most prestigious charity events of the winter season . A recent tradition , its goal was raising funds for the Children 's League while celebrating the beginning of each new year . With such sponsors as Gideon Fairchild and Vanessa Winters , it attracted the crFme de la crFme of Atlanta society . And tonight Sam was mingling with them all ! <p> Samantha smiled at the white-gloved man at the door checking the coveted tickets . She showed hers wondering if he 'd immediately recognize she should not be here and block her entry . <p> He merely glanced at the embossed ticket and said , " Table twenty-one is near the dais . " <p> She nodded and entered the enchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every lavish decoration . White lights sparkled from a dozen chandeliers reflected in the antique mirrors that lined one wall . Even more gorgeous than the ones in the lobby , the crystal illumination offered a rainbow of colors matched only by the glittering jewels displayed by guests . <p> Round tables were set with fine linens , bone china and real silverware . Small , discreet signs with table numbers sat in each center . Waiters circulated with champagne , filling flutes expertly . Uniformed waitresses offered hors d'oeuvres . People were already sitting at some of the tables , even more were roaming around greeting friends . Sam took her time sauntering through the lavishly appointed room . She felt like Cinderella at the ball . She did n't know anyone here , but that would n't dim her excitement . <p> People smiled at her and she returned the silent greeting with an answering smile and slight nod . Her gaze moved to the dais where a table for those sponsoring the event was already filling up . There she recognized one or two famous residents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the event , everyone wore either white or black or a combination . The men looked superb in their dark tuxedos . Occasionally she 'd spot one wearing a white dinner jacket . Young and old alike looked more polished and debonair in a tux . She wished there were more events that required formal attire . Not that she 'd likely attend any of those , either . <p> The gowns the women wore were fantastic . The only colors were the jewels that sparkled at throats , ears and wrists . Her own string of pearls seemed subdued in comparison to the emeralds and rubies and diamonds that predominated . But they had belonged to her mother and she loved them . She could only pretend so much . <p> Normally when Samantha thought about white gowns , she envisioned wedding dresses . Not tonight . The creations ranged from sleek and sophisticated to almost indecent . More black gowns were present than white , but all were obviously designer creations . <p> Her own gown blended in perfectly . On loan from her friend Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strapless bodice gradually faded into gray then black at a wide band at the bottom of the floor-length skirt . It was more than fifty years old , but had been lovingly cared for and Sam felt as comfortable in it as she would have in one of today 's couture gowns . Because of its age , there was not a high likelihood of seeing another like it tonight . <p> She felt like a princess and held her head even higher to show off her gown . She had never worn anything so elegant before . Her hair , normally worn down or tied back in a ponytail , had been done by her sister into an upswept loop with a few curls cascading down her back . She repressed the urge to twirl around in giddy delight , feeling excited like nothing before . There would be dancing after the dinner . Would she get a chance ? An assessing look around her showed most people seemed paired . Sighing softly , she made up her mind to enjoy every moment  --  whether she danced or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend a Black and White Ball . <p> " Champagne ? " A waiter stepped close , a tray of filled flutes in his hand . <p> " Thank you , " she said , taking a glass . When he 'd passed on , she took a tentative sip . Mmm . Another sip . Champagne was not normally in her budget . This was delicious . <p> Before she could move , a man stepped in front of her . <p> " I 'm sure we have met , " he said with a grin . He sipped from his own flute of champagne and from the slight swaying on his feet she wondered how much he 'd already had . <p> " I 'm afraid not , " she said with a smile . <p> " Fred Pearson . At your shervice . " He shook his head . " Service . " <p> He reached out and caught her arm . " Here alone ? I am . Do n't like to come to these events alone . Too shhhtupid , ya know ? But I recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No . I 'm Samantha . " She did n't want to be rude but Fred was impeding her way to her table and she caught a couple of people looking at them . The last thing she wanted was anything to call attention to herself . What if someone questioned who she was and when she 'd bought the ticket ? <p> " I need to get to my table , " she said , hoping he 'd release her . <p> " Ah , my table is right over  --  " He looked around , peering at the numbers on the nearby tables , still holding on to her arm . <p> Sam began to wonder if it were to keep him upright . <p> "  --  somewhere , " Fred ended , obviously giving up on finding his own table . " Do you want to dance ? " <p> " The music has n't started yet , " Sam said , trying to pull away without making it too obvious . <p> Fred glanced around again , finishing the last of the champagne in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think dinner is first . It was nice to meet you . I need to get to my table . " <p> " My table is around here somewhere , " he said , stumbling a step as he turned to look around , almost pulling Sam off her feet . <p> " There you are . I was thinking I 'd missed you . " <p> Sam looked to her left where another man in a tux spoke to her . He looked at Fred . <p> " You need to let her go . I 'll take over now , " he said . <p> " Oh . Thought she was lost , " Fred said , swaying a little . He looked at his hand holding Sam 's arm and slowly released it . " Think I need another drink . " <p> " I think we do n't belong here , " her rescuer said . A warm hand grasped her upper arm and urged her quickly to the left . Guiding her through tables and making a way through the couples standing in conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned and looked properly at her rescuer  --  and promptly caught her breath . Her heart fluttered , her breathing stopped . He was gorgeous , tall and dark and breathtaking . He just oozed sex appeal . She 'd read about that before , but never experienced it . Now she knew what the books meant . Feeling slightly light-headed , she finally remembered to breathe . <p> He was so tall , her head barely cleared his shoulder . Wide shoulders that gave a new meaning to wearing a tux made the suit look as if it were designed with only him in mind and the ruffles on the shirtfront served to highlight his masculinity . His hair was cut just long enough to entice a woman 's fingers to thread through and dark eyes were framed by lashes a starlet would envy . His jaw was rugged . His sensuous lips curled into a slight smile , which showed a dimple indenting his left cheek . His gaze was firmly focused on her . Oh , dear , had he said something ? <p> She blinked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never paid attention to such things . Did coming to a ball like Cinderella give rise to Prince Charming expectations ? She almost laughed , except she felt giddy with her conflicting emotions . <p> " Are you all right ? " he asked . For the second time ? <p> " I certainly did n't expect a confrontation at this ball , " she murmured , glancing back to where Fred was making his way through the crowd . " Do you think he 'll be all right ? " <p> " Probably . But you never know with Boozer . " <p> " Boozer ? " she repeated . <p> " Fred 's nickname . Rumor has it he drinks bourbon for breakfast . He 's already three sheets to the wind and he 's only just arrived . Stay clear of him . " <p> " I shall . If I had seen him coming I would have gone the other way . Thank you for rescuing me . " <p> " My pleasure . " <p> A waitress stopped by them , offering tiny crackers covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried caviar before and had heard mixed reviews from friends who had . <p> Her companion had no compunctions . He took a couple , then looked at her . <p> " Not having any ? " <p> " I 'll try one , " she said , feeling daring . But with her small purse and the ticket in one hand and the other holding the champagne , she was n't sure how . <p> He solved that dilemma . " May I ? " he asked . He fed her one , his fingers barely brushing her lips . She did n't even taste the caviar , her whole being was riveted on the reaction to his barely felt touch . She shivered slightly , but not due to cold . She gazed up into deep brown eyes and felt her bones weaken even as every cell seemed to stir in anticipation of more . Oh , help , she was in trouble . <p> " Another ? " he asked , offering a second . <p> She nodded and he fed her again . This time she paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mmm , " she said , wrinkling her nose . She was not sure caviar would ever become a favorite . <p> He laughed and took another cracker for himself before the waitress moved on to the next guest . <p> " Not your thing , I take it , " he said as he popped the hors d'oeuvre into his mouth . <p> Sam shook her head , her gaze on his lips as he chewed the tidbit . Get a hold of yourself ! <p> " I 'm glad I got to sample it . Now I know I do n't have expensive tastes , " she said . <p> " Is this your first time here ? " <p> She nodded . <p> He glanced around . " Will your date know where to find you ? " he asked . <p> " I came alone . I think Fred  --  Boozer  --  picked up on that . " Did that make her sound odd ? Should she make up something about her date getting sick at the last moment or something ? <p> " So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll escort you , " he said genially . <p> She smiled , suddenly feeling like anything could happen tonight . Taking another sip of her champagne , she wondered why a man who looked like he did had come alone . Maybe his date really had got sick . <p> " Your wife was unable to attend ? " she asked , fishing for an answer without being too obvious  --  she hoped . <p> " I 'm not married . " His demeanor changed , instantly becoming somber . <p> Bad topic . She swept her arm toward the dais . " Mine is table twenty-one . The doorman said it was near the dais . " <p> He paused for a moment , staring at her . " How interesting . That 's my table also . " <p> She went on alert . For a moment tension rose . Surely he did n't think she had deliberately set out to sit at his table ? He had rescued her after all . Yet his reaction had definitely been odd . She still had the ticket out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly and gestured for her to walk toward the front of the large ballroom . <p> " My friends call me Mac , " he said , placing his hand at the small of her back as they wound through groups of guests chatting and laughing with enjoyment of the evening . <p> " Mine call me Sam . Short for Samantha , " she murmured , her heart pumping wildly  --  from his touch , or adrenaline , or just plain old fear of exposure , she was n't sure . No one had challenged her so far . She should feel safe . But she could n't help glancing around to see if anyone was paying special attention to her . Apparently not . <p> " Mac and Sam , sounds like a rock group or something , " he responded . Twice he spoke to people as they wound through the conversing groups , but he did n't stop to introduce Sam . <p> The tables were set for eight . A couple was already seated at table twenty-one when Mac and Sam reached it . Everyone introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair beside her . It was obvious the others thought they had come together . She waited for him to deny it , but he ignored the assumptions . <p> By the time the salad was served two others had joined them . Conversation became general and Sam relaxed as the meal progressed . It looked as if her gamble had paid off . She could give herself up to the sole purpose of enjoying the evening and no longer worry about discovery . How long had it been since she 'd gone out for fun and nothing more ? <p> Longer than she cared to remember , thanks to Hurricane George . <p> Mac was a perfect partner for dinner . He spent his time talking with her and the woman on his other side . Two places remained empty at the table . How odd that those people had not used their tickets . Or had they , too , been trashed ? The sponsors of this event had declared it to be a sellout . Was that just hype , or had something at the last moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final dinner plates had been removed and coffee served , the waitstaff quietly vanished and the night 's speaker was introduced . The speech was short and poignant , urging everyone present to take up the cause of the Children 's League and to be generous in support for disadvantaged children . <p> Then the wall to the right began to fold into panels and open revealing the dance floor and the orchestra providing the music . Along one wall a buffet table lavishly displayed desserts of all types . Two large open bars flanked the buffet tables . The rest of the room sparkled beneath the crystal chandeliers that illuminated the space , dimmed slightly to provide a sense of intimacy in the huge ballroom . <p> The music began and Mac turned to Sam . " Care to dance ? " <br> Continues ...
