The Magic Band <p> Joaquin turned the dial on his ham radio , letting his fingers rub against the worn edge . <p> He was trolling the six-meter band . The magic band . Not transmitting , just listening . Looking for some conversation , a good " rag chew " as the hams called it , that might distract him , and help him forget his worries about the coming week . <p> It was called " the magic band " because of its unique ability , under the right circumstances , to transmit and receive messages over very long distances with short antennas and low power . For this reason , the band attracted a wide range of aficionados . From high school students looking to get the most out of a cheap rig , to the kind of techies who casually tossed around phrases like " sporadic E propagation " and " F2 layer refraction . " <p> Tonight it did n't feel very magical . Pedestrian was more like it . The conversations were limp and surprisingly sparse . <p> But somewhere around 50.24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catalina coast , he caught a burst of static that intrigued him . <p> Years ago , Gabriel had taught him about the majesty of white noise : the monoliths of structure hidden in the chaos . <p> And this burst was chunky with structure . <p> He cocked his head toward the speaker , taking it in . It came alive in his mind . He imagined hanging over it , watching it roil beneath him like an angry sea . Then the roiling sea solidified , becoming jagged rocks and mountains . And then it was just sound again . But with a purpose , accreting toward a common goal . Sound seeking personification . <p> The room receded as he leaned closer to the speaker . <p> The sound seemed to tease him : its lattices of structure briefly weaving together , only to slide apart seconds later . And what the static became , in those short moments of cohesion , sent shivers down his spine . <p> It was a voice . <p> It was very clearly a voice . <p> He tried to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was n't mixed in with the static . It was a voice constructed from the static . He caught several phonemes , and the click of a consonant or two ; but he could n't stitch them together . He could n't make out words . <p> He leaned closer , concentrating . <p> Slowly , from the rise and fall in intonation , he realized he was hearing the same sentence repeated over and over again . But he still could n't make out even a single syllable . <p> He bent even closer , his ear inches from the speaker . <p> His brow furrowed and his muscles tensed as he searched for the meaning . It was almost there . He felt it roll gradually toward him , like a slow-moving ball . <p> Almost . . . <p> There was nothing else in the world , just him and these sounds . <p> Almost . . . <p> Nothing but this struggle . <p> Almost . . . <p> The first word was on the brink of unveiling itself when he felt a presence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped around ready to strike , only to see the familiar , laughing face of his girlfriend , Alondra . <p> " I love this : the host of the ' scariest show on Mexican radio ' is frightened by a tap on the shoulder . " <p> " Very funny , " Joaquin said , still somewhat shaken . <p> " You 're a bit like a cartoon character when you 're frightened . " <p> " You 're in ' tease mode ' tonight , I see . " <p> " A furry animal , I think . Cartoon rabbit maybe . " <p> " And it 's not over yet . " <p> " No , a cartoon mouse ! Big eyes , little whiskers twitching . " <p> Joaquin forced a chuckle , and as his senses returned , he shot Alondra a sly grin . <p> " Bet you were one of those girls who got a bit weak-kneed over cartoon animals . " <p> " Maybe , " Alondra said , her eyes going wide and looking very much like a cartoon herself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her close and looked deep into her big brown eyes . <p> " But you do n't seem like a furry animal anymore . " <p> " That 's the thing about us furry animals . In the daytime we 're all hijinks and songs , but at night we get serious . And I mean very serious . " <p> " Now , that 's a theory I 'd like to test , " Alondra said , pulling him toward the bedroom . <p> An hour and a half later , Joaquin lay on his side looking at Alondra 's lean naked body beside him . It glistened with a thin layer of postcoital sweat . She snuggled close to him , looking into his eyes . <p> " You worried about the trip ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " Your big play for ' crossover ' appeal ? " <p> " You know it 's not about that . " <p> " I know . Still in ' tease mode , ' I guess . " <p> Joaquin smiled and pulled her closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had n't realized it until Alondra asked the question . But Gabriel had been in his thoughts a lot recently . Maybe it was the trip back to Texas ; maybe it was just the time of year . Whatever the reason , Gabriel had felt especially close these last few days . <p> " Thought so . You had that look . " <p> Joaquin decided not to ask her what she meant by that . He was n't sure he wanted to know . <p> " Do you want to talk about it ? " <p> Joaquin shook his head . <p> Of course , he really did want to talk about it . He wanted to talk about Gabriel and the voice on the radio tonight , and the countless other things that had been coursing through his mind since he first learned he 'd be heading stateside . But he could n't do it right now , maybe not ever . <p> " You know I 'm always here for you . Anytime you want . " <p> " I 'd rather just try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Joaquin leaned over to shut off the light , still holding Alondra against his chest . As he lay back down , Alondra let out a contented sigh . Within minutes , her breathing deepened and he knew she was fast asleep . <p> Sleep did n't come as easily for Joaquin . His thoughts returned to the voice . He tried to convince himself it was some kind of illusion , brought on by anxiety about the week ahead . But he knew that was n't the case . He knew this was the first sign that his trip would provide him an answer to the mystery that had plagued him for almost eighteen years . <p> As he drifted off to sleep , thoughts of the voice and the trip receded , and he found himself remembering a recent caller to his radio show . <p> <br> Continues ...
