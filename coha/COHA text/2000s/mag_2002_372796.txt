When FBI agent Kenneth Williams wrote a memo last July warning that Osama bin Laden 's foot soldiers might be training in American flight schools , no one listened . Now his memo is the hottest thing in Washington . On Saturday Arlen Specter , a veteran Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , called FBI director Robert Mueller and urged him to turn over the memo . When Mueller refused , Specter snapped , " Congress gave you a 10-year term and expects a response from you , " according to a reliable account . " The people are entitled to an explanation . " Specter then called committee chairman Patrick Leahy at his farm in Vermont , and the two men agreed to summon Mueller  --  and the memo  --  to Capitol Hill this week and , if he refuses , hit him with a Senate subpoena . If the White House tries to fight the move , says a G.O.P. source , " as many as 20 Republican senators " would vote to enforce the subpoena . <P> The FBI does not want to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details a " live " investigation of at least two men believed to be tied to radical Islamic groups who are still at large in the U.S. The fight has raised the pressure on Mueller , who since taking his job just one week before Sept. 11 has been caught between Congress and his constituencies at the FBI and the Justice Department . <P> The one person who is n't talking about Williams ' memo is the man who wrote it . " I 'm really sorry , " Williams , 42 , told a TIME reporter who approached him outside his North Phoenix , Ariz. , home Saturday , " but I would get in trouble if I talked to you . " He is a mild and graying man , but a transcript of his testimony from a terror-related trial in February provides a glimpse of his fierce work habits . After Sept. 11 proved him right , he did n't blow the whistle on the disturbing breakdown in the chain of intelligence that followed his memo . He did n't quit . He did n't write a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore down harder than ever . <P> On Valentine 's Day 2002 , Williams took the stand against Faisal Al Salmi , a Saudi Arabian pilot accused of lying about his connections to Hani Hanjour , one of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 , which crashed into the Pentagon . Williams testified that he had been working 16- to 18-hour days as the case agent on the FBI 's post-Sept. 11 investigation in Arizona . He usually arrived at the office by 5 a.m. , and he did n't take a day off until Thanksgiving . The most senior member of a joint terrorism task force , Williams was in charge of " a couple of thousand leads , " some of which pointed to Al Salmi . Together with his partner George Piro , a fluent Arabic speaker , Williams conducted much of a 10-hour interrogation of the pilot . Al Salmi defiantly said there was nothing Williams or the government could do to him . " I told him that I believed that he was lying , " Williams said , " and that we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . " A jury concurred , and Al Salmi was sentenced to six months in prison .
