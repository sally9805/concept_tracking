1 <p> Two years later <p> " It 's official . " Henry Coleman slammed his Al 's Diner reservations book down on the counter . " Oakdale , Illinois , is the most fertile place on earth . " <p> " Only if you are not married , " Vienna Hyatt replied blithely . She flitted between the diner 's dozen tables , sliding colorfully laminated menus onto every place setting in preparation for their usual dinner rush . In her distinctive Swedish-mangled English , she added , " I have been studying this interesting verity for many months now . I believe I have discovered the secret to Oakdale 's baby boom . It only comes into effect if you are single . Very few married people here produce children . Have you also noticed this oddity ? " <p> " Hmmm ... " Henry opened the reservations book and ran his finger down the list of private kids ' parties Al 's Diner had hosted over the past few months . " Sage Snyder ... Parker Snyder ... Daniel Hughes ... Liberty Ciccone ... Nope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vienna had to reach across Henry , who was sitting at the counter , to file away her remaining menus . She did n't have to do it in such a way that first her breasts , then her hips , and , finally , the ends of her flowing ebony hair swished provocatively across his lap , but what fun would it have been otherwise ? <p> " Am I supposed to be listening to anything you say while you do that ? " Henry asked . Henry was an average-looking thirtysomething man of above-average height and below-average earning potential . He had ordinary brown hair , jug ears , chipmunk cheeks , and a smile that stretched from sideburn to sideburn . His girlfriend , on the other hand , boasted a face Plato would have described as " the golden proportion "  --  a nose no longer than the distance between the eyes , a small jaw , large eyes , and defined cheekbones . It was one that contained what modern-day scientists call " proportional physical symmetry . " Not to mention one that men responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strangled grunt , and finally blushing and running away in terror . As a result , Henry very rarely managed to actually listen to what Vienna was saying . <p> He tried his best , he really did . He loved Vienna so much that he even found her **26;154;TOOLONG accent charming . He genuinely wanted to hear what she had to say . But looking at her frequently proved too distracting . And , in this particular instance , her practically lying across his lap did n't help . <p> She turned around , resting the edge of her equally perfectly proportioned and symmetrical rear end against his thighs . That did n't help much either . <p> " And you know what other interesting fact I have also noticed ? " Vienna asked as she kissed Henry on the forehead . She kissed the bridge of his nose . She kissed his eyelid and his ear and the very tender square of flesh where jawbone meets neck . He definitely liked the direction this was heading in . <p> " Do tell . " <p> " You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You betcha . Single , footloose , fancy-free , fit as a fiddle and ready for ... " Henry was trying to figure out a way to suavely maneuver himself and Vienna onto the counter without violating the Health Department 's regulations against , well , having sex on counters , when Vienna 's words finally penetrated his lust-addled brain . <p> " Hey ! What 's the big idea ? " he exclaimed . <p> Vienna plopped awkwardly down on the counter . Henry did her one better in the slapstick department and actually slipped , hitting the floor with an ego-crushing thump . But he was up in seconds , eager to demonstrate that he had figured out what Vienna was up to . <p> " You 're talking about us two Oakdale-dwelling single people having a baby . I thought we 'd settled that . " <p> " You settled it by buying me a puppy . " <p> " Exactly . Pepper was for you to practice on . How did you like the helpless neediness , the constant ' accidents , ' the all-night whining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> " Exactly . " Henry had been shooting for droll . He 'd have settled for amusing . Vienna did not look amused . He changed tactics to remind her , " You are n't even sure if you really want a baby . You 're just reacting to the avalanche of babies all around us . It 's peer pressure , that 's what it is . A passing fancy . Like that entire first quarter of your life when you thought gorgeous locales , fabulous jewels , glittering parties , nonstop champagne , and strapping , wealthy men were the key to making you happy . Before you realized it was , in fact , a modest , heavily mortgaged diner in the charming American Midwest , complete with a debonair , though perhaps a touch less than strapping and a whole lot less than wealthy , chap . " <p> " So you are saying that our love is also what you call a passing fancy ? " <p> " No ! What passing ? No passing ! Interception ! " <p> Vienna stomped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your baseballing terms . " <p> " What ? Baseball ? No , it 's  --  never mind . Forget about my baseballing terms . You and I are the real thing . We 're long-term . " <p> " As in marriage ? " <p> " As in long-term investments . Special . Fixed . Secured . A careful accumulation of only the most valuable properties to be nurtured and pampered throughout the course of a lifetime to insure ultimate , maximum payoff . " <p> Henry figured he was safe focusing on money , Vienna 's second favorite topic , as a way to keep them off her first favorite topic  --  marriage . Over the past year , Vienna had taken to channeling her frustrations over their lack of wedded bliss by doggedly trying to push all their friends into the bonds of matrimony . Which was fine with Henry . He liked to think of said friends as helpfully taking the bullet actually meant for him . <p> " If you do not take better care of those investments , " Vienna said with a pout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious , special , secured assets . " <p> Henry wondered if that was a deliberate joke or an English-mangling malapropism . It was so hard to tell with Vienna , but either way , Henry had a feeling he was getting his assets handed to him in a sling . <p> " Admit it , " he challenged . " You 're not so sure about this parenthood thing yourself . You love our life the way it is . A baby would change everything . " <p> Vienna hesitated . <p> Henry smiled . According to his favorite writer , nineteenth-century Irish wit Oscar Wilde , " She who hesitates is won . " Would the man who also said that " one 's real life is often the life which one does not lead " steer Henry down the wrong path ? <p> " So it 's settled , " Henry barreled on , afraid to discover that what he discerned to be Vienna 's hesitation was merely her pausing to refill her lungs so that she might unleash a torrent of fresh persuasion in his direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , " he said firmly . <p> The bell over the diner 's front door jingled merrily . Probably just as well that they 'd been forced to put their amorous activities on hold , Henry thought . One never knew when the Health Department might unexpectedly drop by . <p> Lucinda Walsh entered the diner in all of her dowager , stiff-haired , well-heeled glory . She wore a floor-length fox fur and made a point of carefully lifting the hem so that it just brushed the middle of her knee-high , black suede boots , and not the diner 's recently swept , but obviously not very well , plebeian floor . At sixty-plus years old , Lucinda carried herself with the expected self-confidence of a woman who 'd made her money the old-fashioned way  --  she 'd married it . Then she 'd waited for her elderly husband to die so she could drive his multimillion-dollar company to even greater , billion-dollar heights . <p> Lucinda looked critically from Henry to Vienna and back again . She said , " I need to speak with you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oozing pustule on the flesh of society , " Lucinda announced . <p> " Guess we wo n't be naming a sandwich after him then , " Henry muttered . <p> Thanks to Lucinda 's colorful description , Henry felt a bit queasy as he handed her a menu . She , however , slid grandly into the nearest booth , accepted the menu , and skimmed it briefly before archly raising an eyebrow . " No wine list ? " <p> " Our sommelier is in the Republic of Armenia this week for the annual master conference . Naturally , " Vienna replied without missing a beat . <p> Lucinda raised her eyes to peer challengingly at Vienna . The younger woman met her gaze calmly and held it for a long beat . With the hint of a smile , Lucinda returned her menu to Vienna . " Naturally , " she agreed . <p> " You were saying something about Craig Montgomery oozing and rotting , " Henry prompted , less interested in what Lucinda ultimately had to say than he was in moving the conversation along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of words would n't precisely complement their special of the day . <p> " And those are his good qualities , " Lucinda snarled . <p> " Agreed . But Craig has n't bothered anyone in Oakdale since he went on the run for bombing Paul Ryan 's car . " <p> " Disagreed ! " Lucinda bellowed . She did have a most remarkable bellow . Not unlike a mountain lion protecting her cubs . While performing a speech by Lady Macbeth . For the hard of hearing . <p> " She disagrees , " Henry translated helpfully for Vienna 's benefit . English was n't her first language , after all . Vienna nodded , either mesmerized or petrified . <p> " Craig is still tormenting a great many people in Oakdale , due to his relentless hunt for my poor granddaughter Lucy , " Lucinda said . " His machinations with Johnny and the attempt to turn Paul into charcoal briquettes was only the most recent in his long , long , long list of criminal acts . Honestly , I do n't know what my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I ever did , for that matter . " <p> Vienna blanched . " You and your daughter 's husband  --  " <p> " Do n't be vulgar , dear . It was before he was my daughter 's husband . " <p> Seeing that Lucinda did n't want to linger on the subject of her long-ago romance with Craig and that she was also less than pleased with Vienna 's implied question , Henry hurried to redirect the conversation away from Lucinda 's checkered past and back to Craig 's . " Craig and Paul were also once in love with the same woman , " he explained . " Meg Snyder loved Paul but she married Craig , then got pregnant by Paul and lost the baby . Then she dumped them both . " <p> " Are you quite finished ? " Lucinda wanted to know . <p> " Yes , " Vienna answered for him . <p> " Thank goodness . " Lucinda cleared her throat . " Lucy ran off with Johnny to protect him from Craig 's brand of parenting . If anyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . She was named after me , you know . Lucy gave up her life for Johnny  --  even after I begged her not to  --  in order to save him from growing up as a perpetual pawn between Craig and Paul . It was no minor sacrifice . She had a promising medical career , a fellow who cared for her , a grandmother who would have given her no less than the moon if she had asked . For goodness ' sake : Tell me what the point is of having children , of reproducing your bloodlines , if those same ungrateful offspring refuse to take advantage of your life experience to make their own road in life a little easier ? Tell me ! " <p> Henry and Vienna exchanged stymied looks and shrugged . <p> " Lucy was supposed to keep in contact with me ! " Lucinda raged . " I insisted she do so ! I could have helped her , I could have smoothed her way . Instead , she cut herself off from all of us , including Sierra , her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child to let her know that Craig is on her trail ! " <p> " You have n't heard from Lucy ? " Vienna asked . <p> " Not in months . It 's as if a large hole opened up in the earth and swallowed my granddaughter whole , then stuck its tongue out to taunt me for good measure . " Lucinda peered directly into Henry 's eyes and proclaimed , " I want you to find Lucy for me . " <p> " Me ? " Henry yelped , sounding like a monkey protesting the theft of his last banana . While drinking a martini . " Why me ? " <p> " Because the FBI informed me that my granddaughter 's disappearance is an international matter , the CIA told me it was a family matter , and the Jokedale Police Department ca n't even get a lock on Craig Montgomery 's whereabouts , despite his being at the top of their most wanted list . I guess that 's what happens when the fugitive 's sister is the chief of police . Margo keeps claiming she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to closing the deal , he mysteriously escapes her clutches . I am tired of government-funded incompetence . I 've decided to take matters into my own hands . To that end , I seem to recall that before you dedicated your life to playing Chef Boyardee alongside your Swiss Miss  --  " <p> " I am Swedish . " <p> " And your people make a spectacular meatball , darling , do n't interrupt  --  Henry , were you not the proprietor of a detective agency ? " <p> " Well , yes , the Early Bird Detective Agency . But that was years ago . " <p> " Splendid . Then it should n't be too difficult for you to transition from Early Bird Culinary Specials back to your previous line of work . You are familiar with all the players in this sordid family drama . Courtesy of your fiasco of a marriage to his sister , Katie , you and Craig were even relations for a short time , were you not ? " Lucinda reached into her purse . " Will you take the job ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ? Only to me and no one else , is that clear ? Paul Ryan would love to unearth where Lucy is hiding . His obsession with regaining Johnny is still running neck and neck with Craig 's . Well , tough . He can hire his own minions . " <p> " I 'm sorry , Lucinda . " Henry feigned a contrite expression . " We 're very , very busy these days . The pepperkakor season is almost upon us again and  --  " <p> " Who or what , pray tell , is a pepperkakor ? " Lucinda demanded . <p> " A pepperkakor is a ginger cookie , " Vienna explained , thrilled to finally be contributing to the discussion . " We serve them here at Al 's . They are a huge favorite in Sweden , especially during the Christmas holiday season . " <p> " It 's also my little pet name for Vienna , " Henry waxed poetic . " Because she 's sweet and spicy and , well , Swedish . " <p> " Enough . " Lucinda held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost interest . " She took out a medium-sized manila envelope and tossed it on the table between them . " I 'll pay you fifty thousand , plus all expenses . Here is ten thousand in cash up front to get you started . You will receive the remainder when you locate Lucy and Johnny . " <p> " We will do it , " Vienna said . <p> Lucinda beamed . " I knew you were good for more than just cuckoo clocks . " <p> " That is the Swiss . I am Swedish , " Vienna called after her . But Lucinda was already up and walking out the door . <p> " What are you thinking ? " Henry asked Vienna the minute La Walsh was out of earshot . <p> " Well , at this very moment , I am thinking about how I will redecorate the diner for fifty thousand dollars . Plus maybe a padded expense or two , " Vienna explained gleefully . <p> " This is ridiculous . We do n't know anything about locating missing persons . Especially a missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . " <p> " But you ran a detective agency ! " <p> " Ran it straight into the ground . " <p> " This is not a problem . We will learn on the job , just like we learned how to run a diner . " <p> " Speaking of which , who do you think is going to run our baby  --  sorry , bad choice of words ... who do you think is going to run our fully mature bundle of ... no , that 's not it , either ... Who 's going to watch the diner while we go gallivanting around the globe looking for Lucinda 's errant young ? " <p> " It is not a problem . We will close up shop for a few days . Finding Lucy and Johnny should not take more than a week or two of our time . It might even be good for business . " <p> " How do you figure that ? " <p> " Absence makes the heart grow fonder , does it not ? " <p> " That 's for romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of our puppy , Pepper ? You know , Vienna , when you assume responsibility for a small , defenseless , drooling life-form , you ca n't simply pick up on a whim and jet off to glamorous spots unknown . Something to think about , huh ? " <p> " Emma Snyder has offered to let Pepper stay at her farm anytime we like . She says the grandchildren adore playing with him , and Pepper loves running about in the fresh air . " Vienna placed her index finger on Henry 's nose and traced a line down to the spot between his collarbones . He tried to kiss her finger when it flicked across his lips , but Vienna was too quick . " Or would you rather that we forget about traveling and instead stay where we are so we can continue our earlier conversation ? " <p> Henry put on his enthusiastic face and brightly asked , " So if you were Lucy Montgomery , where do you think you 'd go ? " <p> Vienna smiled . Henry could tell she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask what . <p> Copyright 2009 by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions , Inc . <br> Continues ...
