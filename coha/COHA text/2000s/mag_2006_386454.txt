Medical tests that every woman should take to ensure better health // FOR many reasons , controllable and otherwise , on nearly every health index , Black women have higher instances of undetected , chronic illnesses and shorter life expectancies than their counterparts . Contributing to the poor status of health among Black women are unhealthy lifestyle choices and behaviors , the inability to obtain affordable health insurance , and the fact that Black women tend to overlook proper health care because they are too busy taking care of everyone else . Lack of knowledge about certain health issues has also helped to create a health disparity among Black women , says Adrienne Smith , public health advisor in the office on women 's health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . " A lot of women are n't aware of the importance of preventive screenings , and knowledge is power , " says Smith . Fortunately , women no longer have to be victims . Women have the power to stay healthy by acknowledging the diseases that afflict them and learning how to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , the importance of preventive care needs to be emphasized , and that understanding applies no matter what age . There are health exams that every woman needs , and these exams can be beneficial in identifying serious problems , according to the National Women 's Health Information Center . Simple , yearly screening tests , such as Pap smears and mammograms , can detect diseases early and that can increase chances of survival . Bottom line : Be concerned and educate yourself on the effective steps needed to live a long and healthy life . GENERAL HEALTH Regular , yearly physical exams are very important , and that importance will increase , as we grow older . Combined with an overall healthy lifestyle , an annual visit to a physician is the best way that women can preserve their health , says Yvonne Collins , M.D. , assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago . " Lifestyle plays a very important role in our health , " says Collins . " Not practicing healthy behaviors such as eating a well-balanced diet , exercising regularly and getting regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , physical exam should include weight , height and blood pressure checks , as well as eye and ear checks . Blood tests , urinalysis and the updating of immunization records also should be done . Proper immunization , at regular intervals , has saved many lives . Twice yearly dental visits for cleanings and checkups also should be on every woman 's schedule . Also , an annual visit to the eye doctor will allow the doctor to check your eye for movement , vision , sharpness and pressure . These exams can also determine whether or not you need corrective lenses and to identify new vision problems . BREAST HEALTH Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women ( other than skin cancer ) , and although White women are diagnosed more often , Black women are much more likely to die from it , according to the American Cancer Society . Proper screening is imperative , because with many cancers symptoms usually do n't appear until the disease is in advanced stages-and that is too late . Clinical breast exams should be a part of a yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 , according to the American Cancer Society , which also suggest women perform breast self-examinations , starting in their 20s . Women should report any breast change promptly to their health care providers . " A vast majority of cancerous lumps are picked up by the patients themselves , if they are performing the self-exams religiously , " says Dr. Collins . If you 're 40 or older , you should have a yearly mammogram . A mammogram is an x-ray of your breast tissue to detect breast lumps or suspicious changes that may be too small to be detected during a physical examination . If you 're at high risk for breast cancer , with a strong family history , it 's recommended that you discuss your family history with your doctor and start having mammograms earlier . The earlier breast cancer is detected , the greater a woman 's chance for survival . Remember , every woman is at risk for breast cancer , and the risk increases with age . But no woman has to die of breast cancer-a diagnosis does not have to be a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should begin after a woman reaches 18 , or when she becomes sexually active , whichever occurs first . A Pap smear is a test that examines cells collected from the cervix to screen for cervical cancer and other abnormalities at an early and treatable stage . Annual Pap smears are especially important during a woman 's reproductive years . Healthy reproductive organs can help prevent problems during pregnancy and childbirth . An additional next step is to be screened for common sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) , which can cause infertility , and birth defects . The Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) is considered to be a major cause of cervical cancer , which is related to a woman 's sexual behavior , says Dr. Collins . So practicing proper sexual safety precautions , such as using condoms or practicing abstinence , are highly recommended . According to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , about 10,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year , and women who do not have regular gynecological care are up to seven times more likely to be diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is colon cancer . The American Cancer Society recommends that when women reach the age of 50 , they should undergo either a fecal blood occult exam annually , or a periodic flexible sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy . There are numerous other areas where screening tests can improve the health status of Black women . In addition , experts recommend that women get proper cholesterol , diabetes and bone mineral density tests as well . Getting regular skin exams that will look for irregularly shaped moles that are growing and changing rapidly can help detect skin cancer , which is the highest form of malignancy among women . Also be aware of signs of depression and steer clear of abusive relationships , because mental health is important , too . WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO TO STAY HEALTHY ? There are controllable life factors in terms of preventive health care for Black women , says Smith , and she believes it begins with an overall attitude of good health . This includes avoiding risky behaviors , sexually and otherwise , getting adequate rest , reducing stress , eating healthy and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you want to live a healthier life , you can begin to look into the resources and services that are needed , " says Smith . Women of lower socioeconomic status are encouraged to look into local and state health departments , or a local Planned Parenthood Center for low-cost gynecological and health exams . Unfortunately , all too often Black women wait too long to get proper medical attention . Good health is all about power-power of prevention and understanding that your health is in your hands . Challenge yourself to make the right decisions , and urge other Black women to do the same . - Stephanie N.
