UNDER THE SIGN // OF LYCURGUS // The image of Sparta as a dour , barracks-like camp hardly prepares the first-time visitor for the glorious spectacle that unfolds as one emerges from the uplands abutting Arcadia to the north and enters down the Eurotas valley into the Spartan plain . Stretching before one are two parallel mountain chains , that of Taygetus on the west reaching to 2,404 metres at the peak , and that of Parnon on the east ( 1,935 metres at its peak ) . The alluvial plain itself , and its continuation south in the Eurotas valley that runs out into the sea in the Laconian Gulf , constitute one of the most fertile and desirable pieces of land in all southern Greece . Soil , climate and man conspire to yield and garner sometimes two harvests of grain in a single year . Olives and grapevines , the other two staples of the so-called Mediterranean diet , flourish here too - as of course does the forest of citrus trees , but they are a post-Classical import , reminding us that the terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the inhabitants of two and a half millennia ago . // Hardly surprisingly , this region , known in historical times as Lacedaemon , was believed also to have been the seat of a great king in the ancient Greeks ' heroic age - what we scholars more prosaically call the Mycenaean or Late Bronze Age ( c. 1500-1100 BC ) . An attempt has been made very recently ( see biography of Helen p. 48 ) to relocate the palace of Homer 's Menelaus from Sparta to Pellana further north in Laconia , but that flies in the face not only of ancient legend and religious worship but also of topographical geopolitics . Any real Late Bronze Age Menelaus must have had his palace in or near the site of historical Sparta - perhaps actually where a large settlement , including a building qualifying as a mansion ' , has been scrupulously excavated by the British School at Athens . However , no contemporary palace on the scale of those excavated at Mycenae ( seat of Homer 's Agamemnon , brother of Menelaus ) and Pylos ( capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laconia - and perhaps never will . It is important not to read Homer as a straight history textbook , however archaeologically productive that mistake has undoubtedly been . // HELEN // Helen of Troy - or Helen of Sparta ? She was , of course , both . A local girl , daughter of Tyndareus , according to one version of her myth , but yet , according to another version , daughter of great father Zeus and born miraculously from an egg because her mother Leda had been visited by Zeus in the disguise of a swan . Her unsurpassed beauty made her a natural prize for the ambitious Menelaus , son of Atreus of Mycenae , whose older son Agamemnon took Helen 's sister Clytemnestra for his bride . However , that beauty also captivated an unwelcome visitor to Sparta : Paris , prince of Troy in Asia , overlooking the straits of the Dardanelles , who - aided crucially by the Cyprus-born love goddess Aphrodite - violated the sacred obligations of guest-friendship and robbed Menelaus of his lawfully wedded wife . // Recently , a Greek archaeologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen 's ( and Menelaus ' ) palace , not at Sparta but at Pellana some fifteen kilometres farther north . That claim would have astonished the ancient Spartans , who built a new shrine for Helen in Sparta , or more precisely at Therapne to the south-east of the ancient town , where she received worship along with her husband Menelaus and her divine brothers the Dioscuri , Castor and Polydeuces ( Pollux in Latin ) . This was in the later eighth century , a time when the Spartans were , so to speak , rediscovering their roots , seeking to legitimize their recently won domain in south-east Peloponnese by presenting it as the legitimate successor of the kingdom of Menelaus as set out in Homer 's Iliad . In actual fact , the cult of Helen at Therapne probably reflects a conflation of two Helens : one a goddess of vegetation and fertility associated with trees ( also worshipped as such on Rhodes ) , the other the heroic Helen of Homeric legend . We shall stick with the latter . // More specifically , since Helen served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must ask , was Helen raped ( according to our usage of that term ) by Paris or did she go with him consensually , of her own accord ? Herodotus , father of history ( in the phrase of Cicero ) , has three very interesting passages regarding Helen . The first comes in his opening aetiology of the Graeco-Persian Wars of the early fifth century , where he traces the history or mythography of Greek-Oriental enmity back through the mists of time and legend . A series of claims and counter-claims is wittily rehearsed , with Herodotus purporting merely to relate the stories he has been told by learned Phoenicians and Persians . Among them features , inevitably , the theft , if that is what it was , by Paris of Helen . Herodotus himself adopts a robust , not to say male chauvinist , view of the matter : // it is obvious that no young woman allows herself to be abducted if she does not wish to be . // However , an unambiguous tale , not related by Herodotus , of an earlier rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but a girl rather than an adult wife , tells a different story . Lately , both Elizabeth Cook in her imaginative retelling of Achilles ' story and John Barton in his no less powerful Tantalus play-cycle have reminded us opportunely of this earlier , darker chapter in Helen 's eventful life . // The next reference to Helen in Herodotus is , if anything , even more disturbing , from the historical point of view . For according to him , as he relates it in his account of matters Egyptian in the //
