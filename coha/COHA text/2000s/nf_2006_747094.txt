This study examines the relationships of college student employment and its ' effect on student life . Approximately 500 , 19-24 year old , mid-western university undergraduates participated in an " on-line " survey . Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analyses , reliability and correlations . Study time/student time positively correlated with employment while grade point negatively correlated with employment . Attendance and family relationships were not related to employment . " Beyond class " ( social interactions ) and persistence toward a degree positively correlated with employment while extra-curricular activities and socializing negatively correlated with employment . Employment was not related to study time ; however , it was found that students spend less time preparing for class than recommended . Consistent with other research , students who are employed more had lower GPA 's . A correlation between attendance and employment was not found , possibly due to students effectively coordinating work and class schedules . Although greater employment would likely predict less time spent with family , this finding was not validated by the data . Increased time on campus correlated with student success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faculty . A positive correlation between employment and persistence toward a degree was found . <p> Tuition and fees began to grow much more rapidly than consumer prices in the 1980 's . The cost of attending college rose over three times as fast as median family income . This trend of rapidly-increasing college costs continues . Average tuition and fees at both public and private four-year colleges and universities rose 38% in the past decade ( Boehner &; McKeon , 2003 ) . According to information gathered from the College Board and the Census Bureau , since 1981 the cost of a public four-year college education has increased by 202% , while the Consumer Price Index has gone up only 80% ( Boehner &; McKeon , 2003 ) . <p> The increase in college costs is also reflected in the percentage of increased student loan debt . Student loan debt is 85% higher among recent college graduates who took on debt while attending public four-year colleges than among graduates from a decade ago . Recent graduates owed an average of $15,100 in 1999-2000 , up from $8,200 in 1989-1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their undergraduate degree . Since the 1970 's , loans have increased from about one-fifth to more than half of all student aid ( DeBard , 2002 ) . <p> It is not surprising that both the number of students who are employed and the number of hours they are employed has increased over the years . One in five full-time employed students worked 35 or more hours per week ( King &; Bannon , 2002 ) . Furr and Elling ( 2000 ) found 41.1% of entering freshmen expected to get a job to help pay college expenses , up from 34.7% in 1989 . In addition , they also found 6.4% of freshmen expected to be employed full-time , up from 3.2% in 1982 . Among students who were employed to pay school expenses and who attended school full-time , 19% were also employed full time , and 27% were employed part-time ( National Center for Education Statistics , 2002 ) . <p> The average number of hours employed by on-campus students was 9.6 hours compared to 24.4 hours by off-campus students ( Furr and Elling , 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents , while 91% of the students employed full time resided off-campus . <p> Employment while in college is not necessarily a hindrance to students . Working a limited number of hours ( e.g. ten hours a week ) at an on-campus job appears to have positive impacts on student performance . However , working an excessive number of hours ( e.g. 35 hours or more per week ) does have adverse consequences for students , such as class schedule limitations , fewer number of classes they can take , and limited library access . Students who work full-time are also more likely to drop out of school ( J. Orszag , P. Orszag , &; Whitmore , 2001 ) . <p> Purpose of study . The purposes of this study are to describe the effects of employment of university under-graduate students on 1 ) student role , 2 ) family relationships , 3 ) social interactions , and 4 ) persistence ( the continuation of enrollment until graduation ) . Recommendations for college bound youth are developed . <p> Theoretical framework . The theoretical framework for this study is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Firebaugh ( 1988 ) , ( See Figure 1 ) . <p> The input for this model include the demographic factors regarding the university student including : age , U.S. citizen , gender , number of credits completed , college of enrollment , job title , wages , reasons for working , source of economic support , marital status , number of children , full or part-time student , parent 's education , place of residence and place of employment . Throughput is the independent variable and refers to the extent of student employment . Output is represented by the information resulting from the study related to the various items as reflected in student role , family relationships , social interactions , and persistence toward a degree . The findings , information to be used by present and future students , advisers , counselors , and parents , represent the feed-back of the system ( See Figure 1 ) . Review of Literature <p> Extent of Employment and Student Role <p> In general , students working part-time , or fewer than 20 hours per week , reported little or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine hours per week , no students believed their schedule frequently nor negatively impacted their academic progress ; 29% of the students employed between 30-39 hours per week and 39% worked full-time indicated that work did have a negative impact on academic progress ( Furr and Elling , 2000 ) . Astin ( et al. , 1994 ) also reported that fulltime employment during college had a significant negative impact on student 's grades . On the other hand , King ( 1999 ) reported that students who are not employed have lower GPA 's than whose who are employed under 15 hours per week . As the number of hours employed above 15 hours increases , GPA decreases ( 1995-1996 U.S. Department of Education 's National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) ) . <p> Schuman ( 1985 ) found that class attendance , in conjunction with SAT scores , had a positive relationship between grade point averages . Attendance significantly correlated with academic achievement on examinations and outside assignments ( Launius , 1997 ) . Twelve percent of last year 's freshmen at four-year residential colleges reported spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority , 63 % , said they spent 15 or fewer hours on class preparation . Nineteen percent of freshmen reported spending only one to five hours per week preparing for classes . Education experts suggest that is well below the minimum needed to succeed . Seniors reported studying even less than freshmen , with 20 percent studying 1 to 5 hours per week ( Young , 2002 ) . <p> Extent of Employment and Family Relationships , Social Interactions and Persistence Toward a Degree <p> No recent studies were found on the extent of employment for the undergraduate university student and family relationships . Activities that limit student contact with peers or that physically removes the student from campus negatively impact a student 's cognitive and affective development ( Astin 1996 ) . <p> Students with greater employment were more likely to drop out of school ( Ehrenberg and Sherman , 1986 , Orszag , Orszag , &; Whitmore , 2001 , and Ewers , 2002 ) . Students who attend school full-time are far more likely to persist ( 73% ) than those who attend school part-time ( 25% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported here are based on responses to a web-based survey by 500 undergraduate students in a mid-western university . Extent of employment was the independent variable . Student role , family relations , social interaction , and persistence toward a degree were dependent variables . Student role was defined as the student 's grade point average , student 's study time in hours per week , and student 's class attendance . Family relations was defined as the student 's behavioral , psychological , and social relations among various members of the nuclear family and the extended family . Social interaction was defined as the student 's interaction with members of a peer group , and persistence as the continuation of enrollment until graduation . <p> Data were analyzed using exploratory factor analyses , reliability , and correlations . Findings <p> Approximately 60% of respondents were female and 40% male . The majority of students ( 72.7% ) were 20 to 22 years old . Most ( 93% ) had no children . Ninety-nine percent had never married . Fifty-three percent were employed for financial reasons and 38.6% were employed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours worked per week was 23.11 . About thirty percent completed 15 credit hours during the previous semester , with 12 hours being second in frequency and 19.4% . Thirty-seven percent reported that the highest educational level completed by the student 's mother was a college degree ; 25.9% reported some college ; 19.3% reported a high school diploma . Findings were similar for the student 's father where 36.5% reported their father 's highest educational level completed was a college degree ; 21.6% reported some college ; 19.8% reported a high school diploma . Sixty-nine percent reported living off-campus while 19.6% reported living on-campus . Fifty-five percent worked an average of 15.6 hours on-campus and 70% worked an average of 20.3 hours off-campus . <p> Relationship between Student Employment and Student Role <p> Three items represented student role : 1 ) difficulty in finding time to do all things required of me as a student , 2 ) it was difficult to do everything I was expected of a student , and 3 ) employment interfered with time spent studying outside the classroom . There was a significant positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ( 497 ) = .279 , p &lt; 0.01 ( See Table 1 ) . The higher the number of hours employed the more employment interfered with study time and student time . <p> Two items , cumulative and previous semester grade point constituted the grade point average . A negative correlation existed between GPA and extent of employment as shown in Table 1 , r ( 489 ) = - .229 , p &lt; 0.01 . The higher the number of hours employed , the lower the GPA . <p> Class attendance was important to me and my university instructors expected me to attend classes were the two items factored into class attendance . Correlations between attendance and extent of employment were not significant , r ( 505 ) = - .077 , p =.082 . <p> Relationship between Student Employment and Family Relationships <p> One factor represented family relationships . Items included : 1 ) enjoyed spending time with my family , 2 ) having close contact with family was a priority , 3 ) how often student communicated with members of family . Correlations between family relationships and extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = - .022 , p = .617 . <p> Relationship between the Extent of Student Employment and Social Interactions <p> Three factors represented social interactions . Factor one grouped five items in reference to employment interfering with : 1 ) meeting classmates outside of class to prepare class assignments , 2 ) chances to get acquainted with other students , 3 ) social life , 4 ) the opportunity to work on projects with other students , and 5 ) the opportunity to attend school ball games , dances , or parties . A positive correlation between beyond class and extent of employment as shown in Table 1 , r ( 500 ) = .380 , p &lt; 0.001 was found . The higher the number of hours employed , the more opportunities there were for students to have beyond class social interactions . <p> Seven items grouped for the activities variable : 1 ) number of school teams or clubs student participated in , 2 ) hours spent in extra curricular activities , 3 ) participating in extra-curricular activities was a priority , 4 ) frequency of attending a campus club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , etc. , 6 ) worked on an off-campus committee or student organization , 7 ) provided leadership for a club or organization . These factors are referred to as extra-curricular activities . For the five Likert scale items , Cronbach 's alpha revealed a reliability of .845 . All factors were converted to z scores due to items being on both ordinal and continuous scales . Significant negative correlation between extra-curricular activities and extent of employment , r ( 491 ) = - .252 , p &lt; 0.01 was found ( See Table 1 ) . The higher the number of hours employed , the less students participated in extra-curricular activities . <p> Two items grouped for the socializing variable : 1 ) enjoyed socializing with other students , 2 ) having a social life was important . Cronbach 's alpha revealed reliability at .730 for these items . All factors were converted to z scores due to items being on both ordinal and continuous scales . Negative correlation between socializing and extent of employment was found , r ( 506 ) = - .162 , p &lt; 0.01 ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed , the less students enjoyed socializing and the less important it was to have a social life . <p> Relationship between Student Employment and Persistence toward a Degree <p> Three items grouped for persistence : 1 ) employment interfered with progress toward a degree or graduation date , 2 ) employment extended the amount of time to complete degree , and 3 ) employment decreased my priority to graduate on time . Reliability of .756 was found for these four items as determined by Cronbach 's alpha . Positive correlation between persistence toward a degree and extent of employment is shown in Table 1 , r ( 500 ) = .288 , p &lt; 0.01 . Persistence toward a degree increased with an increasing number of hours employed . Discussion <p> Findings indicate that the more a student is employed the more employment interferes with his/her study time and student time . Students are spending less time preparing for class than is recommended and that may be due to more students working and working a higher number of hours ( Young , 2002 ) . The finding that a students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works more hours is very consistent with recent research ( King and Bannon , 2002 ) . There is a curvilinear relationship with extent of employment and GPA 's in that students who did not work reported slightly lower GPA 's and were less satisfied than students who were employed 11-20 hours per week ( Furr and Elling , 2000 ) . This is an important relationship for students , parents , advisors , and faculty to understand . In advising/counseling students , students need to be made aware of the impact employment has on their grade point average to help them form more realistic expectations regarding employment . <p> This study did not find attendance to be significantly correlated with extent of work . This may be due to students planning their work and class schedules so they are in harmony . Although research was not found regarding extent of employment and family relationships , it seems to be logical that the more one is employed and attends school , the less one would have time to spend with his/her family or at least to stay in contact . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it was found that the more time a student spends on campus the more likely that student will succeed . Depending on the type of employment a student has , the student may actually find their job provides the socializing needed to stay connected . On the other hand , if a student 's employment requires long and/or late weekend hours , they may miss out on opportunities to get acquainted with other students . <p> The finding that extent of employment and persistence toward a degree were positively correlated was interesting and unusual . The explanation may be that these students who are employed higher number of hours are completely focused on the end result , graduation , and are doing all they can to graduate on time . Another explanation may be that those who work a higher number of hours per week have already dropped out and therefore were not available to be included in this study . <p> Additional insight into student employment was shared by some student comments . In response to the question , " Has being employed while a student affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes , I work two jobs ( anywhere from 20 to 28 hours a week , while going to school full time ) . If I did n't have to work so much I would be able to focus more on my school work and do a much better job . My current GPA is a 3.3 but it will probably drop this semester . " <p> " No , not at all . If anything , it has helped it . By having more going on in my daily schedule , I can use my time more wisely . " <p> " Knowing that I do carry two jobs and an internship , it 's been difficult . Actually , I 've seen my grade-point average go up , because with the jobs it 's taught me how to balance everything . If I had all the down-time , I believe I would see myself slacking off . <p> " I do n't think working for the university has affected my GPA at all . If anything it has helped because by having a job it forced me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own money having a job really helps . " <p> " Yes , it has helped me with a set schedule and getting things done when I can . Being employed has helped me for the better . " <p> " No . Actually , it has helped me learn how to budget my time . I have had a job since I started attending college , and my grades have always remained close to the same . The only benefit of having a job is the extra income ! " <p> In response to the question , " Has being employed while a student affected your interactions with friends ? or other family members ? " students shared the following : <p> " Yes , I do n't have as much time to hang out with my close friends , however sometimes when I just need a break I get away - I 'm willing to sacrifice some of my study time to hang out with a close friend about once or even twice a week . I really do n't get to catch up with my family until Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working or in class/studying . Half of my family lives out of state and I 'm lucky if I can even spare an hour once a week to chat with them . I usually only get to talk to them about 30 minutes a week on average . " <p> " I do not think it has affected my interactions with friends but it has affected my interactions with my family . I work an Saturdays and Sundays only , so it makes it difficult to go home for a weekend like I was able to do as a freshmen . My parents have come down and visited me , even though I ca n't visit them as often I would like . " <p> " The interesting thing about having a job is that it helps you deal with different kinds of people . Having a job where I interact with different kinds of people allows me to start up conversations with people who I normally would n't associate with . My family and friend relationships have always been strong , so having a job really has n't affected those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with friends better since I have more things to do and talk with them about and get their opinions . " <p> These unsolicited , qualitative responses are similar to the findings from the on-line survey . It is important that counselors , university student affairs professionals , secondary educators , Cooperative Extension faculty , parents , employers , college students , and employers have information related to the topic of student employment as employment can effect students both positively and negatively . For example , full-time work among full-time college students has risen sharply over the past 15 years . For these students , it may be prudent to consider additional avenues to finance college so students can complete their degrees in a timely manner , maintain their academic performance levels , and thereby reap the long-term benefits of a college education as expeditiously as possible ( Orszag , Orszag , &; Whitmore , 2001 ) . There is also a need to educate students on financial management so that students have the information necessary to make good financial decisions with the money they do have . Developing brochures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist current and future students , advisers , counselors and parents . Analysis of the costs and benefits of student employment , relative to individual personalities and situations , can assist current and future students to maximize their college experiences . <p> Implications for Further Research <p> Replication of this study at other institutions with a cross-section of students representing different areas of the United States could help identify differences among groups of students , geographically , ethically , and economically , and could lead to a better understanding of the extent of and impact of employment on college students . Future study addressing family relationships may reveal a relationship with extent of employment . Finally , the research that is available on extent of employment and its relationship to students is mostly quantitative in nature . Qualitative research could provide a more in-depth picture of student employment and could address the more detailed intricacies of the employed student and the relationship between student role , social interactions , family relationships , and persistence toward a degree . Such information would be highly valuable to students , parents , advisors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Student Employment with Student Role , Family Relationships , Social Interactions and Persistence PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> DIAGRAM : Figure 1 .
