Are there alternatives to shelving books in front of other books , boxing them for storage in the garage , or building a new wing ? Yes , declares Oakland architect Lindy Small , speaking for many designers : " Books can have an important presence in a home and do n't need to take up much space . " We asked design professionals and librarians for advice on housing large collections of books attractively , while still protecting them from damage . Here are their tips .

Then add 20 percent to allow space for books you 'll acquire . * Before you decide how to arrange your library , figure out which books your family uses most . For instance , children often need to get to reference books easily for schoolwork . Be sure these books are accessible . * Is there a room in your house that can do double duty as a library ? San Francisco architects Jose Vilar and Rebecca Hayden lined bookshelves on three sides of the dining room of the house they designed for David and Carolyn Goheen . If conversation at the dinner table turns to word definitions , literature , or geography , references are just a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , from the kitchen and utility room ( as long as you keep shelving away from sources of heat and moisture ) to the hallway , entry , and under-stair storage space . It may be possible to insert shelves between the studs , use a low freestanding bookshelf as a room divider , or convert side tables to shelved ones . Storing books in small closets with shelves is another workable solution . ' A library can be integrated into various parts of a home and still be expressive , " says Small . However , avoid bathrooms , laundry rooms , or spots that get lots of sun ( see " Keeping books safe , " right ) . * If you like solitude , you may want to create a library that 's a haven and a retreat . Then it 's time to remodel a home office or guest bedroom to include substantial shelving .

Match and extend any existing baseboard or cornice around the tops and bottoms of the new shelving . Add an attractive wood library ladder to help you reach books on the top shelves . * Shelves can take many forms . For a contemporary home , architect Sam Rodell of Spokane designed shelving that hangs from strong cables , making the shelves appear free-floating and high-tech . San Francisco designer Mark Desplaines created a hinged bookcase that doubles as a screen , which is available from Arkitektura In Situ in San Francisco . * Flexible shelving allows you to store books of different heights or to reconfigure when your book collection changes . This type of shelving usually employs movable brackets that fit into slots on metal strips or into rows of equally spaced holes , on the side and back panels of the shelving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 30 inches long and 12 inches deep . To allow you to see and reach books easily , put paperbacks toward the top on shallow shelves ( about 5 inches wide ) . Large heavy books should be placed on the stationary bottom shelf . For weighty loads of books on any other shelf or for extrawide spans , add wood framing underneath shelves to prevent warping. * For safety , especially in earthquake country , fasten freestanding bookcases to wall studs and install guardrails to keep books from tumbling out . Avoid storing books above a bed . * Use spotlights to illuminate art objects or particularly interesting books on your shelves . Keening books safe * Store books in places that are not damp or humid . That may mean taking them out of the basement , attic , or garage and putting them inside the home . " Ideally the humidity should not fall below 30 percent or be above 70 percent , " says Barclay Ogden , head of the preservation department for the libraries at the University of California at Berkeley * Prolonged exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has shelved books , filter or exclude the sun with blinds or curtains . * Similarly , tobacco smoke harms books , so try to protect your collection from smokers . * Dust can smudge pages . A good way to avoid this is to use bookcases with glass fronts . * As much as possible , store books with the spine facing out . If the spine faces up , the book can pull out of its cover , destroying the spine . * Do n't fold back pages to mark your place in a book . The paper fibers can weaken so that the corner of the page breaks off . * Newspaper clippings are acidic . If they 're left folded inside a book , they can leave marks on nearby pages .
