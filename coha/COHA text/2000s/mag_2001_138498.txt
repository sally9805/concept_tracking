THE CHECK arrived in a fancy envelope , and Tony Siragusa shuddered at his good fortune . It was a gift from the football gods , so Siragusa took the $1,000 signing bonus ( $674 after taxes ) he received from the Indianapolis Colts in the spring of 1990-his first NFL paycheck-and went straight to a bank in his hometown of Kenilworth , N.J. Though the bank had closed for the day , his aunt was the manager , and when he asked her to give him the entire sum in small bills , she happily obliged . Then , with a wallet nearly as thick as his midsection , Siragusa barged into Ross Brothers ' Tavern and slapped the wad of cash on the bar . " Then , " he recalls , " we drank it . Every last dollar bill . " // If there 's one story that captures the essence of Siragusa , the Baltimore Ravens ' wide-bodied , wisecracking , potbellied , potty-mouthed , bighearted , large-living defensive tackle , then scores of others serve the same purpose . The signing-bonus saga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , but Siragusa , 33 , has more material than he has bulk in his 6 ' 3 " , 342-pound body . When the Ravens face the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV , the Goose will be the biggest personality in the ultimate game , a man revered by teammates , reviled by some opponents and unrepentant about any feelings  --  or quarterbacks  --  he has injured along the way . // One evening last week in Pine Brook , N.J. , Siragusa took center stage as he and his paisans-including some who 11 years earlier had helped him drink away his signing bonus  --  had another celebration at another boisterous bar . Partying at Tiffany 's , however , required no wad of cash . Siragusa is a co-owner of the eatery and sports bar , which he and two partners opened in November . Thanks to a contract holdout last summer , Siragusa has earned more than $2 million this season , a salary he views as a validation of his lunch-bucket approach to football . // " My abilities were overlooked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a piece of the puzzle , " Siragusa said , his voice booming above the din . " When I was in college , people told me , ' Sure , you can stop the run , but anyone can do that . If you want to make money in the NFL , you 've got to rush the passer . ' That 's bull  --   --  . It 's like all the people who tell you you 've got to be in computers to make money . Yeah ? You know what  --  you still need a f  --   --  - plumber to fix your toilet , and the scarcer they are , the more money they 'll make . ' Cause what are you gon na do , call a f  --   --   --  computer guy to fix your f  --   --   --  crapper ? " // Everybody at the table  --  heck , everyone at the surrounding tables  --  burst into laughter , a common response when the Goose is on the loose . Siragusa is a salt-of-the-earth sage who can insult you in the loudest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the crowd . // Giants fans , beware . True , Siragusa was one of you once , growing up 20 miles from Giants Stadium , and his restaurant will be full of Ravens bashers come Super Sunday . Mindful of this quirk of fate , Siragusa went behind the Tiffany 's bar , mixed roughly 30 shots of a pink liquid he identified only as Goose Juice and passed them around the bar before raising his glass of beer . " Hey , here 's to the Giants ... , " he said , pausing long enough for patrons to exchange puzzled glances before he delivered the kicker , " ... kissing my ass ! " // Siragusa does n't suck up to anyone . Just ask Mike Gottfried , who in 1987 , his second year as Pitt 's coach , passed out copies of the school 's fight song at a team meeting . Siragusa , then a sophomore , crumpled his sheet and shouted , " If I wanted to learn a school song , I would 've gone to Notre Dame or Penn State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I came to Pitt . " // Siragusa has nothing good to say about Gottfried and has even less regard for former Colts director of football operations Bill Tobin , who ran the franchise during the last three of Siragusa 's seven years in Indianapolis ( 1990 to ' 96 ) . Siragusa detests Tobin for driving out Indy coach Ted Marchibroda with a low-ball contract offer after the team 's run to the ' 95 AFC title game . " We had a great thing going , and the guy dismantled it , " Siragusa says of Tobin , who is out of football . " Then he had the balls to refer to himself in the third person constantly . He 's horrible . " // Nor is Siragusa a fan of former Colts coach Lindy Infante , Tobin 's choice to succeed Marchibroda . " A d  --  - head loser , " Siragusa says . // The Goose is far more complimentary toward Ravens coach Brian Billick , though Siragusa 's relationship with team management became strained during last summer 's four-week holdout . Siragusa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raise and a contract extension , but the front office did n't budge . Word of a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum by the Ravens broke in the Baltimore papers on an August day on which Siragusa was relaxing with his wife , Kathy . four-year-old daughter , Samantha , and 17-month-old son , Anthony , at their beach house on the Jersey shore . When Billick called to smooth things over , Siragusa asked whether he was prepared to begin the Season with an inexperienced starter ( Lional Dalton ) and a free-agent pickup ( Sam Adams ) at the tackle positions . " Oh , I see , " Billick said . " It 's all about leverage now ? " // " Brian , " Siragusa howled , " it 's always been about leverage ! " ( Two weeks later he signed a three-year , $9-million contract. ) // On the field Siragusa , a state wrestling champion in high school , has turned leverage into an art form . " He 's a load , " says Pittsburgh Steelers guard Rich Tylski . " You 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into him and have a stalemate and have him try an arm tackle . " // Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger says Siragusa " plays a lot better than his appearance would suggest . " // To Steelers halfback Jerome ( the Bus ) Bettis , Siragusa is " the immovable object , the key to what they do . You need two guys to block him , and that allows Ray Lewis to run free , which is why Ray is so good . " // As tough as Siragusa is as a gap-plugger and run-stopper , he 's surprisingly adept at collapsing the pocket . His bull rush of Oakland Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon was a pivotal play in the AFC Championship Game on Jan. 14 . Early in the second quarter Siragusa broke through the middle and drove Gannon into the turf after Gannon had released the ball . Gannon was forced to leave the game with a separated left shoulder . Though Siragusa was not penalized on the play , the NFL fined him $10,000 for an illegal hit . " Listen , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . That 's how you get him out of his rhythm , " says Siragusa , who says he will appeal the fine . " It was n't a cheap shot . " // Siragusa has a mean streak . Asked to name his dirtiest opponent , he says , " Without a doubt Cincinnati Bengals guard Matt O'Dwyer . The last time we played them , I finally got fed up . I said , ' Listen , we 're destined to get an interception , and when we do , I 'm gon na take out your knee . ' After that , the bull  --   --  stopped . " // Still , most of Siragusa 's on-field banter takes on a comedic tone . Anyone who has heard Siragusa 's bawdy , unpredictable weekly radio show on Baltimore 's WJFK-AM knows that . He is the city 's modern incarnation of Artie Donovan , the Hall of Fame Baltimore Colts lineman whose devil-may-care humor cracks up David Letterman . In December , when Donovan joined Siragusa for a live radio broadcast in a crowded restaurant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button for the first time . // The Goose 's life has n't been entirely golden . In July 1989 , while recovering from a pair of blown-out knees he had suffered in his sophomore season at Pitt , Tony was staying at his parents ' house in Kenilworth when the screams of his mother , Rose , awakened him at 4 a.m . Tony and his older brother , Pete , rushed to their parents ' room . Their father , also named Pete , a 48-year-old cement mixer and part-time rock singer and guitarist , had had a heart attack . The boys attempted CPR , but to no avail . " We were crushed , " Tony says . " It changed my approach to life . From then on I was going to blaze a trail through the brush and go as hard and as fast as I could . " // Siragusa has had to fight for everything he 's gotten . At Pitt he earned spending money by hustling students at the campus pool hall . Signed by the Colts as an undrafted free agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach Ron Meyer that he was an experienced long-snapper . He still has that scrapper 's mentality . In October , following a first-quarter head-on collision with Titans fullback Lorenzo Neal , Siragusa was rushed to a Maryland hospital and found to have a bruised spinal cord . Within the hour , he shocked teammates by rushing back to the stadium , and soon after that he was back in the game . // Even Kathy , his 5 ' 1 " , 105-pound high school girlfriend and eventual wife , was n't easy to win over . " I was scared to death of him , " she recalls . " I was a nice girl , and I wanted to stay that way . I really did n't like him , but he kept coming back and saying , ' What do you mean you wo n't go out with me again ? ' He could n't fathom the idea that somebody did n't like him . Eventually , I got caught up in his whirlwind like everybody else . His objective in life is to enjoy every moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Three days after the AFC Championship Game , Siragusa stopped in for breakfast at Anthony 's , a hangout a few blocks from his childhood home in Kenilworth . The blue-collar , northern New Jersey town has 7,500 residents packed into two square miles . Some of the locals  --  Angelo , Pete , Junior , Sally , Preacher , Artie the Undertaker , Tony 's uncle Marty and a dozen others  --  were there to watch the Goose eat several sandwiches stuffed with what they call Taylor ham ( " More like pork roast , but you do n't want to know what 's really in it " one diner said ) and ham it up as only he can . // " Who you gon na go for in the Super Bowl ? " Siragusa asked Angelo , a Giants season-ticket holder for 41 years . " Do n't ask stupid questions , " Angelo responded . The Goose feigned indignation , then raised his left fist . " You 're lucky you have heart trouble , " Siragusa said , and Angelo and everyone else started laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Hey , " Siragusa-said , " I used to go to Giants games . Back then you were happy if you got a flat beer and a hot dog without a vein running down the middle . " // Take cover , America : Super Bowl week may never be the same .
