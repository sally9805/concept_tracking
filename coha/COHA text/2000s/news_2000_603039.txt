<p> The scene is repeated virtually every night on campuses across the country . <p> A sporting event is over , the visiting team wearily piles into 15-passenger vans for a 2-4-hour drive home . Frequently , the driver is the coach who is tired and still unwinding from the contest . Often , the athletes try to stretch out for a nap , leaving the seat belts stuffed under the cushion . <p> In good road conditions , it is a less-than-ideal mode of travel . In winter , it gives every college athletic administrator white knuckles . <p> " These are rolling tin cans , really . Nobody feels very comfortable about it , " says Jim Murphy , athletic director at Davidson ( N.C ) College . <p> Since Dec. 29 , five vans carrying college teams have crashed . Four students on Prairie View A &M's; indoor track team died last week when the van they were traveling in swerved out of control . Six others were injured in the accident in east Texas . Four earlier crashes , these on icy roads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenyon College swimmer and injuries to 32 others this winter . <p> Was it a coincidental string of accidents during a particularly bad stretch of weather ? Perhaps , though weather was not a factor in the most recent accident . <p> Consider that nearly a half-million athletes participate in college and junior-college sports in the USA , virtually every one making at least a couple of road trips a year . <p> But the recent cluster of accidents also highlights an issue that college athletic administrators grapple with constantly  --  providing safe transportation for growing sports programs under tight budgets . <p> With each accident , ADs around the country feel a stab in the heart that it happened  --  and a sigh of relief that it was n't their schools . <p> " It 's every athletic director 's worst nightmare , " says Dick Rasmussen , executive secretary of the University Athletic Association , a Division III conference . <p> " Everybody in college athletics has been in one of those vans , " says Doug Mosley , director of sports information for the National Association of Intercollegiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you have that many people making that many trips , the odds are going to catch up with you . We all hold our breath . " <p> Schools set policy <p> The National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) has no policy or guidelines for road travel by student-athletes . It feels it 's up to individual schools to set their own rules based on geography and the resources of the program . <p> Thus , the policies vary widely . <p> Some schools place strict distance or time limits for trips in university-owned vans , chartering a bus with a professional driver when the limits are exceeded . Some do n't . <p> Some schools allow students over the age of 21 to drive team vans . Some do n't . <p> Some require coaches , staff and student drivers to be certified , usually taking a half-day or day-long course in driving a van . Some do n't . <p> In general , schools are reluctant to use students as drivers but will permit it when necessary . Students were driving in three of the five recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they try to limit the one-day van trips to 100-200 miles . <p> But even when coaches drive , the trip back to campus can be a concern . " You do n't know how tired the coach might be , what kind of mood the coach is in , " says Mike Durbin , basketball coach at the College ofSt . Benedict in St. Joseph , Minn . " You 're replaying the game in your mind when you should be driving . It 's difficult to separate that . " <p> Every coach and administrator knows safety comes first . In practice , though , what 's safe is very subjective , and that judgment can be clouded by the pressures of meeting a conference schedule , expanding the program 's exposure beyond its region , staying within the budget . <p> " What you worry about is , ' Are budget constraints driving the policy ? ' " Murphy says . " You worry about a team coach pushing a little too hard to meet the budget . " <p> It does n't have to , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Division III women 's school with enrollment of 1,900 , charters buses for almost every road trip for each of its 12 teams . " It 's a stress I was so glad to be relieved of , " Durbin says . <p> The decision to keep the vans in the garage was made after the 1989 Muskingum College accident in which a van carrying the women 's basketball team collided with a tractor-trailer , killing two students . <p> " That really hit home to us . We brought the ( newspaper ) articles into a meeting , looked around the table and knew it could have been our names , " says Carol Howe-Veenstra , athletic director and volleyball coach at St. Benedict . " We 've all put athletes behind the wheel , we 've all driven when we were exhausted , by the nature of the beast . " <p> Howe-Veenstra estimates the switch from vans to charters increased transportation costs about $ 12,000 a year  --  a significant expenditure for an athletic department that receives $ 160,000 a year from the administration for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We eat a lot of pizza . We pack a lot of lunches ( for the trips ) , " she says . <p> Upgrading to buses <p> Kenyon , following the fatal accident involving its team , will hire chartered buses for all road events the rest of this year and is studying permanent changes . <p> Leon Lunder , athletic director of Carlton College in Northfield , Minn. , and president of the National Association of Div . III Athletic Administrators , estimates Div . III athletes take half their road trips in vans . Upgrading to a chartered bus for short- and medium-length trips is expensive . " For us to go to the Twin Cities , a 40-mile trip , it 's probably $ 50 to use a van and $ 500 to charter , " Lunder says . <p> Some suggest a middle step  --  buying 16-passenger buses that are heavier than vans with sturdier rollover protection . Besides the additional $ 6,000 or so in cost , however , many states require a commercial driver 's license to operate them . <p> And buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a third seriously injured in 1992 when a bus carrying the Notre Dame team flipped coming home from a meet at Northwestern . <p> A major problem , administrators admit , is that many athletes in the middle and back seats of the vans ignore the seat belts . <p> In the Kenyon College van , three of the 11 students were wearing seat belts , police said . Two were unhurt , and one suffered minor injuries . <p> " You can suggest and recommend , but it 's still an individual decision , just as it is in their own cars , " Durbin says . <p> So what can schools do ? <p> " Have a pretty rigid policy , " Murphy says . Davidson requires a charter bus for any one-day trip of more than four hours or if students are to return to campus from the event after midnight . <p> Other coaches and administrators say it 's important to stress the basics and give staff the option to change to a chartered bus if the weather is threatening . <p> The athletic staff at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , to review its policies . A memo was sent to every coach . " We 're just trying to reinforce the common-sense things , " says associate athletic director Budd Thalman , like wearing seat belts and getting off the road if conditions are dangerous . The department will figure out how to fit the night 's hotel bill into the budget . <p> Some administrators suggest smaller schools are too ambitious with their scheduling in the middle of winter . Some coaches complain there 's not enough money for buses , Lunder says , " but why are you traveling the distances you are ? " <p> As colleges study costs , risk management and the human element , they recognize it 's a matter of improving the odds of safety . <p> " We 're all vulnerable , " Murphy says . " You can have the best policy and accidents still happen . "
