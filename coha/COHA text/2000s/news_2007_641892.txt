<p> Because they inherited the basketball version of raw sludge , John Paxson and Scott Skiles have had free passes in Chicago . They are comped in restaurants and back-slapped on downtown streets for one reason : They fixed what Jerry Krause and Tim Floyd broke and made the Bulls relevant and fun again . But eventually , this arc to respectability must be power-driven by an ascent into the NBA elite . <p> Seems that rocket ship is stalling from bad gas . <p> The two old-school visionaries  --  once jump-shooting gym rats , now balding title aspirants  --  are facing their first team crisis . Without a low-post offensive force or dependable go-to shooter in the clutch , the Bulls might not be so trendy after all . If it is n't quite time to reach for the Prozac over an 0-3 start , it 's fair to point out that the Celtics are scary-real , the Eastern Conference is deeper and better and Paxson has n't done much to improve his team since the shoot-and-clank , six-game playoff ouster against the markedly superior Pistons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation , how mind-boggling to see Mad Pax walk on the wild side and chase Kobe Bryant , a drama that only has distracted his players in the same week that Luol Deng and Ben Gordon rejected long-term extensions and clouded their futures . Momentum has followed Paxson and Skiles for years . For the first time , their equilibrium is encountering a queasy sensation . <p> " We 're in our customary last place , " Skiles quipped Monday . <p> " It 's no fun when you 're losing , " Kirk Hinrich said . " You do n't want to go out in public . I 've had trouble sleeping . " <p> What was so exciting about the Bulls as they returned from the dregs  --  hustling kids who relied on heart , floor burns and jump shots  --  now appears to be passe and so 2006 . We 're wondering how they 'll reach the next level , a fair demand in a town that waited eight years for a playoff berth and nine for a postseason series victory since the relentless , unforgettable theater of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have brought a chilling comedown for those who actually assumed a championship was nearing . Suddenly , the Bulls ca n't shoot , ca n't rebound , do n't hustle and do n't play defense . Deng , so valued by the Bulls and Lakers ( and Kobe ) that a potential blockbuster deal crashed , has looked overhyped and worn out by the buzz . Hinrich continues to damage his defensive reputation but courting nightly foul trouble  --  and has n't been backed by Skiles , who told his captain to look in the mirror instead of blaming officials . Gunner Ben Gordon remains the same defensive liability and was embarrassed at New Jersey on opening night , when his chance to be like Bryant and win a game at the buzzer turned into a deflected jumper and an overtime loss . At least Ben Wallace has the excuse of a sprained ankle for his lame efforts , but three rebounds a game is n't why he 's paid $15 million a year . <p> SAD COMMENTARY <p> These sluggish , sloppy , uninspired performances have been accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skiles and the players have been downright disturbing : <p> " It 's a little shocking , " Gordon said . " This is the NBA . Nothing 's going to be given to you . You have to show up . " <p> " It 's the second game in a row where we had great difficulty getting back on defense and , frankly , it does n't look like we care about it too much , either , " Skiles said . " Pretty distressing . " <p> " I do n't know why we had no energy , but we did n't , " Deng said . " Tonight was just a horrible performance out there . " <p> " We looked frightened , " Skiles said . <p> " We are n't playing with any kind of composure on offense , " Hinrich said . " We 're helter-skelter . We need to do a better job of playing together . " <p> Remember , this is a team assessed by some as ready to leapfrog into the NBA Finals . But anyone who has closely watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gordon and Hinrich , two smallish guards miscast as the so-called next Chauncey Billups and Rip Hamilton . Deng has become almost a myth amid the national hysteria of the Bryant deal , elevated from his realistic rep as an emerging All-Star into this superstar-like force that Bryant demanded had to stay in Chicago . All three are fine players , but it 's absurd to think Deng can morph into a scoring machine by becoming more assertive , as someone foolishly wrote Monday . They are supporting cast members . The Bulls still need a megastar , someone who not only wants the final shot but can make it with haunting regularity . <p> TRADE TALK WO N'T STOP <p> Why do you think Paxson was courting Bryant , anyway ? Why do you think he 'll continue to court him ? Answer : As constituted , the Bulls ca n't win an NBA title , but with Bryant and the right accompanying parts , they 'll have a shot down the road . Once his Kobe interest became public , Paxson ran the risk of demoralizing players who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conquer the NBA . Coupled with rejections by Deng and Gordon of $50-million extension offers  --  a lowball on the part of Bulls management , given current market value  --  what you have here are cluttered minds and jarred egos . Deng knows the Bryant talks are anything but dead , despite Paxson 's attempts to shut down rumors late last week . <p> " It 's not going to stop . You can tell Kobe does n't want to be in L.A. , so it 's probably going to come up again , " Deng said . " With a player like Kobe , a lot of teams are really trying to see what they can do with that . So most likely , it might come up again . " <p> " I think it 's been a distraction , " Gordon said . " Players ' names are mentioned all the time . It 's natural for you to think about it . It 's a part of the business . You just have to take it and keep moving . What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems like the Bulls are playing in slow motion . The other night , some fans chanted Bryant 's name at the United Center , prompting rookie Joakim Noah to respond Monday as only he can . " For some of the fans to go and talk about Kobe  --  like screaming , ' Kobe ! '  --  to me , that was kind of different because they would n't do that in college , " he said .
