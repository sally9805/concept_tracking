The Puzzle Bark Tree By Stephanie Gertler Dutton Prologue One night , before Grace went to sleep , she asked her . Sit down on my bed , Grace said . Sit down just this once . I have the same kind of dream all the time , Mom . Melanie and I are on a ship and the ship is tossing in the night . A hole is gaping through the hull and icy water is pouring in and coming up to our knees and then rushing past our waists . Faster and faster . And I scream for someone to help us . You 're there but you wo n't save us and you swim away . I need to ask you , Mom , if Melanie and I were on a ship , and the ship was tossing in the night and there was a hole gaping through the hull and water was pouring in so that it came up to our knees faster and faster , could n't you save us ? Would n't you save us both ? Her mother looked at Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her chin . Her mother 's eyes became wide . She looked almost startled , blinking in what appeared to be disbelief . Looking into her mother 's eyes frightened Grace more than the dream of the ship sinking in the darkness . When her mother finally spoke , her voice was raised and trembling . What a foolish question , her mother said . Stupid question . That is a cruel and selfish question , Grace Hammond . Why would you think about such things ? How could you ask such a thing ? Her mother moaned . She inhaled a breath so rasping and deep Grace was n't sure what would happen when she let it go . Her mother clasped her hands , then released them , wrung them and twisted them in a way that frightened Grace and made her wonder if her mother would tear them off her wrists . Grace wailed that she did n't mean anything by her question . I was only wondering , Grace apologized , pleading for mercy . Her mother left her seat at the edge of Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , leave it on and leave the door cracked open , Grace begged . But her mother just walked away , as though she were an apparition in the darkness . There were so many nights , when Grace was a child , that she dreamed of ships and boats rocking to and fro on metal-gray waves . She was probably around six years old the first time she had the dream . It was n't until she was ten when Grace found the courage to confess the dream to her mother . The dream recurred over and over again after that . A boat , sometimes a ship , rocking violently on steely dun water that splashed over the deck and soaked Grace 's clothes so they clung to her like onionskin . And , in all the dreams , Grace and Melanie would call out for help , their cries trapped somewhere deep inside their throats , down to their chests , though their mouths were poised to cry . Grace 's daughter , Kate , asked the same sort of thing when she was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a dream . It was simply one of those questions that children ask , like why is the sky blue and is there really a man on the moon and why do n't we fall off the edge of the earth as it spins ? Kate called Grace back to her bed one night after Grace had tucked her in and read Anne of Green Gables for the umpteenth time . If you and Daddy and I were on a desert island and you could only save one , whom would you rescue ? Kate asked , her eyes imploring . And Grace answered , ignoring her own sense of something arcane as Kate posed her question . " I would save us all , " Grace said matter-of-factly . " I would save us all . " " But you can only save one , " Kate said . " That 's the rule . " " I would break the rule . " Grace smiled , lifting her chin triumphantly . She enveloped her daughter so tightly that Kate laughed and said she was squeezing her too hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , just like so many mornings , Grace wondered why it never occurred to her own mother to simply gather Grace up in her arms and say she would save them both .
