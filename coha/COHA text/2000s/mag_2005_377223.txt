The term identity theft may conjure up notions of cyberhacks and Internet scams , but most ID fraud , it turns out , starts off-line . Last year 9.3 million Americans were victims of identity fraud , a problem that cost consumers and businesses some $52 billion . But fewer than 12% of cases start online , according to a survey by Javelin Strategy &; Research and the Better Business Bureau . Most ID theft has an old-fashioned beginning : a lost wallet , stolen mail or a friend or relative with easy access to financial information . Another finding : People who monitor accounts online catch fraud earlier and minimize the damage . While the average loss for fraud detected by paper statements was $4,543 , it was just $551 for such crimes discovered online .  --  By Barbara Kiviat
