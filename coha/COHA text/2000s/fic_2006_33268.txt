Chapter One An Aurochs in the Works It all began with the aurochs . We were having breakfast in our rooms at college . Simon was presiding over the able with his accustomed critique on the world as evidenced by the morning 's paper . " Oh , splendid , " he sniffed , " it looks as if we have been invaded by a pack of free-loading foreign photographers keen on exposing their film-and who knows what else-to the exotic delights of Dear Old Blighty . Lock up your daughters , Bognor Regis ! European paparazzi are loose in the land ! " He rambled on awhile , and then announced : " Hold on ! Have a gawk at this ! " He snapped the paper sharp and sat up straight-an uncommon posture for Simon . " Gawk at what ? " I asked idly . This thing of his-reading the paper aloud to a running commentary of facile contempt , scorn , and sarcasm , well-mixed and peppered with his own unique blend of cynicism-had long since ceased to amuse me . I had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This saved having to pay attention to his tirades , eloquent though they often were . " Some bewildered Scotsman has found an aurochs in his patch . " " You do n't say . " I dipped a corner of toast triangle into the molten center of a soft-boiled egg , and read an item about a disgruntled driver on the London Underground refusing to stop to let off passengers , thereby compelling a trainfull of frantic commuters to ride the Circle Line for over five hours . " That 's interesting . " " Apparently the beast wandered out of a nearby wood and collapsed in the middle of a hay field twenty miles or so east of Inverness . " Simon lowered the paper and gazed at me over the top . " Did you hear what I just said ? " " Every word . Wandered out of the forest and fell down next to Inverness-probably from boredom , " I replied . " I know just how he felt . " Simon stared at me . " Do n't you realize what this means ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a phone call . Big deal . " I took a sip of coffee and returned to the sports page before me . " I would n't call it news exactly . " " You do n't know what an aurochs is , do you ? " he accused . " You have n't a clue . " " A beast of some sort-you said so yourself just now , " I protested . " Really , Simon , the papers you read- " I flicked his upraised tabloid with a disdainful finger . " Look at these so-called headlines : ' Princess Linked to Alien Sex Scheme ! ' and ' Shock Horror Weekend for Bishop with Massage Parlor Turk ! ' Honestly , you only read those rags to fuel your pessimism . " He was not moved . " You have n't the slightest notion what an aurochs is . Go on , Lewis , admit it . " I took a wild stab . " It 's a breed of pig . " " Nice try ! " Simon tossed his head back and laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to deride someone 's ignorance . Simon was extremely adept at derision ; a master of disdain , mockery , and ridicule in general . I refused to be drawn . I returned to my paper and stuffed the toast into my mouth . " A pig ? Is that what you said ? " He laughed again . " Okay , okay ! What , pray tell , is an aurochs , Professor Rawnson ? " Simon folded the paper in half and then in quarters . He creased it and held it before me . " An aurochs is a sort of ox . " " Why , think of that , " I gasped in feigned astonishment . " An ox , you say ? It fell down ? Oh my , what wo n't they think of next ? " I yawned . " Give me a break . " " Put like that it does n't sound like much , " Simon allowed . Then he added , " Only it just so happens that this particular ox is an ice-age creature which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Extinct . " I shook my head slowly . " Where do they get this malarkey ? If you ask me , the only thing that 's extinct around here is your native skepticism . " " It seems the last aurochs died out in Britain sometime before the Romans landed-although a few may have survived on the continent into the sixth century or so . " " Fascinating , " I replied . Simon shoved the folded paper under my nose . I saw a grainy , badly printed photo of a huge black mound that might or might not have been mammalian in nature . Standing next to this ill-defined mass was a grim-looking middle-aged man holding a very long , curved object in his hands , roughly the size and shape of an old-fashioned scythe . The object appeared to be attached in some way to the black bulk beside him . " How bucolic ! A man standing next to a manure heap with a farm implement in his hands . How utterly homespun , " I scoffed in a fair imitation of Simon himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the aurochs and the implement in the farmer 's hands is one of the animal 's horns . " I looked at the photo again and could almost make out the animal 's head below the great slope of its shoulders . Judging by the size of the horn , the animal would have been enormous-easily three or four times the size of a normal cow . " Trick photography , " I declared . Simon clucked his tongue . " I am disappointed in you , Lewis . So cynical for one so young . " " You do n't actually believe this- " I jabbed the paper with my finger , " this trumped-up tripe , do you ? They make it up by the yard-manufacture it by the carload ! " " Well , " Simon admitted , picking up his teacup and gazing into it , " you 're probably right . " " You bet I 'm right , " I crowed . Prematurely , as it turned out . I should have known better . " Still , it would n't hurt to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tea , and drained it . Then , as if his mind were made up , he placed both hands flat on the tabletop and stood . I saw the sly set of his eyes . It was a look I knew well and dreaded . " You ca n't be serious . " " But I am perfectly serious . " " Forget it . " " Come on . It will be an adventure . " " I 've got a meeting with my adviser this afternoon . That 's more than enough adventure for me . " " I want you with me , " Simon insisted . " What about Susannah ? " I countered . " I thought you were supposed to meet her for lunch . " " Susannah will understand . " He turned abruptly . " We 'll take my car . " " No . Really . Listen , Simon , we ca n't go chasing after this ox thing . It 's ridiculous . It 's nothing . It 's like those fairy rings in the cornfields that had everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , I ca n't go-I 've got mark to do , and so have you ! " " A drive in the country will do you a world of good . Fresh air . Clear the cobwebs . Nourish the inner man . " He walked briskly into the next room . I could hear him dialing the phone and , a moment later , he said , " Listen , Susannah , about today ... terribly sorry , dear heart , something 's come up ... Yes , just as soon as I get back ... Later ... Yes , Sunday , I wo n't forget ... cross my heart and hope to die . Cheers ! " He replaced the receiver and dialed again . " Rawnson here . I 'll be needing the car this morning ... Fifteen minutes . Right . Thanks , awfully . " " Simon ! " I shouted . " I refuse ! " ( Continues ... )
