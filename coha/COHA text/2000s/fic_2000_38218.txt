DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER 'S SUICIDE , twenty-five-year-old Adriane Gelki determined to lose her virginity to her boss , Garrett Hughes , and she went about preparing for this the same way she had , ten years earlier , found God : She read up on it . She read Kinsey , Hite , even de Sade . She studied the illustrated Kama Sutra . She visited newsstands and brought home copies of Big Muff , Biker Lover , and Cherries Jubilee and immersed herself in back issues of an erotic journal called Nippleodeon . She was intent not merely to have herself deflowered but to revive Mr. Hughes , who had suffered a terrible ordeal . <p> Finally , after a long sick leave , he returned to city hall-hobbling on crutches . It was a cold November Thursday ; he kept to his office and was bent over some files when Adriane peeked in on him that afternoon . Half his face was still bruised the color of Tropical Swirl sherbet . <p> " Come happy hour , " Adriane proposed , " I 'm buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though he was older than she was , " young man . " He gave her a look of such childlike gratitude that she thought about making a move on him right then . <p> The Spanish restaurant on the next corner had great tapas for happy hour , and today the steam trays offered herb-battered calamari , fried goat cheese in marinara sauce , and creamed crabmeat in pastry shells-all tempting , all bad for her . Restraint , Adriane had read somewhere , was " the highest expression of power , " but this evening she was going for something altogether different : Fuck it , she thought , and assembled a generous plate for each of them . <p> His crutches leaning against the bar , Mr. Hughes picked at his food and needed pestering to sip his martini . <p> " Would talking about it help ? " she asked . <p> " Maybe . " The flesh around his mouth , usually a bit lax , remained taut . His fourteen-year-old stepson had recently fallen off the roof at home , and Mr. Hughes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . The boy was still in the hospital and , in the future , would almost certainly be confined to a wheelchair . <p> " The sound his bones made- " Mr. Hughes shuddered . <p> " How 's your wife handling this ? " Adriane asked , though she already had some idea from an offhand remark he 'd made a week earlier on the phone . <p> " Things were strained before the accident . Now she 'll barely talk to me . " <p> " How unfair , " Adriane said , hoping to have summoned the right inflection . <p> " She did n't want me coming here to talk with you , either . " <p> " Perhaps you should have been a little discreet , " she murmured . <p> There had always existed a mild flirtatiousness between Adriane and Garrett , and it pleased her to think that his wife noticed and minded . <p> " What 's there to be discreet about ? " he said obtusely . <p> Adriane decided not to press the point . " Does she blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I blame me . " <p> " How unfair , " she said again . <p> " She does n't have to be fair . Her son ca n't walk . " <p> " Does she want to lose her husband , too ? " <p> This was meant to sound supportive , but he glanced away , offended perhaps at the suggestion that he could leave his wife . Adriane put a hand on his cast , over the red heart his stepdaughter had drawn . He looked so haggard ; Adriane wanted to bathe him in her Jacuzzi , press hot towels to his face , massage him back to life . <p> " So , " she said-a new tack- " who do you like on Sunday ? " <p> He eyed her curiously . " Sunday ? " <p> " Football . " Adriane had always watched NFL football with her father until she was fifteen . She 'd taken it up again this season . <p> " I never watch it . " <p> " Wow . Good for you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and nodded toward his martini . " Bottoms up . " <p> He 'd ridden the bus to work because his cast prevented him from driving , and Adriane offered to take him home . She pulled her car in front of the restaurant , so he would n't have to crutch very far , and leapt out to open the door for him . <p> " I have a detour in mind , " she said once they were underway , her breath shamefully visible in the cold . Mr. Hughes gave her a skeptical look when she stopped in front of her Mount Vernon apartment , a stately , down-at-the-heels building . Her mother and father had moved the family here when Adriane was three . Then Adriane lived here with just her mother , and , recently , by herself . She led her boss into the dingy elevator , then along the narrow carpeted hallway to her door . <p> " You 're not planning to kiss me , are you ? " he asked as she jiggled her key in the lock . He sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I might be planning something like that . " <p> " So that 's why you urged discretion . " He sighed deeply and then admitted , " Maybe just a kiss . I could use a kiss . " <p> " Then you shall have your kiss . " <p> " Just a kiss could n't hurt , " he mumbled , following her past the scuffed Steinway that took up half her living room . " How did they ever get that in here ? " he asked . <p> " It was my mother 's , " she said , leading him toward the bedroom , the only room that felt completely hers . " I 'll never be able to move . " <p> " I 'm sorry I could n't come to her memorial service . " <p> " You were in traction , " she observed . <p> They approached the beaded curtain that had served as her bedroom door since she was three . She parted an opening for Garrett , who faltered a moment , then entered ever so gingerly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adriane had changed the sheets that morning , bought roses for the end-table vase the day before . Folding her coat , she laid it on a green leather ottoman and did the same with his ; she then sat him on the edge of her bed and neatly slid the crutches underneath . <p> She loosened his tie and clasped her hands around the back of his neck and pressed her fingers along the knotted muscles that ran toward the base of his skull . Moving her hands to his face , she caressed his furrowed forehead and temples and cheekbones and was surprised to note the oiliness of tears under her fingers . She kissed one of the tears and went on to brush her lips across the entire surface of his bruised face . <p> Over the past few days , she could n't stop hearing in her head that balmy Marvin Gaye tune " Sexual Healing . " She hummed it now as she lit a candle , turned off the light , and began to ease Garrett out of his trousers , which snagged over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hands , so unaware did he seem of her actions , but she worked gently and persistently . From her bedside drawer she produced a condom . She placed it over his penis and , using her mouth , rolled it down the first timid inch of him-attempting to translate a skill she 'd perfected on zucchini . She glanced up and saw him looking at her with wide-eyed distress . <p> " Is this such a good idea ? " he whispered , as though he had only now considered his nakedness . <p> She nodded emphatically and imagined herself as the Florence Nightingale of Oral Comfort . <p> " It might be hard to take back , " he said . <p> " Why would you want to do that ? " she asked , vaguely insulted . <p> " Do n't you ever wish you could take things back ? " <p> " No , " she insisted . She eyed the plaid flannel pajamas her mother had given her . They were peeking slyly from beneath the pillow , mocking her with their primness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the pajamas into the bathroom . They belonged to another era of her life , the Age of Reactionary Chastity , and had no place in this , the Age of Conscientious Seduction . ( Certainly she would never have considered seduction , conscientious or otherwise , while her mother was alive to comment on it . Adriane had resolutely avoided the whole issue of sexuality for as long as her mother was still in the picture . ) She tossed the pajamas into the metal wastebasket , splashed them with nail-polish remover , and set them on fire . <p> Flames exploded from the trash can-as though Adriane had opened the door to a small blast furnace-singeing the delicate hairs along her wrist . She gasped and turned on the exhaust fan . By now the blaze had settled into a regular rhythm as it consumed the flannel . They 're not even flame-retardant , she noted with a dour sense of self-preservation . As she undressed , she glanced at herself moodily in the unflattering light that her mother was able to cast even from beyond the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out . <p> " No . Nothing , " she shouted , and then chimed stupidly , " secret girl thing . " <p> Back in the bedroom , she straddled him , eager to awaken his passion . His face thawed as she hovered over him , and his hands came to life , caressing her stomach , tracing a finger around her navel , though she could n't help notice that he was nowhere near erect . Adriane was unprepared for this ; her heartbeat squirmed inside a fist of failure . All her technical reading deserted her , and she could think only to grind herself against his pelvis , which elicited from him a moan that made her shiver , it echoed with so much sorrow . <p> " Come on , " she coaxed . " Up and in me . " She nipped at his earlobes and squeezed her legs against his flanks , as though he were a recalcitrant trail horse . After a few more unsuccessful minutes , she dismounted . <p> " A regrettable performance , " Garrett Hughes told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absurd . " She made herself laugh breezily . Silently she vowed to arouse him more completely some other time , for his own good . <p> At least , she thought as she drove him home , his face looked peaceful and younger , released from some of the grief that had recently held him . She had pulled him back toward life , at a time when his wife was unwilling or unable to . Adriane felt mildly proud of herself . <p> They shook hands and said good-night . <p> Later , before going to sleep , she said her nightly prayers . She had not been raised religious . But ten years ago , after her father 's grisly murder , Adriane had retreated into an urgent spiritual quest . She read everything she could find-the Upanishads , the Koran , Bible comics  --  and cobbled together a theology from the eightfold path , the five dispositions , the ten commandments , the Sermon on the Mount , and various other acknowledgments of virtue , temperance , and righteousness . She began to attend a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early on , she pictured a compassionate cloud . And then the Milky Way or sometimes a flock of geese , a pear blossom . Once , the Autobahn appeared to her in a dream . Intellectually she resisted patriarchal images , and yet her favorite and most compelling idea of God was of an old man 's ear , disembodied and hurtling through the cosmos . Cradled along the warm , curved rim lay Adriane , her naked body comfortably supported by a slope of pink flesh , her head resting on a pillow of the softest silver ear hair . She had only to whisper , or even just to think , for her most personal self to be heard throughout the universe . <p> Dear Gentle Listener , she began now . Please apologize to Moses for me the next time You see him , but I hope You Yourself will be openminded about tonight . Garrett is a decent man . I 'm sure he 'd never want to hurt his wife , but he needs this , he needs me , and I for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small measure of good in this world , though I guess my technique needs polish . As You know , I have been saving myself for a worthy occasion , not to mention a little maneuvering room . That someone like Garrett should need me so soon after my mother 's passing , well , it 's a clear sign , and I thank You for not beating around the bush . Truly , I feel on the verge of unleashing a great force , and I want to use it wisely . Well , anyway , my picks for Sunday : Vikings , Bengals , ' Skins , and Raiders . Whatever You can do .... <p> At work late the next afternoon , a messenger delivered flowers to her desk : a small arrangement of geraniums growing out of a ceramic planter with the words home and hearth painted on it and no card . Passing secretaries eyed the gift with indiscriminate envy , but the arrangement looked funereal to Adriane , who had seen enough such flowers at her mother 's memorial service . <p> Several times during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced at the flowers and pretended to have no connection to them , which she found sweetly coy . And that inapt planter : such an oversight ; how male , how like her father . <p> The next Thursday , Adriane took Garrett straight to her apartment after work . He paused as she parted the beaded curtain for him , and his forehead creased . " That sound- " he said . <p> She undressed both of them , and then , curious to try the missionary position , which seemed the bread and butter of most people 's sex lives , she pulled him on top of her , wanting to feel his weight . But as he lay there , his forehead creased even more deeply and his eyes clouded over . She asked if his leg was uncomfortable . When he did n't answer , she remembered that he had landed on top of his stepson . <p> " That 's the sound , " he said , " of his bones crunching . That curtain . " He rolled off her , hobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , parted them again . " He could have died , just in that splitsecond . I was sure he had , " he said , his back to her . " You 'd think life and death would be separated by a big , solid door . Oak . But they 're not . " He blew on the beads and made them rustle . " This is all that separates life and death . " <p> " Life 's on this side , " she beckoned . <p> He turned and stood before her , naked except for his cast . " I was angry with him . Shortly before we fell . " <p> " So what ? " <p> " What if I did n't reach fast enough ? Maybe I could have saved him . " <p> " It was an accident . There was nothing you could do . " <p> " He 's not showing any progress . " <p> " You have no responsibility here . " <p> " What if I might ? " <p> " An accident . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife beat you up about it . " <p> " She 's not beating me , " he said . " It 's more like she 's been beaten . I try to touch her and she flinches . She has no reason to be afraid of me . " <p> " Of course not , " said Adriane . <p> Using his bound foot , he spread open his underpants on the floor , then stepped into both leg holes before reaching to pull the briefs up . " I love her , " he said . <p> " Uh-huh . " She watched him struggle with his pants and tried to think of something to impede his leaving . " Why ? " she asked . <p> He buckled his belt and sat next to her on the bed . " You want to know why I love her ? " <p> " Sure , " she said , trying not to feel jealous . " What the hell . " <p> " Um , " he began , " I know that I first started to love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember thinking , There 's someone who really knows how to love . " <p> " Lots of people know how to love , " said Adriane , though she did n't truly believe that and did n't even know many people , period . She wondered what sort of loving glow she herself might radiate toward children , and was not encouraged . Children , her mother had taught her long ago , were who you blamed for your own unhappiness . <p> " You 've been to our house , " he said . " Did you notice the gazebo in the backyard ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " May-Annlouise wanted that house because of the gazebo . " <p> " You can buy them at Hechingers for a few hundred dollars , " she said , for the sake of argument . <p> " I know . But she liked this one because the bench had a knothole and she looked through it and saw a cat's-eye marble in the grass underneath . It had been left behind by the previous family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and that it meant we belonged there . And she truly believes that-maybe not that the marble is really watching , but- " <p> " But what ? " <p> " Well ... that something as small as a marble in the grass can make you feel at home . " His voice drifted off , and Adriane bet he was still thinking about how much he loved his wife for raving about that stupid marble . Why could n't people keep their mysticism to themselves ? Adriane , after all , did n't blab about her Gentle Listener , who provided the only sense of belonging she felt in the world . Certainly she had lived in this dreary apartment almost all her life without it feeling like home . <p> " Then she sat on my lap in that gazebo and began to kiss me , very gently , but passionately . I mean , we 'd been married for years already , you know ? These very charming , lovely kisses that must have gone on for a quarter hour . . . . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " The real estate agent was right there in the kitchen , " he said ingenuously . <p> She sighed and studied his smooth chin . " You 've been a good boy all your life , I 'm guessing . " <p> Again that look of gratitude from him ; it seemed to thank her for recognizing his innocence . <p> " You know , " she went on , " I 've been a good girl . " <p> " I 'm sure you have . " He did not sound convinced . <p> She wanted just then to make him beg for her and whatever depravity she might cook up . It frightened her , the bitterness of this urge , and after taking him home she approached the subject in her bedtime prayers . <p> OK , she began , I admit I was n't expecting him to still love her , though he probably just said that out of guilt . I mean , if he loves her , why would he spend Thursday nights with me ? Right ? Am I right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get jealous back there , but as long as my heart 's mission is virtuous , I do n't think it matters that he 's married or that he might not be free to love me any time in the foreseeable future . <p> By the way , Dallas and I thank You . My bookie says I 'm breaking his balls , but if he 's reaching for more than his vig , then he deserves to get them squeezed . No one likes a greedy middleman . Amen . <p> That Friday morning a new pot of geraniums was delivered to her desk , this one with a little kitchen scene painted on the side and still no card , which was getting irritating . Last week 's somewhat faded flowers stared at her like a gathering of wizened faces ; the fresh ones watched her too , with more cheer and hope . It bothered her to share such a fetish , this need to feel watched over , with May-Annlouise . Still , Adriane very much wanted to think of the flowers as Garrett 's affectionate way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmic Marble , so to speak , toward her . A half-hour later , he walked by and remarked , " You seem to have a very tenacious admirer . " <p> " I inspire tenacious admiration . " <p> " Ah . " He smiled enigmatically and returned to his office . <p> Something was not right . Acting out an impulse she 'd subdued for the past week , she placed a call to the florist . She learned that the arrangements were charged to the joint credit card of Garrett and his wife . She wondered why he would be so reckless-did n't he care if May-Annlouise knew ? - and allowed these darker thoughts to preoccupy her morning . <p> At lunchtime she could stand it no longer and looked into his office . He was sitting in a beam of sunlight so strong it seemed to illuminate every bruise and wrinkle on his face . The sight released in Adriane an overflow of yearning . He was a good twelve years older than she , and she wondered if that was why she had dedicated her attentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other girls had gone down that road . Did this make her heart 's mission any less virtuous ? Adriane did not see why it should . " By the way , " she whispered , " thanks for all the flowers . " <p> " They 're not from me . " Again that uncertain smile . " I was going to ask what other gentlemen friends you had . " <p> Backing out of the room , she managed a sickly grin and shrugged . <p> Adriane knew a mind-fuck when she saw one and was not about to let this go unanswered . She called the florist again and ordered an identical arrangement to be sent immediately to May-Annlouise at her workplace . <p> Why did Garrett feel compelled to tell his wife whenever he spent time with Adriane ? And how many details had May-Annlouise dragged out of'him ? Adriane was livid . She believed there ought to be a commandment against people like May-Annlouise Hughes . <p> " And on the note ? " asked the florist . <p> Adriane hated notes , but hated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , " she snapped . " I mean , it should say , Leave me alone . " ' <p> On the past six Sundays , Adriane had been indulging her desire to watch pro football , an infatuation long forbidden by her mother . That was surely part of the attraction , and perhaps the sport also provided Adriane a harmless , even pleasant diversion from her mother 's recent death , and why should n't it ? <p> Around eleven AM , after phoning her bookie and placing her bets , Adriane faced the interminable wait before kickoff . It was an awkward length of time , too brief to go to church , but long enough for the walls of her apartment to start closing in . <p> She approached the large piano crowding her living room and decided it might look better against the far corner . Heaving herself against its dark bulk , she managed to roll it a foot to the left . Last week she had moved it two feet to the right . These repositionings had been her only contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , had been her mother 's foremost language , the only way she could express herself with any beauty or grace , and in the end it had failed her . <p> Someone was knocking on Adriane 's door . She saw beyond her peephole a wide-angle distortion of May-Annlouise . Christi Did n't she get the flowers ? Could n't she read ? Adriane recoiled at the thought of suffering the older woman 's pious outrage-recoiled even as she hurriedly unlocked the deadbolt and flung open the door . The women stood on either side of the threshold , each waiting for the other to speak first . <p> Finally , Adriane issued an invitation inside and , as a pretense at politeness , went on to offer hot chocolate . Surprisingly , May-Annlouise said she would have some . She then hung her coat on a peg in the hallway and leaned against the kitchen wall , her arms folded in front of her . Her face was puffy and red , and her eyes quivered . She looked even worse than Garrett had a couple weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May-Annlouise took a sip , spilled a little on her sweater , sipped some more . " Garrett has always thought highly of you , " she said . <p> Adriane suspected a disarming ploy and tried to quell her desire to hear what high things he 'd thought about her . " That 's nice , " she said coolly . " He 's the only person in the entire city government whose opinion I respect . " <p> " There must be a few others . " <p> " Not really , " Adriane said . " I dislike most people . " <p> The two of them tried to stare each other down . At last MayAnnlouise asked , " What are you doing with my husband ? " <p> " I would n't be doing anything with him , " Adriane blurted , " if he was happy at home . " <p> May-Annlouise squinted at her . " Right . " And then her face seemed slowly to break up , like the ancient continents drifting apart , seas pouring into the spaces between . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , and at the bottom of it was loss , pure and hopeless . <p> Adriane leaned away , frightened . " Hey , please do n't cry . That 's not fair . Come on , please ? " she whispered . May-Annlouise continued to stare in agony . " Are you getting some counseling ? " Adriane asked . " Do you have a pastor or someone you can talk to ? " Only a choked silence from May-Annlouise . <p> " This is beyond me , " Adriane said . She took back the mug , carried it to the sink , and washed it thoroughly . The hot water over her wrists reminded her of the one resource at her disposal , the Jacuzzi in her bathroom , her single lunatic luxury that in the end , it seemed , had saved her life a couple of times . " Come on , " she said , leading May-Annlouise by the hand . <p> Adriane turned on the taps , added bubbles , and found a fresh towel , then fired up the gurgling machinery-a dinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an outboard motor , but still could sometimes work magic . She turned to May-Annlouise . " You 'll be all right ? " <p> Perceiving a slight nod , Adriane beat a retreat to the living room , where she turned the TV on-and then off . Not even the pregame shows , with their grating yammer , had begun . She threw herself against the piano till it moved a few more inches left , but it still overwhelmed the room . <p> Ten minutes passed , and the taps continued to gush , so she checked on May-Annlouise only to find her sitting at the edge of a tub near overflowing . Adriane shut off the water , looked into a blank face , and decided to undress the older woman , starting cautiously with her shoes , socks , sweater , prompting neither cooperation nor resistance . Eventually Adriane , the larger of the two by far , was able to guide the other 's legs into the tub and slowly push the rest of the body into churning water . " You 'll see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrett to have him come over and take care of this , but did n't want to cause a scene . It was bad enough MayAnnlouise knew Garrett had been here ; there was no point in telling him about his wife 's visit . To do so would destroy whatever sense of refuge Adriane 's apartment held for him . <p> At the kitchen sink she washed the chocolate stain out of MayAnnlouise 's sweater and laid it to dry on a towel on the countertop and tried to distract herself by thinking about the upcoming games . Adriane had bet a hundred dollars each on the Falcons , Lions , Cardinals , and Patriots to beat the spread . If she won , she would let it ride on the Raiders in the late game . In this fashion she 'd managed to rake in nearly three thousand easy dollars in just over a month . <p> Her father would have been proud . He used to watch pro football and made her join him , claiming she was his good-luck charm . Actually , she coveted Sundays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Late in the morning , as her mother washed the breakfast dishes , he would mix a pitcher of Manhattans , pour one into a chilled glass , and take it into the bathroom , where he sat on the toilet lid and sipped it , puffed an imported cigarette , and let his daughter shave him . Using an antique fur brush , she would gently apply a cream that smelled of meadow grass . And then with the utmost care she held the bone-handled straight razor , also an antique , to the edge of his sideburns and would slowly erase the shadows that had grown across his face during the night . Adriane had always found him painfully glamorous . <p> Around noon her father would choose his teams for the day and place a call to one of several bookmakers . Throughout the games he would continue to smoke cigarettes and drink Manhattans and shelter her under his free arm , while on the television sweaty , muscular men flung themselves against one another , grunting and thrusting , rutting through the mud-to Adriane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when the Colts still played in Baltimore , before they skipped town in the middle of the night . It was fun having a home team to root for-though , often as not , her father bet against them . Over time he ran up gambling debts of such magnitude , and crossed his creditors enough , that certain underworld elements took him down . <p> Specifically , they brought him to the Quality Inn on York Road and shot his beautiful face off . Despite the absence of a note , his death was made to look like suicide-a theory Adriane discounted because her father could never abide leaving her . The police were worthless ; there was never any real investigation into his killing , undoubtedly because the people her father had angered were very , very powerful . <p> Her mother believed his death a suicide and chose to punish Adriane through a predominating silence . Even the lone compliment Adriane could savor from those years-a reference to her " alluring " eyes-seemed tainted by accusation and innuendo . Honestly , there was nothing incestuous about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother as much as he loved Adriane-a simple if difficult fact that Adriane could n't change even if she 'd wanted to , which she did n't . <p> Anxious for something to do , Adriane mixed a pitcher of Manhattans . She knocked on the bathroom door and called out and , getting no response , barged in . May-Annlouise soaked quietly ; tears mingled with beads of sweat . Adriane handed her a Manhattan and stuck a finger in the water . <p> " Well , this wo n't do , " she said , adding more hot and a new squirt of bath gel . Adriane sat cross-legged on the floor , feeling rather pleased with herself . Here she was , after all , ministering to her lover 's wife , comforting the woman , helping . " Pretty good , no ? " <p> May-Annlouise nodded drowsily . <p> Adriane watched the new bubbles slowly rise around the older woman 's pale skin . Such beautiful breasts . Certainly more shapely than Adriane 's , which was unfair since May-Annlouise had two children already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May-Annlouise looked up but otherwise did n't move . This is what grief did to you , Adriane decided . She 'd noticed it in Garrett and now in his wife . It crippled you . She felt grateful that the buoying presence of God had cushioned the grief in her own life . <p> " What do you want from me ? " May-Annlouise asked . <p> Adriane continued to hold the breast ; its soft comfort called forth a longing that surprised her . She had never been attracted to women , yet the idea of seducing May-Annlouise emerged with breathtaking urgency . It was n't even seduction , really , more like a desperate need to charm the older woman-to woo her somehow . As gently as possible , Adriane squeezed the breast and murmured , " Beautiful . " <p> A hand appeared from nowhere and slapped her across the face , knocking the cocktail from her hand . She rubbed her cheek in an effort to dry the undignified wetness trickling toward her neck . <p> " You have no shame ! " May-Annlouise was shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spill over the tub 's lip . Stepping around broken glass , she strode past Adriane toward the towel rack and gathered her clothes . " You 're indecent , " she scolded , fumbling with her bra . " You 're - there 's a word : homewrecker . " <p> " My mother liked that word . I find it a bit old-fashioned . " Adriane pushed herself up off the floor and regarded the puddles around herthe aftermath of a squall . Her maraschino cherry lay by the toilet . " You should n't drive , " she mumbled , trying to regain control of the situation . <p> " Do n't tell me what I should n't do . And for the record , " MayAnnlouise said , violently zipping her corduroy slacks , " stop messing around with my husband . " <p> " Nothing 's been consummated , " said Adriane . She was able to muster some belligerence around this factual accuracy and looked the older woman in the eye . <p> " I should hope nott " said May-Annlouise , turning to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'll do whatever I think is best , " Adriane called out , and then felt compelled to add : " You know , some poor kid lost that cat's-eye marble . " <p> But May-Annlouise was already gone , having left the front door contemptuously ajar , and Adriane found herself talking to an empty apartment . <p> She curled up on the sofa and steeled herself to endure the remaining half-hour before kickoff . Pulling an afghan around her chin , she beseeched her Gentle Listener : I hope I am not a slut in Your eyes , but the woman was suffering , and I was helping her-You saw-and then ... and then , I do n't know . I just needed to win her over , You know ? To make her respond to me . Please do n't be mad . Thanks again for that field goal last Monday night , by the way . You did n't have to do that . Adriane suddenly clutched a pillow and wept . You 're way too good to me . <p> The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had that initial Thursday , and helped themselves to tapas . Adriane put only a little on her plate , but Garrett hobbled back to their booth carrying a small mountain of food . " Good news , " he said as he sat down . " There 's some feeling in his fingertips . It may be nothing , his doctor says , but it may be something , too . " <p> A pang of empathy squirmed into her throat as she thought about the boy , not an especially pleasant kid from what she 'd heard , but still , there are some things that should never happen to anybody , and she wanted to feel for him , for his struggle , but what she said instead was : " Did you like your wife in bed , back in the days when she let you touch her ? " <p> He pushed his plate aside and reached for Adriane 's hand across the table . " I wanted to talk to you about her . " He was choosing his words slowly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " some kind of truce between us . We 've been talking , kissing again . " <p> " She 's a good kisser , I hear . She just does n't sound very stable . I mean , you bought a house because she found a marble in it ? I would n't trust a woman like that . " <p> " We had a long fight-about you , among other matters . And it was , um , it was good for us . " He smiled sheepishly . " It cleared the air about a lot of things . " Adriane stared at him . She was a " matter , " one among many . With his free hand he picked up an unlit candle and looked underneath it . " I 'm concerned that I 've been using you . " <p> " You 're using me ? " Adriane coughed out a laugh . " Believe me , I know what it 's like to be used , and this is n't it . " Though that was just a comeback , she wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " but if we were to continue , in light of- " <p> " Did you know the Steelers are going to beat the spread on Sunday ? " <p> " The spread ? " <p> " If you want me to place a bet for you , let me know tomorrow . It 'll be the easiest money you ever made . " <p> He let go of her hand to reach for his wallet , and she stood up suddenly and blurted , " Do n't give me any money-I 'm not a whore ! " Heads turned along the bar . <p> Garrett cringed and whispered , " When do I give you money ? " <p> " I 'll be giving you the money , " she said , eager to dispense with the transaction and get out of there . " So how much are you in for ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said , that boyish look again . " How much are people usually in for ? " <p> " I 'm not asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , gazing down at him . " Minimum bet 's fifty dollars . " <p> He seemed puzzled at the conversation 's turn , and she felt a trill of pleasure over her ability to manipulate him . <p> " How much are you betting ? " he asked . <p> " Oh , you dear man . " She put on her jacket . " You would n't be able to sleep tonight . " <p> On Sunday , the first December snowflakes began their descent , but at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh the sun shone brightly , and it was the weather at the game that lately seemed to Adriane the real weather of her afternoon . That morning , as planned , she had placed her season winnings on the Steelers minus 14 1/2 points . They were twotouchdown favorites , but as of last week Adriane 's bookie had begun making her give up an extra half-point because of her track record . Now , a half-hour before kickoff , she called a second time to throw the rest of her savings into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ( they never used real names on the phone ; she did n't even know his last name ) . " I ca n't take that . " <p> " I do n't believe you . " <p> " Swear on my mother 's grave : I 've got too much weight on the Steelers already . " <p> " You son of a bitch , you can take me . " She was never rude to her bookie , but she was desperate to place this bet . He simply had to bend to her will . " I 'm good for it , " she insisted . " Or , if you prefer , just shoot my face off . " <p> " Christ . You yuppies and your gangster fantasies . It does n't work that way . " <p> " I know how it works , " she said . " Either take my bet or start listening to your phone for clicks . " Adriane was getting way ahead of herself . " You ever have a problem with me , mister , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the phone . " I was just trying to look out for you , " he said finally . " I like you , kid . " <p> " I 'm not aiming for likable anymore , Just take my action . " Satisfied to have prevailed , she hung up . Her hands trembled . She wondered if part of her was trying to provoke violence against herself . Out of some urge to reunite with her father . A crazy idea . Her mother had entertained such thoughts when she 'd checked into the same fateful room at the Quality Inn on York Road and swallowed a bucket of pills . No ambiguity surrounding that death . In her naive cursive , her mother had left a final note , voicing her ambition to " rejoin my husband . " Adriane read it as a gratuitous , parting mind-fuck . Not to mention a sucker 's bet ; everyone knew-you did n't even have to be religious to know-that suicides and the victims of gangland-style executions did not share the same afterlife . <p> She settled in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers continued to shake as she brought the first kernels to her mouth . What realm of the afterlife would she herself one day inhabit ? Adriane made a mental note to read Dante as soon as football season was over . She was hoping that whatever points she would likely lose over the adultery , she 'd more than recapture for her role as sexual healer . It sort of depended on who did the judging ; she was still getting a feel for it . <p> By the time the third quarter began-her team up by seven-she considered the implications of her bet . If she won , she 'd have amassed enough to take a year off and do almost anything she might want . She definitely could n't show her face around city hall anymore . <p> Halfway into the fourth quarter , Adriane heard a knock at her door , and on the other side , to her amazement , stood May-Annlouise . The circles and bags under her eyes had faded , and she showed some teeth this time-an actual smile . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself opening the door a little wider . <p> " I just wanted to stop by and , well , apologize is n't really the right word , " May-Annlouise said , catching her breath . " I mean , I 'm still upset about you and my husband , but I behaved badly when I was here , and I 'm not pleased with myself . " <p> " Oh , " said Adriane . She could not recall the last time anyone apologized to her ; what was she supposed to do ? She wanted to be gracious , but she had a game to get back to . <p> " You like football ? " she asked . " You want some soda ? Hot chocolate ? " <p> " I guess I can stay for some hot chocolate , please . " <p> Adriane read into this a flirtatious nod toward the previous Sunday , possibly even a little regret , and this juiced her spirits . <p> " Too bad you did n't come by earlier . I could have gotten you in on a sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lock . " <p> " Gambling 's not my poison , " said May-Annlouise , passing over the sofa for the piano bench . <p> " It makes it a lot more interesting to watch . " <p> May-Annlouise politely shook her head . " Anyway , I need to relieve Garrett soon at the hospital . There 's a little bit of feeling , Garrett must have told you , in my son 's fingertips . " <p> " Your husband 's in for a hundred . " <p> " Oh , is he ? " said May-Annlouise , cocking her head . " Then I 'm already in for fifty . I can stay for a few minutes . Which ones are the Steelers ? " <p> " Yellow and black . They have the best secondary in the conference this year . " Adriane took a moment here and there to explain the game . May-Annlouise had the basics down in a minute , and when Pittsburgh scored on a deep post , she even let loose a little cheer . <p> Well , Adriane thought proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration . <p> " Things are better between Garrett and me now , " said MayAnnlouise . <p> Adriane held a finger to her lips . " Wait till a commercial . " Pittsburgh continued to dominate . They 'd already covered the spread except for that pesky half-point Adriane had to give . May-Annlouise said she really should be going . <p> Adriane gripped her armrest and scowled . " I 've got a lot riding on this one , " she said , her jaw tight . " You could call this a life-changing game . Ca n't you stay for a half-hour ? " <p> May-Annlouise thought about it and excused herself to call Garrett and tell him she 'd be a little late . <p> " Do n't mention you 're here , " Adriane said over her shoulder . <p> " Of course I will . We may have our problems , but dishonesty is n't one of them . " <p> " Yeah , " Adriane muttered , " you guys are a regular Ozzie and Harriet . " <p> In the kitchen there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not specify where she was calling from . Adriane took this as a small victory and flashed her most winning smile when May-Annlouise returned . <p> " Things are better between Garrett and me , " the older woman began again , in the middle of a Pittsburgh screen pass . " I was so out of my head for a time there . I 'm still crying every day , but at least I see him again , I can let him help me . We help each other- " <p> " Sure , " said Adriane , boosting the TV volume . <p> " You know , " continued May-Annlouise , " I 'm still sorting out how I feel about his infidelity . Maybe it will upset me more later . But right now it seems like you 've done us a favor , in an unusual way . Maybe even helped our marriage . We were just talking about that the other night . " <p> " You mean I 've , like , pollinated you two ? " Adriane glared at her . <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Alerted us that something valuable needs rescuing- " <p> " Look ! " shouted Adriane . " Do n't put this on mel If you two are pathetic enough to stay together , do I deserve the blame for that ? Do I have that kind of power ? You do n't even love him , " she found herself adding . " You do n't know how to love . " <p> " Adriane , do n't be absurd . " May-Annlouise laughed breezily , but the tilt of her head expressed a pained curiosity . " Have you been telling him that ? " <p> Adriane ignored her . On the TV , Pittsburgh leisurely pushed forward . With less than two minutes remaining , the Steelers were content to grind down the clock with running plays straight up the middle . Come on , score . Do n't hang me out to dry here . Do something . <p> And then , as though her Gentle Listener had stepped in , a neat hole opened in the Cleveland line and the Pittsburgh running backsome cocksure rookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the endzone . Two defenders converged and , just as he crossed the goal line and won Adriane 's bet for her ( all that money ! all that freedom ! hers ! ) , dove at him from opposite sides and collided against his rib cage . A splintering crunch came from the TV , the sound of a beaded curtain parting . <p> Adriane let her breath out , had trouble taking in another . Was that really necessary ? she thought , as the kid lay motionless . <p> The fans , what few remained , cheered tepidly for the extra score . And there was restrained celebration on the Pittsburgh bench as players craned to see what was going on with the injured kid-not a popular teammate , but there are some things that should never happen to anybody . Adriane muted the TV , dropped the remote . <p> I cursed him , she thought ; the idea seemed as preposterous as it did certain . She uttered the word out loud : " cursed . " " What 's the matter ? " May-Annlouise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just score ? " <p> The team doctor jogged onto the field-poised , conscientious , responsible . What if I 'm responsible ? fretted Adriane , herself motionless on the couch . <p> May-Annlouise sat next to her and touched her shoulder-fussed over her with maternal hands . <p> Get him up , wo n't You ? Adriane thought . Hello ? <p> " Dear ? " May-Annlouise asked , alarm creeping into her voice , " how much did you lose ? " <p> The weight of grief pressed Adriane against her sofa , and she continued to hear , behind the silence , the parting of a beaded curtain , the one separating life from death . <p> She peered across to the other side . In that distant realm , her mother and father-together after all-embraced , gently yet passionately . Making tenderest love . Just as Adriane might have wished for them , if only she were a better human being . <p>
