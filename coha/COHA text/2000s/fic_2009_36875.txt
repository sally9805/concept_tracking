Ellie Jane <br> She took the job at the railroad ticket office quite by accident when her father , Sheriff Floyd Voyant , was summoned to the station to arrest the ticket agent who had shown up drunk to work one morning . <br> It was early June , just after graduation , and Ellie Jane  --  needing to stop by the post office anyway  --  had accompanied her father . At the insistence of Mr. Coleman , the station manager , she settled behind the desk to fill in for the afternoon . <br> She had been seventeen years old . She never left . <br> Some people , she supposed , might find it monotonous to sit in a little glass booth , day after day , but not Ellie Jane . These were her finest hours , chatting with her fellow townspeople . She might ask , " Oh , do you have family in Tennessee ? " or " Did n't you just travel to Boston last month ? " And the person on the other side of the glass would be forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terse comments . <br> If she were to run into any of these same people in the town square , while running errands in the Picksville shops , they might walk right past her or make a quick detour into the butcher 's shop . But here , if they wanted her to slide that ticket through the little archway cut into the glass , they 'd have to engage in a bit of conversation . <br> This afternoon , the first Tuesday in May , Ellie Jane was finishing her modest lunch of an apple , cinnamon butter bread , and tea , when a tentative knock at the glass window got her attention . It was Morris Bennett , a little early to take advantage of passengers needing help with their bags . <br> " Miss Ellie Jane ? " His voice was soft and muffled . " I gots a telegraph message for you . " He slid a slip of paper through the arched opening at the bottom of the glass . <br> " Why thank you , Morris . " Ellie Jane sent him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was carefully controlled  --  an attempt to hide the excitement of such an occasion . Other people might receive telegrams every day from friends and family who lived in places they took the train to visit . But Ellie Jane 's whole life was here  --  equally divided between her little glass booth and the home she shared with her father . There was , of course , her brother , Dave , in Chicago , but his was a busy , exciting life that left little time for frivolous messages home . <br> She fished around inside her little cloth handbag to slip the boy a dime , which he took with a wide toothy grin and dropped immediately into his pocket . <br> " Anything else today , m'am ? " <br> Ellie Jane checked the watch pinned to her blouse . <br> " The two-o'clock will be here soon , Morris . Perhaps you 'd like to stay and see if any passengers need help with their bags ? " <br> " Yes , m'am . " He touched the rim of his cap and sauntered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Despite her curiosity , before opening the telegram , Ellie Jane carefully put away the remains of her lunch in her bucket , wiped the corners of her mouth with a pretty floral napkin , and removed the square sign telling any potential ticket buyer that the window was closed for lunchtime . <br> Then , with nervous fingers , she opened the envelope and saw that the message was indeed from her brother . Her reaction differed each time she read the short note : first a giggle , then confusion , then a rather cold fear . <br> David was sending her a man . And he was coming on the twoo'clock train . <br> Continues ...
