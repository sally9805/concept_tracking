ELODIE KICKED HER HEELS restlessly against her wheelchair footrests . At last he had come . The bare whiff of bitter smoke told her that John , her Friendly Visitor , had lit his usual pre-visit cigarette on the Mary-Le-Bow Center patio . <p> How Mel loved the smoke . It reminded her of the bonfire her younger brothers had set on a long-ago , lazy autumn afternoon while she watched from the caned rocker on Mum 's porch . Before she had lost her sight . <p> The leaves , brown and yellow and orange , had fired up with a crackle as the boys laughed madly , the smoke billowing skyward , nearly the same color as the icy gray Midlands clouds . <p> John 's cigarettes , like the burning leaves . He had told her the name of his brand . An elegant name , vaguely exciting . Mel would n't forget it , because it was like his name : John . Her voiceboard was ready . She hit the up arrow just as she heard his feet padding into the dayroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Aw , Mel , you caught me at it again . " <p> Mel laughed , honking like a lost gosling . Something was wet on her chin . Drool , she supposed . John 's hand touched her chest , then something soft and antiseptic-smelling wiped her face . Her bib . <p> The damn nurses had bibbed her , and she 'd told them no bib , please , because John was coming . Today was her Friendly Visit . Furious at the nurses , betrayal , she kicked at the floor with her feet , rolling her chair back a few inches . John followed . <p> " You 'll get me to quit , " John said . " Just keep at me . " <p> " You're.too handsome to die young , " Mel pressed into the voiceboard . <p> " Did your Mum call ? " John asked . <p> Mel shook her head . More drool on her chin . " Do n't wipe me , " she said through the droning voiceboard . No intonation , no fury , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because that was how it made words , from vowels and sounds put together , depending upon how she rolled the smooth plastic ball controller and which of the four arrows she pressed . <p> " You 're twenty-three , you do n't need your Mum 's permission . " <p> " Twenty-four , " Mel corrected . " I know , " she added , about the permission . <p> " This is the chance of a lifetime , Mel . I thought you would have done it by now . " <p> Mel nodded . John was right . She should be getting her implants by now . It was n't every spastic , blind twenty-four-year-old cripple who won the lottery to explore the stars . Her number , chosen for the chance to be a probe controller for the ISA , sent light-years away to Tau Ceti or Sirius or wherever they needed to send her . <p> " I thought today might be our last visit , so I brought you this . It 's nothing much . " John took her better hand , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicate chain and small hard cubes that she rubbed between her fingers . A bracelet , with beads or stones , deliciously warm from being in John 's pocket . <p> " For me ? " Mel had n't expected a gift . Especially not anything so personal , like a bracelet . Again , the wetness on her chin . Disgusting spit ! Damn rebellious mouth ! She heard herself making noises , but she could n't reach for the voiceboard just then , because John was fastening the bracelet around her wrist . <p> " It 's a W-W-J-D bracelet , " he said . The cube-shaped beads had cooled because Mel had n't any circulation in her hands . Cold hands , warm heart , her Mum had always said . The bracelet was loose . Mel was afraid that it would slip off as she jerked her arms around like a puppet , the way she did sometimes . <p> " Wuh , wuh , wuh , " Mel said , with her mouth . <p> " What does it meant Oh , sure - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , " Mel said through the voiceboard . Why had she thought it might be a real bracelet - that the beads might be pearls ? Like boyfriends and girlfriends gave each other . She did n't believe at all in Jesus . How could she , after the way she 'd turned out ? No God she would ever believe in could let people turn out the way she had . <p> " I love it , " she said , glad that the voiceboard was so easy to use for lies . John steadied her wrist . Mel realized she 'd been flailing again . " After you go , we probably wo n't see each other again . I mean , by the time you get back - " He paused . <p> " You 'll be very old , " Mel said . <p> " I 'll probably be dead , " John said , laughing . <p> Mel changed the subject . " How 's your song doing ? " <p> John did n't say anything for a moment . " Oh , crackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that good or bad ? " <p> " Good , " John said . " We 're doing the next one right now . " " Viddy , too ? " <p> " Viddy too . And the first thousand are special release . The kiddies get Star Bars with every copy and the first fifty get a T-Shirt . " <p> " Trts Fab , " Mel said . " I wish could see it . " She 'd heard John 's music , but wanted so desperately to see the videos . John was a viddy star musician . Played guitar and sitar . Hana , the morning nurse , had told Mel that John was " a God .. so totally fab.11 <p> " Look , Mel , " John said . " Do n't worry about your Mum . Or your brothers . just go . If I had the chance , I 'd take it in a heartbeat . " <p> Mel shook her head . " I know . You 're right , " she said . They would n't wait forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . There had to be lots of .. cripples . Waiting for the chance . Sitting in their chairs and drooling , waiting for their number to come up , for ISA to pick them and make them something like whole again . No . That was n't it . Not whole , but something .. different . Turn the whole stinking , spastic body off . Adapt the brain which was functioning , discard the body that was n't , and shoot it off to the stars . Live forever and go where no man could ever go . Not a whole one , anyway . Small things like brains could go in hardened housings . Big things like bodies could n't . Or should n't . <p> " Mel , why on earth are you waiting ? " John asked . <p> Because of you , John , Mel thought . <p> " I know it does n't hurt , " John said . " I saw a vid all about it . It 's like magic , how they put you in the probe . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested near her leg . His warm fingers stroked her cold palm . " I 'm afraid , " she told him , even though that was n't true . She could n't possibly say the truth . <p> " That 's natural , " he said . <p> Her head began to roll around , then her chin fell on the damp bib . <p> " I asked them if I would be able to see again , " she continued . " They have n't answered me . " <p> " I 'm sure you 'll be able , " John said , squeezing her hand . " You 'll have better senses than any normal person . " <p> " I guess that 's better than having the senses of an abnormal person , " Met said . <p> John laughed loudly . Mel sensed that his laughter was forced . " That 's what I love about you , " he said . " You 've got a smashing sense of humor . " <p> Did n't all cripples ! <p> " Take me for a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in her lap . " You can smoke there . I do n't mind . " John was a very good Friendly Visitor . He put his hand on her shoulder and guided her gently as they went . <p> Mum brought sandwiches packed in a wicker basket . Mel smelled the sandwiches - pressed liver and spirulina paste , she thought - and also smelled the basket , hearing the crackle as Mum opened it . She 'd taken Mel out across the wide field , where the pollen made Mel sneeze , stopping when they reached the small hillock in the middle . The sun burned the part on the top of Mel 's head . She asked for a napkin . Sighing , Mum covered Mel 's hair and laid out the food . <p> " Can you chew today , dear ? " Mum asked . <p> Mel nodded . She seldom used the voiceboard with Mum . Mum preferred it that way ; she liked Mel to use the baby talk and the grunting which had been all Mel could manage for most of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel asked . <p> " Oh , fine . Jack 's got a new girlfriend . Peter 's still into his electric trains . " Mum fed Mel a piece of the sandwich . She had been right : it was liver sausage and stale-tasting spirulina paste . <p> " How about Davey ? " <p> " Oh , the same , " Mum said . This meant that Davey had n't quit using . Davey was two years younger than Mel . He was tall and athletic , but he 'd started in with drugs at the age of twelve and had never held a job for longer than two weeks . Davey was Mum 's favorite . <p> Mum sat by Mel 's chair , spreading out her skirt with a rustle of fabric . " Listen , " she said . " About your e-mail . " <p> Mel deliberately pushed some chewed sandwich paste out of her mouth and made a choking noise . Mum got up , knees crackling , to wipe Mel 's face . <p> " Dear , I do n't think you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never ... " <p> " Never what ? " Mel said through her voiceboard . <p> Mum roughly wiped the sandwich paste away , then stuffed another piece in Mel 's mouth . " You know what I mean . " <p> " You mean that will be it once they do the implants and get rid of my body . " <p> " Yes . Do n't be smart . " <p> " What does it matter , Mum ? What good is my body now ? " <p> " Dear , we 've been over it . Do n't you think if they can send a ship to another star , they might not find a cure for you ? What if you do this , and the next day they come up with an operation which would make you ... " <p> " Normal ? " Mel said . " They can give me a prosthesis body now , Mum . But where would the money come from ? " <p> Mum was weeping . " Christ on His cross , Mel , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone 's face ? " <p> Mel said nothing . She thought of John , the way he smelled . She wanted to see his face , all fab , the way the nurse Hana described him . She imagined herself normal , wearing a white seersucker dress , running across the field with John , laughing . John 's hair was long - she had touched it . Hana had told Mel it was dark brown and shone in the light . Soft , and a little bit curly . Mel 's hair was thin and patchy , a muddy dark blond . It had gotten worse since she 'd gone blind . Before , she had been able to comb it on her best days ; put ribbons and bows in it . Now , it was chopped off just below her ears so it would n't fall in her face or get nasty with bits of food or drool . Practical , the way things needed to be at the Mary-Le-Bow Center . <p> " I 'm going to do it , " Mel said through the voiceboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> " Do n't argue , Mum . " Mel remembered what John had said , about her being old enough . She wished she could have said it with his style , his carefree flair . <p> Mum 's arms were around her . Mel 's face was pressed uncomfortably between Mum 's breast and her bony shoulder . " I 'll never see you again , luv . Not if they send you off on that ship . " <p> Straining to move her arm , Mel got one hand on the voiceboard . " You never come unless there 's something wrong anyway , " she said , knowing what it would do to Mum . <p> " Oh , Mel , " Mum sobbed . " How can you hurt me so ? " <p> " John says I should go for it , " Mel said . The voiceboard droned on . " I think I will , " she said , although she did not mean it . Going would mean leaving John . <p> THE ISA COUNSELING specialist was an American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans had pioneered the technology for the space probes . No normal bodies could survive the trip to other stars , with the hard radiation and all the other myriad challenges . So , the essential part of people - their brains - had been placed in hardened housings and intimately connected to the probe itself . It was one way to do it . Not the only way - just a way - to explore and discover ahead of the complex and costly generation ships which would follow . <p> Because of the danger involved , condemned criminals were to have been the initial probe controllers . But that had n't gone over . Why not give people a chance who deserved it ? That was the public outcry , about the time Mel had gone blind . The ISA had decided that people like Mel should be selected , not criminals . <p> If you were a registered applicant and your number came up in the lottery , you had thirty days to decide . If you declined , your chance went to someone else : another waiting cripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be married , and could n't have any children . If you were under legal age , your guardian had to give permission . Mel knew all this , but it was repeated for her during her orientation . She did n't know why she was surprised when the ISA people came to the Mary-Le-Bow Center . She supposed it was easier to bring the equipment and the specialists to the cripple , rather than transferring her . <p> The ISA counseling specialist , who had a western twang which Mel thought was very cowboy-like , told her how the implants worked . <p> " We put them into your cerebral cortex , " he said . " Bio-electrical devices . We also implant controls into the main nerve centers which control body function - cerebellum and pons and so on . The probe will become your body . " <p> " I 've never had very good control , " Mel said . <p> He chuckled . " This will be different , " he said . " After we start the process , you 'll have two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can stop it at any point up until the time we - " <p> " Get rid of my body , " Mel said . <p> " Yeah , " the counselor said . " You got it . " <p> " Can you tell me something ? " Mel asked . <p> " Anything . I 'm here to answer all of your questions . " <p> " Before you put me in the ... " <p> " Housing , " he said . <p> " I want to know if I 'll be able to see again . Is that part before or after ? " " Oh , " he said , drawing in his breath , as if she 'd surprised him . " You could see some things , I think . You 'll have your visual cortex connected and I suppose we could fix something up . I had n't thought about it quite that way before . Not everyone we work with is blind . " <p> " Before the final step - will I be able to move ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you mean more than you can right now ? I 'm afraid not . We 'll have to shut many functions down . You may not be able to move at all . " <p> " My voiceboard ? " <p> There was a pause . " Possibly . I ca n't tell until we evaluate you further . With your degree of motor impairment , it 's difficult to know . There may be seizures . We are working with your brain , you know . " <p> " If I ca n't use my voiceboard , how will I tell you to stop ? " <p> The counselor touched her hand . He tapped the middle of her palm with one finger . <p> " Twice a day until the final step , I 'll tap your hand once . You move your fingers , if you want to go ahead . If I do n't feel anything , I 'll tap twice . Like this . " She felt him tap two times . " If you move then , we 'll stop . Remove the implants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Is that it for today ? " <p> The counselor patted her shoulder , impersonally . " If you 're tired , " he said . <p> " No , " Mel said . " I 'm not tired . But today is my Friendly Visitor day . I 'm expecting someone . " <p> " Oh , " the counselor said . " Well , that 's good . Who is she ? " <p> " Him , " Mel said . " His name is John . He 's a musician . " <p> " Very good , " said the counselor . Then , he left . <p> Mel waited in the dayroom for an hour . No one came . Finally , she wheeled to the door and pressed the call button . She guessed it had been about ten minutes when a nurse finally showed up . It was Hana . <p> " Yes , luv ? " <p> " Hana , I was waiting for John . " <p> " Oh , he 's not here ? " <p> Mel had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you see him ? " <p> " No , luv . I suppose he 's not coming today . Let 's give you a nice bath . You 'll want to be all fresh for those nice ISA gentlemen . How lucky you are ! " <p> " I suppose so , " Mel said , hoping that John would come later . It was so unlike him not to come , and not to call . He always called , and he was hardly ever late . After the bath , during which Hana had scrubbed too hard , Met thought , though she could n't say anything without the voiceboard , Mel sat by the window in her room , feeling the warm light on her cheeks . Why had n't John come ? Or called ? No one knew anything , and it was too tiring to keep asking . She fell asleep in her chair . When she woke , it cold . She was still by the window , and they were fastening a dinner tray on her chair and tying a bib around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nurse , who was washing something , Mel thought perhaps her water jug , in the sink . <p> " Yes ? " Hana began to hum a little tune , something Indian-sounding . Maybe that was what John 's music sounded like . Mel had always wanted to hear it , but John always forgot to bring his recordings . He was so busy . <p> " Before I go any farther with this , I want to do something " Mel paused , waiting for Hana 's reaction . There was none . " I want to smoke a cigarette . Like John 's , " she continued . <p> " Oh , luv ! The way you breathe ? You 'll keel over ! It 's nasty , nasty . Why would you want to do that ? " <p> Mel kept working at the voiceboard . " I want to smoke a John Player Special . I want to eat lobster . I want to feel what it 's like to have somebody ... 11 Mel meant John , but she was n't about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I want to feel a kiss . " <p> Hana turned off the water . Mel felt her sit on the bed , smelled her cologne . Hana 's hand , damp from the water , brushed Mel 's forehead . <p> " I think I understand . " Hana 's warm lips touched Mel 's cheek . She took Mel 's hand , and rubbed Mel 's wrist in a soothing way . <p> Mel tried to speak with her mouth . " I wuh-wuh-hunt s-s-s-s ... " <p> " You want a bit of life , " Hana said . She raised Mel and held her close . " I 'm no man , not like what you mean , but I love you , Mel-o-die . " Hana almost sang Mel 's name . Tears stung in the corners of Mel 's eyes . <p> " I see what I can do about that lobster , " Hana said . " My boyfriend 's a chef . Have I ever said ? He 'd be proud to make something up for you . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very good . You 'll like it . But first , we 'll get you dressed , for those ISA doctors . " <p> Later that day , the ISA technicians finished implanting her visual bioelectrodes . The counselor told her that they 'd made something up for her : a special visor similar to one which had been developed for cold-fusion technicians , the ones who worked with the magnetic bottles which contained the reaction . A visor sensitive in the ultra-violet and infra-red , as well as the normal visual spectrum . Whatever she would see through it would n't be like what she had seen before she 'd gone blind . <p> Mel 's old doctor had said , brutally , Mel remembered , that she 'd really gotten the short end of the genetic stick . Cerebral palsy - a spastic - with a heart defect , and retinitis pigmentosa . It did n't get much worse than that , he 'd said . <p> The ISA counselor arrived , just as the technicians were fitting the visor . He spoke to her , holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes . " I know it hurts . Just stay with us . It 's going straight into your optic nerve , which ai n't damaged . You ought a see something , but we ca n't guarantee technicolor . " <p> Mel had shut her eyes . They 'd said it did n't matter whether they were open or shut . It was going over the eyes , not into them . The implant went through her temples . The connection was so fine , he 'd said , that no one could see it , and she was n't supposed to feel it . Even so , Mel felt like they were breaking holes in her skull with a jackhammer . <p> " You ca n't move , " the counselor explained . " It wo n't work until you 've adjusted thoroughly and the implants have integrated . " <p> Mel realized that they were drilling holes in her skull , not for the implant , but to stabilize the visor . She could n't say anything . They 'd taken her voiceboard away , promising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice , moaning . Hers . Something dribbled on her chin . They whacked the crown of her head , again and again . <p> The counselor squeezed her hand . His finger tapped , once . She squeezed back . " That 's great , " he said . " Now , they 'll activate it . " <p> Mel closed her eyes . It was as if she had opened them , but she had n't . A long , mournful-looking face appeared , grainy and hazy , like an antique telly when it was turned on . Big nose , and a wild head of bushy hair . The face smiled , crookedly , showing a mouth full of even , pale teeth . He must be the counselor , Mel thought . Her head was throbbing viciously , but she managed to smile in return . Somebody thrust the voiceboard in her lap . <p> " I see you , " she said . " You 've got a big nose . " <p> " That 's right , darlin ' . " The head turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hazy and wavering , but unmistakably concerned . " Hey , she 's got me ! " the counselor called to them . <p> " I have n't seen anyone in six years , " Mel said . <p> " And my good-looking mug is the first ! I 'm touched , " the counselor replied . The technicians were grinning . They were both young close to Mel 's age . One blond-seeming , though colors just did n't look the way she remembered , and the other darker , with a thin , nervous face . Another face appeared . Dark , pretty , soft and round , with large eyes and full lips . <p> " Hana , " Mel said . <p> " Ah , that 's right ! You can see ! " Hana wheeled a cart toward Mel . The technicians grinned , parting to allow Hana to approach , while the counselor stepped back , crossing his arms . Hana lifted the cover of a metal dish with a flourish . <p> Mel remembered what lobsters looked like . This lobster was huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost expected him to lift his claws and start snapping at her . He was bright red , she thought , but somehow the color did n't look right . Too vivid , perhaps , as if he was glowing . He glowed with heat , she realized . She saw it , rising in waves from his shell . <p> Hana removed a claw and cracked it . She worked a piece of hot white flesh from the claw , dipped it in a small dish , and brought it to Mel 's lips . <p> " Here 's your taste of lobster , " she said . <p> Mel took the soft flesh in her mouth and began to chew . It was silken and buttery , yielding to her tongue and her teeth . Beyond delicious . She closed her eyes , but the visor still worked - she could still see . They were smiling at her , Hana looking proud , the technicians nodding . The counselor took a handkerchief from his pocket , and blew his nose , trumpeting loudly . <p> Mel swallowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> " Yes , you can , " the blond technician said . " Tap your temple , on the left side . " <p> Mel flailed around a bit , then managed to slap the side of her head with her thumb . Everything went dark . <p> Her heart leapt with sudden fear . Had she broken it ? " Now I ca n't see . " <p> " Do it again . Right side . " This time , Mel struggled with her bad right arm , and struck a glancing blow against her cheek . Nothing happened . She gritted her teeth , and tried again . This time , she hit her temple . Everyone reappeared , including the lobster . <p> " It works , " Mel told them . <p> The blond technician slapped his darker partner on the back . " I told youl " <p> " So , " the counselor said , leaning forward , causing his face to expand like a strange balloon . " What would you like to dol We have a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Something at the Globe ? Or a museum ? Would you like to see some paintings ? Sculptures ? " <p> Mel shook her head . " No , I 'm okay . Maybe a book . I would like to read , like I used to . " Before the RP had gotten so bad , Mel had devoured every book she could get her hands on . Listening to books was n't the same . It was nice , but not as satisfying . She thought of John . Sometimes he had read to her . Shakespeare ; the poems of Elizabeth Barrett Browning . One time , from Alice in Wonderland . She wanted to see John , but she was reluctant to say so , especially with the technicians there . <p> The counselor shook his head . " I did n't think you 'd be so easy to please , " he said . <p> " I already told Hana what I wanted , " Mel said . <p> Hana stroked Mel 's forehead . " Yes , and you 've gotten your lobster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . " <p> The blond technician whistled under his breath . " A fortune , " the other one said . <p> Hana began to feed Mel . Mel gorged , smiling with pleasure . She rested her hand on her stomach as the others began to eat the rest of the lobster , grinning and laughing . She could n't possibly finish all of it . She was warmly happy , the ache in her head fading , as the others ate . <p> Mel felt sleepy , and she told Hana that she wanted to take a nap . She thanked the technicians , and the counselor , who shook her hand with a crushing grip , again reminding her of a cowboy . He needed a cowboy hat to complete the picture , but otherwise , she thought that he was perfect . She reminded herself to ask him the next day whether or not he was from Oklahoma , or Arizona , or one of those other cowboy places in the States . <p> Hana pushed Mel from the dayroom into the long corridor , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could see it . It was lined with dull prints of horses and huntsmen . She wheeled Mel into her room . How small the room was . The bed was narrow , with four plump blue pillows at the head , topped with Mel 's teddy bear . There were a few pictures tacked on a cork board to the right of the bed . The boys , Mel realized  --  how tall they had grown . A sink , where Hana and the other nurses washed things . A narrow window looked out on the roadway , where she saw rows of blockhouses across the street . Mel had often heard children playing in the morning . Now she knew where they lived . <p> She saw a daisy in a small vase on a table by the window . Spit tray beside it . A small closet was open on the opposite side of the room . Mel saw a row of open gowns hanging inside the closet , all the same , striped blue and white . Fuzzy slippers rested below the hanging hems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had teddy bear heads on them . Mum had brought them for her birthday - Mel had instinctively disliked them and thought that the odd shapes she had felt on their toes represented defective workmanship , since Mum was always looking for a bargain . Mel looked down at her feet for the first time since she 'd been able to see . She wore pale pink socks . Her feet were turned toward each other , and curled into themselves , like pictures she 'd seen of Chinese women with their feet bound . They 'd turned that way since she 'd been blind . Above the doubled-over pink socks , her legs were the width of a broom handle , and dead , waxy white . <p> There was a mirror above the sink . A polished mirror , not glass , but steel . <p> Mel flailed about with her left arm . She could n't reach her head . <p> " You take your nap now , " Hana said . She left Mel in the middle of the room and went to the bed , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she moved a foot or two closer , she would be able to look into it . <p> " I 'm sleepy , " she said . <p> Hana took the voiceboard from her lap and put it on the table by the vase with the daisy . Hana turned back , and something in her expression told Mel that she had sensed what Mel was thinking . <p> " There 's time for that later , " Hana said . <p> Mel pushed the button on her chair which moved it forward , toward the mirror . Even though she did n't want to look , somehow she had to look . She gazed down at her stick legs a moment , then up to see her face in the mirror . Every bit of joy she had felt earlier , to see , and to taste , bled out of her . The visor was the least of it , like a big pair of blind metal sunglasses over her face . Bolted over the strange , barely-human landscape which had been her face . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw the wetness on her pocked chin before she felt it . Hana retrieved the voiceboard and put it gently on Mel 's lap . <p> " It 's Friendly Visitor day tomorrow , " Mel said . " If John comes , tell him I have been taken for more implants , " she told Hans . " Tell him I 'm not coming back . " <p> " Oh , luv , " Hana said . <p> " Leave me , " Mel replied . Then , after a few seconds , she added , " please . " She looked at her wrist and noticed the bracelet . How could John have visited her ? Spoken to her ? Touched her ? On the bracelet were four tiny square beads set among smaller seed beads , like colored pearls . W-WJ-D , she read on the squares . <p> Goodbye , John . Her lips trembled . She heard herself making noises . Goodbye . She flailed around until she struck her left temple with a strong whack , and everything went black . Tomorrow , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to stop everything . Part of her wanted to go into the ship , if only to get rid of her horrible face . Another part of her said that the stars would hate her . Recoil from her , and she would wander , cold and alone forever . Somehow , that seemed appealing , but no . She would stay in her place in her wheelchair . That was all she deserved . All that was needed . <p> She would tell Hana ... no . She would call herself . In the morning . She could see to go to the phone now . She would make sure that John knew he was no longer needed . <p> What would Jesus do ! Jesus would weep . <p> " I wo n't go , " Mel told Hana , when she came to take her to the dayroom . " I 'm staying in bed . " Mel knew that it was coming out as garbled moans - spastic talk - but Hana seemed to understand . <p> " I give up , " Hana said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Mel should have called , tried to stop John . She had just been so tired . She buried herself in the covers , kicking as well as she could until it felt as though she was covered completely . Like a cave . She got part of the sheet hooked around her hand and dragged it over her head , then turned on her side , away from Hana . <p> " Today 's your visitor day , " Hana said , trying to wheedle a response from Mel . " And those ISA men will be coming soon , too . " <p> Mel pressed her lips together , forcing herself to think about Mum , and her brothers . She tried to go back to sleep , but fell only into a drowsy half  --  sleep , vaguely aware of Hana moving about , cleaning things , pottering in Mel 's closet . <p> Mel shivered , as someone touched her arm . " You 're still wearing my bracelet . " It was John . <p> She jerked her arm , trying to pull it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry to have missed our day . " John patted her shoulder through the sheets . <p> Mel heard herself mumbling . She was n't quite sure of what she wanted to say . No matter what , he would n't understand . God , let him not see her face . <p> " Mel , please sit up . I 've got something to tell you . " The bed sank down . He was sitting beside her . <p> She ground her face into the pillow . " Nuh-no , " she said . She tried to call for Hana , then realized that she had n't heard her soft movements , or her humming , for some time . The traitor had let John in , then left them alone . <p> John was pulling on the covers . Mel struggled , using her hands as weights , but it was hopeless . The sheets slipped away . She flailed toward her head , trying to cover what she could of her face . Her rebellious hand struck the right side of her head . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's this thing they 've put on for your eyes , I do n't care . It looks like sunglasses , is all . Big sunglasses . " <p> " No ! " Mel said . Desperation made her voice strong . <p> John grasped her shoulders . He turned her around as if she was a doll . <p> " Mel , I do n't care . I 've been visiting you for a year . " <p> Her face . He was seeing her horrid face , and she could n't cover it . She caught a glimpse of him through her clenched fists . She tried to strike her left temple , turn off the visor , but her arm was completely rebellious . He had her hands , both of them . He drew them away from her face . <p> A groan escaped her lips as she struggled . John , so fab . His features were fine , almost feminine . His hair was as soft and shiny as the hair of a dark , lovely woman . He had a small beard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held herself as still as she could , though every muscle in her body was going wild . Her feet twitched beneath the covers , out of control . <p> John took her wrist , turning the bracelet . " That visor is nothing , " he said , smiling . " I 'm glad you 're wearing the bracelet . " Something shone on John 's left hand . A ring- he 'd never said he was married . Of course he was married . His wife was probably as stunning as he was . <p> " Muh-muh-muh , " Mel said . She jerked her body toward the table and the voiceboard . John looked uncertain . She moved her shoulders toward the table , and his eyes followed . <p> " Your voiceboard . Right , " he said . He retrieved it . While he walked across the room , Mel thought of covering herself again , but it was too late . He 'd already seen her . And he 'd been seeing her , for the past year . She had been a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had come to visit her , but it certainly could n't have been for any of the reasons she 'd imagined for so long , in her self-deluded blindness . <p> When he put the voiceboard in her lap , she said , " It 's so kind of you to visit the ugly cripple . " <p> John looked puzzled , as he sat by her once more , then sympathy came over his face . No , Mel thought . Pity . She thought of hitting the visor again , going blind , but he was fab , as Hana said . The most gorgeous man she 'd ever seen , she thought - and she had loved to collect pictures of the teen idols , before her eyes had gone . That had been stupid then , just the way this was stupid now . But she loved to look at his face , even as he looked on her with pity , as if she was some trapped laboratory monkey , or a freak from the vids . <p> " Come on , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " let 's take a spin on the patio . I 'll get you into your seat . " Then , he retrieved her wheelchair from the corner ( it was very worn and cracked on the seat , Mel noticed , shabby-looking ) , and brought it to the side of the bed . Mel allowed him to lift her into it . Shamed that she enjoyed his touch , Mel looked away from him , toward the window , and the vase with the daisy . The daisy drooped- that was the end for it . Mel wondered how long it had been there , and who had put it there . Probably Hana . <p> John guided her down the hall , though she no longer needed his help . Mel saw some of the other inmates of the Center peeking out of their doors . They looked jealously at them . Quite a few were elderly . More than Mel had thought . She had n't known how many there were during her blindness . She had n't realized , although she could smell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death and decay and disinfectant . <p> When they reached the patio , John parked her in a sunny spot . A small bird , a linnet , Mel thought , flew past them , wings whirring . He pulled a packet of cigarettes from his shirt pocket , and a lighter . <p> " Come on , " he said , shaking two cigarettes out . " Hana told me that you wanted to do this . " He lit the cigarettes . Their tips glowed-her visor showed a round ball of whitish heat around the tips . John put the filter of one cigarette to her lips . <p> The filter was hot . The smoke burned her nostrils . She put her lips around the filter and drew in a breath . Choking , horrible . Her arms flailed . Could n't use the voiceboard ... could n't speak .. coughing , spitting . <p> John threw both cigarettes down , crushing them beneath his foot , then whacked Mel 's back . " Oh , no , " he said in an agonized voice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel 's eyes were watering , and she was gasping for breath between coughs . What a horrible , vile taste , like swallowing burning coals ! Her throat began to swell . <p> At last , she began to breathe more easily , and the coughing slowed to little hacks wracking her chest every few seconds . <p> " That 's the worst thing I 've ever tasted , " she told him . <p> John knelt beside her , patting her knee . He nodded , his eyes full of regret . " Oh , God , I was so stupid , " he said . <p> " No , " Mel said . " I asked for it . But I like lobster better . " <p> " Hana told me what else you asked for , " he said . Before Mel could react , he 'd leaned forward and had his arms around her . His lips brushed her neck . His voice , so warm and soft , whispering , right next to her ear . Mel felt her body trembling , legs jerking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hopeless . Her chest grew hot ; she felt the flush all the way up her neck , working its way over her cheeks . " Sweet Mel , " he said . <p> She managed to get her hands on the voiceboard , even with John 's body pressed against her lap . <p> " No , " she said . " Please , John . " How warm he was , how hard the muscles felt in his arms and shoulders . He smelled of John Player Specials and of some spicy cologne , and of his own clean , soft flesh . <p> He kissed her neck , gently . She glimpsed his face , eyes closed , moving in front of her , and though she closed her eyes beneath the visor , she still saw the patio , the canvas awning , the little bird flying over the cheap plastic furniture , as his firm , sweet lips touched hers . Not her mouth ! She had seen the terrible teeth in the mirror ; the misshapen lips , cracked and rough . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooling , had to depend on others even to clean her teeth ? It must be horrible for him to come so near . How could he ? <p> " Why ? " she asked . <p> His lips pressed tighter against hers , and his arms drew her close to his body , almost all the way out of the chair . Mel was afraid that she would explode with everything that was rushing through her ; things she did n't even have words for . The patio wavered , her sight flickered , and she heard her heels rattling in the chair . <p> At last , he drew gently away , putting her back in the seat , and sat back on his heels . He was smiling , almost shyly . <p> " Hana said you wanted a kiss , " he said . His voice was throaty and rough - a street-tough tone she 'd never heard from him before . <p> Her hands fluttered over the voiceboard . At last , she made it say , " I was just saying that . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , putting his hand on her knee and looking into the visor , where her eyes should have been . As if he knew what she was thinking , he said , " The bloody thing covers your eyes . You have beautiful eyes , Mel . " She felt like he had stabbed her through her heart . <p> " Do n't lie to me , " she said . <p> His gaze was steady . " I 've never lied to you , " he replied . <p> She looked at his hand on her knee , where the ring glinted . " Yes , you have , " she said , even though this was n't exactly true , as she 'd never asked him if he was married . She had always assumed that he was n't . <p> He seemed confused at first , then he realized that she was looking at his ring . " Oh , " he said . " That 's what I had to tell you . Why I was n't here last week . I got married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Yes . I should have told you . But it was really a lastminute thing . " <p> Mel backed the chair across the patio . " Good luck to both of you , " she said . " I 'm sure she 's very beautiful . " She was thankful this time that the voiceboard droned mechanically . It could almost sound sincere . She did n't want John to know that she was foolish enough to care . <p> He stopped the chair with one hand , just as she was about to go through the open glass door into the Center . " She is beautiful , " John said . " She 's going to have my baby . " <p> A cry came from somewhere deep inside of Mel . She masked it with a cough . Let him think she was still choked up from the cigarette . She would endure whatever she had to endure before he left , and then she would go back into her room . She would take away the voiceboard , and turn off the visor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would not move . She would not jerk , so that he could n't possibly imagine that she wanted to go on with it . She would wait until he tapped twice , then clench her hand tightly , with all her strength . She would let them think that the visual implants had damaged her . Somehow , she would get them to take the damn thing off . Tear it off herself , if she had to . She could make her hands obey , if she tried hard enough . Then , she would be blind again . She would n't eat . Eventually , they would hook her up to machines , which would feed her . What was left of her body would waste away ; then , real darkness . <p> John was talking , in the hard , street-wise tone she 'd heard earlier from him . Mel refused to look at him . <p> " Alexandra and I have been together for a while . When she told me about the baby , it seemed like the right thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . I 'm not like that , " he said . <p> " Good , " Mel said , when he said nothing for a while . <p> John took her hand . Mel stared at the blank patio wall . Ugly gray bricks . She began to count them . <p> " Look , I 'll never forget you , " he said . " You 've kept me going . " " Right , " she said . <p> He squeezed her hand , then stroked her wrist and toyed with the bracelet . <p> " Take it away , " she said . " I do n't want it . " <p> A wet drop hit her hand . John 's voice , when he spoke again , sounded strange and thick . As if he was crying . It could n't have been a tear , she told herself . Men did n't cry . <p> " No , " he said . " It was for you . I thought you might be able to put it in the probe . To protect you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she repeated . " Damn you . I 'm not going anywhere . " <p> He tugged on the bracelet , but did n't remove it . " Oh , Mel , " he said . " You 've got to go ! " <p> " Never , " she said . " Go away . Take your cheap bracelet and go back to your wife . " There - she had said it . Now , he 'd leave . <p> He said nothing for a long while , then she felt his hand , lightly stroking her hair . No - she would not turn . She 'd never look at him again . <p> " I did lie to you , " he said , in a low voice . " That bracelet cost me a day 's pay . " <p> " Bully for you , " she said . What a liar he was . It was just cheap beads , probably plastic . <p> " I had my eye on it for weeks . I had the fellow put it aside and I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to you . " <p> Work ? What was he talking about ? <p> " I lied to you about what I do , " John said . " I 'm no viddy star . I work mornings at the Virgin store and afternoons I work at my step-dad 's shop . Those were someone else 's tunes you heard . Stuff I listen to for myself . Real musicians . " <p> Mel drew in a sharp breath . Not a viddy start <p> " My step-dad repairs guitars and sitars and such . That 's how I know about them . Yeah , I play a little , " he said . <p> Mel 's fingers went to the voiceboard . " You should have said , " she said . " You did n't have to pretend . I - " she paused , moving her fingers tentatively back and forth . " I liked you for you . " <p> Another tear fell on the back of her hand . " I wanted to impress you . When I first came , the nurses made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . It pumped me up a bit . When you believed them , I thought , why not play along ? It went from there . " <p> " You never told me why , " Mel said . <p> " Why what ? " She turned toward him , to see his handsome face once more . His eyes were swollen - yes , he had been crying . <p> " Why you came to visit . Someone like me . " <p> " Oh , that , " he said , shaking his head . He drew the back of his hand across his eyes . " Uh , well , I 'm a Christian . It was part of my service to the church . Every two weeks . We all do something and this was my thing . " <p> " Oh , " she said , turning away . Of course . It would be something like that . <p> John seemed to realize her disappointment . He reached toward her , then drew back , as if he knew that touching her was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It became more than that , " he said . " So much more . I mean , you 're so brave . You 're so much more than I 'll ever be , Mel I do n't know how I can make you see that . " <p> " I 'm an ugly cripple in a chair , " she said . <p> " No , " he said , and he grabbed the chair , whirling her around . He put his hands on her face , then kissed her again , hard . Just as quickly , he drew back , then put his face beside hers , holding her shoulders tightly against him . Again , that intoxicating smell of his cologne and skin , the warm feel of his body . His hands hurt her shoulders , but she did n't struggle . <p> " You 've got to go , Mel . You 've got a chance to help everyone . You ca n't throw it away . " <p> " How can you touch me ? " she asked , feeling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His breath was hot , his voice fierce . " God , it 's not what 's outside . Look at me . Handsome , right ? I 'll never be anything . I 'm just another working man . I 'll live , I 'll die , just like everyone else . But you 've got it inside , " he said , putting his palm against her chest , pressing down , toward her heart . <p> " John , " she said . " John . " <p> " You go on that trip , " he said . " Get on the ship . Your body 's nothing . Leave it behind . " <p> Tears streamed from Mel 's eyes into the visor , pooling around its lower edge . John moved his body , knocking the voiceboard to the patio . Mel heard it clatter , then a blinding colored light shot through the visor . Her body stiffened . <p> She heard John cry out , realizing dimly that she was on the patio , and she knew what it was - a seizure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought they were long past . <p> All she could see was white , not black . Mel 's body was jerking , out of control , and something hurt in her mouth , then came a strong , hot taste of copper . She heard footsteps , then Hana , crying for the other nurses . <p> " My God , I 've killed her , " John said in a terrible , choked voice . <p> " No , no , damn it ! You dumb kid , it 's the implants , " came a twangy , American voice . The ISA counselor was there . Mel 's arms and legs stopped jerking - the visor flickered in and out . She was off the patio . Somehow , they 'd gotten her back in her room . Time passed strangely during seizures , she recalled . Her senses were not to be trusted . <p> Then , the white changed , became a field of stars . Mel felt suddenly warm and calm , completely in control . It was she , floating , toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pinkish nebula . Below her , blank space . How much more she wanted to go to the nebula than down into the blackness . <p> How beautiful it was . Complete , ordered , everything in its place . And exciting also , because a star before her , a bare pinpoint of light , was growing brighter and brighter until she thought she could kiss it . She sensed things , felt things she did not know names for ; only feelings , instincts , pictures in her mind . It was approaching . Closer and closer until she could see it was a small red thing , nothing like the sun that she 'd known as a child , though she 'd never seen that from above , nor from such a distance . <p> Could John see it as well ? No , he was not there ; she was gone , and so was he . They were very far apart . How easily her body moved , how elegantly , powerfully and simply . She was aware , dimly , of how delicate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . Like the small red star - the stranger - which she reached out to with her senses of spectral analysis , of direction , and asked it how long it had to live , and how long it had known life . It opened to her like a flower , like the beautiful flower of a hibiscus which her mother had kept outside their house . So red , so perfect , with a bit of a flare like the stamen of the hibiscus flower , and she reached with her senses .. and kissed the star .... It was exciting and intoxicating , magic and eternity ; mystery and wonder and within it like a seed , the evidence she sought , that yes , it was alive , here there could be life . <p> Then , someone , a flesh-and-blood person , touched her . Fingers pressing into her , and the star-flower shrank into itself . The warm blackness of space became white . <p> Faces appeared before her , hovering . Hana , her expression serious . John , his hand pushing his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cowboy ISA counselor . The two technicians , standing behind the others . Someone took her hand . A finger tapped her palm , once . <p> It was her decision , hers alone . And she knew what John had said was right . Her body really was nothing . And oh .. she had kissed the star . She did not know whether the vision had come from inside of her , or it had been something cleverly planted , perhaps something to make her want to go . She realized that she did not care , because she wanted to go now , more than anything else , because this was life - a new kind of life . It had been heaven to kiss John ; but to kiss a star ? <p> With all her might , Mel squeezed the finger . <p> The counselor laughed . " She 's game , " he said . " She 's going . " <p> Mel knew that she could n't trust her voice , and beneath the visor , they could not see her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " John looked wildly from face to face , searching for answers . How Mel wished she could say something . She shook her arm , rattling the bracelet . Still , John did n't seem to understand . <p> " She 's going to Epsilon Eridani , son , " the counselor said to John . " In about three weeks . " <p> Mel squeezed the counselor 's finger again . <p> " Uh-uh-mmm go-ing , " she said , looking up at John 's face , relishing the expression of joy as it spread over his face . The words came out so easily . It was like something which had been holding her back had broken away inside when she had flown the heavens . Now her tongue and lips moved as she wished . <p> John , beautiful John . If she could not be normal , then she could have this other thing . And John had been right - no one else could have it . Only Mel . She did n't need to believe in Jesus , only in what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what Jesus would do , " she said . <p> John touched her cheek , smiling as he wept , his eyes silently questioning her . <p> " He would kiss the star , " she told him . <p> Author Affiliation
