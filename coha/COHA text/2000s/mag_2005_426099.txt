Like most women , you probably walk a fashion tightrope : Overdo it and you risk ridicule ; downplay it and you are equally condemned // This is the story of how I almost caused a riot by wearing a Burberry kilt and black boots to the vice president 's house . I was invited to the Cheneys ' official residence for Scooter Libby 's book party about four years ago . I got the date of the party mixed up , so I was n't as formally or soberly dressed as I would have been if I had remembered sooner . But I surveyed what I was wearing-a black shirt , a Burberry skirt , black opaque patterned tights , and black high-heeled boots-and decided I was presentable . Besides , I did n't want to miss a rare chance to see Dick Cheney , the Darth Vader of the Bush administration , poking his head aboveground , out of his secure Undisclosed Location . After the party , some conservatives chided me online about my scandalous attire , tut-tutting that I had dissed the vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I too Scottish ? I was sure he was more concerned with the color-coded terror alerts than with my plaid kilt . The rules about what to wear to be taken seriously are more muddled and confusing than ever . You just have to be extremely careful about whether you stand out in a positive way , a negative way , or even a debatable way . Long ago and far away , on a distant planet called Feminism , women thought they would n't have to worry about how they looked or be slaves to fashion anymore . The important thing would be how we thought about the world and what we did in it . That turned out to be piffle . Feminism has been defeated by narcissism . Consider the case of George W. Bush 's latest Supreme Court nominee , Harriet Miers . From the moment the president 's 60-year-old lawyer from Texas became news , people focused on three things : her lack of judicial experience , her heavy eye makeup , and her weird wardrobe . Her debut appearance was in a frumpy blue suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hill to confer with senators , she teamed a turquoise jacket with a zebra-patterned scarf . This was certainly the first time the words animal-skin print and Supreme Court had been used in the same sentence in newspaper stories , and it raised the burning question : Do we really want a swing justice who can affect women 's rights for a generation who , as Jon Stewart joked , has never been a judge but " has clearly been a Talbots frequent shopper " ? Washington writer Sally Quinn confesses her confusion over Ms. Miers . " I look at her and think , She 's dowdy , so I guess that means she 's okay to be on the Supreme Court . If she were a real babe , Fd think that would n't be acceptable for the Supreme Court . On the other hand , then I start thinking that Miers is too dowdy to be on the Supreme Court . " Looks also took center stage when presidential candidate Howard Dean 's doctor wife , Judith Steinberg , was pictured during his 2004 Democratic primary campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old jeans , unstyled hair , and no makeup . Some people praised her authenticity , but others thought it damaging to her husband 's chances . " You ca n't look like that if you want to win , " Quinn says flatly . " I really admire Judy Dean , but she really believed this lie that we have come beyond that , and we have n't come beyond that . " Today professional women have to be mindful of what they signal and reveal with their personal style . When secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reviewed American troops in Wiesbaden , Germany , wearing a fashionable long black coat and black leather stiletto boots this past winter , it made international news . Afterward , when I asked her about it , she just smiled slyly and replied , " It was cold out there . " It 's still a catch-22 for women . If you pay too much attention to fashion and looks , you may be deemed superficial ; if you do n't pay enough , you may be deemed sloppy . My friend Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a director of government relations at Fannie Mae in D.C. , complains , " Women have an edge if they 've got their look together , but they get penalized if they look too slutty . You 're always balancing on a fine line . " I 'm constantly asked by my male colleagues-the nonmetrosexuals-how much I spend on shoes and how many pairs I own . Do I ask them what they spent on their superhigh-tech home-movie theaters ? No . It makes me defensive . " My lovely niece Jennifer Dowd , a 36-year-old lawyer at the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims , says she also goes through " angst . " She decided for an important speech recently to forgo both makeup and a flattering suit . " As a professional , you never want to detract from the message , " she tells me . " Men are never up against this since they look the same all the time-in the gym , waking up , wearing a suit . " Quinn faces the same dilemma whenever she has to go on television . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have good makeup . But then I think if I do that , I wo n't be taken seriously . But if I look older and dowdy , they wo n't want me on television . " If you think it 's gotten easier for professional women , just mention the word hair . " No one hears a word you say until they get past your hair , " moans Dee Dee Myers , Bill Clinton 's former press secretary , who 's now a political commentator . " When I went on the Today show to talk about impeachment , three-quarters of the e-mails I got were about my hair . " Amy Pascal , chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment 's Motion Picture Group , agrees : " Whether I like it or not , it 's always about my hair . " Women are jealous of how easy it is for men . As Ariel Kaminer , 36 , the new Arts &; Leisure editor of The New York Times , notes wryly : " It 's really , really , really easy for a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal office , what does it take ? I 'll bet 10 Thomas Pink shirts , 4 Banana Republic flat-front trousers , and a pair of Kenneth Cole shoes would put you in the running for most fashionable guy on your floor . Yet to seem well dressed ( and in all the contexts in which they have to dress ) , women need a wardrobe large enough to sink a small seafaring vessel . " While unrelenting upkeep may be necessary in our personal lives because of men , it may be necessary in our professional lives because of women . " Women are always going to be damned if they do and damned if they do n't , not because of men but because of women , " says Anne Schroeder , the 26-year-old executive editor of Capitol File magazine in D.C. " As we know , women are hardest on other women . It 's a competition thing .
