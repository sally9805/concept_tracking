<p> When Jason Campbell was told to report to Coach Joe Gibbs 's office after a team meeting Monday afternoon , he felt jittery , like he was back in school being ordered to the principal 's office . Instead , he was greeted with the best news of his professional life . <p> After 27 games of being inactive and holding a clipboard as the Washington Redskins ' third quarterback , Campbell was told he would be the starter Sunday against Tampa Bay , 19 months after he was drafted 25th overall in April 2005 . All the days spent throwing footballs through a tire hanging from a tree in the back yard of his boyhood home of Taylorsville , Miss. , the years spent honing his skills under his father 's guidance , then leading Auburn to the top of college football , finally will lead to him playing in an NFL game . <p> " It 's a new era with me , " Campbell said yesterday . " From my standpoint , I just want to continue being myself and just work hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-6 , performing well below expectations and with veteran quarterback Mark Brunell unable to coax more points and big plays from what was supposed to be a dynamic attack . <p> Campbell , 6 feet 4 and 228 pounds , is hoping to merely feel comfortable enough in this pressure-packed setting to do what he has done before : control a huddle and stay calm under duress ; elude the rush and make plays on the run ; throw the ball accurately and avoid backbreaking turnovers ; keep the defense honest with deep throws when need be . <p> If he can be as successful as he was in high school and college , the Redskins will have solved their 12-year quest for a long-term answer at quarterback , dating from Super Bowl winner Mark Rypien . And if he fails after all the Redskins have invested in him , the team will face another crisis at the most important position on the field , and Gibbs 's attempt to restore the franchise to past glory will have suffered a devastating blow . <p> Campbell has played only a few quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2005 , and has rarely even practiced with Washington 's starters , making an assessment of his development difficult . <p> " If you 're going to go wrong at the quarterback position , go wrong with things I can look at , " said former quarterback Phil Simms , now a CBS analyst who studied all of Campbell 's games from his senior season . " And I know now he 's big . I know he has decent movement for a guy his size and can take a hit and withstand punishment . I know he has a very good NFL arm . I 've never met him and I do n't know anything else about him , but I know that , and that 's a dang good start . " <p> Campbell was raised in tiny Taylorsville , a coach 's son who did little besides play football , basketball and baseball . Campbell was the pride of the area , leading Taylorsville High School to a state title before heading to Auburn as one of the nation 's top prospects . <p> The turmoil Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redshirted ) , with a new offensive system and new offensive coordinator in each of his final four years there and fans screaming for him to lose his starting job in his first three seasons , may have provided the best preparation for life as an NFL quarterback . He and the program struggled early , but players and teammates said Campbell never complained about the revolving door of offensive coaches , or being benched at times as a freshman and sophomore . <p> " Jason will fit in anywhere , " Auburn Coach Tommy Tuberville said after the draft . " He 's very unassuming , he does n't have a big ego and he 's willing to learn and change things and adapt . " <p> Campbell would organize his teammates for voluntary practices and workouts in the offseason and visited underclassmen in the dorms , helping keep them out of trouble . By the midpoint of his senior season , fans were showing up at his apartment for pictures and autographs . In Al Borges , his offensive coordinator that season and a noted quarterback coach , Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passes as a senior  --  second best in school history  --  for 2,700 yards , with 20 touchdowns and seven interceptions . He finished 31-8 at Auburn , the most wins by any Tigers quarterback , and owns the school 's best career completion percentage . He started in four straight bowl games , and led the team to a 13-0 record as a senior , including a Southeastern Conference title and Sugar Bowl victory . <p> " The things I like about Jason are , I think , the same things Coach Gibbs likes about him , " Borges said last year from his office overlooking Auburn 's practice fields . " He can throw in the pocket and he can also throw outside the pocket and he can escape situations a lot of times when the protection breaks down . You can roll him out . You can bootleg him . You can naked bootleg him . You can three-step drop him . You can do darn near anything you want , and he can see all the throws and he can make all the throws . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-mannered young man . <p> He was wowed by the physical prowess and countless athletic attributes Campbell possessed , and brought his entire staff down to Auburn to meet the prospect . After that visit , the Redskins ' interest was heightened , and they parted with three draft picks , including their first-round selection in 2006 , to get an additional first-round pick from Denver and use it on Campbell despite having Brunell and 2002 first-round pick Patrick Ramsey already on the roster . <p> " We spent a whole morning with him in a motel room , and we asked him about every question you could ask , " Gibbs said Monday . " We put plays on the board and talked about things and talked about football . And I think in Jason we 've got somebody whose dad was a coach , he understands sports and he 's been a brilliant athlete . Now we just have to go to work here . With all of us supporting him and everything , we certainly think we 've got somebody who 's very talented and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NFL scouts worried that Campbell was a one-year wonder in college , another product of Borges 's system who might struggle in the professional ranks ( such as Borges 's pupils Kyle Boller and Cade McNown ) . They pointed to the two Auburn running backs who were among the top five picks in the 2005 draft and the overall talent on the team , and wondered how much the Tigers ' success had to do with Campbell 's outstanding senior season . <p> " I was very impressed with Jason at the Senior Bowl , " former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams , a Tampa Bay Buccaneers personnel executive , said this past summer . " And I think from a game standpoint for a guy to be that big and nimble and with his decision-making , that 's what made him so good . He 's able to move around and get outside the pocket and make plays , and he can step up and put the ball downfield . He 's everything you can expect from a guy that size . " <p> The Redskins are hoping that durability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense that has been unable to capitalize on a trio of highly paid wide receivers who are expected to be playmakers  --  Santana Moss , Antwaan Randle El and Brandon Lloyd  --  or get the ball downfield with any regularity . <p> " I 'm very excited for this , " guard Randy Thomas said . <p> If Campbell struggles , as most young quarterbacks do , he can hand off to running backs T.J. Duckett and Ladell Betts . Campbell already was chatting with Baltimore Ravens starter Steve McNair , a longtime friend , and Philadelphia Eagles star Donovan McNabb for advice Monday night , and will study film and work with the wide receivers after practices this week . <p> He has not played four full quarters of football in nearly two years and must regain his timing . But Borges still can recall Campbell 's poise throughout that 2004 season , calling audibles and shepherding the offense in front of nearly 110,000 screaming fans at Tennessee , and expects the same unflappable quarterback to emerge in the NFL . <p> " You get pretty much the same look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Borges said during that interview in his office . " He does n't get shook up . " <p> The sights and the sounds now largely will be the same , but the stakes are much higher . The next few years will tell if Campbell 's production will be unchanged as well , or if the Redskins ' quarterback carousel will spin on . <p> " The time is mine , " Campbell said . " The only thing I can do is go with it . "
