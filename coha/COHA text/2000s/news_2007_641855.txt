<p> Eight Denver elementary schools next year would close and five schools would be reborn in a reform effort intended to improve student achievement and save about $3.5 million a year . <p> Denver Public Schools officials Monday announced the much-anticipated reform plan to a crowded Tivoli Student Union on the Auraria campus at the same time the first pitch was being thrown across town at the crucial Colorado Rockies game . <p> School officials knew which event held more impact for Denver 's future . <p> " I 'm not sure anything being done tonight is more important for the city , " said Superintendent Michael Bennet . " This should leave us feeling pretty optimistic about the next five years of the school district versus the last five years . Denver Public Schools is going to be a much better place to be a kid . " <p> The plan , which would be the largest school closure in DPS history , recommends closing Whiteman and Fallis in southeast Denver ; Smedley and Remington in northwest Denver ; and Hallet , Mitchell and Wyman in northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed earlier this year due to low enrollment . <p> The proposal also would change academic programs at five schools , creating preschool through eighth grade at Cole and Horace Mann middle schools ; an arts academy for grades six through 12 at what is now Kunsmiller Middle School ; an infant through eighth grade Montessori at the current Gilpin K-8 ; and a preschool through eighth grade magnet school geared to English-language learners at what is now Pace Middle School . <p> The school board will make the final decision on school closures at its Nov. 19 meeting . <p> The shake-up , which DPS expects will directly affect 3,000 kids and about 340 teachers and staff , is part of an ongoing larger reform plan over the past two years . <p> The district has been losing millions of dollars as students opt out of Denver Schools . Coupled with budget cuts and retiree costs , DPS has been reeling financially . This reform would allow the district to reinvest more money into its schools , Bennet said . <p> Schools tabbed for closure are low-performing and have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of its space . Administrators hope the creation of new and better schools will draw back 5,000 students . <p> By shuttering eight schools , DPS expects a net savings of $3.5 million per year that could be reinvested , with $2 million to the schools receiving displaced students , $700,000 for underperforming schools and $700,000 for the development of new schools . <p> The district wants to expand its preschool program for 4-year-olds from 4,000 half-day slots to 4,000 full-day spots next year . <p> Administrators also want to refinance the DPS pension fund , which could free up between $14 million and $18 million a year that could be reinvested into schools . <p> School closures controversial <p> Closing schools is one of the most divisive and controversial moves in public education . <p> During Monday 's mostly sedate presentation about the proposed changes , school board candidate Rita Montero jumped up and shouted that the closures would disproportionately affect Latino and African-American students . <p> " They 're all kids of color , " she said . " None of you seems to care about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisory committee that drafted criteria for DPS to use when deciding on closures , said the district is 80 percent Latino and African-American and closures would naturally affect those students . <p> Former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb , also on the committee , called Montero 's outburst a campaign stunt and that any time the district makes a change , it affects minorities . <p> " If you have a chocolate cookie , and you cut that down , most of what you get is going to be chocolate , " he said . <p> Many teachers in affected schools were stunned by the news , which they learned about in meetings with administrators after school Monday . <p> At Whiteman Elementary , teachers emerged from the meeting with red- <p> rimmed eyes . Some wiped tears away . Others were angry . <p> " Bennet never taught , and he 's the one making decisions , " said one teacher , who asked not to be identified . <p> Another teacher , Bev Morgensen , said she may retire after 20 years at the school . She said Whiteman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population with families of pilots from Lowry Air Force base to one that now has a significant population of refugee children . <p> " I feel bad for my colleagues because they do n't have a say , " said Morgensen , noting that many do n't have , as she has , the years of service that would allow them to retire . <p> " It 's pretty nerve-racking for the teachers , " said Alicia Fajohn , 30 , a student teacher at Remington Elementary , slated for closure with students moving to an expanded Horace Mann . " It 's frustrating to know you have start over and re-interview for jobs . " <p> Outside Fallis Elementary School , teachers huddled in groups , some with tears streaming down their face . They said they were hopeful their students , 94 percent of whom are English-language learners , would have better opportunities at their new school next year . <p> But it will be hard to say farewell to Fallis . <p> " We love these kids , " said Heidi Tyler , who has taught at Fallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . " <p> Teachers said they had no idea their school was chosen for closure . <p> " This was total news , " said Eddy Reyes , who teaches English-reading intervention . " This has been a wonderful school . These kids are marvelous , and I will miss them . " <p> Something needed to be done <p> Maria Laarman , a fourth-grade teacher at Mitchell , said she understood the district had to do something , but " you ca n't help but take it personally at first : ' Why ca n't I provide a great education for my students ? " ' <p> The closure recommendation was expected at Hallet elementary . <p> Principal Roberta Mantione said that she was n't surprised because half of the school building was empty . <p> " Nobody was shocked by the announcement , " said the second-year principal . " The children were fabulous today . They were exceptionally happy . They were so beautiful . Letting go of the children is so hard . " <p> Erik Myhren , a fourth-grade teacher who has been at Hallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . " I grew up in this community , and the kids will still be in this community , " he said , " so I 'll go wherever the kids are . " <p> Bryan Fitch , a junior at the Denver School of the Arts who went to Manual High School before it closed in 2006 , said he was empathetic for the students at the shuttered schools , " but at least they got a heads-up more than we did . We found out our school was closing on the news . I just hope they can brace themselves and get used to a new environment . " <p> The decision on which schools to recommend for closure was based on a variety of factors , but officials say the prevailing goal was to send students to better schools . <p> " It 's a good first step , " said school board member Jeannie Kaplan . " I hope we are able to provide a better education for all of our kids . " <p> Plans also call for soliciting outside help in developing new schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will establish a process on how to consider the long- term use of the closed buildings and whether to lease them or sell them . <p> Plans are also in place to employ four " choice liaisons " who will work directly with families of students affected by the closures and to help them figure out their options . <p> The community committee will review how the district applied the criteria , and the school board will vote on the closures Nov. 19 . <p> Staff writers Christopher Osher , Mark P.
