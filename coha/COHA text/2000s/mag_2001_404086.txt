Some web sites make it all too easy to get medicine without getting appropriate medical advice . <p> One morning not long ago , Consumer Reports senior editor Tod Marks logged onto the Internet and did a simple search using the phrase " prescription drugs for sale . " In seconds , the names of 150 sources appeared onscreen , nearly one-third of them accompanied by troubling boasts , such as , " No prescription ? No doctor ? No problem . " <p> No kidding . In a follow-up investigation to " Relief for the Rx Blues " ( October 1999 ) , we found that despite claims of increased scrutiny by government regulators and medical and pharmacy-industry trade groups , suspect web sites that sell prescription drugs are flourishing . Ordering medications online without benefit of a proper diagnosis remains about as easy as clicking your way through cyberspace for books or clothes . Unfortunately , an ill-prescribed drug can carry far more serious consequences than a bad ending or a bad fit . <p> Without visiting or speaking to a doctor , Marks was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose weight , quit smoking , combat osteoporosis , and fight aging , depression , seasonal allergies , and bacterial infection . Except for the antihistamine , which might have helped his hay fever , Marks , a healthy 44-year-old nonsmoker , had no business taking those medications . <p> Sites like those Marks visited are estimated to number in the hundreds , and they 're only likely to multiply . Jupiter Communications , which tracks Internet businesses , projects that the annual sale of prescription drugs online will rise from about $23 million to nearly $1 billion over the next few years . Many of those sites will be legitimate , of course , but others will be established by companies looking to make a fast buck off consumers intent on treating themselves . Clearly , there 's a demand for these pharmacies , termed " rogue " by government regulators and lawmakers . Just as clearly , there should n't be . According to the American Medical Association , the Federation of State Medical Boards , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , and the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best and illegal at worst . HOW TO TELL ROGUE FROM RIGHT <p> Long before the Internet existed , Congress and state legislators enacted safeguards to protect patients from unsafe and counterfeit drugs , and from unethical doctors and pharmacists . Before receiving medicine for the first time , a patient is generally interviewed and examined by a licensed doctor , who issues a prescription for an FDA-approved drug . The prescription is then filled by a registered pharmacist working in a licensed pharmacy that meets state standards . <p> Legitimate online pharmacies such as CVS.com , an adjunct to the drugstore chain , as well as properly licensed Internet-only drugstores such as PlanetRx.com and drugstore.com , follow those procedures . They require confirmation from your doctor for any drug you request and let you e-mail or phone questions to a pharmacist . To open an account , you submit credit-card and insurance information . The pharmacy openly lists facts about its licensing . <p> Although rogue sites can look as sophisticated as legitimate ones , they do n't require a similar chain of responsibility . They work in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally offer an online " consultation " with a doctor . It costs as much as $85 and typically consists of answering a questionnaire covering your medical history . If you pass muster with the doctor , he or she then issues a prescription to whatever pharmacist the web site uses . You see no person ; you receive no paper , only an e-mail confirming your order . As part of the consultation , you promise to tell the truth , use the drug properly , and free everyone connected with the site from liability if complications arise . Kansas Assistant Attorney General Fran Brunner described that last agreement as an " unconscionable " ploy to discourage consumers from filing suit or complaining . <p> Rogue sites based overseas can be even more lax . They usually let people order without answering any questions . Customers just type in the name and quantity of the desired drug , click " order , " and submit their credit-card information and address . <p> That process is illegal , says the FDA , for a few reasons . First , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities . ( Americans may , however , carry into the U.S. small quantities of prescription drugs they 've bought abroad for personal use . ) Second , the prescribing foreign doctors are n't licensed in the U.S. Third , drugs made in other countries may not have been approved by the FDA . Foreign sites often sell drugs that are available over the counter overseas but only by prescription in the U.S.  --  but that 's illegal , too . <p> When rogue sites first surfaced , they typically peddled remedies to help people lose weight , grow hair , or improve sexual performance  --  in other words , to deal with conditions that patients might be reluctant to discuss with their doctor . People tended to see such " vanity " or " lifestyle " drugs ( most notably Viagra ) as more frivolous than others . They 're not , of course . Moreover , some conditions allayed by such drugs have underlying causes that are far from obvious . Impotence , for instance , can be caused by a pituitary tumor , diagnosed only through a physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viagra , warns against buying the drug on the basis of an online questionnaire . ) <p> These days , the sites sell almost everything from Allegra to Zyban , including often-overprescribed antibiotics . Details on our own shopping expedition are in " Why It Pays to Play by the Rules , " on the facing page . What we could n't buy  --  narcotics , stimulants , depressants , and anabolic steroids  --  are controlled substances regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration . DEA officials scrutinize prescriptions for those often-abused drugs to track down and prosecute people who sell or buy them illegally . HERE 'S THE HARM <p> Whichever drugs are offered , one tip-off for a questionable site is a pitch saying you 'll need no doctors , no appointments , no waiting rooms . To Dr. James Winn , executive vice president of the Federation of State Medical Boards , those are fighting words . " It 's a dangerous situation for the American people , " says Winn . <p> Here 's why : <p> Insufficient medical review . The questionnaires we answered ranged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical history and current conditions . Often , though , even the better questionnaires missed something a personal physician would have been likely to catch , says Dr. Marvin M. Lipman , Consumer Reports ' chief medical adviser , who has practiced medicine for 40 years . <p> If you tell the whole truth and your answers raise a red flag  --  say you have high blood pressure  --  sites are likely to spit out the questionnaire and reject your request . That 's because the web sites are typically programmed to note undesirable or suspicious answers and to turn down anyone who fails to meet certain criteria . <p> However , as we learned , the system is n't foolproof . For one thing , sometimes sites do n't reject a problematic request . When Marks tried to buy Zyban , prescribed for smokers who want to quit , Confidential Rx ignored his notation that he did n't smoke . He got the Zyban . <p> He also got somatropin ( Saizen ) , an injectable human growth hormone usually prescribed for children with growth deficiency but sometimes abused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had a physical exam in the past year , GHMedical.com rejected his order . When he falsely said he had had a physical yet told the truth about his height , the site saw no problem in sending the drug to Marks , a slightly short but by no means stunted middle-aged man . <p> For another thing , people who want a drug are likely to stretch the truth . And when they do that , a lot can go wrong . A 90-pound anorexic who claims to weigh 290 can get a diet drug , a 12-year-old kid can get a muscle-building drug . The truth is , there 's little to stop anyone , through ignorance of their own health or through mischief , from buying almost any prescription drug . ( For his part , Marks usually told the truth . He fibbed about that physical exam and about his weight , to get the diet drug Meridia . ) <p> Finally , the people doing the prescribing might be outright frauds . Last summer , a Department of Justice spokesman told us , a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Norfolk Men 's Clinic on a series of charges , including writing phony prescriptions and charging consumers for medical consultations that they allege never occurred . The case has yet to go to trial . <p> All of this reinforces the need for doctors to see that people are who they say they are and to ascertain , through an exam , whether patients have a condition that could make taking certain medications a fatal error . Incomplete instructions . When you fill a prescription at a legitimate venue , you receive a pharmacist 's printout of instructions and warnings . Only two of the rogue pharmacies from which we ordered sent such a printout . Once , the information was not even correct : Zyban , the antismoking drug , came with instructions for taking Viagra . The rest left us to learn about dosage and side effects from the box itself and from the manufacturer 's fine-print information sheet that comes with any drug . Questionable quality . We ordered four drugs  --  Fosamax , Zithromax , Prozac , and Renova ( tretinoin , an antiaging cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shipment arrived in an unmarked brown envelope with a return post office box labeled Bangkok , Thailand . The boxes containing the medicines were somewhat squashed and looked as if they 'd already been opened . Nowhere was there any indication of the patient 's name . Moreover , government officials warn that the drugs sold by rogue foreign sites could be contaminated , counterfeit , or outdated , or could have been stored improperly . Loss of privacy . Some sites have no stated policy about privacy , security , or confidentiality : Customers ca n't tell what happens to the medical and credit-card data they provide . Even sites that promise to keep such information private may not , says the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) . Last summer , the agency settled various claims against a group of pharmacies doing business under several web addresses including worldwidemedicine.com and focusmedical.com . The sites claimed that sensitive information could be viewed only by authorized people because it was encrypted . It was n't . Moreover , according to the FTC , the site operators planned to provide customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to try to bill those customers for work needed to make the web sites Y2K compliant . Without admitting wrongdoing , the sites agreed to disclose more information about their operations and about the doctors who prescribe . <p> Reporter Marks wondered about the privacy of his orders after receiving unsolicited e-mails promoting hard-core sex sites . <p> Lack of accountability . Because they 're not licensed to dispense drugs or because they do so in a way that violates the law , operators of rogue sites do n't usually divulge critical information about their operation : their owners ' names ; their location ; and the names , qualifications , and specialties of their consulting doctors . In fact , you 'd be hard pressed to contact a prescribing doctor . When Marks called the phone number on his bottle of Meridia and asked to speak to the doctor named on the bottle , his request was denied . PAYING THE PRICE <p> Patients may accept the risk of ordering from a rogue site because they think they 're getting a bargain , but our snapshot price comparison showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ordered ( and not accounting for any consultation fee or visit to a doctor ) , we often found little difference in price between good sites and bad . Somatropin actually cost far more at one rogue site than at a mainstream site . Moreover , you may have to pay that consultation fee each time you order a drug . Foreign sites tend to offer rock-bottom prices , but as we 've seen , they have many other problems . PAYING THE PENALTY <p> A wealth of federal and state agencies have control over at least a piece of the Internet pharmacy business . So far , there have been only a handful of criminal prosecutions or disciplinary actions , but more than 50 cases involving rogue sites are under investigation , says Tom McGinnis , the FDA 's director of pharmacy affairs . The FDA has stepped up enforcement recently  --  by sending cyber warning letters , for instance . In addition , several states have taken or are contemplating action against illegitimate online sellers . And 15 states have taken action against physicians prescribing over the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from abroad . Twenty drug-selling sites in Thailand alone were closed last year . During the same time , U.S. officials seized more than 1 million pills smuggled from that country into New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport . However , policing foreign sites is especially difficult , McGinnis says , because the U.S. lacks jurisdiction abroad and because as soon as one site is shut down , another opens . What 's more , the drugs are packed in everything from plain brown wrappers to hollowed-out books , and McGinnis concedes that such packages routinely avoid detection . <p> Stopping companies that sell drugs illegally could become easier under the Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2000 , introduced by a bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers last October . The act would make Internet sellers disclose their address , their telephone number , and the states in which they 're licensed , plus the name , specialties , and licensing information of anyone giving medical consultations . The bill , now in committee , is likely to resurface this term . <p> The act would also let state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against rogue sites , effectively putting them out of business across the country . ( Under existing law , an attorney general can stop a web site operator from selling drugs in his or her state only . ) Further , the act would let the Department of Justice keep foreign-based sellers from collecting payments from U.S. customers by freezing credit-card orders . <p> Any legislation that would increase accountability and oversight would be welcome . However , rogue sites wo n't go away without a curb on two enablers in the process : the doctors who review questionnaires and the customers . Doctors who participate can face criminal prosecution for prescribing across state lines without an appropriate license . They can also have their medical license suspended or revoked because writing prescriptions to unseen patients falls far below the acceptable standard of patient care . <p> Why would doctors take such risks ? <p> According to Carmen Catizone , executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy ( NABP ) , the motivation is often money . Doctors and other health-care practitioners , Catizone says , are recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month to review patient questionnaires . According to Kansas Assistant Attorney General Brunner , an Ohio doctor earned $41,000 in five months by writing prescriptions for rogue web sites . <p> Individual consumers who order drugs from rogue sites are unlikely to be punished , unless a controlled substance is involved or they 're receiving large amounts of prescription drugs from overseas . <p> YOU SAY TOMATO The antihistamine called Claritin in the U.S. is Claratyne in New Zealand . Whatever their spelling , drugs made and sold abroad have generally not been approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S. That did n't stop foreign companies from mailing them to our reporter . RECOMMENDATIONS <p> Ordering online is convenient for people who are pressed for time or homebound . But with any medical condition , it 's essential to obtain a proper diagnosis from a doctor who has examined you , taken a complete medical history , discussed alternative treatments , and made a commitment to follow up on your care . Here 's how to reap the convenience of ordering drugs online while ensuring you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites ( VIPPS ) seal . It 's designed to help consumers identify sites that are licensed and in good standing with regulatory agencies . The VIPPS program is sponsored by NABP , which is an umbrella group for the state pharmacy boards . across the country . To date , 15 sites representing 12,000 pharmacies ( including traditional brick-and-mortar drugstores run by many big chains ) are certified . New sites are continually being certified , so check with the NABP at www.nabp.net for the latest information . Do business only with a site that has access to a registered pharmacist who will answer questions . Do business only with a site that provides detailed information about itself , including a U.S. address and a phone number to contact if there 's a problem . Beware of sites that tout a " new cure " for a serious disorder or " amazing " results . Read the fine print on the web page . Sites under investigation list the names of states in which they 're barred from selling . If you suspect that a site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an e-mail to **25;531;TOOLONG .

Troubled orders <p> If you order from a site that does n't require a prescription from your doctor , problems can crop up anytime during the process . <p> TOP : The preview . GHMedical.com offered somatropin , an injectable human growth hormone often prescribed for children deficient in that hormone . What 's the muscled arm doing in the page 's upper right corner ? It may be tempting people who should n't be buying the drug . Somatropin has been abused by those looking to build muscle mass ( it 's also known as a " fountain of youth " drug ) . <p> CENTER : The consultation form . Our reporter admitted he does n't smoke , but Confidential Rx saw no problem in sending him Zyban , an antismoking drug . <p> BOTTOM : The result .

Why it pays to play by the rules <p> Given the time it takes to see a doctor and the high cost of medicine , it 's easy to see why some people would think about cutting corners . However , buying prescription drugs via unlicensed online pharmacies is like playing Russian roulette . Taking those drugs without the proper oversight can be riskier still .
