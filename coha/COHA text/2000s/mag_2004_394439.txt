to 1776 <p> To teach write , or read about the " colonial era " is a special challenge . No other part of American history is as remote from our own ; by the same token , none has been studied for as long . Revisions lie piled on revisions ; and divergent styles of scholarship are stretched across an extraordinary range . The tableau of colonial America constructed in , say , 1875 looks markedly different from its successors in 1920 and 1960 , and the latter bear only partial resemblance to predominant views today . <p> The list of books here embodies the work of the last generation or so . As such , its emphasis is social history : everyday life , ordinary people ; cultural tradition , popular mentality ; race , ethnicity , class , and gender . Still , that constitutes a very big tent , with no single organizing center . The authors themselves are a mixed lot : a semiotician , a biographer , a novelist , a little clutch of museum curators , plus several professional historians ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this , too , is emblematic . Precisely because of its remoteness , early American history has excited many different imaginations ; indeed it encourages - not to say , insists on - such diversity . <p> Two caveats . The list does not treat all of colonial America with an even hand ; some colonies and regions are more fully represented than others . Moreover , the list makes only light reference to chronology and , if anything , tilts somewhat toward the first part of the story . No doubt , in years to come these same elements will have a very different distribution , since historiography , no less than history itself , is ever-changing . <p> The Columbian Exchange : Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492 , by Alfred W. Crosby , Jr . ( 1972 ; Greenwood ) . This was , and is , a foundational work in the very lively sub-field of environmental history . It traces the Old World/New World transfer of life forms - plants , animals , humans , microorganisms - that began with Columbus and continued for generations thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Native American " demographic catastrophe " ( wholesale mortality among Indian populations , principally from the arrival of previously unknown disease pathogens ) , the highly controversial origins of syphilis , and a world-changing revolution in foodways . Implicitly it makes an even larger point - that 1492 remains the single most important date in modern history . Then did two worlds ( or three or four ) begin to become one , a process that continues still . <p> The Conquest of America , by Tzvetan Todorov ( 1982 ; English translation , 1984 ; University of Oklahoma ) . A European cultural theorist and semiotician here explores a vast existential issue , " the discovery self makes of the other " in a specifically American context . And as he does so , he throws a dazzling light on the history of cultural " encounter " between the colonizers and the colonized . His focus is sixteenth-century Mexico and the Caribbean ; Columbus and the conquistador Corts are among his chief characters . But the hopes , the doubts , the gutlevel fears , the chronic misunderstandings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : These ingredients were present everywhere Europeans , Indians , and Africans came together . <p> Changes in the Land : Indians , Colonists , and the Ecology of New England , by William Cronon ( 1983 ; new edition , 2003 ; Hill and Wang ) . This is environmental history brought literally to ground level . It shows , with great clarity and precision , the intricate dynamics of ecosystem change , especially the role of cultural values ( on the human side ) and biological adaptation ( on nature 's side ) . It also offers a different kind of vantage point for viewing the clash of colonists with native peoples . And it concludes with some suggestive foreshadowing of more modern developments , the most notable how a " people of plenty " began right away to become a " people of waste . " <p> American Slavery , American Freedom : The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia , by Edmund S. Morgan ( 1975 ; Norton ) . Considered a classic virtually from the moment of its publication , Morgan 's book " may be read as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be both more and less than that , " according to the author . Less , because it does n't try to cover every aspect of the subject ; more , because its main theme has the broadest possible reach . In the rough , disorderly atmosphere of seventeenth-century Virginia was born a linked commitment to individual rights on the one hand and racially based slavery on the other . And from this grew " the central paradox of American history , " freedom riding piggyback atop bondage . The tale , as told here , combines erudition and interpretive ingenuity with much narrative panache . Its tone is ironic , its import profound . <p> The Sot-Weed Factor , by John Barth ( 1960 ; Doubleday ) . Sometimes fiction conveys a truth to which academic scholarship does not ( can not ? ) aspire ; take Sot-Weed , for example . Set first in post-Elizabethan England , then in early Maryland , this long novel offers up an edgy , earthy , altogether human portrayal . Its central character , one Ebenezer Cooke , is a brilliant composite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( most remarkably ) diction . His Don Quixote-like exploits are realistic , outlandish , and , often enough , hugely funny . The result is time travel of die most absorbing kind ; moreover , Earth 's imagined world fits neatly with all we have learned from the usual run of documentary " facts . " <p> The Indians ' New World : Catawbas and Their Neighbors From European Contact Through the Era of Removal , by James Merrell ( 1989 ; Norton ) . Forty years ago Native Americans barely registered on any radar screen of colonial history . Now , thanks to a powerful new research enterprise - with the scholarly tag of " ethnohistory " - they have a central position . The Indians ' New World follows the Catawba people from their origins in the Carolina backcountry through their first dealings with white colonists , the resultant disease , a growing involvement in external trade , missionary contact , demographic and geographic reconfiguration , and , finally , the renewal of their tribal identity . At every point the book shows them not simply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a picture that applies broadly to other Indian groups as well . <p> The Life and Times of Cotton Mather , by Kenneth Silverman ( 1984 ; Welcome Rain ) . Puritanism : We ca n't avoid it , nor should we . And perhaps the best way to approach it is through its crankiest , most famous , most frequently stereotyped and caricatured American exemplar , the Boston minister Cotton Mather . Fortunately , Mather is the subject of the finest account of any individual life from early America . Read this book , and you know him . Moreover , the times no less than the life are fully presented here : society and economy , religion and science , the natural and the built environment , ideas , fashion , custom , and taste . Take it all together , and this is biography morphing into histoire totale . <p> Salem Possessed : The Social Origins of Witchcraft , by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum ( 1974 ; Harvard ) . Witchcraft is another subject impossible to avoid . Nothing else in the sprawling terrain of colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sensationalism . However , witchcraft has also attracted serious scholars , as a kind of prism for examining the inner-life dimension of early American ( especially Puritan ) experience . Witness the Boyer-Nissenbaum team 's remarkable Salem Possessed . Starting from a bit-by-bit dissection of the local community , the book moves outward and downward to uncover a host of hidden but fundamentally dynamic connections . Its endpoint - and the deepest , broadest connection of all - is an unexpected bridge between witch-hunting and early capitalism . Thus is Salem 's story rescued from the hands of antiquarians and hucksters and given lasting historical significance . <p> New England Begins : The Seventeenth Century , by Jonathan Fairbanks et al . ( 1982 ; Museum of Fine Arts , Boston ; out of print ) . Historical evidence comes to us in things no less than in words . And New England Begins was perhaps the supreme example of a historically informed - and informative - museum exhibition . Mounted some 20 years ago by Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts , it re-created a long-lost physical world - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of it , and , by dint of careful interpretive effort , much of its meaning as well . The range of objects included was enormous , from high-style parlor chairs , needle-work embroideries , and silver goblets to humble chamber pots , firedogs , clay pipes , and shovels . The show , like all shows , was evanescent ; fortunately , however , it lives on in a handsomely produced catalogue three volumes long . Here one can find a full array of excellent images together with 10 essays reflecting the best of recent material culture study . <p> Many Thousands Gone : The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America , by Ira Berlin ( 1998 ; Belknap ) . Only within the past decade have historians come to appreciate the centrality of chattel slavery in early American life . Take out slavery , most now agree , and everything would look different : economic growth and development , most obviously , but also social structure , cultural forms , even individual psychology . As much as or more than any other group , African-American bondsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . This is the burden of Many Thousands Gone , a sweeping overview of its inevitably painful subject . But the book does more than establish the matter of sheer importance ; it adds complexity and nuance by showing the many different forms slavery took , the concomitant growth of racist ideologies , and the never-ceasing struggle of the slaves themselves to resist , or at least to temper , the terms of their oppression .
