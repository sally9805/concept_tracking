<p> Somehow , sweet memories remain from those days . Before U.S. Olympic speedskater Ryan Cox broke his back , and after his mother had endured a bitter divorce , the two spent weekends cleaning mobile homes in Dawsonville , Ga. , at $25 a shot . His mother already was working two jobs , one as a cashier at Home Depot , but there was n't enough money to go around . Cindy Leveille remembers the surge of panic she felt when she saw just $500 in her bank account . <p> So she and her son , then 16 and a promising in-line skater , put on jeans and old shirts and took brooms and mops and buckets and rubber gloves , and they holed themselves up in other people 's bathrooms and kitchens every Saturday wondering how they had gotten to that point . Sometimes the heartbreaking hilarity of the scene would hit them , and they would have to rest on their broomsticks , laughing so hard they cried . <p> " I think we held each other together , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than she held me together . " <p> Five years later , in a Gainesville , Ga. , courthouse , Charles Ryan Cox legally changed his name to Charles Ryan Leveille ( Lev-ee-AY ) . His mother stood by his side , tears streaming down her face , when he explained to a judge why he wished to give up his father 's surname to take her maiden name , determined to show how much he appreciated her sacrifices in the most powerful way he could . <p> " I did it to honor her for everything she 's done for me , " he said of that day last May . " She 's the strongest woman I 've ever met . . . . She got me through everything . " <p> " The judge , " Cindy Leveille said , " was blown away . " <p> When her son found out he made his first Olympic team , in team pursuit , during a closed-door meeting on Dec. 31 in Salt Lake City , he asked a roomful of U.S. Speedskating officials if they could please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he hastily dialed his mother 's number , whispered the good news ( which elicited a scream ) and hung up . <p> There would be no such call to his father , Jimmy Wayne Cox . The two lost touch soon after the divorce in the spring of 2000 . <p> " My dad faded out of my life , " said Leveille , now 22 . " He did n't support me or my skating career . . . . He 's kind of gone off the face of the earth . " <p> Cox , a dental technician in Marietta , heard of his son 's name change through his daughter Jennifer , who has kept her old name and still sees her father occasionally . During a recent interview , his voice choked with sobs , he said it " broke his heart " to learn of his son 's feelings about him . He said he decided to stay home from the Olympics because he feared he would be a distraction . <p> " I 'd love to go to Turin but I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take away from his performance , " he said . " I 'm about to cry now because I would love to be there but I do n't think it would be good for him . <p> " There 's no way in the world  --  I 'm pretty emotional  --  I would n't want to hurt his chances at all . . . . I am so proud of Ryan . I do n't know how even to say how proud I am . . . . I love him and want to see the best for him no matter what went on . " <p> No one  --  not Cox , his son or Cindy Leveille  --  wished to discuss everything that went on . All agreed that Cox 's drinking played a part , though he says he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for eight years in the past . Cox contested the divorce with such vehemence a restraining order was granted . The relationship between father and son deteriorated so rapidly that they " had a knock-down , drag-out fight one day , " Cox said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself for it . " <p> Leveille said he was so traumatized after one such meeting that he went to the hospital hyperventilating and with spasms in his back . But his relationship with his father , he said , was n't always characterized by conflict . He said he has fond memories of water-skiing on the lake behind the family 's old house , skating , playing ball with his dad . " He was , " Leveille said , " my childhood hero . " <p> Said Cindy Leveille , " He loved the kids both so much , but it did decline , and it was through drinking that it declined . " <p> Cindy Leveille , who did not work during most of her children 's youth , kept the house after the divorce . Her daughter said she remembers that period for her mother 's absence : She always seemed to be at work . Cindy Leveille said alimony payments from Cox inevitably came late ; Cox contends he paid $3,000 a month to ensure his family was taken care of . <p> There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensured that her son 's promising skating career would not go by the wayside . <p> " She just made it happen , " he said . " She never let me miss a race . " <p> Already close , the two saw their relationships strengthen through their travels and travails . <p> " He was very attuned to what I was going through , " Cindy Leveille said . " I was upset and he was upset . " <p> Cox said he has some regrets about his behavior and choices but blames his ex-wife in part for the soured relationship with his son , adding : " I drink some . I 'm not going to tell you a lie . I still drink , but I 'm not a drunk . " <p> Cindy Leveille said she tried to be honest with her children about what was going on so they would understand . She consulted both before deciding to go ahead with the divorce . <p> " It 's a bad situation , " she said . " I do n't want to see it get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . . . . I hate to pour salt in the wounds . He was there when Ryan needed him at a young age . " <p> But by the time his son turned 16 , Cox was gone , part banished , part vanished . As Leveille 's life twisted and turned , it was his sister and mother  --  mostly his mother  --  to whom he desperately clung . Hoping to make the Winter Olympic team , he gave up his career in in-line skating in 2003 . He joined a short-track speedskating program in Huntington Beach , Calif. , and got immediate results . His success convinced him he could make the world championship team , and so he planned to compete at the 2004 U.S. championships . A week before the event , however , he fell on the ice , slid into a wall and broke his back . <p> He wore a body brace from his neck to his pelvis for four months . His doctor told him he came within an inch of paralysis . While his mother and her six brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the injury from Jennifer . The news , he said , hit hard . He , too , had endured a broken back . <p> " I sat on the side of the road when I heard about it , " Cox said , " and cried for an hour . " <p> When Leveille returned to short-track skating , he was n't the same . He had won a place at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs because of his progress before the injury , but he never settled in comfortably . His back remained so inflamed it took him 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning . Fearful of another calamitous injury , he competed hesitantly , poorly . He felt like an interloper among the more experienced skaters . <p> " I did n't have one ounce of fun there , " he said . So he quit . He went home . He changed his name . He planned to attend college , moving to Knoxville , Tenn. , where he took a job as a waiter hoping to win admittance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But a former coach at the training center , Tony Goskowicz , moved to Milwaukee and prodded Leveille to join him , insisting he should consider long-track speedskating , which involves skating against a clock rather than other competitors . Leveille was skeptical , but he agreed , flying to Milwaukee on a round-trip ticket whose return he never used . He fell in love with the sport again and could n't leave . Eight months after the move , he made the Olympic team . <p> Along the way , Goskowicz noticed something unusual about his talented student , besides the fact he transitioned quickly from one sport to another . Leveille constantly kept in touch with his mother . There were phone calls after breakfast , before taking the ice for practice , from restaurant tables , from the car , at night before going to sleep . <p> Cindy Leveille estimated that she and her son talk five to six times every day . She will be in Turin , watching from the stands when her son competes . For her , the Olympics will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to find the team pursuit on television , it will be something less . <p> " God knows I 'd love to sit there and watch him skate , " he said . " His dad 's behind him 100 percent . "
