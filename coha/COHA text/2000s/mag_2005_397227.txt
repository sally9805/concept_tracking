Section : SCIENCE NEWS This Week The inhumane exploitation of bears for traditional Asian medicine <p> As a consultant to the International Fund for Animal Welfare , Jill Robinson walked onto her first bear farm 12 years ago . At this facility in southern China , she found each bear standing not on a solid floor but on bars in a cage too small for the animal to take even one step . Although the Asiatic black bear is normally a solitary and clean animal , these cages were crowded together in buildings that could only be described as " filthy , " Robinson reports . <p> Worst of all , she says , was the bears ' evident suffering . Many had gnawed at the bars of the cages until their teeth cracked . Some repeatedly banged their heads against the bars , and most had open wounds . <p> The purpose of these farms was to supply bear bile  --  a prized ingredient in many traditional Chinese-medicine therapies . In powders , pills , and liquids , it 's used to treat conditions including eyesight problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Traditional medicine has been driving an active trade in bear bile and gallbladders , which produce it . Sales flourish despite a longstanding , near-global ban administered by the United Nations on international trade in bear parts and products . <p> In China , wild Asiatic black bears ( Ursus thibetanus ) are protected as endangered . However , it 's legal there to sell bile from bears on licensed farms . <p> Animal-protection groups have estimated that about half of the world 's Asiatic black bears reside in cages on farms , primarily in China , Vietnam , and Korea . Some farms have just one bear ; others-especially in China-can have several thousand . Each bear is milked regularly for bile in a painful and physically harmful procedure , or the bear is killed and bile is extracted from its gallbladder . <p> On subsequent farm visits , Robinson witnessed the staff extracting bile from bears by unplugging metal catheters that had been permanently inserted into their gallbladders . The bile dripped into collection pans beneath the cages . Seeing such " inhumane " animal treatment , Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Within 5 years , she had set up the Hong Kong-based Animals Asia Foundation . It operates a 25-acre sanctuary at Chengdu in China 's Sichuan Province that currently houses 168 bears rescued from farms that have shut down . Robinson is also working to find places for additional bears expected to become available in the near future . <p> Vietnam is a major bear-farming nation , despite laws that forbid the practice . Recently , an animal-welfare group negotiated with that country to enforce its laws and phase out bear farms . New technologies are being developed for policing this agreement and the international-trade ban . These tools are expected to come into use within the next year . <p> In North America , hunters kill American black bears and sell the gallbladders illegally . Although these bears are n't considered endangered , special agent Allen Hundley of the Fredericksburg , Va. , office of the Fish and Wildlife Service notes that any time an unregulated market " puts a price on the head of wildlife , " as it has on bears for their gallbladders , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BEAR FACTS Estimates remain sketchy , but wild populations of Asiatic black bears seem to have dropped to about 15,000 animals throughout all of Asia , says Dave Eastham of the World Society for the Protection of Animals ( WSPA ) in London . <p> Trafficking in bear parts is largely responsible for this decline , according to the Gland , Switzerland-based World Conservation Union . The group concludes that this species faces " a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium term . " <p> Heavy poaching prompted China , 25 years ago , to move some bears to licensed facilities . The resulting farms were expected to supply all the bile needed to fulfill traditional medicine 's demand-then about 500 kilograms of bile per year-says Eastham . <p> However , traditional medicine 's bile consumption has now reached 4,000 to 5,000 kg per year worldwide , he reports . China 's farmers manage at least 7,000 bears , and Vietnamese farms harvest bile from an estimated 4,000 bears . <p> Another 1,800 bears are caged in South Korea , but they are n't milked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're killed and their gallbladders harvested , Eastham says . In the wild , Asia 's black bears can survive to nearly 30 years old . <p> Today , supplies of farmed and poached bear bile exceed demand for bile used in Asian medicine , perhaps by up to 2,000 kg per year , Eastham 's group reports . So , a luxury market in Asia now offers consumer products that brag of their bear-bile content . They run the gamut-from hemorrhoid creams to shampoos to wines . <p> " Rather than supplying existing bile demand , " Eastham argues , " farming actually increased it . " <p> The chemical of interest is ursodeoxycholic acid , which has been found only in bear bile . At least a few scientific studies of the compound have supported traditional Chinese medicine 's claim that bile products benefit the liver , according to TRAFFIC North America , a joint program of the World Conservation Union and the Switzerland-based World Wildlife Fund , which studies international trade in threatened and endangered species . <p> An April 2002 report by the group TRAFFIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect against autoimmune hepatitis , viral hepatitis , and other liver diseases . The bile agent also appears to improve immunity and prevent colon cancer , TRAFFIC North America notes . <p> Although the compound can be synthesized from other sources , many traditional healers still recommend the bear version , Eastham 's group has found . <p> Prices for bile and gallbladders vary dramatically . Asian smugglers have told U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents that gallbladders can fetch $10,000 apiece . WSPA cites market studies indicating that bile powder can cost as little as 24 cents a gram at bear farms in China but as much to $28 a gram in Taiwan and $250 a gram in Japan , two places where bear bile is illegal . <p> <p> CRUEL AND UNUSUAL International animal-protection groups have taken on the issue of farmed bile because of the heavy price that the bears pay . The Animals Asia Foundation has documented that price among the bears that it has rescued . <p> Most of the animals lack wilderness-survival skills after having spent most or all of their lives in captivity . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs , and severely damaged internal organs . <p> More than 85 percent of rescued bears suffer abdominal adhesions that bind organs to one another and to the abdominal wall , says Kati Loeffler , the veterinarian at the foundation 's sanctuary in Chengdu . Some 10 percent of bears also have liver tumors . <p> Shortly after the animals enter the sanctuary , they have their gallbladders surgically removed . " We do this , " Loeffler explains , " because those gallbladders are just a horrible mess . " Nearly all these have polyps , and many contain old , pus-filled abscesses , which are " an indication of long-term trauma and infection , " she says . <p> These health conditions reflect repeated trauma , such as from nonsterile surgery to insert a catheter or repeatedly piercing the gallbladder to drain bile , Loeffler says . In one such technique , Robinson notes , Chinese farmers stitch the gallbladder to the abdominal wall , pierce it , and then prevent the wound from healing . For each bile extraction , the gallbladder is repunctured  --  sometimes twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , Loeffler says : " Only a bear could handle such trauma . Any other species would have died . " <p> <p> STUNG , TWICE An illegal trade in bears and their parts exists even in the United States . During the past year , federal prosecutions were brought against three hunters in Alaska for killing 10 bears to harvest their gallbladders for sale in Korea . Biologists surveying salmon runs uncovered the kills ( see " Snaring Poachers , " below ) . <p> But the Alaska haul pales in comparison with the 118 gallbladders-now frozen and in federal custody-that were purchased from a single person as part of an earlier sting . The major undercover program-Special Operation to Uncover Poaching ( SOUP ) - investigated illegal trafficking in bear parts in the Mid-Atlantic region . <p> Run cooperatively in the late 1990s by the U.S. Park Service , the Fish and Wildlife Service , and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries , SOUP found that bear parts traded in the region came largely from animals taken in Virginia , where bear hunting is legal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts , these hunters marketed the animals ' gallbladders and paws-a delicacy used in some Asian soups-to a broker in West Virginia , where trade in bear parts was then legal . That broker , in turn , sold the gallbladders and paws to Asian buyers living in the United States . <p> The most satisfying aspect of SOUP , Hundley says , was that " we exposed West Virginia as a laundering haven for bear gallbladders that were acquired illegally elsewhere . " Shortly afterward , in 1999 , West Virginia closed this loophole by outlawing the sale of paws and organs of even legally killed bears . <p> Yet that did n't end the region 's bear poaching , notes Skip Wissinger , a Park Service special agent in the Shenandoah National Park 's Elkton , Va. , office . Using information acquired in SOUP , his team and state officers set up a second , more complicated sting operation . Undercover agents opened a sporting-goods store in Elkton . Under the counter , however , they provided bear parts from road kill , previous busts such as SOUP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For 3 years , each gallbladder sale was recorded on tape . Unlike SOUP , which focused on hunters and wholesalers , this sting-Operation VIPER , for Virginia Interagency Effort to Protect Environmental Resources-targeted consumers . <p> The agents had expected most of the bear parts to be exported . The " surprise , " Wissinger says , was that " well over half of what we sold went to a domestic market " of traditional Chinese- and Korean-medicine distributors , largely along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard . <p> Growing sales to U.S. consumers have created a local black market in bear parts that " appears absolutely insatiable , " Wissinger told Science News . " We just could n't begin to keep up with what we had been asked to supply . " <p> From VIPER , hundreds of felony charges were leveled against some 80 defendants for trafficking in bear parts . In the 40 cases that have been settled in Virginia state courts , all the defendants were found guilty , Wissinger says . The other cases are still wending their way through federal courts , where prosecution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties may be greater . <p> Still , Wissinger adds that he 's certain that his team 's sting did n't end the local black market- " though we might have slowed it some . " <p> <p> TECH SUPPORT Although bear farming in Vietnam has been illegal for years , Eastham notes that the government turned a blind eye to most of these mom-and-pop operations , which have only one or two bears apiece . But this year , WSPA-on behalf of its 500 member societies-brokered a deal with Hanoi officials for Vietnam to enforce its laws . <p> Vietnamese officials will prevent the sale of bile , but will permit farms to keep the bears they now own . The officials plan to implant microchips , whose purchase may be partially subsidized by WSPA , in the shoulders of all bears on farms . <p> Similar to the identification chips implanted in many pet dogs , these chips would give each bear a unique ID number , record when the tag was implanted , and carry the farm 's address . Monitoring agencies could send people around every 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their implanted data . This procedure would prevent the farms from replenishing their stock when a bear died . <p> The government is " being pragmatic " in letting farmers keep their bears for now , Eastham says , since it 's a violation of international law to kill the endangered animals and sanctuaries ca n't spring up overnight to absorb several thousand bears . Moreover , the program should finally end Vietnam 's rampant problem with capture of wild bears for farming , he says , since the monitoring agencies would prosecute anyone harboring bears without a chip . <p> Eastham told Science News that currently , in South Korea , " we 're in negotiations with government officials to see if they wo n't go down the same road as Vietnam . " <p> Last year , Kate Sanders , a herpetologist in Adelaide , Australia , who works with WSPA , came up with the idea for another antipoaching technology . Inspired by snake venom-detection kits , she says , she suggested a tool to enable customs officials and other law-enforcement agents to test for the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Geneticist Rob Ogden of Wildlife DNA Services in Bangor , Wales , is managing the assay 's development . It will employ the dipstick technology typical of pregnancy-test kits . The assay contains antibodies to characteristic proteins found only in bears . These antibodies are attached to a dye . If they contact a bear protein , they will bind and create a telltale blue line . <p> Ogden says , " We hope to have the kits ready for testing by June 2006 . " <p> Yet another WSPA program is fashioning a decidedly low-tech program aimed at stemming demand for bear bile and gallbladders . Susan Sherwin in the group 's Framingham , Mass. , office is working with Eastham to compile a list of plant-based products that some traditional Asian-medicine practitioners prescribe in place of bile . Among the dozens of materials that they 've turned up so far : aloe vera , ash bark , dandelion , and honeysuckle flowers . The alternatives ' activity depends on chemicals other than ursodeoxycholic acid . <p> WSPA is currently surveying traditional-medicine practitioners worldwide about the conditions and circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year , WSPA plans to begin publicizing the results to traditional Asian healers in hopes of encouraging more of them to substitute herbal products for bile . <p> One thing working in his favor , Eastham notes , is that the plant products all " are a lot cheaper than bile .
