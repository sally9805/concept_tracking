. These skis were n't raised on a diet of Coke , Fritos and PlayStation 2 , but they 're still fat as hell . With waists that measure 105 to 142 millimeters  --  and , in some cases , reverse sidecuts and cambers ( la water skis )  --  they 're made for deep , soft snow and almost nothing else . NUMBER OF SKIS TESTED : 11 FINALISTS ( REVIEWED HERE ) : 8 ATOMIC THUG $995 ( without bindings ) ; 140/120/133 POWER 67 FINESSE 33 FLOTATION 3.7 TURN 2.9 STABILITY 3.3 The name says it all : This ski floats , but in a high-speed , hold-on-to-your-jock kind of way . One of the least surfy skis tested  --  it needs to be actively decambered to turn . Penetrates the snowpack when you tip it on edge . GRIPES : Tough to release the tail and slide . PROPS : It 's no thug when it comes to the sweet spot . A stable , forgiving ride  --  despite its bad-boy nature . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The Thug is a straight-running marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 181 , 192 DYNASTAR LEGEND PRO XXL $1,095 ( without bindings ) ; 132/109/122 POWER 57 FINESSE 43 FLOTATION 3.0 TURN 3.2 STABILITY 4.0 Testers raved about the XXL 's blasting power and damp feel . One of the skinnier skis in the test ( at 109 millimeters ! ) , it easily goes from short powder turns in the trees to hang-it-all-out , wide-open smear turns on big faces . GRIPES : Testers wanted more girth . Another 10 millimeters underfoot would only make it better . PROPS : Great damp feel . It locks into big turns . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Skis solid from rail to rail and lets you blow through powder . "  --  Matt Ross LENGTHS ( CM ) : 194 ONLY ELAN M 1111 $1,000 ( without bindings ) ; 161/121/141 POWER 53 FINESSE 47 FLOTATION 3.9 TURN 2.7 STABILITY 3.7 KILLER DEAL Oversize tips and a shorter swallowtail let the M 1111s pop to The surface effortlessly . And despite all this ski 's sidecut ( the most in the category ) it 's predictable in soft snow  --  especially for skiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash out easily . PROPS : Once you figure out the balance point ( hint : it 's not to the back ) , this ski can handle anything . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The ski of choice for big dumps . "  --  Jamie Britt LENGTHS ( CM ) : 184 ONLY GOODE SCOOP $990 ( without bindings ) ; 145/142/139 POWER 32 FINESSE 68 FLOTATION 4.3 TURN 3.0 STABILITY 3.0 In perfect powder , the carbon-fiber Scoop  --  with its 142-millimeter waist and reverse camber and sidecut  --  may be the most easy-skiing board ever created . Not exciting or particularly dynamic , but easy . GRIPES : On hardpack , that reverse sidecut can send you into the splits if you try to set it on edge ; supreme lack of heft makes it sketchy at high speeds . PROPS : Roll your ankles , add virgin powder , and you 're a powder skier . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Now you can slide your turns in powder , too . "  --  Zach Crist LENGTHS ( CM ) : 173 , 183 HEAD SUPER MOJO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINESSE 50 FLOTATION 2.4 TURN 3.3 STABILITY 3.2 The skinniest board of the bunch , it did n't win any flotation awards , but it impressed testers with its quickness , predictability , and stability . Less of a pure powder ski , it would make a great everyday ski at Jackson or Vail . GRIPES : Tips dive easily compared with the fatter skis tested . PROPS : Quick edge-to-edge  --  even when they 're buried six inches deep . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Great choice for the all-mountain ripper . "  --  Jenn Berg LENGTHS ( CM ) : 181 , 191 K2 PONTOON $1,000 ( without bindings ) ; 160/130/120 POWER 30 FINESSE 70 FLOTATION 4.5 TURN 3.8 STABILITY 4.0 SKIING BEST IN TEST The Pontoons ' reverse camber and Frankenstein combination of straight edge from tip to toepiece , sidecut underfoot , and taper at the tail had our testers doubting . Then they skied them . Quick and aggressive powder skiing has never been so effortless . The Best in Test . GRIPES : You 'll survive on hardpack , but it ai n't fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a roll of the ankle you 're turning  --  and no leg burn , ever . TESTER 'S TAKE : " This ski will revolutionize big-mountain skiing . "  --  Zach Crist LENGTHS ( CM ) : 179 , 189 NORDICA SUPERCHARGER BLOWER $775 ( without bindings ) ; 139/110/129 POWER 58 FINESSE 42 FLOTATION 2.8 TURN 2.6 STABILITY 2.9 Getting you instantly onto your balance point is fast becoming a Nordica trademark . So it is with the Blower . Testers cited this ski 's comfort and predictability first , and then raved about dampness and power . GRIPES : Another ski that did well despite its lack of float  --  you ski the Blower through the snow . PROPS : There 's no learning curve : You 're at home as soon as you step in . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The steeper it gets , the better it skis . "  --  Jamie Britt LENGTHS ( CM ) : 185 , 193 VLKL SUMO $1,000 ( without bindings ) ; 150/125/142 POWER 48 FINESSE 52 FLOTATION 4.3 TURN 3.6 STABILITY 3.8 With a 125-millimeter waist ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its namesake . But it does n't ski big . A pure floater , it transitions from turn to turn effortlessly and skims the surface  --  until you punch it in the belly and set it on edge . GRIPES : Some testers felt that the tail was hard to release . PROPS : Hands down , the most versatile ski in the bunch  --  surprisingly fun and aggressive on hard snow , too . TESTER 'S TAKE : " An awesome choice for anyone who loves powder and gets it frequently .
