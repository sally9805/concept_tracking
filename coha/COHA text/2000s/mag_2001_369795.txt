I 'm just a gigolo when it comes to gadget love . I get all excited about cool devices , then dump them in a flash for younger , slimmer , faster models . But I 've never fallen so hard as I did last month when I bought a Sony TiVo , the tapeless video machine that stores up to 30 hours ' worth of TV on its internal hard drive . TiVo delighted me with its ease of use and uncanny intelligence ( smart enough to recommend shows it knows I 'll like ) . I was sure I 'd found a lasting relationship . So when a friend mentioned that Microsoft was working on a rival box called Ultimate TV that could do everything TiVo did plus record two channels at the same time , my heart sank . Was it dumping time again , so soon ? <P> To find out , I spent last week on a kind of technological Temptation Island , quietly playing with Ultimate TV on the bedroom set while TiVo sat in the living room , blissfully unaware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for all its dual-channel flashiness , Ultimate TV ultimately failed to sway me from my first love . <P> Right now , Ultimate TV is only available with DirecTV , which means you have to commit to satellite to use it ( score one for TiVo , which works with cable too ) . Ultimate TV combines receiver and recorder in one box  --  which should , in theory , be better . But for some reason ( possibly all the extra circuitry Microsoft had to pack into it ) my Ultimate TV buzzed and hummed like a mini-fridge , even when powered down . I had to unplug it to get any sleep . So much for all those shows I wanted to record overnight . <P> Ultimate TV 's supposedly universal remote did n't fare much better . It was bulky , sluggish , overly complicated and could n't even be made to turn on my TV . I missed TiVo 's slim little clicker , which recognized the TV semi-automatically . And I really missed its thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons . <P> Pressing thumbs is how TiVo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures out the kind of stuff you like , it records it automatically . With Ultimate TV , you have to wade through the onscreen schedule and manually select each program you want to record  --  unless you choose a " season ticket , " which records a show each time it 's on . The device also warns you immediately about scheduling conflicts and , as with TiVo , makes it insanely easy to zip through the commercials . <P> But that 's about as far as Ultimate TV 's user friendliness goes . Want to mark a show for recording without browsing through the listings ? Ultimate TV makes you enter names on an infrared keyboard , which is even clunkier than the remote . This is part of the package because Microsoft is also trying to sell you Web TV , which still ranks as one of the most painful Internet experiences I 've ever had . <P> To be fair to Ultimate TV , its main advantage  --  two simultaneous channels of everything  --  is a huge one . Last Thursday , for example , it dutifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't watch one while recording the other . If you 're a career couch potato with many such conflicts , you may be able to overlook Ultimate TV 's faults . <P> But if you 're like me , and all you really want is grippingly well-made TV on demand , no recorder loves you back like TiVo . Now if you 'll excuse me , I 've got to make up for my unexplained absence with some serious thumb action .
