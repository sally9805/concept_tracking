I was alone in the courtroom , sitting at counsel 's table with a single slim folder opened before me . I had studied the photograph inside it hundreds of times in my office , but this morning I stared at it again for a different purpose . The overhead shot of Amanda Quillian on a steel gurney had been taken at the morgue , shortly before her autopsy was performed eight months ago . Circular bruises were clustered on her throat , and crescent-shaped abrasions ringed the discolored areas of her skin , outlining the exact place where someone had ended her life by crushing her neck with his hands . " Loneliest seat in town . Prosecutor in a domestic standing up before twelve good men and true  --  plus a few whacky broads mixed in  --  with a wee bit of circumstantial evidence , a snitch with a rap sheet longer than a roll of toilet paper , and no idea who actually squeezed the breath out of the late , lovely Mrs. Quillian . " I looked up at the sound of Mike Chapman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . Is it unlocked already ? " Mike 's smile was readiest at any chance to tease me . He brushed back his dark hair from his broad forehead , even his eyes laughing as he shook his head while reminding me of the uphill struggle that was about to unfold at trial . " No . Artie Tramm let me in . Said to tell you the judge gave him orders to admit the riffraff at nine fifteen . Get rid ofyour coffee and say a little prayer to Our Lady of the Perpetually Hopeless Case . " " It gives me such a warm feeling in my gut when the detective who made the arrest lacks conviction before even one of my witnesses is cross-examined . " " Conviction ? This may be the last time you get to use that word for a while , Coop . " Mike walked toward the well of the courtroom as I stood and took the last slug of cold coffee . " Three cups should do it , " I said , tossing the cardboard container into the trash can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside me . " " You still get ' em ? " " Put me out to pasture if I 'm ever trying a major case and tell you I do n't . " He looked at the blowup of Amanda Quillian 's face . " She talking to you , Coop ? That why you slipped up here at eight thirty ? " I did n't answer . Mike Chapman and I had worked together on homicides for more than a decade , well familiar with each other 's habits . We were professional partners and close friends . Mike knew that yesterday I had asked Artie , the officer in charge of Part 83 of the Supreme Court of New York County , Criminal Division , for permission to come up early to spend an hour in the courtroom before the day 's proceedings began . The large shopping cart that had become the favorite conveyance for prosecutorial case files over the last twenty years was parked behind my chair . It was loaded with Redwelds , part of every litigator 's organizational system , and within them an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue for NYPD cops and detectives , green for medical and forensic experts , and a few yellow ones for the names my adversary had turned over as part of the defendant 's case . The lower rack held the dozens of physical exhibits I planned to introduce into evidence , all of which had been pre-marked for identification to save time during the trial . " Hey , Mike , " Artie Tramm called out as he stepped into the back of the room . " You see the game last night ? The Yankees were hitting like it was a home-run derby . " " Ms. Cooper had me hand-holding witnesses till ten o'clock . I only caught the last inning . Good thing they can hit ' cause the pitching staff is having a problem finding the plate this year . " " You got a crowd growing out there , Alex , " Artie said , pointing in the direction of the door . " I guess that 's why they moved you to this part , so there 's enough staff to control ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? " " I 'm set , Artie . Thanks . " I started to arrange my folders and notepads on the table . " She needs a killer . She needs a stone-cold murderer I can drag in here in handcuffs before she makes her closing argument in three weeks , " Mike said . " Do Coop a favor and keep your eyes open for one . " Artie laughed . " I think you got a few possibilities in the peanut gallery . " The long corridors at 100 Centre Street were bookended with oversize courtrooms , and this case had been assigned to one . The Quillian matter had been high-profile since the victim 's body was found in her town house in the East Eighties , half a block away from the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and the supervising judge had known from the time of the arraignment that the trial would draw spectators . Murder , money , and marital infidelity brought out the curious , who would fill the benches and choose sides to root for like fans at a wrestling match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . They were both good , " Artie said to Mike , twisting the ends of his handlebar mustache with his right hand as he walked to the judge 's bench . His left thumb was hooked on the waist of his blue serge pants , which drooped below his paunch . " Both real good . " Because Mike would testify as a witness , he was not allowed to be in the courtroom for any other parts of the trial . " Scale of one to ten , how would you rate them ? " " Mike , please do n't  --  " " Go about your business , Ms. Cooper . Ignore us . Do n't tell me you did n't read your own reviews in this morning 's papers ? " Mike grinned at me , running his fingers through his shock of black hair . Artie was taking the judge 's water pitcher to be filled . " Trust me . She was a lot better than that columnist said in the Daily News . I mean , it 's not exactly like they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem so strong . I 'd give Alex a nine , but I 'd give her case a three , " Artie said to Mike . Then he seemed to remember that I was also there . " I hope you 're saving some surprises for us . " " And Howell ? " " Ten . A perfect ten . He 's so smooth . I tell you , Mike , I ever get the urge to kill somebody ? Lem Howell 's my mouthpiece . " The door swung closed behind Artie Tramm . " I did n't mean to stir the pot , Coop . " " Artie 's right . " " About our case ? " " About Lem Howell . Did Laura give you the list of calls to make this morning ? " " She was n't in yet when I got to your office . " Mike was dressed in his trademark navy blazer and charcoal gray slacks . His pale blue shirt was unbuttoned at the collar and his rep tie unknotted and casually crisscrossed under the jacket . Both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , five ten without my heels  --  seemed swallowed up by the large , empty courtroom . " It 's on her desk . " I liked the flow of a trial to be seamless . Witnesses were lined up days ahead of time , placed on standby , and asked to juggle busy professional schedules to appear as needed . Most jurors became annoyed when unnecessary delays extended the length of their service . There would be things none of us could control  --  the juror whose subway train gets stuck or whose babysitter does n't show or who claims his cat swallowed a hair ball and has to go to the vet  --  but Mike and my paralegal , Maxine , would monitor the lineup I had organized to keep my presentation tight . " Anything else I  --  " " See you at one . " " Do n't get short with me , kid . I 'm with you on this . You just got to be realistic about our chances . I 'm sorry if I broke your concentration . " " That 's not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quillian 's photograph back in the folder and replaced it on the cart . " So you got up here early to avoid running the gauntlet into the courtroom , you brought all the exhibits with you  --  and I guess you 've made your peace with Amanda . " It was something I did at the beginning of every murder trial , just my own quiet way of getting ready to go into battle . Within the hour , every aspect of this woman 's personal life would be exposed to the jury  --  and to the public . The most intimate details of her daily affairs would be offered up for dissection  --  by me as well as by the defense  --  most of them things she had talked about , if at all , only with people she trusted and loved . As soon as the doors were unlocked , the first two rows behind me , on both sides of the aisle , would be crammed with reporters from each of the city 's newspapers , and the television and radio stations , as well as stringers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reserved for the victim 's family  --  her elderly mother , two sisters , and several of her closest friends . The rest of the audience would be a mix of locals who braved the intense heat of the June day , some who were courthouse regulars who liked the show  --  no matter what the crime  --  and others because cameras are n't allowed in New York State trials , meaning no gavel-to-gavel coverage of the case on Court TV . And , of course , also attending would be the young Legal Aid lawyers and my colleagues from the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office , slipping in between their own calendar calls to study Lem Howell 's style or lend me moral support . I knew my case cold . I knew its weaknesses and more of its strong points than the twelve jurors and four alternates would ever hear . Some of the state 's evidence had been suppressed by the judge in pretrial hearings as inadmissible or potentially prejudicial , and Howell would do his best to limit me even further with every application I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be elicited today . I did n't need this time to do any work . I had used the last half hour to think about Amanda Quillian . Mike was right  --  she had talked to me , over and over , through the various forms of evidence he and I had gathered in the months after her death . I looked at the morgue photograph to remind myself of how eloquently she had told her story , from the outset , by the horrific damage done to her strong , healthy body . I looked at it to remind me of the outrage I had felt when Mike Chapman had first called to ask me to meet him at the medical examiner 's office to see his victim  --  one of three homicides that had occurred in Manhattan on that cool fall afternoon . I looked at it to remind me that I had been invested with the trust of those who 'd loved her to seek some kind of justice for the killer  --  the killers  --  of Amanda Quillian . " Detective Michael Patrick Chapman , Second Grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth  --  so help you God ? " The powerful voice of my adversary boomed from the doorway that one of the court officers had unlocked for him . " Lemuel Howell the Third . My very favorite black panther , " Mike said , swinging open the gate that separated the well of the courtroom from the gallery . His reference described Howell 's lean , elegant frame and his skin color , not his politics . " Alexandra , my friend , good morning . " Lem rested his monogrammed leather briefcase on the floor beside his chair , then stepped over to shake hands with Mike . He reached out his arm to grasp my elbow , leaning over to kiss me on the cheek . Lem had always been a toucher  --  the arm-stroking , back-rubbing , hand-grasping contact kind , all the while locking eyes and willing you to engage with him . " Hi , Lem . " " Looking cool , collected , and with a faint scent of jasmine in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sniff the air near my ear . " Lavender , actually . But thanks . " " You might find this a bit of useful information for your off-duty life , Detective . Coco Chanel believed that women ought to dab perfume on themselves wherever they might like to be kissed , " Lem said , pinching my arm before he let it go . " Then you should be sniffing a little closer to Coop 's ass than her ear , " Mike said , as Lem winked at me  --  tapping his long fingers on my pile of folders before returning to his table . " You 're looking mighty fine yourself , Counselor . Guess it 's that razzle-dazzle moment for the jury . " Lem was as strong on substance as he was on style . He had been one of my first supervisors when I 'd arrived in the office as a rookie prosecutor , before he left for a lucrative partnership in the litigation department of a midtown law firm . Lemuel Howell III had the eloquence of the great black preachers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looks of a leading man in a 1940s noir film  --  his wavy hair pomaded into place , straight back without a part . By the end of voir dire  --  in this matter a four-day exercise weeding through 182 prospective jurors  --  he had most of them ready to eat out of his hand before they 'd heard the first prosecution witness . He opened the brass locks on the briefcase and placed a sheaf of papers on his desk before removing a thick , gold fountain pen from his breast pocket . Then he smoothed the front of his beige suit . " And you , Michael Patrick ? You 've detected , deduced , and done Alexandra 's bidding for the better part of a year , and still no perpetrator ? " " If only your client would loosen up and let me know who he paid to do the kill , maybe I could twist Coop 's arm to cut him a deal . " " He ca n't tell you what he does n't know , can he ? " " Save that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back as Artie Tramm returned with the water pitcher and told us that he was ready to open the doors . " And go easy on her , Mr. Triplicate , you know how Coop hates to lose . " Triplicate was what the courthouse reporters called Lem Howell , not for the Roman numeral III in his name , but for his habit of phrasing his descriptions in threesomes . Yesterday , in his opening remarks , Amanda 's death was " admittedly savage , barbaric , and the cowardly work of a dangerous madman " ; his client was " innocent , falsely accused , and horribly distraught by his wife 's untimely demise " ; and the People 's case was " dreadfully flimsy , paper-thin , a gossamer web of fabrications . " " Both sides ready ? " Artie Tramm asked . I nodded while Lem gave him a firm " Yes , sir . " Tramm opened the door on the far side of the judge 's bench , which led to the small barred holding pen to which Brendan Quillian had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I watched as one of the officers removed Quillian 's handcuffs and walked behind him into the courtroom , to place him next to Howell so jurors would not know he had been incarcerated pending trial . The defendant was dressed in one of his elegant Brioni suits , probably for the first time since the day of his arrest . He was as tall as Mike Chapman but with a beefier build , and his brown hair was showing streaks of gray , despite the fact that he had just turned thirty-five . He fixed on me with an icy look as he crossed behind his table , a glare made all the more sinister by the cast of his right eye . Brendan Quillian had been blinded in that eye by a childhood accident , and I swiveled away from its glassy , dead stare as he squinted at me . " Smart move , " Mike whispered , oblivious to the quick exchange . " Howell 's the perfect lawyer for this case . " Quillian and Howell were animatedly talking to each other . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your middle-class white jurors wo n't want to think Quillian did it  --  do n't understand domestic violence when it happens outside the ghetto . Your upper-class white women will think he 's too handsome to be guilty , and your upper-class white men  --  " " When 's the last time you saw an upper-class white man on a Manhattan jury ? " I asked . " They use every excuse in the book to avoid service . " " And your blacks  --  dammit , I guess everybody in the room  --  will fall under the spell of the silver tongue of Lem Howell . " " I 'm ready to open the doors , Mike , " Artie said . " My money 's on you , kid . Make ' em believe , okay ? " Mike said , slapping the table and heading to the courtroom door . " See you at the break . " He walked out against the flow of incoming traffic , while I seated myself at the table with my back to the benches . The first five reporters made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had firm rules that forbade each of us from talking to the press while a case was pending . Lem Howell , however , would leak like a sieve from now until the moment of the verdict , feeding the media tidbits helpful to his client that the jury would never be allowed to hear . So I sucked it up and sat quietly in place while the officers filled the rows with curious onlookers and tried to keep order in the court . " Put your newspapers under your seats , " Tramm roared at the two hundred spectators . " No reading materials , no food or beverages , no cell phones , no talking among yourselves . " All rise , " Tramm continued , " the Honorable Frederick Gertz presiding . " The door from his robing room opened and the stern-faced Gertz , five foot six , strode into the well and climbed the three steps to his bench . " Good morning , Ms. Cooper , Mr. Howell . " " Good morning , Your Honor , " we both answered . Jonetta Purvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the defense table . " The defendant and his lawyer are present , the assistant district attorney is present . Shall we bring in the jurors , Your Honor ? " " You both ready to go forward ? Any housekeeping to attend to ? " " Ready , " I said . I pushed the indictment aside  --  the written instrument that charged Brendan Quillian with " Murder in the Second Degree and Conspiracy to Commit the Crime of Murder in the Second Degree "  --  and reached for the thick purple folder beneath it . Artie stood by the door next to the judge 's bench and opened it . " Jurors entering . " The group of sixteen  --  the first twelve chosen and four alternates  --  filed in , taking their seats in the two rows closest to my desk . They fidgeted as they settled down , some staring at Quillian and Howell , others focusing on me and the full shopping cart behind me . It was impossible to imagine how jurors had been able to obey the judge 's instructions not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stifled my desire to scan the group to see what reading materials each had brought along . Last evening 's news had led with a summary of the opening-day arguments , and this morning 's New York Post banner  --  dial m for mogul : hubby hires hitman  --  would have been visible on every subway and bus route that carried these folks downtown . I lifted the flap of the folder and squinted at the bright yellow Post-it note stuck to my punch list of questions . It was in Lem 's handwriting , slipped onto the file when he had stepped over to greet me minutes ago . Alex  --  take your best shot . If you remembered half of what I taught you , you would n't be leading off with Kate . Beneath the warning he had scrawled another word : SHOWTIME . Gertz 's eyes swept the courtroom , making sure he had everyone 's attention before he pointed his gavel in my direction . " Call your first witness , Miss Cooper . " My voice caught in my throat as I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People 's case . I did n't need to look over at Lem to let him know he had scored his first hit .
