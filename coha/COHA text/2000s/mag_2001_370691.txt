You might not think people would choose to listen to conversations in a frat house . Yet every afternoon Opie and Anthony spend four hours calling each other gay , drooling over hot moms and barraging women to " whip ' em out . " It 's not even a carefully constructed frat chat : an hour before airtime , six staff members , all guys , sit around watching Jackass , shooting baskets and occasionally surfing news websites . They 're less like people preparing for a radio show than people waiting for a pizza . <P> The office even looks like a frat house . Porno tapes line the bookshelves . Opie 's desk , littered with such research material as Maxim , FHM , Stuff and Seventeen , is flanked by two Britney Spears posters . Anthony 's desk , littered with a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen book , video and T shirt , sits under a poster of the twins . " Look how hot they 're getting . And that 's an old picture , " Anthony says . On further inspection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goer . " <P> The entire country will have a chance to hear what guys talk about when they 're trying really hard to sound like guys . Infinity Broadcasting , the radio arm of Viacom , this month began syndicating The Opie &; Anthony Show , based in New York City , to such cities as Chicago , Dallas and Philadelphia , and will soon have them on about 20 stations . Viacom hopes O &A; can duplicate their ratings success in New York , where they are often No. 1 in their prime demographic  --  men 25 to 49 . Gregg ( Opie ) Hughes ( he looks like Opie from The Andy Griffith Show ) , 36 , and Anthony Cumia , 39 , are the descendants of Howard Stern , replacing his sour trangressiveness with male realpolitik : while Stern interviews strippers , O &A; just want them to take off their clothes . <P> Viacom also syndicates the flagging Stern , who is no fan of O &A.; And vice versa . " He 's been working off the same formula for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoo hoo , " says Opie . " It 's the same midgets , the same pinheads . For today 's society , you have to keep things interesting . " Interesting is n't always tasteful , as when Jay Mohr , the actor , comedian and frequent guest , sang the song Full Blown AIDS , making fun of AIDS patients . <P> But O &A; are often clever , hammering at the outer band of humor that gets laughs from discomfort . Like listening to a gay man perform oral sex on a woman for ' N Sync tickets . Or playing the silent game , where they book bad guests and let them wallow in dead air . They call it cringe radio , at once punk and frat , like Blink-182 or Fred Durst . It 's The Man Show without all that annoying polish . The program has a real garage feeling , with staff members walking in and out of the studio , twisting knobs , grabbing papers . There is no separate producer 's booth : Opie twiddles his own knobs . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em Out Wednesdays , " when women are encouraged to flash guys who have WOW bumper stickers on their cars , or even just the staff of a live Today show , as a listener did last summer . And while Stern has to import porn stars , O &A; have little trouble finding young women to play along . " I think it gives women some power , " Opie explains . When asked what he means by that , he leans his chair back against the conference-room window and says , " That 's a good question . What do I mean by that ? "
