As difficult as it was to sequence the 3.1 billion chemical " letters " that make up human DNA , the harder task may be to figure out what they mean . Trying to determine what 's going on in a particular cell  --  which contains the entire complement of 30,000 or so genes but uses only a small fraction of them  --  is like watching a full-length movie a few pixels at a time . <P> That approach did n't make sense to Stanford biochemist Patrick Brown . Convinced that tissues and cells could be studied as collective systems rather than as individual components , he devised a method to mechanically print more than 20,000 gene molecules onto 45,000 tiny spots on a conventional microscope slide . <P> The result  --  the DNA microarray  --  is one of the most powerful tools in modern biology . Genetic material from the cell being studied is poured over the microarray and incubated in a solution containing fluorescent snippets of the same genes . If a gene is active , a corresponding gene on the microarray glows under UV light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Microarrays , " says Brown , " offer an easy way to see the language the genome uses to send instructions that define every cell in your body . " <P> Brown 's technique proved so effective that it has been adopted by geneticists and drug designers around the world . Brown uses microarrays to compare the genetic script in healthy cells with the script in diseased cells , and he recently discovered that several malignancies assumed to be the result of a specific cancer were actually two or more distinct cancers when viewed on a molecular level . " It was like thinking a stomachache has only one cause , " Brown says . " Recognizing the distinctions makes it possible for us to do a better job of treating these cancers . " <P> The DNA microarray is the latest in a long line of scientific coups for Brown , who was among the first to learn how the AIDS virus replicates within healthy cells . " I 'm just a scientist who 's always daydreaming , " he says , " and any time I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> As a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the late 1970s , he baffled peers by enthusiastically throwing himself into the study of topoisomerases  --  the enzymes whose job it is to twist circular DNA molecules into tight coils . No one knew how the twisting occurred until Brown , playing with a rubber band , realized that by creating a break in the band , curling the opened band into a figure eight , then resealing the loose ends , he could introduce two twists into the rubber band for every split . " Everybody laughed and thought I was crazy , " Brown recalls . But as it turned out , that is exactly how the enzymes operate . The discovery put Brown on the scientific map . <P> Today the only maps he 's interested in are the ones that can guide him through the byways of human DNA . " It 's like exploring unknown territory , " he says . " We 're toddlers just now starting to discover our world . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
