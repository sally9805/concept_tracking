San Francisco 1873 The house on Trevelyan Hill had always beckoned to me . Its stone turrets , stained glass , and gray spires , often swirled with mists from the bay , rose like a dark manor in the clouds . Even today , an unusually bright San Franciscan day , the mysterious air hovering above the house intensified as I drew near . Butterflies fluttered over my nerves , making me pause to stare at the house and dab at the perspiration upon my brow . As a child , in the rare moments when my mother and I escaped our laundering , I 'd beg to go to Holloway Park . There , I 'd sketch the manor 's stark beauty and listen to my mother tell of her privileged life in England . She 'd always drift off to sleep , dreaming of those days , and I 'd make up stories about those who lived on Trevelyan Hill . Such things as drawing and dreams were foreign to my practical nature , as was my penchant for books , but they were my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew from girl to woman  --  the art , the books , and the dreams . They eased my soul , and were my only solace during the toiling days of scalding water , lye soap , and scorching irons . My fantasies of the inhabitants of Trevelyan Hill never matched the rumors about their rich lives.In recent years , tragedy had befallen the Trevelyan family as persistently as the waves of the bay beat against the dark , jagged cliffs visible in the patchy fog behind the manor . The death of their patriarch , rumors of madness , and then the suicide of Benedict Trevelyan 's young wife had marked them . Leastwise , suicide was the official ruling concerning Benedict 's wife 's fall from one of the manor 's turreted towers last year . No one had proven Benedict Trevelyan guilty  --  but there were whispers . Gathering my courage , I forced myself up the manor 's long drive to the perfectly polished mahogany doors . Desperation , or perhaps fate , spurred me . I had decided , and nothing would deter me , least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune to wagging tongues . Closer now , I saw with some surprise that the tall castle-like doors were carved with winged demons chasing after fair , dainty maidens . I 'd expected something stately , like a royal emblem , or a proper design . My curiosity about the inhabitants of the manor grew . My mother had named me Titania after Shakespeare 's Queen of the Fairies . I think she 'd expected I 'd be as beautiful and tiny as she , and not the almost-six-foot plain woman I had become . Somewhere over the years  --  at my insistence  --  my name had been shortened to the more suitable form of Ann . The heat of the afternoon sun must have had a strange effect on me . For as I straightened my dress to walk up the steps of the manor , I suddenly wished to be as attractive as a fairy queen . To be dainty and desirable , even if it meant having to run from demons . Shaking my head , I put my mind back on my task and smoothed the stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilt as I read it again . This was the first time I 'd ever done anything so unseemly . The moment I 'd seen the employment notice in the window of Mr. McGuire 's Bookstore , I had snatched it down , unwilling for anyone else to read it and apply for the position before I could . Benedict Trevelyan was looking for a tutor for his small children , and those interested in the job were to apply in person at his residence . I bolstered myself with a small prayer and a deep breath , feeling my hopes for a different life than that of a laundress lodge in my stomach as I lifted the gargoyle-like brass knocker . A butler wearing a suit and black tie answered . At the sight of me , his polite smile immediately drooped and his nose inched higher . " May I help you ? " My attempts to hide the threadbare state of my gray serge dress with extra starch and ironing had apparently failed , and the heat of the day had wilted the crisply efficient air I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doubts about the wisdom of what I planned to do assailed me , but I pushed them aside , refusing to turn around and run . " Yes ? " the butler prompted . Though he stood on the step above me , he did n't quite reach my height . Instead of looking me in the eye , he focused at some point below my chin . I forced my feet to stay planted and continued to hold my head high . " I am here to see Mr. Trevelyan , please . " " Your name ? " " Miss Ann Lovell . " " Regarding ? " " Employment . " The butler finally raised his gaze to mine . That he had to crick his neck a bit to do it clearly displeased him as much as my appearance . His disapproving frown deepened . " All household cleaning positions have been filled . " He stepped back and started to shut the door . " Please . " I held up the bookstore notice . " I am seeking a teaching position . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man to fill that position . " " Then the position is still available ? " My hopes rose to my throat , nearly choking off my speech . The sound of heavy-booted feet striding closer preceded a deep , polished voice . " Is there a problem , Dobbs ? " The tone and verve of the unknown man 's voice vibrated in the air and ruffled my already quaking insides . The sensation intensified when a towering man appeared at the door behind the butler . I almost stepped back . The man appeared as tall and as broad as the massive doorway itself . His dark hair gleamed in the sunlight like the rich , deep hues of the polished wood behind him . A distinctive brow and Roman nose topped a freshly shaven jaw that could conquer an empire with its determination . He was dressed in dark trousers and a white shirt . His hair lay damp upon his brow as if he 'd just bathed , and he smelled pleasantly of sandalwood . I breathed in , luxuriating in the scent before I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared his throat with a self-righteous flair . " I was just telling the woman that you were looking for a male tutor for Masters Robert and Justin , sir . Not a governess . " Blinking , I attempted to refocus my thoughts . I lifted my gaze . The man had to be Benedict Trevelyan ; his gaze , black as a moonless night in its darkest hours , probed mine . This time I had to crane my neck back , an unusual movement for me . I could easily cast him as one of the winged demons carved on the door . His eyes were so dark a woman would never be able to see through to his soul , and I pitied the poor maiden he would chase . No mercy lurked in his measuring gaze . " And ? " Though he spoke to his servant , the enigmatic master of Trevelyan Hill did n't move his gaze from mine . He pushed the door wider and joined me on the step . I quickly crumpled the notice that I 'd ripped from the bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dress lest he think my hasty action too presumptuous . " She found  --  " " I found the answer unsatisfactory , Mr. Trevelyan . " I spoke with enough force to clearly be heard over Dobbs 's disdain . Then I held my breath , forcing myself to stand strong . There were times when the bounds of propriety had to be breached , and this was such a time . For a brief second , I thought I saw the corners of Benedict Trevelyan 's lips twitch , but his eyes remained so dark and unmoved that I told myself I 'd imagined it . " Interesting . Since he is only reiterating my wishes , I am to take it that it is my words you find unsatisfactory , Miss  --  " " Lovell , " I supplied , offering my right hand in what I knew to be a manly manner . I felt I needed to stand my ground in the face of his challenge . His voice from inside the house had frayed at my confidence ; now the pitch of his deep tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me a bit queasy . I did n't like it . Benedict Trevelyan hesitated , but only a moment , before he gripped and shook my hand . Though I 'd been able to fashion a small hat from odds and ends of materials and netting left over from years past , I did not have the luxury of gloves ; nor did he have any on at the moment . I 'm not sure what he thought about this impropriety , but the shock of his bare hand upon mine struck me like a lightning bolt . Heat traveled through my veins to unmentionable places and coalesced to a burning in my cheeks . I quickly promised myself I would buy a pair of gloves should I receive an employment offer . I instinctively knew it would be necessary for my peace of mind . The man was entirely too disturbing , and I had unprecedented trouble centering my thoughts on the conversation . " Um , they are not necessarily unsatisfactory , Mr. Trevelyan . Unjust would be a more accurate word . A woman can teach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  " He tightened his grip and bowed as if greeting the governor 's wife . My hands were reddened from years of laundering , not a lady 's hands . My voice clogged in my throat , and my thoughts evaporated as his lips , warm and soft , brushed the back of my hand . A fever washed over me , leaving my skin even damper than the humid air had made it . I forcibly snatched back my hand , and this time there was no mistaking the lifting corners of his mouth , but no matching light reached his shadowed eyes . " Unjust ? " he said softly . I suddenly realized Benedict Trevelyan knew exactly what he 'd done to me . Considering our stations in life  --  laundress to rich master of the manor  --  he 'd no social obligation to greet me in such a way . A man as practiced as he had to know the effects his charm had on women , and he 'd smoothly manipulated me into the traditional womanly role I 'd just tried to step away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought . Gathering my practicality and composure , I narrowed my brows , striving to admonish him . My future depended on it . " Completely unjust . Did you even once consider a woman for the position ? " " No , " he said flatly , pulling out his pocket watch . " I have my reasons . " The finality of his tone pricked holes in my confidence , and my hands clenched as the mountain of laundry I saw in the back of my mind grew tenfold , trying to bury me completely . Too many injustices in the world went unaddressed , especially in regards to a woman 's capabilities , and I had to speak up . " Reasons to eliminate candidates without giving just consideration ? " I asked softly . He tensed as I studied him , his stillness similar to that of a predator catching sight of its prey . I made myself meet and hold the intensity of his gaze . I would not let myself feel shame that I had n't excused myself when told a woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my study , " he finally said . I managed to snap my mouth shut before Dobbs repaired the surprised crack in his formal mask . Neither of us had expected Benedict Trevelyan would spend another moment upon a closed issue . I had the distinct impression his decisions were always final . " I will join you there shortly . You 'll have exactly ten minutes to state your credentials and explain why you believe a woman would be a better teacher for my sons . " He turned on his heel and disappeared into the manor . Dobbs stood frozen in place , and for a moment , so did I. I had no official credentials beyond my thirst for knowledge , and my mouth went completely dry over the lie I was about to tell . Regaining his composure , Dobbs stepped aside , motioning me in with an impatient gesture . The look he gave me condemned without a trial . I might as well have been stealing the family silver rather than searching for employment . Even if Benedict Trevelyan laughed in my face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had gotten it . Renewed confidence swelled inside me . I honestly believed in my abilities to teach . Thanks to my mother 's determination , I 'd had many teachers over the years , and thus , personal experience with what methods of instruction worked well . A bittersweet wash of memories splashed over my heart . My education had been as important to my mother as food to eat and air to breathe . It was as if she had known I would be alone as she had been . As I crossed the threshold into the manor , I was surprised to feel small for the first time in my life . Most often I identified with Lewis Carroll 's Alice when she grew too big for the room in which she stood . The ceilings , beam after beam of carved wood , arched to an ornate point above the foyer , like I had seen in drawings of European cathedrals . The marbled floor tiles stretched like a black-and-white sea . Heavy , dark wood chests  --  massive in size  --  sat between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold leaf adorned the fancy wood of the furniture and accented the frames of a multitude of imposing portraits hung on the walls . The faces of the ancestors were stern , as if they judged all who entered and found them lacking . A ramrod suit of armor stood sentry with a sword in his hand , ready to carry out the ancestors ' judgments . The room was the epitome of wealth tastefully displayed . Yet all of its richness paled in comparison to the stained glass windows on opposite ends of the hall . As often as I had studied the house over the years , I 'd never seen the window at the back of the hall . It was twice the size of the front and , in my opinion , the saving grace of Trevelyan Manor , countering its darkness . The combined beauty of the windows was indescribable . I stopped in the entryway , admiring the play of multicolored sunlight dancing over me . I could not help myself . Either I had gotten lost in my astonishment or Dobbs had decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew Benedict Trevelyan stood in front of me with a puzzled frown on his face . " Miss Lovell , my time is limited . Do you wish to speak with me or not ? " " Yes , of course . Please forgive me , but I have never before seen anything so magnificent . " He spun in a circle , his gaze traveling the room . " I suppose the furnishings are impressive . It is not something to which I give much notice . " I shook my head . " No , not the room . " I pointed to the stained glass . " The windows . They are like heaven itself . " Each of the windows depicted a choir of angels singing to a Christ rising through the clouds . As I held out my hand , I realized little spots of color  --  reds , blues , purples , and greens  --  danced over my skin , masking its work-worn redness . " Look , they paint you with their beauty . " My hand truly felt beautiful within the colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped deeper , catching my attention . I 'd forgotten I still held his employment advertisement . He pulled the paper from my fingers . Unable to look him in the eye , I focused on his large hands as he smoothed out the creases . I found myself wondering what strength lay in such powerful hands . He stood silent too long . I could n't bear it . I could n't let a stolen notice rob me of all that I had to offer . I had to say something on my behalf . " Do you not find the facets of light amazing ? " I moved my hand through the colored beams filtering into the hall . " The hues hidden within its waves . Its warmth . Its refractivity . Its beauty . Why , one could spend a lifetime discovering more about its miracles . I have often wondered what it would have been like to be Newton or Huygens . To have made some of the discoveries they did in their scientific studies . " " I think you would have found them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't take kindly to new theories . Not until long after the discoverer is dead . " I met his gaze then and could not look away . He stared at me intently , his eyes unreadable and as dark as a starless night . After an uncomfortable moment , he cleared his throat . " I have a pressing appointment , Miss Lovell , and very little time for musings . Your ten minutes are dwindling . " " Of course . " I followed him into his office . Deep wood tones dominated the decor  --  paneled walls , heavy curtained windows , huge shelves of dark leather-bound books , and a massive mahogany desk . The master of Trevelyan Hill did n't appear to be a lover of light . I found the room as oppressive as a mound of laundry . My relief that he said nothing of the notice I 'd stolen was minimal . The man radiated tension , and I felt it seeping into me . I clenched my jaw and washed my mind with a good dose of practicality . Nerves would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a curt nod of his head , motioned me to a burgundy leather chair facing him . I thankfully perched upon the seat . Tossing the advertisement down on the desk amid the neat stacks of paper , he picked up a writing instrument and slid a pad in front of him . " Why do n't we start with the name of your schooling institution ? " My stomach quivered . I 'd planned to cite my mother 's school in England , but now that the moment to lie had arrived , my mouth had gone numb . I bit down on my tongue , hoping to bring feeling back as I sent another prayer toward heaven . I had more to give than the name of an institution , and it was up to me to make him see that . " Sir , if I may . I have several questions first . " He blinked . Wincing , I pressed on before he could . " If my information is right , your children are young yet ? " He placed the pen back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , folded his arms , and glared at me . The hard set of his jaw told me I was about to be dismissed . Perspiration beaded my lip . Throat dry , I swallowed and clenched my hands in my lap , blessing the inner kernel of determination that bolstered me . I had to stay strong  --  my future depended on it . " Miss Lovell , I do not have time to  --  " " Please , " I said , softly but firmly . " They are five and seven , " he finally said after a long pause . Rather than easing , the tension between us increased . " They are very young and without a mother . Might I inquire as to your reasons for particularly wanting a male tutor during this time as opposed to a governess ? " His lips pressed to a grim line , and I bit my bottom lip hard , already hearing my dismissal . My action drew his attention , and he stared at my mouth . The seconds seemed to grow longer as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical awareness similar to the moment he kissed my hand . The heat of his regard made me much more aware of everything feminine within me , parts of myself I 'd never given the least bit of attention . I slowly released my lip , then curled my toes , welcoming the pinch of my boots . We both seemed to draw a deep breath at the same time . Instead of asking me to leave , he slanted his head to one side and lifted his eyebrow , apparently deciding to humor me . " My boys are high-spirited and unruly . I think they need a firm hand . " " A gentle hand can also be firm . " " That has not been the case with their nurse . " " Because one person does not have a certain skill does n't mean another person is equally lacking . " " True . " His response was slow , as if dragged from him . " Are there more reasons ? " " Dozens . It has been my experience that women have little patience for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to academics . " " True of some women , " I conceded . " But not true of all , especially of me . " To prove my point , I motioned to my starkly plain attire . " So I see , " he said dryly . Though I had invited the criticism , the remark still burned . " Miss Lovell , why do n't you tell me in as few words as possible what you can offer my children over and above a tutor . " I closed my eyes , determined to state my case . " I hope to teach your children what my many teachers taught me . To love learning . To have a thirst for the next book that will take you to a new land . To have a curiosity and desire to press forward to uncover a new fact or invent a new thing . All the humdrum memorization of lessons can never be as valuable as that . " " Well put , but where does discipline fit into all this enthusiasm ? " " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each child must be studied , encouraged , and if need be , admonished at his own level . " I met his gaze steadily . He seemed to mull over my words . The more I gave voice to the feelings and ideas inside me , the stronger I felt . " Tell me , Miss Lovell . Where did you come by this philosophy of education ? " " I learned what I know from my mother , from the many people of varied knowledge to whom she bartered her services as a laundress so that I would be educated . I learned much the same way as Abraham Lincoln did . Anything I want to know , anywhere I want to go , a book can take me . " " And you think this knowledge you have independently acquired would be more beneficial to my children than a man with the accreditation of a learned institution behind him ? " My heart sank at his incredulous tone . " At this point in your children 's development , I most assuredly can offer them something that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called heart , Mr. Trevelyan . " He stood . I stood , knowing that without credentials I had no hope for employment here . Benedict Trevelyan appeared too rigid to consider my unorthodox education . " I thank you for your time , Mr. Trevelyan , and I wish you luck in your search for a proper tutor . " " One more question , Miss Lovell . Your parents ? How do they feel about you seeking employment here ? I am not completely unaware of the whispers behind my back . " " I had a mother only , Mr. Trevelyan . So I am well versed in ignoring whispers . She can not give her opinion . She recently passed away . Good day . " His voice stopped me at the door . " Be here at eight tomorrow morning , Miss Lovell . I will employ you on a trial basis until you 've proven yourself capable . If at any time I find you are not being beneficial to my children 's development , I will find another to replace you . Expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , for I will be evaluating their progress frequently . Your salary will be in keeping with the current rate for teachers here in San Francisco , payable at the end of each month with Saturdays and half-day Sundays off . Room and board are included with the position , as I think having the teacher available to coordinate my children 's development more important than just a few hours a day . I want them to be as well rounded in their education as money can buy . That goes from music to languages as well . If you are not particularly adept at something , then I expect you to hire someone who is , and to participate in that lesson enough to know my child is learning . I have high expectations , Miss Lovell . Have I made myself clear ? " Gratitude flooded my emotions , and I dared not face him . " Perfectly clear , Mr. Trevelyan . " I hurried across the hall , feeling as if I would either laugh or cry at any moment . Dobbs had a haughty look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on to my composure long enough to speak to him before I sailed out of the doorway . " See you tomorrow morning , Mr. Dobbs . You will be a joy to work with . " My voice rang out loudly . An amused snort echoed from the office I had just left , and Dobbs paled to the point that I thought he would faint . Smiling , I stepped out into the sunshine , wondering if I would too . I felt light-headed , as if I was floating in the air . My feet carried me across the street to Holloway Park , to the brightly flowered gardens and sharp scents of marigolds , geraniums , and bluebells . I walked beneath the shady oaks , feeling the soft , springy grass and remembering the past . The birds chirped . The children played . And a light breeze , flavored with the salt and the fish of the bay , trifled with the leaves and then teased the wisps of my hair as it danced by , looking for mischief . The tension wrought so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had n't given me fancy dresses or a pretty face , but she 'd given me something even more valuable . She 'd given me her love . I had always known that . But today I realized that in that love , she 'd given me another precious gift  --  belief in myself , in my worth as a person . " Thank you , " I cried out to the sun , for I knew she watched from heaven , and the warmth of her spirit wrapped around me . Yesterday , after placing wildflowers on my mother 's two-week-old grave , I 'd returned to our small shack to finish that day 's laundry . Yet once there , I 'd found myself unable to clean the mounds of dirty clothes . The bleakness of my future had stared me in the eye . I would have to wash baskets of clothes to feed myself  --  just as I had helped my mother do since I was four . The thought of spending another twenty years the way I had spent the last twenty made me shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My soul cried for a new book to lose my sorrows in , and I turned right around and went to Mr. McGuire 's Bookstore in town . I never made it into the store . For as I stood outside trying to blink away my tears , Benedict Trevelyan 's employment advertisement had come into focus , as had my destiny . I knew at that moment that I would find a way to teach , and I had . Tomorrow I would return to Trevelyan Hill , to the mysterious manor that had called to me for so long . Soon I 'd be able to explore what lay behind its intriguing facade . I turned to study its turrets and spires from afar , and my thoughts strayed again to the master of the manor . Was he capable of murder ? I rubbed my wrist , remembering the feel of his lips upon my skin , remembering the tenor of his voice and his disturbing size . Deep inside me heat tingled , making a little ache flutter to life . I knew that once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forever changed , but there was no going back . My thirst to know more was too strong . I could not deny myself this , no matter what dangers lay ahead . I imagine my yearnings were akin to those that had driven explorers to the sea and pioneers to the West . But , I thought , as I recalled the feel of Benedict Trevelyan 's hand within mine and the touch of his lips , I would definitely buy a pair of gloves . Of that there was no doubt . As the afternoon sun drew closer to the western horizon , painting the sky a swirl of pinks and yellows , I again found myself in front of McGuire 's Bookstore . Walking out to Trevelyan Hill and back into town had left a coating of dust upon me , yet the time I spent at Holloway Park had my spirit feeling renewed , like a flower after a spring rain . Not even the impersonal hustle and bustle of people rushing to the shops , banks , and saloons  --  something that usually made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed , and I yearned to tell someone of its wondrous new direction . I stepped through the door to the tinkling of tiny bells and a squawking " How now , Spirit ! " from Puck the Parrot as he announced my arrival . Mr. McGuire was just as I always found him , perched on a high stool at his desk , engrossed in a book . As always , his desk was a precarious pyramid of novels and papers with only a small corner clear on which to rest the current tome he read . I greeted Puck with a soft coo , brushing his red and green plumes with the back of my hand , then cleared my throat twice before I got Mr. McGuire 's attention . His face broke into a wreath of kind wrinkles when he saw me . " Ah , lass , I 'm so glad you 've come . I 've something for ye . " He stood , absently pushing his bifocals in place on his pebble nose and tucking his few wisps of silver hair back atop his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greediness in my voice should have shamed me , but I fear that when it came to books , I had none . " I go , I go , look how I go ! " Puck , sensing my enthusiasm , answered in kind . The colorful bird quoted Shakespeare , most often the fairy character after which he was named . Mr. McGuire shook his head as if mystified . " How did you ever guess ? " I smiled at the game we had played before and dutifully replied by rote . " I saw it in my crystal ball ? " " Doubtful . " " A bird whispered it in my ear ? " He moved over to Puck , close to where I stood , and gave the parrot half of a hardened biscuit . After a long moment he spoke . " Possibly . " I blinked in surprise . My mother and I had come when we could to McGuire 's Bookstore , using whatever spare monies we had to buy one of the bound treasures from his shelves . And over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose a grandfather , Mr. McGuire , his Scottish burr , and all of his absentminded clutter would be mine . I would never forget the thrill that had gone through my ten-year-old heart the first time he said he had a surprise for me . Always before at this point in our game , when I 'd said a bird whispered in my ear , Mr. McGuire would fuss at Puck for giving away secrets . That Mr. McGuire had changed his response now gave me pause . I did n't know what to say next . Concern deepened his bleary blue eyes . " Your mother 's illness and death has sorrowed me greatly . I 've lived through losing most of those I hold dear , so I know a good bit of how ye have been feeling . I imagine you 've been a mite lonely . " My mother 's death had left a huge void in my life , and this dear old man 's caring put a comforting arm about me . " You always understand . " He sighed . " Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Edinburgh ? Thomas Stewart Traill , to name him . " I nodded my head . " He died back in ' 62 and willed me what he considered his greatest work . He 'd had the honor of editing the Encyclopedia Britannica and gave a copy of the set to me . I want you to have them . " My soul sang at the possibility of having so much knowledge and learning at my fingertips . I did n't know which had flown open wider , my eyes or my mouth . For Mr. McGuire to give me so great a gift told me that he cared for me as deeply as I secretly cared for him . I could not stop the shower of tears that started to fall . Looking confused , Mr. McGuire drew his white brows into high arcs above his bifocals . " Now , I meant to cheer ye . " He patted my back . " You have , " I cried . " But you give too much . I could not possibly accept something so valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lass . I 'm an old man with none but myself to care for , and I have a mind to see knowledge passed into loving hands before I die . " My breath caught , and I studied his wise features through my tears .

He appeared as well as ever , and I released my pent breath to argue . " But  --  " " I 'll not be accepting any buts now . Come and take a wee look at them . " The moment I saw the box of leather-bound wisdom , I knew I was lost . Awe filled me , and tied my tongue as I fingered the gold-leaf lettering upon the spines . These treasures had come straight from Edinburgh , the very birthplace of the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica . I could almost feel the information flow into my fingertips and fever my blood . A plan of instruction slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boys everything in these revered pages .

" A blush rose upon his leathered cheeks , and a merry twinkle lit his watery blue eyes . " Ye can thank me by reading them . " " Oh , I will , I will , a thousand times . I will start this very night , and tomorrow I will stun Mr. Trevelyan with the lessons I have in mind for his sons . " The light of happiness in Mr. McGuire 's eyes turned to alarm .
