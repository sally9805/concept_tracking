Of all the forms of mid-century pop music , the one that has resisted revival most devoutly is folk . Easy to see why : the music was both cheery and pompous , cleaner than Harriet Nelson 's kitchen and nearly as white as the 1963 Masters tournament . In many middle-aged minds , the old folkies linger as a vague adolescent embarrassment  --  the musical equivalent of sophomore zits . <P> So Christopher Guest had to make a film about them . <P> Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show , the two earlier improvised comedies Guest assembled and directed , are about people whose dream of achieving an obscure goal ( putting on a small-town musical , winning a dog show ) far outstrips their sense or competence . In A Mighty Wind , he and co-writer Eugene Levy offer a new blueprint for poignant idiocy : the reunion of three folk groups 40 years after their 15 seconds of fame . <P> All of them  --  the Kingston Trio  --  like Folksmen , the depressingly uplifting " neuftet " New Main Street Singers ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the duo Mitch &; Mickey ( Levy and Catherine O'Hara )  --  persist in believing , as show people must , that they somehow mattered . And still do . " To do ' then ' now is retro , " Folksman Harry Shearer insists . " To do ' then ' then was very now-tro . " <P> This could be an essay in contempt  --  the movie 's title suggests a corrective fart aimed at the ghost of folk pop  --  but what 's the fun in that ? These gifted improv-ers of course locate the ludicrous . ( Lynch does a roguish parody of everything that is creepy and false about show-biz poise . ) But Guest also trusts any actor 's tendency to fall in love with his character  --  and find elaborate rationales for goofy behavior . " There had been abuse in my family , " Higgins solemnly recalls . " But it was mostly musical . " <P> There could be musical abuse in Wind , but again , the creators ca n't leave awful enough alone . They may be playing bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( composed and performed by the cast and collected on a terrific CD ) . Old folkies will spot the genres being guyed . Others will enjoy little frissons , like Guest 's literally sheepish tenor ( he baas his lyrics ) . The rest can just happily hum along . <P> One of the groups is blurbed as " the kind of infectious it 's good to spread around . " The same goes for this film : the sweetest and funniest of Guest 's true-life fake-umentaries.  --  R.C.
