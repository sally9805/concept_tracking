<p> Mayor Daley could find himself falling short of the required majority vote in a crowded February election , forcing him into his first April runoff under the nonpartisan election system that began eight years ago . <p> But despite that potential hurdle , the mayor appears to be in good shape for April , ready to trounce any of his major challengers in a head-to-head matchup . <p> Those are among the key findings of a Chicago Sun-Times/NBC5 Poll on next year 's mayoral contest . <p> ' HE TRIES TO DO WHAT IS BEST ' <p> Despite a brutal year of potentially damaging headlines about allegations of corruption at City Hall , Daley enjoys wide support  --  even though more than two out of five Chicagoans do n't believe him when he says he was unaware of the problems a federal jury found in city hiring . <p> " How could you not be aware of it ? " said Gail Przybek , 67 , a Far Northwest Side retiree who told pollsters she still expects to vote for Daley next year . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cleveland . I can not dislike the mayor for just one thing . <p> " For some reason , you just like some people . And I just think Daley truly loves his job . I think he gives it 110 percent . . . . Underlying everything else , I do think he tries to do what is best for the city . " <p> Next year 's mayoral election is still in the embryonic stages . Daley has taken steps toward seeking re-election but has not officially declared that he will try to extend his 17-year hold on city government . <p> More than half of Chicagoans think he should run again and one out of five think he should not , the poll found . <p> A couple of challengers  --  Circuit Court Clerk Dorothy Brown and former Harold Washington aide William " Dock " Walls  --  have already jumped into the race . Others  --  most notably U.S. Representatives Jesse L. Jackson Jr . and Luis Gutierrez  --  are eyeing a run . And the Rev. James Meeks , a state senator and harsh Daley critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Such a crowded Feb. 27 election could pose problems for Daley , the Sun-Times/NBC5 Poll found . <p> Runoff ahead ? <p> With all those candidates running , Daley wins the initial election in February with 48 percent , Jackson comes in second with 19 percent , Gutierrez gets 10 percent , and the rest all are in the low single digits . <p> But that falls short of the majority vote that would give Daley an outright victory in February , as he enjoyed in 1999  --  against Rep. Bobby Rush  --  and in 2003 against the Rev. Paul Jakes Jr . <p> Under the nonpartisan system that replaced the old primary and general elections , the mayor would then face the next-highest vote-getter in an April 17 runoff . <p> David Axelrod , Daley 's longtime political consultant , discounted that poll finding , saying the likelihood that five opponents will challenge Daley in the primary is small . <p> " This confirms what we already know , which is that the mayor is held in very high regard in the city for his passion and commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said Axelrod . <p> The poll foreshadows a tough road ahead for whichever challenger would survive the February election and get another shot at Daley in April . <p> In one-on-one matchups , the mayor beats Jackson , 59 percent to 23 percent , according to the poll . He trounces Gutierrez , 61 percent to 19 percent . He steamrolls Brown , 65 percent to 12 percent ; Meeks , 63 percent to 12 percent , and Walls , 67 percent to 9 percent . <p> The phone survey was conducted Sept. 10-12 by KRC/Communications Research of Newton , Mass . The random sample of 400 city voters has an error margin of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points , larger when broken down by race , age or other demographic factors . <p> The results should also be viewed with the caveat that Daley benefits from more than two decades of familiarity with voters , while none of his potential challengers has yet had the chance to mount the campaigns that could better introduce them to Chicagoans . <p> ' Dictator ' or unifier ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven out of 10 have a favorable opinion  --  there is a well of discontent out there . <p> " I think he 's a dreadful person . He 's a dictator ; he co-opts and manipulates people into doing his bidding . It 's like , who died and left him king ? " said Janet Treuhaft , 50 , a North Side resident , who told pollsters she would vote for " a dead squirrel " before Daley . " Dead squirrel might be a little harsh . Accurate , but a little harsh . " <p> " I have never once voted for him , " said Treuhaft , an eBay trading assistant . <p> Treuhaft chose Gutierrez as her first choice in the February matchup but said she is really undecided between the Near Northwest Side congressman and Jackson . <p> Treuhaft is in the age range  --  40-64  --  most likely to have unfavorable views of Daley and to say he should not run again , although the group as a whole still overwhelmingly gives him high marks and wants him to seek another term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than 64 . <p> " I 'm a very strong supporter , " said Brian Treglown , a retired auditor who lives in the North Side 's Edgewater neighborhood . " I just think he 's wonderful . He 's kept the city together . The city looks great . Racially , we seem to be at peace . I just think he 's got the city running very well . " <p> CROSSING RACIAL LINES <p> Indeed , the poll highlights how much Daley has been able to avoid the racially polarized voting patterns of the 1980s . Black and white voters have equally positive views of him . <p> In the crowded February matchup , Daley does well among all minority voters . Jackson , who is African American , wins 47 percent of the black vote , but Daley still garners 29 percent . And Daley wins more of the Hispanic vote  --  53 percent  --  than the lone Latino in the race , Gutierrez , who gets 31 percent . <p> Those numbers only change a few percentage points in the head-to-head matchups between Daley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Brown , Meeks and Walls , Daley wins 50 percent or more of the black vote . <p> " I do not think I would take a lot of encouragement from these polls if I were running against him , " Axelrod maintained , dismissing whatever discontent the poll found . <p> " When you are beating everybody by 30 or more points and have an approval rating of 69 points , that shows the respect people have for you , and I am not concerned about anything else . " <p> Again , those numbers reflect both the larger error margin for such breakdowns and the still-forming nature of the others ' campaigns . <p> But the results underscore that the major inroads Daley has made among minority Chicagoans  --  he garnered a majority of the black vote in 2003  --  present a formidable hurdle for any black or Hispanic challenger . <p> " If you look at race , per se , does that mean you 're the right person for the job ? " asked Darryl Ford , 51 , an African American who lives in Chatham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color-blind , but can you honestly say he 's doing a bad job ? You ca n't . " <p> Delmus C. Allen , 57 , a retired phone sales representative from Hyde Park , has voted for Daley from 1989 on but is ready for a change . <p> " He ran something pretty decent for the first 16 years , until this truck scandal came up , " Allen said . " I believe you can not be a head of this city for so long and not know what was going on . Do n't get me wrong , I think he did some good things , but that truck scandal caught up with him . " <p> Allen said he wants to see Jackson as mayor for a variety of reasons , including the Southeast Side congressman 's push for a third airport in the south suburbs . <p> sfornek@suntimes.com <p> THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES/NBC5 POLL <p> On the preference of candidates and city hiring practices in regards to the coming mayoral election , by percentage . <p> On Mayor Daley 's job approval and re-election effort <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable , unfavorable or extremely unfavorable ? <p> Depends on who 's running , too early to decide , etc. 16% <p> Against all the candidates and possible candidates <p> If the candidates in next year 's preliminary election for mayor were ( the following candidates ) and the election were being held tomorrow , for whom would you vote ? <p> THE CANDIDATES AND POSSIBLE CANDIDATES <p> If the candidates in next year 's general election for mayor were Daley and another candidate , and the election were being held tomorrow , for whom would you vote ? <p> ABOUT THIS POLL <p> The Chicago Sun-Times/NBC5 Poll was conducted by KRC/Communications Research of Newton , Mass. , Sept. 10-12 .
