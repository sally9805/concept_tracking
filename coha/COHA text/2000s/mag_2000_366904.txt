I have seen the best-paid minds of my generation urinate . That 's because my editor agreed to send me to the Oscars only if I spent the entire time in the men 's bathroom . That 's because my editor is a mean , bitter woman who has serious jealousy issues about my career and wants to sleep with me . I 'm very good at this revenge thing . <P> But it turns out that staying in the bathroom is no worse than watching the ceremony , which is the least manly way of spending an evening other than crocheting while watching the Miss America Pageant . It 's even worse if you 're seated so far back that you 're five rows in front of Gary Coleman and therefore ca n't make out any onstage cleavage . Plus it was hard being constantly reminded that in terms of pull in the entertainment community , I 've only got five rows on Coleman . My agent already got a call . <P> Anyway , the cool kids hang out by the open bar in the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the bathroom getting high and beating up Army Archerd . Hollywood is just like high school . <P> Unfortunately , just like in high school , no one was talking to me . Which made my stay even more boring , since there was no good primping to watch . The bathroom 's only mirrors were against the urinals , which said more about the entertainment industry than anything that happened on the stage . Without mirrors , people at the sinks had to face one another , which offered some uncomfortable moments . That is , until everyone 's favorite irrepressible foreign madman , Roberto Benigni , looked up to discover a friend across the way . They immediately started doing that fake mime mirror thing . I do n't know how you say " trying too hard " in Italian , but Robin Williams is no doubt going to learn it on his next trip to Italy . <P> After the first hour , it became difficult to find reasons to be in the bathroom . I grew so self-conscious after the first seven minutes at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bladder is as full as the guest list at the Vanity Fair party " and " Katzenberg makes me pee-shy . " <P> At hour three , nursing a Merlot in the far-left stall , I staggered out to see a guy with slicked-back hair tell another guy he hoped he was going to the DreamWorks party because he was " the only fun guy here . " But then some bearded guy attached to Topsy-Turvy leaned in and said , " Hey , I take offense at that . " They ignored him . Topsy-Turvy is the math club of the Oscars . <P> The celebrity everyone wanted to talk to was that guy who found the stolen Oscars in the trash . And as much as I eavesdropped , I could not figure out why he was such a hero . It 's not like he found a case of insulin . Not to get too Jimmy Stewart on him , but if he had n't been at that Dumpster , society would have got by with a Best Cinematography trophy short . <P> And that 's why next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its 6 billionth viewer , or whatever number they claim is slightly higher than the population of the planet . Because I do n't care if my favorite actor does n't win . It 's not as if the guy is n't overloaded with babes and money already . Richard Farnsworth is going to be fine . It just takes him a little longer than most people to get going at the urinal .
