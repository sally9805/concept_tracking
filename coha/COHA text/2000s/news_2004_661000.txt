<p> Jennifer Lind was 18 and the president of her senior class when a little plastic square in a home pregnancy test turned pink , changing her life forever . It confirmed her suspicions that she was pregnant . <p> Goodbye , college plans . Hello , brave new world of teenage motherhood . <p> Officials at her school stripped her of her post as class president on grounds that she was not an appropriate role model . A guidance counselor told her she would never be able to go to college . " I believed him , " recalls Ms. Lind , of Peterborough , N.H. Even her parents turned their backs on her until several months after her son , Jonathan , was born . <p> Yet Lind , like many other young women in her situation , is proving the skeptics and naysayers wrong . She is one of 35 teenage mothers , all of them now adults , who share their trials and triumphs in " You Look Too Young to be a Mom , " a new anthology edited by Deborah Davis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , Ms. Davis hopes to break a longstanding silence and challenge negative stereotypes . <p> In 2002 , 425,000 babies were born to teenage mothers . That represents a 30 percent decline since 1991 - a drop that reflects lower rates for all births . Experts also attribute it to less teenage sex and more contraception . <p> Yet despite greater acceptance in some circles , these young mothers find that the scarlet letter still exists . In their case , the A stands for adolescent pregnancy . <p> " Many young moms comment about the dirty looks they get in supermarkets and on the street , " Ms. Davis says . Their parents are often hurt and angry . Teachers may doubt their chances for success . Even doctors and nurses are sometimes less patient with teens in labor than they are with other women during childbirth , Davis finds . <p> When she solicited essays from teenage mothers across the United States and Canada , she received nearly 200 submissions from girls in all economic backgrounds . A majority were white , mirroring the fact that most teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sent stories . Almost all graduated from high school , and some have gone on to college . <p> No one pretends the journey has been easy . <p> " I went from being a strong , intelligent class president to having nobody around , " Lind says , explaining her initial anger and bitterness eight years ago . She never had a baby shower . That first year after their son was born , her husband even forgot to wish her a happy Mother 's Day . <p> " I realized I needed to take control , " she says . " The only one who could make our situation better was me . I needed to forgive my parents and to get my parents to forgive me . Once I learned to forgive the world for the prejudice against young moms , I was able to say , You know what , I 'm not a bad person . " <p> Today Lind 's son is 8 , and she has a 4-year-old daughter . Divorced , she has held a patchwork of jobs to support her children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress , art model , and landscape gardener . She is also studying for a bachelor 's degree in health science . Lind and her mother now enjoy a close relationship , and she and her father are " a lot closer than we were . " But , she adds , " it 's been a long road to get there . " <p> For Samantha Lucas , the long road began when she was a high school junior . Like other teens expecting babies , she was saddened by her friends ' lack of support . " You say ' pregnant ' when you 're 17 and they gasp , " says Mrs. Lucas , of Easley , S.C . " It 's like you tell someone there 's a fire . After that first second of shock , they 're gone . " <p> With her dreams of going to art school in New York and being a " single independent girl " dashed , Lucas and her boyfriend - now her husband - settled into youthful domesticity with the birth of their daughter . <p> " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in place for me , " she says . Now she and her husband are approaching their seventh wedding anniversary . She works at home as a medical transcriptionist and is attending college part time . <p> Still , despite her success and stability , Lucas sometimes envies her unencumbered contemporaries . " There are days when I 'd just love to hang out with a friend , and not think about buying groceries or paying the mortgage , " she says . " I still wake up and say , Oh my gosh , I ca n't believe I 'm doing this . It 's so hard . " <p> Hard is also the word Jackie Lanni uses to describe her foray into motherhood at 18 . Determined to succeed on her own , she refused to accept welfare or food stamps following the birth of her son . <p> Instead , after attending high school classes every day , she hurried to two part-time jobs . She felt " obligated to do it the hard way , so no one could point an accusing finger at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctance to rely on public assistance , nearly 80 percent of unmarried teen mothers receive welfare at some point , according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy . In 2001 , the monthly cash payment to families receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families averaged $ 288 for one child and $ 362 for two children . <p> " For single mothers in general , you have only two choices - take a handout forever or take a handout for a while , " says Elizabeth Slater of Toronto , whose daughter was born three years ago when she was 19 . " You have to have an education to support a child . " <p> But getting an education means surmounting many obstacles , from a lack of money and time to a lack of student housing for single parents . Katherine Arnoldi of New York , once a teenage mother herself , is writing a book about how the top 300 colleges and universities in the US accommodate single parents . She calls her findings " dismal . " Many schools require freshmen to live on campus but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top schools are the worst offenders , " says Ms. Arnoldi , author of " The Amazing True Story of a Single Teenage Mom . " She finds large state schools to be the best , offering more housing and more day care . Pointing to other bright spots , she lauds the University of California , Davis , for accepting vouchers for federally subsidized housing . And Indiana State University at Bloomington has a sorority for single mothers . <p> Latisha Boyd , who grew up in a housing project in the Bronx , gave birth to a son when she was 19 . For the first six months , she and her baby were homeless , bouncing from one relative 's home to another . Finally , her son 's great-aunt helped her to get an apartment . <p> She began attending church , and her renewed faith helped to turn her life around . Eventually , Ms. Boyd received a master 's degree from Adelphi University . She is a social worker in Maryland . <p> One common thread running through the richly colored tapestry of these women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young mothers as lazy , dependent , and irresponsible . <p> Some mothers receive emotional or financial support from their parents . Others credit mentors and sympathetic employers . Slowly , success has come , one day , one feeding , one diaper change , one paycheck , one college course at a time . In the process , recrimination and doubt gradually give way to growing confidence . <p> Whatever challenges teen parents face , Davis says , their situation does n't have to be a disaster . <p> " Studies show that while young mothers have a hard time in the first years , they do come through it . There 's a limited period of time when things are rough , but most teen mothers and their children turn out fine . " <p> Ms. Lanni , whose son is now 10 , looks forward to graduating from law school at the University of Arizona in December . Summing up the challenge of young parenthood , she says , " Being a teenage mom is like being a woman in corporate America . You have to work twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
