CHAPTER ONE : There 's not much to see around here if you do n't count the view of sparkling turquoise water and ivory sand below buff-colored cliffs where mint-candy-colored houses dangle precariously . Some folks say the spectacular bay view is the reason God gave people eyes . Other folks do n't say much . So unless you 're into tight-lipped people , glorious scenery , candy-colored houses , or our main drawing card , cutesy-touristy restaurants enhanced architecturally by the hulls of old boats attached to their roofs , there 's no reason to be here . The view is what does it for me . On a clear day , and with a clear head , a jog along Splendor Bay beach is reason enough to be living . It 's my coming-of-age panorama , the place where my teenage ghost plays the male lead in the Beach Blanket Bingo adaptation of Splendor in the Grass always running on the drive-in movie screen in my mind 's eye . The view and my ghost are the reasons I 've never been able to grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for too many years , but I do n't plan on ever doing that again . Anyway , the day was one of those crisp , crystalline May days that come just before summer 's heat , a day with a shimmering cornflower-blue sky and not a whiff of the refineries down the coast , a day for feeling young in my little spot of heaven on planet earth . Even the booze ache behind my eyes had eased up enough for me to contemplate a jog on the beach as my workup to a day of pretending I still had my life ahead of me , still had time to get it right if only I 'd give it one more try . There I was , contemplating my woebegone past and my uncertain future , thinking maybe this would be the day I really would give it one more try , when I glanced down from my perch on the deck of Sally Solana 's bayview manor and had an entirely different thought : why the heck is that John Doe near the water 's edge choosing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a black tuxedo with the diamond-studs in his shirt glistening brighter than the mica in the quartz sand , washed up with the seaweed , spoiling my view , interfering with my contemplation of activities physical , right out there on the good stretch of beach where I should have been running . Looking back , I guess it was n't a matter of choice , for the stiff or for me . Things happen . Sometimes you have to ride the wave . I had strolled out to the deck with my first cup of coffee just as the beach patrol discovered the body . That caught my eye . After shrugging their shoulders at each other , they called out Splendor Bay 's finest . The men in tan arrived quickly with the siren blaring . That got my full attention . I finished my second fix of caffeine while watching the activities below through Sally 's opera binoculars . Tiny Sanders , the biggest of our local cops , was stomping around , doing just about every dumb thing imaginable to destroy the integrity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the stiff really was dead . His partner , the newest and youngest member of the three-man Splendor Bay PD , a twenty-one-year-old black kid with the Hispanic name , Gomez , was puking his guts out behind the dune in front of the department 's one and only squad car , a vehicle that I now respected . The Police Caprice , with a 5.7 liter V-8 , could outrun Baby , my sleek ' 57 Corvette rag-top with her original 283-cubic-inch , gas-guzzling , **27;898;TOOLONG engine . I had discovered that sobering fact when Gomez gave me a run for my money , just before I failed his breath-analyzer test , just after I burned up what remained of Baby 's brake shoes trying to stop before I landed in the middle of the bay . When the rescue squad 's elderly Bronco ambulance/coroner 's meat wagon pulled in behind the Caprice , I bet myself that Splendor Bay 's premier crime fighters would get one of the vehicles stuck in the sand before they finished the paperwork on the dead dude . And when they pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I doubled my bet with myself and made the fateful decision to leave the safety of my girlfriend 's cliff-hugging house for a closer look-see . Actually , " girl " is a mild stretch of the facts in Sally Solana 's case . And , I do n't suppose you could call her my friend anymore , either . Just so you know , I do n't normally go poking my nose into crime scenes I 'm not paid to poke my nose into . But this one was different . I do n't normally find death on my doorstep . And , with Sally 's opera glasses , I had counted a dozen glittering diamond studs in the John Doe 's pleated shirt . Since we do n't get many stiffs on this section of beach and the ones we do get do n't usually turn up wearing a tux , that had me extra curious . I wanted to see who he was , something I could n't do from Sally 's deck because his face tilted away from me in his final view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for a photo or two , or a few unofficial facts on a stiff who could afford to die in diamonds . I could definitely use the cash since this month 's Scotch trust-fund allowance had already been spent at Fred 's Fine Liquors , down the boardwalk from Fred 's Fine Seafood Bar and Grill , up the beach from my own humble shack . You never know , I told myself , John Doe might be somebody interesting enough for a grocery store tabloid . Or some rich relative might want to know where he was and/or who or what had done him in , which was part and parcel of my current line of workprivate eyeingwhen the weather was n't suitable for surfing . Besides , I reasoned , if someone who knew something about protecting the evidentiary value of crime scenes , such as me , did n't get down there soon , what few clues there were would be washed away in the next tide . Having concluded the cops could use my help , I pulled a pair of shorts on over my briefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my camera , and casually descended the steep wooden stairs to the beach . Gomez was through puking when I got close enough for it to matter . He had started back around the vehicles toward the dead dude , ready to be a man about it , when I caught up with him . " Who is it , Gomez ? Anybody who anybody would care is dead ? " I asked politely . I believe in being polite , and direct . You never know , sometimes the truth pops out when you confuse people like that . If that does n't work , you can always go to phase twointimidation , or bribery . " What 're you doing here , Fragile Dick ? " Gomez asked , being impolite as heck as he hitched up his pants just like Barney Fife on the old Andy Griffith Show . Fragile Dick had been my handle since third grade . It was the worst thing any of the little guys could think of to do with a last name like Glasscock ; there was n't much you could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my self-respect , and for the women in my life , Fragile Dick was a misnomer . " Just happened to be in the neighborhood , visiting a friend . Guess you could say ex-friend if you want to be meticulous in your terminology . Up there , " I said , pointing to the enormous house where **50;927;TOOLONG graciously allowed me to spend the night . Not that I was in any condition to leave when our friendship ended , mind you . Sally must have been . Able to leave , that is . Because she was n't there when I woke up with the strong belief that a little sun on my face would take away the too-much-whiskey pain behind my eyeballs . So far , I had been half-right . If I squinted with the left eye closed , I did n't hurt as much . I squinted at the kid . " Come , on , Gomez . Who 's the stiff ? Anybody important ? " " Maybe , " Gomez allowed . " Tiny just told the Chief he ought to get his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading back over there when you so rudely interrupted me from my duties to the citizens of our fair town . " " Fair is right , Gomez . Do your superiors know you 're a bigot ? I bet Tiny never said the Chief had a white honky ass . It 's probably a red , pimply ass , anyway . You 're the only guy in town who does n't have sun-bleached hair and all you do is lord it over us white guys . Just because you have a tan to die for . What do you use anyway ? A minus SPF 45 sunscreen ? " " Why ? You want to be beautiful like me , Fragile Dick ? " " Definitely . Why do you think I spend so much time in the sun ? I 've seen the way girls turn their head when you drive around in the cruiser . " " I 'll need some official identification before I let you near my crime scene , " Gomez said , a bit chattier now that I had acknowledged his superior swordsmanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license for good cause since the last time I saw you ? And I 'd like to inventory the guy 's pockets before you get within ten feet of him . Routine procedure . Remember ? " " Come on , Gomez , just one teeny , tiny favor , " I whined , " and I 'll let you keep the diamond studs . " Gomez did n't answer . At that moment , we heard the squawk of the Police Caprice radio . Tiny Sanders , the other cop , was communicating with the world at large , the Chief in particular . " Yeah , done that , " Tiny shouted over the surf 's roar . " Have a tentative ID on the floater . Driver 's license says he 's Wallace Moreno . Had five hundred in cash in a money clip , so he was n't robbed . I 'd say you 'd better get ready to vote for a new governor , Chief . The current one is a little under the weather . " I have to admit , when I heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought wasOh , what a beautiful morning ! In my mind 's eye my teenage ghost did a quick Swan Lake up and down the beach . The slimy bastard was dead . Joy ! Joy ! In addition to being the late Governor Moreno of our great state , he was the same self-serving cur who had aided and abetted my beautiful and soon-to-be-ex-wife in the fine , old practice of cuckoldry , or cheating , as in " Your Cheating Heart , " if you prefer Hank Williams to William Shakespeare , as most folks do . My prayers had been answered . For reasons as yet known only to God , instead of enjoying my wife , the governor was now enjoying the state of final repose I had wished upon him . My third thought wasDarn ! I bet they 'll think I did it . I was right . It did n't take long for the cops to give my third thought serious consideration . By then , I had more acute concerns .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
