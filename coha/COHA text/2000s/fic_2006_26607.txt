As soon as we rounded the corner I realized it was a mistake to crash , but by then it was too late to stop . A lot of the Beautiful People were at the party , even on the front lawn . Clearly not our crowd . Zandra , Tru , and I squeezed past the couple on the front porch , pretending not to notice who it was : Carson Gold , the hottest senior guy , shaking his head at a gorgeous girl who was trying not to cry . I rolled my eyes at Zandra after we were clear . " Another one down , " I whispered . She laughed and shoved me forward . I stumbled over the threshold , into the party . We shouldered our way through the crowd , pretending we were looking for someone . As we were passing a couch in the living room , a couple who 'd been making out on it stood up and rushed away , apparently in search of a room . Zandra , Tru , and I plopped down instantly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wedged in pretty tight , with Tru 's skinny thigh in its short skirt pressed against the hip of the oblivious girl beside her , but we smiled at one another triumphantly : We had scored seats . We sat back , pulled off our mittens , unzipped our jackets , and looked around . Parties are our favorite spectatorsport . Not much was going on . We shifted positions and kept scoping . " So , " Tru started . " What would you say is the single most important thing ? " " In life ? " I asked . " No contest . Chocolate . " " Books , " Tru countered . " True love , " Zandra said . " Do you think Emelina is here ? " " No way , " Tru said . " She never goes to parties where Carson will be . " " Ugh , " I groaned . " This is why I vote for chocolate . It 's yours , it 's wonderful , you gobble it up , it 's gone . Good-bye . Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hang around at parties you want to go to . You know ? " Their obsession with Carson Gold was beyond me . I mean , sure , he 's gorgeous , in a generic all-American way . And even I watched sometimes last year when he and Emelina Lee glided through the halls , holding hands . They whispered to each other in corners and kissed in the stairwells . But then Emelina got accepted to Princeton early and when she went to visit for the special weekend , she fell in love with a college boy . She dumped Carson that Monday morning in the school parking lot . Nobody could believe it , least of all Carson . The rumor shot around that he had almost punched her , but at the last second punched his new car instead . Zandra and Tru dragged me out to the parking lot during lunch later that week in search of his white Mazda , to check . Sure enough , there it was , a dent right on the roof near the passenger door : proof . My two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What can I say ? I 'm a pacifist . Punching your own car seems pretty stupid to me . " Think he was dumping that girl on the steps ? " Tru asked . " Clearly , " said Zandra . " He 's still in love with Emelina , everybody knows it . " Tru nodded solemnly . " Gag , " I said . " You do n't understand romance , Josie , " Tru said . She 's been studying . She 's read forty-seven romance novels , as research . Tru skipped first grade so she 's a year younger than me and Zandra , and she looks about ten , especially with her braces and wire-rimmed glasses . She is trying to be less of a bookworm this winter , but I think her pursuit of romance is stressing her out way more than advanced calculus ever has . We like her just fine as she is , all serious and sincere and intense . But it 's hard to convince her to stop trying to be less herself ; she 's on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I pointed out . " Just because he 's hooked up with half the senior girls does n't mean his heart has healed , " whispered Zandra . " Sometimes sluttiness is a sign of intense longing . " " Yeah ? " I asked her . " Trying out a new rationalization . What do you think ? " " Pretty good , " I said . Zandra is the opposite of Tru in a lot of ways  --  she 's curvy where Tru is tiny , outrageous where Tru is timid . Zandra 's hair has not been its natural color since elementary school , she 's more street smart than academic , she has seven piercings , and as for experience with guys , well , Zandra has made out with a lot of guys , but never has had a boyfriend . As tough as she looks , what she really wants is to fall in love . " Think about the way he used to look at her , " Zandra whispered to Tru . " Have you ever seen anything so romantic ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  as if he wanted to swallow her down whole . " " Ew , " I said , sitting up behind them . " Like an oyster ? " Tru and Zandra clutched my arms as Carson Gold himself stalked into the room and stopped right in front of us . Sunk into the couch , our heads came up to about his hip . The girl from the porch flung herself at him , her arms grabbing him from behind . " But I love you , Carson ! " she pleaded . " I thought you loved me ! " What a nightmare . We sunk deeper into the back cushions to watch . " Do n't do this , " he murmured , gently disentangling himself from her tentacle-arms . " Carson ! " " Shh . " He looked at her with soft pity , not like he wanted to swallow her whole . Her hands went to her hair and she pulled , squeezing her eyes tight . A groan escaped from deep in her throat . I was so embarrassed for her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my bag , for something to look at , and text messaged my friend Michael : BP 's SELF-DESTRUCTING HERE . YOU ? The girl plowed through the crowd like a guided missile toward the door , and I heard Carson Gold exhale above us . I kept my eyes on my phone , as my friends stiffened on either side of me . I was trying to work up some pity for the poor girl . I could n't . I mean , she knew who she was dealing with , right ? So why make a jerk of yourself over him ? Or over any boy ? Was he supposed to act like he was married to her just because they 'd fooled around once or twice ? Please , we 're in high school . Hook up and move on . Zandra and Tru both suddenly squeezed my arms tighter . " What ? " " He looked at you , " Zandra whispered fiercely . " Sure . " Michael texted me back : FRIENDS CRAPS TACOS HERE . COME . " He totally did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Lucky me , " I said . " You guys want to go to Michael 's instead ? " " Are they playing craps ? " Tru asked . When I nodded , she grinned . Tru 's a champ at shooting craps , we recently discovered . She says it all boils down to figuring out what 's most likely to happen , and something about how many ways there are to make eight . We hoisted ourselves off the couch . " I 'll call my dad , " Tru offered , rummaging through her bag for her cell as we headed toward the door . " He 'll be psyched . He got me a new book on probability this week . " On the way to the door we passed this guy Andrew , a junior I had hooked up with a while ago . He and I checked each other out , considering a rematch . " Josie , " Tru called from the door . " Come on ! " I shrugged at Andrew and spun around , right into Carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right back at you , " I answered . I went around him and caught up with my crazy friends , who spent the whole ride over to Michael 's deconstructing the multiple possible meanings of " Ow " and envying my encounter with the great Carson Gold . Luckily , once we got to Michael 's we started rolling dice , which moved us on to more interesting subjects like whether or not luck actually exists . Continues ...
