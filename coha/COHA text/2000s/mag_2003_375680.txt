Any of the various U.S. military units stationed in Iraq would be thrilled to be part of the hunt for Saddam . And they could be at any time , should intelligence point to his presence in areas they patrol . The two outfits that have most aggressively pursued Saddam in recent weeks are the 4th Infantry Division 's RAIDER BRIGADE , which controls Tikrit and the surrounding towns , and the 101st Airborne Division 's STRIKE BRIGADE , in charge of Mosul and environs . However , the vanguard unit seeking Saddam is the elite TASK FORCE 20 , whose exclusive job is to hunt for Iraq 's most wanted . TF20 , as it is called within the military , is a shadowy group that avoids the press . Military spokesmen in Iraq have no authority to comment on the unit or its activities . It is built around the Delta Force , the military 's storied special-operations force , and bolstered with commandos from other services , aviation units detached from the army , and paramilitary teams on loan from the CIA . Spotted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look : scruffy beards , unkempt hair , distinct black body armor and tiny walkie-talkies.  --  By Michael Ware and Brian Bennett/Tikrit
