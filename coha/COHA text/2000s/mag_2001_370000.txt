With her ruddy skin , pulpy bosom and self-abasing zinger wit , she 's so  --  well , so very English . One glance at Houston 's own Renee Zellweger , and all anxiety about the casting of an American as Britain 's favorite wounded bird of the ' 90s vanishes . ( Hey , if Vivien Leigh could play Scarlett O'Hara ... ) She fits in , and stands out , perfectly . And as the plot of Bridget Jones 's Diary ripens , and two handsome men  --  rapacious Daniel Cleaver ( Hugh Grant ) and dull Mark Darcy ( Colin Firth )  --  tumble vagrantly into her heart , Zellweger reveals , as in a soul 's striptease , Bridget 's appeal . Inside this " verbally incontinent spinster " ( as Darcy calls her ) , a brilliant vamp is aching to be set free . <P> The diary form , established by Helen Fielding in an Independent column and then two blithe best sellers , is smartly adapted in the script by Fielding , Andrew Davies ( BBC 's Pride and Prejudice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtual conglomerate of middle-class Brit humor . It gives good lines and cunning motives to the stars , especially the newly gaunt Grant , who 's irresistible as a randy cad . And , except for a catastrophic third act that comprises about 14 endings , two transatlantic flights and a long , clumsy fight scene , director Sharon Maguire nicely juggles the slapstick and heartbreak . <P> For this is a very romantic romantic comedy . That Firth , who was the dark dreamboat Darcy in Pride and Prejudice , plays dull dreamboat Darcy here simply underlines the comedy-of-manners connection between Helen Fielding 's work and Jane Austen 's . This , for the most part , is a tale of comic good sense and poignant sensibility . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
