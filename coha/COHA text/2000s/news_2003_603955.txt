<p> For Columbia , Mo. , rheumatologist and internist Sara Walker , the last straw was a super-sized Coke : The angry patient aimed it at her , and even though it hit the wall , " we had to expel him from the clinic , " she says . <p> Los Angeles psychiatrist Marc Graff says he does n't release every patient who hits him ( it has happened several times ) , but he has dismissed a few who have threatened his life , plus several who have " improved " their prescriptions to add a few hundred extra pills . <p> For Walker , who is president of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine , the decision to sever ties with a patient was a once-in-a-career incident ; for Graff , a spokesman for the American Psychiatric Association , it happens once or twice a year . <p> But physicians around the country say it 's something every one of them faces sooner or later : a patient so abusive , non-compliant , dishonest or otherwise troublesome that the doctor simply has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No one knows how often it happens ; like everything else within the doctor/patient relationship , a painful breakup usually is a private matter . But in an age when many consumers choose their physicians with extreme care  --  and replace them at will  --  it is important to know that doctors have choices , too . <p> " It really is a two-way street , " says Richard Roberts , a family physician in Belleville , Wis. , who teaches at the University of Wisconsin . " Sometimes it 's easy for people to forget that . " <p> In general , physicians have a legal and ethical duty to help any patient in an emergency and not to neglect or abandon patients in peril . But the ethics code of the American Medical Association says doctors can sever patient ties for a variety of reasons , as long as patients , responsible relatives or guardians are given enough notice to find another doctor . <p> The code says typical steps a doctor might take include putting the notice in writing , agreeing to provide care for some limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . <p> The ethics code of Walker 's group adds that dismissing a patient " is a serious event , especially if the patient is acutely ill , and should be undertaken only after genuine attempts are made to understand and resolve differences . " <p> James Seiler , a family physician from Dayton , Ohio , says that 's just what he did in the case of a belligerent elderly man . " He was making racist comments about one of the staffers out in the waiting room , " Seiler says . " We could n't change his beliefs . . . but we told him it was bothersome to other people out in the waiting room , and we gave him several warnings . When the behavior persisted , we said , ' We 're sorry , but we ca n't continue to see you . ' " <p> Seiler 's staff worked with the man 's daughter to find him another doctor . <p> Seiler says the decision was trickier in one unusual case he recently wrote about in the journal Medical Economics . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto accident complained that a file clerk in his office , a cousin of the patient 's fiance , had violated her privacy . Specifically , the patient claimed the clerk had told the fiance 's sister that the patient was pregnant and taking antidepressants . <p> " It was a real soap opera , " Seiler says . He was set to fire the clerk and face a lawsuit from the patient . But a phone call from his office manager to the fiance 's sister unraveled the truth : The patient had made up the whole story to cause problems among her future relatives ; the clerk had not divulged a thing . <p> The clerk kept her job , the patient lost her doctor and a lawsuit never materialized , Seiler says . <p> Of course , patients do sometimes sue their doctors . And doctors frequently ask such patients to seek care elsewhere  --  sometimes to the patient 's surprise . <p> " I 've had several people who 've called and wanted to continue to see us , " despite having filed malpractice suits , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physicians . Fleming , who practices in Shreveport , La. , says that in one case he did allow a woman to return . She said lawyers suing a drugmaker on her behalf had sued the doctor , too , without her knowledge . <p> Probably the most common reason that doctors dismiss patients is chronic non-payment of bills , says family doctor Roberts , who is also trained as a lawyer . Typically , he says , doctors send patients several letters asking for payments or explanations before letting the ax fall . Roberts says he also calls patients and asks whether he or his staff can help . Occasionally , he says , he learns that the problem is n't financial at all . <p> " Sometimes , patients are upset about something . They 'll say that the receptionist was rude or the nurse was rough when she gave them an injection . " Usually , he says , he can do something to save the relationship . <p> Patients caught deceiving their doctors to obtain drugs , often getting prescriptions from several doctors and pharmacies , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be legally culpable if they continue to provide drugs to a patient and they have evidence that there is drug-seeking behavior and drugs are being used inappropriately , " says David Fleming , an internist in Columbia , Mo. , and director of the University of Missouri Center for Health Ethics . <p> Some doctors try to reform such patients . But Michael Fleming , the Louisiana doctor , says that never works for him : He always dismisses a patient caught " drug shopping . " <p> " It happens quite frequently , unfortunately , " he says . <p> Much less common , but sometimes painfully necessary , some doctors say , is dismissing patients who simply will not follow an agreed-upon treatment plan , endangering not only their health but putting their doctors in legal peril . <p> " Let 's say you have a diabetic patient who wo n't follow dietary restrictions , who wo n't take medication , " Michael Fleming says . " That patient could have a complication and then claim the doctor was responsible for not giving appropriate treatment . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk with the patient and say , ' I 'm doing everything I can to take care of you , but you have to take some responsibility yourself . ' " And , occasionally , he says , he does dismiss such patients . <p> Missouri 's David Fleming says he never dismisses a patient for non-compliance alone . " I just think when patients are non-compliant , we should work harder . They need us more than ever . " Doctors , he says , can protect themselves legally by keeping records of the patient 's behavior . <p> However , if non-compliance is combined with poor communication , mistrust or a severe clash of personalities , that 's another matter . In that case , he says , the sour relationship is working against the patient 's best interests . " I 'll say , ' It 's better that we do n't continue here . I 'll give you a month to find another physician and respond if you call , but after that you 'll have to get your care elsewhere . ' " <p> Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that really tore me up . " A young mother with liver disease caused by drug and alcohol abuse had agreed to  --  and continually failed to follow  --  a plan to control her addictions and monitor her health . But Roberts kept working with her . <p> One day , he told her he needed to draw blood to check her liver enzymes . While he was searching for a lab slip , she walked out of the clinic . Roberts gave up and arranged for her to see another doctor . Two years later , when she was dying at age 37 , " she sent a card expressing thanks for time and energy I 'd invested in her . " <p> Graff , the Los Angeles psychiatrist , says no doctor is happy about letting go of patients . " It 's one of those things in medicine that makes everybody squirm . " It is also potentially treacherous , he says . " I always start by calling lawyers and making sure I 'm doing it the right way . " <p> Michael Fleming says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is completely against what we went into medicine for . " <p> But Walker says patients should keep in mind that it can happen . " You do n't want to ruin a relationship that can save your life , " she says . " That relationship is golden . " <p> Avoid doctor/patient sore points <p> Yes , your doctor can fire you . But the heave-ho is unlikely to come without warning or without a severe breakdown in the doctor/patient relationship . <p> If you never want to be on the receiving end of a " Dear Patient " letter , doctors advise : <p> * Be honest . It is especially important to tell the truth about any other medical care you receive and , especially , any prescriptions you get from other providers . " If the doctor is not able to trust the patient , if you 're not getting the right information , you 're ill-advised to treat them because you are really shooting from the hip , " says Richard Roberts , a family physician in Belleville , Wis . <p> * Be nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry patients from time to time . But remember , medical professionals are human and have their limits . Also , keep in mind that some doctors are quicker to dismiss a patient for mistreating staff members than for mistreating themselves . " If you 're just a hothead , fine , I 'll see you , " says Los Angeles psychiatrist Marc Graff . " But if my secretary is afraid of someone , that 's not OK . " <p> * Pay your bills . If for some reason you ca n't pay right away , talk to the doctor or the office staff about how to handle the situation .
