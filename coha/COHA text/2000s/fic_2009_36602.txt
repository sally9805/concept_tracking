Be careful what you wish for . <br> These six little seeds of warning were long ago generously planted and watered in my unconscious by the inimitable Melanie Mandelbaum , a fifty-eight-year-old executive buyer for Bergdorf 's , affectionately known to my father and to me , her daughter , as the buzzkiller of Long Island . <br> My friend Katrina once described my mother as Oprah in a size 4 , only white . . . and Jewish . She pretty much nailed her . The woman is a nonstopping , ever-talking , advice-giving force of nature who has always insisted on having a hand in everything . <br> According to Dr. Seymour Unterman , Madison Avenue proctologist to the rich and irregular , her chronic state of constipation is a result of a life lived over the speed limit . As with my friends ' mothers , I had discovered that , along with all of the considerable good it has certainly accomplished , this " need for speed " is apparently one of the side effects of the women 's lib movement . <br> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , do it all , accomplish it all , which , we daughters have come to discover , means moms who played at paying attention while distracted with more pressing concerns like jobs , arranging childless evenings in the city , and noting who was getting appointed to what prestigious committee . They were the ones who went back to their careers as soon as they 'd pushed out their babies , running like lab rats on cocaine  --  mothers who spilled the contents of takeout onto paper plates and offered it up as a home-cooked meal . <br> These guilt-riddled women were forced to navigate their nonstop , strive-for-everything , yes , damn it , I can have it all because Gloria Steinem told me so lives by tossing back wee fistfuls of Xanax and almost single-handedly turning therapy in America into a boom profession as a consequence of not , in fact , actually gotten it all . <br> This was my mother . <br> As a kid I remember her bathroom being equipped with a Rolodex , a three-line phone , and a large bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time simply doing your business ; you had to actually do business . She 'd swoop in for dinner or pop into my room at homework time only to disappear seconds later on a phone call or to race off to a meeting in the city , leaving my dad to see to the more mundane childhood endeavors , such as building a dud-free volcano for the fifth-grade science fair or composing a haiku about baby spiders . <br> Would she ever simply sit and watch me do whatever it was daughters do , maybe even kvell , as Bubbe would say ? Fuggedabouddit . Not even with an act of Congress , four Ambien , and a liter of scotch . <br> On the day of my bat mitzvah , she was constantly up and busy  --  checking on the food , retouching her makeup , conferring with the rabbi about some VIP who 'd just arrived and would be requiring recognition . He and my dad , the superhumanly patient Morty Mandelbaum , had to all but hold her down during my actual solo . <br> Do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this because she 'd say those exact words after inevitably doing things her way . Like the time she 'd signed me up for the Mommy and Me classes , only sending me with our nanny so , you know , it was really Nanny and Me , which , of course , my mom spun proudly by pointing out that she loved me and , unlike the other girls , I was picking up some Spanish . <br> And this senior Bergdorf buyer who 'd failed to receive the bump to management she felt she 'd long deserved , whose wildly successful money-raising , temple sisterhood events had for years been the envy of religious institutions all over Long Island , this Energizer bunny with the newly tightened ass , could always be counted on to drop her awesome little minimantra  --  Be Careful What You Wish For  --  at the most inopportune moments . <br> Like the time you 'd fallen during the tap-dance recital , splitting your costume before God and the collective families of the Little Princess Dance Academy of West Hempstead . <br> " You wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing off what was left of your tights . " Be careful what you wish for , Madison , and you 'll never be embarrassed or disappointed . " <br> Or when you were eleven , trying to become the " teacher 's pet " by actually taking care of the teacher 's pet , a six-foot python you had volunteered to house during winter vacation that was last seen slinking down your parents ' toilet bowl from where it presumably ended up swimming with the fishes somewhere out in Long Island Sound . <br> " You wanted to be the teacher 's pet ? Welcome to the doghouse . Do n't I always say . . . " <br> And there it was , good old Be Careful What You Wish For . Like hot sun on a child 's ice-cream cone . <br> But then the world changed in ways my mother was unprepared for . <br> Like when we got a lesson in sex education from the president and his intern that suddenly made politics really interesting . Or when Britney kissed Madonna live on television . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing to wrap me in her protective embrace while my mother sat , arms around herself , staring at the screen , alone . From IMs to iPods to iMacs  --  which my mother refused to learn to navigate  --  to her shock and awe when her champion Hillary lost to Barack , the world for her was becoming increasingly incomprehensible . <br> And then came my sin of managing to graduate Wellesley magna cum laude without her having to pull any strings , receiving a master 's in art history that she was fond of pointing out was of dubious worth in today 's information-driven economy , a marketplace that required targeting a specialty , not generalizing and thinking it would get you somewhere . <br> Indeed , through the years of my life , her warnings of the perils of dreaming too big or reaching too far have been as constant as a daughter 's desire to please . But somehow , with two best friends working on my confidence file , with breasts too small and baby fat on my hips that refused diets and the gym , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you wish for makes about as much sense as enrolling your daughter in Girl Scouts to get a deal on the cookies . ( Have you met my mother ? ) <br> And now at the lived a little but just you wait age of twenty-eight , I am taking this moment to officially declare my candidacy for independence and here announce that I have forever deleted the glass- half-empty sentiment of Be Careful What You Wish For from my hard drive . <br> I am here to shout to the world , amid church bells and the sound of a thousand shofars , that wishes do come true . <br> My proof ? Simply that in one week from tonight I , Madison Leah Mandelbaum , am set to marry the awesomely sweet , astoundingly smart , phenomenally hot Colin Wordsworth Darcy , he of the dazzling dark eyes and perfectly Episcopalian chiseled chin , the son of Diana Steinberg Darcy of Fifth Avenue-opposite-the-Met ( a totally secular Jew but a Jew nevertheless , rendering Colin kosher in the eyes of the Talmud and JDate ) and Sir Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe , whose distant cousinhood to the Queen nevertheless has conferred on him what Bubbe likes to call a certain royal yichus ) . <br> Now , one week before the event , alone in my Village apartment , working diligently on my vows , trading e-mails with my mother who was maddeningly tweaking the seating chart for the umpteenth time , those six little words of hers have been noodling my brain , trying to get an invitation to the big event . <br> Be Careful What You Wish For . <br> Get lost , I order , banishing them from my enchanted world . <br> Never for a second entertaining the possibility that in less than twenty-four hours . . . they would be back to stay . <br> 2 <br> To get a bead on Colin Darcy and me , you had to start with Hugh , <br> and I do n't mean his father who goes by that name . I refer to that other Brit with the last name of Grant , with whom I 'd fallen in love at thirteen , having seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of my life . <br> I had driven my parents into submission , insisting the actor had to be invited to my bat mitzvah or my life would be over . After much breath holding and threats of boycotting my own affair , they finally agreed . Soon after , an RSVP arrived claiming Hugh Grant was " regrettably busy shooting a film in London " on the particular weekend in question and lamentably had to decline the invitation . At the bottom of the neatly handwritten note was a postscript in which the actor expressed his certainty that I would be " particularly dazzling " on the occasion . <br> From the beaming face of my dad , the irrepressible teddy bear and supersuccessful CPA Morty Mandelbaum , I slowly deduced that Hugh had received some help with his response . <br> Shoot fifteen years into the future to April 15 of last year  --  fourteen months ago . I was with my two best friends on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum . ( " Best friends " does n't cover it . They 're the sisters I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but also due to the fact that since her teens she 'd been almost ludicrously possessed of this impressive little six- pack ) was a Toobin of the Broadway Toobins . Her father and uncle produced last year 's best musical and , when we were sixteen , got us into the opening of Rent when you could n't touch tickets for less than the cost of her mother 's facelift . We 'd been inseparable since age three . We 'd met Kat in third grade and almost immediately became a trio of BFFs . Kat , the magnificently practical Katrina Fitzsimmons , daughter to the Park Avenue disaster of Jeffrey and Tabby Fitzsimmons , had developed her shoot- <br> from-the-lip style organically . It had been her particular " blessing " to spend her childhood and teen years in alternating side-by-side tenth-floor penthouses in an arrangement deemed altogether progressive by her globe-trotting , peripatetic parents who shared a rich mutual loathing for each other that was always generously in evidence whenever Kat and her friends were around . <br> We were brown-bagging it as we often did on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , seriously hot . He was smiling at me with this kind of unworldly confidence that was n't shot through with the transparent come-on you detected in guys about to make their move . <br> " Good afternoon , ladies , " he said , greeting us with a voice bright and bold like a David Hockney canvas . " I do n't mean to disturb your lunch but I wondered how three works of art managed to escape the <br> museum ? " <br> OK , it was a line , but , trust me , coming from that face and with that accent , he sold it . He had Hugh 's to-die-for British pedigree that had always made me weak in the pit of my stomach . We had barely exchanged names when the fact-finding Katrina asked Colin what it was he did for a living . He smiled , and his gaze locked on mine in a way that sent little lightning bolts through me . <br> " I 'm an investigative reporter for NBC . What I do is try to uncover the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a laugh . <br> And then leaning in , his incredibly blue eyes on mine , he said the most remarkable thing . <br> " Really , you have to forgive me ' cause I absolutely never do this , but I have the strangest feeling that you are going to be part of my life . Is n't that wild ? " <br> I knew Katrina , not one to give people the benefit of the doubt , had bought it as a line he must have used before . Abby was smitten . But all I wondered was whether there was any possible response that would n't make me sound as if I 'd dumped my brains in the East River and replaced them with Jell-O . It was a mad and outrageous thing to say and I was <br> rendered mute . His eyes were on me exclusively . He did n't even look at Katrina , who was tall , with short , ginger hair and a Cameron Diaz figure , or at Abby , who was Natalie Portman  --  like beautiful and possessed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she was twelve . <br> Seven and a half hours later we were on a first date . He took me to Babbo in the Village where , contrary to my normal dating procedure of pick and nibble , Colin encouraged me to actually eat the parmigiana I 'd ordered . He said he hated women who always talked about their weight when , far as he was concerned , a good meal was part of the joy of being alive . Not partaking was , he said , and I was struck by the words he used , denying the person you were with the pleasure of your pleasure . <br> I immediately inhaled the meatball he offered me and nearly <br> passed out . <br> It blew me away that he seemed so interested in my love of art , enchanted that I 'd envisioned fairies dancing on lily pads on Monet 's Giverny paintings when visiting the Met with my family at ten or how , at twelve , I 'd been drawn to the passionate drippings of Jackson Pollock in a visit to MoMA . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For an Oxford man who 'd come to the States and graduated from Columbia 's School of Journalism , Colin was amazingly open to the dreams of someone other than himself . Men do n't come at you like that , confident enough to let you talk , not having to fill up the conversation with noise about what they 've accomplished to prove they are worthy of a hookup . <br> It was later that night , after his lips gently brushed across mine outside my Village walk-up , that I remembered words my bubbe had once shared with me . I 'd been in the ninth grade and she 'd surprised me by coming to the high school to pick me up . We strolled the park , having one of our woman-to-woman chats she 'd started after my bat mitzvah . <br> " How did you know Zayde was the right man for you ? " I 'd asked her between licks of the chocolate-chocolate-chip ice cream cones we both <br> favored . <br> She paused , smiled this glowing smile , and said , " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it 's smart , it follows . " <br> As I watched Colin disappear into the growing mist that night fourteen months ago , I realized that was exactly what was happening  --  my head was following my heart . <br> Never once since that magical , perfect evening did I think it even remotely possible that the roles would get reversed.r <br> Continues ...
