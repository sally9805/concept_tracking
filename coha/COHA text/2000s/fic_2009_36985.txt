Have mercy ! Lord , have mercy on my poor soul ! " Women gave birth and whispered cries like this in caves and out-of-the-way places that humans did n't usually use for birthplaces . Moses had n't come yet , and these were the years when Israel first made tears . Pharaoh had entered the bedrooms of Israel . The birthing beds of Hebrews were matters of state . The Hebrew womb had fallen under the heel of Pharaoh . A ruler great in his newness and new in his greatness had arisen in Egypt and he had said , " This is law . Hebrew boys shall not be born . All offenders against this law shall suffer death by drowning . " <p> So women in the pains of labor hid in caves and rocks . They must cry , but they could not cry out loud . They pressed their teeth together . A night might force upon them a thousand years of feelings . Men learned to beat upon their breasts with clenched fists and breathe out their agony without sound . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the roof of hell . The shadow of Pharaoh squatted in the dark corners of every birthing place in Goshen . Hebrew women shuddered with terror at the indifference of their wombs to the Egyptian law . <p> The province of Goshen was living under the New Egypt and the New Egyptian and they were made to know it in many ways . The sign of the new order towered over places of preference . It shadowed over work , and fear was given body and wings . <p> The Hebrews had already been driven out of their well-built homes and shoved further back in Goshen . Then came more decrees : <p> Israel , you are slaves from now on . Pharaoh assumes no responsibility for the fact that some of you got old before he came to power . Old as well as young must work in his brickyards and road camps . <br> No sleeping after dawn . Fifty lashes for being late to work . <br> Fifty lashes for working slow . <br> One hundred lashes for being absent . <br> One hundred lashes for sassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Babies take notice : Positively no more boy babies allowed among Hebrews . Infants defying this law shall be drowned in the Nile . <p> Hebrews were disarmed and prevented from becoming citizens of Egypt , they found out that they were aliens , and from one new decree to the next they sank lower and lower . So they had no comfort left but to beat their breasts to crush the agony inside . Israel had learned to weep . <p> <br> <p> Chapter Two <p> The sun was setting . Under the brilliant , cloudless Egyptian sun thousands of Hebrew workers were struggling with building stones . Some of their backs were bloody from the lash ; many of them were stoopy from age and all of them were sweaty and bent and tired from work . The Egyptian foreman gazed at the drooping sun in awe and breathed with reverence : " Ah , Horus , golden god ! Lord of both horizons . The weaver of the beginning of things ! " <p> Amram , struggling with the help of another man to move a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up . <p> " Horus may be all those good things to the Egyptians , brother , but that sun-god is just something to fry our backs . " <p> " I heard him what he said , " the other worker whispered back . " If Horus is the weaver of the beginning of things , he 's done put some mighty strange threads in his loom . " <p> " And still and all I used to admire him too , before this new government come in , did n't you ? " <p> " Uhuh . I used to admire everything in Egypt . But the palms and the plains ai n't scenery to me no more . They just look like suffering to me now . " <p> " They look that way to me too , now , " Amram whispered back , " and the worst part about it is , my wife is going to have another baby . " <p> " I heard about it , Amram . What you going to do ? Take her off in the wilderness like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caleb . One man was telling me he hid his wife out in a boat until it was all over . Turned out to be a girl so it was all right . " <p> " How soon you expecting ? " <p> " Of course you ca n't never be sure exactly , but we figure in two or three days more . I 'm planning on hunting up some good cave or some place like that the secret police do n't know about yet . Thought I 'd take tonight to locate a place . Will you go along with me ? " <p> " Sure I will . You got the midwife engaged ? " <p> " Yes , that 's all fixed up . Going to send my boy Aaron and my girl Miriam along to help around generally . They can do little things around and watch out for spies . Old Puah , the midwife , knows her business all right and she 's just as loyal as she can be , but she 's getting kind of old , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a sizeable boy and girl to run errands and to stand watch . It 's liable to happen while we are at work , you know . " <p> " Oh , yes , and that 's how come I want to find a place and get it sort of fixed up with a quilt or two for my wife to rest on and some water and things like that so when the time comes I wo n't need to worry . It 's a sin and a shame our wives ca n't even have a baby in peace . " <p> " And that 's just the reason I want to go with that delegation to see old Pharaoh tonight . You know a bunch of us are going tonight to see him to protest these new decrees , do n't you ? " <p> " Sure , but I do n't believe it 'll do a bit of good . Still and all I want to go just to see what he 's going to say this time . <p> <br> Continues ...      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
