IN THE BRIGHT OCTOBER SUN , Ferrell and his ex hike the rocky hills behind the cabin , up along the ridge where the world falls away . To each compass point the land stretches without end , enough to dwarf his skinny frame beneath the huge scary sky . he knows Rilla wants to reach the top out of breath and shaking , wants to deserve the view before her , all that air and nothing to stop her eyes . She especially likes the ridge on the rare days after rain , when the air is clear enough to make them both weep . She says there 's no space between the moonscape below and where she stands , as if she can touch the distant buttes with her outstretched hands . <p> " I never get tired of your backyard , " she says at the top this pristine morning . " The whole place changes with each angle of the sun , with each shadow the clouds put down . " <p> Rilla has spent summer 's end in his high desert home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uninvited but not unwanted . After three bachelor years in Idaho , Ferrell is downright enjoying the break from solitude and retreat . Her two-day stay has lasted two months , a fact neither of them speaks into the air . <p> Rilla is still huffing from the steady hard climb , her chest heaving beneath her OHIO Is FOR LOVERS ? T-shirt , sweat like cut diamonds across her brow . " I feel like jumping out of my skin , Ferrell , " she says . " I feel I could truly fly . " She gathers her light red hair into the pony tail of her youth , twists in place a thick rubber band . When she wipes her face with the hem of her baggy shirt , his blood quickens at the unexpected flash of belly . <p> Ferrell walks the ragged spine of the ridge and takes a physical accounting . Due east , across 150-odd miles , the postcard peaks of Sun Valley stand dirty white in the sun . A few degrees south and a hundred miles closer , the long runways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert sage . From the ridge at night he often watches the runway lights glitter like strung Christmas bulbs . Now and again a handful of lights will detach and glide upward , a night fighter off to patrol the hostile world . Sometimes when Ferrell is out walking , pairs of space age jets wheel low over his head , visitors from the future , he imagines , come for the day . he always wishes them well with what they 'll find . <p> Rilla comes to stand wordless beside him , a silent companion to his clamorous thoughts . Without explanation she draws her shirt over her head . In a practiced motion he knows by heart she unhooks her bra and hands both pieces of clothing to him . Her nipples tighten in the breeze , a lovely event Ferrell has never ceased admiring . Rilla unbuckles her walking shorts and slips them over her boots , then does the same with her white cotton undies . She gives these things to Ferrell as well . <p> " That 's better , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get airborne . " <p> Though he 's seen Rilla naked more times than he can count , Ferrell feels weak watching his ex in hiking boots only , her skin smooth alabaster in the sun , a fine sweat sheen between her bare breasts . In all this open air she seems naked as she 's ever been , as naked as she can ever be . her scarlet womanhood a creation of singular divine beauty . <p> " Wow , " he says . " You do all right for fifty . " <p> " I do all right for any age . " Rilla fluffs herself down below , works her fingers through the tiny tangles . " I 've never understood the big deal over this puff of hair . There is n't a whole lot to admire . " <p> " It 's where the universe begins and ends , Rilla . It 's the very portal to immortality . The secret fountain of eternal youth . " <p> Rilla frowns out of feminist obligation , but he can tell she 's not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind , those lowly places where his thoughts chug ale in bawdy roadhouse inns . " I 'm not a portal to anywhere or anything , Ferrell Swan . And that fountain thing is just plain weird . You 'll need to stave off death in some other way . " <p> " There is n't any other way , " he says , but she does n't seem to hear . <p> Rilla raises both arms skyward and twirls . She jumps up to challenge gravity 's hold , but her boots raise dust as she lands back down . She faces the grand spectacle of the Owyhee Mountains , looming just fifteen miles distant , as if to rival their true natural beauty . <p> Ferrell tries to study those craggy peaks of granite and pine , but the years he 's known this woman , his acute knowledge of her , occupies all the space inside his head . Rilla Gabriella Swan-horsewoman virtuoso , Tai Chi devotee , third-wife passion flower , on most days his intellectual and emotional superior , his equal in all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of love and , unlike most of her fellow flower children , she never went establishment , corporate , or any other way . She has kept herself young , Ferrell knows , by working with the youth of the new millennium , the most popular crisis counselor Ohio 's troubled-teen network has ever known . She can talk and walk with the little dears , can deal out as much toughness and love as the kids need . In short , a whole lot of woman in one small package . <p> Ferrell looks to the south , away from Rilla and the Owyhees rising like violence 's own special tribute . The land in the distance seems to take on the curve of the earth-more land than a man could cross in a week , a month , a life . Sometimes he believes he is not meant to see so much at once , not meant to stare at this many miles , to understand the planet 's actual size . Here Ferrell has gone off to the desert for his forty days and found Lucifer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just his own head and its scattered electrical workings . It 's more than he bargained for : rattlers in the kitchen , coyotes at the door , heat that wants the air to burn . he had wanted retreat , he knew that much , but the price for exile runs high . <p> " Let 's walk the north forty , " Rilla says , hiking into the ravine , opposite the way they came . <p> Ferrell starts down the backside of the ridge , away from his cabin and barn and the civilized world . Down this side of his land he could be in the days of Butch and Sundance . After the divorce Ferrell came west , cut loose from husbandom and thirty years of boring ninth graders in the lessons of American history . he wanted to live out his days beneath the wide , curving sky , to ride with the spirits of every misfit and outcast come before him , and so bought an even hundred acres in southern Idaho , his log home nestled amongst tumbleweed and sage and a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine how all that kid teaching was accomplished with just books and blather , ca n't imagine he taught about something he did n't truly know . <p> Ferrell watches the globes of Rilla 's fine bum , her smooth back with its taut flexing , her long red hair now loose in the wind . he tries to remember the first time he saw the hidden parts of the female form and decides it was Missy O'Connor , out behind the Little League dugout . He guesses they must have been ten when Missy dropped her one-piece just for him , his interest in baseball gone before it could even begin . <p> Fifty years , he thinks , and still amazed . <p> At the bottom of the ridge rests the complete skeleton of a wild mustang , the wildness still there though the bones do n't move . Ferrell discovered the skeleton when he first hiked his land , amazed at the bright white skull and its dark eerie sockets , at the curved hoopwork of ribs , the long leg shafts tucked as if the animal still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never diminishes over time . <p> To his shock Rilla kneels before the bones . She takes the enormous skull in her hands , lifts it from where it has rested for untold years . She turns away and slips the thing over her head , the rear of the skull resting on the back of her slender neck . When she faces Ferrell he grows loose in the knees for the second time that morning : a horse skull atop the body of a very naked woman , some ancient creature from native folklore , some monster from dreams born of desire and fear . Rilla stares out through the sockets , her eyes locked on him , the long narrow snout casting shadow on her breasts . <p> " I am the mistress of the horse god , " she says , her muffled words in the voice of someone else . <p> " Lucky god , " Ferrell says , more unsettled than he wants to be . He feels his reality a bit too altered right now , feels they 've changed from who they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You dare to mock the horse god ? " Rilla says . " You dare to look upon his mistress with lustful eyes ? " <p> Ferrell stands sweating beneath the hot sun . he does n't know why the moment has turned so creepy so fast . he wants to say he 's spooked , but ca n't utter a word . It strikes him that soon she may be gone , headed back to that red brick house in their quaint Ohio hometown. he pictures his cabin without her , the small rooms again just rooms and nothing more . he thinks to tell her something important about their lives , something that will make her spring into his arms , but he knows each and every insight is lost when spoken aloud . To his relief , Rilla takes off the skull before he can answer . <p> " You lost your chance there , Ferrell . I hear them horse women can make a man beg . " <p> " Or worse , " Ferrell says , and smiles to hide his fears . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the skeleton with its skull returned . In time they plot a wide circle back toward their place , picking their way along the low lunar hills with Rilla in the lead , her bare back glistening with sweat . Her shoulders and neck take on a reddish hue , and Ferrell rubs sunblock from his daypack on his nudist ex-wife . As they reach the edge of the dry wash , Rilla stops short . <p> " What 's that ? " she says , pointing . <p> Ferrell sights along her outstretched arm to find the air vent and chimney of Din Winters 's underground bunker , before them as if a mirage . Winters had bought his parcel before Ferrell bought his , and buried on his land three ten-thousand-gallon gasoline tanks bought at the salvage yard in Meridian . he said they were unearthed when a gas station was torn down , and he cleaned and treated and painted their curved inner walls until the gas stink was just a pungent memory . With his own backhoe he reburied the three tanks in a T pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get right . When Ferrell got the tour , he was amazed with the roominess of the underground complex , but this surprise was tempered by the sharp feeling he had been buried alive . <p> " It 's just one of your neighbors , " he says , hoping to downplay the secret kept from her since she arrived . he had n't wanted to burden Rilla. with the knowledge of a man who lives beneath the endless sand . She 's always been skeptical about the state , its shady reputation as outlaw sanctuary , and this guy would n't help none . <p> Rilla gives Ferrell the eye . She does n't even bother to ask for explanation , just waits for him to fess up . <p> " OK , " he says . " He 's from California , and he lives in real big gas tanks down below . " <p> " Is he one of those hate-mongers ? " <p> " Far as I can tell , he 's a refugee from hate . he says he left the gem eral populace when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of gotten into a reclusive mood . " <p> " Let 's go visit him , " Rilla says , and starts walking . <p> Ferrell catches up and takes her arm . " He does n't really like company . That 's the idea . " he nods in her direction . " You 're also naked . " <p> Rilla reaches for the clothes he has kept bundled in his arms . <p> At Winters 's buried home , Rilla stands speechless with her hands on her hips . Except for the scores of footprints , and the pair of short pipes sticking from the ground , the place is nothing but rocks and silver sage . <p> " He really lives in the ground ? " she finally says . " Like those crazies on CNN ? " <p> " Where he got the idea . " <p> " How 's he get down there ? " <p> Ferrell points to a metal trap door painted the color of the sand , its curved handle barely visible . <p> " Jesus , " Rilla says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trap door . He pounds the metal twice , pauses , then raps two more times . Against his will comes the sensation he 's waking some beast better left alone . <p> " What was that ? " Rilla says . <p> " The signal he said to use . " <p> " You been here before ? " <p> " One time , " he says . " Gave me the willies . " <p> As Rilla readies her answer , Ferrell hears clanking down below , and then the door lifts an inch , a wedge of darkness in which Ferrell sees not a thing . <p> " That you , Swan ? " <p> " In the flesh . " <p> " Who 's with you ? " <p> " My wife . " <p> " Thought she left you ? " <p> Rilla steps to the edge of the trap door . " I came back , " she says a bit too loud , as if Winters might be out of practice with the spoken word . She gets down on all fours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal frame . " You going to come out into the light of day ? " <p> The door clangs shut like a rifle shot . Ferrell listens as the noise sails off to the hills and returns to them changed . He 's not in the mood for the neuroses of others , given how many of his own he needs to constantly bear . <p> " Now you 've done it , " he says . <p> But the trapdoor swings open until it rests on the ground , a gaping mouth into the belly of the earth . Din Winters climbs out with unexpected enthusiasm , blinking at the bright like the mole rat he is . His hair is cut shorter than Ferrell remembers , and he 's wearing his old EMT jumpsuit with SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY stitched over his heart . Winters pulls a pair of sunglasses from his breast pocket and puts them on . <p> " I do n't get visitors , " he says . <p> " So I 'm told , " she says , reaching out her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She holds her palm steady until Winters shakes her hand . <p> " FmDin . " ' <p> " All right then , " she says . " Nothing like a little civility in the wilds to bring folks together . " <p> " What now , Rilla ? " Ferrell says . <p> he watches Rilla and Winters do the gunfighter stare-down . They seem to be searching their past lives or something equally mystical , trying to figure if the other is friend or foe . Before Winters can save himself , Rilla steps forward and hugs him . he stands with his arms pinned to his sides , his questioning eyes asking Ferrell what the hell he has brought his way . Ferrell only shrugs . <p> " Sorry ' bout that , " Rilla says . " You looked like you needed a big dose of love and affection . " <p> " I 'm not a people person . " <p> " You do n't exaggerate , either . " <p> " Well , " Ferrell says , " we just come by for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Do n't let him fool you . I came to see your underground fortress , " Rilla says , her hand touching Winters lightly on the elbow . She stands between Ferrell and his hermit neighbor , a woman used to people whose hearts ca n't find a proper place to hide . <p> " Then so you shall , " Winters says , and bows stiffly from the waist , already under Rilla 's spell . <p> Midnight departs and Ferrell and Rilla still sit on the long comfy couch , their host holding court from a white leather armchair . all night Ferrell has meant to ask Winters how he got the furniture down the damn ladder , but he has n't had the chance . The revelry began at dinner , when Winters broke out some California red , a ten-year-old bottle of his best Cabernet . The man has kept the wine flowing ever since-Merlots , Sauvignons , Petite Sirahs-a regular stockpile of his favorite Napa wineries , hoarded below the earth against unnamed catastrophe . With the wine inside him Winters turned chatterbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . Ferrell has been happy enough to soar with the wine . <p> " After my wife left me to study batik in BaIi , I lost my zest for the day to day , " Winters says . <p> " Forgive the counselor in me , but did n't saving people help counter your loss ? " <p> " Oh , hell , saving people is highly overrated . The ones you save get all indebted to you , like they love you and not the thing you 've just done for them . Most people adore themselves way too much , and feel this great rush only because you 've handed their asses back to them . " <p> As if forgetting his guests , Winters holds his glass to the glow of the nearest oil lamp , swirls the wine in a colorful display , takes a sip . " But what pulls you down , " he says without missing a beat , " is the daily carnage , the gazillion knife wounds , gunshot wounds , ice pick wounds , Bic pen wounds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a human head . Blood pooled at your feet like spilled paint , so bright and incredibly red , fluorescent really , so much death you think it 's the way to go . " <p> " Goodness , " Rilla says . " That is one gloomy outlook . " <p> Winters stands and pulls the cork on another bottle . " It 's zero visibility , for sure . " he hands the cork to Rilla , who gives it a dainty sniff and nods . Winters pours wine into everyone 's glass , filling each to the brim . <p> " Are n't we supposed to have just a smidge in here ? " Rilla says . " Enough to simply wet our palates ? " <p> " We 're fasttracking , honey . We 're on an express route to ShangriLa and I 'm your conductor . You let old Din here show you the way . " <p> " Men can not show women squat . " <p> Winters looks at Rilla as if he 's been slapped . " You sound like my former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Now , do n't get me started on that particular topic . Do n't forget the full story here-she left me . " <p> " As I left old Mr. Swan . You see , you leave us first in your hearts and minds , " Rilla says , serious now despite the wine . " We just break the physical connection . We basically finish what you 're too weak to finish yourselves . We end the misery for all concerned . " <p> " That 's not how it felt to me , " Winters says . all at once he looks sad beyond belief , a man set back on his heels by his own history . <p> " It 's a kind of death , " Rilla says , as if talking only to her soul . " At his funeral this summer , Aunt Gallic said my dad died thirty years ago . She told me his divorce from Mom was the real funeral , the same damn thing with a different name . " Rilla finishes her wine and looks around for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-two , like the life went out of him . Ambition , courage , love of family , common decencyall gone like he 'd used up those things . " <p> " What happened after the divorce ? " Winters says . <p> " Oh , the Oprah stuff-he went through the rest of his life with his pecker leading the way . " <p> Ferrell studies Rilla as if he 's never truly seen her . She 's speaking some hard-won truths here , insights earned during their nightly coyote concerts on the porch , those starry hours when he knows she is searching the caverns of her heart , the cold dank places only pain can help you find . he understands they 're both orphans now , in this life . <p> " The world 's turned upside down , " Winters says , oblivious to the revelations swirling the room . " The weather 's all back-asswards , people have lost their minds . There are signs daily in the firmament . The night I moved here I saw a meteor burn like a rocket across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it roar , white fire sparking and crackling all around . I thought it was my very own death star , coming to blast me to tomorrow . " <p> Din looks straight at Ferrell with his eyes turned dark . <p> " You know , " he says , " my wife left me without so much as a goodbye and fuck you . I did n't even know where she was until I got the card from Ubud . " <p> Rilla glances at Ferrell and he knows it 's time to leave , that she 's done with this sad pale man with the broken heart . he nods slightly , the signal they used to use when it was time to leave some faculty social at the school , or some fund-raiser for the crisis center , when one of them had had enough of wasting their precious lives . They stand at the same time . <p> " You guys leaving so soon ? " <p> Rilla squints at her watch as if the numbers are hard to decipher . " It 's one something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't depart we 'll turn into pumpkins . " <p> Winters stands with an empty bottle in his hand . " The grape juice is almost gone , " he says . " We sure made a dent in my stash . " <p> " You can always get more vino , " Rilla says . " Take a trip back home , load up the trunk . " <p> " I 'm never setting foot in California again , " Winters says . " I 'm here and this is where I intend to stay . Hell , when I die I 'll already be under the ground . " <p> Rilla slips her palm into Ferrell 's , squeezes hard . he feels her tremble and shake beside him . She reaches for the ladder and starts to climb . <p> When they reach topside , Ferrell is surprised it has rained long and hard , the sand drenched , the air delicate perfume . Above them the night stars cram the sky , while all to the south lightning tears up the horizon in long spidery streaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as members of a tribe long past , watching the potent ire of their god . <p> " Damn , " Winters says . " That looks nasty . " <p> " Or beautiful , " Rilla says , swaying a bit on her heels . <p> " You know , " Winters says , " humans make great conductors , with their salty fluids sloshing around . Each and every person throws their own step leaders toward heaven , our personal glowing calling cards . Like our auras spin into a single rope for God to yank us home . " <p> Ferrell knows this to be true . he remembers old Tom Ferbash , the science teacher at Dover junior High , explaining over many brown-sack lunches the intricacies of lightning strikes . <p> " Lightning , " Winters says in almost a whisper , " has been known to travel twenty miles or more , seeking people whole towns away . A man once got killed off his mountain bike in the Haight with nothing but blue above him . " <p> " Can that happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Anything 's possible . You can get blown out of your shoes holding the handle of your fridge , or zapped off the crapper while reading the news . " <p> " On the commode ? " Rilla says . <p> " I had a dozen calls for lightning strikes during my time . Oddest thing you 've ever seen . Saw a woman once with her clothes shredded off her . The lightning left these tiny forked veins across her chest , like a perfect miniature bolt emblazoned on her skin . " Din spreads his arms before them . " Lightning can fix you dead without even touching you , can stop your old ticker with just its electromagnetic field . They find hikers in the mountains all the time , young and healthy and dead , not a mark on them . " <p> " You make it sound like lightning tries to get us , " Rilla says . <p> " Oh , hell , if it wants you bad enough , lightning will hunt you down . There was a forest ranger in northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they called him , a chosen man . " <p> Ferrell wavers a bit where he stands . He 's three sheets and then some , the wine pumping through him like new blood . From somewhere atop the ridge a coyote yips at the night , and he closes his eyes to let the sound be all there is-no billion stars to distract him , no ex-wife he still loves , no lonely underground dweller wishing to die . The cry rises with real talent on the air , a fevered improvisation of short yikes and yaps , each note sunk true into Ferrell 's fragile heart . When the coyote finishes what it needs to say , Ferrell opens his eyes to find Winters watching him . <p> " They 're called God 's dog , you know ? Indians named them that . " <p> " I bet they are , " Rilla says , her hand upon Ferrell 's arm . <p> Winters rubs his palms over his face . " Little buggers drive me to the edge . all that full moon foolishness . I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking my choice to live among them . " <p> " The Nez Perce thought they created the world , " Ferrell says . <p> " Well , I 'm glad I live beneath the soil where I ca n't hear the ridicule , night after freakin ' night . " <p> " Maybe they are cheering you on , " Rilla says . " Maybe they are saying , ' Din Winters , you the man . ' " <p> In what little light surrounds them Winters looks stumped , his brain unable to make the turn Rilla has put before him . " I saw you up on the ridge , " he says . " I saw you butt naked with my field glasses . " <p> " How was I ? " <p> " About half an inch tall , " Winters says . he looks in the direction of the fiery storm , his shoulders slumped , defeated in a battle he did not want or choose . <p> " I 'm off to bed , " he says at last . he hugs Rilla longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starlight , then shakes Ferrell 's hand . Winters 's palm is a cold soft thing , part of a creature who dwells beyond the sun . <p> " You come back soon , " he says . <p> " You bet , " Ferrell says , knowing he wo n't . <p> " For sure , " Rilla says , but Ferrell hears she feels the same . The mart is a certified doomsayer , and black clouds hover constantly above him , bathe him in shadow wherever he goes . <p> Ferrell stands in the coarse sand , his toes within his boots like roots spreading down . Above him the stars drift loose in the sky , some breaking free to fall in their own smoky streaks . Rilla tugs him into motion , and he follows her on the long trek toward home . <p> Ferrell stumbles through a night made otherworldly after his time below . he feels released from something , set free-a submariner , perhaps , surfaced after months beneath the black sea . The land tilts and rolls , wobbles like a moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches the brilliant flashes careen along the rim of the earth . He knows every fifty yards or so a new step leader is born , the strike jagging in a different direction , angling ever toward that negative charge . At times the bolts hammer the desert plain , but most scatter lengthwise across the low sky , the clouds flaring for miles in each direction . Now and again he hears the faint roll of thunder , a rumble so deep it seems to tremble the unstable ground . <p> Ferrell and Rilla hike through aromatic sage , guided like sailors by the bright map of the stars . Rilla gets out ahead of him , inspired as she is , and Ferrell works up a head of steam to keep from losing her . Soon he comes across a cluster of shadow shapes on the ground and fears the worst , something on the order of vengeful rattlers waiting in the dark , Rilla lying somewhere with venom loosed within her . <p> When Ferrell reaches down , he expects the hot jab of twin fangs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy canvas walking shorts and cotton underwear , her sweaty damp socks . he wonders where her boots have gone . A few feet ahead he spots the pale dimness of the OHIO Is FOR LOVERS ? T-shirt , the white coiled bra , and then Rilla lies before him in the sand , her dark outline as if his own shadow has been thrown to the ground . <p> Ferrell becomes a sudden giant above Rilla 's waiting love . he knows the wine and the potent loneliness of Winters , radiating off the man as a beacon of loss-plus the horizon ablaze like fate approaching-has them both randy as wildcats , their desire risen to the surface of their skin , their flesh and bones turned into nothing but need , their blood hot as the streaks in the distant sky . he pulls free of his clothes , slips from his boots . he stands in the sleek indigo breeze with his bare skin tightening , caressed as if by a loving hand , his nerves tingling like they 've been exposed to the air . His manhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking something more vital than water . <p> " Hurry , Ferrell , " Rilla says . " Get down here before I cry . " <p> When Ferrell drops to his knees in the wet sand , he feels about to enter the earth itself , Rilla lost as she is in the desert night . he thinks , oddly , of the mistress of the horse god , expects to touch that giant skull when he seeks her with his mouth , but it 's only Rilla 's tender cheek against his lips , her warm hands like serenity , like absolute salvation , upon his shoulders . <p> Ferrell feels his body awash in negative ions , feels the barometer of his heart plummet off the scale . he slips inside her and believes this time they will rival the very sky . As the heavens erupt around them , he imagines their own neon step leaders reaching from their crowns , rising ever skyward . His scalp begins to tingle , the few hairs he has left standing on end . <p> " You do n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear ? You do n't just leave me alone in all this fucking space . " <p> Ferrell nods his head , prays he 'll last as long as she needs , last far beyond every want , beyond every desire , she could possibly begin to possess . <p>
