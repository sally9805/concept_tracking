In the weeks following the last great domestic disaster , 9/11 , the American Red Cross stockpiled blood for those who did n't need it , refused to share critical victim information with other charities , and was dressed down before Congress for planning to use relief funds to improve its internal operations . So is it good news that , as reported by the Chronicle of Philanthropy , of the $1.06 billion American charities have raised for Katrina relief so far  --  a record pace  --  a remarkable 72% , or $762.5 million , went to the Red Cross ? <P> Despite the group 's past blunders , charity watchdogs insist the $3 billion giant , mandated by Congress to work with federal agencies to aid victims of natural disasters , has risen to Katrina 's various challenges . " The Red Cross has turned over a new leaf , " says Daniel Borochoff , president of the American Institute of Philanthropy . Fund raising has obviously not been a problem . The organization teamed with Google , MSN and Yahoo ! to channel money through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet . Though not as forthcoming with details of its spending as critics would like , the Red Cross is at least edging toward transparency . It says it has used $358.7 million of its cash to house more than 380,000 Katrina survivors in shelters and hotels , serve nearly 9.8 million hot meals , and provide mental-health counseling to more than 235,000 people . " One thing the Red Cross has learned since 9/11 , " says Eugene Tempel , executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University , " is the importance of communicating more openly , more deliberately . " <P> The agency 's response has had its flaws . At the height of the New Orleans flooding , the Red Cross followed government orders to steer clear of the Superdome and New Orleans Convention Center , leaving starving people stranded . A few posers have slipped through the cracks : a Georgia woman is in county jail for scamming the charity out of $1,300 in relief funds . In Mississippi , victims have complained about a lack of Red Cross presence . In Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for cash or supplies and had to write checks by hand . <P> All of this raises the question : Should Americans continue to pour so much money into a single nonprofit known more for first response than for long-term rebuilding ? " The beauty of the nonprofit sector is its diversity , " says Borochoff . " Americans need to figure out that they should use the Red Cross , but do n't use the whole wad . Save it for some other groups . " <P> The Red Cross , insisting it 's in the Gulf for the long haul , aims to raise millions more in donations . Smaller charities may want the Red Cross to spread the wealth , but " the Red Cross raised the money fair and square , " says Trent Stamp , executive director of nonprofit-rating agency Charity Navigator . " We have to understand it 's going to spend as it sees fit . "  --  By Sean Gregory . With reporting by Greg Fulton/Atlanta                 @ @ @ @
