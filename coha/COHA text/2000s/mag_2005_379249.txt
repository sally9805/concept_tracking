Although she 's hardly your average freshman , Jessica Lynch in a few weeks will be trying hard to blend in at West Virginia University . At 22 , the former Army supply clerk , who became an icon after her dramatic rescue from an Iraqi hospital in 2003 , hopes one day to be a kindergarten teacher . She spoke with TIME 's Wendy Cole about coping with the attention and prefreshman jitters . <P> HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING AMBUSHED IN IRAQ ? <P> Every day . There 's always something that reminds me of Lori Piestawa , a friend who was killed during the attack or one of my fellow comrades . Last night there were fireworks going off outside our hotel in Saratoga Springs , N.Y . I have to literally see the fireworks . If I just hear them , they sound a little like gunshots or bombs  --  it kind of puts you back there . <P> LOOKING BACK , DO YOU FEEL YOU WERE USED BY THE MILITARY TO INCREASE AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR THE WAR IN ITS EARLY STAGES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody 's confidence about the war . I was used as a symbol . They could show the war was going great because " we rescued this person . " It does n't bother me anymore . It used to . Through my book I Am a Soldier , Too : The Jessica Lynch Story , written by Rick Bragg , I have been able to set the record straight . I did what I could do and now let the record speak for itself . <P> WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA WILL PAY FOR YOUR COLLEGE TUITION , DO YOU THINK OTHER VETERANS WILL RESENT THE SPECIAL TREATMENT ? <P> I 'm sure that 's happening . But I think I definitely paid the price . I do n't feel that I 'm a hero or that I 've done anything spectacular . I 'm not trying to take advantage of the situation . These things are coming my way . If they were put in my shoes , they would be doing the same . <P> DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BLEND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It 's to the point at which I 'm able to handle it better . It was hard getting stopped all the time when I was n't used to it . It does n't bother me now . But I do n't want any special attention drawn to me . I 'll try to blend in as much as I can . I have to say I am a little nervous  --  the freshmen that I 'll be with were eighth-graders when I graduated from high school . <P> ARE YOU STILL GETTING PHYSICAL THERAPY ? I UNDERSTAND YOU 'RE WALKING WITH A CANE . <P> I feel great , though my recovery is still going slow . If I put the effort in and work at it , I think I 'll be able to get rid of the canes forever . It 's a goal I think I can reach . I 'm busy with traveling and getting ready for school , but I still usually get physical therapy for about an hour a day . The only accommodation I need is a shower chair . <P> NEXT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKSON COUNTY , OHIO . DO YOU SAY YES TO MOST INVITATIONS FOR APPEARANCES OR SPEECHES ? <P> It depends on my schedule . I 've been invited to some pretty wild , crazy things . I ca n't do everything . I would love to be there for everybody , but there 's only one of me . I 'll have to cut back when school starts . <P> DOES THE FANFARE HELP MAKE UP FOR YOUR INJURIES AND LOSS OF CLOSE FRIENDS ? <P> I would do anything to have my friends with me . I would definitely choose them over the travel and all the experiences and the fame .
