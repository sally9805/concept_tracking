<p> Guitars in high gear on ' Phantom Planet ' <p> ROCK <p> * " Phantom Planet " <p> Phantom Planet . Epic/Daylight. 11 tracks . <p> Grade : C <p> Thus far , Phantom Planet has enjoyed most of its fame by association . The guy from " Rushmore " ( Jason Schwartzman ) was the drummer . " California , " the single from its long-floundering sophomore album " The Guest , " is the title track for TV 's new favorite eye candy , " The O.C. " That kind of thing . Well , Schwartzman has committed himself full time to acting , and the band has already rereleased " The Guest "  --  with shiny new bonus tracks of course  --  to capitalize on its new small screen audience . So the path is clear to focus on the five-man band 's music ; a prudent move because that 's about the only good thing here . Lead singer-guitarist Alex Greenwald 's drowsy moans are interesting only in their similarities to the Strokes ' Julian Casablancas . And the all-important hook quotient  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  only stands out in " Big Brat " and " 1st Things 1st . " What remains  --  and what 's wisely pushed way upfront  --  is their ragged , urgent and often-appealing guitars , which sprint through ska ( " Badd Business , " " Jabberjaw " ) , somewhat derivative retro-pop ( " The Happy Ending , " " By the Bed " ) and tall waves of distorted chords ( " You 're Not Welcome Here " ) , like an early morning doorbusters crowd on a cheap DVD player hunt . <p>  --  Sonia Murray <p> POP <p> * " Sweetheart : Love Songs " <p> Various artists . Hear Music . 13 tracks . <p> Grade : B+ <p> In a nice idea that mostly works , Starbucks ' favorite record label asked a baker 's dozen artists to record their favorite love songs and give you , the coffee-drinking consumer , a tasteful impulse-buy compilation for Valentine 's Day . <p> The project succeeds because the people at Hear Music  --  who I suspect feel guilty about peddling tunes for The Man  --  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they like , which means that Clem Snide , Josh Ritter , Miho Hatori , Nada Surf and the Canadian singer-songwriter juggernaut of Kathleen Edwards , Ron Sexsmith and Sarah Harmer all choose interesting stuff to cover . <p> Ritter makes the most refreshing choice of the bunch , doing justice to the adorable " Tonight You Belong To Me , " which will make you cry if you 're the kind of person who remembers " The Jerk " as a love story . Nada Surf does a Francoise Hardy song . Hatori refreshes Madonna 's " Crazy For You . " Ever romantic , Sexsmith goes with " Moonlight Becomes You . " <p> Wrapping up the disc , Jon Hyde performs Buck Owens ' " Your Tender Loving Care " almost too well . By the time it was over , I found myself missing the man I wish were still around to sing stuff like this : Gram Parsons . The kids at Hear Music woulda loved him . <p>  --  Nick Marino <p> RAP <p> * " Juve the Great " <p> Juvenile . Cash Money/Universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and <p> * " Big Money Heavy Weight " <p> Big Tymers . Cash Money/Universal Records . 20 tracks . <p> Grade : C+ <p> Since they first thought to pair two turntables and a microphone , rappers have been especially proficient at undeserved and downright ridiculous braggadocio . But in regards to this particular title , in all honesty , Juvenile actually was great . His explosive 1998 breakthrough single " Ha " vividly introduced the hip-hop world to the New Orleans projects , and the delivery in his follow-up , " Back That Thing Up , " could still be heard in Missy Elliott 's wonderfully buoyant single " Work It " four years later . Then , just like that , the melodies and ingenuity seemed to stop . Juvenile left the Cash Money label he helped launch and legitimize , his criminal record started getting more attention than the ones he had in stores , and things looked about over . But here he is , four CDs after " 400 Degreez " with an album that does n't put him back in the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-house producer-artist Mannie Fresh also has returned , reintroducing Juvenile with the tolerable first single " In My Life , " as well as contributing four other songs . The funny thing is , the best tracks are n't those five . Instead , they 're the newcomer-crafted " Sex In Advance , " " For Everybody " and " Slow Motion , " all winding , rhythmic uses of guitars and horns that make three songs about one subject  --  sex  --  worth individual listens . <p> Clearly Fresh saved his best production work for the Big Tymers , the duo he formed with rapper/label President Bryan " Baby ' " Williams . Almost every track on this hour-plus offering is soulful , from the organs and horn sections on " Southern Boy " to the wisely used Honey Cone sample in " I 'll Take You There " to what could be a loop of an old hound barking on " I 'm A Dog . " At the same time , almost every single song seems to say the same thing  --  and with the exception of guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same flat , predictable way . They have loads of money , loads of cars , loads of women . OK . We get it . Guess they made this for the people who drink loads of the Hpnotiq and champagne they mention repeatedly . In that state , the beat 's probably all that matters anyway . <p>  --  Sonia Murray <p> POP <p> * " She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty " <p> Sinead O'Connor . Vanguard . 32 tracks . <p> Grade : A- <p> Couple years ago , Sinead O'Connor showed up for Mass one Sunday at a downtown Atlanta church . Dressed in a dark blue outfit that looked to be a uniform of some sort , she seemed tiny , engrossed by the service and grateful no one seemed to notice her . On her Web site , she has posted a letter to fans saying that after 22 years in the music business , she wants to blend into everyday life , if possible  --  as she did that Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late last year is not so much a greatest hits collection as a stirring last dance . Disc 1 , rare and previously unreleased studio tracks , opens with two Latin hymns you imagine she learned when young , then segues into two numbers most singers love on first listen ( the Dan Penn soul anthem Aretha made famous , " Do Right Woman " followed by Boudleaux Bryant 's " Love Hurts " ) . A few demos ( " You Put Your Arms Around Me " ) and surprises ( " Brigidine Diana , " a hymn to the late Princess of Wales ) later , she closes off the first disc with four dub-swept songs . If there were a niche to put her recent work in , it would be dubCeltronica , since she makes from those seemingly disparate strands an enveloping style . Disc 2 is a live concert recording ( out on DVD as " Goodnight , Thank You , You 've Been a Lovely Audience " ) of her recent Irish covers ( " The Moorlough Shore " ) and pop hits ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittingly as she began , with her unblinking farewell , " The Last Day of Our Acquaintance . " Whether this is really farewell or just another rest stop , it 's a hell of a parting gift . <p>  --  Eileen M. Drennen <p> * ON THE WEB : <p> www.vanguardrecords.com <p> DANCE <p> * " Fresh Goods " <p> The Tao of Groove . Groove Gravy . 14 tracks . <p> Grade : B- <p> If this record could be content being background music , it would be really cool . The slow chug of the harmonica and guitar at the start of " Honeybee Blues " promises an interesting journey , and " Mulatica Mia " warmly couples the sly drums heard on soul singer Carleen Anderson 's CDs with a robusto Cuban vocalist . But it is as if the Tao of Groove 's central figure , Roy Shakked , sees each track as a pillow , and that his job as writer , producer and arranger is to stuff it with as many disjointed elements as possible . So where " Mulatica " may start off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop an acoustic guitar , flute , cello and a pretty bad rapper from elbowing their way in . And that drum head tap leading the way on " Superspectral "  --  who could have known it would lead to violins , then flamenco guitar , then a drum and bass loop , then a turntable scratch , all topped off with the occasional computer game flutter ? It 's only when you hear Shakked 's attempt at a traditional arrangement , the Norah Jones-like " Maybe , " that the reason behind this supersized approach becomes clear : He is actually better at complicated than elementary . <p>  --  Sonia Murray
