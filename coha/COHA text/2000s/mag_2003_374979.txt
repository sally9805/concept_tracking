This is the hospital ward China 's Ministry of Health does n't want you to see . Here in the infectious-diseases section of Beijing 's You'an Hospital , dozens and dozens of patients with SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) are crammed into tiny rooms . " Every single one of us in this building is a SARS patient , " says a nurse named Zhang , who worked at the People 's Liberation Army Hospital No. 301 until 11 days ago when she was diagnosed with the disease and admitted to You'an . " There are at least 100 SARS patients here , if not several hundred . The conditions here are really bad . We 're not allowed out of this room . We pee in this room , crap in this room and eat in the room . As far as I know , at least half of the patients here are doctors and nurses from other hospitals . " <P> As a TIME reporter continued through the ward , another nurse who would n't give her name stopped him and explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this for your own good . It 's too dangerous here . Even we who work here do n't know when we 'll get it . Do n't believe the government . They never tell you the truth . They say it 's a deadly disease with 4% mortality ? Are you kidding me ? The death rate is at least 25% . In this hospital alone , there are more than 10 patients dead already . " <P> China , flush from having won the rights to host both the Beijing 2008 Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo , is presenting a rosy , reformist face to the rest of the world . But the nation 's handling of the deadly SARS epidemic , which is believed to have originated in southern Guangdong province last November , shows that behind closed doors , Beijing can be as secretive as ever . Extensive reports from local doctors suggest that the country 's health-care system remains hostage to a government that values power and public order above human lives . " You foreigners value each person 's life more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says a Shanghai respiratory specialist , who sits on an advisory committee dealing with epidemic diseases . " Our primary concern is social stability , and if a few people 's deaths are kept secret , it 's worth it to keep things stable . " <P> But Beijing 's emergency plan may be backfiring spectacularly with SARS , which has burst out of China 's national boundary to kill 119 people and infect 2,960 people worldwide by the end of last week . And even as the deadly pneumonia proliferates across the world  --  Africa is the latest continent afflicted with the bug  --  China continues to massively underreport its SARS epidemic . As late as last Saturday , China 's health authorities continued to stick to an accounting of 60 SARS deaths and about 1,300 cases  --  even though China 's Premier Wen Jiabao visited You'an Hospital , where medical staff say the full caseload there has not been incorporated into the figures .
