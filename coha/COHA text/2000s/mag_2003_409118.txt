Here are three straightforward ways investors can profit from a declining dollar . Each can work , but each has risks // Look out below ! Those three words pretty much sum up how the U.S. dollar has been faring in global currency markets . As the chart below shows , the greenback dropped almost 25% against Europe 's common currency , the euro , from January 2002 through mid-October 2003 , and more than 15% against the Japanese yen . There are several reasons . First , for years we 've been buying a lot more goods and services from abroad than we 've been selling there , which tends to depress our currency . Low U.S. interest rates also undercut the buck since , all other things being equal , investors tend to favor the currencies of countries with higher rates . And the growing deficit is raising doubts about the long-term strength of the dollar ( see Ron Insana 's interview with Robert Rubin on page 84 ) . There 's a widespread feelling among currency traders that the dollar would have dropped even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price advantage over U.S. goods in international markets . Add it all up , and many observers believe the dollar could fall ( another 10% to 20% over the next few years , although it 's likely to fall more vs . Asian currencies than vs. the euro . Following are three dollar plays that you do n't have to be George Soros to sxecute . That ' s not to say I 'm recommending that you try Them . " You have to be careful about making investment decisions based on currency forecasts , " warns Arnim Holzer , a senior investment strategist at Deutsche Asset Management . " Currencies can be very unstable , and they have a tendency to move unusually at times . " I agree completely , and those risks can be substantial in the first two strategies . INVEST IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY The most direct way to profit from a sliding buck is to open an account that 's funded with a foreign currency you believe will rise against the dollar . Previously , this tactic was pretty much limited to investors able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online bank that operates out of St. Louis , offers accounts in 17 foreign currencies with minimums as low as $2,500 ( although the bank pays interest only on balances of $10,000 or more ) . The latest addition : a money-market account ( with a $10,000 minimum ) denominated in Chinese yuan or , as it 's now known , the renminbi- " the people 's currency . " Let 's assume you think the euro-which recently traded at $1.18-will climb against the dollar over the next year . You could open a one-year euro CD , in effect converting your $10,000 into 8,475 euros ( $10,000 divided by $1.18 ) . Assuming you earn 1.4%-Everbank 's recent rate for one-year euro CDs-you 'd get 8,594 euros at the end of the year . If the dollar stays at $1.18 , you 'd have the equivalent of $10,141 for a gain of 1.4% . Nothing exciting there . But if the euro were to rise , say , 10% to $1.30 , your 8,594 euros would convert to $11,172 , for an 11.7% return . ( Actually , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion fee to open your account and again to cash it out . ) Of course , the currency effect can cut both ways . If the euro were to drop 10% to $1.06 , then your 8,594 euros would be worth $9,110-an 8.9% loss . I consider this strategy closer to speculation than investing because your profit hinges on guessing correctly about the future direction of the dollar . Even professional traders who can move quickly in and out of markets can get caught on the wrong side of currency movements . So unless you 're adept at discerning the various economic factors and government policy decisions that determine exchange rates , be wary of committing more than a token amount of cash to one of these accounts . GO FOR THE GLITTER Another way to capitalize on the dollar 's weakness is to find an investment that moves in the opposite direction . Gold fits the bill , in part because many safety-conscious investors flock to gold when the dollar weakens . Merrill Lynch research shows that over the past 10 years , gold has had a correlation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlation -1 ) , but extremely close . While the dollar dropped 23% and 9% , respectively , vs. the euro and yen for the two years through September , the price of gold climbed roughly 30% , and gold mutual funds on average Exploded for gains of just over 100% . It would be a mistake to assume a reprise of these returns over the next couple of years . As I pointed out in my May column , " Going for Gold , " gold is one of the most flighty investments around , not to mention one susceptible to long periods of very low or even negative returns , especially after big run-ups . So I see a gold play as even riskier than foreign currency accounts . BUY FOREIGN-STOCK FUNDS This is a more indirect play on the ailing buck , but I like it much better than the previous two . You invest in a broadly diversified fund that spreads its money around the globe ( the approach I prefer ) or in funds that specialize in Countries or regions ( a harder task unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sure to buy a fund that does not regularly hedge gainst currency fluctuations . If the dollar falls in value against the home currencies of the stocks in your fund , the currency change acts as a tailwind , boosting your return . Through the first nine months of this year , for example , Morgan Stanley Capital International 's EAFE index-which includes Foreign stocks of developed nations-gained 10.1% in local currency terms . But with the dollar falling , U.S. investors earned 18.4% . Quite a tailwind . Had the dollar rallied by the same magnitude against the euro , you 'd have confronted a headwind , and the EAFE 's gain in local currency would have shrunk to just over 2% . This may seem the same as investing in a foreign currency deposit account . But there 's an important difference . Equities generally have much higher inherent long-term profit potential than bank deposits . That means you have a better shot at earning a positive return even if the currency effect goes against you . For the five years through the end of 1999 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , funds specializing in European stocks managed to gain an annualized 22.4% in U.S. dollar terms because the underlying return on the stocks themselves more than overcame the unfavorable currency swing . Adding some foreign shares also lowers the volatility of your portfolio , since U.S. and foreign shares do n't always move in sync . You 'll have to decide which of these three strategies , if any , you feel comfortable with-and are confident you can pull off . But I 'll go with the one that not only gives me the chance to profit from a falling buck but also makes my portfolio less jumpy .
