Jessica Lynch is hardly the first American to have suffered in captivity . TERRY ANDERSON made TIME 's cover when he was released after being held for more than six years by the Islamic Jihad . <P> What is the best unit of measure for courage ? Is it registered in the 2,455 days lost , the countless millions of ribbons tied , the prayers asked , the letters sent , the rumors of death , the hopes dashed and then raised again ? Where did he find the generosity of spirit to smile when he walked out of captivity into a roomful of colleagues and told them , " You ca n't imagine how glad I am to see you . I 've thought about this moment for a long time , and now it 's here , and I 'm scared to death " ... Here was a man who had been wrapped like a corpse from head to foot in adhesive tape and moved from one hiding place to another . He endured beatings and blindfolds and boredom , months spent chained to furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world outside his grave . Yet there was no hatred , little bitterness , only that great wide smile and a promise of forgiveness that prompted millions who watched to wonder , How would I have fared ? Would I have had that strength ? <P>  --  TIME , Dec. 16 , 1991
