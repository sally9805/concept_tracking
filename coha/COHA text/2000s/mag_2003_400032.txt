That are the main elements of national well-being ? It is startling how out-of-date and out-of-touch our official politics has become // At kabuki performances in Japan audiences sometimes exclaim Matte mashita ! " during crucial points in the drama . In context this means something like " Here it comes ! " or " This is what we 've been waiting for ! " and it greets the best-known lines in the play . If American theatergoers followed the same custom , people would yell " Matte mashita ! " when they heard " To be or not to be ... " in Hamlet or " I 'll be back " in a Terminator movie . In American political culture , which displays some of the same affection for formulaic stagecraft , the theatrical highlight of the year is the State of the Union address . Presidents have presented Congress with reports on the state of national affairs since the republic 's beginning , as required by the Constitution . But since Woodrow Wilson established the modern custom of a President 's delivering the report in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the State of the Union address has evolved into the main kabuki-like ceremony in our national politics . Even more than the inauguration , the State of the Union has become a ritual celebration of the glory of the presidency . At an inauguration the excitement surrounding the President is often tempered by the pathos of an old President 's being ushered off the scene . The State of the Union is all about the incumbent . With live TV cameras on them , representatives and even proud senators fidget in a packed House chamber until the President arrives . Foreign diplomats troop in to pay the world 's respects to America 's leader . The military chiefs of staff , in their uniforms , are there ; the justices of the Supreme Court , in their robes ; the members of the Cabinet-minus one , who will take over the government in case of disaster . Honored guests , whose achievements will be praised in the speech , are seated near the President 's spouse . With all the supporting cast in place , the sergeant at arms comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the dais through a crowd of cheering politicians from both parties , many reaching to touch him as he moves by . He stands at the front of the chamber until the cheers finally die-and as soon as they do , the speaker of the House plays his role in the drama . He tells his colleagues that he has the " high privilege and the distinct honor in presenting to you the President of the United States . " As he utters these words , another minutes-long standing ovation begins . On it goes for most of the next hour : the President 's backers cheering the partisan items in his list of proposals , the opposition sitting noticeably still at those moments . The Vice President and the speaker of the House , onstage props visible whenever the President is on camera , try to sit still at all times . Perhaps at the beginning of the speech , perhaps at the end , the President builds toward his Matte mashita ! line . " The state of the union , " he tells the crowd  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived- " is good . " Or perhaps it 's not just " good . " It was good " with room for improvement " according to Gerald Ford as he prepared to leave office in 1977 ; and it was " sound " according to Jimmy Carter the following year . For Bill Clinton in 1995 , speaking after his party had been routed in midterm elections , the state of the union was merely " stronger than it was two years ago . ' By the end of his second term Clinton was ready to declare the state of the union " the strongest it has ever been . " George W. Bush began his State of the Union address one year ago , as bombs fell in Afghanistan , with the speech 's punch line , an artful two-sentence version of the usual one-liner : " As we gather tonight , our nation is at war , our economy is in recession , and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers . Yet the state of our union has never been stronger . " In its substance as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to represent all that is ritualistic and insiderish about modern politics . It is the one major speech a President is sure to deliver each year . Therefore , the day after one address has been given , much of the government gears up to influence the content of the next year 's . The impetus comes in the coded language of Washington : a sentence here about the " high priority " of some new education program , which can be used to defend an extra $100 million in budget requests ; a mention there of a " strong new partnership " with a certain country , which can settle a dispute between the State Department and the Pentagon . Speechwriters dread this speech as they do no other assignment ( or at least I did , when working for Jimmy Carter ) , because so many forces conspire to make it a clotted , committee-bred document whose hidden signals the ordinary listener will completely miss . The closest thing to a memorable line in recent addresses was Bill Clinton 's declaration , in 1996 , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oddity of this situation is that although the State of the Union in the Washington sense has become stylized and removed from everyday American conterns , the real state of the union is of enormous social and cultural interest . Pollsters have known for years that one question above all indicates Americans ' satisfaction with public life and confidence in their leaders-the question that is typically phrased as " In general , do you feel that things in America are moving in the right direction or the wrong direction ? " This is another way of asking whether the state of the union is sound-and when answering the question , people consider a wide range of concerns : How they and their family members are doing , materially and spiritually . What they observe or believe about others . What they think the future will bring . To what extent they feel in control of events , rather than feeling like objects or victims . Some components of this real state of the union are purely private matters , but many others are part of the environment that public life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robustness of the national economic base , the physical safety of citizens , their pride in what the nation stands for-these and many other areas involve politics to some degree . That the components of the real state of the union are complex and subjective does n't mean they ca n't be discussed-and in many cases measured . An attempt to think broadly and originally about these elements of national well-being lies behind this special section . Some of the essays that follow offer specific action plans ; others identify trends to watch . And although they are political in the broadest sense , most do n't bother with comparisons of the Democratic and Republican positions on the subject at hand . The assumption is that in most of the areas under discussion the major-party platforms are essentially fundraising tools or ways to organize blocs of interest groups . This first presentation , in what is planned as an ambitious ongoing effort to measure and assess national wellbeing , is deliberately confined to domestic policy . In part that is a corrective . The national discussion of the past year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight against terrorism , and America 's new place in the world . But the main reason for the concentration on issues within our national borders is our conviction that in the long run , domestic policy matters most . America 's wars have changed the world , mainly for the better , and they have had deep effects on the country 's social and economic institutions . World War II led to official desegregation . The Cold War brought a government-funded scientific establishment . But the signature turning points in American history have mainly been defined by what happened inside the country : immigration , expansion , economic growth , economic difficulties . Over time the domestic strength of a country gives it the material and moral force to play a role in the world . And no President named George Bush need wonder what happens politically to those who forget about the domestic economy . Lasting principles and clear , simple statements do rise above the specifics of any situation . But it is startling how out-of-date and out-of-touch each party 's platform seems when compared with the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme emerges from these essays , it is how disconnected our official politics has become from the realworld , fast-changing , **28;1967;TOOLONG elements that constitute our national welfare . After the recent midterm elections everyone said that the Democrats had suffered because they had run out of good ideas . That was partly true . But the Republicans do n't have much to brag about either . The Democrats have over the past two years stood for the ideas that the Republican tax policy was unfair but not unfair enough to actually vote against , and that the Administration 's strategy toward Iraq was rash but not rash enough to oppose . Meanwhile , the Republican domestic agenda can without too much violence be summarized as : reduce income taxes and eliminate the " death tax . " // Americans have traditionally been vain about their pragmatism . Let the French have their philosophes , the British and the Germans their aristocrats who stand on ceremony . Ours would be the culture of the doer , the tinkerer , the keen observer who noticed what actually worked . In ideal form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty interests but an unshakably realistic bent . Better , he would be a Lincoln : a true visionary who also recognized that the drunken General Grant was the best man for the job . Lincoln , too , issued State of the Union messages , at a time when the existence of the union itself was in question . His second , in 1862 , is the most memorable . " The dogmas of the quiet past , are inadequate to the stormy present " he said . " As our case is new , so we must think anew , and act anew . " We offer these essays in that spirit . // THE REAL STATE OF THE BUDGET Author Affiliation James Fallows it a national correspondent for The Atlantic . // <p>
