Silly though it may seem , people do judge what you 're about based on the tint of your tresses . Learn what messages your mane is sending , plus crib ways you can take advantage of those stereotypes . Photographs by Peter Buckingham bullet the pros and cons of blond Dumb-blond jokes have seen their day . According to Joanna Pitman , author of On Blondes , modern blonds are perceived as powerful , independent , and of course , still plenty sexy : " If you look at the last 50 years , the dominant blond pop icons have gone from being breathy pinup types ( think Marilyn Monroe ) to symbols of strength and self-confidence ( a la Madonna ) . " But blond locks convey a lot more than sexy bravado . For starters , people see blonds as having lots of youthful vitality , and one neuroscientist has suggested that being blond makes you look younger , says Pitman . " Since babies and children tend to have lighter hair than adults do , there 's a subtle correlation between youth and blondness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy and glamorous , both because gold equals money in our collective unconscious and because getting your hair lightened by a professional generally costs a lot . But not all perceptions of blonds are positive : According to a new survey conducted by Harris Interactive of more than 2,400 men and women , women are less likely to trust their significant others alone with a blond than with either a redhead or a brunette . Plus , more disturbingly , blonds can find that they 're not taken seriously at the office . " As an executive coach and managerial training specialist , I 've seen that blonds really do have to try harder in a work environment , " says Duffy Spencer , Ph.D. , a social psychologist in Westbury , New York . HOW TO WORK IT There are times in a flaxen filly 's life-like right before a hot date , a sure-to-be-stud-swarmed party , or any night of carousing-when she 'd do well to max out her glam , sexy , golden glow .

Do n't worry , it wont leave chunks of glitter in your hair ; it will just create a gorgeous light-reflective sheen . Try Philip Pelusi Phyto-Life Glimmer in Pure Gold , $25 , or Brocato Blonde Shimmer Spray , $13 . HOW TO PLAY IT DOWN If you work in a very conservative field and feel that your hair color is preventing a few dinosaurs from taking you seriously or for any situation in which you do n't want your hot-mama mane to distract people from what you have to say ( perhaps a job interview or a presentation to a group of strangers ) , you can temporarily downplay that sexy , glam persona by keeping your hairstyle sleek and simple ( a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't flaunt your sex appeal too much , says Giselle . Another way to prevent a va-va-voom blond mane from looking remotely bimbo-like is to get regular trims , since split ends can make light strands look especially shabby . If you ca n't make it to the salon for a quick snip , try using a smoothing cream to mask your frayed ends . We like Kiehl 's Creme With Silk Groom , $16.50 , and John Frieda Sheer Blonde Dream Creme , $5.50. bullet the brunette files One major plus to being a brown-haired babe ? People tend to trust you . " Brunette is the most prevalent color across cultures , so it 's considered the most fundamental , " says Leatrice Eiseman , director of the Pantone Color Institute and author of Colors for Your Every Mood . " Because of this , and the fact that brown has very earthy associations , brunettes as well as women with black hair are seen as the most truthful , dependable , and natural people . " So it 's not surprising that the majority of women surveyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deep secrets and to be " true best friends . " The survey also found that brunettes are seen as smart and competent : 59 percent of the women polled believe that if a CEO were going to hire only one woman , a brunette would get the job , and most of the men and women surveyed predict the first female president will be brunette . The survey also revealed that people expect brunettes to have happier family lives than other women . The downside of brown ? Being taken for mousy and boring-a perception that persists despite a zillion Hollywood examples to the contrary ( Catherine Zeta-Jones , Salma Hayek , Rosario Dawson ... shall we go on ? ) . Hitched women who were surveyed thought a brunette would be much less likely to turn their husband 's head than a blond . HOW TO WORK IT Going for a new job ? Up for a promotion ? Running for office ? Max out your confidence-inspiring aura by intensifying your hair 's " brunetteness , " suggests Giselle .

HOW TO PLAY IT DOWN Of course you know you 're every bit as sexy as those blond and redheaded babes , but you may need a trick or two to broadcast that when you want to play the seductress . So enhance the mysterious aspect of dark hair , advises Giselle . " By letting your hair down , tousling it a bit , maybe even sticking a flower behind your ear , you can go from executive to exotic . " Use a texturizer like Wella Hair Putty Texturizer , $13.99 , to get the effect . Or wear your tresses in a sloppy-sexy updo , such as the one Giselle saw on the spring runways : Just twist front sections and bobby-pin them back so they 're lying flat against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . bullet the redhead report Fiery tresses attract more attention than blonds or brunettes ... and not just because of the color 's arresting ( think stop signs ) vibrancy . " Red is the rarest hair color , " explains Eiseman . In fact , true redheads constitute only about 1.5 to 2 percent of the world 's population . ( Consider that naturally occurring red hair is almost unheard of in two huge continents , Asia and Africa . ) " So when we do see red hair , it rivets our eyes-and a person with red hair knows she 'll always be noticed , " says Eiseman . Perhaps that 's why redheads have a rep of loving the spotlight and being theatrical , she adds . And red-haired honeys are seen as very racy as well . " Anthropologically , red signifies sexual excitement-as in the flush of a woman 's cheek when she 's aroused , " explains Spencer . " Plus , the fact that red is associated with fire amplifies the perception of sexiness . " ( As in " burning desire " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack . " ) No wonder the Harris Interactive survey found that a majority of men believe redheads have better love lives than blonds and brunettes do and that if women could score any hair color for one day ( or should we assume night ? ) , red would be the hands-down winner . But the fieriness presumption extends beyond the bedroom : On the downside , redheaded chicks are seen as brash and quick to anger , says Eiseman . HOW TO WORK IT These strategies can work red hair into an entrancing , libido-stoking state , so use them when you 're hunk hunting . First , wash your hair with a color-depositing shampoo . " Golden-blond shampoos will add warmth to your hue , while a light auburn will make your red even more intense and deep , " says Giselle .
