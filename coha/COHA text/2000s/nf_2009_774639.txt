1 Increasing military power through restraint // Avoiding an Earthly Hell // We must be judicious in our use of the military . We will fight only when it is in the vital interests of the United States , when our mission is clear , and when the exit strategy is obvious . //  --  Governor George W. Bush // The morning after George W. Bush made his farewell address to the nation , few media outlets took note of it . In fact , the only national paper to mention the 43rd president ? s final speech on its front page was USA Today , and it confined the story to a small box that described another article hidden inside . // America ? s newspapers were focused instead that morning on an airplane that had been taken down from the skies over Manhattan . // TV crews dutifully rushed to the crash site and almost immediately began warning Americans of a grave new danger that would threaten the safety of air travelers for years to come . // Tom Costello of NBC News told Morning Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem and that the crisis had become so grave in the nation ? s capital that cannons were being fired from the end of Reagan National Airport ? s runways every three minutes . // The Times of London weighed in the next morning with a list of solutions government officials were considering to protect British passengers from this growing menace . The Times reported that some leaders had become so desperate that they were resorting to clandestine poisoning , dog attacks , and advanced radar technology . // Coincidentally , a few days earlier the U.S. government had released a report showing that for the first time in aviation history , the United States had gone two years without suffering a single casualty on a commercial air carrier . So just when Americans thought it was safe to once again climb aboard a plane without fear of attack , their confidence was jolted by a rising threat that now stalked the not-so-friendly skies . // We had again met our enemy in the air over New York City , and what was it ? // Birds . // As Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the migratory rise and its effect was being felt on runways across America . That phenomenon had ended in the miraculous water landing on the Hudson River of a US Airways flight . // How ironic it must have seemed to the man who saw his presidency defined by four plane crashes within an hour ? s time that his farewell address to America was eclipsed by yet another plane crash in Manhattan . He must have felt some pride in the fact that the culprits seven years later were not a group of terrorists intent on destroying our way of life , but instead a group of birds trying to avoid a very loud object flying their way . // Predictably , few in the media noted the difference George W. Bush ? s presidency had made to the safety of Americans from a terrorist attack . And while debates might rage for years to come over his approval of harsh interrogation techniques or how long enemy combatants could be locked up , those battles will be waged in law schools like Columbia and NYU , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush had made the protection of American citizens and the prevention of future terror attacks on U.S. soil his top priority . By that measure  --  the most important many apply to a commander in chief  --  the 43rd president did what few Americans thought possible in the weeks following September 11. // He kept Americans safe at home . // While President Bush accomplished that task , conservatives now must assess the cost of achieving that goal and determine how America ? s actions over the past eight years have impacted their movement and , more important , U.S. foreign policy for the next generation . // Before discussing the most effective conservative approach to foreign policy in the future , we should first review how much of a break Mr. Bush ? s approach has been from a conservative foreign policy tradition that was once defined by realism and restraint . // Why did conservative leaders respond to the events of that September morning the way they did ? // Why did the same cautious Republicans who resisted Bill Clinton ? s calls for military missions in Bosnia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Bush ? s preemption doctrine without question ? // And why did so few conservatives criticize Mr. Bush ? s Wilsonian pronouncement that the United States of America would lead a global democratic revolution that would end tyranny itself ? // What exactly were conservatives thinking during Mr. Bush ? s second inaugural address when the Republican president promised the world that U.S. troops would single-handedly bring freedom and peace to all corners of the globe ? // Why did the same Republicans who quoted Colin Powell ? s doctrine to justify their restrained foreign policy in the 1990s treat General Powell ? s cautiousness toward Iraq with such contempt in 2002 ? // And how did a president who promised to conduct a limited , humble foreign policy reside over an administration that critics on both the left and right derided as utopian ? // George W. Bush ? s foreign policy goals in the 2000 presidential campaign were consistent with those of conservatives like myself who were swept into Congress in 1994 . When we controlled the Armed Services Committee during the Clinton administration , prudence and restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s use of military force as undis-ciplined and reckless . As one Foreign Affairs article at the time stated , the Clinton cabinet seemed to view foreign policy as an extension of social work . We conservatives used our majority in Congress to attack that approach as unfocused , undisciplined , and Wilsonian. // For most conservatives , the Cold War was a necessary evil . // U.S. global involvement was the only option available for the containment of the Communist threat . But after the Soviet Union fell , Republicans I served with in Congress believed that the United States should engage in less military adventurism while narrowing its focus abroad . // So cautious were many conservatives involving the use of military power that Democratic policymakers like President Clinton ? s secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , accused GOP leaders of standing in the way of humanitarian missions run by military units . // She was right . We did . And we were proud of it . // No conservative I worked with on the Armed Services Committee in Congress was comfortable with President Clinton ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnia , or Kosovo . We were especially troubled with the Balkans crisis , believing that the lessons of Vietnam taught American leaders not to get involved in civil wars where there were no direct U.S. national security interests . // Conservatives repeatedly pressed Clinton administration officials to state what overriding national interest justified the risking of U.S. casualties . The best answer the White House could provide at the time was that not getting involved in the Balkans civil war would damage our reputation within NATO . // That answer was far from sufficient for most conservatives , who feared getting involved in a three-sided civil war . Obviously , those prudent concerns would fade quickly once a Republican was sworn in as commander-in-chief . // " We are not the world ? s 9-1-1 , " GOP lawmakers would regularly admonish Clinton aides who repeatedly ignored our warnings of an overstretched military . // A NARROW FOCUS . A DEADLY AIM . // Conservatives would also use their perch in the majority to lecture Clinton officials on the finer points of what , for some of us , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctrine . // Named after Reagan ? s secretary of defense , Caspar Weinberger ? s approach to foreign wars was clear , concise , and restrictive . It was framed by the bloody disasters of Vietnam and Beirut , in which two truck bombs struck separate buildings that killed hundreds of U.S. Marines . // Secretary Weinberger said American combat troops should only be deployed when : // it is vital to U.S. national interests // our troop commitment is full and overwhelming // the objectives for our troops are clearly defined // leaders will be willing to reassess constantly troop levels and end goals of the operation // Americans support the war before engagement // U.S. combat troops are sent in only as a last resort // Weinberger ? s guidelines were taken as gospel by many conservatives throughout the 1980s and outlasted his time in office . When troops rolled into Kuwait in 1991 for the First Gulf War , former Weinberger aide Colin Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs . // General Powell ? s statements at the start of those combat operations showed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // When asked to describe his military strategy against the Iraqi army , the general was blunt . // " First we ? re going to cut it off , then we ? re going to kill it . " // And that is exactly what Powell ? s military machine did . // After the Gulf War , General Powell outlined his own guidelines for U.S. troop deployment . Like Weinberger before him , Powell argued that American troops should go to war only as a last resort . But when we did engage militarily , the force applied should be decisive . // " We don ? t want a fair fight " was Powell ? s mantra. // While most Republicans cheered the general ? s approach , a strand within the conservative movement  --  dubbed " neoconservatives "  --  sided with liberal humanitarian hawks like Secretary of State Albright , who were more liberal with the use of American troops overseas in the cause of " limited " wars . // General Powell would remain at odds with both groups . // After leaving the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled one memorable exchange with Albright , who became exasperated with the general ? s reluctance to send Americans to war . // " What ? s the point of having this superb military you ? re always talking about , " Albright asked Powell , " if we can ? t use it ? " // Powell remembered later that he " almost had an aneurysm. " // After collecting his thoughts , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs patiently explained to the secretary of state that " American GIs are not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board . " // The New York Times later quoted Secretary Albright as saying that her aggressive worldview was shaped by Britain ? s appeasement of Adolf Hitler at Munich . Because of that experience , when it came to troop deployment , her first instinct was to " go in . " But because Colin Powell and the band of brothers he served with in Vietnam continued to carry the scars of that failed war , their first instinct had always been caution . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a popular governor from a large Southern state . His view on how America should engage in world affairs was clear and restrictive , and owed much to Colin Powell . // During a presidential debate with Al Gore , Jim Lehrer asked Governor George W. Bush whether the United States should engage in nation building . The Texas governor ? s response was every bit as indignant as Colin Powell ? s retort to Secretary Albright. // " Maybe I ? m missing something here , " Governor Bush shot back at Lehrer , " but we should encourage people who live in those lands to build their own nations . " Bush continued , " Our military is meant to fight and win wars . And when it gets overextended , its morale drops . " // The 2000 GOP nominee then gave Americans a condensed version of the Weinberger-Powell Doctrine : " We must be judicious in our use of the military . We will fight only when it is in the vital interests of the United States , when our mission is clear , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear a description of conservative foreign policy as that that existed at the turn of the century . // And then came September 11. //
