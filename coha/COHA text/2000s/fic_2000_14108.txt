Will was a big tranquilizer , not an irritant like we had thought life and existence had to be We even stopped moving so much . And Will worked steady , at various kinds of jobs , but he worked steadily at working . Mom stopped dancing in the chorus line  --  she would n't ever move to New York City and get discovered at The Apollo like the stars do  --  and it had something to do with her being a New Negro Woman  --  some kind of a holdover from the 1920s Marcus Garvey Black Uplift Movement .

He was an avid fan . Will was really my stepfather , sort of , though he and my mother never got married , for their own reasons that they never told me , though they did live together from the late thirties until the early fifties . Back in those days there was a real social stigma about men and women living together outside of wedlock . But we moved a lot in the early years , around that big , old , ugly , dirty city , so we were there , then we were gone . Sometimes , I was told to introduce Will to my friends and the neighbors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomer , or just a friend of the family , until we moved to our final place , where we stayed from 1941 to 1953 , when the big breakup came .

Yeah , he really did know baseball . We saw the Negro League teams  --  the Kansas City Monarchs , the Homestead Braves , the Philadelphia All-Stars  --  at least that 's what I think their names were . They were fierce rivals and played exciting , incendiary ball . Remember , this was before the time of TV . The first players I saw kicking sand on a black umpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackie Jones , " or " Brown Bennie Blackwell , " or " Slick Sonny Boy Scott . " Of course those were not their real names  --  I 've forgotten those  --  but their names had that type of colorful , suggestive alliteration . Like the Harlem Globetrotters whom I saw later , some of the black baseball players had specialty clown skills . Some shagged flies and grounders during the exhibition period with huge gloves , others did base-running routines or challenged horses to footrace them , and others did various entertainment bits . But the rivalry between the teams was fierce . I have seen bench clearing brawls at the black games more than once , when my mother would cover her eyes and Will and I would be screaming for an early death to the ump Will would come home from the railroad or stock shipper 's job and pick us up and we were off to " Play ball !

She said that that day I had become one of the most fortunate people in America because Jackie Robinson had been admitted to major league baseball . I did n't tell her that I did n't know who he was . Or that I was completely dumb to the significance of any relevance of Jackie Robinson to baseball Later , I asked Will about these questions . And he took a big drag on his Camel and said ( Light on WILL ) p. 65 WILL Ernie it 's the beginning of the end . ( Light off WILL ) ERNIE And I did n't believe him any more than I did when he returned from VJ-Day , saying that the world would be destroyed in nine months or so , because the U.S. of A. had the " at-tom " bomb and an itchy trigger finger ( he was an artillery man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or , later , when he stopped trading Mickey Spillane-type mystery stories , cowboy shoot-'em-ups , science fiction , and comics with me because I was reading a little George Orwell and Thorsten Veblen , which meant that I was becoming a geek or a Communist , or worseboth .
