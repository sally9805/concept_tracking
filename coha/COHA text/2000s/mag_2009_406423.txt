PAMELA FIORI Editor in chief A HOUSE IN THE HAMPTONS . As an expression , it has a nice ring to it , not unlike " a villa in Tuscany , " " a cottage in the Cotswolds " or , more lavishly , " a chteau in the Loire " or " a castle in Spain . " All promise escape , remoteness and tranquillity . They do n't always deliver . Zealous overdevelopment , massive influxes of tourists and traffic-jammed highways are frequently obstacles on the road to paradise . Photograph : At ease in Sag Harbor . <br> PHOTOGRAPH BY COLT GIVNER In the case of the Hamptons , the storied stretch of villages and beaches on Long Island from Westhampton to Montauk Point , that road is the Long Island Expressway ( also known as the LIE or 495 ) . There are other ways to get there , and insiders jealously guard every detour , back road and alternate route . But the LIE is still the main artery leading to the heart of the Hamptons , which starts in Southampton and ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on your way , give or take a bottleneck or two . I 've been going to the Hamptons , save for a two-year hiatus , since 1980 . That 's almost thirty years . I 've seen countless changes , not all of them good , yet it remains one of the most uncannily beautiful areas on the East Coast  --  and , yes , for many , a paradise . It is not , however , without its detractors . For everyone who rhapsodizes about the Hamptons , you can find someone else who reviles it . Emotions run high on the subject , often from people who knew it as it once was and have moved away in frustration or , if they are locals , have felt shut out by the newcomers . It 's a familiar refrain . In the beginning , the Hamptons ( also called the South Fork or the East End ) was a community of potato farmers and commercial fishermen . In its infancy as a resort area and a weekend retreat , the Hamptons attracted bohemians ( the writers Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such artists as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning ) , who gravitated toward the freewheeling East Hampton , and the Establishment ( old money and high finance ) , which preferred the propriety of Southampton . Eventually , the hamlets that lay between these two main towns  --  primarily Water Mill , Bridgehampton , Sag Harbor and Sagaponack  --  brought them closer geographically , but never the twain shall meet . Southampton and East Hampton are as opposite in sensibility today as they ever were . If I can draw a comparison , Southampton is akin to Nantucket or Palm Beach , while East Hampton is a little more like Martha 's Vineyard or Miami . In the past few years , the area has seen far too many houses razed and replaced by bloated McMansions owned by overnight billionaires . Today , for reasons we know all too well , some of those humongous houses are up for sale or in danger of foreclosure . " Hmm , " we thought . " Now 's the time to revisit the Hamptons . " We went there in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has always been in evidence : graceful homes , both modest and grand ; small towns that have retained their flavor and traditions ( even if they had to fight to do so ) ; fields of farmland ; meadows where horses graze undisturbed ; natural ponds and well-tended gardens ; and miles and miles of wide , sandy and welcoming beaches available to everyone . Since this is a home issue , we wanted to show examples of residences  --  and residents  --  with charm , some of them wildly eccentric . Does the name Grey Gardens leap to mind ? If you ever saw the 1975 cinema verit documentary by the brothers Albert and David Maysles , you know what " wildly eccentric " means . The dilapidated house is a metaphor for its inhabitants , " Big Edie " and " Little Edie " Beale , a mother-and-daughter team who were the improbable descendants of the blue-blooded Bouviers ( as in Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy and Lee Bouvier Radziwill ) . The film , now a cult classic , is the basis for an HBO movie that debuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drew Barrymore as Little Edie . If you remember Jessica Lange from Tootsie , The Postman Always Rings Twice , Frances and King Kong , her first screen appearance , you will hardly recognize her in this role , so wizened and haggard is she . But as you can see on our cover and in the profile on page 84 , in real life she is as gorgeous as ever . Accompanying that story is a touching memoir by Big Edie 's grandson Bouvier Beale Jr . That 's about as offbeat as we get in this issue . The mood is a lot tamer at the de Guardiolas ' Shingle-style manse in Southampton ; Kim Heirston and Richard Evans 's bayside bungalow in Bridgehampton ; and the Jacka family 's house in the village of Sag Harbor , where they live year-round . The owners talk not only about their abodes but also about some of their favorite places in the Hamptons . In our " Traveler 's Notebook " and " Design Trends " pages , you 'll find still more resources . Finally , National Book Award-winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both longtime Hamptons residents , exchange views on a number of subjects , including the most precious resources of all . I mean , of course , the natural ones , which are where all roads to paradise begin  --  and end . I 'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR FROM YOU .
