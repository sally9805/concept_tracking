12 ways to get more miles out of your legs , plus proof that trekking poles work and cotton does n't // Right before our eyes , her knee swelled like a balloon . We were deep in Wyoming 's Wind River Mountains , 14 miles from the nearest trailhead , and a rapid , joint-pounding descent had taken its toll . My hiking partner 's right knee , the doctor said later , had with one awkward step exploded into a mass of strained ligaments . The reason : Her knee was n't strong enough to support a heavy pack on a rugged hike . Knees take a beating in every sport this side of billiards , but backpacking especially strains that allimportant joint . Walking up a slope that has about the same incline as a stairway puts three to four times your body weight on your knees-and that 's without a pack . Hiking downhill places even more jarring strain on the knees . The good news is that you can prevent chronic pain and injury with pretrip and on-the  --  trail maintenance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . 1 Schedule " break-in " time for your knees before each trip by taking short hikes with a loaded pack ( see " Survival Of The Fittest , " April 2001 ) . While the regimen for getting your knees trail tough will vary depending on your fitness level , a training rule of thumb is that you should work up to carrying 10 pounds more in your pack than you intend to carry on the trail . Add weight in 10-pound increments while dayhiking half the distance of the longest day of your upcoming trip . 2 Invest in a comfortable pair of hiking boots that provide good ankle support , which helps stabilize the knee . ( See " Hiking Boots , " March 2001 , for tips on buying boots that meet your needs. ) 3 Stretch your leg muscles before shouldering your pack . Once you 've hiked for 10 minutes and your muscles are warmed up , stop and stretch again . 4 Practice proper pack shouldering . Brace the pack on your thigh , then slip one arm into its shoulder strap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better yet , ask a partner to hoist your pack high . 5 Strengthen your leg muscles . Focus on the inner thighs and hamstrings , because if those muscles are weak , so are your knees . You do n't need a weight machine , but a set of ankle weights ( 5-pounders are a good start ) is helpful . To work the inner thighs : With ankle weights on , lie on your back , then lift your right leg while keeping your left leg bent and your left foot on the floor ( see illustration ) . With your right knee flexed slightly , rotate your foot out and tighten your inner thigh , flexing the muscle . Now do the left leg . For the hamstrings : Stand and lift one weighted foot behind you until the lower leg is at 90 degrees and hold for at least 5 seconds ; then lower the foot slowly . Repeat each exercise a minimum of 10 to 15 times . 6 Lean your upper body slightly forward when you backpack , especially when going uphill . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting less stress on your ACL ( anterior cruciate ligament ) and more evenly dispersing weight between your quads and hamstrings. 7 Consult with a foot specialist about custom-made orthotic devices . They can be expensive , but may help to alleviate joint pain caused by anatomical misalignments . 8 Avoid maneuvers on the trail that put extra stress on your knees , such as full squats and long-drop steps off ledges . Pick your footing carefully on rocky terrain . Interrupt long downhill stretches with frequent rest breaks . Also , take shorter steps going downhill , make your own mini-switchbacks on wide trails , and dump unneeded water before heading downhill . 10 Use trekking poles to reduce impact on your knees ( see " Pole Science " on page 26 ) . 11 Pack a light load , leaving unnecessary gear and extras at the trailhead. 12 Plan knee-friendly hikes . If steep hills and big-mileage days leave you weak-kneed , find shorter hikes on flatter terrain , and take more frequent rest breaks .

Tilton Sidebar Cotton : The Whole Truth Sidebar Backpackers worth their weight Sidebar in gorp know not to wear cotton clothing Sidebar in the backcountry ( except in the desert , where it helps keep you cool ) . Here are the statistics . Sidebar Your body loses heat three times faster in dry cotton than in wool , nylon , or acrylic fibers . Compared to wearing polypropylene , you lose body heat six times faster in cotton . Because wet cotton dries so slowly , it whisks away precious body heat nine times faster than damp wool or synthetic materials . Source Basic Essentials : Hypothermia , by William W. Forgey , M.D. Sidebar Women , Watch Your Step ! Sidebar Female knees are more prone to injury . Sidebar If you 're a woman , you have even more reason to protect your knees . Recent studies have proven that women are more prone to knee injury than men are . The reason is partly anatomical . A woman 's wider pelvis angles the thigh bones inward more acutely , making the knees a bit less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have less restraining tissue ( ligaments , tendons , muscles ) - the stuff responsible for providing stability in a knee . Pivoting the knee under stress ( like carrying a pack on uneven terrain ) provides the greatest opportunity for getting sidelined . In addition to following all the above recommendations , women can improve their odds of avoiding injury by strengthening their quads for better knee stability . Try leg extensions : Sit on a table or some other flat surface with your lower legs dangling and , with a 5-pound weight attached to each ankle , extend one leg at a time to a straight position and then return it to hanging . Repeat 10 to 15 times on each side , or until your legs tire . - Buck Tilton // <p>
