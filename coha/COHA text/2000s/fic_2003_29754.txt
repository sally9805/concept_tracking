Elaines late . Stone Barrington sipped his third Wild Turkey and resisted the basket of hot sourdough bread that the waiter had just placed on the table . Callie was to have been there an hour and a half ago , and he was very , very hungry . Shed called from the airport to say that she was on the ground and on her way , but that had been an hour ago . It just did nt take that long to get to Elaines from Teterboro Airport , where her bosss jet landed . He glanced at his watch : Hed give her another three minutes , and then he was ordering . He had been looking forward to seeing her . Theyd spent some very pleasant time together in Palm Beach a few months before , on the yacht of his client Thad Shames . She was Shamess majordomoassistant , cook , social secretary , whatever he neededand she moved when Shames moved , back and forth between Palm Beach and New York . In New York , she had been living with Stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a menu , Stone said to Michael , the headwaiter . Giving up on her ? Michael asked . I am . If I drink any more without some food in my stomach , youre going to have to send me home in a wheelbarrow . Michael laughed and placed a menu before him . Dinos not coming ? He should be here in a while ; he said he had to work late . He opened the menu , and Michael stood ready , pad in hand . When Stone was this hungry , everything looked good . Hed meant to have fish ; hed gained three pounds , and he need to get it off , but now he was too hungry.Ill have a Caesar salad and the osso buco , he said , and a bottle of the Amerone . Michael jotted down the order , and as he reached for the menu , Stone looked up to see Callie breezing through the front door . He rose to meet her . She looked wonderful , as usual , in an Armani pantsuit . She gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up on you , Stone said . I just ordered . Michael handed her a menu , but she handed it back . Im sorry , I cant stay for dinner , she said . Stone looked at her , stupefied . She had kept him waiting for an hour and a half , and now she wasnt going to have dinner ? Would you like a drink , Callie ? Michael asked . She shook her head . No time , Michael . You still want dinner , Stone ? Yes , please , Stone replied . Michael retreated . So ? Stone asked . So what ? Callie replied . Is there something you want to tell me ? He wanted an apology and an explanation , but he got neither . Stone , Callie said , looking at the tablecloth and playing with a matchbook . She did nt continue . Im right here , he replied . Have been , for an hour and a half . God , this is hard , she said . Maybe a drink would help . No , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at this hour ? he asked . Back in Palm Beach . Stone wasnt terribly surprised . Thad Shames , a computer software billionaire , had a peripatetic lifestyle , and Callie was , after all , at his beck and call . First of all , Im sorry Im late , she said . I had to go by the house and pick up some things . Stone looked around ; she wasnt carrying anything . Theyre in the car , she said . What did you have to pick up ? he asked . Some things . My things . Stone blinked . Are you going somewhere ? Back to Palm Beach . I told you . Stone was baffled . Callie ... She took a deep breath and interrupted him . Thad and I are getting married this weekend . Stone was drinking his bourbon , and he choked on it . I know you did nt expect this , she said . For that matter , neither did I. Its just happened the past couple of weeks . She had been gone for two weeks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you perfectly serious about this ? Perfectly , and Id appreciate it if you did nt try to talk me out of it . That was exactly what he wanted to try . I wouldnt dream of it , he said . If thats what you want . Its good , Stone . It isnt like with you and me , but that could never last . Why not ? Stone demanded , stung . Oh , its been great . I arrive in town , move in with you ; we go to Elaines and the theater , and around . We fuck our brains out for a week or two , then I go back . That was exactly what they did , he reflected , but he wasnt going to admit it . I thought we had more than that going , he said . Oh , men always think that , she said , exasperated . There are things Thad can give me , things I need , things you cant . . . She left it hanging . Cant afford ? he asked . I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion dollars , but I did nt think Thad was , anymore , not after his new stock offering collapsed , and with the way the market has been . Its true , she said . Thad was hurt badly . Now he s only worth three billion . What a blow , Stone said . Its not the money , she said . All right , maybe thats part of it . God knows , Ill never have to draw another anxious breath . Not about money , anyway . Wont you try and understand ? What is there to understand ? Im out , Thads in . Its your life ; I cant tell you how to live it . If only youd . . . She stopped . Stone did nt want to hear the rest , anyway . I think its a little late for if only , he said . Clearly , youve thought this out , Im not going to try to talk you out of it . Thank God for that , she muttered , half to herself . They sat silently for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and headed for the door , nearly knocking down Dino , who had chosen that moment to walk in . Dino turned and watched her rush out the door , then he walked over to Stones table and sat down . Dino Bacchetti had been Stones partner when he was still on the NYPD ; now he ran the detective squad at the Nineteenth Precinct . So , he said , I see you managed to fuck up another relationship . Jesus , Dino , I did nt do anything , Stone said . Dino motioned to Michael for a drink . Thats usually the problem , he said . The drink was placed before him , and he sipped it . You want some dinner , Dino ? Michael asked . Whatever he s having , Dino replied . Caesar salad and the osso buco ? Good . He turned to Stone . After a while , women expect you to do something . Shes marrying Thad Shames . Dinos eyebrows shot up . No shit ? Well , Ill admit , I did nt see that one coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he s only worth three billion now . Poor guy ; couple months , hell be living on the street . Still , he got the girl . Do nt rub it in . Its what I do , Dino explained . Stones cellphone , clipped to his belt , began to vibrate . Now what ? he said to nobody in particular . Hello ? Stone , its Bill Eggers . Bill was the managing partner of Wood-man &; Weld , the prestigious law firm for which Stone did unprestigious jobs . Yeah , Bill . You sound down . Just tired ; whats up ? You got anything heavy on your plate right now ? Nothing much . Good ; theres a guy coming to see you tomorrow morning at nine , with some work . Do whatever he says . Suppose he wants me to kill somebody . If this guy wanted somebody killed , hed do it himself . His name is John Bartholomew , and he s major , in his way . Ill be glad to see him . You got a passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . Good . Youre going to need it . Eggers hung up . Elaine came over and pulled up a chair . Callie left in a hurry , she said . I guess you fucked it up again . Do nt you start , Stone said .
