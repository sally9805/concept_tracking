We can now position ourselves to take advantage of emerging opportunities . // I KEEP A PICTURE OF MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER Addie Hawkins in the room where I write to hold the concept of work in perspective . When I describe my writing-talking life as " hard " or " stressful , " I 'm reminded that my great-grandmother was a maid who cleaned White folks ' houses and sent five children to college with her earnings . Almost half of African-American women were maids in 1940 . Until the 1960 's that was the way we were generally stereotyped-as the servant , the mammy , the sister on the Aunt Jemima box , cooking and cleaning for White folks . To be sure , we 've come a long way , sisters . The descendants of women who dusted knickknacks and cooked dinners for two families are now designing computer software and managing multimillion-dollar corporations . Much of our progress is due to our increased educational presence . In 1960 just 22 percent of Black women completed high school ; by the end of the century 74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed college . But we still do n't hold our share of advanced degrees-we 're less than 1 percent of the 43,000 who received doctorates in 1998 . Our progress in higher education and in the workplace is threatened by attacks on affirmative action , the policy that opened doors to African-Americans beginning in the midsixties . In Atlanta , for example , no Black entrepreneur had a contract with the city before 1975 , when Mayor Maynard Jackson initiated an aggressive " minority business set-aside " program . Now Mayor Bill Campbell must defend the program against a lawsuit by a conservative legal group that 's claiming reverse discrimination . Similar fights are slated for Texas , Michigan and Florida , and the conservative judicial climate makes them uphill battles . Is affirmative action still necessary ? With the best jobs held mostly by Whites , a policy that says that when two people are equally qualified the person belonging to the underrepresented group should be selected still makes sense . Despite these challenges , this is an exciting time . As the following pages illustrate , with technology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can position ourselves to take advantage of a host of opportunities . Our generations task is to improve on the accomplishments of those who came before us and capture our foremothers ' tenacity and bold spirit and combine them with the opportunities for education , technological development and global exposure , so that we 'll be sure to flourish in the twenty-first century labor market . THE HOT JOBS With a vibrant economy projected job expansion at 14 percent over the decade and women 's share of the labor force rising , we will see increased room for growth in the labor market . Technology and health occupations are among the hottest for the future , because these industries are generating a large number of previously unavailable jobs . Positions requiring an associate degree or higher level of education are projected to account for 44 percent of all growth . White-collar and service jobs are also growing more rapidly and these occupations will employ a larger share of the workforce in the next ten years . More than half of the 4 million service-industry openings that will be created in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and local government hospitals . The employment opportunities in this chart represent a range of educational requirements , with a mix of skills and salaries . The average young person has had nine jobs by age 32 ; and the average adult will have a series of careers , not just a single job , by retirement . If you 're entering the labor market or merely contemplating a change , prepare and then follow your passion ; whether your aspiration is hot or not , you 're sure to prosper . D THE NEW EMPLOYER IN 1979 FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES EMPLOYED 18 million people , or about 20 percent of the workforce . By 1999 they employed about 11 million , or just 10 percent of workers . Large corporations are n't the economic engine they once were , so fewer workers will get the benefits-pensions , investment plans , health benefits , generous vacation and family leaves-that come with " good " Fortune 500 jobs . Small businesses now employ about half the nation 's private-sector workforce , and they 're less likely to offer ample benefits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freelance , you must negotiate higher pay and create your own benefits package . // Downsizing has also created opportunities for sister entrepreneurs and consultants with the outsourcing of a range of goods and services . But you must still network and offer the professionalism that keeps you in the mix . Organizations like the National Black MBA Association , Inc. ( www.NBMBAA.org ) , and the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women 's Clubs , Inc. ( www.NANBPWC.org ) , provide women entrepreneurs with networking opportunities . 4 Sidebar HOW TO THRIVE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY In 1983 Time magazine named the computer the machine of the year , and our work lives have n't been the same since . Technology has freed us to telecommute , communicate internationally for the cost of a local phone call and create " virtual offices " that cut business overhead costs . But we are embracing technology at a slower pace than others . While 51 percent of all White households have at least one computer , just 29 percent of African-American households and 20 percent of all Hispanic households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-first century , this is what must be done : 1 . Expand your knowledge . View education as a lifelong process . Take advantage of every learning opportunity , from corporate-sponsored training to courses at community colleges . Globalization and technological advancements have increased the need for classes in languages , computer technology and business and created a demand for teachers in these areas . 2 . Master technology . Make it your business to become computer-literate to stay competitive in the marketplace . 3 . Learn a language . The marketplace is global , and those who know other languages will have advantages . Try community colleges and language centers for conversational Spanish , French and Japanese . 4 . See opportunities in trends . When you hear that the babyboom generation is aging , understand that this will create job openings in health . When incomes are rising , more people will be buying luxury goods . Trends are chances that you can exploit . 5 . Embrace your passion . Jobs in the computer industry are among the fastest growing . But if you want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If your heart is n't in a job , you probably wo n't do well at it . 6 . Have a Plan B. Follow your heart , but have a way to pay your rent . 7 . Polish your presentation . First impressions count , no matter how talented you are . Be pleasant . Keep your word . Be flexible . These tips are n't on job descriptions , but they may make a difference in whether you get an offer or the brush-off. 8 . Document discrimination . We 've come a long way from stark segregation , but discrimination may still be a factor in hiring and promotion decisions . Document incidents you think are discriminatory and complain . Call the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at ( 800 ) 669-4000 , or visit their Web site at www.eeoc.gov. 9 . Be your own boss . Entrepreneurship on the side is becoming the job option of choice for many workers . For some , this offers a safe transition between full-time work and self-employment . Make sure you are prepared and have a solid business plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company role . The workplace of the future will have less hierarchy and more " team " organization . And each worker will have to bring a creative , entrepreneurial mind-set to the team , constantly increasing expertise and making a contribution to the company 's bottom line .
