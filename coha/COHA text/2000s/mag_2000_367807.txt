GOOD NEWS <P> HIV HELP More hope on the AIDS front . A new study shows that adding the immune-system stimulant interleukin-2 to the usual brew of AIDS drugs can more than double T-cell counts in patients infected with HIV . Plus , in a surprise for researchers , blood levels of HIV dropped slightly too . Both findings are decidedly encouraging , though it 's too early to know for sure whether revving up T cells this way will delay the onset of full-blown AIDS . And there 's a price : the interleukin-2 was injected twice daily for five days every eight weeks , during which time patients felt feverish , achy and generally lousy . <P> FAMILY AFFAIRS After all the talk about whether birth order can influence a child 's personality , researchers report that whether a child is born first , last or somewhere in the middle has no bearing whatsoever on at least one trait : IQ . Size of the family makes no difference either . What 's more likely to influence intelligence ? Other factors in a child 's environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> BAD NEWS <P> THE PILL Do n't base your decision about whether to take birth-control pills solely on this finding , but an analysis of 40 years of data shows that taking low-dose estrogen formulations nearly doubles the odds of suffering a stroke . Worse , women on high-dose estrogen face a nearly threefold increased risk . A worry to be sure , but not a big one : the odds of a stroke among women of reproduction age are tiny to begin with  --  about 5 in 100,000 . <P> A MOUTHFUL Folks with problematic heart valves  --  those that leak , are too thick , too thin or have been replaced altogether  --  should be prescribed antibiotics before particularly bloody dental procedures so that bacteria in the mouth do n't stray to the heart . Are doctors giving patients the proper pills ? A study shows that while 90% of folks with artificial heart valves are prescribed antibiotics , only 60% of those with less extreme conditions are getting them . And unbelievably , 25% of people with a perfectly normal heart are given antibiotics . Advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't take antibiotics . If it does , demand them . <P>  --  By Janice M.
