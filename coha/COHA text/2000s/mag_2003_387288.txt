The growth of house church Christianity in the world 's most populous nation is bound to change the world as we know it . <p> CHINA IS IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING CHRISTIANIZED . That does not mean that all Chinese will become Christian , or even that a majority will . But at the present rate of growth in the number of Christians in the countryside , in the cities , and especially within China 's social and cultural establishment , it is possible that Christians will constitute 20 to 30 percent of China 's population within three decades . If that should happen , it is almost certain that a Christian view of the world will be the dominant worldview within China 's political and cultural establishment , and possibly also within senior military circles . <p> What do I mean by a " Christian view of the world " ? Of course , there is no uniform " Christian view " on many domestic and international issues . Christians differ with one another over political and social questions . But what I mean is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " derives from Augustine 's calling in his major work , The City of God , for a profound sense of restraint , justice , and order in the wielding of state power . <p> Both Britain and the U.S. have possessed this at the heights of their imperial power and influence , and the U.S. still possesses it . This does not , naturally , mean that national interests are placed aside in favor of the international community . No nation has even been totally unselfish in employing its national power . But some nations have been unusually generous and mindful of a real responsibility  --  in effect before God  --  to act wisely , justly , and generously in the international arena . <p> Though the perception of imperial power strategy among the nations of the world in the past 200 years has rested on what might be called the " realist " framework of international affairs , there has , within the two great Anglo-Saxon empires of Britain and the U.S. , been a strong component of human rights idealism . This would also come within the domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The U.S. since World War II has certainly thought of itself as bound to proceed with such a duty to the world . America 's continuing concern for religious and political freedom all over the world has often been carried on regardless of realpolitik assessments of its contribution to American power interests . Though America 's diplomatic leadership has not been specifically Christian in recent decades , it has , always in public , and usually in private , spoken as though this " Augustinian " obligation applied to it . Though such a worldview is also rooted in Judaism , as Christianity itself is , it would not be amiss to call this sense of national obligation a " Christian worldview . " A More Responsible Power ... <p> THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF CHINA is likely to be concurrent with China 's emergence as a global superpower . A Christianized China may spend less time thinking of ways to outmaneuver and neutralize the U.S. than the military strategists of the current regime . This is not because they will have ceased to be patriotic , but because they will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just as the U.S. emerged into a benevolent global imperial role after World War II and the decline of the British Empire , it is not implausible that a Christianized China , now an emergent global power , might find itself wanting to take on some of the burdens that the U.S. has carried for the past five decades . It is also possible that , for a period of time , the U.S. and China might find themselves sharing a common worldview on many thorny questions of international affairs , and in some ways cooperating closely to resolve them . <p> For example , a Christianized China would be unlikely to consent to any resolution of Middle East problems that allows for the elimination of Israel as a Jewish state . A Christianized China would seek to make the world safe for Christian missionary endeavor , especially within the Islamic domains . I do not think that China would try to bully its way into the hearts of Muslims in the way Western imperial powers tried to do into the hearts of Chinese in the nineteenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Christianity , at least initially , will be strongly evangelical in flavor . It was without question evangelicalism that was the main impetus behind both Britain 's abolition of the slave trade within its own domains in 1833 and its insistence on trying to eliminate it internationally throughout much of the remainder of the nineteenth century . <p> Just as Britain 's Royal Navy operated a successful global interdiction of the slave trade in the first six decades of the nineteenth century , a Christianized China might find itself eager to ensure international law and order wherever it had the capability of doing so : suppression of piracy on the South China Sea , for example , or in the Straits of Malacca . A Christianized China may also find itself in close cooperation with the rest of the world in the suppression of terrorism , or making a more conscientious effort than hitherto to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ... Or an Emerging Menace ? <p> HOWEVER , the possibility of China 's emergence as an aggressive global superpower menace should not be discounted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the first significant Western contacts took place through the Jesuits , China has turned aggressively xenophobic after a long period of seeming to digest Western trade , science , technology and ideas . The Boxer Rebellion of 1900 was the most violent and fanatical of the episodes . In the 1920s , nationalistic anti-Westernism fueled strikes , protests , and a lingering antipathy to Western importations like Christianity . The years between China 's entry into the Korean War in 1950 and Henry Kissinger 's visit of 1971 were another period when China closed in upon itself in great hostility to the major Western power of the day , the United States . <p> More recently , the Chinese mobs that stoned the U.S. embassy in Beijing and burned down the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in 1999 after the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade indicated that there are thriving grass roots of populist nationalism ( even if the government organized the buses to drive the demonstrators to the embassy ) . <p> Nor are these sentiments limited to the grass roots . Michael Pillsbury , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's military , has shown that among China 's major military think tanks there is a deep-seated strategic speculation about the country 's potential to become a supreme global military superpower in the current century . In China Debates the Future Security Environment , Pillsbury , who has personally known many of the Chinese theorists about whom he writes , reports how Chinese strategists have devised a system for denominating the powers of great nations called Comprehensive National Power . This system factors in matters like economic strength , military technology , national will , national weakness , and so forth . Pillsbury says that Beijing 's prestigious military think tank , the Academy of Military Science , estimates that China 's CNP will have matched that of the U.S. by the year 2020 . Another Chinese think tank , notes Pillsbury , which we have come across a few times already and which has generally had a much more pro-Western bent to it , the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , has predicted that by the decade 2020-2030 , the U.S. will grasp that China is about to overtake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown is , regardless of how realistic these predictions of China 's rise to prominence may or may not be , Chinese strategic planners are currently envisioning the probable emergence of China as the number-one global superpower within a matter of decades . <p> It is certainly conceivable that , in the wake of a major economic collapse in China , or perhaps some military confrontation over Taiwan , China 's political leadership could lurch in the direction of a dangerous and vengeful nationalism . Democracy  --  But Not So Fast <p> WILL CHINA EVOLVE into a political democracy ? Will China permit genuine freedom of conscience ? It 's certainly desirable . The U.S. has no major security concerns with nations that practice freedom of religion . A China that is accountable to its own people through the political process is far less likely to lie  --  as the government did in the early stages of the SARS epidemic  --  or to be an international bully . <p> So how will China get from the one-party political dictatorship of today to the desirable multi-party democracy of tomorrow ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extreme violence that has often characterized regime change in China . Chinese , who have never enjoyed the experience of a functioning political democracy , are n't really sure that they have the needed self-discipline to make it work . They are n't sure if they have the needed civic virtues that all political democracies need in some measure . Can you have a viable democracy if you still have massive corruption ? Can you deal with corruption effectively without first constructing a system for implementing due process under the rule of law ? Which comes first , civic virtue or a new legal system ? How do you ensure that you have a decent legal system without a solid core of people who are , well , virtuous ? <p> In this context , China 's house church Christians are uniformly patriotic and cautious : They do not want to see a breakup of China by the creation , for example , of an independent Tibet . They do not want to see a Taiwan that has declared sovereign independence from China ( but they also do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see religious and political freedom come to China , but in an evolutionary , reformist process , not through political violence against the authorities . <p> Yuan Zhiming , whose documentary The Soul of China has had a major impact among Chinese intellectuals in both China and the U.S. , does not believe that political activism in and of itself is the best way to change China into a more humane society , not to mention a functioning political democracy . Yuan , both through The Soul of China and his most recent documentary , The Cross , hopes to demonstrate in an intellectually convincing way not just the compatibility , but the affinity , of traditional Chinese culture with Christian revelation . <p> Despite their designation by China 's Communist Party as political oppositionists , many of China 's Christian dissidents are only seeking moderate reforms . Unlike Wei Jingsheng and others , their primary goal is not to overturn Communism . Many do not believe China will be ready for any transition to political democracy in the next ten years . Some worry about the possible effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I think the next ten years is the best time for Christianizing China , " says Zhang Boli , one Chinese student leader on the " most wanted list " after Tiananmen Square who is now a Christian clergyman . " If things are too open it is not good . Under hardship the Chinese church will be healthy . I am concerned that some day when things are totally open there will be corruption . " Zhang , like Yuan , has seen some aspects of Christianity in the U.S. that have flourished in conditions of total religious freedom . And he does n't like them : egotistical name-building by some clergy , an affluent lifestyle that pays no attention to the poor or to those who are suffering , a society plagued in some areas by theft and violence while others remain safe and uninterested in their suburban homes . Other Christian leaders are similarly cautious about desiring any regime change in China within the short-term future . Changing the Face of Christendom <p> ALSO WORTH NOTING is how the emergence of China as a Christianized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if China 's Protestant Christian population is close to 70 million , it would make China 's Protestants one of the largest such communities in the world . There is bound to be a consequence from the powerful position globally that China has come to occupy . A thoughtful biographer of Wang Mingdao , Thomas Alan Harvey , puts it this way : <p> Regardless of which policy the Chinese government pursues , the church in China will profoundly affect the shape of Christianity worldwide for generations to come . With some thirty to seventy million souls and a growth rate of 7 percent annually , the number of Christians in China dwarfs the number of Christians in most nations of the earth . Like Christians throughout the developing world , Chinese Christians represent the vanguard of the church in the twenty-first century . <p> Just as Christianity 's spread in the West led to the dominance in global Christendom of the Western , or Roman , interpretation for centuries , so the spread of China into Asia and the southern hemisphere in the past two decades will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well illuminated by Philip Jenkins in his book The Next Christendom . Already , the powerful weight of Third World evangelical theology within the global Anglican Communion has sought to counter modernist and liberal trends that some see as threatening to divide , if not ultimately destroy , the unity between the Anglican and Episcopal Churches in Britain , Canada , and the U.S. on the one hand , and the far larger group of member provinces of the Anglican Communion in the Third World . The sharp Third World Anglican criticism of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. , after it approved the election of an active homosexual as the Bishop of New Hampshire , is only the most recent example of this trend . <p> It is worth considering the possibility that not just the numerical , but the intellectual center of gravity for Christianity may move decisively out of Europe and North America as the Christianization of China continues and as China becomes a global superpower . <p> This article is adapted with permission from his new book , Jesus in Beijing : How Christianity Is Transforming China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall by Regnery Publishing . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By David Aikman <p> <p> David Aikman is former Beijing Bureau Chief of Time magazine . <p>
