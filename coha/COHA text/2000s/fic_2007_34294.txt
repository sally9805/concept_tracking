The afternoon lay strangled in a gloom of Chinese dust . Brown light , brown shadows twisted slowly over a naked riverbed . A kilometer or so beyond-distances were hard to judge against the dim , muddied horizon-a dirt path struggled up a hillside , pulling a reluctant village of broken , brown-roofed houses . A crumbling embankment crept by . A man 's head appeared . His blank eyes stared into the passing windows , then looked away , his face dusty , lungs and mouth and teeth and thoughts all gone to brown dust . Suddenly , laughter broke out in the coach ; a few passengers moved to get a better view . One woman , her voice too loud , shouted , " There ! " From nowhere , a flash of color became the shiny red boots of a small girl , her hair flying behind , arms pumping , breathlessly leaping , soaring across a single patch of newly turned , black-furrowed earth . The girl waved , both hands above her head ; the passengers clapped and knocked on the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced the shroud , and then , suddenly , it was gone . People returned to their reading , sleeping , drinking tea , anything to make the time pass . The train creaked around a bend ; the red boots disappeared from view . One or two watched for another sign ofspring , a forsythia bud or the faint feathered green of a distant willow . But there was nothing to see besides the wind , wandering through fields of rotting brown stubble . It was too soon . Even late March was too soon . And there was still too much damned dust in the air . Turning from the window , I realized a man in the aisle was standing quite still , staring at me . He smiled absently when he caught my eye and nodded as if we were acquainted . For a moment , I thought he might sit down and begin a conversation , but he walked past and into the next car without a word . It was hard to tell if he had a limp or if it was just the coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the image of the riverbed stared from the edge of consciousness . Rivulets of stone fed pebbled ponds ; great rivers of rock flowed to a bouldered ocean that never knew the moon . A man was walking along the gravel shore . As he passed he glanced at me , and his sallow face became a sallow sky ; the image was unnerving , and worse , it would not go away . I sat up again and looked around , but the man who had been staring at me was nowhere in sight . He had been wearing a brown cloth cap , a workman 's cap , though he did n't carry himself like a workman . There was something self-assured about him ; his smile never broke even when our eyes met . I had felt off guard for an instant , but he did n't waver ; it was as if he had been waiting for me to turn to around , to measure my reaction at being observed . The more I thought about it , the more I realized that the idle smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who wore a similar look when listening to the wind in the line of trees that marked the edge of our village . Often I had watched from a distance , wondering why he was smiling . Then one day I realized it was n't happiness but despair , a vacant smile attached to nothing , leading nowhere . My friend , let 's call him Chung , was a year older than I , a head taller , with long legs that gave him a gait I could match only by taking a small hop every few steps . He ran faster , jumped higher , than anyone else in the village . We were neighbors , his house close to my grandfather 's . Chung 's father had been killed in the war , somewhere in the mountains on the east coast in the brutal winter of 1950 . His mother never remarried . She was small and maybe a little crazy , a woman who kept to herself and rarely talked to other people except to worry aloud about her son 's health . She need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Chung and I joined the army together , we were both sent to a large cooperative farm about a hundred kilometers away to help tend the fields . Twice a month , when propaganda teams came by , we could sit on rough benches after dinner to watch a silent film playing shadows on the cracked wall of a whitewashed shed . The crickets sang but then grew still , listening to the click-click-click of the sprockets being torn , one after another , by the old projector . That was how Chung 's eyes flickered when he looked at you , a broken film playing on a hot summer night . I turned back to gaze out the window . No , I decided , the man in the aisle was a stranger ; we did n't know each other . His smile meant nothing . At last I dozed , until with a groan and hiss of brakes the coaches bumped each other in protest , then came to rest . Stepping down to the platform , I shouldered my bag and made my way to the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape the windy gloom that swept the city . I set off toward a small restaurant a few blocks away , near the Koryo Hotel , where they served plain food , simple and cheap , a bowl of soup and , if they had any , a piece of fish . I needed something to wash the dust out of my throat . I needed to sit where the diners ate quietly , a place where , unlike in Beijing , people did n't chatter loudly to no purpose . The street was deserted ; no neon signs assaulted the dark . Two cars passed slowly , their lights off . It felt good to be home .
