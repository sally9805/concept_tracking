Chapter One Tracy Gilbert closed her eyes and lifted her face to the soothing spray of the shower . As she allowed the water to flow through her hair for a final rinse , she calculated the time required to do her morning chores . First , the dry cleaner , then the grocery - the list was already in her purse . An hour should do it . Two at the most . If she told the baby-sitter she 'd be home by lunchtime , she might be able to squeeze in a quick trim at Cecilia 's shop . Turning off the tap , Tracy stepped out of the stall . She was just reaching for a towel , when she heard a door slam . Strange - the noise seemed too solid and loud to have come from an interior door . Besides , Hannah should still be asleep and she always left her bedroom door open . Tracy 's mind scrambled to discount the sound . Claus , her cat , might have jumped down from some high perch . A passing car might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrape of wood on wood , a span of quiet and then a jarring boom . Her alarm grew . Neither Claus nor a car could have made that noise . Horrid possibilities flashed through her mind - a home invasion or , worse , a child kidnapped right from bed . A child lost to his or her family for five or ten years . Perhaps never seen again . Had she locked the door last night ? She thought so , but maybe that was the night before last . Was Hannah in her bed ? Tracy took off down the hall , wrapping the towel around herself on the way . When she reached the door of her daughter 's bedroom and looked in , she breathed a sigh of relief . She stood there a moment , only vaguely aware of the puddle accumulating on the floor at her feet . Hannah was fine . Her tiny , four-year-old frame was sprawled sideways on the narrow bed . Her glossy black hair fell over one cheek ; her feet lay butted against the wall . Most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed . Slowly . Deeply . She was still asleep . Now Tracy wished she 'd donned her robe . She needed to investigate that sound right now . " Yoo-hoo , Tracy . You here ? " Tracy gripped the towel at her chest and whirled around . Even though she recognized the voice immediately , her surprise was enough to keep her heart racing . Her next door neighbor , Nellie Bell , strolled into the hall wearing a white chenille robe and curlers . " Lord , Nellie , you scared me to death , " Tracy whispered . " What are you doing in here ? " " Sorry , " Nellie said , " but I have news . I started to leave a message on your machine , but I knew you were home so I came on over . I rang the doorbell twice . " Tracy grabbed a bony arm to direct Nellie back down the hallway . " I gave you my spare key to use when we 're out of town , " she hissed , somewhat annoyed . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they reached the living room , Tracy let go of Nellie 's arm , wondering if her duplex neighbor even noticed that she was dripping wet and covered only by a towel . She considered ushering her right out the front door , but knew she 'd only be delaying the inevitable . Usually , the best tack with Nellie was to go along with the drama , then send her away with a polite , but firm , goodbye . Tracy shook her head . " Never mind , Nellie . Wait in here for a minute while I dress . And be quiet . Hannah 's asleep . " Tracy padded back toward her bedroom , closing the little girl 's door on the way past . While she dressed , she decided that she would ask the landlord to install a dead bolt . She 'd also ask Nellie to return the key . She hoped the news was short and significant . The lovely span of blue sky outside the window made Tracy want to finish her chores early so she could take her little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the central Asian orphanage two years ago , Tracy promised herself that her unmarried status would never be a burden to her child . Tracy was n't twenty-nine and single because she was too vacuous or homely to hold a man 's interest ; she was twenty-nine and single because life was too short for big mistakes . When she married , she 'd marry forever . Adopting a child could never be a mistake , so Tracy had made that commitment . She did her best to provide well for Hannah , and she also tried to be an involved parent . That was n't always easy . Tracy 's office-manager position at Vanderveer Organizing occupied her week-days , so she sent Hannah to an excellent day-care center that offered preschool activities . Lately , however , Tracy had been bringing work home in the evenings , too . Hence the need for a diligent handling of weekend chores . When Tracy returned to the living room , Nellie was sitting on the sofa munching on a doughnut . A white cardboard box containing the rest of the dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked as if Nellie was settling in . Tracy sighed . " Here , have a doughnut , " Nellie said , nudging the box . " I did n't think to bring drinks . Would you mind ? " Tracy held back a groan and started for the kitchen . " Orange juice ? " " That 'd be great . " As she poured the juice , Tracy reminded herself that Nellie was probably just lonely . Besides , this was Kirkwood , Kansas , where major change was generally met with stalwart resistance . Although the student population at Wheatland University caused the town to boom to city size every autumn , permanent residents clung to the ways of their pioneer ancestors . Neighbors talked across fences and borrowed cups of sugar . They lent a hand if a hand was needed . Nellie simply carried that old-fashioned friendliness a step too far . Make that a few steps . A mile . In fact , she was a total nuisance . Tracy returned to the living room and set Nellie 's glass of juice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nellie finished chewing her doughnut and blurted , " Riley Collins is back ! " Then she scanned Tracy 's face with pale , wild eyes . Tracy 's heart started to race again , but she crossed her arms and waited . " My friend Ruth saw him at the market early this morning , and he was buying a cartful - cereal , bread , cleaners . He bought out the supply of macaroni and cheese . Like he 's staying . " Tracy drew a deep breath , summoning every ounce of her patience . This was stunning news , absolutely . She still wanted her neighbor out of here . Maybe even more so now . " He was probably shopping for his grandma , " Tracy said as she bent down to close the lid to the doughnut box . Nellie frowned when Tracy placed the box in her lap , but she did n't stop talking . " Would an old woman use shaving cream and men 's razors ? " " Okay , so he 's visiting for the weekend . " Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door . Just as she expected , Nellie got up and followed her , carrying the box and talking all the way . " No one would eat a dozen boxes of macaroni and cheese in one weekend . My friend Ruth said he was at the old house all night . " When Nellie noticed that Tracy had opened the door and was handing her the glass of juice , she frowned again .
