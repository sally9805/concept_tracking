<p> California must move fast if it is to be a world leader in exploiting the next Gold Rush  --  nanotechnology , the science of incredibly small machinery and molecules with a wide range of industrial , medical and environmental applications  --  according to a report to be made public Monday . <p> Fashioned by the state 's Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology , the report represents California 's second attempt in recent years to position itself at the forefront of a potential superscience , although the approach would presumably be different than in 2004 , when voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 71 , the $3 billion stem cell research initiative . <p> The report , obtained by The Chronicle , says the governor , state and federal legislators , and state bureaucracies must jump into nanotechnology , an emerging field that visionaries say could transform much of human life and be a major engine of the future world economy , generating hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars annually . While the report also addresses ethical , safety and environmental concerns , it urges California to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nations . <p> The " blue ribbon " report , prepared with considerable input from those who could potentially benefit economically , was commissioned last December by state controller Steve Westly , a former eBay executive , and Rep. Mike Honda , D-San Jose . <p> " If we do n't get in early on nanotechnology , " Westly said in a statement Friday , " we will miss an incredible opportunity . We must aggressively go after research funding and business investment . If it 's going to be a California industry , we must act now and invest in education and our innovation infrastructure . <p> " Companies like GM and Levi 's have proven that nanotechnology is real . The experts are projecting a $1 trillion industry supporting 2 million jobs . The nanotechnology revolution is going to happen . The question is : will California lead it ? " <p> The term nanotechnology comes from " nanometer , " a billionth of a meter , the size of small clusters of atoms and molecules . More than a decade ago , scientists at centers such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused the world by releasing images of individual atoms that they arranged into the shapes of invisibly small stick men maps , and the acronym IBM using a special microscope that manipulates atoms one by one , as if they were billiard balls . <p> But nowadays such feats are routine . Nano-sized particles that have physical properties impossible to find in larger chemicals are being used in chemical solvents and other products , from golf clubs to clothes . Looking further into the future , scientists around the world are developing various ways to arrange molecule-sized clusters of tubes , wires , gears and other components into working machines that might some day be programmed for specific tasks at extremely small scales  --  for instance , for cleaning up toxic spills or for reassembling damaged parts of the human body , maybe even rewiring damaged spines . <p> Despite its promise , some environmentalists and scientists in recent years have warned about the possible adverse impacts on health and the environment of nanotech inventions . Being so small , they can pass through biological barriers that normally prevent the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thinking Big About Thinking Small : An Action Agenda for California " stresses that nanotechnology be developed safely . <p> " Environmental applications of nanotechnology are still in their infant stages , and there are also currently unknown , potential risks , " it says . " Public outreach and interaction is critical in order to avoid repeating the controversies associated with genetically modified organisms . This effort is particularly important in California , where environmental issues are taken more seriously than in many other regions . " <p> The report  --  led by Scott Hubbard , head of NASA 's Ames Research Center in Mountain View  --  is based on feedback from 48 advisers from a wide variety of state industries , and from academia , government agencies and venture capital groups . They include " a Who 's Who of Silicon Valley , " Westly aide Linda Chou told The Chronicle on Friday . <p> Among other things , Honda says he hopes a concerted state nano-campaign could help to bring back the good times in Silicon Valley , which has stagnated economically since the dot-com boom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic engine that our valley had enjoyed during the ' 90s , " Honda said . <p> In time , nanotechnology could have historic impact akin to the commercial exploitation of electricity or the development of microtechnology , as computer chips did in earlier epochs , Honda said . <p> Already , " you can get tennis balls put together ( from ) nanoscale particles , and you can get pants that have nanoparticles in them that make wine run off rather than staining the pants  --  they 're so waxy , it 's like a well-waxed car , " Honda said . " The National Science Foundation says that if we ( the nation ) move forward on nanoscale ( research ) ... by 2020 it could be a trillion-dollar industry . " <p> The report is scheduled to be released tomorrow at a press conference at NASA-Ames . <p> In effect , it calls for a nanotech version of the state 's stem cell initiative , another instance in which the Golden State jumped on a high-tech bandwagon that many claim will lead to a profitable and exciting tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for a state referendum on nanotechnology . Noting that the stem cell initiative became a " political football , " Honda says he prefers transforming California into an international nano-heavyweight by other means , such as tax initiatives and improved education in the sciences . <p> For years , talk of nanotechnology has stirred popular speculation ranging from the amazing to the scary  --  robotic subs patrolling one 's bloodstream for cholesterol and viruses to out-of-control nano-robots ravaging the landscape , as in Michael Crichton 's 2002 science-fiction novel " Prey . " <p> So far , real-life applications of nanotechnology have been much less dramatic , for example , the development of nanoparticles as chemical solvents for industry . But there 's a lot of gold in such seemingly mundane applications as the development of nano-machines and molecules with diameters measured in millionths or billionths of a meter , the report says . <p> Facing the " revolutionary breakthroughs " promised by nanotech , and the associated " new research , products , jobs and entire industries ... the state of California must now embrace the nanotechnology challenge ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California is to remain competitive . " <p> The report advocates some truly Hollywood-style ways of boosting nanotech 's prospects for California . While it urges the California Environmental Protection Agency to take steps to " encourage responsible environmental applications of nanotechnology , " the report also urges " educating the public " about the technology 's wondrous potential . <p> To help educate the public , the report says , California should :  --  " Brief the creative talent associated with the movie and TV industry on beneficial applications of nanotechnology. "  --  " Develop a compelling , inspirational Digital Cinema or IMAX educational film about nanotechnology. "  --  " Develop a nanotechnology video game ... and/or ... create additional museum exhibits on nanotechnology like those in the Lawrence Hall of Science 's ' NanoZone ' in Berkeley or the San Francisco Exploratorium 's ' Visualization Laboratory . ' " <p> Bullish on nanotech <p> The 36-page report proposes actions including :  --  Offer a " state income tax holiday " and sales-tax exemptions to nanotech investors and firms .  --  Provide matching funds to nano-research enterprises .  --  Seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier to license and market California-developed nano-related products .  --  Retrain mid-career professionals for the nanotech industry .  --  Mandate science-math instruction in K-12 schools at a minimum of one hour a day .  --  Monitor possible safety and environmental hazards of nanotechnologies . These carbon nanotubes have thermal properties that are ideal for keeping chips cool . / Photo courtesy NASA Ames
