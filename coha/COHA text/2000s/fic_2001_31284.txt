London May 1870 There was no light in the room other than that given off by the flames in the ornate marble fireplace . The fire was low , but managed to throw the couple on the divan into deep silhouette . Still , Caroline was able to make out their features . She knew who they were . She knew who they were very well indeed . She had , after all , recognized her fianc 's laugh through the closed door , which was why she 'd opened it in the first place . Unfortunately , it appeared she ought to have knocked first , since she 'd obviously interrupted a moment of utmost intimacy . And though she knew she should leave  --  or , at the very least , make her presence known  --  she found she could not move . She was riveted where she stood , staring quite against her will at the Lady Jacquelyn Seldon 's breasts , which had come out of the bodice of her gown , and were now bouncing vigorously up and down in rhythm to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thighs . It occurred to Caroline , as she stood there with one gloved hand gripping the doorknob , and the other clutching the frame , that her own breasts had never bounced with such wild abandon . Of course , her breasts were n't nearly so large as Lady Jacquelyn 's . Which might explain why it was the Lady Jacquelyn , and not Caroline , who was astride the Marquis of Winchilsea . Caroline had not previously been aware of her fianc 's predilection for large-breasted women , but apparently Lord Winchilsea had found her lacking in that particular category , and had therefore sought out someone better suited to his tastes . Which was certainly his right , of course . Only Caroline could n't help thinking he might have had the courtesy not to do it in one of Dame Ashforth 's sitting rooms , in the middle of a dinner party . I suppose I shall faint , Caroline thought , and gripped the doorknob tighter , in case the floor should suddenly rush up to meet her face , as often happened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which Caroline sometimes picked up and read . Only of course she did n't faint . Caroline had never fainted in her life , not even the time she fell off her horse and broke her arm in two places . She rather wished she would faint , because then she might at least have been spared the sight of the Lady Jacquelyn inserting her finger into Hurst 's mouth . Now why , Caroline wondered , did she do that ? Did men enjoy having women 's fingers shoved into their mouths ? Evidently they did , because the marquis began at once to suck noisily upon it . Why had n't anyone ever mentioned this to her ? If the marquis had wanted Caroline to put her finger into his mouth , she most certainly would have done so , if it would have made him happy . Really , it was completely unnecessary for him to turn to Lady Jacquelyn  --  with whom he was barely acquainted , let alone engaged  --  for something as simple as that . Beneath Lady Jacquelyn , the Marquis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Jacquelyn 's finger in the way . Caroline saw his hand move from Lady Jacquelyn 's hip to one of those sizable breasts . Hurst had not , Caroline saw , removed either his coat or his shirt . Well , she supposed he 'd be able to rejoin the dinner party more quickly that way . But surely with the fire  --  not to mention the heat Lady Jacquelyn 's body was surely generating  --  he must have been overly warm . He did n't seem to mind , however . The hand which had gone to cup Lady Jacquelyn 's breast moved to the back of her long neck , where fine tendrils of dark hair had escaped from the complicated coronet of curls atop her head . Then Hurst pulled her face down until her lips touched his . Lady Jacquelyn had to remove her finger from his mouth in order to better accommodate her tongue , which she placed there instead . Well , Caroline thought . That 's it , then . The wedding is most definitely off . She wondered if she ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and interrupt the lovers in their embrace ( if that was the correct term for it ) , make a scene . But then she decided that she simply would n't be able to endure what undoubtedly would follow : the excuses , the recriminations , Hurst ranting about his love for her , Jacquelyn 's tears . If Lady Jacquelyn could cry , which Caroline rather doubted . Really , what else could she do but turn around and leave the room as quietly as she 'd entered it ? Praying that Hurst and Jacquelyn were too preoccupied to hear the latch click , she eased the door gently closed behind her , and only then released a long-held breath . And wondered what she ought to do now . It was dark in the corridor just outside the sitting room door . Dark and cool , unlike the rest of Dame Ashforth 's town house , which was crowded with nearly a hundred guests and almost as many servants . No one was very likely to come this way , since all the champagne and food and music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiances , like herself . Her knees suddenly feeling a little weak , Caroline sank down onto the third and fourth steps of the narrow servants ' staircase just opposite the door she 'd closed so quietly . She was not , she knew , going to faint . But she did feel a little nauseous . She would need some time to compose herself before going back downstairs . Leaning one elbow upon her knee , Caroline rested her chin in her hand and regarded that door through the slender bars of the banister , wondering what she ought to do now . It seemed to her that the thing any normal girl would do was cry . After all , she had just caught her fianc in the arms  --  well , to be accurate , the legs  --  of another . She ought , she knew from her extensive novel reading , to be weeping and storming . And she wanted to weep and storm . She really did . She tried to summon up some tears , but none came . I suppose , Caroline thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrifically angry . Yes , that must be it . I am livid with rage , and that 's why I ca n't cry . Why , I should go find a pistol and come back and shoot Lady Jacquelyn in the heart with it . That 's what I ought to do . But the thought left her feeling more physically weak than ever , and she was quite glad she 'd sat down . She did n't like guns , and could not imagine ever shooting anyone with one  --  not even Lady Jacquelyn Seldon , who quite thoroughly deserved it . Besides , she told herself , even if I could shoot her  --  which I quite positively could n't  --  I would n't . What would be the point ? I 'd only be arrested . Caroline , finding a loose crystal bead on her skirt , pulled on it distractedly . And then I 'd have to go to jail . Caroline knew more than she 'd ever wanted to know about jail , because her best friend Emmy was a member of the London Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for chaining herself to the carriage wheels of various members of Parliament . Caroline did not want to go to jail , which Emmy had described for her in all its lurid detail , any more than she wanted to put a bullet through anyone . And supposing , she thought , they find me guilty . I 'll be hanged . And for what ? For shooting Lady Jacquelyn ? It would hardly be worth it . Caroline did n't have anything particularly against Lady Jacquelyn . Lady Jacquelyn had always been perfectly civil to Caroline . Really , Caroline decided , if she was going to shoot anybody  --  which she was n't , of course  --  it would have to be Hurst . Why , not even one hour ago he 'd been whispering into Caroline 's ear that he could n't wait for their wedding night , which was only one month away . Well , evidently he was so impatient for it that he 'd been forced to seek out someone else entirely with whom to rehearse it . Cheating bastard ! Caroline tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger brother Thomas and his friends call one another . Oh , yes . Whoremonger ! It would serve that whoremongering cheating bastard right if I shot him . And then she felt a rush of guilt for even thinking such a thing . Because of course she was perfectly conscious of how very much she owed Hurst . And not just because of what he 'd done for Tommy , either , but because out of all the girls in London , he 'd singled her out to marry , her to be the sole recipient of those slow , seductive kisses . Or at least , that 's what she 'd thought up until very recently . Now she realized that not only was she far from the sole recipient of those kisses , but that the ones she 'd been receiving were quite different from the ones Lady Jacquelyn was apparently used to . Damn ! She brought up her other elbow , and now rested her chin in both hands . What was she to do ? The correct thing , of course , would be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct in all of his activities  --  well , with the exception of this one , of course  --  and so Caroline thought it was not unreasonable to hope that he might be the one to break off their engagement , thus sparing her the embarrassment of having to do so . Darling , she pictured him saying . I am sorry , but you see , it turns out I 've met a girl I like a tremendously lot better than you .... But no . The Marquis of Winchilsea was nothing if not polite . He would probably say something like , Caroline , my sweet , do n't ask me to explain why , but I ca n't in good faith follow through with it . You understand , do n't you , old sport ? And Caroline would say she understood . Because Caroline was an old sport . Lady Jacquelyn Seldon was a strikingly attractive woman , who sang and played the harp quite beautifully , as talented as she was lovely . She would make any man a wonderful wife , although she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Seldons  --  Lady Jacquelyn 's father had been the fourteenth Duke of Childes  --  were an ancient and very well-respected family , but they had n't a penny to their name , only a few manor houses and an abbey or two scattered here and there . That Hurst , whose family was just as noble but likewise just as poor , would have chosen to align himself with the Seldons was n't surprising , though Caroline was n't certain it was the most prudent thing he had ever done . What did he and Lady Jacquelyn imagine they were going to live on , anyway ? Because unless they rented out all of those magnificent properties to some wealthy Americans , they had n't any source of income to speak of . But what did income matter , to two people in love ? It was n't any of Caroline 's concern , anyway , how the pair of them got on . Her problem was this : What was she going to tell her mother ? The Dowager Lady Bartlett was not going to take this well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the news was likely to send her into one of her infamous fits . She quite thoroughly adored Hurst . Why should n't she ? He had , after all , saved the life of her only son . The debt Caroline 's family owed the marquis was enormous . By agreeing to marry him , Caroline had hoped , in some small way , to repay his kindness . But now it was quite clear that winning Caroline 's hand had n't been any particular accomplishment for the young marquis . How humiliating ! And the invitations had already been sent out . Five hundred of them , to be exact . Five hundred people  --  the best of London society . Caroline supposed she was going to have to write to all of them . She began to feel a bit like crying when she thought of that . Five hundred letters . That was a bit much . Her hand usually cramped up after only two or three . Hurst ought to be the one to write the letters , she thought , bitterly . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Hurst , who was much more of an outdoorsman than an intellectual , had never written anything longer than a check , so Caroline knew counting on any help from him in that quarter was foolish to the extreme . Perhaps she could merely put an announcement in the paper . Yes , that was it . Something tasteful , explaining that the wedding of Lady Caroline Victoria Linford , only daughter of the first Earl of Bartlett , and only sister of the second , and Hurst Devenmore Slater , tenth Marquis of Winchilsea , was regretfully called off . Called off ? Was that the right term for it ? Lord , how embarrassing ! Thrown over for Lady Jacquelyn Seldon ! What would the girls back in school say ? Well , Caroline consoled herself . It could have been worse . She could n't think how , but she supposed it could . And then , quite suddenly , it was . Someone was coming . And not out of the sitting room , either , but down the corridor . It was someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the light from the candelabra he was holding illuminated his features enough for her to recognize them . And when she did , her heart stopped beating . She was quite sure of that . Her heart actually stopped beating for a moment . It had n't done that when she 'd opened the sitting room door and seen her fianc making love to another woman . No , not at all . But it did so now . In spite of the candelabra , his foot hit the leg of a small table , on which rested a vase of dried flowers . When Braden Granville 's foot hit the table , the vase wobbled , and then fell over , sending a number of dried petals floating down onto the carpet runner below . He cursed beneath his breath , and leaned down to right the vase . Caroline , watching him from between the banister bars , saw that he looked more annoyed than he should , for someone who 'd only accidentally knocked over some dried flowers . He knows , she thought . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodshed after all . Without conscious thought , she rose to her feet , and said , " H-hullo . " Only her voice came out sounding extraordinarily breathless . Braden Granville looked up sharply . " Who 's there ? " he asked . " It 's only me , " Caroline said . Whatever was the matter with her voice ? It sounded ridiculously high-pitched . She made an attempt to lower it . " Caroline Linford . I sat next to you last month at a dinner at Lady Chittenhouse 's . You probably do n't remember .... " " Oh . Lady Caroline . Of course . " There was no mistaking the disappointment in his deep voice . As she 'd been speaking , he 'd raised the candelabra and looked at her . She knew perfectly well what he 'd seen : a young woman of medium height and medium weight , whose hair was neither blonde nor brown , but a sort of sandy color , and whose eyes were neither blue nor green , but quite emphatically brown . Caroline knew she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacquelyn Seldon , but she also knew  --  because her brother Thomas had told her , and brothers were nothing if not brutally honest  --  that she was n't a girl to pass over without a second look , either . But Braden Granville certainly passed her over , quite without a second look . As if he were anything much to look at himself , Caroline thought , with some indignation . Conceited pig . After all , he was n't nearly so handsome as Hurst . Whereas the Marquis of Winchilsea was a golden Adonis , with his curly blond hair , blue eyes , fair complexion , and tall , arrow-straight frame , Braden Granville was dark as sin , broad across the shoulders to the point of being barrel-chested , and always looked as if he needed a shave , even , Caroline was quite certain , right after he 'd just had one . Braden Granville lowered the candelabra and said , " I do n't suppose you 've seen Lady Jacquelyn Seldon come this way , have you ? " Caroline 's gaze darted toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . She had n't meant to look anywhere near that door . But her gaze was drawn to it as surely as the moon drew the tide . " Lady Jacquelyn ? " she echoed , stalling for time . What would happen , Caroline wondered , if she told him she had seen Lady Jacquelyn ? That she was , in fact , just inside that door ? Why , Braden Granville would kill Hurst , that 's what . Thomas had told her all about the man he referred to admiringly as " Granville . " How " Granville , " who 'd been born in Seven Dials , the poorest , seediest district in London , had made a fortune in the firearms business . How " Granville " was as ruthless in his personal life as he was in his business affairs . How " Granville " was known for considering a bullet the swiftest way to handle problems in either area , a fact which was not hurt by his being a world-renowned crack shot with a pistol . Why , Hurst could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even by throwing the silly thing . " Yes , " Braden Granville said , eyeing her curiously . " Lady Jacquelyn Seldon . Surely you know her . " " Oh , " Caroline said . " Yes , I know her .... " " Well , " he said . The patience in his voice sounded quite forced . " Have you seen her go by here ? With a ... gentleman , perhaps ? I have reason to believe she was not alone . " Caroline swallowed . How odious this was ! Perhaps much more for him than for her . Because of course there was the fact that " Granville " had supposedly bedded more women than any man in London . This was not something Caroline 's brother had announced at the breakfast table , but something she 'd overheard him discussing with his friends . According to Thomas , " Granville " apparently had as many lovers as the infamous Don Juan . In fact , Thomas and his friends called him  --  with straight faces , no less  --  the Lothario of London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made an offer of marriage to the most beautiful and accomplished woman in all of England , Lady Jacquelyn Seldon . Who at that very moment was straddling Caroline 's fianc , the Marquis of Winchilsea . Just imagine how a proud , self-made man like Braden Granville  --  a man who was universally admired for his skills as a lover  --  would feel when he found out his own fiance had betrayed him . And with the Marquis of Winchilsea , of all people , who had n't a penny to his name , only his very pretty face to live upon ! Why , all Caroline had to do was say a word  --  just one word  --  and she would n't need to worry herself again with the wording of the Times announcement : Her wedding to the Marquis of Winchilsea would have to be called off due to his untimely death . She shook herself . Good Lord , what was she thinking ? She could n't allow Braden Granville to shoot Hurst . Not after the way Hurst had saved Tommy . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed toward the far end of the corridor . " She went that way . " Braden Granville 's face hardened . He had n't a very handsome face to begin with , in the traditional sense of the word , and it had not been treated kindly by life  --  he bore the deep scar of what looked like a knife wound in his right eyebrow . But when that face hardened with determination , it became almost frightening to look at  --  like looking at the face of the devil himself . What in heaven all the women he 'd bedded had seen in him , Caroline could n't imagine . She looked away , and concentrated instead on a vision in her mind 's eye of the face of the Marquis of Winchilsea , which was every bit as angelic as Braden Granville 's was ... not . " Was she with anyone ? " Caroline scissored a glance in his direction . " I beg your pardon ? " " I asked  --  " He took a deep breath , as if for patience . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " Why , yes , she was . " There , she told herself . That ought to get rid of him in a hurry . And thus keep him from discovering the truth , which lay just beyond that door , a few feet away . The smile Braden Granville 's lips curled into upon hearing this sent a convulsive shiver up Caroline 's spine . So pleased  --  so diabolically pleased  --  did he look , that for a moment , Caroline 's breath caught in her throat . Why , he really was a devil ! " Thank you , Lady Caroline , " Braden Granville said , sounding a good deal more cordial than he had before . And then he started down the hallway , and Caroline tried to breathe again . And found that she could n't . This was alarming , to say the least . But she was determined not to let Braden Granville know of her distress . No , what was important was not that she could no longer breathe , but that he go away , far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape .... Only her efforts to hide her discomfort did not appear to have been very effective , since just as he passed the staircase upon which Caroline stood , Braden Granville turned and looked back at her , inquisitively . " Are you quite all right , Lady Caroline ? " he asked . He knew , though she did n't know how . She 'd made no sound . How could she ? She could n't breathe . She nodded vigorously . " Perfectly well , " she managed to wheeze . " You 'd better hurry , or you might miss her . " But Braden Granville did not hurry . Oh , he looked very much as if he might have liked to . But instead he remained exactly where he was , looking at her with what , if she had n't already caught a glimpse of that wicked smile , she might have thought was concern . But no one with a smile as evil as that could be capable of feeling concern . " I think you 're lying , " Braden Granville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explode . He knows ! she thought , frantically . Oh , God , he knows ! And now he 's going to kill Hurst , and it will be all my fault ! But then he said , " You are n't perfectly well . You 've lost all the color from your face , and you seem to be having difficulty drawing breath . " " Nonsense , " Caroline gasped . Though she was lying , of course . She was gulping in enormous amounts of air , only none of it appeared to be actually getting into her lungs . " It is n't nonsense . " Braden Granville retraced his steps . When he 'd reached the stairs on which Caroline stood , he leaned over and laid a hand upon the back of her neck , just as , a few moments before , Caroline had seen the Marquis of Winchilsea lay his hand upon the back of Lady Jacquelyn 's neck . Caroline 's heart , which had skipped a beat when she 'd first seen Braden Granville come down the hall , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might burst . Good Lord , she thought , irrationally . He 's going to kiss me . He 's going to do to me whatever it is he 's done to all those women he 's supposedly bedded . And I shall be perfectly incapable of stopping him , because he 's the Lothario of London . Oddly , Caroline found the thought of being kissed by Braden Granville not in the least upsetting . Only instead of tilting her head up so that he could kiss her , the Lothario of London said , commandingly , " Sit down . " Caroline was so startled that she sat without question . She did n't suppose there were many people who would dare to disobey an order given by the great " Granville , " which was undoubtedly why he was so successful a businessman , not to mention lover . Then Braden Granville 's hand on her neck tightened , and , incredibly , he pushed her head down until it was between her knees . " There , " he said , with some satisfaction . " Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Caroline , staring at the beading on her skirt , said , her voice muffled against the stiff white satin , " Um . Thank you , Mr. Granville . " Her disappointment that he had n't tried to kiss her or molest her in any way , despite her dislike of him , was profound . And disturbing . " Think nothing of it , " Braden Granville said . Whoremonger ! Caroline thought to herself , as she stared into her own lap . I suppose I 'm not good enough to seduce . After all , who am I ? Oh , only the daughter of the first Earl of Bartlett . A nothing . A no one . I 'm certainly no great beauty , like Lady Jacquelyn Seldon . And I do n't have any manor houses in the Lake District . But there 's one thing I jolly well do have that Lady Jacquelyn does n't : the common decency not to sleep with another woman 's fianc . Oh , she added , mentally . And a bit of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , but he did not . The strong hand remained on the back of her neck . It was surprisingly warm . " Ridiculous things , corsets , " Braden Granville went on , conversationally . " Ought to be abolished . " Caroline , perfectly astonished that a man as great as Braden Granville should be standing in a hallway with his hand upon her neck  --  and even more surprised that he should have brought up a subject as indelicate as her corset  --  said , into her lap , " I suppose some people think so .... " Was this , she wondered , a prelude to taking her corset off her , and then  --  Good Lord  --  seducing her ? But Braden Granville only said , " I 'm surprised you wear one at all . Are n't you friends with Lady Emily Stanhope ? " This was such a surprising question that Caroline heard herself say , " You know Emmy ? " " Everyone knows Lady Emily . She 's become quite infamous for her involvement in the women 's suffrage movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , as well . " " Oh , " Caroline said , into her skirt . " I am . I mean , I do n't go to the rallies , or anything . I do n't much like rallies . It 's so much nicer to stay at home with a book than to go about shouting until you 're hoarse and chaining yourself to things . " " I see that you are , at heart , a true freedom fighter , Lady Caroline , " Braden Granville observed drily . " Oh , " Caroline said , realizing how foolish she must have sounded to him . " Oh , but I do support Emmy 's cause , you know . Last month alone I paid her court penalties twice because her father wo n't do it anymore . And I only wear a corset because , well , I think I do look nicer in one than not . " " I see . " He sounded amused . " Your suffragist leanings end where your comfort and vanity begin . At least you are honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . She knew that now . So he certainly was n't going to try to seduce her . Caroline did n't know much about men , but she strongly suspected they would n't bother seducing a girl they 'd made sport of . She was relieved , she supposed . But it was a little insulting that he had n't even tried . After all , he 'd apparently seduced every other girl in London . Why not her ? Caroline knew she was n't an elegant beauty , but she 'd certainly had her share of admirers , including , just that morning , a young man  --  a complete stranger  --  who 'd chased her for nearly an entire city block after she 'd roundly berated him for needlessly whipping his horse , only to tip his hat and say her smile was every bit as bright and pretty as a brand-new penny , and that he 'd never whip another horse again . But Braden Granville apparently had n't noticed her smile . And then the memory of the reason why she 'd lost her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time they 'd been in the hallway discussing her corset , Hurst had been in mortal danger of discovery ! Whatever could she have been thinking ? " Had n't you better go , Mr. Granville ? " Caroline asked , trying to disguise the urgency in her voice . " If you mean to find Lady Jacquelyn , I mean . " " Yes , " he said . There was no kindness in his voice now . " Well , I 'm sure there 's no chance of that any more . " Caroline , alarmed , asked , " No chance of what ? Finding her ? Oh , you 're quite wrong . I 'm sure she 's still close . " Then , realizing what she 'd said , she thrust a finger toward the opposite end of the hallway . " I 'm sure if you just follow her  --  " " No point , " Braden Granville said , flatly . Then he added , almost as if to himself , " I lost any chance I might have had at catching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn ten minutes back , and ended up in the kitchens . " " Little game ? " Caroline echoed , faintly . Like someone recalling himself , Braden Granville said , " Never mind . Feeling any better yet ? " Caroline inhaled . Her temples tightened with the beginning of a headache , but surprisingly , she found that she could breathe normally again . " Much better , " she said . " Thank you . " And then , because she was worried he might know more about the details of his fiance 's faithlessness than he was letting on  --  like , for instance , the identity of her secret lover  --  she added , " I 'm sure you 're wrong , Mr. Granville . About your bride-to-be . I 'm certain she is n't involved in any ... little game . With anyone . " The laugh Braden Granville let out was every bit as wicked as his smile had been when she 'd told him  --  oh , why , why had she told him ?  --  that she 'd seen his fiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lady Caroline , " he said , in a tone that was n't the least bit complimentary . " But please allow me to assure you that your confidence in Lady Jacquelyn is sorely misplaced . And when I get the name of the fellow , I 'll be only too happy to prove it , in a court of law , if necessary . You might mention that to her , when next you see her . " Quite openmouthed at this extraordinary declaration  --  and at the thought that she and Jacquelyn Seldon were anything but the most distant acquaintances  --  Caroline fought to think of some sort of reply . She was saved , however , from making any when the door to Dame Ashforth 's private sitting room opened and the Marquis of Winchilsea stepped into the corridor . " Oh , " Caroline said , finding her voice at last . " Dear . "
