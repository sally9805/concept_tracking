SURE , THE WHEEL WAS IMPORTANT , BUT IT WAS THE BEARING THAT REALLY GOT THINGS ROLLING . <p> the wheel is often described as the most significant invention of all time . Actually , that is not literally the ease . The real innovation was putting the axle and the bearing into the large round earner . <p> There is ancient evidence of the use of round surfaces to reduce the effort needed to move heavy objects . The Egyptians , for example , used logs . Bearings used with early wheels and axles were of plain form ( journal bearings ) , in which a journal or shaft is fifted with a close clearance m a sleeve . <p> The Romans made rudimentary use of anti-friction type ball bearings around the time of Christ . The remains of a Roman ship in Lake Nemi are of great interest in this regard , as three basic forms of rolling-element bearings with ball , cylindrical , and tapered rollers were found , although their use is unclear . <p> During the Renaissance , Leonardo da Vinci sketched an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the Industrial Revolution evolved , during the 18th century we went from sailing ships to steam power and bearings began to appear m great numbers . However , they , too , were journal rather than anti-friction type bearings . <p> One of the thorniest problems hindering man 's mobility up through the 18th century was known as the longitude problem . Lacking the ability to measure longitude , sailors literally became lost at sea once they lost sight of land . John Harrison solved this problem with a seaworthy clock called the chronometer . One of his early prototypes used a caged ball bearing , but in his quest to miniaturise the chronometer , he replaced this early use of an anti-friction bearing with a tiny jeweled journal bearing . <p> The beginning of the anti-friction bearing industry ( that is , of bearings with rolling elements ) as we know it started in the early 1880s when Friedrich Fischer in Germany developed a way to manufacture precision spherical Kills economically in high volumes and gave birth to Fischer AG . The 19th century also brought us railroads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the bicycle . <p> As is often the case , a manufacturing breakthrough is often the key to a successful product launch . First used in bicycles , ball bearings were a well-developed technology when the auto industry was launched at the turn of the 20th century . <p> The auto industry expanded rapidly . Motor vehicle registration in the United States increased from about 1,000 in 1898 to 10,000 in 1900 . By 1906 , more than 100,000 cars were registered . The million mark was exceeded by 1913 , after Henry Ford revolutionised the auto industry by introducing the assembly line and interchangeable parts , thus making the car affordable for the common man . By 1922 , 10 million cars were registered in the United States . <p> Today it is estimated that the world has an automobile population of approximately 800 million . The auto industry generates the need for better roads and machine tools . It 's an endless cycle for the growth and creation of jobs . <p> But Ford also saw the opportunity to apply auto technology to farming with the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th century , a U.S. farmer led 2.5 people . Today , that farmer feeds more than 100 Americans plus 32 people in other countries . This revolution has released the rest of the population to pursue the intellectual , cultural , and social development that has resulted in our modern society . Agricultural mechanization , like manufacturing , can be viewed as an enabling technology that made possible the other advances of the 20th century . <p> The first half of the century also brought us vacuum tubes and radios , airplanes , nylons , and antibiotics . The second half saw a revolution in electronic devices that significantly enhanced our ability in communications and improved productivity in our service and manufacturing industries . During the century , air travel became affordable for the masses and we put a marl on the moon in basically one decade of hard work in the 1960s . <p> Space age technology led to communication satellites , mobile phones , the Internet , and a revolution in the computer industry . In 1985 , an IBM mainframe cost $3 million . Today a $1,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Complex composite materials were developed and we finished the century with the launch of genetic research . This is creating the platform for great strides in medical science and the hope to extend people 's life spans by a significant degree . <p> The pace of change has also been phenomenal . It took us 5,000 years to go from the invention of the simple wheel to railroads , but within a single life span , 66 years , we went from man 's first flight to man 's first walk on the moon . <p> Enhanced mobility and communications have changed for the better the world in which we live . Solutions for reducing friction are at the root of societal progress . <p> Not only have improved anti-friction bearings played a significant role in the enhanced mobility of society in the last century , but the bearing industry has likewise benefited from the new technology as well . <p> The performance of hearings is greatly influenced by the quality and performance specifications of the steel used to make the bearings and the precision of the bearing 's internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently controlled to approximately 1/100 of the diameter of a human hair ( internal bearing tolerance can be controlled to 1 micrometer or better ) . <p> In the 1960s , it was realized that space flight would not be possible without enhanced fundamental knowledge of antifriction devices in the space environment of . a vacuum . During this time frame , A. N. Grubin of the Central Scientific Research Institute for Technology and Mechanical Engineering in Moscow and two Britons , D. Dowson of the University of Leeds and G.R. Higginson at the Royal Military College of Science in Shrivenham , developed an elasto-hydro-dynamic lubrication theory that explained the mechanism of why bearings and gears worked . <p> As the name of the theory implies , once the elastic deformation of the contacting components was taken into consideration , they were able to account for the thicker film that developed between the rolling elements and the races . Furthermore , the tremendous pressure that results in the contact area caused the lubricant to change to a pseudo-solid equal to the consistency of road asphalt , thus avoiding metal-to-metal contact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electronic held gave the bearing industry the took to verify these theories , to understand the fundamentals of machine tool dynamic 's to improve grinding precision , and to develop ultrasonic equipment to improve the quality and the performance specifications of steel . <p> Then , in the early 1970s , Intel invented the microprocessor and consistent precision control of machine tools , and the steel-making process became an economic reality . The end result is that , during the last 20 years , bearings less than 100 mm in bore size have increased in life by a factor of 10 times and bearings greater than 200 mm in bore size by a factor of 20 times . In turn , increased mechanical precision made possible the manufacture of ever-smaller and more refined electronic devices . <p> However , bearings are only part of a mechanical system . In transmissions and transaxles , gear design and selection are critical considerations . Actually , gears are greater design challenges than are bearings , as they not only are subject to contact fatigue , but bending fatigue and wear as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one must consider the total system . Bearings , gears , lubricants , seals , and housings are critical to the success of a design . <p> By combining the latest computer design tools with the improved bearing and gear performance developed during the last 20 years , transmissions have been upgraded to transmit three times the horsepower in the same space . <p> Henry Timken , inventor of the modern tapered roller bearing , is quoted as saying , " The man who could devise something that would reduce friction fundamentally would achieve something of real value to the world . " <p> Man 's ability to overcome friction has created a better life for an ever-increasing population . Awareness of the contrasts between the communist and capitalist economic systems created by enhanced mobility and improved communication certainly had a lot to do with the collapse of the Soviet Union without a major war . We 've seen a new socioeconomic globalization model develop , resulting in the rise of market capitalism around the world . Communications and mobility have lowered commercial and cultural barriers between nations . Urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1978 . <p> People who see their lives get better with each passing year do n't want war . Recent events in Iraq , North Korea , and the " war on terror " have and will hopefully come to positive conclusions from instant global communications and man 's improved mobility . It is difficult to have hidden tyranny in a world that has cell phones and the Internet . It is a world in which we can develop a better understanding of each other 's cultures , and political , religious , and socioeconomic systems , and so avoid conflict among ourselves . <p> That would be man 's true conquest of friction : through improved mobility and communications to create a prosperous world that , for the first time in history , could be at peace with itself . <p> Drawings from Henry Timken 's 1898 patent . <p> Early technology for producing bearings : The factory 's grinders were driven by belt and pulley arrangements connected to a single power source . <p> In the days of iron men and steel bearings , workers reduce steel ingots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this process is automated and safer . <p> As a publicity stunt in Chicago in 1930 , three women in high-heeled shoes hauled a 323-ton locomotive made for Timken and rolling on company bearings . <p> By Robert Leibensperger <p> <p> Robert Leibensperger is a retired executive vice president and chief operating officer and president for hearings of the Timken Co. in Canton , Ohio . <p>
