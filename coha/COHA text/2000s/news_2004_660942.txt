<p> Yes , it 's official : there was once water on Mars , a whole lot of it . <p> It 's worth mentioning that the Mars scientists have been very conservative about making this claim . For the last few weeks , we Caltech astronomers have been wandering over to the geology building to look at the new images of Martian rocks and soil , and for weeks we 've been wondering why the geologists have n't claimed success . <p> The pictures we 've been shown looked a whole lot like sedimentary rocks , with concretions ( more about that later ) , and cavities carved out by minerals dissolving away as water flowed through . The data seemed overwhelming to support the presence of water , or maybe it 's just that astronomers are used to working with such sparse data , we were the ones that were overwhelmed . At any rate , it 's now official . Mars was once wet , and the water sat around for a long time . Whether the water extended to planet-wide oceans , or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also unclear exactly when the water disappeared and where it went . But water there was . <p> So what , exactly , is this evidence ? What threw the balance so far in favor of water that NASA decided to make this extraordinary claim ? <p> As you might expect , it was more than one single piece of evidence , but a whole story that started to take shape . The most dramatic evidence of water has been found by Opportunity , the second of the rovers to land on Mars . The first rover , Spirit , could hardly be called a disappointment , but the landing site , Gustav Crater , was , at first , a bit disappointing . <p> From orbit , Gustav Crater looks like it must have been a lake at some point . There 's a large , sinuous channel that parts the crater wall to the South , and it looks exactly like a river that might have either fed or drained a long-past lake bounded by the crater walls . There are also drainage patterns to the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small system of channels . If water passed into the crater and sat around for a while , it may have dropped sentiment and laid down a lake bottom , and that 's what scientists were hoping Spirit would find . <p> This may indeed be what happened , but it now appears that something else altered the crater in the more recent past : volcanic activity . When Spirit started sampling the soil , it looked a lot like the Martian soil we had seen in the past : loose , red sand dotted with jagged pebbles , probably the residue of a lava field that was broken up by meteorite impacts . Spirit drilled into a few rocks and analyzed the chemistry , which turned out to be very much like basalt ( old lava ) rocks on Earth . <p> But on closer inspection , the lava rocks had tiny cracks and cavities , which seemed to have been filled in with a light-colored mineral . That sort of thing happens when water containing dissolved minerals interacts with lava , either as part of the original lava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solidified . <p> Was this the best evidence Mars could give us of past surface water ? <p> Then Opportunity knocked ( sorry , I just had to say it ) . The second rover 's landing site had been chosen in a novel way : instead of looking for evidence of water in the shape of landforms , scientists chose Opportunity 's site by its chemistry . <p> Meridiani Planum looks pretty boring from orbit ; it 's one of the flattest parts of the entire Martian surface . But in 1998 , the Mars Global Surveyor orbiting spacecraft made an intriguing discovery from above : using its infrared spectrometer instrument , the MGS spotted a substantial deposit of gray hematite in the plane . <p> Hematite is just oxidized iron , and it comes in two forms , red and gray . The red kind is what we on Earth usually think of as " rust " , and it 's also what gives the Martian soil its distinctive red coloration . That sort of hematite is present all over Mars ; nothing so special about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What separates the two forms of hematite is the size of the crystals . Gray hematite has larger , coarser crystals , which are harder to form than the tiny , fine crystals in the red form . The two kinds of hematite have exactly the same chemistry ( if you ground up the larger gray crystals into a fine powder , you 'd have red hematite ) , but the larger crystalline form is harder to make . On Earth , gray hematite usually forms around hot springs , or other places where iron has a chance to oxidize in water . Finding gray hematite does n't guarantee that water once flowed on Mars ( it is possible to form gray hematite from some kinds of volcanic activity ) , but it upped the odds quite a bit . <p> So down dropped Opportunity , ready to search for gray hematite and other chemical evidence of water . As I said before , Meridiani Planum is almost completely flat , so it was just a stroke of good fortune that sent the airbag-cushioned lander bouncing along the plane , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a few times , golf ball-like , before coming to rest . " Even Tiger Woods could n't have done better , " I heard one of the Mars geologists say . <p> As the airbags deflated and Opportunity took a first look around the crater , the Mars scientists could n't believe their eyes . Right in front of the lander was an exposed piece of Martian bedrock , the first such formation ever seen by human eyes . The intriguing rocks , christened the " Dumb Luck Formation " ( unofficially ) were unlike anything they had seen on Mars before . Instead of the random boulders and fine sand the scientists had become accustomed to , the bedrock was finely stratified , each layer thrown into relief by erosion from the Martian wind . It 's possible that such finely layered rock could have been laid down by volcanic ash , but the rocks looked an awful lot like sedimentary structures . <p> The scientists controlling Opportunity could hardly wait to get a closer look at the bedrock , and when Opportunity rolled up a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embedded in the rock , and scattered all around the surface of the soil , were tiny , regular spheres about the size of bb 's . <p> Once again , none of the previous landers or rovers had seen anything like these small spheres , called " blueberries " by the scientists . Closer inspection of the bedrock showed the blueberries to be buried in all layers of the rock , neatly tucked into the layered strata . As wind eroded the rock away , the blueberries would drop out and scatter on the ground . The blueberries were hematite-enriched , which started everyone thinking about similar structures on Earth , called " concretions " that form inside wet rocks . <p> Concretions are formed when mineral-rich water flows through rock strata . When the minerals begin to precipitate out ( usually around an irregularity in the rock that slows the flow of water ) , they can build up into small spheres . Was the presence of these spheres on Mars enough to guarantee that water had once flowed through this bedrock ? <p> Not quite . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcanic cloud , or the debris from a meteor impact . But if either of those had been the case , the blueberries should have been deposited in clear layers , not all throughout the rock strata . Opportunity started drilling into the rock , and sure enough , no discrete layers of blueberries could be seen . In fact , the blueberries did n't seem to distort the layers of rock around them at all , and some of the blueberries even seemed to have lines going through them that matched the layers in the rock around them . They must have formed in the rock itself , and not been deposited later . <p> Then the evidence for water began to pour in . Other parts of the bedrock had penny-sized holes , where something had either dropped out of the rock or dissolved away . On Earth , such holes are usually caused by the growth of crystals , which subsequently dissolve away or drop out of the rock . After sniffing around the bedrock , Opportunity 's instruments detected a substantial amount of jarosite , a mineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped water . <p> And that was the smoking gun . There 's really no way to make jarosite without water . Finally the scientists had no choice but to come to the conclusion that they had hoped for all along : the surface of Mars was once wet . <p> At the moment , Opportunity is about to amble over to another part of the bedrock , looking for evidence not only that the rock was exposed to water , but that it actually formed in it . Some preliminary images seem to show odd ripples and angles in the layers , as if the sediment was pushed around in flowing water , or maybe ancient waves on a Martian Ocean . After that , the rover will pull itself up out of the crater , and start rolling over the surrounding plane . <p> Everyone at NASA can breathe a well-earned sigh of relief . The main goal of the rovers was to detect the past-presence of water , and this has been accomplished . Now the rovers can have some serious fun , rolling along the sandy surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next question to be answered is what actually happened to the Martian seas and rivers , and what caused an entire planet to dry up and die . Or maybe something managed to survive that planetary catastrophe and is still waiting to be found . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
