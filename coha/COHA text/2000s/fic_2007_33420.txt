Do you ever get scared of things ? I do . For one thing , I 'm scared I 'll never get five hundred tiara points by the end of my first year here at the Academy , and then I wo n't be allowed to join the Tiara Club -- and I really want to ! It sounds so wonderful ! And I 'm scared of things like spiders and big , fierce dogs . Actually , thinking about anything big and fierce makes my knees weak ! Our principal , Queen Gloriana , is scary too . She 's very tall and gracious , but she can be very fierce if you do something wrong . Fairy Godmother -- Fairy G. -- is much friendlier , but even she can get angry . And when she does , she swells up to twice her usual size . Honestly . I 'm not joking ! When I first heard we were going to meet a real dragon , I was so frightened I got hiccups . We were having breakfast , and Queen Gloriana and Fairy G. came in to say good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Queen Gloriana said . " I have a very important announcement for the first-year students . This morning , as you know , you have a Creative Cake Cooking for Perfect Palace Parties Class . This afternoon , however , you are to go straight to the Tower Room just as soon as you 've finished lunch . You are very fortunate -- King Percival has agreed to bring in one of his dragons ! " The room was so quiet , you could have heard a pin drop.My heart was beating so fast , I thought I might burst . Then I hiccuped . And I was so embarrassed ! " Now , " our principal went on , " I want you all to listen very carefully to what King Percival tells you . He will instruct you on How to Talk to Dragons , and he will give you your tiara points at the end of the lesson . I look forward to hearing that you all have at least ten points ! " And then she swept out of the dining hall , and Fairy G. -- who is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course we all started to talk at once , except for Princess Perfecta and Princess Floreen . Perfecta pretended to give a bored yawn , and Floreen immediately copied her . Just because Perfecta was at the Academy last year , she thinks she knows everything , even though she only got about a hundred tiara points in the whole year ! Princess Alice 's sister said Queen Gloriana was furious with Perfecta , and now she 's back in the first year with us . " A dragon ! " Princess Katie said . Her eyes were shining . " What fun ! " " Do you think it 'll be very big ? " I asked nervously . " Huge and ferocious ! " Princess Charlotte said . Princess Sophia shook her head . " Queen Gloriana would never allow that , " she said . " I bet it 'll be a very old dragon that ca n't even breathe fire anymore . " " Come on ! " Alice stood up . " Let 's go and get the boring old Cake Cooking Class over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hurry up and finish your toast , Daisy . " I looked at the toast lying untouched on my plate . I did n't feel very hungry -- especially when I saw the burnt edges . They made me think of fiery breath . " I 'm done , thank you , " I said . Princess Emily took my hand as we hurried out of the dining room . " Do n't worry , " she whispered . " It 'll be okay . At least , I hope so ! " Behind us , Princess Perfecta said loudly , " Some people are such scaredy-cats ! "
