" The United States themselves , " wrote Walt Whitman , " are essentially the greatest poem . " That epic is rewritten by each generation but also revised every 11 seconds when a new American enters the population . On the eve of what could be a transformational election , we recently recorded the arrival of the 300 millionth American . The proximity of those two events created the perfect moment to launch what TIME expects will be an annual feature called " America by the Numbers , " an illustrated look at who we are as a nation  --  and where we 're going . It is TIME ' s first cover story told principally through graphics , and was produced by our superb graphics director , Jackson Dykman . <P> The idea that " demography is destiny , " a phrase usually attributed to the 19th century French philosopher Auguste Comte , lies at the foundation of this week 's special report . The social , cultural and economic fabric of a nation derives in large part from its population dynamics . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a complex mix of social factors , and it does . But it often traces mainly to a single population statistic : the number of young men between 15 and 30 years of age , the population cohort that tends to be responsible for the most crime . <P> A salient point of the special report is that , unlike Europe and Japan , the U.S. is still growing at a healthy clip . The reason we are still growing is that our immigrants and naturalized citizens are the one part of the population with a birth rate that is more than replacing itself . Half of all the population growth in America is occurring among Hispanics . With immigration becoming such a pivotal issue , people need to remember that in a very real sense immigration is what keeps us growing and helps invigorate our society in myriad ways . <P> New citizens swear to " bear true faith and allegiance " to the Constitution , pledging loyalty to a document written by men who could hardly have imagined a pluralistic democracy of this many people practicing this many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Americans had enough in common to form a united nation at all  --  and they were far more homogeneous than we are , and there were only about 4 million of them . It took 100 years to get to 50 million . We reached 100 million in 1915 , when the largest segment of the foreign-born population came from Germany . We reached 200 million in 1967 , when the largest portion of foreign-born Americans came from Italy . Today that largest segment is from Mexico . We are now less of a melting pot  --  the great assimilation metaphor of the 1950s  --  and more of a patchwork quilt , where people retain more of their national heritage within the context of being an American . <P> And what have we become politically ? One of the graphics in this issue 's special report beautifully illustrates how we are less a Red and Blue nation than a United States of Purple . I 've long believed that political polarization in America is much exaggerated and that the great mass of Americans are pragmatic moderates who tune out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with political scientist Morris Fiorina 's thesis that as a nation we are closely divided , not deeply divided , and that graphic shows it .
