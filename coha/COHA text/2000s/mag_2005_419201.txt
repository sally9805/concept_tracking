// WHEN WE THINK of open clusters in Scorpius , M6 and M7 immediately spring to mind . But for southern binocular observers there are several other wonderful groupings lying near the Scorpion , including one of the prettiest , NGC 6124 . Also known as Caldwell 75 , this gem is a snap to find . Locate the midpoint between the bright naked-eye double stars Mu ( ) and Zeta ( ? ) Scorpii , then scan 5 westward to center the cluster . Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered NGC 6124 during his survey of the southern skies in 1751 - just a few years before Charles Messier began compiling his famous catalog . James Dunlop also independently noted it in 1828 . The cluster lies about 1,600 lightyears away - consistent with many of the stars in the giant Scorpius-Centaurus OB association , a large grouping of massive stars that have a common age and proper motion . At magnitude 5.8 , NGC 6124 is at the threshold of naked-eye visibility under pristine skies . With my 10 x 50 binoculars it 's a beautiful sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the center and a dozen or so 8thand 9th-magnitude stars that seem offset toward the cluster 's southern edge . Viewed with my 15 x 70 binoculars , 20 or more stars can be seen , but most interestingly , some of their subtle hues become visible . The brightest member , an 8.7-magnitude star southeast of center , is certainly yellowish . Some other stars mostly on the southern side display a similar pale yellow tint . However , toward center other stars show a pastel blue-white color . Perceiving these tints requires concentration , large-aperture binoculars , and a dark sky . Using the Star Chart // HOW Go outside within an hour or so of a time listed above . Hold the map out in front of you and turn it around so the label for the direction you 're facing ( such as west or northeast ) is right-side up . The curved edge represents the horizon , and the stars above it on the map now match the stars in front of you in the sky . The center of the map is the zenith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Turn the map around so the label " Facing NW " is right-side up . About a third of the way from there to the map 's center is the bright star Arcturus . Go out and look northwest about a third of the way from horizontal to straight up . There 's Arcturus ! ( Venus and Jupiter are positioned for mid-August . ) Note : The map is plotted for 35 south latitude ( for example , Sydney , Buenos Aires , Cape Town ) . If you 're far north of there , stars in the northern part of the sky will be higher and stars in the south lower . Far south of 35 the reverse is true .
