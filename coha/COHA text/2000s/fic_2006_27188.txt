Her first mistake was agreeing to attend this Christmas party . Her second was downing a glass of champagne and then , for courage , another . Her third error in judgment was remembering Michael . The only reason Linette Collins had agreed to come was that it was easier to give in to Nancy and Rob than argue . It was well past time for her to socialize again , they claimed . Long past time for her to grieve . Only no one had told her how she was supposed to grow another heart . No one had told her all the time she 'd been granted to mourn her husband was two short years . Her heart had been rubbed raw in the time it had taken leukemia to claim her young husband 's life . Since Michael 's death the days had blended together , one twenty-four-hour period dragging into the next until the weeks and months had blurred together in a thick fog of disenchantment . Linette had gotten on with her life , the way everyone said she should . She went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She managed to do all that was required of her and nothing more , simply because she had n't the energy . Or the inclination . Then , out of the blue , when she was least expecting it , she 'd found peace . A shaky sort of acceptance that teetered , then , gradually , with time , righteditself . This serenity happened as if by magic . She woke one morning and realized the pain she 'd constantly carried with her did n't seem quite as heavy . The doubts , the fears , the never-ending litany of questions , faded . Unsure of how it had happened , Linette had graciously accepted this small slice of peace , this unexpected reprieve , and clung to it tenaciously Each day the feeling had grown stronger , and for the first time in months she felt whole . Almost whole , she amended . But when she 'd stepped into this Christmas party she had n't been prepared for the festivities to hit her quite this way . The fun , the singing , the laughter , reminded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day since Michael 's death . " I 'm so pleased you came , " Nancy said as she squeezed past Linette . Her sister-in-law smelled of cinnamon and bayberry and looked incredibly lovely in her sleeveless winter green velvet gown . Linette 's own white wool dress did n't fit as well as it should . She 'd done what she could to disguise how loose it was with a narrow gold belt . " I 'm pleased I came , too , " Linette bed , but it was only a small whiteone and unfortunately necessary . She sipped champagne and forced herself to smile . " Did you sample the hors d'oeuvres ? " Nancy asked . " You must ! I spent hours and hours assembling those little devils . Try the teriyaki chicken bits first . They 're wonderful . " She pressed her fingertips to her lips and kissed them noisily . " I 'll give them a taste , " Linette promised . Without warning , Nancy 's arms shot out and hugged Linette long and hard . When she drew back , Linette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lower lip quivered as she struggled to hold in the emotion . " I miss him so much , " she said , choking out the words . " I still think about him . It does n't seem like it 's been two years . " I know . " Instead it felt as if several lifetimes had passed . Linette squeezed Nancy 's hand . It often happened like this , her comforting others . How ironic . " Oh , damn . I did n't mean for that to happen , - Nancy murmured , pressing her index fingers beneath each eye while she blinked furiously in an effort to keep the tears from spilling down her cheeks . " It 's only natural you should miss Michael , " Linette offered , briefly wrapping her arm around Nancy 's waist . " It just hit me all at once that he was gone . I 'm sorry , Linette , the last thing you need is for me to remind you of Michael , especially tonight . This is a party , we 're supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle and Linette 's glass . She sipped from her own glass , then laughed lightly . " He 'd want us to celebrate . " That was true . Michael had always been generous and loving . " Oh , my , " Nancy said a tad breathlessly , turning around abruptly . Her startled eyes flew to Linette 's . " Tell me , how do I look ? " she asked , nervously brushing her hands down her skirt . Linette blinked , surprised by Nancy 's lack of confidence . " Great . " " You 're sure ? , " I 'm positive . Why ? ' " Rob 's boss and his wife just arrived . " " You do n't have a thing to worry about , " Linette assured her . " My makeup 's okay ? " She dabbed at her cheeks . " A beauty queen would envy you that face . Nancy laughed . " Rob 's up for promotion , you know . " Linette did n't , but the news was n't a surprise . She 'd often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toothpaste-ad smile on her lips , Nancy left , and Linette glanced at her watch once more . Ten more minutes , she decided , and then she 'd make an excuse and leave . Silently she 'd slip back to life without Michael . The minute Cain arrived at the Christmas party , he 'd noticed her . Like him , she was alone . Uncomfortable . Eager to escape . She was a lovely thing . Petite and fragile . He found himself studying her almost against his will . It was n't that she was strikingly beautiful . ' Winsome " came to mind , although it was an old-fashioned word and not often used these days . But then , she seemed to be a quaint kind of woman . It was almost as if she 'd stepped out of another time and place . Perhaps it was the sense of being lost that he felt . A sense of being alone and slightly afraid , uncomfortably aware of being out of place . Not afraid , he decided . The more he studied her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , dark valley . He was n't sure how he knew this , but he 'd come to trust his intuition . She sipped from the champagne glass and briefly gnawed on the corner of her lip . Watching her made Cain wonder if she 'd made her way completely across that valley . Maybe he should find out . No . He decided to leave well enough alone . Continues ...
