Chapter One CHARLIE ST . CLOUD WAS N'T THE BEST OR BRIGHTEST BOY in Essex County , but he was surely the most promising . He was junior-class vice president , shortstop of the Marblehead Magicians , and co-captain of the debate club . With a mischievous dimple on one cheek , nose and forehead freckled from the sun , and caramel eyes hidden beneath a flop of sandy-blond hair , he was already handsome at fifteen . He was a friend to jocks and geeks and even had a girlfriend one year older at school . Yes , Charlie St. Cloud was a blessed boy , quick of mind and body , destined for good things , perhaps even a scholarship at Dartmouth , Princeton , or one of those Ivied places . His mother , Louise , cheered his every achievement . Indeed , Charlie was both cause and cure for her own life 's disappointments . Those troubles had begun the very moment he was conceived , an unwanted pregnancy that pushed the man she loved-a carpenter with good hands-right out the door . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere deep inside and requiring bloody surgery to be born . Soon a second son arrived from another vanished father , and the years blurred into one endless struggle . But for all her woes , Charlie erased her pain with those twinkling eyes and optimism . She had grown to depend on him as her angel , her messenger of hope , and he could do no wrong . He grew up fast , worked hard at his books , watched out for his mom , and loved his kid brother more than anyone in the world . His name was Sam , and his father-a bail bondsman-was gone , too , barely leaving a trace except for his son 's curly brown hair and some bluish bruises on Louise 's face . Charlie believed he was the only true protector of his little brother , and someday , together , he knew they would make something of themselves in the world . The boys were three years apart , opposites in coloring and throwing arms , but best friends , united in their love of catching fish , climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sox . Then one day , Charlie made a disastrous decision , a mistake the police could not explain and the juvenile court did its best to overlook . To be precise , Charlie ruined everything on Friday , September 20 , 1991 . Mom was working the late shift at Penni 's market on Washington Street . The boys had come home from school with mischief on their minds . They had no homework to do until Sunday night . They had already gone spying on the Flynn twins down the block . They had jumped a fence and snuck onto the property of the Czech refugee who claimed to have invented the bazooka . At sunset , they had played catch under the pine trees in their yard on Cloutman 's Lane , just as they had done every night since Charlie had given Sam his first Rawlings glove for his seventh birthday . But now it was dark , and they had run out of adventures . Sam might have settled for crashing and watching Chris Isaak 's " Wicked Game " video on MTV , but Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan . " How ' bout night fishing on Devereux Beach ? " he asked Sam , setting his brother up perfectly . " Boring , " Sam said . " We always do that . How ' bout a movie ? Terminator 2 's playing at the Warwick . Nick Burridge will sneak us in the back . " " I 've got a better idea . " " It 's R-rated . What 's better than that ? " Charlie pulled out two tickets from the pocket of his jeans jacket . Red Sox tickets . They were playing the Yankees . Boston was on a roll , and the evil Bronx Bombers had lost eleven of their last thirteen . " No way ! Where 'd those come from ? " Sam asked . " I have my ways . " " How we gon na get there ? Fly ? " " Do n't you worry about that . Mrs. Pung is on vacation . We can borrow her wagon . " " Borrow ? You do n't even have a license ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ? " " Do n't worry . She 'll never know . " " We ca n't leave Oscar . He 'll freak out and mess up the house . " " He can come too . " Sure enough , Charlie , Sam , and their beagle were soon driving to Boston in Mrs. Pung 's Country Squire . Without their neighbor Mrs. Pung , that is . The police report would make considerable mention of two unlicensed minors , a dog , and a white stolen vehicle with red interior . But Mrs. Pung dropped the auto-theft charges when she got back from Naples , Florida . They were good kids , she said . They only borrowed the car . They made a terrible mistake . They more than paid the price . The drive took thirty minutes , and Charlie was especially careful on Route 1A where the Swampscott and Lynn cops patrolled . The boys listened to the pregame show on WRKO , talked about the last time they 'd been to the ballpark , and counted their money , calculating they had enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is our year , " Sam said . " The Sox 'll win the Series . " " They just have to break the Curse of the Bambino , " Charlie said . It was the superstition of every red-blooded Boston fan : Trading Babe Ruth to the Yankees had put a hex on the Sox . " You do n't believe in that stuff , do you ? " " Think about it . The Sox have n't won the Series since 1918 . The Yanks have done it twenty-two times . You do the math . " " C'm on , the Babe did n't make Bill Buckner boot that ground ball in ' 86 . " Buckner was the reviled first baseman who let an easy dribbler through his legs in the World Series , costing the Sox game six and , many swore , the championship . " How do you know ? " " He just did n't . " " Well , I think he did . " " Did not . " " Did too . " A standoff . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw . " And with that , the argument was done but not over . A draw was their way of stopping a dispute that would have gone on all night . It would be dutifully recorded in Charlie &; Sam 's Book of Big &; Small Arguments . And after the proper procedural motions , it could be started up again at any point . Ignoring their age difference , Sam threw himself into these arguments with passion , and the two brothers often spent hours in the Abbot public library on Pleasant Street gathering ammunition for their battles . Now , with its red bricks and shimmering glass , Boston was waiting across the Charles River . They turned down Brookline Avenue and could see the hazy lights of the stadium . Biting at the chilly air , Oscar leaned out the window . With his red and white coat , he was the perfect mascot for the adventure . In the parking lot , the boys stuffed their beagle into a backpack and took off for the bleachers . As they reached their seats a thundering cheer rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys laughingly bowed left and right to acknowledge the crowd . A stadium guard would later testify he saw the two unaccompanied youths , wearing caps and carrying mitts , but did not stop or question them . Their seats were in right field , directly behind a guy who must have been seven feet tall , but it did n't matter . It could have poured , it could have snowed . Nothing could ruin the spectacle of the Green Monster in left field , the grass , the chalk lines , and the infield dirt . They were right near Pesky 's pole , just 302 feet from home plate , easy distance for catching a home run . One of their heroes , Wade Boggs , sat out the game with a sore right shoulder , but Jody Reed took his place and delivered , with a run-scoring double and homer off the left-field foul pole . The boys ate two hot dogs each with extra relish . Oscar got some Cracker Jacks from a woman in the next row . A big bearded guy next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie was careful not to drink too much . Still , the police report would mention traces of alcohol in their blood . There was enough to raise questions , but not enough for answers . Clemens shut out the Yankees , allowing only three hits and striking out seven . The crowd cheered , and Oscar howled . With the final out and a 2-0 victory in the books , the fans scattered but the boys stayed in their seats , replaying the highlights . The team was now miraculously within striking distance of Toronto . Instead of falling apart in September , always the cruelest month , the Sox were surging . " Someday , we 'll have season tickets , " Charlie said . " Right there behind home plate in the first row . " " The bleachers are good enough for me , " Sam said , eating the last of the peanuts . " I do n't care about the seats . As long as it 's you and me , that 's what makes baseball great . " " We 'll always play ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights began shutting down . The ground crew had just about spread the tarp over the infield . " We better go , " Charlie said . The boys headed for the parking lot , where the white station wagon was all alone . The drive home was much faster . Springsteen was born to run on the radio . There was hardly any traffic . The trip would take half an hour . They would be home by 10:30 . Mom would n't be back until midnight . Mrs. Pung in Florida would never know . Just past the Wonderland Greyhound Park , Sam pulled a cassette from his pocket and stuck it in the radio . It was U2 's The Joshua Tree . Charlie sang along to " With or Without You . " " Bono rocks , " Sam said . " The Boss . " " Bono . " " The Boss . " " Draw ? " " Draw . " They drove silently for a while , then Sam asked out of the blue , " How long will it be until I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie answered . " I 'm serious . When do I stop being a kid ? " " Officially , " Charlie said , " when you 're twelve , you 're a man and you can do what you want . " " Says who ? " " Says me . " " I 'm a man and I can do what I want , " Sam said , enjoying the sound of it . A great moon floated on the Saugus River , and he rolled down the window . " Look , " he said . " It 's bigger tonight . Must be closer to us . " " Nah , " Charlie said . " It 's always the same distance . That 's just an optical illusion . " " What 's that ? " " When your eye plays tricks on you . " " What kind of trick ? " " Wherever it is in the sky , " Charlie said , " it 's always 225,745 miles away . " He did the math . Numbers were easy for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 170 days to get there . " " Mom would n't be too crazy about that , " Sam said . " And Mrs. Pung would n't be happy about the mileage . " The boys laughed . Then Sam said , " It 's no optical delusion . It 's closer tonight . I swear . Look , you can see a halo just like an angel 's . " " No such thing , " Charlie said . " That 's a refraction of the ice crystals in the upper atmosphere . " " Gee , I thought it was a refraction of the ice crystals on your butt ! " Sam howled with laughter , and Oscar barked in a series of sharp , distinctive woofs . Charlie checked his mirrors , aimed the car straight ahead , and took one quick glance to the right . The moon was flickering between the iron railings of the drawbridge , keeping pace with them as they sped home . It sure seemed closer than ever tonight . He turned his head for a better look . He thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of all his reckless decisions that night , surely this was the worst . Charlie raced the moon , and in the final second before the end , he saw the perfect image of happiness . Sam 's innocent face looking up at him . The curl dangling over his forehead . The Rawlings glove on his hand . And then there was only fracturing glass , metal , and blackness . Chapter Two WITH A COLD WIND RUSHING THROUGH THE SPANS IN THE General Edwards bridge , Florio Ferrente snatched the jaws of life from the back of his rig . The serrated blades weighed forty-one pounds and could chop through steel , but he wielded them like kitchen scissors in his hulking hands . Florio kneeled for a moment and offered the fireman 's prayer that came to his lips every time he went to work . Give me courage . Give me strength . Please , Lord , through it all , be at my side . Then came the blur of action . One thousand-one million-calculations and considerations . All instantaneous . He evaluated the spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He assessed the fastest way into the wreck-through the windshield , hood , or doors ? And he did the math on how much time he had for this rescue . Time , precious time . Florio ran past the jagged skid marks and jackknifed tractor trailer . He did n't bother to stop for the truck driver leaning against the center divider . The man 's head was in his hands . He reeked of beer and blood . It was one of the rules of rescue : Heaven protects fools and drunks . The guy would be fine . The instant license-plate check on the white wagon had produced the first bit of information . The Ford belonged to Mrs. Norman Pung of Cloutman 's Lane , Marblehead . Age : 73 . Vision-impaired . Perhaps the first clue . The vehicle was crunched and tossed upside down , like a cockroach , its front end smashed into the railing of the bridge . He could tell from the trail of glass and metal that the car had rolled at least twice . Florio dropped to the pavement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . No sound of breathing or moaning . Blood trickled through cracks in the metal . With swift movements , he jammed a power spreader into the narrow space between the hood and door . A quick flick of his thumb and the hydraulics surged . The car frame groaned as the machine drove the metal apart , clearing a narrow crawl space . Florio pushed his head inside the wreck and saw two boys , upside down , unconscious , tangled in seat belts . Their twisted arms were wrapped around each other in a bloody embrace . No sign of Mrs. Pung . " Two traumatic arrests up front , " he shouted to his partner , Trish Harrington . " A dog in back . Scoop and run . Priority One . " He slid out of the wreckage and shoved the Hurst tool into the hinges of the door . Another jab of the thumb , and the blades took two powerful bites . Florio pulled the door right off and threw it across the pavement . " Gim me two C-spine collars , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawled back inside . " Can you hear me ? " he said to the smaller boy . " Talk to me . " No response . No movement . The kid 's face and neck were wet with blood , eyes and lips swollen . It was another rule of rescue : If the child is quiet , be scared . Florio wrapped a brace around the boy 's neck , strapped on a backboard , then cut the seat belt with his knife . He lowered the patient gently and pulled him out onto the pavement . He was slight , around eighty pounds , and , incredibly , was still wearing a Rawlings baseball glove on one hand . " Pupils are blown , " Florio said , checking with his flashlight . " He 's posturing . Blood from the ears . " Bad signs , all . Time to go after the other victim . He climbed back inside . The teenager was pinned beneath the steering column . Florio wedged another spreader into the foot space and hit the hydraulics . As the metal separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he smelled the awful brew of radiator fluid and blood .
