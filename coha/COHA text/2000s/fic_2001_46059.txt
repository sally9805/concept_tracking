DIRECTIONS FOR THE SMALL : <p> YOU 'LL HAVE TO BOTTLE feed it . Give it plenty of strokes and hugs until it 'll follow no one but you . Do n't let it get too obstreperous . That can happen when no other big ones of its own kind are around . Then hand it over and leave the rest to us . You may name it if you feel so inclined though a name is not necessary . We 'll give it a name of our own choosing if we need one . Do n't expect too much . They have small brains , about the size of two lima beans . As far as we know , their smiles might not be smiles . Their tears , not tears . Though they bleed , they do n't feel pain as we do . Afterward , let it go on with what it has to do . Go live a different story someplace far from here . Do n't come back . Remember it belongs to us . And so I 'm thinking Lester ? Jester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balladeer ? He should have a name the opposite of what he will become . It might stand him in good stead , and there might be a little bit of hope . Probably nobody will ever get to know the name except for the two of us . He 'll have to find his own kind of joy by himself . Best to have a joyful name . At least that . And best we laugh a lot ( if that is laughing ) . Tickle and tussle . Dance . They call him , " it . " The sex is not important to them . He was absolutely the cutest thing I ever saw . They start out small . just like us . Little chubby goat-boy . Little chubby donkey-boy . Loves me already . As who else is there but me ? I know I must n't take it personally . But now , later , little skinny boy and even more goat-like and still the cutest thing I ever saw . Now he calls me Mush , Mushka , Mash .... I do n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... I think he should have a musical instrument . Something that makes a deep bass sound . Tuba or some such ? Or the biggest viol there is ? Except he 's still too small . I think trumpet . That 'll sound out nicely from mountain to mountain , though it is a bit on the military side and reminds me of those others who are in charge of us . See us - both of us leaping , though I 'm not as good at it as he is . See us on cliff edges , naked or almost . Well , he is , the sun browning us . See them , pointing up at us and looking pleased , folding their hands around their important papers , all the paraphernalia of their status and their jobs hanging about them . They wear so much nobody knows what they look like . Are they us or are they some sort of alien ? He depends on me . In the beginning I even chewed his food for him . Better than trying to cut it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks holding hands . When he gets tired I carry him piggyback . I made him booties . They do n't supply footwear or clothes . They say he grows too fast for them to bother . They say he does n't need shoes . ( Actually , they do n't supply much of anything.1 We fish . We pick flowers . By now he knows the names of all the ones around here . They say he 's not smart enough for that , but he is . We brought home a gopher snake . We hope it stays and lives under our shack . We named it Squiggly . We planted an apple tree . Already he says , " See my tree . " We named it Appy . When he 's happy he wiggles all over . They said that was n't happiness . They said he ca n't feel much more than rage . I think that 's what I 'm here for , to make sure it 's rage . What he says most of all is " Let 's get going . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . They think I 'll hold him back and that will make him angry , but even when he 's about to roar at night I 'm awake before it happens . I hear his first whimper so I 'm by his side before it can turn nasty . I sing to him , long song stories . " That 's a Ballad , " I say . " That 's what I named you , Balladeer . " We live at the top of a strategic pass . He 's supposed to get to know the whole region so he can patrol it . We climb to the mountain tops on each side , and across to the dangerous drop-off . He 'll be able to leap off that one of these days , but now he 's still too little to leap streams . We take off our booties and wade . ( He goes through booties like you would n't believe . ) It 's a paradise up here . If , that is , one likes one 's paradise steep and rocky , with boulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes it rugged . If one likes to slip and slide , and suddenly , flop ! so , now and then , be on the ground looking straight up into the , usually , blue sky . He gets into everything . I brought out my suitcases and shoes and hats . They forgot he might have wanted toys , but - well - when did a young one ever need toys when there are pebbles and sticks and flat pieces of slate , pots and pans , packing boxes ? And I have paper and crayons . Pieces of cloth . I know he 's male ( or he seems so to me ) but I made him a rag doll . What energy ! I wonder what his real mother would have done with him ? Of course she 'd have been much stronger . Frankly , I think he knows a lot more than even I can guess . I do n't need to tell him not to show his smarts . I think he 's hiding them even from me . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's still awkward . What can you expect from somebody growing so fast ? He has so much spark and sparkle . Sometimes I call him Bright Eyes . Brains like beans ! I do n't believe it . But I worry . His future ca n't possibly be good . I think he will die a bad death well before his time . One never wants that for a creature one has raised from birth . I wonder if we should run away . Pretend we got lost in the hills . But he 's too little for that now . Could I take him back to where he came tromp - bere must be some sort of a mother somewhere . Unless he was made some odd scientific way . I 'm wondering more and more why I was picked for this job ? I volunteered , but so did lots of others . There must be something special about me , but special in a good way or a bad way ? Probably something inept . A stupid side . What is it I do n't see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time I find out , it 'll probably be too late . But I wonder if my looks had anything to do with it ? Is that why we look alike ? And what about my own teeth ? They stick out , like his do . I always look as if I 'm getting ready to bite somebody . Anyway , I do n't care why they picked me . Look at us , how we get along . He 'd sacrifice himself for me , and I 'd do the same for him . I would have the minute he was put in my arms , squeaking and so tiny and vulnerable . I had to promise to keep him a secret , and I had to sign that I was aware my own life was in danger , but , I wonder , from him or from them ? What does a weapon need to know ? I do n't suppose much . Certainly not the names of flowers . Probably how to obey simple commands . A few words of everyday life might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to care for creatures when they 're juveniles , do n't they ? ' - no matter what they are to become . They never told me what he 'd end up being . I see hardly any signs . Perhaps that 's where my stupidity lies . As far as I 'm concerned he 's exactly the baby I always wished I 'd been able to have . I think we even look alike . I see myself in the way he smiles . The words he knows are my words . But I suppose , when I 've given him over and he 's all grown up , I wo n't recognize him at all . So far he 's only a little bit scaly , his toenails only a little bit too horny . You hardly notice . I wonder when his teeth will be growing ? Now he 's just losing them . We put them under his pillow . ( He does have a pillow . He carries it with him all the time . He 'd take it outside if I let him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not money . What would we do with money way out here ? I see the eyeteeth peeking out . Maybe they 'll all be eyeteeth pretty soon . They said they question his ability ever to follow more directions than three in a row , but already he remembers more than I do . He counts to a hundred with no trouble . He loves to yell it out , but I tell him to whisper . I have a hard time holding him back . He has aloud , echoing voice and loves to use it . I suppose he wo n't need a trumpet , he already sounds like one . Sometimes I tell him his name should be , " Let 's Go . " And he tells me mine should be , " Wait a Minute . " But I think I 've been too much : Wait a Minute . I think we should run away now . At first I thought we should wait until he 's larger and stronger , but that might be a mistake . I think we should run away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Let 's Get Going , " I say . " Get your pillow . We 're going on a trip . You 'll like it . " He likes it already and we have n't even started . He 's running round and round the kitchen table , leaping up on it every now and then . He could n't do that last year . He 'll be leaping wider streams than I can . I hope he waits for me . I 'll give him the heavy backpack to hold him down . I do n't say , " Save your energy . " He has plenty for anything . He 's singing . Dumb things like , " Here we go loop-de-looping-loo . " I say , " Come kiss me before we get going . A big fat wet one . Give me a big fat hug . " I have a funny feeling . Worried . I 'm not exactly a knowledgeable person - about anything , even the wilderness we 're on the edge of right here . They probably picked me for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpeting as usual . Every now and then he shouts and jumps up and down out of sheer joy . He 's as if on springs , backpack and all . I do n't know how he does it . Pretty soon I 'm going to tell him we 're on a secret trip and he should keep quiet . We go up into the treeless places and over the cliffs . It 's his turn to be , helping me . He leaps me over streams . We have to hurry . We have to get down into the trees before they come to check on us . As soon as we get well into them , I stop to give him a lesson ( I need a rest anyway ) . I say that , if we get found out , he should leave me there to face them alone and go hide by himself . I say , " Those rolls of paper they hold on to all the time could be weapons . " I explain weapons . I explain how he 's tough , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . No matter how strong and scaly he gets , they 'll have found something to destroy him with . " Leap a lot , " I say . " Side to side . And their weapons might be silent . They might look like pieces of paper . They have all those jewels . Those might be weapons , too . " I see in his eyes that he understands . ( Are his eyes getting smaller or is he getting larger all around them ? ) How could they say his brain was the size of two beans ? He sparkles with intelligence . And love . As I 'm telling him all these things ( that I 'd not thought I 'd have to do till later ) he holds my hand with his sandpapery one . I raise it to my lips and then he does the same to mine , clunk against his teeth . " Balladeer , " I say , " but do n't sing now . " " Ho dee ho dee ho dee ho , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night curled around each other . We always sleep that way . He does n't keep me warm . He never has . I 've suspected for a long time that he 's cold-blooded . He 's so sluggish in the morning , but of course I was , too , at that age . I just could n't wake up . My mother always had to come in and shake me . Yelling and knocking at my door just did n't do it . All that growing takes energy . It happened just as I was afraid it would . We got caught . He was getting too big to hide even here in the trees . Of course they picked morning , and an especially cold one . It 'll take him a while to realize anything . It 'll prove to them all the more his brains are beans . We ran - started to . He pulled me along with him , but there was no direction to go in . They were all over . Then he let go of me and did as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them . I 'd no idea he could do that and he was n't even warmed up yet . He trumpeted . He was over the cliff , down and going . One of them stayed to keep me prisoner but the rest went after him . I saw he was all right at the bottom of the cliff , leaping and leaping . Trumpeting and skipping . For him it was still as much fun as the first part of the trip . As if this was what he was born for and maybe he was . Or at least it 's sort of what he was born for . Certainly for leaping about the forest knocking down trees , pulling up bushes and tossing them into the air . I 'm wondering if I was born for this , the other side of it , to stand here handcuffed while he cavorts away , down the cliffs ? I wish he 'd carried me off with him , but I told him to go . I waved him away . " You 're on your own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " until I could n't see him anymore . He knocked down three of those keepers as he leaped away . One got stepped on . None got killed which is more than I can say about what they want to do to him , what with all these weapons . Or what might be weapons . He does n't know the difference between them and the enemy  --  whoever that is . I wish I had thought to tell him about the downtrodden . I know whose side he 'd be on if he knew about us , but there 's no rage in him toward anybody and never has been . There 's only joy . " Dead ! " they said , but they 've never brought any pieces of him back . Not even a claw nor a greenish scale to prove it . You 'd think they would have . I knew , though , whether he was dead or not , they 'd say he was . They wo n't want anybody but themselves out there looking for him , but I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love rampage . Because he loves me . I 'll never know . I do n't want to . Yes , I do . I 'll go hallooing off myself . They wo n't bother stopping me . Maybe I wo n't find him , but , if he 's out there , he 'll find me . They tore him from my arms . ( Or , more like it , they tore me from his arms . He was bigger than me by then and stronger . My skin came off on his claws . Metaphorically speaking , that is . ) Of course all this might be what was supposed to happen from the start : That he should love me and that he should lose me and that they should say he 's dead . I only just figured it out right now , which shows how slow I am . But this is not the end . He 's out there . And he has a right to be . Trumpeting . Rearing up . I know exactly what he 's doing . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such . Watching snakes . Eating berries . Maybe finding a bee tree and getting honey . Sitting quietly until some animal or other comes to see what he is . And still sitting , letting the animal , whatever it be .. ( once we sat like that for a fox and three kits ) letting it be , come close and then letting it walk away , safe . If you come upon him do n't be frightened . Of course by now he 'll be much bigger , but just sit down calmly and sing something . He likes music . Smile .
