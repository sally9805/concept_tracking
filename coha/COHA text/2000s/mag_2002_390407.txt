// An age-by-age guide to helping your child through it " MOMMY AND DADDY ARE GETTING A DIVORCE . " To children , those fateful words can mean a range of things , depending on their age . A baby or toddler wo n't understand them at all but may pick up on your somber tone and be confused or frightened by it ; an older child may worry that she 'll wind up like a friend at school who sees her dad only rarely , or that she 'll have to move to a smaller house and share a bedroom with her little sister . While it 's just about impossible to put a positive spin on such a negative event , there 's a lot parents can do to ease the difficult transition from intact family to divided one . Target your initial broaching of the topic to your child 's age ( if you have kids of widely differing ages , you might consider talking to each of them separately ) . And then be prepared to have your child come back with more questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation more fully . Some guidelines for talking to kids of various ages when a marriage splits apart : BABIES While you may think that infants are too young to be affected by divorce , they 're surprisingly intuitive . Even a 6-week-old can sense that his routine has been altered-he no longer sees both parents daily , he 's suddenly eating at a different time or sleeping in a new room . Schedule changes can be particularly anxiety-provoking for babies . " They need structure and continuity to feel safe and to trust that all is right with the world , " says M. Gary Neuman , author of Helping Your Kids Cope With Divorce the Sandcastles Way . It 's least disruptive to keep an infant at home and have the noncustodial parent visit frequently for short periods-an hour a day , for example , or two hours three times a week . " For the first three months of my son 's life , I had his dad come to my house whenever he wanted to see the baby , " says a mom in Chagrin Falls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving birth . If the baby must move back and forth between households , try to maintain the same naptime , feeding schedule , and bedtime rituals in each place . While you need n't re-create the nursery down to the Pooh Bear nightlight , purchasing two sets of identical sheets or bumpers can make an infant feel more at ease . Always make sure any favorite blankie or stuffed animal travels from house to house . An infant can sense if you 're depressed or angry and may also interpret hostility , sadness , or withdrawal as a reflection of your feelings for him . This can erode his sense of security and confidence , so it 's crucial to deal with your own personal demons . " See a counselor , a rabbi , a minister ; join a divorce support group ; lean on your friends , " advises Neuman . Be extra demonstrative with your baby , both physically and emotionally-you ca n't hug him too many times a day . Then be prepared for some fallout : Babies whose parents are going through a divorce may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intact households . This is a natural reaction to stress and should subside within a couple of months , after they 've adjusted to the new routine . They may also experience more severe separation anxiety ( which typically crops up at 8 or 9 months ) . " When something is taken away from you , in this case a parent , it 's natural to want to hold on tight to what you have left , " says Arnold Stolberg , Ph.D. , professor of psychology at Virginia Commonwealth University , in Richmond . Until his anxiety eases , every time you leave your child with his other parent , be sure to reassure him that you 're coming back . While he may not understand the words , he 'll pick up on your soothing tone . The good news about splitting up while your child is a baby is that , all other things being equal , he may ultimately suffer fewer adverse effects from a divorce than an older child , since he wo n't remember his parents ever having been together . TODDLERS A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " marriage " and " divorce , " so you 'll need to keep things concrete when broaching the subject . A simple statement , such as " Mommy and Daddy make each other sad and are going to live in different places , but you make us very happy " will do . At this age , a child 's main concern is how the breakup will affect her routine , so explain the situation as specifically as possible . " Mommy will live here in this house , and Daddy will live at Grandpa 's house " is easier for a toddler to grasp than " Daddy is moving to Arizona . " And do n't forget to reassure your child that no matter where everyone lives , you and your former spouse will still be her mommy and daddy and will love her as much as always . " When my husband and I divorced , he moved to Oregon for a year . I wanted him to have a close relationship with our daughter , who was eighteen months at the time , so I made sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he loves her , " says one Chicago mom . Just because toddlers ca n't always verbalize their emotions does n't mean they are n't feeling them . They may become sad and withdrawn or act out their anxiety by hitting or biting . If you sense your child 's upset , try to give voice to her feelings : " You look sad . I wonder if it 's been tough for you not to see Daddy all the time " or " How do you feel about moving to a new house ? That can be difficult . " If aggression becomes a problem , explain that it 's okay to be upset that Mommy or Daddy has moved out but that it 's not okay to hit . Then try to redirect the anger by encouraging your child to say " I 'm mad " or to scribble an " angry " picture or pound a play hammer . As with infants , it 's wise to allow your child to have frequent visits with the noncustodial parent . Every day for an hour and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be more practical . Again , young kids may have a difficult time warming up to the noncustodial parent if they 're out of touch for more than a few days . If your toddler balks at going to your former spouse 's house , talk about the fun she 'll have there . PRESCHOOLERS Between the ages of 3 and S , kids are magical thinkers . Their feelings and actions are so powerful , they may fear that Mommy or Daddy left because of something they said or did . " One fouryear-old girl I counseled was certain that her parents would n't have divorced if she and her brothers had n't argued so much , " says Neuman . This kind of guilt not only prompts kids to feel bad about themselves , but it may also make them anxious about the future , he says . " If they can cause their family to break up , what other horrible things might they do ? " Reassure your child that the divorce was n't his fault , that it happened simply because Mommy and Daddy are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent will move away too , leaving them to fend for themselves . They may try to act like superkids-eating all their vegetables , putting their toys away , going to bed cheerfully-figuring that you 'll be more likely to stick around if they do n't make waves . When Susan Rapaport and her husband split up four years ago , her son , Joseph , who was 5 at the time , would get excessively upset whenever anyone reprimanded him . " So anytime I had to call him on something , I made sure to add , " I want you with me always , and I 'm never going to leave you , " ' says the Chevy Chase , Maryland , mother of three . Similarly , preschoolers may become overly fearful when you go to work or even run a quick errand , assuming that you 're gone for good . Before leaving , be as specific as possible about when you 're coming back : " I 'll be home in time to feed you dinner " is more reassuring than " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a divorce by regressing . Because their coping skills are n't well developed , they may use baby talk , demand a pacifier , or need to cuddle a beloved blankie in order to comfort themselves during stressful times . If this occurs , help your child put words to the situation , and be sure to shower him with extra love and attention . Let him know that his feelings matter and that he can depend on you to be there for him , says Neuman . Once things settle down and he adjusts to the divorce , his babyish behavior should disappear within two or three months . GRADE-SCHOOLERS Older kids are going to have many of the same concerns as younger ones . While you can use more sophisticated language with them , your general message about the breakup should be simple and straightforward : " Mom and Dad were n't happy together , but we love you all the same and always will . " Photograph // Like younger kids , school-age children may blame themselves for the split ( although they may not admit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's less threatening for them to think that they somehow caused the divorce than to think that they have no control over bad things that happen , " says Stolberg . So be sure to reiterate-as often as necessary-that Mom or Dad did n't leave because of anything they said or did . Because older children have mastered the concept of time , it 's easier to explain to them how the divorce will affect their routine . One approach : Buy a calendar and draw a blue star on the days they 'll be with Dad and a yellow one on the days they 'll stay with Mom . " If children know in advance where they will be sleeping , they feet more in control , " says Stolberg . Older kids hate to stand out from the crowd , so they may worry that the divorce makes them different . To help them feel less isolated , point out other people-from rock stars to neighbors-who are divorced or whose parents have split . Then ask if there are specific issues that are bothering them - and do your best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , some grade-schoolers act out at school-fighting with friends , disrupting the classroom . Or they internalize their distress and suddenly develop chronic headaches or stomachaches . Let your child 's teachers , babysitters , and coaches know what 's going on in her life , and keep in close contact with them to monitor how she 's coping . If you notice that your child is having a tough time , try to get her to open up . Ann Croll of Rye , New York , whose daughter was 6 when she and her husband separated , broaches touchy topics when she and her daughter are on short rides in the car . " She knows , say , that after the next turn we have only half a block to go before we get to school , and she can stop thinking about it . " No matter how old your children are , it 's crucial to avoid trashing your ex in front of them . A child sees herself as an extension of her parents . So if you criticize a child 's dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stolberg . Denigrating your former spouse also makes it impossible for your child to love him without feeling as if she 's betraying you . It 's emotionally vital for kids to have a good relationship with both of their parents-whether or not they live under the same roof . Sidebar CHILDREN OF DIVORCE Do they grow up happy ? Sidebar Divorce can deeply trouble kids , triggering a range of reactions from anger and depression to behavioral problems at school , But what 's the longrange prognosis ? Are they doomed to carry lifelong emotional baggage ? Sidebar Not necessarily , according to the recent book For Better or for Worse : Divorce Reconsidered , by E. Mavis Hetherington , Ph.D. , and John Kelly . Hetherington looked at more than 1,400 families , some for as long as 24 years ( roughly half of whom were divorced ) . Within six years , 75 to 80 percent of kids whose parents had split were as happy and well adjusted as those from intact families . " The other twenty percent developed some kind of psychological , emotional , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , " she says . DIVORCE 'S DOWNSIDE A less optimistic picture was presented by Judith Wallerstein , Ph.D. , in The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce . In interviews with 59 divorced families over 25 years , she found that almost all grew up with fears about being able to sustain a happy relationship . Eventually-often with therapy or the help of a supportive spouse-most were able to compensate . " But growing into adulthood was definitely much harder for them , " she says . Many experts consider Hetherington 's work to be more scientifically valid because she included a control group from the start ( Wallerstein added hers later ) , had a larger sample size , and conducted objective personality assessments . " Dr. Wallerstein 's study is very insightful and useful in learning what happens after difficult divorces , " says Andrew Cherlin , Ph.D. , professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University . " But the families she interviewed were more dysfunctional than the average divorcing family . " On the other hand , says Norval Glenn , Ph.D. , professor of sociology at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have uncovered pain and anguish that Hetherington 's standardized tests would n't have detected . THE BOTTOM LINE There 's no doubt that children from broken homes are twice as likely to grow up and have marriages that end in divorce . But most experts agree that divorce itself is n't necessarily a negative sentence for children . Parents who remain loving ( but firm ) and consistent throughout their divorce will dramatically increase their odds of raising happy , well-adjusted kids .
