<p> When the red-carpet duo at Badgley Mischka sends out an evening cape embellished with a beaded skull and crossbones , it seems as if a new , darker side of fashion has come into play . Grays , blacks and browns with touches of red dominated runways big and small as Olympus Fashion Week came to a close . With higher necklines , lower hemlines and layered looks , designers were collectively moody , though not gloomy . <p> The girly look of the past few seasons has played itself out . The new look from American designers in New York ( fashion weeks continue in Europe through March 6 ) , was quiet and artful , with darker hues , beautiful fabrics and sculptural details like unusual pleating and draping , and most notably , every kind of sleeve you can look up in a fashion book . Tweeds have been tossed aside for houndstooth , checks and plaids . It 's time to hide those legs , that cleavage , designers here were saying . Continuing along with the great cover-up theme of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats , capes , caps , gloves . Vests ? When was the last time you remember a vest moment ? <p> The American designers here mixed it up with no real clear statement , except dark hues and layering . Even the party girl designers are wrapping legs in tights and arms in long sleeves for evening . There was some bareness , but also plenty of illusion netting at the sleeve , back or bodice . The shoe of the moment : A round-toed heel . <p> Otherwise , there was a little bit of everything . You like slouchy ? You got it . You want skinny pants and skirts ? All there . <p> Aside from a few oversize capes , overly bubbly skirts and slim skirts that ended unflatteringly below the calf , there were lots of wearable , flattering clothes . When they were feminine , they were n't girlish ; when they were structured , there was softness in a sleeve or a hemline . These are clothes that real women can relate to . <p> " Consumers get scared and intimidated by cutting-edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Teri Agins , senior special writer at the Wall Street Journal , who covers the fashion industry . " Ordinary sportswear on the runway does n't pop , so they trick it up with big hats or unwalkable shoes . In the end , the consumer finds her own ingenious way to put it all together . One good thing about the cutting-edge collections , like the layered one Marc Jacobs did , is that it allows companies like H &M; and Zara to adapt that look . " <p> Jacobs and Karl Lagerfeld , in his highly anticipated end-of-the week show , his first in New York , went the furthest with that concept . The most powerful runway statements providing a burst of energy came late in the week from veterans Donna Karan , Calvin Klein , Lagerfeld and the young team at Proenza Schouler and Zac Posen . <p> Lagerfeld , inspired by Ibsen and Strindberg and gray , cold European skies , sent out dark , disappear-inside-them clothes . The German designer , who also does collections for Chanel and Fendi , worked with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new , lower-priced collection , Karl Lagerfeld , and the more expensive Lagerfeld Collection ( both now owned by Tommy Hilfiger ) on the runway . His side-button jackets , kimono-like coats , slouchy trenches and black leather drawstring jackets were both soft and edgy . Then , a lightness of being for evening , with floor-sweeping , loose , " pink copper " gauzy chiffon dresses , some with knotted or gathered bodices and one with a hood . <p> " The collection is about tailoring , sculpting , shape making and mixing proportions with different influences and moods , " he said in his handwritten program notes . Lagerfeld has a new residence in New York filled with books , which are an addiction , he said at a news conference before the show . He hates cell phones and despises the Internet , he added , saying , " I should be at my desk , sketching and drawing . " But he is an " iPod freak , " he said ; he owns 100 of them , and his show was downloaded to iTunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that found its sexiness in a curvy neckline and illusion netting on a bodice , sleeves or back ; she bared the shoulders with what she called " elliptical collar " jackets , or bared the back with a low cowl drape . Her black-and-white houndstooth and ribbed jacket with an off-the-shoulder collar was a knockout . Her skirts were just short of bubbles , with only a hint of roundness , " round with air , " as her program notes described them . It was just the right mix . And like so many others , Karan showed everything with black opaque tights . <p> Many others , like Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough at Proenza Schouler ( a show not open to most of the regional press , although two of the label 's best customers , Vanessa and Victoria Traina , live in San Francisco ) , tempted their fun-loving party girls with long-sleeved velvet cocktail dresses and long-sleeved filmy sweaters under evening dresses , with black opaque tights . Speaking of San Francisco : Tatiana and Serge Sorokko , Christine Suppes ( editor , fashionlines.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Rucci . <p> If Stephanie Solomon , director of women 's ready-to-wear at Bloomingdale 's , has her way , some of the best pieces from Proenza Schouler will be in the new San Francisco store for fall . " They have really evolved this season , " she told me after the show . " I absolutely loved the collection . I 'm so glad to see them get away from bustiers . I especially loved the leather flyaway jacket , and hope to be able to carry it in the San Francisco store for fall . " <p> Fashion week also marked a milestone for some of the lesser-knowns to stand up and get noticed , like Maria Cornejo , designer of a line called Zero , who gave a white cotton blouse an update with a soft neckline with a stitched-down pleated collar that gave it just enough femininity . ( Metier , the Sutter Street boutique , will most likely carry the fall line . ) " It 's more special what you do n't see than what you do see , " Cornejo said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which typified many similar approaches in the course of the week . " A skinny pair of leggings sticking out of a voluminous coat is sexy  --  there 's a strength and fragility in that . " <p> In Stephanie Schur 's second collection for Michon Schur , the designer has emerged a star . Her handmade fan ruffle details on blouses , a heathered cowl-neck coat with asymmetrical buttons , a bib-front sheath and other modern feminine looks were stunning . The day after her showroom presentation , the phone was ringing madly . " Everyone is fighting over the collection , actually , " said a showroom staffer . <p> Halfway through fashion week , the can't-wait crowd inside the tents was already wearing next fall 's trends ; Julie Gilhart , fashion director of Barneys , showed up at Cornejo 's show in leggings that stopped at the ankle , red high heels and a knee-length coat . Other front rowers appeared , lickety-split , in cowl-neck sweaters and opaque tights with skirts . <p> Unlike last season , when the photographers seemed to outnumber the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new system of runway passes and limited the number of photographers , " said Fern Mallis , the executive director of 7th on Sixth , which produces Olympus Fashion Week . " There was a problem last season ; we listened ; we paid attention . " <p> Last fall , Jennifer Lopez 's show , which closed out the week , was a push-and-shove affair . This season , her ' 50s-inspired show was held in a small , but still very crowded , downtown space , decorated with an Airstream trailer ; mini bottles of Coke , pigs-in-a-blanket and miniburgers were served . There was a below-the-knee houndstooth coat , slouchy sweaters , a blue artist 's smock with a ruff collar , bell sleeves on a checked coat and drapey jersey tunics over leggings . Even J.Lo. herself went a bit more conservative this time around , coming out in a slim blue knit dress that hit a couple of inches below the knee . " We 've really grown in fabrication , fit and cut , " she said as she introduced the show . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carrie Underwood , Ileana Douglas , Hilary Duff and Marcia Gay Harden were everywhere , it seemed ; even as the strobes went off for Uma Thurman in the front row at Zac Posen 's show , everyone was already seated and the show was n't delayed . <p> There were fewer B-list celebrities ( there was a Paris Hilton look-alike this year , but no Paris ) . But there was a new B-list : bloggers . <p> A growing number of them are now getting tickets to big shows , and in a few short days , some wrote , they learned how to sashay past the guys checking the seat assignments , sneak into a good spot and grab a goodie bag . <p> One blogger scored herself a borrowed wardrobe from BCBG and A.B.S. to wear while hanging out in the tents . " The PR people really outdid themselves in providing great clothing that really took me through the week , " posted Julie Fredrickson , at **31;6425;TOOLONG . <p> From the other side of the runway , designer Nanette Lepore blogged from backstage last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elation ( Debbie Harry requested a ticket ! ) , being camera-shy and her devotion to the round-toe plaid wedges she designed to complement her collection . <p> Many of the other leaders , like Ralph Lauren and Vera Wang , went longer and darker . Bryan Bradley at Tuleh , known for colorful , fun-loving , flirty looks , left that behind for three-piece tweed suits and long pencil skirts . <p> But the week in New York showed a clear , inevitable move away from all the super-girly sparkles , ruffles , tiered skirts and embellishments of the past few seasons . <p> While many women are not likely to run out and buy a tuxedo shorts suit next fall ( big trend ) , who is n't going to welcome the return of the black opaque tights shown with practically everything ? <p> Emulating the runway look without looking like a victim , in black tights and a beaded cocktail dress and black heels , with no worries about strappy sandals , less-than-perfect legs or a missed pedicure appointment .
