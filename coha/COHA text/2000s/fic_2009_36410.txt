Beware The Wolf <p> 7 September 2008 Pier 8 , New London Submarine Base <p> " Petty Officer Gibson , front and center , " barked Jerry as he and the communications officer , Lieutenant Chandler , stood in front of the operations department , assembled in Seawolf 's navigation equipment room . Seawolf was one of the biggest attack submarines in the U.S. Navy , but the ops department was just barely able to squeeze everyone in . <p> When Jerry called out his name , Gibson stepped up smartly and took the clipboard . IT2 Paul Gibson had been aboard the boat longer than Jerry . He was a little on the pudgy side , a common problem on subs where great food and few opportunities for exercise left their mark . He was twenty-seven , with a wife and a one- year- old son . He took position in front of the assembled sailors and began reading the plan of the day . <p> " Our underway is now in eight days . Supply chits have to be turned in by tomorrow if Mr. Constantino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what the PoD said , and Gibson had everything under control . As he stood , half- listening , Jerry looked over the operations department  --  his department . That still sounded strange , even after six months on board . Ops department was eighteen men , including Jerry and Lieutenant Chandler . <p> As the commo , Chandler was in charge of six " information systems technicians , " or " ITs , " although most of the crew still called them radiomen . <p> And he was responsible for all the boat 's communications equipment and encryption gear . <p> And as operations officer , Jerry was responsible for everyone in the department , including Chandler . Jerry was also Seawolf 's navigator , in direct charge of the four quartermasters and six electronics technicians who ran the boat 's navigation systems . <p> His sailors were neatly lined up in three groups , wearing clean working uniforms . Civilians would be impressed by their military bearing and discipline . But Jerry knew he faced a band of rugged individualists who worked together only by choice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically , or even easily . <p> " Family day is Saturday , with a cookout at the ball field . We 're still looking for some people to help with the kids ' games , so contact MM2 Stone if you 're interested . The ship 's ombudsman and the family support network still need email addresses . . . " <p> Jerry 's mind wandered to his own personal " to do " list . However , since he was navigator , operations officer , and senior watch officer , technically it was " lists . " Oh . And he was one of three qualified divers on board . <p> As he mentally went down his tally , he looked down at his watch to check the time . No sweat , he still had fifteen minutes before his meeting with Lieutenant Commander Shimko , the executive officer . He had to go over the voyage plan  --  again . The crew would n't be briefed about their destination until they were under way , but Jerry not only knew where they were going , he had planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Seawolf 's benefit that the XO was a detail freak , but it did n't make Jerry 's life any easier . He was pretty sure he 'd dreamed about the north Barents Sea again last night . He 'd been cold when he woke up . <p> Gibson finished reading the PoD and looked expectantly at Jerry . Sensing his cue , Mitchell stepped forward and asked , " Do the chiefs or leading petty officers have anything further to add ? " All four men responded in the negative . <p> " All right , then . Turn to and commence ship 's work . Dismissed . " As the members of the department queued up to exit through the narrow door into the control room , Jerry saw QM1 Peters waiting for his turn , and caught the quartermaster 's eye . He pointed to his watch and then held up five fingers . Peters nodded , understanding . The ship 's leading quartermaster would be at the briefing with the XO as well . <p> Jerry waited patiently to exit the nav equipment space and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the same deck , and near his quarters , he 'd have to hurry a little if he wanted to be punctual . To save time , he 'd already organized the materials he needed to bring the night before , but as he approached his stateroom he saw Lieutenant Chandler waiting with a sheaf of papers in his hand and an earnest expression on his face . " Jerry , here are the last of our school requests , but I need to ask you a few questions . . . " <p> Jerry cut him off as he stepped into his stateroom . " Sorry , Matt . I 'm wearing my navigator hat right now . I 've got a voyage planning review in the wardroom with the XO . " He dialed his safe and began removing his notes . <p> " I know , but this will only take a moment , and I have to turn them in this morning , " the comms officer pleaded . <p> " It 'll be morning for some time yet , and I do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have added a note of finality to Jerry 's statement . <p> Chandler would n't give up . " I 'll just turn them in as is . They 're probably fine . " <p> " Not without me seeing them first , " Jerry insisted . That was standard procedure for any paperwork going up the chain of command . And Chandler knew better . When the commo smiled and started to offer Jerry the documents , Jerry repeated , " After the meeting . Find me then , " he said firmly , letting some irritation show . Jerry did n't like mind games . Chandler seemed to think it was the only way to get things done . <p> Hurrying the few steps to the wardroom , Jerry entered and found QM1 Peters already inside , laying out the charts . Jerry checked them over one last time , carefully comparing them to his own notes . Only after everything appeared in order did he allow himself to get a cup of coffee . <p> ETC Hudson and Lieutenant Commander Shimko appeared in the door as Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who gratefully accepted one . Peters also had some , but Hudson declined . <p> Marcus Shimko was second-generation American , born to Andrei and Natalia six years after they 'd emigrated from what was then the Soviet Union and now Belarus . He was short , about Jerry 's height , but stocky where Jerry was slim . Shimko had already lost a lot of his hair , but what was left was sandy and cut very short . He was all business , an exceptional organizer and a detail hound  --  the perfect executive officer . <p> Jerry teased Hudson about " not stooping to drink wardroom coffee " but kept one eye on the XO . When the executive officer sat down , ship 's business took over . Jerry picked up his notes while Hudson double-checked the wardroom door , making sure it was locked . <p> With his laser pointer , Jerry highlighted individual sections of the entire mission on the nautical chart taped to the table . The bright blue and yellow chart was overlaid with black lines showing Seawolf 's plotted course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Our projected track takes us out of the Block Island Sound , east , and then northeast . I 've recommended passing to the west of Iceland , using the Denmark Strait . Once past Iceland , we follow the east coast of Greenland , using shallow water and biologics wherever possible to mask our approach . Assuming an on- time departure on the fifteenth and a speed of advance of sixteen knots , we should arrive at Point Alpha at 1200 Zulu time on the twenty- third . " Jerry pointed to the first of a series of x 's on the chart . <p> He 'd rehearsed the speech several times , and gotten it off smoothly . Shimko just nodded , inviting Jerry to continue . So far , so good . <p> " I 've marked the known Russian exercise areas and traffic lanes on the chart . They 've used these same areas for six years , and there 's no indication that they plan to change them . We have two areas to survey , and a total of eighteen sorties with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this part of the Barents , I 've chosen sites within each area with potentially good bottom topography and reasonable acoustic conditions , but also a safe route in and out during the survey . " <p> Shimko and Hudson studied the chart closely . Jerry and Peters , having laid out the courses and knowing them by heart , stayed out of the way to give the XO and chief some room . <p> " How long for each survey ? " Shimko asked . <p> " I 'm planning on forty-five hours . The UUVs have a fifty-hour operational endurance with a ten- hour emergency reserve . That gives us about a twenty-five-percent safety margin . " <p> " How many UUVs will we have out at any one time ? " <p> " Technically , XO , there are times during the mission , for about an hour , when all three UUVs will be out . One will be deployed surveying sites , while a second unit is launched and the third waits to be recovered . " <p> " During which Seawolf is tied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only constrained in our ability to maneuver when we 're launching or recovering a UUV , which takes no more than half an hour . Once that 's done we can maneuver freely , we just have to stay relatively close to the rendezvous point so the UUV can find us again ... " <p> " Never mind , " Shimko interrupted . " The critical issue is being committed to one spot while a UUV is deployed . What if we have to abort a rendezvous to evade a transiting vessel ? " <p> Jerry had an answer . " Sea ice will be starting to form in the area by the time we arrive , so there is little risk of running into fishing traffic or even other merchant ships . The only likely problem would be from Russian warships or submarines , and according to the intel weenies , their training cycle is largely over for the year . There may be some small-scale operations before the ports freeze up , but they just concluded a major exercise period . Our mission plan is to get in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start any last- minute training evolutions . " <p> Shimko was not deflected . " If we have to bug out , we need a plan to rendezvous with the UUV somewhere else . " He pointed to an exercise area , outlined in blue and neatly labeled " R-Two . " <p> " Overall , you 've got a good approach route into the area , and the route leading from one survey site to the next is along a good path . You also have an emergency recovery location for each site , but it 's too close to the site itself . I want two alternate rendezvous locations for each survey site , well away from the box . " <p> " Yessir , " Jerry responded . " For unmanned vehicles , they are pretty smart . If a survey is interrupted , we can give it a new location and tell it to loiter there until we arrive . " <p> " That 's fine , but I do n't want you hunting all over the chart for a spot when the air is filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in calmer times . " Jerry nodded his understanding . <p> Shimko pushed his point . " This is the Russian Navy 's playground , even if it is international waters . They 're normally touchy about visitors , but since they lost Gepard , they 've reached new heights of paranoia  --  even for Slavs . <p> " You know , they blame us for Gepard ' s loss . " Shimko gave Jerry a look that seemed much longer and more intense than a simple glance . Jerry 's last boat , Memphis , had been very involved with the Russian sub 's demise , but the entire event had been classified , sealed , and was withheld even from the rest of the submarine service . Jerry tried to look innocent . <p> " We ca n't assume they wo n't change their routine , " Shimko continued . <p> " Maybe they 'll patrol in the thickening sea ice for a longer period than we think . The hulls on their surface ships are ice- strengthened . " He shrugged , then ordered , " Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , and make sure the routes lead to areas with lots of maneuvering room . " <p> " Yessir . " Jerry acknowledged the order and checked to make sure that Peters was taking notes . <p> " Now walk me through it , " Shimko ordered , and Jerry began with Sea-wolf 's careful entrance to the Barents Sea . Framed as it was by the Russian coast to the south and Novaya Zemlya on the east , it was easy to understand why the Russians considered it home waters , the same way Americans might view the Gulf of Mexico . <p> Seawolf would cross the gap from Greenland to Svalbard , under broken sea ice and hopefully bad weather . Svalbard was a cluster of islands under Norwegian control . It usually hugged the southern edge of the North Pole 's permanent ice cap . The sub would pass south of the islands , then turn southeast to conceal her approach as much as possible . <p> Once in the Barents Sea , Seawolf would slow , creeping into areas used by the Russians for fleet training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn on a Rus sian chart , but they were used by the Russian Navy to manage their at- sea training during the Arctic summer . <p> The U.S. did n't have those charts , of course . Careful observation of Russian exercises by satellites and submarines and other methods had given <p> U.S. intelligence a pretty good idea of where they were . <p> American and other Western submarines had prowled those waters for years , watching the Russian Fleet practice their craft , recording signals , sometimes even recovering expended weapons . The Russians watched for outsiders , sometimes finding them , often not . Although the training areas were in international waters and thus theoretically open to anyone , the Russians could make eavesdroppers feel very unwelcome . <p> Lately Russian antisurveillance measures had become so stringent that it was not only difficult to get close enough to gather any useful intelligence , it had become downright hazardous to anyone making the attempt . And with a shrinking submarine fleet , the U.S. Navy was experiencing difficulties providing comprehensive coverage during the exercise cycle . <p> So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant acoustic recording devices on the seabed to monitor Rus sian activity . The information could be recovered later by another submarine when the area was quiet . These sensors would gather some of the raw intelligence data that a submarine would normally be tasked to collect . There would be other Western assets that would still be watching , but their observations would be from a safe distance . <p> Obviously , secrecy was paramount . If the Russians discovered the sensors ' existence , they could be easily destroyed or recovered . Besides the embarrassment , and loss of valuable intelligence , the devices used some very sophisticated technology  --  not the sort the U.S. wanted to share . <p> Jerry showed the XO how Seawolf would approach each survey site and launch a UUV , an automated underwater robot , to check out the bottom topography and to mea sure the ambient acoustic conditions . Several sites would be examined in each exercise area . The collected data would be used by the bright boys back home to compute the exact sensor locations , which would be planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , the XO quizzed Jerry about GPS satellite coverage , deviation from standard sonar conditions , marine life in the area , and the effects of the aurora borealis on communications . Jerry 's ready answers pleased Shimko , but earned him a crack about " smartass know- it- all . " <p> " Make those changes I mentioned and we 'll brief the Skipper tomorrow at nineteen hundred . " <p> " Aye , aye , XO , " Jerry replied . Shimko finished , " That 's all , then . " <p> Jerry turned to help his chief gather up the maps and notes , but Shimko called him aside . <p> " How 's the watch bill coming ? " the XO asked . <p> " It 's done , " Jerry answered , " I 'll have a smooth copy on your desk this afternoon . " <p> " Fine . " Having watched Jerry mentally shift gears , Shimko hit him with the real question . " Who 's taking her out ? " he asked , in a voice slightly softer than normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only made up the underway watch bill , he managed the ju nior officers ' training . Conning Seawolf when she got under way was an important learning opportunity for a junior member of the wardroom . <p> " Hayes , " Jerry replied followed by a short pause , " and Palmer . With your permission , sir . " <p> Shimko frowned . " Palmer , " he repeated , working through the idea and not enjoying the implications . " After the hash he made of his last underway , why should I give him another chance ? " <p> Jerry hoped the question was rhetorical . " Because he ca n't qualify without it , " he replied earnestly . " Because he learns from his mistakes . " <p> " And if he flubs , it 's too late to replace him , " Shimko replied acidly . " Seawolf is not just a training aid , and I 'm not inclined to risk the boat as we leave for an important mission . " <p> " Lieutenant Palmer would be pleased to answer any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry replied positively . <p> " Fine . I 'll see both of you right after lunch tomorrow . " <p> " Day after tomorrow ? " Jerry replied hopefully . " They 'll be loading weapons all day today and most of tomorrow . " <p> Shimko sighed . " All right . Day after tomorrow , then . " He paused , then said , " You ca n't carry him forever , Jerry . " <p> " He 'll find his feet , sir . He just needs a little more time . " <p> " I hope so , for everyone 's sake , " the XO answered as he left the wardroom . <p> Peters and Hudson had finished collecting all the charts , and Jerry double- checked them as they left to make sure nothing was left behind . Everyone on a nuclear submarine had some sort of security clearance , but it did n't pay to get sloppy with sensitive documents . Although he might have more room in a jail cell , the food was worse . <p> Chandler was not in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expected the man to be waiting outside the wardroom , but he begrudged the time it would take to find the commo , and he could n't trust Chandler to find him . <p> Matthew Lloyd Chandler III was a good officer . The son of a successful submarine admiral , he 'd just made lieutenant and seemed destined for higher rank . But as communications officer and Jerry 's subordinate on the ship 's organizational chart , Chandler seemed to be a drain on his time , not an asset . <p> He finally found Chandler in the ship 's office . When he saw Jerry , the lieutenant spoke first . " I got those questions answered , sir . I should have looked in the manual , " he said humbly , gesturing to a fat notebook on a rack over the yeoman 's desk . <p> Chandler 's formality irked Jerry . He did work for Jerry , and it was of course proper to address officers se nior to oneself as " sir , " but naval custom allowed officers who worked together and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The submarine service was even more informal . And any pretext for formality had been removed two months ago , when Chandler had been promoted from lieutenant j.g. to full lieutenant , the same rank as Jerry . <p> " Petty Officer Wallace helped me find what I needed . " Chandler nodded toward the yeoman , sounding grateful . <p> Then why did n't you ask him in the first place ? Jerry thought , but suppressed the urge to say it . He simply said , " Good . Then are they ready for me ? " <p> " Yessir . " Chandler handed over the forms . <p> Jerry reviewed them on the spot , since their next stop was the ship 's office . They were neatly filled out . He took his time , but could n't decide if he was pleased or irritated to find everything in order . <p> As Jerry read , the phone in the ship 's office buzzed , and Wallace answered . He listened for a moment , then replied , " I 'll tell him . " Wallace turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's in officers ' country . " <p> " I 'll meet him there , " Jerry answered . He initialed the forms and handed them to the yeoman . <p> Chief Hudson was waiting by Jerry 's stateroom with a third-class petty officer Jerry did n't recognize . The young sailor nervously came to attention when he saw Jerry , and Mitchell let him stay that way for the moment . <p> " Lieutenant Mitchell , this is Petty Officer Dennis Rountree , " Hudson reported . " He 's just come aboard , fresh from school . Here 's his service jacket . " <p> Jerry opened the file and skimmed it quickly . Twenty years old , although he looked about fourteen . Good scores , no disciplinary problems . He 'd expected that , but it never hurt to check . " At ease , Petty Officer Rountree . " Jerry smiled as he said it , trying to really put the young man at ease . " Welcome aboard . You 're coming to a great boat with a handpicked crew . Since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments to feel proud , before Chief Hudson starts working your tail off . We 're getting under way in eight days , and we 'll be gone for a while . Are you ready for that ? Everything squared away ashore ? " <p> " Yes , sir . I ca n't wait , " Rountree replied enthusiastically . <p> Jerry 's smile matched the chief 's . " Keep that attitude , and you 'll do well . " Turning to Hudson , he asked , " Did you phone the XO ? " <p> " Yessir , he said to see him when we 're done . " <p> It was only a few steps from Jerry 's stateroom to the XO 's . Jerry knocked twice , lightly , and waited to hear " Come " before turning the knob . <p> Lieutenant Commander Shimko had the neatest stateroom Jerry had ever seen . Of course , when you live in a space the size of a walk- in closet , neatness is more than just a virtue , but the XO 's room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side , separated from the opposite bulkhead by a three- foot- wide patch of linoleum deck . That bulkhead held a sink and mirror . Next to that was a closet , and next to that a fold- down desk . A chair in front of the desk took up about a third of the available floor space . <p> Any open wall space was covered with clipboards or papers taped to the bulkhead . All the papers were taped in exactly the same way , at exactly the same height . The clipboards all hung at the same height as the papers . <p> Although the stateroom could accommodate two officers , the XO customarily had the stateroom to himself , unless a guest was aboard . Shimko had converted the upper bunk into additional file space , piles of folders and papers arranged with mathematical precision . Even the in and out baskets , full almost to overflowing , managed to look organized . <p> " XO , sir , this is Electronics Technician Third Class Rountree . " Jerry offered the XO his file . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor . " Welcome aboard . Any issues or questions so far ? " <p> " No , sir , " Rountree replied quickly . <p> " Good , let me see if the Captain 's free . " He stepped down the passageway to a door with Seawolf 's seal on it . It showed a snarling wolf 's head rising from the blue ocean against a black background . A black banner across the top held the boat 's name in red . Another banner under the seal read , " Cave Lupum "  --  " Beware the Wolf . " Underneath the seal , a gleaming brass plaque read " Captain . " Jerry could hear music from the captain 's stateroom ; it was the bugle solo from the skipper 's favorite song , " Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy . " For some strange reason , their captain loved 1930s  --  1940s- era music . Shimko sighed , rapped once , then cracked the door . " Petty Officer Rountree , sir . " <p> Jerry heard the music stop , and then the captain say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the door opened the rest of the way . The XO stepped back and motioned for the young sailor to step forward . Jerry and Chief Hudson remained at ease , but Rountree snapped to attention . <p> Commander Thomas Rudel looked more like a bank teller than a sea captain . He was n't tall , did n't have a barrel chest , and did n't even have a bellowing voice . Jerry had seldom ever heard him raise it , or even speak sharply . <p> He did n't need to raise it . The crew had learned that Rudel was incredibly smart , eminently practical , and at times very funny . The XO tended toward the more satirical " phortune cookie filosophy , " but Rudel 's humor was subtle and dry  --  you had to listen for it , but it was worth the effort . <p> " Welcome aboard , Petty Officer Rountree . " Rudel sounded genuinely glad to have the young man aboard . " You 're joining a great boat with a great crew . ' Great ' means getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . You ca n't do one without the other . Everyone in the chain of command , which now includes you , watches out above , below , and to either side for his shipmates . . . " <p> Jerry did n't mean to tune out the captain 's welcome- aboard speech , but he 'd heard it several times , including on his own arrival aboard . And he could n't listen to Rudel 's speech without flashing back to his first boat , and his first captain . <p> Jerry 's tour aboard USS Memphis had turned out well , but that was in spite of Commander Lowell Hardy , Memphis 's skipper . Where Rudel called on nobler motives , Hardy had ruled by fear . Jerry 's first meeting with his first captain was a preemptive ass- chewing that had left Jerry questioning his career choice . <p> Hardy had compensated for his intimidating manner by micromanaging the entire boat . Any good submariner was detail- oriented , but focused on his own job . Hardy did n't trust anyone 's skills or motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and the enlisted men . <p> Hardy ruled by fear because that 's what he felt . His fear of someone else 's error ruining his record was transformed by the crew into fear of doing anything without first checking with the captain . It was no way to run any naval vessel , much less a submarine . A fire on board had caused serious damage to Memphis , and the crew 's response showed Hardy that there were better ways to lead men . <p> He 'd just started to trust Jerry when they 'd been attacked by Rus sian forces . . . <p> Mitchell snapped back to the present when Commander Rudel finished his speech with his trademark line : " Now go work your tail off . " Jerry realized he 'd used the same phrase when he welcomed Rountree aboard , but he was n't worried about copying Rudel 's command style . <p> Hudson and Rountree headed aft . Jerry noted the smile on Rountree 's face . The skipper had that effect on people . Excusing himself , Jerry headed forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find Palmer , and check on the UUVs . <p> Lieutenant ( j.g . ) Jeff Palmer was a weak link in Seawolf 's chain of command . It was n't enough to have intelligence or determination or even a good attitude . Nobody got through the nuclear pipeline and sub school without those abilities , but they were n't enough to get Jeff Palmer qualified . <p> Every submariner had to " qualify " aboard his boat . It meant knowing every system aboard in detail , not just the equipment you worked with in your own job . In an emergency , if the boat suffered some sort of accident or was damaged in a fight , everyone aboard had to know what to do . The candidate had to be able to draw the air , hydraulic , electrical , and other vital systems from memory . He had to find valves and damage- control equipment while blindfolded . In a real emergency , with the lights out , or the air filled with thick smoke , conditions could be much worse . In addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and understood . And it did n't hurt to have the secondary procedures committed to memory as well . <p> Both officers and enlisted went through the pro cess . When they qualified , the captain awarded them their " dolphins , " an insignia worn on their shirt . Officers had gold dolphins , enlisted men silver . Like an aviator 's wings , they represented a lot of work , and were worn with pride . <p> Jerry 's first qualification , aboard Memphis , had been an ordeal , for many reasons . Still , he 'd done it in record time , in a single patrol . Normally , an officer new to subs would take about a year and a half to qualify . Palmer had been at it now for seventeen months , and had run into trouble from the very start . <p> Part of the qualification process were " murder boards , " oral quizzes by a group of officers on a particu ar topic . Palmer could study the manuals and practice the procedures until they were second nature , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many questions in rapid succession caused him to freeze , or give answers that were obviously wrong . Men who could n't handle pressure did not belong on a sub . <p> Palmer was in the torpedo room , along with Torpedoman Chief Johnson , his division chief , and several of the torpedomen . They were loading weapons for the upcoming mission , which on a Seawolf-class sub took quite a while . <p> The torpedo room on modern U.S. nuclear subs is located aft of the bow , not in it like the old- style WWII boats . The bow on Seawolf was completely taken up by three large sonar arrays , including a monstrously huge sonar " ball , " covered with passive hydrophones . The eight torpedo tubes , four to a side , were mounted in port and starboard nests complete with individual launching system , and angled outward . Modern guided torpedoes were smart enough to turn after they were launched and head for their prey . <p> Jerry had been torpedo officer on Memphis , and was still impressed by the scale of Seawolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warload of twenty- six torpedoes and missiles . Seawolf could load fifty , and the racks for them filled a two- story compartment . Seawolf 's tubes were bigger as well , thirty inches in diameter instead of twenty- one inches . Unfortunately , the U.S. Navy never developed thirty- inch torpedoes , so the tubes were sleeved to accept the standard twenty- one-inch weapons . The space was crowded with weapons and the machinery to move them , but to Jerry it was as large as a cathedral . <p> Unusually , daylight and sounds from outside filtered into the space . A loading ramp angled from Seawolf 's deck , just aft of the sail , down through two decks into the torpedo room . Because Mark 48 torpedoes are twenty and a half feet long and weigh almost two tons , a special loading tray had been rigged to control their downward journey . Torpedomen handled the massive weapons as if they were made of glass , while Chief Johnson watched their every move . One torpedoman wore a set of sound- powered phones , communicating with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway , taking in the division 's progress and deciding if this was a good time to talk to Palmer . He was reluctant to distract men loading explosives , but the jaygee saw him and walked over . <p> " What 's up , Nav ? " Palmer 's good mood almost gave Jerry another excuse to delay telling him , but it had to be done . <p> " You 're going to conn the boat out when we leave on the fifteenth , " Jerry said simply . <p> Palmer acted like he 'd been shot . " Oh , no . " If he had n't been leaning on a fitting , he might have fallen down . He was obviously remembering his last attempt , which had cost the navy a splintered piling and nearly a crushed sonar dome . <p> " You need this ticket punched , Jeff . " Jerry 's tone was firm , but positive . <p> Jeff Palmer was taller than Jerry , though slim . He seemed to shrink as he reluctantly nodded agreement . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you 'll have to answer questions about underway procedures for the XO day after tomorrow . He 'll see you in his stateroom right after lunch . " <p> A pale redhead , Palmer turned white . " He 'll grind me up like hamburger ! I 'll never be able to satisfy him . " <p> " Do you think the XO 's going to deliberately trip you up ? " <p> " No , but you know what will happen . " <p> Jerry sighed , but managed to do it on the inside . Palmer had developed a real confidence problem , but Jerry was n't going to blow sunshine at him . That was n't his job , and it did n't really help the guy . Still , he needed to be positive . <p> " Jeff , you know the material , you 've proven that to me . If you want to stay in subs , you 've got to show the XO you know it , then use it to get Sea-wolf under way safely . " <p> " What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then I 'll have Santana take her out , " Jerry answered flatly . Ensign Santana was the electrical officer , and was also working on his qualification . To himself , Jerry added , " And you 'll be off the boat and out of subs the day we get back from patrol . " <p> " Who will be the OOD ? " asked Palmer hesitantly . <p> " Mr. Hayes , " Jerry replied , and then with a slight grin , " And yes , he knows what he 's getting into . " <p> " Thanks , Nav . I 'm not too popular with my department head right now . And I do n't think I could be up on the bridge with him again . At least not right away . " <p> " You 're right , he 's not happy with your progress , " said Jerry frankly . " And yes , he was upset about your earlier attempt , and not just because he was the OOD . It 's his job to push you , Jeff . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would he have spent all those hours working with you ? " <p> " No , sir , " answered Palmer quietly . <p> " All right then . Get your act together and show him you are capable of conning a boat on the surface . You know what to do . You just need to muster the intestinal fortitude and do it . Okay ? " <p> " Yes , sir . I will , sir . " <p> " Correct answer , Mr. Palmer , " remarked Jerry . " Now you 'd better get back to supervising the weapons loading evolution . " " Aye , aye , sir , " Palmer replied with a little more confidence . " And Nav . . . thanks . " <p> Tuesday afternoon USS Seawolf , executive officer 's stateroom <p> When Jeff Palmer knocked on the XO 's door and went inside , Jerry stayed in the passageway . The XO had required Jerry to be here , but Palmer would have to answer Shimko 's questions alone . <p> Which was as it should be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he asked himself . Not moral support . The XO had left the door cracked , so Jerry could hear Palmer 's performance . <p> " Mr. Palmer . What will the tides be when we get under way ? " <p> " Ebb tide , sir . Two feet above mean low water , with a two- knot current . " <p> " And the weather ? " <p> " High scattered clouds , light winds from the south , about sixty-five degrees . That 's as of this morning according to the NOAA website . I 'll check ... " <p> " What rudder and bells will you start with ? " " Well , sir , last time I used back one- third and twenty  --  " The XO interrupted Palmer . " I did n't ask for a history lesson , mister . <p> What rudder and bells would you use this time , if I let you take her out ? " <p> There was a pause , a little longer than Jerry would have liked , and then Palmer said , " The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry started to worry . He thought Palmer would last longer before getting rattled , but the XO knew where to apply pressure . Which might be what he wanted Jerry to see . <p> " What orders are you giving the tug ? " <p> " None yet , sir . I have to get our stern swung out . . . " <p> " Wo n't that smash our bow into the pier ? " The XO 's tone was neutral , with just a tinge of concern . He was challenging Palmer 's answers now . Palmer stammered , but he knew the answer . " I have to limit the swing to no more than thirty degrees . There 's a tower on the north shore you can use as a mark . As the rudder swings past that point , I tell the tug to start backing . . . " <p> " The tug 's suffered an engineering casualty . " Shimko 's tone was still flat , but he spoke quickly . <p> " Sir ? " <p> " The tug captain tells you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ca n't give you any help . " <p> Jerry did n't hear an answer right away , and counted the seconds . He imagined the wheels spinning in Palmer 's head , and hoped they were finding traction . <p> " Put number three line back over , then shift to ahead one-third . Use side force from the screw and pivot on number three to push the bow away from the pier . " Palmer sounded tentative . If Jerry heard it , so did the XO . <p> " But you 're using ahead engines . Wo n't that drive our bow into the pier ? " More concern in the XO 's tone , mixed with skepticism . He was really leaning on Palmer . Shimko remembered Palmer 's first underway as well . He knew Palmer would be worried about the bow . <p> " I 'd only leave it on for a moment , sir . We have some sternway . As soon as our sternway was off . . . " <p> " But what about the tug ? As the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're big enough to cave in his hull . " <p> That was a sucker question . Since the tug was up against Seawolf 's side , with fenders rigged , there was no chance of damage . Jerry waited for Palmer 's reply . And waited . <p> " Sir , I 'm not sure ... " Palmer 's voice was more than unsure . <p> " The tug skipper 's on the radio , yelling that he 's holding you personally responsible for any damage to his vessel . " <p> " Sir ... " <p> Jerry was waiting for Palmer to implode when the door to the captain 's stateroom opened and Rudel stepped into the passageway . Jerry stepped back out of the way , and the skipper politely nodded to him as he walked to the XO 's stateroom . Knocking on the half- open door , he walked in without waiting for a reply . <p> Jerry heard him ask lightly , " So XO , what 's the situation ? " Shimko quickly summarized the scenario and pointedly remarked , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short pause , he added , " Mr. Palmer is liable for any damage to the tug . " <p> Jerry was tempted to peek inside , but he did n't really need to , and certainly did n't want to be seen . He listened to Rudel ask softly , " Mr. Palmer , do you know the answer to the XO 's question ? " His question demanded an answer , but at the same time had a positive tone . <p> After a short pause , Jerry heard Palmer say , " Yes , sir . I do . " After another pause , he answered , " There ca n't be any damage , because he 's tight alongside us . " <p> Rudel asked , " But wo n't he keep our bow from moving out from the pier ? " <p> " No sir , we 're so much bigger than the tug , with a much deeper draft , and he 's at our pivot point anyway . Then , as soon as our headway 's off and we 've swung more parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and get us moored again . " <p> " Why would you do that , mister ? " The XO 's voice was still level . " I thought the idea was to get under way . " <p> " Not with the tug in the way . Besides , he 's broken down and we ca n't leave him adrift in the channel . " <p> " Very good , Mr. Palmer , never abandon a mariner in distress . " The cap-tain 's praise was followed by a quick " Carry on , " and he stepped out of the XO 's stateroom and back to his own . As he passed Jerry , the skipper winked at him , smiling . Jerry felt himself smiling as well . He was sure now Palmer would pass . <p> Rudel 's kind words were the only praise Palmer received . The XO grilled him for another twenty minutes , and there were more trick questions as well as hard ones . Jerry knew the XO was n't really testing Palmer 's knowledge , but his presence of mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " All right , Mr. Palmer , I 'm satisfied that you 're able to properly get Seawolf under way next Monday . Continue your preparations . The Navigator and I will review them Monday after quarters . " <p> Jeff Palmer stepped out of the XO 's stateroom , pale but smiling . Jerry and Palmer walked some distance away from the XO 's stateroom before either spoke . " Compared to that , the underway will be a breeze . " Palmer sounded stressed but pleased . <p> " Just hope you 're right , Jeff . Things can get past you before you know you 're in trouble . " Jerry gestured back toward the XO 's stateroom . " In there , you knew you were being asked a question . On the bridge , you 'll have to ask yourself the questions , as well as answer them . " <p> Palmer 's expression became more serious , but his smile did n't go away completely . " Believe me , sir , I get it . My first underway taught me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with explosives and a nuclear reactor . If we do n't stay on our toes , we 're screwed . " <p> " Learning from your mistakes is a good thing . But dwelling on them is not , " advised Jerry sternly . " You lost the bubble last time and it 's been holding you back . This time you need to stay in control , which means you have to think ahead . We may move slowly , but a submarine on the surface reacts to your helm orders just as slowly  --  so keep your wits about you and plan accordingly . " <p> " I will , Nav . And this time , I wo n't screw up . " <p> " Sounds good , Jeff . Let 's plan to meet on Friday , you and Mr. Hayes , to do a final review , okay ? " <p> " Yes , sir . I 'll inform Will . " <p> " Very well , Mr. Palmer , carry on .
