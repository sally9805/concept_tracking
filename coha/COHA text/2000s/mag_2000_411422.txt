Working with African refugees teaches one American that we are all connected . // Before I was ordained , I spent two years in Kenya with the Jesuit Refugee Service working with refugees from across East Africa . My assignment , at the Mikono Centre in Nairobi , was to help refugees start small businesses , or , in the antiseptic lingo of relief agencies , " income-generating activities . " My two years ran from 1992 through 1994during the time of both the famine in Somalia and the genocide in Rwanda-and we saw not only dramatically increased flows of refugees into the dry Kenyan countryside , but also an awakened interest on the part of the West in the concerns of East Africa . The largest group of refugees with whom I worked were Rwandans . Many had settled in Nairobi in the I960s and I970s , following the continuing violence between the Hutu and Tutsi . Early on , a friend asked innocently , " Why are they still here ? What 's wrong with going home to Rwanda ? " A few months later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first few days it seemed too unbelievable to be true . Information was sketchy . There had been rumors of massacres , duly reported in the Nairobi papers but largely ignored elsewhere . Finally , news began trickling in . The numbers were raised daily . In time , we realized that the worst news , the most incredible , was the most accurate : 800,000 were dead , with 1 million refugees living in camps with little water and no food . Cholera began to spread in the camps . Five thousand who had taken refuge in one church were slaughtered . Neighbors turned on one another . Kigali was nearly deserted . The rivers in Rwanda were clogged with bodies , some of which began to float into Lake Victoria . The papers published gruesome pictures of bloated corpses . For the Rwandan refugees in Nairobi , many of whom had been patiently saving money for the time when it was safe to return home , the lack of information from their families , coupled with horrific pictures in the newspapers , was unbearable . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victims of the current massacre . There was no way for them to contact their families , and so they waited like the rest of the world for news . Ironically , while the diplomats fled , the Rwandans living in Nairobi seemed to want to return , driven to find out what had happened to their families . Within weeks hundreds of Rwandans appeared in Nairobi , many having fled in advance of a massacre they had long anticipated with fear-after all , they had heard the Hutu radio broadcasts for months , urging the Hutu to kill their Tutsi neighbors . They settled in slums with relatives , friends , and with Rwandans they had met on the streets of Nairobi . Photograph // Three Rwandan Jesuit priests were killed with pangas ( machetes ) at a retreat house in Kigali called the Centre Christus . The murderers separated the Jesuits and the retreatants-mostly priests and sisters  --  by ethnic group and murdered the Tutsi . Seventeen in all were killed , the very first , it was said , to be massacred in Rwanda . The rector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a soft-spoken Rwandan priest , lost most of his family in Kigali during the same week . Months later Karekezi would return to his country to work at the Centre Christus , replacing his slain Jesuit brothers . In his book Christianity and the African Imagination ( Paulines Publications Africa , 1996 ) , Father Aylward Shorter , M.Afr. , recounts the story of Sister Felicity Niyitegeka , a Hutu , aged about 60 . She was the director of the Centre Saint Pierre in Gisenyi , where she and her sisters sheltered Tutsi refugees during the genocide . When her brother , a colonel in the army , instructed Felicite to leave immediately in order to escape certain death , she wrote the following letter : Dearest Brother : Thank you for wanting to help me . I would rather die than abandon the 43 persons for whom I am responsible . Pray for us , that we may come to God . Say " goodbye " to our old mother and our brother . When I come to God , I shall pray for you . Keep well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saves us , as we hope , we shall see each other tomorrow . Your Sister , Felice Niyitegeka On April 21 , the militia arrived at the center and transported the remaining Tutsis , as well as Felicite and her sisters , to an already-prepared mass grave . They shot to death more than 20 refugees and six of the sisters , leaving Felicite for last . " I have no more reason to live , " she said , " now that you have killed all of my sisters . " But for every story of a murdered priest or sister there came rumors , a few later substantiated , of Rwandan priests and sisters who were themselves murderers or who had acted in collusion with the genocidaires . Rwanda , it was often noted , is the most Catholic country in Africa . At the airport one day , I met a Belgian priest who had worked in Rwanda for 24 years in a small mission parish . We sat on a wooden bench , as dozens of United Nations troops in their robin's-egg-blue helmets swirled about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massacres by the Belgian military , after remaining for as long as he could . He told me of the leader of the small Christian community in his parish , who was also the head catechis , the layperson responsible for instructing people in Christianity . This catechist took the lead in killing people in his village . He was an effective organizer of genocide because he knew , thanks to his role in the community , who were Hutu and who were Tutsi ( an often difficult distinction to make ) . So he led the rest of the Hutu in slaughtering his fellow parishioners with pangas . " This man , " said my priest friend , " who I thought was the best Christian in the village . " He paused and stared sadly at the pale blue helmets that encircled us . " My life , " he whispered , " has been a waste of time . " One refugee 's journey Though we had seen few refugees from outside of East Africa , I was not surprised when Kabina Sockor , a refugee from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some comments offered by the occasional refugee made me realize that the Mikono Centre had become well known in Nairobi . Kabina was a young man whose story , as he related it , was incredible . His older brother had been an officer in one of the government ministries in Liberia . During a flare-up of political hostilities in Liberia , his brother was abducted by members of a rival party . While Kabina watched , his brother was buried alive with other members of his party . " We will do the same to you , " they told him , " unless you leave . " Kabina decided to flee Liberia , leaving behind-as all refugees do-his family , his friends , his job , his home . He first traveled to the Ivory Coast , which borders Liberia , settling there as an official " full status " U.N . refugee . But after lodging with some Liberian refugees for a few months , Kabina heard rumors that Liberian soldiers were searching for him . His friends advised him to get as far away from Liberia as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and off trucks and finally ended up in Kampala , Uganda . But there were no Liberians in Uganda , and Kabina grew lonely and sad . Kabina also discovered that the U.N . would give him no help in any country other than the Ivory Coast . To discourage refugees from wandering from country to country in search of a better deal , the U.N . grants papers and status forms to refugees only in their first country of asylum . In every other country he was persona non grata . Photograph // Eventually Kabina took a truck to Nairobi , where he had heard there were many Liberian refugees and which was far from Liberia and his brother 's killers . But in Nairobi Kabina found only more misery . There were , in fact , very few refugees from Liberia . He was not permitted to remain legally in the country , and he had absolutely no money . He was begging and scrounging through garbage cans for food . Kabina reached the end of the story and stared at me with bloodshot eyes . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . He reached into his dirty pants pocket , and pulled out a creased photo . It showed him lounging on a concrete floor against a red oxide wall , wearing a pair of orange and green kitenge pants . " I made those pants , Brother , " he said . " And I can make anything . Can I have a sewing machine ? " Unfortunately , the charter of JRS prohibited us from sponsoring refugees without U.N . papers . It was a good rule : It helped to ensure that we helped only people who were truly refugees . In this case , though , it was working against someone in need who was a real refugee . But in a striking example of coincidence or God 's providence-depending on one 's beliefs ( mine was definitely the latter in this case ) - we were able to help Kabina . Stitching together a new life Mikono Centre had become a clearinghouse and meeting place for the refugees . People taped letters for one another on outside walls and caught up on news while sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lacking storage space in their cramped houses , the refugees also asked us to store things for them : fabric , clothes , wood for carving , straw for baskets . One day , Adela , a Rwandan refugee who made a living by doing tailoring and mending , appeared at our shop with her Singer 241N sewing machine , heavy table and all . At first I thought it might be broken . It was not . " Brother , " she said , holding her hands out . " My house has been burned dawn ! These thieves have taken everything , and all I have is my machine ! " As the other refugees on the benches listened to her story , Adela wept . She had lugged the heavy machine from her house over the muddy fields , a distance of about five kilometers . " Brother , can I be keeping my machine here until I get a new place ? " It was an easy request to grant . We dragged the heavy machine inside . Adela shook my hand vigorously and said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to keep it until she found a new flat , or longer if she felt it was still unsafe . " Maybe others will need it , " Adela said as she left . " They can be using it , too . " Now someone did . Because we could n't sponsor Kabina directly , I asked if he would be willing to make some caps for us with Adela 's machine . We already had dozens of bolts of vividly colored batik fabric-one of our biggest sellers-made by two industrious Rwandan women . I brought Kabina into the main showroom ; together we selected some suitable fabric . We dragged Adela 's machine out of the little bathroom , which was-owing to piles of small ebony logs and three large bales of straw-now more of a storage room . Kabina set to work in our backyard under the avocado tree . In a few hours he presented me with three batik kofias ( hats ) . They were well done ; I paid him 200 shillings , his first income in weeks . Thereafter Kabina visited us daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's machine . After a few weeks , he had earned enough money to rent a small flat . After a few months , he was able to purchase his own machine and started doing light tailoring for his neighbors . When I decided to return home I wanted to give the refugees time to get used to the idea . Their lives were replete with departures , transitory friendships , and impermanence . So a few months before my departure I put up a note on the window of the Mikono Centre in English , Swahili , French , Amharic , Luganda , and Kinyarwanda . It explained the reason for my departure-continuing my studies for ordination in the States-and assured them of the continued support of JRS for them and their businesses . Posting the note in the window also occasioned the expression of good wishes and affection from the refugees . Some brought me notes , some carried gifts , and others brought their children and parents for me to say goodbye to and bless . All of this I was quite unprepared for and found tremendously affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Michael told me that Kabina Sockor was waiting on the porch to see me . His face was wet with tears as he entered the small office . I was surprised ; not only do African men rarely weep in public , but I also knew that Kabina had had a difficult life-perhaps I expected him to be " tough . " I closed the door . After he sat down and wiped his eyes on his sleeve , I asked him what was wrong . " You 're leaving , " he said . I quickly reassured him , reminding him that Brother Michael would continue to work here and that the Mikono Centre would continue to help him out . He lowered his head . " No , Brother . You are not understanding . " And so I again attempted to reassure him . " You know , " I said , " even though things have been difficult for you , people here will take care of you . And you 've come so far . You 've got a flat , your own tailoring business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't continue to improve for you . " " You are still not understanding , Brother , " he said . His head sank , and he closed his eyes . Tears dropped onto his jacket . Kabina reached over and grabbed my arm . We were sitting next to one another , on low wooden chairs with cushions . He turned his damp face to mine . " You 're my brother , " he said . And I understood . I understood exactly what he meant . Of course , I had heard the gospel stories where Jesus says that we are all brothers and sisters , that we 're all part of the Body of Christ , that " no man is an island , " and all of that , but I never really understood it before . Now I understood . I was Kabina 's brother . And he was mine . I was responsible for him , to help him out , to be his friend . By virtue of our time together and our concern for one another , we were truly brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . And you 're mine , " I said , finally . Connected by hope A few weeks after I returned to the States , the horrific news of the genocide in Rwanda began to dominate the media 's attention . Every day brought new pictures , new reports of slaughter , and more insistent pleas for help from the world community . One day I watched television footage of the Tutsi refugees in a camp across the Zairian border . I caught the briefest glimpse of a thin , young Rwandan boy huddled under a blanket , the kind of cheap blanket that is sold everywhere in Nairobi , made of multicolored pressed fabric scraps . The kind of blanket , in fact , that I had on my own bed in Nairobi . It was a strange moment ; I felt at once painfully separated from this boy and profoundly connected . So now , a few years of ter I left Kenya , I still meet the refugeesthough in different ways . I no longer find them waiting for me by the dozens in the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeep to visit them at home , nor do they flag me down by the side of dusty roads . Instead , I meet them in letters , in prayers , and in memory . A few things I know now that I did n't then . For one thing , I understand that my own struggles broke open my heart and enabled me to connect with the refugees on a deeper level . I suppose that if I had felt completely in control of things , I might not have experienced the love from the refugees so profoundly , nor have been able to love them as fully . In my weakness , then , I was more able , I think , to meet them as brothers and sisters-as friends . " In my weakness I am strong , " said Saint Paul . Maybe this is something of what he meant . It is also clear that the refugees taught me how to love in a new way . One of the challenges of religious life , at least for me , has been learning what chastity means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Kenya , spending time with refugees like Kabina Sockor , that I understood how satisfying it can be to love chastely , that is , to love many people with your whole heart and to accept the love that comes freely in return . Come to think of it , that 's the challenge for any sort of life , religious or not . Photograph // I also know how connected we remainstill-through the miles and with the passage of time . And I know that if I am connected to my refugee friends thousands of miles away , then I am also connected to the refugee boy huddled under the blanket , that is , to a person I 've never met . And , if this is true , then I 'm connected to everyone else in the world . So this I know . But I still do n't know why the poor , who work so hard and suffer so much , are often rewarded only by more hardship and ever more pain . I do , though , understand that in confronting these painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in facing hardships that the refugees showed me the value of something else , something good-that is , hope . It was this hope that gave their work such meaning and value , and , I believe , enabled the refugees to push on-pole , pole as they would say . It was this hope that they passed on to me during my time in East Africa . And the source and ground of this hope , I know , is God . " The reign of God is like a mustard seed , " said Jesus . " When sown upon the ground it is the smallest of all seeds , but when it has grown it is the greatest of all the bushes , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches . " So while the refugees " hope is a small thing , perhaps covered by the dirt of genocide and poverty and despair , I also know that it is there , dormant , awaiting water , but always ready to sprout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked still accompany me . I close my eyes and remember them when I pray . I hear their voices ; I see their faces ; I think of their sorrows and their joys ; I remember their hope . And I am very grateful .
