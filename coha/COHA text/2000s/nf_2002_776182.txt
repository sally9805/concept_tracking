CULTURAL COLLISIONS on the GREAT PLAINS // I AM FROM // I am from Avis and Frank , Agnes and Fred , Glessie May and Mark . // From the Ozark Mountains and the high plains of Eastern Colorado , // From mountain snowmelt and lazy southern creeks filled with water moccasins. // I am from oatmeal eaters , gizzard eaters , haggis and raccoon eaters. // I 'm from craziness , darkness , sensuality , and humor . // From intense do-gooders struggling through ranch winters in the 1920s. // I 'm from " If you ca n't say anything nice about someone do n't say anything " and " Pretty is as pretty does " and " Shit-mucklety brown " and " Damn it all to hell . " // I 'm from no-dancing-or-drinking Methodists , but cards were okay except on Sunday , and from tent-meeting Holy Rollers , // From farmers , soldiers , bootleggers , and teachers . // I 'm from Schwinn girl 's bike , 1950 Mercury two-door , and West Side Story . // I 'm from coyotes , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harvest moon over Nebraska cornfields. // I 'm from muddy Platte and Republican , // from cottonwood and mulberry , tumbleweed and switchgrass // from Willa Cather , Walt Whitman , and Janis Joplin , // My own sweet dance unfolding against a cast of women in aprons and barefoot men in overalls . // As a girl in Beaver City , I played the globe game . Sitting outside in the thick yellow weeds , or at the kitchen table while my father made bean soup , I would shut my eyes , put my finger on the globe , and spin it . Then I would open my eyes and imagine what it was like in whatever spot my finger was touching . What were the streets like , the sounds , the colors , the smells ? What were the people doing there right now ? // I felt isolated in Beaver City , far away from any real action . We were a small town of white Protestants surrounded by cow pastures and wheat fields . I had no contact with people who were different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I knew nothing of them , not even the names of the tribes who lived in my area . I had never seen a black person or a Latino . Until I read The Diary of Anne Frank , I had never heard of Jewish people . // Adults talked mostly about crops , pie , and rainfall . I could n't wait to grow up and move someplace exotic and faraway , and living where I did , every place appeared faraway and exotic . When I read Tolstoy 's book on the little pilgrim who walked all over the world , I vowed to become that pilgrim and to spend my life seeing everything and talking to everyone . // As a young adult , I escaped for a while . I lived in San Francisco , Mexico , London , and Madrid . But much to my surprise , I missed the wheat fields , the thunderstorms , and the meadowlarks . I returned to Nebraska in my mid-twenties , married , raised a family , worked as a psychologist , and ate a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until recently I thought I had to choose between loving a particular rural place and experiencing all the beautiful diversity of the world . // Before the Europeans arrived , Nebraska was home to many Indian tribes . The Omaha , the Ponca , the Pawnee , and the Nemaha lived in the east , the Lakota Sioux in the west . In the late 1800s immigrants from Europe pushed out the Native Americans . Wave after wave of new pioneers broke over Nebraska and we became a state of Scots , Irish , British , Czechs , Swedes , and Danes . For a while , we had so many Germans that many schools held classes in German . But after World War I , when nativist sentiments swept our state , our unicameral made instruction in German illegal . // Mexican workers came to build the railroads and to work on farms and in meatpacking . African Americans came to farm and to work in our cities . Nebraska 's first free black person , Sally Bayne , moved to Omaha in 1854 , and an all-black colony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X was born in Omaha in 1925. // Even though people of color have a rich history in our state and , of course , the Native Americans were here first , our state 's identity the last 150 years has been mainly European . Until recently , a mixed marriage meant a Catholic married to a Methodist . After World War II , so many Latvians came here that we became the official site of the Latvian government in exile . Our jokes were yawners about farmers or Lutherans- " What did the farmer say after he won a million dollars in the lottery ? " " Thank God I have enough money to farm a few more years . " Or , " Wherever four Lutherans are gathered there is always a fifth . " // However , in the last fifteen years something surprising has happened . It began with the boat people , mostly Vietnamese and Cambodians , coming in after the Vietnam War . In the 1980s Lincoln began having a few Asian markets , a Vietnamese Catholic church , a Buddhist temple , and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Mexican migrant workers , who had long done seasonal work in our area , bought houses and settled down . Refugees from the wars in Central America trickled in. // The real change occurred in the 1990s . Because Lincoln had almost no unemployment and a relatively low cost of living , we were selected by the U. S. Office of Refugee Resettlement as a preferred community for newly arrived refugees . Now we are one of the top-twenty cities in America for new arrivals from abroad . Our nonwhite population has grown 128 percent since 1990 . We are beginning to look like East Harlem . // Suddenly , our supermarkets and schools are bursting with refugees from Russia , Serbia , Croatia , Bosnia , Hungary , and Ethiopia . Our Kurdish , Sudanese , and Somali populations are rapidly increasing . Even as I write this , refugees from Afghanistan , Liberia , and Sierra Leone are coming into our community . Some are educated and from Westernized places . Increasingly , we have poor and uneducated refugees . We have children from fifty different nationalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Our obituary column shows who came here early in the 1900s . It is filled with Hrdvys , Andersens , Walenshenksys , and Muellers . But the births column , which reflects recent immigration patterns , has many Ali , Nguyen , and Martinez babies . By midcentury , less than half our population will be non-Latino white . We are becoming a brown state in a brown nation . // Lincoln has often been described by disgruntled locals and insensitive outsiders as the middle of nowhere , but now it can truthfully be called the middle of everywhere . We are a city of juxtapositions . Next to the old man in overalls selling sweet corn at the farmers ' market , a Vietnamese couple sells long beans , bitter melons , and fresh lemongrass . A Yemeni girl wearing a veil stands next to a football fan in his Big Red jacket . Beside McDonald 's is a Vietnamese karaoke bar . Wagey Drug has a sign in the window that says , TARJETAS EN ESPA ? OL SE VENDEN AQUI . On the Fourth of July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-seventh Street , among the signs for the Good Neighbor Center , Long John Silver 's , Fat Pat 's Pizza , Snowflakes , and Jiffy Lube , I see signs for Mohammed 's Barber Shop , Jai Jai 's Hair Salon , Kim Ngo 's jewelry , Pho 's Vietnamese Caf ? , and Nguyen 's Tae-Kwon Do . // We celebrate many holidays-Tet , Cinco de Mayo , Rosh Hashanah , and Ramadan . At our jazz concerts , Vietnamese families share benches with Kurdish and Somali families . When my neighbor plays a pickup basketball game in the park , he plays with Bosnian , Iranian , Nigerian , and Latino players . I am reminded of the New Yorker cartoon which pictured a restaurant with a sign reading , RANCHO IL WOK DE PARIS , FEATURING TEX-MEX , ITALIAN , ASIAN , AND FRENCH CUISINES. // Women in veils exchange information with Mexican grandmothers in long black dresses . Laotian fathers smoke beside Romanian and Serbian dads . By now , every conceivable kind of grocery store exists in our city . And the ethnic shelves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry jicama and cilantro . Shoppers can buy pitas , tortillas , egg rolls , wraps , and breads from all over the world . My most recent cab driver was a Nigerian school administrator who fled his country because he was in a pro-democracy group . S. J. Perelman 's description of Bangkok- " It seemed to combine the Hannibal , Missouri , of Mark Twain 's childhood with Beverly Hills , the Low Countries , and Chinatown " - could now apply to Lincoln .
