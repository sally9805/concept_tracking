Oh , no , no , no the best dinner I ever had was at Chez Louis , " said Jonathan Bradshaw , his face glowing reverently at the memory . " The appetizer alone " His partner , Brian Lemon , nodded eagerly in agreement as he chewed a bit of meat . " What was it ? " Nathan Breslow asked . " Ris de veau la financireone of the great classic fillings for bouches . " " Ahhh ... " the assembly responded . All except me . I had spent the past two hours tensing the muscles behind my eyes to keep them from rolling to the back of my head . I was getting a headache . " The braised sweetbreads garnished with truffles , mushrooms , and olives were absolutely beyond reproach , " Jonathan continued . " Now , the soup ... " Brian nodded again , making little mewing noises . " The soup was velout d'avocat frapp ! " He launched into a description of this dish in alarming detail . The table was set with obviously expensive crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the family for years I was afraid to cut all the way through my cornish game hen for fear of scraping the knife on the surface of the plate . The tablecloth was white lace , and glowing in the center of the table was a candelabra that must 've come from an estate sale at Liberace 's . The dining room itself was uncomfortably close . A massivemahogany sideboard with ornate carvings apparently designed by the same artisan responsible for the furnishings at Hill House loomed on one wall . It was lined with grandmotherly blue-and-white china and a collection of Hummels . The other walls were covered with shelves and chockablock with tchotchkes , everything from glass animals to porcelain figurines . Jonathan and Brian , the hosts of the party , had prepared a dinner fit for a coronation : canaps that I could n't hope to describe , cold asparagus soup , salads , and the aforementioned hens , roasted until the skin was a light , crisp brown and the meat juicy and tender . Christ , I was beginning to think like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan and Brian , but at that particular moment I was ready to buy back the introduction at a premium . They were n't trying to make us feel uncomfortable ; they were being themselves . They just happened to be from Mars . The other guests , none of whom we 'd met before , seemed perfectly at ease in a conversation that sounded as if it had been cribbed from the menus of various four-star restaurants . " What was the entree ? " asked Nathan , who had been listening with rapt attention to the remembrance of our host 's favorite dinner . " Oh ! " Jonathan replied with a satisfied purr . He turned to his partner . " Do you want to tell them ? " Brian nodded again . " Darne de saumon au Champagne ! " " Well , I understood one word , " I muttered to Peter as the other couples exclaimed noisily . He coughed . " How was it ? " Eli said breathlessly . He was Nathan 's better half . " Perfection " said Jonathan with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dessert was fresh strawberries wrapped in crepes and covered with a custard sauce flavored with Grand Marnier . " " Ahhh ! " said the couples , leaning back in their chairs in unison . They were beginning to sound like a congregation : " Crepes be with you , " said the priest . " And also with you , " the congregation replied . Amen . I mean , I have nothing against food pornthat excessive epicurean elitism that some of our acquaintances enter intoexcept that it 's like regular porn : I 'd rather be engaged in the activity than watching it . Or listening to it . " Well ! The best dinner we ever had ... " said Leonard Weise , turning to his partner , Sammie . " You remember , do n't you ? " " Of course ! At La Scala ! " " In Italy ? " I blurted out , my mouth falling open . Sammie blinked at me . " No , in Rogers Park . " He turned back to the other gourmands . " The antipasto was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " said Nathan . " It 's a tart filled with sliced tomatoes , basil leaves , and grated parmesan . Olive oil is drizzled over it ... " And the congregation said Amen . " ... it 's baked , then cooled to room temperature before being served . After that was the wild mushroom soup . " " Porcini mushrooms , " Leonard clarified . The most frustrating part about this dinner was that Peter was seated to my right rather than across the table from me , so we could n't exchange meaningful glances . I suppose I could 've done it with his ear , but it does n't have the same effect , and it 's likely to be noticed by everyone except the person it 's meant for . " The pasta , " Sammie continued , " was tagliolini with asparagus . " He smacked his lips as if once again savoring the noodles . " How about that ? " I whispered to Peter . " I recognized another word . " " Much , much more delicate than spaghetti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God , the entree ! " Sammie exclaimed . Leonard nodded . " Pollo arrosto in tegame . " He proceeded to describe the roasted chicken , the garlic , the white wine , and the perfectly sauted pancetta , with the assembly hanging on his every word with poised forks and watering mouths . His rhapsody on the tenderness of the early peas bordered on vegephilia . As he eloquently recounted the succulent morsels , the perfect wine , and the exquisite service , the congregation seemed to lift from their seats in exaltation , their breathing increasingly heavy . " And then , for dessert ... " Sammie said , pausing dramatically . He glanced around the table at the expectant faces that had been brought to the height of excitement . He took a deep breath and pronounced , " Il diplomatico ! " " Il diplomatico ! " the rest exclaimed with ecstasy as they fell back into their chairs , chests heaving , completely spent . " Il diplomatico , " Nathan repeated in a soft whimper , his head lolling to one side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shh ! " The guests began to rouse themselves from their exhaustion , remembering the feast that was before them . They straightened themselves in their chairs and resumed eating . " More wine ? " Brian asked as he rose with the cut-crystal carafe . " Oh , yes ! " Eli replied , pushing his delicate stemmed glass forward with two fingers . As Brian continued around the table , Jonathan cleared his throat and turned to me . " So ... Alex , Peter . You guys like to dine out , I 'm sure . " I glanced at Peter . This was the moment I was dreading . " Uh-huh . " " Well ? " said Sammie . Having already performed , he was apparently anxious for the opportunity to lie back and allow one of the other guests to service him . " Well ... " I said weakly . " I had a really nice club sandwich at Kaplan 's once . " * * * " You know , we have eaten in some nice restaurants from time to time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel of the dark blue Saturn Mother bought to replace the Honda Civic that was blown up by a mad Democrat . Way back when she bought the Civic , she 'd chosen robin's-egg blue because it set off her eyes . This time she 'd chosen a dark blue Saturn because the color would be less conspicuous for surveillance , and nobody would believe they were being followed by a Saturn . That 's how much our lives had changed in the past five years . " I know we 've been nice places , " I said . " But not like those people . I like to have a good time when I go out to eat , not worry about whether or not I 'm soiling the napkins . " Peter laughed . " They were a bit ... much . But you could n't think of anything better than a club sandwich ? " " Did you want me to tell them the truth ? That a normal meal for us is tossing turkey legs over our shoulders while downing tankards of grog ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan and Brian ? We met them at the fund-raiser for Howard Brown , remember ? " " Oh , yeah . Well what the hell did we do to make them like us ? " Peter turned a slightly puzzled flown in my direction . " Those guys really bugged you , did n't they ? " " No " I replied with a sigh . " They just have different interests . Way different . They made me feel like the type of person who wipes his mouth on his sleeve " " Well ... " " I mean , I 'm sure everything they served tonight was a gourmet 's delight , especially from all the ooohing and aaahing over it . But to my little unrefined eyes the appetizers looked like crickets on a shingle , and that asparagus soup looked like something Linda Blair spit up . Maybe I 'm just uncultured , but " I glanced at Peter and felt one of those unexpected pangs of sappiness . " But what ? " " When you and I go out to dinner , I barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing glow of the streetlights . He moved a bit closer and rested his left hand on my right leg , then slid it down to caress my inner thigh . " If you do n't stop that I may lose control , " I said . " I mean of the car . " The internal surge should n't have been a surprise . It 's my normal reaction to having been around people with whom I have nothing in common , a situation that reminds me of how lucky I am to have found Peter . I could n't wait to get home , get naked , and show him how much he still meant to me . After parking in our rickety garage , we went up the walk to the back porch . The diffused glow from the living-room lights through the window in the back door meant that Mother was still up , which was n't surprising , since it was barely ten o'clock . But as much as I love her , I had hoped she 'd already be in bed . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain the blood from certain parts of the body faster than having to stop and chitchat with your mother . " Alex ? Is that you ? " Her lilting British accent floated from the living room as we came in through the back door . Mother moved to America before I was born , and although it 's been over thirty-five years since she 's lived in her native England , she 's been able to maintain her accent through sheer perseverance and strength of character . " Yes , Mother , " I replied , imitating Dagwood Bumstead . " We have company ! " " Oh , shit ! " I whispered to Peter , who smiled and nibbled my ear . " Stop that ! " I said , pushing him away . " I do n't have any books to hold in front of me ! " We went through the swinging door into the living room and Peter slammed into my back when I stopped dead . Mother was seated on the couch , tea service for two was on the oval coffee table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail was swishing back and forth under the table like a furry tongue licking wooden lips . The visitor rose to greet us . It was Agent Lawrence Nelson , our boss from the CIA . Nelson was still as striking as ever , with skin that looked perpetually tanned and straight dark hair kept at a businesslike length . A tiny bit of gray had appeared at his temples , and I liked to think we had a hand in putting it there . Over the past year our connection with Nelson and the CIA had picked up somewhat . Nelson had been pleased enough with our performance on our last couple of official cases that he threw more work our way , although that work still mainly amounted to courier-type assignments that usually required only my participation : things like carrying an important package from one terminal to another at the airport , or meeting some VIP 's plane and making sure he got to his hotel all right . Of course , I was never told what was in the packages , or who the VIPs actually were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten to the point where I did n't mind being a secret carrier pigeon . I could n't expect much more , since we live in Chicago , and most of the espionage here involves local government rather than national . But I always hoped these little assignments would lead to bigger ones , and sometimes they did . I had a feeling this was one of those times , because none of the usual things we were asked to do required Nelson to leave his aerie in D.C. and honor our little hovel . His presence meant something important was in the works . " Did you enjoy your dinner ? " he said with his usual enigmatic elegance . " How did you know we were out to dinner ? " I asked suspiciously . " Your mother told me . " " Oh . " I could feel my face hotting up . Mother gave me her most wicked smile . " It gave me quite a turn for Larry to show up while you were out . The moment I clapped eyes on him , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? But he assured me that this has nothing to do with you . " " Thank you ? " I replied questioningly , not knowing how happy I should be about the way she 'd put that . " What 's going on ? " asked Peter , whose tone always remains rather firm when confronted with Nelson . " I have n't the foggiest , " Mother replied , motioning for all of us to sit . " Larry arrived just before you did . " Nelson resumed his seat and Peter and I pulled up chairs on the opposite side of the coffee table . " We want to enlist your aid in something fairly important , " he said . " And I wanted to wait until you returned before getting into it because it involves all three of you , to some extent , and it is likely to upset the routine of your household . " " Our household ? " said Peter . " A stakeout ! " I exclaimed . " You mean you want to use our house for surveillance ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother said to Nelson . " He 's a hopeless romantic . " Nelson was looking at me with his usual lack of emotion , but the pause indicated that any show of eagerness on my part was suspect . According to CIA protocol , you 're supposed to want to help , but you 're not supposed to look like you want to help . At least , not enthusiastically . " No , it 's not surveillance , " he said , then turned back to Mother . " It 's a bit more intrusive . " " Good heavens ! " she exclaimed . " I do n't like the sound of that ! " " Let me explain . As you probably know , if you pay any attention to the news at all , we 've been keeping a close eye on Iraq " " You could hardly do that from our house , " I said . " Alex , please ! " said Mother . " We 've been making periodic attempts to find their cache of chemical weapons . That is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs that they have them , but never the weapons themselves . On one of their recent inspections , the team was approached by an Iraqi soldier , very much on the quiet , who has offered us help . " He stopped , and after a pause , Mother said , " Yes ? " " He told us that he can pinpoint not only the location where the weapons are usually kept , but the many places to which they 're moved when we make our inspections . And he 's willing to do this in exchange for sanctuary . " " Yes ? " Mother said again , drawing the word out warily . " And we have agreed to this . " " What makes you think he has the information ? " I asked . " We have enough reason to believe that he 's in a position to know what he says he knows . We had to move quickly , because if anybody over there even suspected that he 'd approached us , he 'd be dead . To say nothing of what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to tell us . " " I do n't understand , " said Mother . " Why did he approach you in the first place ? Why does he want to leave Iraq ? " " He has his own reasons . " " And they are ? " " His own . " " Larry " Mother said impatiently , " surely you do n't " " We also believe that his reasons for needing to leave Iraq are valid , " he said , cutting her off . " Valid enough that he would risk betraying his people , who would surely kill him if they found out about it . " " I see " said Mother meaningfully . " I do n't , " Peter said . " All of this is very interesting , but what does it have to do with us ? " Nelson sat back comfortably against the back of the couch . The move was more casual than anything I 'd ever seen him do . It could n't be a good sign . " He 'll need to be debriefed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly . Nelson ignored him . " We 'll need a few days to talk to him , get all the information he can give us , and hopefully check to see if any of it is truealthough I doubt very much that he 'd lie to us and run the risk of being sent back . " " So ? " " And we 'll need a safe house in which to do that . Somewhere that he can stay for a few days while we debrief him . Someplace nobody would suspect . " From the silence that followed this statement I knew Mother and Peter were as stunned as I was . " A safe house ? " I said incredulously . " You mean here ? " " Yes . " " Our ' ouse ' as ' ardly been safe since we got involved with your lot ! " said Mother . There go her aitches , I thought . And so many of them ! This had really thrown her . " I do n't think it 's known to any " Nelson broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd known him , this was the closest I 'd ever seen him come to making a slip . He resumed diplomatically . " It 's not likely to be known to anyone who 'd be interested . " " And who exactly would that be ? " Mother asked . " I have no idea . " " Come on , Larry , " I said , using the familiar of his name . I always get the impression that Mother is the only one who could call him Larry with impunity , but I 've tried to nettle him with it so many times without success that I was beginning to think this was just a little game I played with myself . " I 've always thought of you as honest . Now who would be after this soldier of yours ? " " I really do n't know that anyone would follow him to this country , " he replied . It did n't escape me that what he 'd just said meant nothing . " Why do n't you put him up in a hotel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be as comfortable as possible , and in the friendliest atmosphere possible . Somewhere that he can be looked after . " " You mean watched . " " I mean exactly what I said . Granted , in a hotel it would be more difficult to be sure of him without keeping someone there in his room . Your family would be a much more natural setting . " You could cut through the skepticism permeating the room with a knife . It did n't go unnoticed by Nelson . The silence was broken only by the gentle thumping of Duffy 's tail against my loafer . " I realize the arrangement might seem a bit unusual to you , but we actually use private homes for this kind of thing more often than you 'd think . " " Well , " said Mother , " would n't it be better to use someone who 's had more experience , then ? " Nelson shook his head . " No . In this case your inexperience is an asset . " " Gee , thanks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affair might make him feel like he s being watched , and that s the last thing we want . " " You 're being uncommonly accommodating to him , " said Peter . " It 's in our best interest , and I think it 's best for him . You have to remember how this man has spent his life . Living in Iraq is bad enough , living in the Iraqi army , especially for someone who never wanted to be there , is hell . We do n't want to bring him to this country and make him feel like a prisoner . So yes , we do want an eye kept on him , but as discreetly as possible , and in the friendliest manner possible . I thought you would be the best people for that . " I could feel Mother 's heart melting from across the room . If only we could believe Nelson . I 'd never known him to lie outright , but past experience had shown that he had turned the sin of omission into an art form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " No more than three days . During the day I would be here with another agent doing the debriefing . The evening is the only time you 'd have him alone . " " What happens to him after that ? " I asked . " He goes on to his new life as an American citizen . " Nelson did n't bother giving this any particular inflection , choosing to let the words to carry their own weight . Mother , Peter , and I looked at each other , then rose in unison . " Well , " said Mother , " I think this calls for a family meeting . If you 'll give us a minute , Larry , we 'll repair to the office . " " The office ? " I said . " The kitchen , " she replied with a purposeful nod . Then she added to Nelson , " Excuse us . " She led Peter and me into the kitchen and closed the swinging door , which provided the illusion of privacy . We huddled close together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " said Mother . Peter and I exchanged glances , then I slowly said , " Gee , I do n't know ... " Both of them raised their eyebrows at me . " You do n't ? " said Peter . " Why are you so surprised ? " " Because you 're the one that always wants to rush into this CIA nonsense . " Mother added , " I expected you be jumping for joy at the thought of doing your spy bit again ! " " This is n't exactly a spy bit ! " " If you mean we probably wo n't get shot at for doing it , then most likely you 're right , " Peter said with an impish smile . " What do you mean by that ? " " I 'm beginning to worry about you . You seize every opportunity to put us in danger , but you do n't want to do something relatively safe . " " I did n't say I do n't want to do it . " My tone was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know that I want to have an Iraqi soldier around the house . Is that so wrong ? " " Why would n't you ? " " Why would you ? " I countered . " You never want to get involved in this CIA business . " He put his hands on his hips . " There 's a difference between trying to save someone from a burning building and throwing yourself into a fire . " " That sounds profound , " I snapped . " What 's it supposed to mean ? " " You know exactly what I mean ! You rush into things without thinking . Just because I try to get you to consider the dangers is no reason to accuse me of not wanting to get involved ! " " Boys , boys ! " said Mother . " We 're getting a bit afield . Could we please stick to the matter at hand ? " It was a good thing she 'd interrupted , because Peter and I were on our way to the worst argument we 'd had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untenable position : I knew he was right . In the past I 'd been far too eager to run ahead , and Peter had been the one to remain rational in the face of situations that could most charitably be called bizarre . But I was still angry . I did n't care that my position did n't make sense . Your husband is supposed to support you in your inconsistencies , not point out the facts . " Now , " Mother continued , " Alex , exactly how much do you object to having this soldier here ? " " Well ... what would we do with him ? " " He 's not a piece of furniture , darling . We do n't need to fit him in with the decor . We would just treat him the way we would treat any other guest . " " How many guests have we had who 've spent their lives killing people ? " She looked at me quizzically . " This man was conscriptedor whatever they call it over thereinto his situation . And he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's an awfully big if . " " And if it 's true , " she concluded , " then I think we should help him . " " I agree with you , " said Peter . Then he turned to me and asked quietly , " Alex , are you afraid to have this man in the house ? " I started to protest but could feel the blood rising to my face again . " The only thing I know of these people is what I 've seen on the news . " " And that ca n't exactly be the whole story , " said Mother . " That 's just the thing ! I do n't think we 're getting the whole story from Nelsonas if we ever would . Is it just me , or does it sound like there are people after this guy ? I mean , despite what some people may think " here I shot a pointed glance at my husband " I do know better than to throw myself in front of a firing squad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying very hard not to laugh . I sighed , then laughed myself . " I can see I 'll forever be haunted by my past record . " ( Continues ... )
