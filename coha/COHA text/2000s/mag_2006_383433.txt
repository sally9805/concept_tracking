H I was a little intimidated when I first met him . I had his CDs , and I liked his band , but he was really quiet at first . Someone who 's quiet and covered in tattoos ... I was just sort of uncomfortable around him . He scared me a little bit . C What changed your mind ? H He called me back a couple of days later , and we talked for an hour . We had so much to talk about . We 're really not that different . We have a lot of the same morals .

I do it three or four times a week when I 'm not traveling . C You have so much going on these days . Do you ever think to yourself , I need a break ? H Sometimes . I try not to look at my schedule for the week because I 'll get so overwhelmed . Every day , there are multiple things to be done and 10 things I do n't end up accomplishing .
