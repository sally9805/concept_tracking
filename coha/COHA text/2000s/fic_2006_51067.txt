In Spain I never rode the Talgo . The Talgo was the express train from Barcelona to Paris , but I never went to Barcelona . This was years before the Olympics , and Franco was finally dead . The white gorilla was still around and all the Gaudi , but I never made it there . Partly it was the expense . I rode regular trains everywhere , coaches mostly but once a wagon-lit . I rode from Sevilla to Cdiz , from Cdiz to Huelva , I rode to the Alicante , up to Crdoba , to Jerez . I rode the overnight from Sevilla to Madrid , and beyond . I used my InterRail pass and traveled free . I bought the pass in Lisbon , near the old medieval quarter , since razed by fire . You traveled half-price in the country where you bought the pass , free elsewhere . Portugal was the smallest country , and I wanted to go there , anyway . I wanted to see where Prince Henry the Navigator lived . I 'd been to La Rbida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At La Rbida I wrote a brief poem . I wrote a poem in Lisbon , too , along the battlements fronting the Tagus , and one up in the Alhambra . All had to do with water but in different ways . I sent these poems to Ginny in lieu of postcards . Each day I crossed what was still called the Quadalquivir on my way to the university that was housed in the old tobacco factory , where Carmen once sang , surrounded by a moat . My room was in Triana , the old gypsy section . The Quadalquivir was not the river anymore but a canal built after the real river changed course . This was Sevilla , Andaluca , home of conquistadors , exporters to America of the dropped a , the dropped s , who never fancied the Castillian lisp . Everywhere : conquerors , water , ruins . We were students and ordered our tanques and caas in riverside cafs , our tapas and merluza a la plancha , we smeared our tostadas with olive oil and pink fluorescent lard , ordered chuletas bien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ate fried squid out of newspaper cones and sat with our arms around each other , as men do in Spain . We hitchhiked to the ruins of Itlica , home to Trajan and to Hadrian . Both men in statues astride the weedy double-axle-wide brickways , both missing forearms and genitals . Such is time , the melons fat in the September sun , the late poppies fossilized with dust : a crumbling city lined with cedar like cemeteries back home . In Itlica I wrote another poem , and I wrote one in Mrida , at the amphitheatre , and one in Segovia by the aqueduct and at the Roman mills that crossed the Quadalquivir at Crdoba . These were the poems of ruin . I wrote poems in Algeciras when we missed the last ferry to Ceuta ; again in Ceuta , and also Tetuan , and in the foothills of the Riff , looking back to the city and its million grabbing touts . I wrote about the streets , too , the geraniums of the Barrio Judo , the streets I walked to the gymnasium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made , oranges dragged fermenting in great nets through the salt water up to England , where Ginny waited . The street near Renfe where , after Semana Santa , I bought her the boots whose soft dung-smelling leather she disfigured with my blue ballpoint later on a bench beside the postcard sellers along the Seine , where we 'd decided finally to meet . The street was named O'Donnell for the exiled Irish prince , poisoned by agents of the crown . The street name in blue and white ceramic tile one flight up on the yellow-washed stucco wall . We change , we all change , she said . It is n't death . I wrote at last in Spanish , short rimas , romances , sometimes a lament , and one sonnet that turned on the words , " una vez escrita ya es la ma , " whereby I employed assonance to argue that once a thing was written , it was mine . I wrote , too , how looking from the rooftop downtown near City Hall where I had moved I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry plain toward Itlica . These were the poems of loss . I was on the rooftop hanging laundry , which I washed by hand to save money . Semana Santa , Seville 's pride : a week of penance , of crowds , and the loss of all control . Holy Thursday , the pasos of Jess del Gran Poder , La Macarena , and La Esperanza de Triana emerged to shouts like a soccer crowd 's , and I watched the barefoot penitents dance their giant floats one after another through the narrow portals of the Cathedral . At the base of the Giralda the Guardia Civil sat their quivering horses , their patent leather tricorners traded in for riot helmets . Ready for anything . The walls of the Plaza del Triunfo were still graffitied with the Falangist talon of arrows and the exclamation of their martyr , Juan Antonio : " Presente ! " I saw the palo bearers , I heard the tromp , tromp of faux-Roman soldiery . The wail of a saeta . I could not reach my program in the press of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paso this was . He could not say , but his name was Pedro , and he asked me , several times , whom I was with , where I was from . America , I said , and he said no , that was not possible , I spoke so well , I must be from Barcelona . Barcelona , where he was from . Did I know Barcelona , the white gorilla and the Gaudi ? And I wanted to be complimented-why not ? - though I knew they spoke Catalan there , not the Andalusian I was trying to master . Will you sleep tonight ? he asked . Will you stay up all night ? That is what the entire city did for Holy Thursday . Yes , I said , and he said , Then you must take some churros and hot chocolate with me . All downtown , but especially in the warren of narrow streets across from the Cathedral , churros were being deep fried and cups of thick , bitter chocolate set out in cafs made from storefronts bricked-over fifty-one weeks of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to eat them . I went , though I knew already . He took me by the arm . I said , No , I have to rest first . Come , he said , and rest at my hotel . We 'll have churros and chocolate sent up . His hotel was across the Paseo de Coln from the river . From his balcony you could see over the river to Triana , the lights of the neon signs wriggling in the water . Cruzcampo , cerveza , Cruzcampo . La Esperanza was leaving her Church , but we did not go . I could hear the shout carried across the water on a tremble of breeze . He knelt to untie my shoes . How moist his hair felt on top , thin and soft . We faced each other like acolytes until the tips of our fingers touched . In the morning , he said , You must visit me in Barcelona someday , and I thought of the white gorilla and the Gaudi . In the streets , the cleanup crews were stacking the wooden barricades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the horse dung . There was that dawn smell of rain , and the bitter edge of oranges . But I did not write a poem about this , and I did not go to Barcelona . I did not ride the Talgo up to Paris . I went via Madrid . I have my rail pass still , with all the stamps . I showed this to Ginny , too . I said , see ? Do you see ? But she was already carving deep blue tracks in the soft brown leather of her boots . <p> Author Affiliation
