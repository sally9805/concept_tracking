The jackals swarmed her as she stepped out into the late April afternoon . When Georgie had ducked into the perfume shop on Beverly Boulevard , only three of them had been stalking her , but now there were fifteen-twenty-maybe more-a howling , feral pack loose in L.A. , cameras unsheathed , ready to rip the last bit of flesh from her bones . <p> Their strobes blinded her . She told herself she could handle whatever they threw at her . Had n't she been doing exactly that for the past year ? They began to shout their rude questions-too many questions , too fast , too loud , words running together until nothing made sense . One of them shoved something in her hands-a tabloid-and screamed into her ear . " This just hit the stands , Georgie . What do you have to say ? " <p> Georgie automatically glanced down , and there on the front page of Flash was a sonogram of a baby . Lance and Jade 's baby . The baby that should have been hers . <p> All the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras snapped , and the back of her hand flew to her mouth . After so many months of holding it together , she lost her way , and her eyes flooded with tears . <p> The cameras caught everything-the hand at her mouth , the tears in her eyes . She 'd finally given the jackals what they 'd spent the past year preying to capture-photographs of funny , thirty-one-year-old Georgie York with her life shattered around her . <p> She dropped the tabloid and turned to flee , but they 'd trapped her . She tried to back up , but they were behind her , in front of her , surrounding her with their hot strobes and heartless shouts . Their smell clogged her nostrils-sweat , cigarettes , acrid cologne . Someone stepped on her foot . An elbow caught her in the side . They pressed closer , stealing her air , suffocating her .... <p> Bramwell Shepard watched the nasty scene unfold from the restaurant steps next door . He 'd just emerged from lunch when the commotion broke out , and he paused at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen Georgie York in a couple of years , and then it had only been a glimpse . Now , as he watched the paparazzi attack , the old , bitter feelings returned . <p> His higher position on the steps gave him a vantage point to observe the chaos . Some of the paps held their cameras over their heads ; others shoved their lenses in her face . She 'd been dealing with the press since she was a kid , but nothing could have prepared her for the pandemonium of this past year . Too bad there were no heroes waiting around to rescue her . <p> Bram had spent eight miserable years rescuing Georgie from thorny situations , but his days of playing gallant Skip Scofield to Georgie 's spunky Scooter Brown were long behind him . This time Scooter Brown could save her own ass-or , more likely , wait around for Daddy to do it . <p> The paparazzi had n't spotted him . He was n't on their radar screens these days , not that he would n't have been if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Skip and Scooter had been one of the most successful sitcoms in television history . Eight years on the air , eight years off , but the public had n't forgotten , especially when it came to America 's favorite good girl , Scooter Brown , as played in real life by Georgie York . <p> A better man might have felt sorry for her current predicament , but he 'd only worn the hero badge on-screen . His mouth twisted as he looked down at her . How 's your spunky , can-do attitude working for you these days , Scooter ? <p> Things suddenly took an uglier turn . Two of the paps got into a shoving match , and one of them bumped her hard . She lost her balance and started to fall , and as she fell her head came up , and that 's when she spotted him . Through the madness , the wild jockeying and crazy shoving , through the clamor and chaos , she somehow spotted him standing there barely thirty feet away . Her face registered a jolt of shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both knees hit-but from the sight of him . Their eyes locked , the cameras pressed closer , and the plea for help written on her face made her look like a kid again . He stared at her-not moving-simply taking in those gumdrop-green eyes , still hopeful that one more present might be left for her beneath the Christmas tree . Then her eyes clouded , and he saw the exact moment when she realized he was n't going to help her-that he was the same selfish bastard he 'd always been . <p> What the hell did she expect ? When had she ever been able to count on him for anything ? Her funny girl 's face twisted with contempt , and she turned her attention back to fighting off the cameras . <p> He belatedly realized he was missing a golden opportunity , and he started down the steps , but he 'd waited too long . She 'd already thrown the first punch . It was n't a good punch , but it did the job , and a couple of the paps stepped in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She flung herself inside and , moments later , peeled away from the curb . As she plunged erratically into the Friday-afternoon L.A. traffic , the paparazzi raced to their illegally parked black SUVs and took off after her . <p> If the restaurant 's valet service had n't chosen that moment to deliver his Audi , Bram would probably have dismissed the incident , but as he slid behind the wheel , his curiosity got the best of him . Where did a tabloid princess go to lick her wounds when she had no place left to hide ? <p> The lunch he 'd just sat through had been a bust , and he had nothing better to do with his time , so he decided to fall in behind the paparazzi cavalcade . Although he could n't see her Prius , he could tell by the way the paps wove through the traffic that Georgie was driving erratically . She cut over toward Sunset . He flipped on the radio , flipped it back off , pondered his current situation . His mind began to toy with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
