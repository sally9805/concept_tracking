Chapter One December 20 , 1860 Llanwyllan , Wales The young maidservant clasped her work-worn hands to her black worsted bodice as she watched her mistress prepare to depart . " Oh , Miss Davies , I think you 're taking an awful chance ! I 'd be scared to death to go up there alone ! " " Nonsense , " Gwen said briskly as she adjusted her untrimmed dark brown bonnet . " There 's nothing to be afraid of . I 'm sure the Earl of Cwm Rhyss ca n't be as bad as they say . " " But he is ! Mean and wicked and terrible ! " Molly cried . " Why , he never sees nobody , nor comes out of his castle , not since the accident . And he 's scarred something horrible , they say . " Gwen turned to the anxious young woman and gave her a reassuring smile . " He comes out . He goes riding , or so I 've heard . And he has a housekeeper who comes to the village every Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that living like a hermit . " " But nobody ' cept them ever sees him ! " " It does n't seem so strange to me that a man horribly scarred would hide himself away from those who might stare or ask questions . " " Do n't you remember what he did the last time anybody went up there to ask him to contribute to a charity ? He threatened to shoot them on the spot ! " Gwenhad been trying not to remember the tales that had spread through the valley about that incident three years ago . " I 'm sure that was an exaggeration . " Molly rapidly shook her head . " I was working at the inn then . They said he got his shotgun and told them he 'd use it if they did n't clear off . " " If I see any sign that he 's about to start shooting , I 'll run , " Gwen assured her , only half joking , for in truth , the stories told about the reclusive Earl of Cwm Rhyss were n't encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the window . " It looks like snow , Miss Davies . You do n't want to get caught out in a storm , do you ? " Gwen followed the younger woman 's gaze over the small yard between the gray stone orphanage and the wall surrounding it , a remnant from when it had been a House of Correction . Beyond lay the rough , rocky Welsh mountains . The slate-gray clouds above did not look promising , but she would n't let the threat of a little snow dissuade her . " It 's only four days until Christmas , and if I do n't go to Rhyss Hall today , I might not get another chance before the holiday arrives , " she said , voicing aloud the reason she simply could n't defer her visit . She gave Molly a smile . " I do n't think it 's going to snow for a while yet and , given that I do n't expect to be asked to stay for tea , I should be safely back before the first flakes start to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for Williams-the-Trap ? He can take you there in his pony cart . " Gwendolyn shook her head as she pulled on her woolen gloves , mended at the thumb . " We 've no money for that , and it 's not far . I 've walked plenty of miles up the mountains in my day . If I find myself in difficulty , I 'll take refuge at Denhallows ' farm . It 's on the way . " " Look you , there 's another thing , " Molly declared . " It 's no easy walk up to the hall . He 's never had work done on the road since the river flooded in the spring . " " I 'm sure I 'll manage , " Gwen said firmly . " The earl 's always had a fierce temper , they say , and since he was hurt - " Molly persisted . " I was in the Crimea , " Gwen interrupted , determined to get on her way with no more lamentations and dire warnings from Molly . " If I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage a reclusive nobleman . And if he 's rude ... well , it wo n't be the first time a man 's been rude to me . Nor , I suspect , will it be the last . And if it should start to snow , I 'll be safe and sound in the Denhallows ' kitchen . " With that , Gwen took one final look at herself in her small , cracked mirror to make sure she was neat and presentable , ignored Molly 's dismayed countenance and hurried on her way . Picking her way carefully along the rough , muddy track that would have been a decent road except for the earl 's neglect , Gwen raised her eyes to look at the massive stone wall looming in the distance . It was like something out of a fairy story , and it was easy to believe an evil sorcerer or ogre lived behind it . The wrought-iron gates , adorned with the earl 's coat of arms - a Welsh dragon and a lion rampant - creaked as the wind began to increase . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sky was even darker than before . Hardly a good day to go visiting , even if it was necessary . She looked back the way she had come . The Denhallows ' farm was two miles back down the valley . She could probably get there quickly enough if the weather worsened . And how long would she be at the earl 's ? She did n't think he 'd really draw a gun on her , but she was also sure her visit would be a brief one . Therefore , she decided , as her toes felt progressively more numb and she wrapped her thin gray cloak about herself , she would carry on to the hall , make her request and leave as quickly as possible . By the time she reached the Denhallows ' , the weather would either be improving or getting worse , and she could decide what to do then . Her choice made , she walked as fast as she could to the gate , trying not to stumble over the ruts . She would hardly help her cause if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mud . The way soon leveled out , for the manor house of the earls of Cwm Rhyss had been built on a plateau that overlooked the valley below . She 'd heard that in the days of the Normans , there had been a castle there , although nothing of it remained . Beyond the plateau was a small valley , then the land rose again , more stark and rugged . A few farmers lived higher up on the mountain , but most of the local inhabitants lived below the isolated estate . When Gwen reached the iron gates , she looked through the bars at the drive leading up to the huge house that dated from the days of Elizabeth and the Welsh-descended Tudors . Its front was grim gray stone , with tall windows that were all dark , making it look as if the house were abandoned . A massive portico sheltered the front door . Not the most welcoming aspect , but she had n't come this far to turn away now . And she was desperate . She had only two pounds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or much in the way of a celebratory feast , and her children , who had so little , surely deserved a few Christmas treats . She would n't be able to excuse herself if she let the disquieting aspect of a building or rumors of a harsh temper dissuade her . She looked about for some sort of gatehouse or a way to alert those in the house that they had a visitor . Seeing none , she tried the gate . To her surprise , it opened easily . That was more auspicious , although the gust of wind that caught her cloak seemed colder than before . Perhaps that was only because she was standing still . Walking briskly up the drive , she was soon warmer , if not feeling much more confident of a pleasant reception . A light flared in one of the lower windows . Another hopeful sign . Then a man appeared , silhouetted in the window - a tall man , with broad shoulders . She lifted her hand to wave a greeting , and the man abruptly drew the curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " she muttered under her breath . If that was the earl , this was not a good sign , and she hoped he had n't gone to fetch his gun . On the other hand , as she 'd told Molly , she 'd survived the Crimea , and other things before that , without succumbing to fear . If she had , she would never have become a nurse , and she would have turned back at the first sight of the blood-soaked wharf at Balaclava . The wounded had needed her then , and her orphans needed her now . ( Continues ... )
