" That 's it ? " Kate Cromwell used her antique walking stick , which she had relied upon as a cane since having her foot broken a month earlier , to wedge her way between her sisters . " Surely that 's not the whole piece ? The story of our lives reduced to a few poorly researched , mistake-ridden paragraphs ? I mean , really , most of us were n't even interviewed by that that " <p> " Journalist . " Moxie Weatherby , whose legal name was not now nor had it ever been Maxine , spoke the word the way she might have said cockroach . Then she appeared to reconsider . Cockroaches were n't all that bad , after all , to a person raised in Florida . " Or should I say so-called journalist ? " <p> " Yes , thank you , Moxie . " Kate leaned over the kitchen table where her mother and Billy J had spread the pages of the local paper out for all to see . " This so-called journalist reduced our whole story down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tell you what ' ? " <p> " There are worse things that could be said about people 's lives , Kate . " Despite her wise but decidedly snooty-sounding comment , Jo stretched up on her tanned toes and strained to get a better look . " Though I daresay the man could have found so much more to flesh out the story if he 'd just made a little effort . " <p> " By interviewing you , no doubt ? " Kate meant it as a tease . Only after seeing the fleeting but very real flash of unhappiness in her younger , blonder and more conventionally pretty sister 's face did she realize she 'd hit a nerve . <p> She winced . As a doctor and more recently a patient , she should have had more compassion . As a sister ? She was n't quite so cautious about Jo 's " nobody ever pays enough attention to me " complex . <p> " At least you got your title worked into the mix . I 'm just one of two sisters ' formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-too-pouty way . Everything Jo did , from being one of the most successful up-and-coming Realtors in Atlanta to chucking it all to work for the Lord at Traveler 's Wayside Chapel , was done to perfection . <p> What did Jo have to be put out about ? Kate was the one with the rekindled romance  --  that still had n't quite seemed to spark into full blaze  --  with hometown handyman , Vince Merchant . Not to mention her new start as a partner in the local Urgent Care Clinic . And the fact that she was doing all this with a foot basically smashed to smithereens thanks to their own mother 's careless driving ? <p> Of the pair of them Kate did think her own story was the more interesting , giving her the right to feel more insulted by the lack of recognition . She demonstrated that fact by angling her shoulder in to block her sister 's view . <p> Jo gave Kate a shove , in that " loving " way the sisters had with one another . <p> Kate almost fell splat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kate clomped backward until she got her balance , thumping her cane on the old linoleum floor of the circa 1940s cottage . <p> " Careful . We do n't want a repeat of what happened on the front porch ! " Dodie scolded Kate , who wanted to blurt out " it 's not my fault " but knew they 'd take her to mean the big gaping hole in the front porch was not her fault  --  when clearly , it was . <p> If Kate had heeded the signs Moxie had put on the front porch warning them not to use it , Kate would never have fallen through the rotting wood . But if she had n't fallen through , she would never have drawn the attention of Vince Merchant , who came charging across the street to her rescue . <p> Vince Merchant . <p> Kate sighed . <p> Everyone looked at her . <p> Kate 's cheeks felt as if someone had just opened the valve on a steam radiator right underneath her . She cleared her throat and banged her cane on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saber at me , big sister . The ankle I sprained getting into the cottage on the first day here is completely healed so I can outrun you now . " This time Jo used her slightly more curvy hips to push her way in past her older , more slender sister . <p> " Use your brains , girl , " Kate shot back , recovering her usual feistiness . " Do n't think I 'd let a little deal like multiple fractures , metal pins and detached tendons still awaiting further surgery keep me from relishing my place in the Cromwell family pecking order . " <p> " As what ? " Moxie scoffed . " Chief gherkin ? " <p> " Huh ? " She 'd spent her lifetime running away from her guilt over her youngest sister 's abduction and now that they had found each other she had a hard time reconciling that child to this now-confident young woman . " Did you just call me a  --  " <p> " Pecking order , Moxie , " Jo enunciated each syllable so that her version sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not pickle jar ! " <p> " I ca n't help it if y'all talk funny , " Moxie argued in an accent decidedly less Southern than Jo 's or Kate 's or Dodie 's thick Georgia  --  which everyone agreed sounded a bit like Jaw-jaw to the untrained ear  --  drawl . " I heard her tell you to use your brines and that she would n't let a little dill stop her , then she carried on about relish and my mind just naturally went that way . " <p> " Definitely not kosher , baby sister . " Jo 's green eyes sparkled at the overblown corn pone imitation of their accents . <p> " How was I to know my own sister would go sour on me so fast ? " Moxie lamented with a laugh . <p> Jo stepped back , relinquishing her spot to Kate at last . " Oh , I have news for you , as far as this family is concerned  --  " <p> " As far as this family is concerned  --  " Dodie rustled the paper still open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , not a competition . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " The three sisters exchanged a look so sugary it could have candied a hot garlic dill  --  and left just as odd an aftertaste for Kate . <p> She loved her sisters . <p> What 's more , she wanted to like them <p> Moxie wiggled into the space left by Jo 's retreat . <p> But they sure did make it hard for her ! <p> " Does it say continued on page so-and-so at the bottom ? " Moxie wanted to know . <p> Dodie looked up and down the length of the page , shaking her head . She glanced at the page facing the story . She thumbed through the sparse offering of sections . Then , having not found anything more about her family , she hoisted the paper up and searched the table underneath . Perhaps she thought some of the greasy inked words might have slid from the pages and now lay strewn across the plastic tablecloth . " That 's the whole article . " <p> " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , " Billy J muttered . " Not so 's you 'd know it to read that mess . Turned the Bait Shack Seafood Buffet into the Bait Shack and Seafood Buffet . As if we was selling chum and night crawlers and right alongside crawfish and calamari ! " <p> " You mean you 're not ? " Dodie looked at him with a mix of awe and innocence . <p> Jo caught Kate 's eye , and they both had to stifle a giggle . Even after all the things they had gone through and despite all their differences , it was good to know they still shared the same snarky sense of humor . <p> " What ? " Billy J scowled at the gray-haired woman at his side . <p> Kate opened her mouth to rally to her mother 's defense , which was n't hard to do considering the way Billy J batter-dipped and deep-fried everything but the flatware down at the Bait Shack  --  making it hard to distinguish exactly what was on your plate at any given time . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke first , but whatever it was he wanted Dodie to know got lost in a red-faced bout of smoker 's cough that carried the same intense blustering mood as his words but sounded more like the barking of an asthmatic seal . <p> " I think you have grounds to call for a retraction , Daddy . " Moxie patted her father 's back , pounded it , really , as though that would actually quell his coughing fit as she said , " I 'll see to that . " <p> " What about the rest of it ? " The coughing did begin to subside . " Fry cook ! The man called me a fry cook ! " <p> " I know , Daddy . " The younger sister 's tender but firm ministrations continued . She 'd done this before . A lot . It showed in her resolute technique , in her calm persistence and in the anxious concern in her eyes . <p> " I 'm a restaurateur ! " <p> " I know , Daddy . " More pounding . Less coughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat icon . Makes me sound like a cartoon painted on the sides of boats up and down the Emerald Coast ! " <p> Kate had to hold her tongue to keep from saying she could actually imagine the big-bellied fellow , with his white beard and captain 's hat complete with parrot feather in the band , that way . She was n't unsympathetic . She understood the man had both self-esteem and health situations , but she did n't have much patience with him today . <p> He 'd done this all to himself . He had been the one to take up so much of the editor 's time that no one else had been given a chance . Plus , even though his physician and his daughter had asked him repeatedly , he would not give up his cigarettes . The man behaved a bit like a cartoon character , like an icon that would live forever , and she was tempted to tell him just that . If he would ever give anyone a chance to break in between coughs and comments . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him redo the whole article , " Billy J blustered . <p> Moxie pointed to the byline . " It says he is the new editor , Daddy . " <p> Billy J yanked the front page out of the jumble of pages and frowned at the masthead . " Reinhardt Media Enterprises ? " <p> " It 's a big media conglomerate . " Jo jumped in to explain . " Very powerful . Very influential . Very  --  " <p> " Bad news , " Moxie concluded . " Bad news for our little paper and bad news for our little town . " <p> No one seemed to have an argument for that . How could they , staring at this awful piece of supposed journalism about their remarkable reunion ? Not to mention the amateurish mess of a photo they had run with it . <p> " Forget the article and the editor . I want a retraction of this picture . " Jo flicked her polished nail against the edge of the page , right beside the spot where the left side of her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vivacious , blond thirty-five-year-old , so meticulous about her hair , her outfits , her shoes  --  especially her shoes  --  had been reduced to a blur . Or more precisely , half a blur . <p> " It was the only photo I had of all of us together , " Dodie offered sheepishly . " Guess it did n't translate well into newsprint . To be fair , it 's not the most accurate likeness of any of us . " <p> That was easy for her mother to accept , Kate had to think , because her inaccuracy made her teased-up gray hair helmet look soft and wind-tossed , like an old-time movie starlet 's . Took almost a decade off the woman 's sixty-six years . Besides , with all of them pressed in adoringly around her , Dodie came off slightly less plump and infinitely more substantial than the flustered and flighty Southern Mee-Maw  --  even though she did n't have a single grandchild to call her Mee-Maw or Nana or Grammy-Dodie or whatever cutesy name its little heart desired  --  everyone instantly took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point here , y'all . As photos go , it do n't do none of us justice . " Billy J 's chair groaned beneath his weight as he scooted in to get a closer look . " No one can tell me that I really look like that . Do I ? " <p> Everyone in the room made some kind of noise , but none of them sounded anything at all like an actual answer one way or another . <p> If the old fellow had been the sensitive type , he 'd have been hurt , certainly . But then if he 'd been even a tad more sensitive , he 'd have gathered the truth about his appearance from all the children through the years who had mistaken him for Santa Claus on vacation . <p> He shook his head and scratched behind his ear , making the white-and-black captain 's hat , which he wore so much people did n't know if he was hiding baldness or just had the world 's worst case of hat-hair underneath it , bob up and down . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You look like you always do , Daddy . Just the way you are supposed to look , " Moxie reassured him with a pat on his back . " I just hope people are n't sitting in kitchens and diners all over Santa Sofia this morning saying the same thing about the rest of us . " <p> She had a point . The three sisters , and you had to squint to make sure there were three of them gathered behind the two older folks at the center of the photo , did not fare well . <br> Continues ...
