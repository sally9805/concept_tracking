Preface // In late 1994 I found myself living pretty much on airplanes . I would arrive in Amman , Jordan , in the late afternoon , check into a hotel , take a quick shower , and then spend the night talking to one Iraqi dissident or another about what to do with Saddam Hussein . Often I wouldn ? t crawl into bed until well after midnight , only to get up a few hours later to catch a plane back to Washington and my office at CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia . It made for a long day . I was used to it , though , having spent nearly twenty years working the streets of the Middle East at the same pace . // Occasionally , in this covert version of shuttle diplomacy , I ? d get off the plane in London and just walk around the city so I could catch my breath . I didn ? t follow a particular route , but often without intending it , I ? d end up in the Edgeware Road area , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Easterners . With the veiled women , and the men walking around in flowing robes , it felt like I ? d never left the Middle East , but there was one subtle difference : the Arabic bookstores. // In most parts of the Middle East , bookstores are forbidden from selling radical Islamic tracts that openly advocate violence , but in London ? s Arabic bookstores there were racks of them . One glance at the bold print and you knew what they were about : a deep , uncompromising hatred for the United States . In the worldview of the people who wrote and published these tracts , a jihad , or holy war , between Islam and America wasn ? t just a possibility ; for them the war was a given , and it was already under way . Having spent so much of my life in the Middle East , I knew that such intense , violent hatred represented an aberration of Islam ; but I also knew better than most the human toll that such hatred can take . // Often I would pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print . Rarely did the publisher or the editor ? s name appear on the masthead , and office addresses were never noted . But with few exceptions , they carried a European post-office box , often in Britain or in Germany . It didn ? t take a sophisticated intelligence organization to figure out that Europe , our traditional ally in the war against the bad guys , had become a hothouse of Islamic fundamentalism. // Curious , I asked my CIA colleagues in London if they knew who was putting this stuff out . They had no idea , but there was really no reason why they should have . Since our London office couldn ? t claim a single Arabic speaker , it was unlikely that anyone there was going to wander down Edgeware Road . Even if someone had , he wouldn ? t have been able to read the venomous headlines . What ? s more , the CIA was prohibited by British authorities from recruiting sources , even Islamic fundamentalists , in their country . What was the point , then , in spending time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no better on the continent . By the mid-1990s , the CIA was shriveling up everywhere in Europe . Our offices in Bonn , Paris , and Rome were shadows of what they had been during the cold war with the Soviet Union . They lacked the officers to go after Europe ? s vast Middle Eastern communities , and those they did have too often lacked the inclination , the training , and in some cases the incentive to do so . // Things weren ? t much better in the Middle East . Often there was only one or two CIA officers assigned to a country . Rather than recruit and run sources  --  foreign agents  --  CIA stations in the tinderbox of the world spent most of their time catering to whatever was in fashion in Washington at the time : human rights , economic globalization , the Arab-Israeli conflict . To veterans like me , the CIA seemed to be doing little more than flying the flag . * // A lot of us who spent time on the ground in the Middle East worried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too much hatred out there , and too many means of destruction to keep the bubble of American innocence from bursting . But I don ? t think anyone saw with any precision the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon coming . Even by the standards of the terrorists involved , the scale of the assault was almost unimaginable . The point , though , is that we didn ? t even try to find out what was headed our way . // Like the rest of Washington , the CIA had fallen in love with technology . The theory was that satellites , the Internet , electronic intercepts , even academic publications would tell us all we needed to know about what went on beyond our borders . As for Islamic fundamentalists in particular , the official view had become that our allies in Europe and the Middle East could fill in the missing pieces . Running our own agents  --  our own foreign human sources  --  had become too messy . Agents sometimes misbehaved ; they caused ugly diplomatic incidents . Worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way the world should run . // Not only did the CIA systematically shed many of its agents , it also began to ease out many of their onetime handlers : seasoned officers who had spent their careers overseas in the hellholes of the world . In 1995 the agency handed the title of director of operations  --  the man officially in charge of spying  --  to an analyst who had never served overseas . He was followed by a retiree , and the retiree by an officer who had risen through the ranks largely thanks to his political skills . In practical terms , the CIA had taken itself out of the business of spying . No wonder we didn ? t have a source in Hamburg ? s mosques to tell us Muhammad Atta , the presumed leader of the hijacking teams on September 11 , was recruiting suicide bombers for the biggest attack ever on American soil . * // This book is a memoir of one foot soldier ? s career in the other cold war , the one against terrorist networks that have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union did . It ? s a story about places most Americans will never travel to , about people many Americans would prefer to think we don ? t need to do business with . It is drawn from memory , investigative notes , and diaries . As the reader will soon figure out , there is too much detail , almost none of which has ever appeared outside of government files , for any one person to remember . All my life I ? ve been a consummate note taker . At the same time , not surprisingly , some of the details simply can ? t be told . Every CIA employee is required to sign an agreement that allows the agency to review and censor anything written for publication . I ? ve left the censor ? s blackouts in the text so readers can see how it works . But more than enough detail remains to give the reader an idea just how complicated the problem of terrorism is , and what this life has been like : the highs and lows , the dangerous moments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conference tables of official Washington , often as nasty a snake pit as Lebanon ? s Biqa ? Valley . // I haven ? t edited out the many mistakes I made in the field . The reader should see how painful the learning curve can be in the spy business . Nor have I hidden that I set out to understand how Washington works , with all of its special interests . I allowed myself to get sucked into the fringes of the Clinton campaign-funding scandal . I have nothing to apologize for  --  other than maybe my own stupidity  --  but if my name rings a bell , it ? s likely to be from that time . // I also intend my story to be a metaphor for what has happened to the CIA that I served for nearly a quarter of a century , and for what needs to be done now . September 11 wasn ? t the result of a single mistake but of a series of them . The Germans failed us , as did the British , French , and Saudis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ? t have the intelligence we needed or the means for gathering it . Correcting those mistakes and regaining the upper hand in the long war against terrorism isn ? t going to be easy , but it can be done . The way to start is by putting CIA officers back on the street , by letting them recruit and run sources in the mosques , the casbahs , or anywhere else we can learn what the bad guys ? intentions are before they break into horrible headlines and unbearable film footage. // This memoir , I hope , will show the reader how spying is supposed to work , where the CIA lost its way , and how we can bring it back again . But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well : I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA . And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed , too . In letting the CIA fall into decay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Americans need to know that what happened to the CIA didn ? t happen just by chance . The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness , by petty Beltway wars , by careerism , and much more . At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally , the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead . Americans were making too much money to bother . Life was good . The oceans on either side of us were all the protection we needed . Afloat on this sea of self-absorption , the White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad . Defanged and dispirited , the CIA went along for the ride . And then on September 11 , 2001 , the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see . // Even if no one could have foreseen those attacks , it ? s still inconceivable that so many people had to die in order to wake us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource for greed and convenience and small-minded politics . I ? m incensed , and I think we should all be incensed , that the courageous passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 were the White House ? s first and only line of defense on September 11  --  not the CIA or the FBI or the Immigration and Naturalization Service or any other office or agency that we pay our taxes to support . // The other day a reporter friend told me that one of the highest-ranking CIA officials had said to him , off the record , that when the dust finally clears , Americans will see that September 11 was a triumph for the intelligence community , not a failure . If that ? s going to be the official line of thinking at the agency charged with manning the front lines in the war against the Osama bin Ladens of this world , then I am more than angry : I ? m scared to death of what lies ahead . //                @ @ @ @ @
