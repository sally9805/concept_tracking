Elaine and I had been working in the lab , dismantling the sleep research equipment , when the call came from the Secret Agency . We had n't planned on a big project so soon . Elaine wanted to go up to Union City to see our son , Grant , and his wife , Karla , and the baby . We missed them , and we needed a break . Grant 's the mayor of Union City , and they had just put his name on the water tower over the population , 2,234 , and we wanted to go up there and kiss everybody and take a few photographs . Elaine and I joked about wanting some proof that we were grandparents . We 'd lived a life looking for proof , and now we had a grandchild . We had n't realized how much we wanted to be grandparents ; we had n't even thought about that word . Sometimes there is a real gap between a word and the thing , and we have learned that empirical evidence can narrow that gap . Grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but we needed to see Carlisle , the baby . I had a real interest in holding the baby . A fact , our little fact . <p> But , when the Secret Agency calls , you listen . These people do all their contracts over the phone , and by the time we hung up the receiver , we were definitely hired . They sent a plane that night , and a driver came to our apartment while we were still packing . We did n't know if we would be gone overnight or for a couple of weeks . He stood in the bedroom doorway in his dark suit and skinny tie . <p> " How long will we be gone ; " Elaine asked him , " a day or a couple of weeks ? " <p> " I do n't know " the driver said . " I 'm just the driver . " Elaine is a scrupulous packer ; she can pack like nobody . She 's experienced at packing . She 's gone everywhere and arrived with the right stuff , even Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a ten-day job in a snow-packed place . This new job was in the Midwest . The guy on the phone , the Secret Guy , had said the Midwest . It would require warm clothing and some lighter stuff ; it could get cold in the spring . <p> Elaine and I had n't spoken about it , but we already knew what the job was . It had been in all the papers every day . It was the new monster . The monster was doing a lot of damage , and he was responsible for a great deal of harm . Some of the things the monster had done were difficult to listen to . They were terrible . It had been going on for months , but the Secret Agency was closing in . We 'd seen it like this before . It takes a while for there to be sightings . Then the evidence piles up , and pretty soon , they 're closing in on the monster . <p> It puts us in a tough spot , but that 's why they pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten ways to kill the monster , but only one or two work , and it 's never the same ones . These guys spend all their time working up ways to kill the monster . They 've done it again and again . Usually they try to kill the monster three or four ways before they find the right way to kill him , and then they do that . It 's always a big show , and we 've been in it up close where some of the monster got on us . <p> When we arrived at the airport , the driver went through the secret gate and drove us to the unlighted runway and the Secret Airplane . I was pretty worried about the way I 'd packed because I 'd been warm all day and I thought I put in too many light clothes . Cold rain in the forties would render me ineffective . Sleet would render me ineffective . I 'd also forgotten my gloves . I knew Elaine would have gloves , an extra pair , but we 'd done that before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Secret Plane , the driver said , " What are you going to recommend about the monster ? " <p> Elaine said , " You 're just the driver ; you do n't need to know . " The driver said , " I 'm also the pilot and the Director of the Mission . Climb aboard . I 'm interested to hear your ideas . " He changed hats and led us onto the Secret Plane . <p> The Secret Airplanes are small but nice . They have a fridge with all the stuff we do n't have at home . We do n't keep candy in our fridge . Elaine and I have a policy of never going for the fridge right away , but as we begin our descent , we always enjoy a light snack . The Director of the Mission did n't want a snack . He wanted to know what we were going to recommend about the monster . <p> " You know our recommendation , " Elaine told him . <p> " You make the same recommendation every time , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the facts of this case ? " " We 've studied the dossier , and we 've seen the papers . This is a textbook monster . " <p> " And we need to destroy it before it does more damage or harm . " The Director was firm on this . He spoke into the radio , circled the plane , and landed in a dark place . <p> " We need to study the monster , " Elaine said . How many times had we said this ? We said this every monster . " You ca n't kill it . We need to keep it alive : ' <p> " Tell that to the next farmer who loses his family and all his livestock and outbuildings , " the Director of the Mission said . <p> " We 've met the people who have suffered harm and damage , " I told the Director . We had moved into his command tent now , and we were looking at the big maps taped to the table . Elaine and I had met these people at every monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They hated us because we wanted to save the monster . These were terrible moments for us , sitting in the rocks and rubble of someone 's house , usually smoke rising around us , while the survivor looked at us as if we were the monster . Well , we were n't the monster ! We were trying to save the monster so we could study the monster . Sometimes , the monster was one of a kind , and the Secret Agency only wanted to blow it up or hang it or drown it in acid , trying their various methods until they found the one that worked . <p> " What if it was your family ! " the survivors of the monster attacks shouted at us . " What if it was you or you ! " <p> This is when Elaine would say , " Then we hope somebody else would capture and study the monster . " But this did n't get through , and sometimes the survivors of the monster attacks would come up and act like they were going to strike us or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none have . <p> " Where 's the monster now ? " Elaine said . <p> " Right here , " one of the secret guys said , pointing at the telegrid screen . We looked at the screen and could see the little blip moving through the quadrants . <p> " It 's a big monster , " Elaine said . She looked at me . " It 's as tall as you are . <p> " And fast , " the Director of the Mission said . " But we 've got ways to kill this big , fast monster . " <p> " More than one way , I bet , " Elaine said . <p> " Ten ways , " the Director of the Mission said , holding up all ten fingers . <p> A gust of chilly wind ripped at the command tent , and Elaine looked at me . " Did you bring your khaki jacket ? " she asked . <p> " I 've only got a sweater vest and my old school scarf . " <p> " Oh , Ron , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved to hear it . " You 're going to catch a real cold this time , and flu season is approaching . " <p> " Is summer flu season ? " A chill shot through me because if I was sick , I would n't get to hold the baby . I wanted to hold Carlisle . I had to get to Union City and hold the baby ! <p> Now we could hear the droning of big motors , and the man running the telegrid said , " Here come the big robotdrones . " On the screen we could see the six big robotdrones . <p> " They 'll get the monster , " the Director said . <p> " No they wo n't , " Elaine said . " The Secret Agency has tried robotdrones on every monster for the last thirty years , and the robotdrones have never ever worked against a single monster . " <p> " They might this time , " the Director said . <p> We all put our faces closer to the green telegrid screen . We watched the robotdrones approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the screen . The blip of the monster still roved freely . <p> " Shoot ! " the Director swore . " Where 'd they go ? " <p> " Sir , " the telegrid man said . " One of the robotdrones is coming this way . " <p> We all filed into the bunker under the mission control tent . It was warm down there out of the wind , and Elaine sat by me on one of the sandbags . " This happened before with a robotdrone , " she said . " It chased us and blew up some things . " <p> " Do n't you criticize the robotdrone program , " the Director of the Mission said . " They 'll work it out . " Around the dark room we could see everybody 's eyeballs . The robotdrone roar grew louder and louder , and then the explosion shook the mission control bunker , and loose dirt filtered down on us all . We went up into the tent , which was ripped up mostly . The telegrid machine was in flinders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's early light and dust and smoke and some small fires . <p> " You ca n't kill this monster , " Elaine said to the Director . " We need to study him . ' <p> " Somebody get this person away from me , " he said . " Call me a command vehicle . ' <p> " You know , " she said , " as well as I do that this monster is one of a kind . " <p> " They 're all one of a kind " he said . " We know that . If they were all alike , we could kill them without any trouble . A truckload of men in Army gear arrived and began cleaning up the robotdrone debris . They called orders back and forth . Every few minutes we could hear the other robotdrones exploding in the distance , over here and then way over there . <p> The command vehicle arrived , a big Winnebago painted Army green with ten antennae sticking out of the top . We followed the Director of the Mission aboard and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing on the screen now except the wiggly lines where the robotdrones had crashed and burned various parts of the country . <p> " He 's not moving now , " the Director of the Mission said . <p> " He 's nocturnal , " Elaine said . <p> " We 've seen several nocturnal monsters , " I said . " In our studies . " <p> The Director of the Mission looked at me . <p> " If we could capture him and study him , " Elaine said , " we 'd know a lot more about nocturnal monsters . " <p> I could tell the Director of the Mission did not like to hear the word nocturnal . He had a look on his face that indicated he was going to scream if we said it again . <p> " Let 's drive up to the quadrant where the monster was last marked , " he said . " And see what we see . We 'll lay out the glowing bags of poison ; they sometimes work . " <p> " They 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another way of inflating your budget . We 've never had a monster , even those starved monsters in New Zealand , who fell for the glowing poison bags . " <p> " We 'll deploy the glowing bags of poison if I say so , " the Director of the Mission said . He opened the storage room , where we could see the bags glowing . <p> The driver of the Command Winnebago was a young woman in Army clothes . She was one of the best drivers we 'd ever had and never took any corners too hard . The refrigerators in the Command Winnebagos are n't as interesting as the ones in the Secret Airplanes . They have some bottled water and cold cuts , but no candy and no fresh fruit . I made us all a turkey sandwich with cheddar for the long drive to Quadrant 44 . <p> Quadrant 44 was desolate in a windy , springtime way . The prairie was barren of trees and only marked here and there by humpy bluffs grown with long grass . We stood on one bluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grazed nearby in the rippling waves of grass . We could see a long way , and there was nothing but a couple spires of smoke on the horizon . <p> " He 's out here somewhere : ' <p> " He 's lying in the grass , or he 's found a hole , " Elaine said . <p> " Deploy the glowing bags of poison , " the Director of the Mission said . <p> " We 're here to save the monster and study him , " I said . " We ca n't help you deploy the glowing bags of poison . " <p> " They 're heavy , " the Director of the Mission said . " We need help . " <p> We watched the driver and the Director of the Mission struggle with a glowing bag of poison . <p> Elaine stood with her arms folded . <p> " The bags of poison are not effective , " I told them . " They wo n't kill the monster . We 've never seen a monster fall for the glowing bags of poison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her end of the bag of poison . They could not lift it out of the Command Winnebago , but they were going to keep trying , bumping it along the floor of the vehicle toward the door . The driver was sweating , and the Director of the Mission was huffing and puffing . <p> " Okay , " Elaine said , taking hold of the first bag , " but the Secret Agency is full of big bad baloney . " So , this way we helped them deploy the glowing bags of poison . By the time we 'd finished , we were all thirsty , and we sat drinking bottled water in the Command Winnebago , listening to the wind blow . <p> " What 'd you do before you joined the Secret Agency , Monster Division ? " Elaine asked the Director . <p> " I was in their motor pool . They 've got some stuff in there . It is n't a typical motor pool . " <p> " Do they have that One-Man Radar-Deflecting Hovercraft ? " I asked him . We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't hear it from me , " the Director said . He reached in a small drawer and pulled out a deck of cards . They were shiny black playing cards with the Secret Agency 's insignia in the center . " You want to see some card tricks ? " He shuffled the deck and did some good tricks . The Lost Soldier , the Everlasting Three , No Diamonds , and he ended with Big Jack . " Yeah , I was in motor pool , but I had to move up . I did n't make up the Secret Agency 's monster policy , but I 'm the Director now . " <p> " No family ? " Elaine asked him . <p> " I 've got the monster , " he said . When he said it , he looked like that one actor , a guy I like . <p> It was a breezy afternoon on the old prairie . We 'd been up all night , the three of us . I did n't know if the driver had been up all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnebago out on the empty prairie in the long afternoon . Sleep filled me up like sand in an hourglass , and I put my feet up and went out . <p> The Command Winnebago rocked slightly in the wind . It was n't unpleasant . I dreamed the same old dreams where I was working in the lab . I had something on the burner and something in the sink , and I was missing a vial of something . I was stretched out between the two projects trying to keep them from blowing up . We 've had a few unplanned explosions , but fewer than most small research facilities . When things blow up in Elaine 's lab , we never spend very much time on recrimination and negative energy . We usually clean up and try something else . In my dream , both projects were about to blow , when Elaine came in with her arms full of boxes . I had some trouble in the dream getting her attention , but when I did , she turned off the water and then she turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes she had Chinese food , and we ate in the dream for a long time . <p> I woke at midnight . The wind had stopped . Everyone else was still asleep , and the Director of the Mission was a noisy sleeper , the way worried people often can be . Elaine and I had done a ton of sleep research over the years . Our conclusion was that sleep knits up the raveled sleeve of care . Lack of sleep is a factor in most crime , and the worst place to try to sleep is prison . It 's a terrible cycle that goes on and on . Our article went on and on . I was glad to see the Director of the Mission sleeping , because he was a man who had important decisions to make every minute , and sleep would help with that . <p> It was a clear night out , stars , but I could see something else outside the windows . Something was glowing , and at first I thought it was the bags of poison we had deployed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was , and I quietly woke Elaine . We opened the door on the still prairie , and we walked out to the glowing object . It was one of the cows laid out dead and glowing . We could see the other cattle where they lay glowing in the night . They were beautiful and terrible , the kind of thing you do n't see twice . Elaine called back to the Director of the Mission , who stood in the Command Winnebago doorway , " You 've killed all these cattle with your stupid glowing bags of poison . " <p> The Director of the Mission called out to us , " Get back here right now . The monster is coming this way ! " <p> " You 've poisoned all the cattle ! " Elaine cried out . <p> " Get back here ! " the Director screamed . " He is approaching ! " <p> " He is approaching , " the driver called . <p> We looked around in a complete circle . There was nothing in the quiet world except the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the earth , and it was jostling with stars . The poisoned cows glowed like little scattered campfires . <p> " We should go back , " I said . <p> Elaine was thinking it over . I loved this feature of hers . She was evaluating what to do . <p> " He 's going to think we tried to poison him , " I told her . " Listen , " she said . <p> I 'd been listening . There was nothing , except the Director of the Mission calling and calling , Get back , come back here now , I order you back here , he 's coming , we see him on the screen , come back . <p> " We want to save you ! " Elaine called into the night . She was walking farther away from the Command Winnebago . <p> " Did you hear the monster ? " I asked her . <p> " Something , " she said . <p> Behind us I heard the Director of the Mission cry , " I 've called in the Space Lasers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lasers do n't work ! " Elaine said . I knew she was right with this one . The Space Laser was like handing a baby a flashlight ; the beams went everywhere . We 'd seen the Space Lasers one time in Canada , and they would n't melt snow . <p> " Ten seconds ! " the Director of the Mission called . Nine , eight , seven , six ... <p> The first big laser beam zipped past us like a flashbulb , and then another ran behind us , bright and silent . Pretty soon the whole plain was crisscrossed with great lines of light in a kind of entertainment . The flashes were painful , and I had to squint . From time to time in the display , two or three streams of photons would converge , and we 'd hear the hiss of burning grass . Elaine took my hand , and we sat down in the thick prairie grass . She was rapt , and I knew she wanted to know if we might see the rumored Big DeLuxe Lasers . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next phase in laser work . The shafts of resonant light hummed back and forth . We 'd worked with lasers , and we 'd had our difficulties . Suddenly , in a flash brighter than a force-four magnesium flare , our shadows were printed on the grassy world in a microsecond , and we saw for a true fact the Big DeLuxe Laser , a rod of light thick as a column in the Supreme Court . It beamed down and then split and fizzled . It hit near the Command Winnebago , and we heard glass break as the windshield exploded and smoke poured out . The Director and the driver stumbled out of the door coughing in the roving lasers . In the flashes the two Secret Agency employees looked like they were doing a jerky puppet dance . <p> A moment later the Space Lasers abated , and the world was dark again and silent , though we could n't see anything for four or five minutes while our eyes adjusted . <p> The driver led the Director of the Mission by the elbow over to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning lazily behind us . <p> " Do n't tell me those lasers are n't powerful , " the Director of the Mission said . <p> " We 've killed the cattle , " Elaine told him . " This happens again and again . " <p> The driver stared in horror at the glowing cows . <p> The Director was speaking into his phone . " Get me a Gas-Bearing Hovercraft right now , " he said . " We 're in Quadrant 44 near the little fire . " <p> " We saw him on the screen , " the woman driver said to us . " He 's right here . Did you see him ? " <p> " He 's here somewhere , " Elaine said . " I could tell , but we had no visual . " <p> The driver went to the Director of the Mission and clenched the front of his khaki shirt in both of her hands . " I 'm just a driver , " she said , " and I think I 'm a good driver , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer . What are we doing here ? What do I drive now ? " She pointed over to the flaming Command Winnebago . <p> " What 's your name , soldier ? " the Director of the Mission asked her . The driver let go of the Director of the Mission 's shirt and stepped back into a salute , saying , " Corporal Ashton . " <p> The Director of the Mission returned the salute , and he looked into her face like a man reading important news in a letter . " Corporal Ashton , we 've been through a lot together on this mission , and now your duty is to get us to Union City . " We saw him press a field compass in her palm . <p> " Hey , " I said , " our son is mayor of Union City . They just put his name on the water tower . " <p> " Well , he 's going to have his hands full with this guy , " the Director said . <p> " What do you mean ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union City . This monster is definitely heading toward Union City . He 's on a collision course with Union City . You people , " the Director said . " Now how do you feel about save the monster , study the monster ? " <p> Then we heard a humming sound like an old vacuum in the other room of a house , and we spotted the sleek little One-Man Radar-Deflecting Hovercraft sliding over the prairie coming our way . It was as neat as the rumors had it . The craft came up and hovered before us , humming . The pilot was a young guy who peeled off his gasmask and asked the Director , " Did you have lasers ? Were the lasers out here ? " <p> " Forget the lasers , " the Director said . " Prepare to lay down the Green Gas . " We could see the gas tubes on the back of the hovercraft . <p> " Will do , " the young guy said , handing us each a polygold gasmask . He began circling us with the hovercraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first plumes of the Green Gas drifting over the ground . It made a pretty layer in the pale night . <p> " You wo n't need that gasmask , " Elaine told Corporal Ashton , " the gas is n't going to hurt you . ' The woman had the mask on and looked up from her compass at us . The Director had his mask on . <p> Elaine dropped her gasmask onto the ground , and so did I. She 's taken the lead in some of our best work . Now she took my hand , and we hurried north toward Union City . <p> " Be careful of that Green Gas ! " the Director said , muffled through his gasmask . " Watch out ! " <p> The Green Gas swirled around our legs as we kicked through it . We 'd seen four gases total that the Secret Agency deploys , and they have n't had any discernable effect in years . They 're all caffeine-based , so there 's a little stimulation , but it dissipates . We could hear the prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morning is a blessing everywhere , of course , and I could smell the new day coming for us . The light on the horizon was a pearl crescent prying the edge of the dark firmament . <p> " I did n't know Quadrant 44 was next to Union City , " Elaine said . We stopped , and I could just see her worried face in the small light . " It 's hard . Everything tests you . " <p> " Life 's a real experiment , " I said . It was what we always said when we were stymied . We 'd been stymied plenty by various stymies . <p> Behind us I could hear the Director and Corporal Ashton jogging to catch up . The Director had retrieved our gasmasks and swung them as he ran . He was in charge of every aspect of this mission . <p> I turned to Corporal Ashton . " We 're going to see our grandson for the first time . We 've never even seen him , and finally our work has brought us to this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved my grandpa " Corporal Ashton said . The corporal was full of the green gas , and she asked Elaine , " How do you make love last ? Is the monster part of it ? Do you need a monster ? " <p> This was a discussion Elaine usually took up , but I could see other thoughts on her face . She merely said to the young soldier , <p> " A monster makes falling in love easier , but love can withstand the absence of monsters . " <p> " Do n't worry about the monster , Corporal Ashton , " the Director of the Mission said . " He 's nocturnal . " <p> We came to the railroad trestle and stepped down the gravel bank to the footbridge . We could see the silver water tower on its six tall legs . Then the Director of the Mission said , " After we regroup and get some chow , I 'm going to call in the Magneto Screens . " <p> " Do that , " I told him . We both knew too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would do nothing but wreck everybody 's wristwatch for forty miles . <p> " His name is Grant ? " The Director pointed at the water tower . " Look at those letters . " We could see our son 's name . We 'd all taken a little of the gas and felt stimulated . " They 're ten feet tall . You guys sure did something right to raise a mayor like that . " <p> Elaine had let go of my hand now , and I saw her step in front of the Director of the Mission . She had him by the shoulders as if he were a lectern , and she was face to face with him . " Hello , " she said . " Listen . What else have you guys got , besides the Magnetos ? Can you call in the Vacuum Ray ? Come on , look at that tank . This is Union City . There are two thousand people here . You 're the Secret Agency ; is n't there something you can do ?
