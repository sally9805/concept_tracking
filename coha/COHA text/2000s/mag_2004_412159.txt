// We live in a society that promotes so many powerful lies about marriage , so many misunderstandings , myths and fairy tales that have become so deeply entrenched in our minds that we are rarely able to approach marriage with reasonable expectations . Almost everyone seems to assume-and wants you to believe that if your relationship is not successful , it 's your fault.Your individual psychological problems are the cause and you can and should be able to fix the situation.The truth is the opposite . Much of what ruins marriage is not initially caused by personal emotional problems but by powerful forces outside of us that profoundly alter our interactions with our spouse . Longer life spans , increased standards of living , women 's increased economic independence , belief in the right to personal freedom and happiness and the social acceptability of divorce have all changed the very meaning of marriage and the stability of marital relationships . Today the only cohesive force holding marriages together is the quality of the relationship between the spouses.This was not so just 40 years ago . However , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sociological developments . Denial of the new cultural reality is putting unnecessary pressure on marriage and is undermining the viability of our long-term unions . Following are seven myths that can tear couples apart . These myths are excerpted from all You Need Is Love and Other lies About Marriage , by John W.Jacobs , M.D. , c 2004 . Published by arrangement with HarperCollins . Myth #1 : All you need is love The reality is that marital bliss is a myth . Unconditional love , necessary for babies and small children , doesn't-and shouldn't-exist between marital partners . People who rely on the absolute power of romance to maintain their relationships are usually unprepared for the serious interpersonal problems that eventually emerge in most modern marriages . Modern marriage requires much more than love . It requires a new awareness of the effects of life 's complexities on couplehood and the development of interpersonal skills that were never needed or taught to us by our forebears . If you really want a loving relationship , the best chance you have is to be practical and to explain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you also , clearly and forthrightly , set the limits of your tolerance . The myth of unconditional love also tells us that we can sacrifice our marriage on the altar of work because our spouse will be willing to put up with it . Make your marriage at least as important as your career . Myth #2 : People do n't really change Many people today believe that deep down , people ca n't change all that much or that nothing in a marriage can change unless both partners change . These incorrect and pessimistic beliefs sabotage efforts to improve marriage . The truth is that most people have very little understanding of the psychology of couples and therefore go about trying to change their relationships in unproductive ways.Then they get frustrated by the lack of results and claim that this proves that people never really change . Changing a relationship is almost always possible if you know how to produce change . First , try changing yourself . Recognize that changing-giving more or giving something different to your spouse-does n't make you a fool or a victim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make things better . Myth #3 : We talk all the time-my spouse just does n't know how to listen The reality is that most of us talk ourselves to death , but we actually communicate very poorly.We live in an era that encourages us to be open about our feelings but does n't teach us how to differentiate between helpful and harmful feelings.Very few of us know how to speak or listen effectively . The truth is that brutal honesty often encourages brutality more than honesty . Too often , spouses use their version of the truth to bludgeon their partners into submission . Marital communication is much more than honest speech . Myth #4 : When you get married , you create your own family legacy You may live far from your family of origin , but its grip on you is tighter than ever . When we become husbands , wives and parents , the models we saw and leftover conflicts we experienced within our families of origin emerge from our psyches and take over our intimate relationships . It 's especially shocking to find that your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently than they do . Whenever I work with spouses , I stress how important it is to develop the best possible relationship with their parents . It is often the key to strengthening a marriage . After all , if you can learn to get along with a difficult parent , getting along with your spouse is a breeze . Myth #5 : Egalitarian marriage is easier than traditional marriage In the newer , egalitarian model of marriage , the expectation is that while not every chore will be split 50-50 , family responsibilities should be divided fairly and decision-making power will be shared . Equality is wonderful in theory ; in reality , spouses in trouble often are conflicted over gender-role expectations and responsibilities . More traditional family role models are always competing in our heads with contemporary choices . Confusion over which paradigm to follow , unfulfilled expectations , the mutual feeling of insufficient appreciation and the unresolved resentment this fosters between spouses is killing many marriages . The only way to fully recognize the intensity of this conflict is for you and your spouse to develop more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair distribution of roles and responsibilities . Get ready for a long discussion . The goal here is not unyielding similarity but fairness . Myth #6 : Children solidify a marriage Let 's speak the unspeakable : Children are an enormous threat to your marriage . It 's very , very difficult to admit that the children you love so much can drive a wedge into your life as a couple , especially if one of the reasons you got married in the first place was to have a family . However , the reality is that in a world where married partners already work too hard and do n't spend enough time with each other , the addition of children usually eats up the remaining physical and emotional energy partners have for each other . Let 's just say it : If you want to preserve your marriage , your children can not always come first . As counterintuitive as it may sound , your marriage , your spouse , must come first , not only for your sake but also so that your children have the best chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The sexual revolution has made great sex easier than ever Thanks to the media , your life is saturated with images of beautiful people having great sex all the time . So why are n't you having more fun in your own bed ? It 's because when stress or marital conflict interferes with emotional or sexual intimacy , the lure of these images makes it very hard to stick together and do the difficult work required to resolve our sexual frustrations and dissatisfactions . The two of you are never really alone in bed anymore ; those ubiquitous images of everyone else having great sex make you feel that you or your partner can never measure up , that there 's someone else out there who 's more attractive to you or will be more attracted by you and that you are missing out because everyone else is having more fun than you are .
