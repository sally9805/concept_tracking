J. R. Dunn is best known for his hard-edged science fiction novels , This Side of Judgment , Days of Cain , and Full Tide of Night . His occasional short stories also tend to look at life today and tomorrow without flinching , as is true of this tough tale of a future that might be closer than we Like to think . <p> Wednesday , May 17 " ... estimates of up to a billion dead ... aid teams in Bombay report that deaths now exceed ten thousand per day ... ln Washington , officials ref use to comment on rumors that the Plague is of artificial origin . Several prominent gentechs , however . have told CNS that certain aspects of the disease , particularly its tendency to strike majority victims , seems to imply .... " CAREFULLY PUSHING ASIDE a crocus stalk , Barb yanked out a clump of weeds . She tossed them onto the flagstone walk and settled back on her heels . It was a warm day , the sun blazing from a dappled sky . Greenhouse weather , they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another plane . Not a jet this time - one of those helicopter things . An . Osprey . She wiped her forehead and got back to work . The garden was in pitiful shape . She 'd been neglecting it since the news turned so hideous . It needed a lot of attention ; she planted nothing gengineered or artificial . It was a utopia for pests and weeds . She ought to concentrate on the truck garden . Ian had told her supplies were running low in town . Stores closed , the streets nearly empty . He was there now , seeing what he could scrape up . A ringing came from the house . Barb gritted her teeth . Somebody had overridden her message . She 'd made it clear : no calls , no news . She needed space for a while . All the same , she got up and rushed to the house . It might be Howard .... But it was only Myra . " Did you hear ? " she brayed , going on to quote something from the news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She might have guessed . Myra had always been the problem child of the group . Look at her now : eyes red , short hair a mess , cigarette in one hand . Barb focused on the burning coal . She 'd thought Myra had kicked that habit . How you could call yourself a Green and still smoke Barb did n't know . A word caught her attention . " What ? Biotech ? " " So you were n't watching . " Myra 's eyes narrowed as she bent closer to the screen . " They 're claiming it 's artificial . That the plague is gengineered . As if they do n't know what 's really going on . " A chill gripped Barb and she looked away , seeing again the children in India , faces bloated and black , the refugee camps on the Mexican border , the piles of corpses everywhere . She forced her eyes back to the screen . " What did ... ? " But Myra was off and running . " Who they trying to kid ? We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance is being restored . Simple as that . The biosphere strikes back and what do they do ? Kick off a witchhunt . It 's disgusting . " She lit another cigarette from the first . " They 're up to something , Barb . We should have a meeting . " " Let 's hold off on that , " Barb said quickly . She did n't want to face the group on her own . The last meeting 's tone had been very ugly  --  Beth and Roger virtually gloating , as if the important thing about the dieoff was their predictions coming true . Barb did n't like that . A cleansing might be necessary , but it was nothing to celebrate . Those were people dying out there , not " debased protoplasm . " In Howard 's absence the group 's moral compass was swinging wildly . The group was the National Environmental Coordinating Committee , a coalition of a dozen small environmental outfits founded by Howard Davies ten years ago after he realized that the national organizations had become bloated , ineffectual bureaucracies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose , informal , and adaptable - " amateurs of the Earth , " as their mission statement said . The committee spanned the gamut of the moderate environmental movement : feminist , Christian , Wise Use , everything but off-the-wall radicals like the Khmer Vert and Red Harvest . The point was to persuade CEOs and politicians , not assassinate them . They were a diverse and wild lot all the same . Myra was a professor of feminist ecology at UCLA . She had her own little gang of students down there , and the committee gave her a lot more clout than she 'd have otherwise . Then there was Gaia-worshipping Beth , and Brad the priest , and Ray the Fullerite .... But Howard above all . Their center , their shaman , their pope ; the Earth 's Tribune , as Padre Brad put it . He could have been another Broward , another Commoner , even another Nader , but he 'd turned his back on all that . Howard valued results . He had no desire to become one more media prince . Barb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have laughed to hear it . " Barb .... " Myra bent close to the screen . " Barb , you listening ? We 're an action committee , right ? We 've got to formulate a response . " A response ? Barb stole a glance at the bolo set across the room . A halfbillion dead - and that was yesterday morning , the last time she 'd been able to endure watching . How do you respond to such a thing ? She turned back to Myra . As if under compulsion , she opened her mouth to ask exactly that . She was saved by a rumble from overhead . She raised her eyes and sighed . As the roar faded she saw Myra bent as if trying to peer through Barb 's ceiling . " What 's that noise ? " " They 've opened an old airfield off the Sound to send supplies to Asia . They fly over all day . Jumbo jets . " " Wo n't do any good . " At least it 's something , Barb thought . But again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vast it seemed the Earth would reject them . No , it would n't do any good . " Same here , " Myra said . " Helicopters . Those big green army ones . " Her voice grew quiet . " There was shooting last night . And smoke over L.A. Looked like it was coming from Compton . I 'm ... taking the kids into town tomorrow . To where the army is. just to witness , you know ? " " Be careful . " Myra nodded . " Sure . But if we do n't act , who will ? " Smiling a goodbye , Barbara regarded the blank screen , thinking again of shutting off the phone until this was all over . But the group might need her , and Howard was due back from Reykjavik any time .... She hit the macro key and waited , chewing her thumbnail . He still was n't home . His broad face smiled at her , glasses gleaming . " ... leave a message . " He winked . " Green thoughts . " Barb hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and paced the room . It was wide and spacious , its big windows opening out to the trees . The walls were closely fitted logs . They 'd had problems with insects hatching out of the raw wood at first but it was worth it . Everything was natural , every item green : a solar stone reservoir system for heating , panels on the roof .... And a boiler , and a powerline hookup . Northwest Washington was n't prime territory for solar energy . She sighed . Was it possible to live both purely and well at the same time ? She wondered if she 'd ever know for sure . But she loved it here all the same . The quiet , the forest , the wildlife . A hoot owl lived in the woods , just yards away . She shivered when she heard it at night . Her gaze fell on the holo projector . She bit her lip . The news fascinated as much as it horrified , and she ought to pay attention to what was happening . To witness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the projector to switch on . She kept her eyes averted until she was sure it was n't showing something horrible . A voice spoke , serious and slow . Two figures floated in the center of the room , one-third life-size , masking the furniture beyond them . A man in uniform , talking to a reporter . The dateline read St. Louis . " ... well sir , we 're not here to shoot anybody . We 're here to keep order and that 's it . " The reporter asked another question , his voice drowned out by some kind of tank behind him . " Genocide ? Look ; I do n't wan na hear that . Those medics are going in to assist ... " Barb stepped past the holo , arm high as if to avoid striking the dwarfed images . She paused at the window . Rain had come , the damp Northwestern spring reasserting its hold . Another jet roared by , hidden in the overcast . She raised a hand as if to pull it from the sky , gripping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , deep and soothing . A whine announced Ian 's return in the runabout . A moment later she heard him cough . His TB had gotten worse since all this had started . She shut off the set and went to meet him . Thursday , May 18 " ... rioters destroyed the UNESCO camp at Khartoum today . No word on relief workers ... Mexico City is still burning . The US embassy reports complete breakdown ... the Senate Biotech Committee has demanded that the Administration comment on reports that the plague is a manmade .... " THE CHILDREN were dark , and very thin except for rounded bellies and grotesque swellings at the throat . The cheerful colors of their rags were blotted and smudged . They staggered toward the camera on bird legs , obscure shadows behind them . The boy fell , eyes open wide . Turning to him , the girl pulled at his arm , nearly dropping to her knees at the effort . She let it go and faced the camera once more , stumbling on with her head raised to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging herself . She recalled other footage , from Ethiopia , Somalia , Bangladesh . This was different . Back then there had been hope , some small chance of lessening the misery . But now ... Images like that had set her on her path years ago , and images like that were her tools , her stock in trade as a filmmaker specializing in environmental fictomentaries . A successful one , too : critics considered her films equal to Koyaanisquatsi and Baraka , and they were regularly scheduled on the public stations , not to mention selling well on video . Along with Howard , Barb was considered one of the people most responsible for keeping environmentalism in the media spotlight after the population explosion fizzled and it was discovered - or claimed , at any rate - that global warming had curtailed a new ice age during the past century . She 'd released four hour-plus features and the same number of shorts-her Gaia pieces , displaying nature in its perfection , as if man 's ravages had never taken place . She 'd been nominated for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted . It did n't matter . The name Barbara Holdon-Nordhoff meant something that establishment prizes could n't add or take away from . Her mail told her as much . A day did n't go by without a dozen postings from people touched by her work . The more mystical types even meditated to them . Still , she often felt guilty about not being on the front lines , even though Howard said that she was worth ten environmental action committees by herself . He particularly liked Et in Arcadia Ego , a film she felt ambiguous about , almost regretted making , in fact . A short , ten-minute takeoff on nature shows : Barb walking though a rain forest , dressed in a white robe like Mother Gaia herself , hair long and flowing , pointing out and explaining various species . Then a crackling sound , barely audible , and screams from the wildlife . And smoke , and flame , a wall of fire tearing through the foliage , touching Barb herself , her hair blazing torchlike , skin melting off her bones until nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally walking through ashes with a hand raised to the camera . It was meant for bolo format , flame filling the room , Death Herself welcoming the viewer to Hell . A lot of people said it was her best , but Barb no longer cared for it . She 'd made it in a frenzy of anger after hearing the greenhouse warming report , in only three days . Anger did n't solve anything . She frowned , hearing Ian cough in the other room . It occurred to her that he might run out of his pills if things got any worse . Of course , it was his own fault , hopping into the sack with that Carioca bitch at the Rio film festival . Taking advantage of Barb 's packed schedule for a little oval office action . Striking back , if truth be known , for the way her career had taken off . It was Ian Nordhoff who had the NYU film degree , after all , not little Barb , fooling with her vid programs on the sun porch . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty - at least that was what he called it . She heard footsteps and stiffened as Ian entered the room . Walking over ; he enfolded her in his arms . She winced despite herself . He released her and left , every movement harsh with reproach . She squeezed her eyes shut . They 'd barely touched since Rio . Sleeping apart until he got better , they told each other . It was a new strain , they did n't know how long it would be .... Not that sex had been any good before that . Since the child , the procedure .... You 'd think he 'd gone through it , the way he went on . Gathering the hem of her robe - she 'd lacked the energy to dress this morning - she started to get up . Then Ian made a retching noise . Her stomach knotted and she plopped back into the seat , overcome with anger and disgust . What was the matter with her ? She 'd forgiven him , had n't she ? They were adults . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably dead by now . Not that she 'd been the first , not by any means .... She wished Howard was back . She needed his strength , his steadiness , his cool , deep mind . He 'd make sense of this honor . She would n't be so afraid . The conference - a meeting of international environmental ministers-had ended last week , but with all the chaos she was n't surprised he was still in Iceland . She 'd noticed a lot of the planes flying into the airfield were civilian passenger models . Requisitioned for the emergency , she supposed . Howard might be stranded up there . She decided not to dwell on that . Wiping her eyes with the hem of the robe , she got up . Without thinking she turned on the bolo . A pile of bodies lay sprawled before her , hundreds of dark bodies and faces . Mute with shock , she thought of the child staggering toward the camera . A hose sprayed across the pile . She watched without comprehension as the stream shut off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream , she swung away as the mound burst into flame . In the other room Ian cleared his throat . Saturday , May 20 " The story so far : in Late March Nigerian police apprehended an American carrying vials of what appeared to be water . He was released after no drugs were found . Last week Dr. Milton Otobe of the government health service conducted further tests , discovering dead plague bacilli . U.S. Delta Force troops , fighting their way into Lagos , have recovered the vials along with a report by the late Dr. Otobe . In a few minutes the President is scheduled to address a joint session of congress .... " " They 've arrested Howard . " Myra stared unblinking from the screen , her voice so harsh that Barb needed a moment to grasp what she 'd said . When she did she nearly dropped the armload of mason jars she 'd been cleaning when the phone rang . Controlling them took all her attention . The best answer she could come up with was , " What ? " Myra nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped off the plane . We 've got a CIA center on campus and one of my kids does dataentry for them . I got suspicious when Z heard that story this morning and talked her into accessing . He 's being held in Washington . " Barb did n't need to ask what story that was . She 'd seen it herself . They had evidence now . The plague was artificial . Somebody had created it , and cultivated it , and harvested it , before traveling the Earth to scatter it wide . Johnny Deathseed . She found her voice at last . " For what ? They ca n't just grab somebody ...... " Oh , Barb , grow up . " Myra 's eyes narrowed . " They can do anything they want . It 's the crackdown . Things are going splat and they need scapegoats . " Myra winced at a popping in the background . Barb realized it must be gunfire . " You 've got to do something , Barb . " " Me ? " The jars clanked loudly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you . You 've got a name , Missy . We do n't . You 're somebody . People will talk to you . " She reached for her keyboard . " There . Numbers for the FBI , Justice , Senator Forbes .. call them and get back to me . " She must have seen something in Barb 's face . " What 's the matter ? Afraid ? Listen , sweetie , we 've been in the trenches while you were making pretty pictures . I 've been busted more than my share . We all have . You owe us this . " She dropped her eyes . " I 'm sorry , Barb . I did n't mean that . It 's just ... " Her voice thickened . " I 'm really upset . Things are getting scary . " Barb touched the screen . " Myra , do n't . It 's all right . Get centered , huh ? I 'll make the calls . I was a little shocked , that 's all . " After Myra rang off Barb sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a half-dozen tries to get through to FBI headquarters . She was finally answered by a harassed-looking girl with a shock of hair hanging over her face . She listened for a moment then broke in . " I 'll take your number and have a ... " " You do n't understand , " Barb said calmly . " I need to speak to someone in charge now . " " Ma'am , I just answer the phone . Nobody 's available .... " " There has to be somebody . Now put me on hold .... " " What cave you been living in , sister ? " The girl glared at her . " Do n't you watch the news ? I 'm telling you , they 're all out . " " Fine , " Barb said . " Here 's the number . But I 'm registering a complaint when they call back . " The girl 's face screwed up in an expression Barb thought was rage until she spoke . " You go right ahead . My husband died last week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen . " You know where the staff is ? They 're out hunting down those biotechs . I hope they shoot every fucking one . " Barb gazed at the dark screen before trying the next number . She did no better with that one , or the one after it . A lot of the people who answered were wearing military fatigues . She weighed the idea of a coup , some Pentagon clique taking advantage of the disaster , but dismissed the thought . The soldiers were simply replacing absent workers . Government positions were reserved for majority applicants . Many of them would be sick or dying now . That was the news Myra had n't mentioned . The plague was tailored to infect minority - she bit her lip- majority victims . It made sense . The Third World still had population problems . They were the ones insisting on industrializing , on abusing resources , burning the rain forests , pumping greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere , making the same mistakes as the developed nations despite clear warnings . She 'd heard it often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tried to recall when he 'd started talking that way . Two years ago ? Three ? She tried another number but after that her will faltered and she set the rest aside . Switching on the holo , she sat with her back to it , listening to the voices and sounds , her mind choking with imagery of bodies , of flames . She waited until it grew unbearable before turning to look . A city was ablaze . The dateline said NEWARK-LIVE . She switched channels . The officer she 'd seen interviewed the other day yelled into a headset . His shoulder was bandaged and blood stained his uniform . The National Guard had fired into a mob of refugees marching on El Paso . The President was on his way to Camp David following his speech to Congress . The cabinet and joint chiefs were meeting him there . St. Louis , Detroit , and southside Chicago were blockaded . American embassies burned all across the planet . An airliner had been blown out of the sky above Pakistan . One channel displayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An arm lay foreshortened by the lens , stiff and unmoving . Indistinct shapes flitted beyond it . Barb leaned forward . " Save that , " she whispered . She surfed channels for another hour . There was nothing about Howard . Monday , May 22 " ... the U. N. General Assembly . Modifications to the plague bacillus include a dramatically shortened incubation period and , ironically . a lowered death rate to ensure its spread ... mechanism for infecting nonwhites alone is uncertain . There has been speculation about melanin levels but some scientists believe that a genetic marker ... after the presentation . Ambassador Home was assaulted by several delegates . U.N . security forces intervened .... " Barb was viewing recordings of Howard 's speeches when the monitor buzzed and a line appeared.stating that her passport had been suspended . She blinked at it and moved to switch to phone mode but let her hand drop . It was pointless ; no government offices were answering at all now . She deleted the notice . Howard 's frozen image returned to life . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone who 'd listen . Barb had quite a few on file - she 'd been thinking about a film on Howard 's career . But she was n't concerned with that now . She was looking for particular lines and phrases , words that held a certain freight of meaning .... She sat up . Howard speaking at ... Dufresne , four years ago . Someone had just asked a question . " ... in a real sense , humanity is a tumor on the universe . It behaves exactly as a cancer does , expanding , metastasizing , destroying its host . We , as individuals , are aberrant cells . And we know what surgeons do with tumors .... " She closed her eyes . Howard had smiled as he spoke . Smiled . She wondered what he 'd been thinking at that moment . Where the words had come from , what the intention had been . An offhand phrase , a metaphor not thought through , sheer hyperbole ? And who had asked ; some kid , curious or wanting to make his presence known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specializing in bacterial mod ? He 'd never said anything like that to her . Never . She was sure of that . Or like the others she 'd found : " Life itself is a pathological symptom , " " No more than a hundred million people are necessary on this planet , " " Most so-called human beings are products of junk genes - living walking breathing introns . " " Someone asked another question . " Block and save , " Barb whispered . The monitor queried her . She repeated the words , louder this time . The image froze : Howard , hair uncombed , in his trademark black suit and work shirt . The door banged open . She jerked upright , hand at her throat . Ian stood panting , his face pale . As he leaned against the jamb she thought of how silly he looked in khaki shorts . " The road ... , " he gasped , then started coughing . Barb got up . " What is it ? " " A car . " He ran his fingers through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed on the couch . Barb hovered over him , asking if he was all right . He went into another fit of coughing . She got him a glass of water and one of his pills , glancing out the front window as she came back , seeing nothing unusual . Ian 's hacking subsided but he still could n't get many words out . Just a car , at the end of the drive , people dying . She left him to rest and went to the front door . It was drizzling , soft , misty waves of damp settling rather than falling on the lawn and brush . She could just make out the back of a car through the bushes at the end of the driveway . Hesitantly she stepped off the porch . Halfway down the drive she heard sobbing and beneath it another sound that resolved into slurred mutters . She halted , reluctant to go on , then thought of Ian , so utterly overwhelmed . Well , she 'd wanted a sensitive man , had n't she ? She forced the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear crammed with bags and suitcases , gas cans tied to the roof . No one was in sight , either outside the car or through the windows . She inched forward until the open driver 's door came into view . Someone was bent over the top of the seat , shoulders shaking , head in hands . Beneath him , in the driver 's seat , a man lay cradled behind the wheel , a large black man , the kind that looked so scary on the street at night . His neck was swollen and he held his head as if he was in pain . He was the one talking to himself . A woman lay in the passenger seat . A piece of cloth covered her face . In her arms rested a little girl . The child did not move . Barb made a sound . The man 's eyes went wide and he fumbled for something under his shirttail . A pistol escaped his fingers and clattered to the floor . The young man in back swung to face her , eyes enormous behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , miss , " the older man whispered . He smiled , lips barely parting . She saw black spots against the brown of his face . She lifted her hands , palms outward . The man grunted . " It bad , huh . " Behind him a sob tore from his son 's throat . " Yeah , " the man said . He was fading . His eyelids drooped and he whispered , " Lord , lord .... " Barb could almost feel the effort it cost him to pull himself back . " You do me one favor , " he said . " Take care my boy . He ai n't sick , I promise you . " She bobbed her head , unable to speak . The eyes closed . " Neil , " he said , louder than Barb would have thought possible . " You go with this lady . " " No . " The word was muffled against the back seat . " Neil . You mind me now . Get out this car . " The boy fumbled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he got out and went to his father . The man 's arm lifted once , dropped back . He whispered a moment or two before waving his son away . Hands clenched , Barb approached the door once again . " Can ... can I get you anything ? " " No ... leave me my wife , you please . " His eyes had gone blank , and she was uncertain whether he was truly aware of her anymore . " God bless you , " he mumbled when she started off . Neil sobbed brokenly as they walked to the house . He was about fifteen , dressed in a T-shirt and a pair of army pants . Barb walked behind him , rubbing her face . She 'd never seen grief this deep before and did n't know quite how to respond . Ian had gone off somewhere , probably upstairs to rest . She sat Neil down on the sofa , explaining that she 'd call someone about his family . He spoke for the first time then : " Nobody to call . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquilizer . Barb went upstairs to tell Ian what had happened . He lay in bed , a damp cloth on his forehead . He frowned as if mulling things through , then went downstairs . Barb listened as he spoke to Neil . He got no answer and after a minute came out and gave her a shrug . She was pacing the living room , biting at a knuckle and wondering what to do when the phone rang . As she answered it she saw Neil sitting in the same spot as before , his glasses off , staring into the distance . It was Myra . " We had a meeting this morning , " she said calmly . " I decided not to tell you . " " Myra , I ca n't ... " A finger rose , foreshortened by the screen . " But you should have been there . Only five of us , could n't reach the rest . That was enough . Lori that little bitch - started in about how cold and cruel we are , as if we cooked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about souls . Immortal souls , can you believe it ? " " Myra ... " " ... said he 'd pray for us all . Nobody cares about Howard . " She grabbed a sheaf of papers and shook it at Barb . " They 've picked up a lot of others . I 've got a list .... " " Myra , please ! " Dropping the sheets , Myra stared at Barb . A rumble sounded in the background and she clutched the edge of her desk . " I ca n't talk now , " Barb said . " I 'll have to call back . " Myra 's mouth twisted and she seemed about to go on , but she simply nodded . " Okay . Why not ? " As the screen faded , her eyes remained fixed on Barb 's . Glancing at Neil , Barb saw that he had n't moved . Night was falling . She heated some soup and brought it to Neil . He said nothing when she set it down . Ian did n't feel hungry either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owl hooted . She wondered if the man in the car had died yet . Driving the thought away only made room for worse . She kept seeing that mound of bodies , herself atop it , enveloped in flames , walking across figures that squirmed , and wriggled , and clutched at her white and flawless robe . After a time she realized she was talking to herself , a poem of debased protoplasm , of human cancers . She bit her lip until she tasted blood . Finally she got up and walked to the bright rectangle of the study doorway . The bowl was untouched , and Neil gave no sign that he was aware of her . She got him a blanket and pillow and went to bed . She could n't sleep , and hours later she heard cries from the first floor . At first she closed her ears to them but they did n't taper off so she got up and descended the stairs . The study was dark , and she paused before turning on the light . Neil was wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the light hit him he froze , then jerked upright , regarding her through sleep-fogged eyes . " You did this ! " he shrieked . His arm lifted as if to gesture at something unseen . " You whiteys ! It 's you Puckers ! You killin " us all ! " His mouth was twisted in a rictus of hatred , but she sensed something else too : a kind of pleading , a longing of some sort . And she might have answered it , if she had n't lived for years over the net , if she had n't married a man who presented no challenge to her isolation , if she did n't truly believe that most of her kind were walking tumors . But all those things were true , and so she shut off the light , and turned away , and in the morning he was gone . Wednesday , May 24 " ...

" THE MONITOR was set on workstation . Barb bent close , splicing in digital footage . She called up a shot of a woman hanging head down from a burning apartment building . That one would work . She glanced at the time bar . An hour and a half of film already , and a lot more to fit in . It would have to be cut . But that was how you did it-throw everything in and then chop to the bone . Filmmaking was editing , after all . Behind her the anchor nattered on about how ferret satellites had detected preparations for an Asian nuclear strike . There was no footage . If they had footage it might mean something . Sobbing cut through the voiceover . Barb turned to look . The anchorwoman , Jessica something , had buried her head in her hands . Her partner , Barret , half-rose , then faced the camera . " We 'll take a break now . " The camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fadeout came . Barb studied the logo . " CNS - the Nation 's Central Nervous System . " She turned back to the monitor . She found a good place for the hanging footage and spliced it in . A new voice came from the holo . Looking over , she saw an orbital shot of an area she did n't recognize , a lot of cloud and ocean . Abrupt pinpoints of light appeared near the Earth 's limb . " Save that , " she shouted . She swung away , rubbing her arms . She was exhausted ; she had n't slept since that kid left . She did n't know that she 'd ever sleep again . There were too many people sleeping now . The phone rang and she lunged for the key . The monitor went blank . Barb stared at it in disappointment . She 'd had Howard 's number on perpetual ring for two days now . " Barb , " a voice said . " Barb , it 's Myra . " " There 's no visual . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a booth . My phone 's out . I do n't know why . " Barb blinked at the screen . " Barb , are you there ? " " Yes , I 'm here .

Shouts , and footsteps , and a rising wail that it took her a moment to realize was emerging from her own throat . She broke contact . The screen glared blackly at her . The holo was rerunning the strike footage . She had nearly gotten her shaking under control when she heard a sound from upstairs . She did n't want to see Ian now . He 'd come to her last night , as she lay awake , and climbed in next to her , weeping silently . She 'd remained still , overcome with disgust , unable to banish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . After a while he went away . She could n't face him ; not tonight she could n't . Padding to the door she flung it open and stepped out . The night was quiet , the moon large and full . Off in the woods the owl cried . There was a flash overhead . She looked up : a meteor , nothing more . There were a lot of them this time of year . She breathed deeply . The air was cool and pure . With her eyes on the stars she circled to the front of the house . The gravel of the drive crackled like frost . Stepping onto the grass , she brushed small pieces off her bare feet . She was only half-aware of approaching the road , the car . A snatch of dream returned : the man holding his pistol , stern and unforgiving . " You did this . " But no , Neil had said that . The man was dead now too , was n't he ? A sound from down the drive caught her ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed in the moonlight . She stopped and called out . Another noise , as if someone was moving . She stepped closer . A roaring grew in the distance . She halted again . " Who 's there ? " She sensed movement inside the car . " Neil ... ? " The rumble drowned out her voice . Without thinking she grabbed a handful of gravel and threw it . The stones clattered against a gas can . She took another step . Something low and sleek raced into the brush . The stench hit her the same moment she caught sight of the thing in the seat . Bloated and pulpy , its obscene bulk seeming to quiver in the darkness . Take care my boy , she heard him say , as clearly as the moaning engines . She stumbled backward , arms wide to save her balance . The noise surged as lights swept above the forest . Hands to her ears , she ran back to the house . She could n't tell if she was screaming or not . She awoke in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a moment she thought that had roused her until she heard knocking . The image of the thing in the car rose up . It had moved as she faced it last night , she would swear to that , like the people in the holograms , never dying , rising to suffer again .... The knocking resumed . Whimpering , she got up and went to the hall . Someone stood outside , a small person . Neil .... But the figure swung round and she saw it was a soldier , a woman in helmet and camo gear . They knocked again as she reached for the knob . There was no doorbell ; that was a waste of copper . She opened the door a crack and peered out . An officer faced her , looking to be no more than a teenager . As he touched the brim of his cap the woman stepped beside him . She held a handcomp that she tapped once . " Ma'am , we just stopped by to see things are okay , " the young officer said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . " Well , they are , are n't they ? " Barb jerked her head silently . He eyed her up and down before shooting a glance at his partner , who returned it uneasily and set a hand on her holster . The officer went through a series of ambiguous hand gestures . Barb stared uncomprehendingly then raised her eyes . " Things are fine . " He studied her a moment longer . " Good enough . Lots of nasty stuff happening , believe me . " He took off his cap and scratched his scalp . " Okay . We got an APC up the road about half mile . Just keeping an eye open , no trouble . Any problem , anything you need , give a holler . And here . " He pulled a pamphlet from his web belt . " No heavy fallout expected from ... you know . But if there is , this 'll tell you what to do . " She took the booklet without a word . The soldier replaced his cap . " Afternoon ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . " " Oh yeah . There 's a car down the end of your drive . Do n't know if you noticed . We 'll get somebody to take it away , but , uh , it 'd be best not to go down there , okay ? " Jerking the door wider , Barb looked past his shoulder . She could n't see it from here . " When ? " she said . The man frowned . " Ma'am ? " " You have to take it away now . You have a tank up there . You can push it . Tell your commander to do it now ? Today ! Push it into the woods . I do n't want him around here .... " " Oh , God - she saw them , " the girl muttered . The officer stared at Barb wide-eyed . " Uhh ... scuse me , Ma'am ... " " Do n't call me ma'am . Nobody calls me ma'am . " His partner touched his arm . " Hey , it 's all right , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow it 'll be gone , I promise . Do n't look outside till then , that 's all . " " I want it out of here , " Barb insisted . The girl paused , as if uncertain of what to add . Barb slammed the door shut . She heard the officer mutter something . " I know , Jack , " the girl answered . " But everybody is . " Releasing the doorknob , Barb went back to the study . As she passed the hall table she saw an envelope . She picked it up . Her name , in Ian 's handwriting . She had one foot on the stairs when a fit of coughing started . Her lip curled and she went on down the hall , tossing the envelope into a recycling can . A Trident sub was on the way back from the Indian Ocean . A radio message reported the skipper had shot himself . Mortality estimates had topped a billion . Troops entering Newark for the first time in a week had yet to find one living thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded her eyelessly . She saw her lower lip quiver and made it stop . Loading the program , she got back to work . Friday , May 26 There was no news over the net , only a message on how to access the emergency broadcast channel . Barb did n't mind . She was screening her film , all four hours of it . She 'd started this morning and had run through it twice since then . In her lap lay a legal pad , to note ideas and changes . The pages were blank . She felt much better now . Occasionally she heard sounds from upstairs or outside - Neil or his father , she supposed - but she paid no attention . She was over the hump . Now that the film was done , she 'd encompassed the event , worked through it and put it behind her . Creative blues , that 's all it had been . When Howard called , they 'd talk about it and laugh . When Howard called . Sparks flashed on a blue-white globe , a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , exist in Arcadia . Barb frowned . Effective , yes , but ... she 'd used the same segue a dozen times . Was that too much ? Worse , the one overarching symbol was missing . The man in the car . She needed that . But it was too late now . The army had taken him away . She 'd heard the tank earlier , or sometime yesterday . He would n't be back . Anyway , it might already be in there . She would swear she 'd seen him again just a little while ago , his swollen , eyeless head bobbing , his teeth flashing in an endless grin : " God bless you , ma'am . " She 'd watch it through one more time to make sure . The monitor pinged . She clutched herself . For a second she could n't think of what it could be but then she remembered Howard and leapt from the couch , pad dropping at her feet . She groaned ; the screen was blank . But the callback slug displayed his number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit her thumb . It kept ringing and she 'd almost decided it had been a glitch when the screen lit up . He was half-turned away , hand reaching for the keyboard . " Howard ! " she screamed . The hand became a fist and shook for a moment . Howard looked up at her . " Hello , Barbara . " His glasses were missing , and he had n't shaved . His eyes were sunken and ringed with gray circles , and his hair was messier than usual . She ignored all that . He was back , that was what counted . Howard was back . Everything would fall into place now , rightness and balance and clarity return . " They let you go . " The words were a croak . Howard nodded . " Yes , yes . No punishment for us . " He lowered his eyes as if looking for something under his monitor . " Did they hurt you ? " He shook his head and she went on , telling him about Myra , the black man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mound , the car . She was blinking away tears when she finished . " ... and those liars are saying somebody made this . It was because of us . All of it . They call it the Greening . But that 's not true . " She paused , tasting salt at the corner of her lips . " Is it ? " Howard moved for the first time since she began speaking . " Yes , " he said softly . " Yes , it 's true . " He squinted , as if wondering who she could be . " They caught one of them . Showed me a confession , a tape .... He seemed proud , very proud . " His face lost all expression . " I knew him ... know him . Know them all , in fact . The one they caught was ... well , the name means nothing . He told me all about it , several years ago . Their blueprint , their plan . I can see that now . Theory , I thought at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Why note " " He looked away once more . " Two words . It does n't seem like enough . But ... " His face twisted . " It is . " Barb tried to stifle the sounds in her throat . Howard raised his head , his eyes still focused elsewhere . " I watched your film just now . The rain forest , yourself as Gaia , the flames .... It 's very powerful , still . " He met her eyes at last . " We meant well , Barbara . Do n't forget that . We meant well . " His hand crept to the keyboard . " Goodbye , dear lady . God bless you . " She backed away from the dark screen , her cries echoing off the walls . Brown faces screamed , a globe sparkled , Gaia smiled . She ran into the hall , waving them all away . A voice called from upstairs . She shouted back at it . Go to your whores .... They 'll take care of you .... Leave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps started down the stairs . She raced for the door . In the woods the owl hooted . She stumbled off the porch and stopped to catch her breath . Raising her head , she pulled her hair back . No planes , no lights , a black dead sky . They had given up . Just as well . All a waste anyway . It was ended ; nothing to be done , no way to make it right . She felt a smile growing and raised a hand to her lips , knuckles mashing them against her teeth . She spotted the car . It was still there . After they 'd promised . She marched down the drive . Lying bastards . God , she hated it when they lied . Stand there looking right at you and butter would n't melt and they lie . They lie about everything . Calling it the Greening . Saying it was her fault . Talking introns , every last one of them . The car had to go . It could n't be here when Howard came . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or blow it up , either one . They were good at that . Her gaze caught the gas cans atop the roof . Gas made fire , did n't it ? Fire that was pure . Fire that cleansed . Fire that solved everything . She sped up , on tiptoe , moving quietly so as not to waken the black man . He 'd want to know what had happened to Neil and what could she tell him ? The cap was on tight and she broke a nail but at last it popped free and the gas gurgled across the roof , cutting through that other stink . She had no matches . Another howl was stirring in her throat when she remembered the black man 's gun . He quivered as she felt around the front seat but she screamed , " No ! " and he went still . A knee grazed the hard barrel . She snatched the pistol up from where it had fallen . It was heavy and did n't fire at first but she flipped all the switches until it went off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shouts came from down the road , and behind her someone called her name . She sighted on the cans and fired once , then again . The third time the barrel hit her forehead and she let the gun drop but the gas had caught with a satisfying whump so it did n't matter . A searchlight blinded her as she held her arms wide to the warmth of the flames . A motor roared , gave way to a clanking noise . She screamed at it to stop and turned back to the house . The garden lay in her path . She surveyed it in the clean firelight . She was one to talk . All those weeds - what would Howard say ? She grasped a stalk and ripped it out . Someone came up and coughed as she dropped to her knees to get at the rest . He whispered her name . She ignored him . The clanking grew louder then ceased . Another low whump gave her more light . She kept working . By the time the soldiers reached her the patch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
