<p> AS the aggregate number of American military fatalities in Iraq has crept up over the past 13 months  --  from 1,000 to 1,500 dead , and now to 2,000  --  public support for the war has commensurately declined . With the nightly ghoulish news of improvised explosives and suicide bombers , Americans perhaps do not appreciate that the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq have been accomplished at relatively moderate cost  --  two-thirds of the civilian fatalities incurred four years ago on the first day of the war against terrorism . <p> Comparative historical arguments , too , are not much welcome in making sense of the tragic military deaths  --  any more than citing the tens of thousands Americans who perish in traffic accidents each year . And few care to hear that the penultimate battles of a war are often the costliest  --  like the terrible summer of 1864 that nearly ruined the Army of the Potomac and almost ushered in a Copperhead government eager to stop at any cost the Civil War , without either ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an abject bloodbath that took more than 50,000 American casualties , yet that campaign officially ended less than six weeks before Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender . <p> Compared with Iraq , America lost almost 17 times more dead in Korea , and 29 times more again in Vietnam  --  in neither case defeating our enemies nor establishing democracy in a communist north . <p> Contemporary critics understandably lament our fourth year of war since Sept. 11 in terms of not achieving a victory like World War II in a similar stretch of time . But that is to forget the horrendous nature of such comparison when we remember that America lost 400,000 dead overseas at a time when the country was about half its present size . <p> There is a variety of explanations why the carnage of history seems to bring today 's public little comfort or perspective about the comparatively moderate costs of Iraq . First , Americans , like most democratic people , can endure fatalities if they believe they come in the pursuit of victory , during a war against an aggressor with a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about three-quarters of the American people approved of the invasion upon the fall of the Saddam Hussein statue in Baghdad in April 2003 . <p> The public 's anguish for the fewer than 150 lost during that campaign was counterbalanced by the apparently easy victory and the visible signs of enemy capitulation . But between the first 200 fatalities and the 2,000th , a third of those favoring the war changed their minds , now writing off Iraq as a mistake . Perhaps we could summarize this radical transformation as , " I was for my easy removal of Saddam , but not for your bungled and costly postwar reconstruction . " <p> Part of the explanation is that , like all wars against amorphous insurgencies , the current struggle requires almost constant explanation by the government to show how and why troops are fighting in a necessary cause  --  and for the nation 's long-term security interests . Unless official spokesmen can continually connect the terrible sacrifices of our youth with the need to establish a consensual government in Iraq that might help to end the old pathology of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists , then the TV screen 's images of blown-up American troops become the dominant narrative . The Bush administration , of course , did not help itself by having put forth weapons of mass destruction as the primary reason for the invasion  --  when the Senate , in bipartisan fashion , had previously authorized the war on a score of other sensible writs . <p> Yet castigating a sitting president for incurring such losses in even a victorious or worthy cause is hardly new . World War I and its aftermath destroyed Woodrow Wilson . Franklin Roosevelt 's closest election was his fourth , just as the war was turning for the better in 1944 ( a far better fate , remember , than his coalition partner Winston Churchill , who was thrown out of office before the final victory that he had done so much to ensure ) . Harry Truman wisely did not seek re-election in 1952 in the mess of Korea . Vietnam destroyed Lyndon Johnson and crippled Richard Nixon . Even George H.W. Bush found no lasting thanks for his miraculous victory in the 1991 Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression  --  a victory obtained without the loss of a single American life  --  gave him no stored political capital when impeachment neared . <p> Americans are not afraid of wars , and usually win them , but our nature is not militaristic . Generals may become heroes despite the loss of life , but the presidents rarely find much appreciation even in victory . <p> Television and the global news media have changed the perception of combat fatalities as well . CNN would have shown a very different Iwo Jima  --  bodies rotting on the beach , and probably no coverage of the flag-raising from Mount Suribachi . It is conventional wisdom now to praise the amazing accomplishment of June 6 , 1944 . But a few ex tempore editorial comments from Geraldo Rivera or Ted Koppel , reporting live from the bloody hedgerows where the Allied advance stalled not far from the D-Day beaches  --  a situation rife with intelligence failures , poor equipment and complete surprise at German tactics  --  might have forced a public outcry to withdraw the forces from the Normandy " debacle " before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gens . Omar Bradley , Dwight Eisenhower or George Marshall himself  --  would have been fired as responsible for sending hundred of poorly protected armored vehicles down the narrow wooded lanes of the Bocage to be torched by well-concealed Germans . Subsequent press conferences over underarmored Sherman tanks would have made the present furor over Humvees in Iraq seem minor . <p> We are also now a different , much more demanding people . Americans have become mostly suburban , at great distance from the bloodletting and routine mayhem on the farms of our ancestors . We feel cheated if we do n't die at 85 in quiet sleep rather than , as in the past , at 50 right on the job . Popular culture demands that we look 40 when we are 60 , and with a pill we can transform fatal diseases into the status of mere runny noses . ( Admittedly , this same degree of medical technology has kept the death total in Iraq a far smaller percentage of overall casualties than it would have been in any earlier war . ) <p> Our technology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly impossible seem boringly routine . Ejecting a half-million or so Iraqis from Kuwait halfway around the world in 1991 , or stopping Slobodan Milosevic from killing civilians is not just conceivable , but can and should be done almost instantly with few or no American lives lost . With such expectations of perfection , any death becomes a near national catastrophe for nearly 300 million in a way the disasters at the battles of Antietam and Tarawa were for earlier , fewer and poorer Americans . <p> If our enemies similarly believed in the obsolescence of war that so heartlessly has taken 2,000 of our best young men and women , then we could find solace in our growing intolerance of any battlefield losses . But until the nature of man himself changes , there will be wars that take our youth , and we will be increasingly vexed to explain why we should let them . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
