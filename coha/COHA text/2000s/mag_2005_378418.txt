Amy Grant 's new reality show is so sweet that you may need to brush and floss after watching it . In the pilot for Three Wishes , making its debut this fall on NBC , the Christian-pop singer and a crew visit a small California town to do three life-changing deeds . They arrange an operation for a girl whose skull was shattered in a car accident . They help a boy get adopted . And they build a new football field in honor of a high school coach with leukemia . Grant dispenses hugs by the bushel , sheds tears and pulls out her guitar , twice , to sing her single , Takes a Little Time : " It takes a little time sometimes/ To get your feet back on the ground . " <P> In another verse , which she does n't sing on camera , the lyrics continue : " You ca n't fix this pain with money . " Do n't be so sure . Alongside Three Wishes , several shows new and old are opening their wallets-and those of their corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" People ask us how they can help , " says executive producer Tom Forman . " It reminds us what good people we really are . " <P> TV crews are lining up around the block to offer a good deed and a good cry .

On this summer 's inspirationally themed Brat Camp , troubled kids have their lives turned around by counseling . And for viewers who like to see heartstrings tugged literally as well as metaphorically , next season The Miracle Workers will give away medical care . A man gets treatment for severe tics so he can hold his baby again ; a boy gets cochlear implants to hear his mother for the first time . Says executive producer Justin Falvey : " There are thousands of people suffering enormously and unnecessarily out there . " <P> The networks call this phenomenon a reaction against mean reality shows and in favor of ones on which good things happen to nice people ( see also American Idol ) . " We started off in a cynical place , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens when animals attack and human beings are treated like lab rats in a social experiment . But people seeing wishes and dreams come true will always resonate .
