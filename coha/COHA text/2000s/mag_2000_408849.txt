WILL HUMANS SURVIVE TO THE NEXT MILLENNIUM ? DOES LIFE EXIST BEYOND EARTH ? CAN WE STOP AGING ? WILL WE CLONE A HUMAN ? WILL WE CONTROL THE WEATHER ? HOW DID THE UNIVERSE BEGIN AND HOW WILL IT END ? // IN RECENT YEARS , researchers have made a multitude of important discoveries about the scale and structure of the universe , the internal workings of the atom , and the evolution of life on Earth . In fact , science has advanced more in the past few decades than in all the preceding years of history . But that pace pales in comparison to what lies ahead . Today , there are more scientists than ever , and they are publishing research papers and patenting new technologies at a phenomenal rate . Meanwhile , among the U.S. public , scientific curiosity is growing . According to " Science and Engineering Indicators 1998 , " a biennial survey of 2,000 adults commissioned by the National Science Foundation , 70 percent of Americans say they are interested in science and technology . " Overall , the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the quality of life , " the report says , " and the scientific community is accorded a higher level of trust and confidence than other major societal institutions . " In this special section , the editors of POPULAR SCIENCE will give you a look at what is on the scientific agenda for the next millennium-not only the questions that scientists are hoping to answer , but what the public wants to know . We wonder whether , for example , there is any hope for eternal life-for an individual , a species , or even the universe itself . And is there another place in the universe where the conditions are right for life ? To forecast the future of science , we 've chosen six big questions that are on the minds of many people today , scientists and laypeople alike . Some are primarily a matter of intellectual curiosity ; others address our most basic survival instincts . In the end , what makes each of these questions interesting may not be the answers themselves , but how they are revealed to scientists of the future. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or face extinction , argue scientists . There 's no place else to go . BIOSPHERE II was a spectacular failure . The gleaming glass-and-concrete habitat sprawling across the desert in Oracle , Arizona , was supposed to support eight human " biospherians " for two years , but the seal had to be broken before the experiment ended in 1993 . Oxygen had fallen to levels normally seen at an elevation of 17,500 feet . Nitrous oxide had risen to the point where it threatened to cause brain damage . The fresh water supply became contaminated , and vines smothered food plants . Insect pollinators and many other species became extinct . By the end , Biosphere II was overrun with swarms of ants and cockroaches . Scientists who gathered recently to review the Biosphere II experiment reached a disturbing conclusion : " No one yet knows how to engineer systems that provide humans with the life-supporting services that natural ecosystems produce for free . " Photograph Ecologist David Tillman 's studles at Cedar Creek have shown that areas rich in biological diversity are more resistant to problems such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergoing wrenching changes . Water and air quality , while improving in some regions , are deteriorating in many others . Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are climbing . The world 's population could reach 10 billion by 2050 . And famed Harvard biologist Edward 0 . Wilson says the current rate of species losses puts us " in the midst of one of the great extinction spasms of geological history . " All of which makes many ecologists wonder whether humans too will soon become extinct . " It 's an incredibly important but incredibly difficult question , " says David Tilman of the University of Minnesota , one of the scientists who reviewed the Biosphere II experiment . ' If we continue on this course , we 're heading for a world in which agriculture will have immense impacts on the entire globe , " he says . " Humans will consume the vast majority of the surface fresh waters of the world , especially for irrigation . Pesticide use could double in the next 50 years . " Because of these human impacts , Tilman says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to engineer services we 've always received for free from nature . " That 's why the failure of Biosphere II was so disturbing : It proves that we do n't yet know how to do that . Tilman is not an environmental activist ; he is a scientist . His concerns about the future arise from the years he has spent doing experiments at a 9-square-mile study site called Cedar Creek , about 30 miles north of Minneapolis . Three distinct ecosystems meet there : northern , or boreal , forest ; deciduous forest ; and prairie . Tilman has studied how different areas in Cedar Creek respond to drought , changes in nitrogen levels in the soil , and changes in the numbers and kinds of species living in these areas . The experiments have shown that ecosystems with the most species are most resistant to drought , soil degradation , and wild fluctuations in plant growth . Tilman 's research has also shown that high levels of nitrogenthe key component in agricultural fertilizers-can lead to the extermination of certain plant species . aWe are heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he says . If the ecological principles established at Cedar Creek hold true elsewhere , that means we 'll be living in a world with depleted soils , vulnerability to drought , and unpredictable changes in plant growth-which could lead to years of bounty and years of famine . And the services that nature provides will begin to crumble . " The production of clean water and fertile soils , the pollination of crops , the disposal of humanity 's waste productsthese are all things that have been done for us , " says Tilman . As the world loses its biological diversity , these needs will no longer be met . " To get off this course , we have to realize our interdependence with other organisms in this world , " Tilman says . For example , letting cattle graze on grasslands to turn low-quality food ( grass ) into highquality food ( protein ) is more efficient than keeping cattle in pens and feeding them grain , he says . " It takes a lot of land to produce that grain . " But changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have to have major changes in lifestyle , " Tilman says . " We ca n't all live like Westerners . We 're going to have to go in the other direction-living more like Asians . " The Biosphere II experience demonstrated that maintaining human life is a tricky proposition-especially if we can no longer rely on the services provided by natural ecosystems . If we are currently living through a mass extinction , as Wilson believes , we should consider the past . In the great Permian extinction 245 million years ago , 96 percent of species perished . Eventually , the Earth was repopulated with a rich collection of new species-but it took 100 million years . " That should give pause to anyone who believes that what Homo sapiens destroys , nature will redeem , ' Wilson says . " Maybe so , but not within any length of time that has meaning for contemporary humanity .

HUMANS HAVE LONG speculated that we 're not alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when these speculations are at last replaced by fact . // IRRIGATED AREA // GRAIN HARVEST // CARBON DIOXIDE // Mars , long regarded as the most promising place in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life , is to be visited by a flotilla of automated invaders , starting with the Mars Surveyor Lander 2001 , which will sniff the soil to help determine its suitability for life . Other future probes include a soil-return mission , Mars balloons , and long-range rovers capable of exploring the martian surface for years on end . Whether or not unmanned probes find signs of life on Mars , we 're going to want to follow up by sending humans to the Red Planet . If there is evidence of life there , the astronauts ' mission will be to learn more about it . If not , they will want to dig deeper and-if Mars does prove to be sterile-prepare it for human habitation . Another auspicious target in the search for life is the ocean thought to lie beneath the global ice cap covering Jupiter 's moon Europa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Europa must have a molten core and thermal vents that keep the water warm . Here on Earth , such vents are abloom with strange life forms ; some researchers propose that terrestrial life might have originated there , without benefit of sunlight . Photograph Beneath the Icy surface of Jupiter 's moon Europe may lie an ocean containing extraterrestrial life forms . // To see if there is aquatic life on Europa , we could dispatch a lander capable of melting a hole in the icewhich is estimated to be at least 3 kilometers thick-and releasing small submarines into the ocean to seek out thermal vents . NASA 's Europa Orbiter , scheduled for launch in 2003 , is a first step : It will look for tidal bending of the ice crust , which would confirm the presence of an ocean below . Saturn 's mysterious satellite Ti tan-which has a dense , cloudy atmosphere thought to be rich in organic molecules-may replicate conditions on the early Earth when life began . The Cassini spacecraft , due to orbit Saturn in 2004 , will parachute a probe onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Titan orbiter equipped with a brace of small landers . Such missions could shed light on the origins of life in general , even if there is no life on Titan itself . Happy Birthday a Hundredfold ! Unprecedented numbers of babies born this year may live to celebrate New Year 's Day , 2100 . DURING THE PAST 100 years , better sanitation , better nutrition , and modern medicine have bumped up life expectancy to where most people in this country can expect to live 75 years at least . The U.S. Census Bureau is predicting that the number of senior citizens surviving to see 90 will double by 2050 . Once considered the stuff of Hollywood imagination , the very real prospect of large numbers of people living 100-plus years is leading many to ponder , " Will many of us alive today live to see the year 2100 ? " The same question asked a decade ago would have seemed almost comical . Gerontology was geared more toward turning us into a population of Jack LaLanes than a race of Methuselahs . But thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecular biology of how cells age , the field is rapidly gathering momentum . And one scientist carrying a proverbial torch is Michael West , CEO of Worcester , Massachusetts-based Advanced Cell Technology ( ACT ) . West has been studying aging for 20 years , starting up and then leaving behind two biotechnology companies before moving to ACT in 1998-a company whose technology he thinks is poised to launch an assault on aging . " I really believe that the most exciting and unexpected development in medical research in the coming decades is going to be the ability to understand human aging and do something about it , " he says . " West is about as optimistic as you can find , of the people I call responsible scientists , " says Richard Sprott . Formerly associate director of the National Institute on Aging , Sprott is now executive director of the Ellison Medical Foundation , a nonprofit group recently set up by Redwood Shores , California-based Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to pump $20 million annually into aging research . Two dozen nearby stars have already shown evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly as the new millennium unfolds . At present , we lack telescopes capable of seeing those planets , which are small and dim and immersed in the glare of their parent stars . ( If we lived on a planet orbiting the nearest star to the sun , no existing optical telescope could see even giant Jupiter , much less Earth . ) Photograph Michael West , who has studied aging for 20 years , thinks It 's possible to live to 200. // But that will soon change . Highprecision space telescopes , working in unison , will image extrasolar planets and take spectra of their atmospheres , looking for the molecular signatures of life as we know it . Space probes passing Earth on their way to the outer planets have already detected spectral evidence of terrestrial life , proving that this approach can work . Earth 's spectral lines signal the presence of chlorophyll , molecular oxygen ( plants recirculate oxygen , which otherwise would combine with the soil and fade from sight ) , and methane ( which would soon by gobbled up by the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ruminating cattle and bubbling swamp gas ) . If similar spectra are found for another planet , we will be on the verge of the greatest scientific discovery in all history-that there is indeed life beyond Earth . The foundation , in effect , is picking up the ball where West left it : One of the companies West founded , Geron Corp . in Menlo Park , California , pulled off what is one of the most provocative finds in basic aging research to date-the gene that makes the enzyme telomerase . The enzyme is responsible for repairing the ends of chromosomes , or telomeres . Telomeres have long been implicated in cellular aging because they get progressively shorter each time a cell divides , until eventually the cell stops dividing and dies . Last year , scientists at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston bred six successive generations of mice , each born with shorter telomeres than its parents . The third-generation mice developed gray hair , male-pattern baldness , and skin lesions more often than normal mice of the same age . The sixth-generation mice displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , had normal livers and kidneys , and they did not develop thin bones or cataracts . And only the sixthgeneration mice with critically short telomeres had shortened life spans . Another discovery made by Geron collaborators offers further inroads against aging . In the fall of 1998 , scientists extracted embryonic stem cells from aborted human fetuses for the first time . These are the precursors from which all other cells in the body eventually develop . Growing them outside the body will allow scientists to study how an amorphous blob of cells can turn into a heart , or tendon , or bone tissue-little-understood processes of human development . Once such mechanisms are scrutinized , embryonic stem cells hold the even more spectacular promise of generating organs or tissues to replace diseased ones . Excited by the prospect of studying these cells , West left Geron to cofound Origen Therapeutics in 1998 , a business in Burlingame , California , focused on this area of research . But Origen began to center on studying the embryonic stem cells of chickens , not humans . So that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization partly focused on nuclear transfer , or cloning , to create embryonic stem cells from a person 's own body . The company-hopping may seem flighty , but West brushes off his behavior by proclaiming : " I have an unwavering commitment to accomplish something very substantial in the field of aging . I simply am not willing to get sidetracked in that pursuit . " Unlike many researchers in the biological sciences who often sit on the sidelines while big pharmaceutical companies capitalize on their discoveries , West approaches his research with an entrepreneurial spirit honed by early business experience . Between earning his B.S. , M.S. , and Ph.D . degrees , West headed a truck-leasing company with his father . But he cringes at the thought of being characterized as a " trucking business guy who jumped into biotechnology , ' as he puts it . " It 's a bit like characterizing Jimmy Carter as a peanut farmer turned president . " // NUMBER OF PROJECTED CENTENARIANS // PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION AGED 65 YEARS AND OVER // If being a peanut farmer taught Carter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that running the trucking company taught him to do the same . ACT faces a major hurdle : Its research into embryonic stem cells has been challenged by ethical concerns over how the cells are created . ACT 's approach is to fuse a human cell taken from an adult with an egg cell extracted from a cow 's ovarya technique West is confident will not only provide scientists with cells to study aging , but that also holds vast potential in treating the aged . The key to West 's confidence lies in his belief that many of the diseases of aging , like cancer and Alzheimer 's , are nothing more than aging itself . For example , pathologists conducting autopsies commonly see tumors in people in their 30s and 40s who die of causes other than cancer , he says . The same holds true for Alzheimer 's disease in the elderly . Most people over 65 develop the characteristic protein tangles in their brains but in most people , something else kills them before the Alzheimer 's . So by treating the disease with replacement cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect treating aging . Consequently , life spans of 150 years or even longer would surely follow . " I do n't believe it makes any sense not to be able to extend human life . Why would we all live completely free of disease until our 100th birthday and then drop dead ? " he asks . It is this fundamental tenet that sets West and Sprott apart : Sprott does n't think of aging as a disease and finds the view through West 's glasses a little too rosy where human longevity is concerned . Replacement organs and tissues grown from embryonic stem cells might help boost quality of life for the aged , says Sprott , but they wo n't extend the human life span . " I do n't think most of my colleagues believe that we could extend the human life span either , " he adds . " There are a few who think that newborns might be able to make it to 150 years . But for the people who are already kicking around who have collected their share of diseases and have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's much of a chance to live so long . " But even if all researchers were in merry agreement , their predictions on longevity are about as tenable as those of a soothsayer peering at a crystal ball . Comments West : " I remember back in the 1960s when I was a boy reading through science magazines like POPULAR SCIENCE . They showed pictures of robots cleaning houses by the year 2000 . That has n't happened yet . But they also underpredicted the role computers would play in the average person 's life . My point is that we 're terrible at predicting the future . Just as some people born in 1899 live to see 2000 , some people alive today will live to see 2100 . But no one really knows whether they 'll number in the thousands , hundreds of thousands , or millions .

MARK TWAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dazzling uncertainty . More than a century later , we 're still struggling to precisely predict , much less control , the atmospheric conditions around us . Yet researchers are at work on many fronts in the attempt to master the weather . For instance , we 've made some progress in getting clouds to rain more or less on command . Recent studies show that hygroscopic ( water-absorbing ) salts dispersed by aircraft may turn on a rain spigot more effectively than dry ice or silver iodide , cloudseeding tools used since 1946 . The crystals attract water droplets that otherwise would form around tiny specks of dust or other particles and remain too small and light to plunge to earth . " We ca n't yet ' make ' rain , but under the right conditions , hygroscopic crystals are very effective at enhancing precipitation , " says Thomas Henderson , president of Atmospherics Inc. , a cloud-seeding company based in Fresno , California . Henderson says that radar imaging of seeded and unseeded clouds indicates that a touch of airborne salt increases rainfall by 12 to 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more interested in knowing whether it will rain at all-or rain so hard they might expect some damage . Most forecasts are reasonably accurate from about 12 hours out to around five days . Any forecasts closer than that-or more remote-are problematic . But progress is being made in both directions . Nationwide , for instance , there 's growing interest in " nowcasting " - creating highly detailed forecasts for areas that extend out a mere 30 minutes or so . It 's a tough task , says Cindy Mueller , a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado . Looking only at a growing thunderstorm itself , for instance , does n't give you enough information to accurately predict its development and path . " You have to understand the environment that the storm is in , " including storms around it , atmospheric stability , and other factors , Mueller says . Long-term forecasts also are improving thanks to more powerful computers , improved modeling , and satellite and ocean-sensor data . " We 'll probably never be able to say that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Cliff Mass , a meteorologist with the University of Washington . " But we 're learning about different weather cycles and their implications . " What about actually changing the weather ? " The idea of controlling the weather is science fiction , " snorts Roni Avissar , director of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey . A few scientists have thought about the problem sufficiently to underscore just what an ambitious undertaking it would be . For instance , Michael MacCracken , director of the U.S. Global Change Research Program , has estimated the energy created by a powerful hurricane . The heat released from a big hurricane , which is the force that drives its winds , is equal to a 1-megaton nuclear weapon exploding each second . Nevertheless , says MacCracken , people may one day have to seriously consider ways to reverse a different , unintended weather experiment : global warming caused by excess " greenhouse " gases from burning fossil fuels . One idea is to deflect solar radiation with a giant mirror in space . Possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause rather than the symptom ? To do that , we could launch into space large solar collectors that would beam microwave energy to Earth to be used as electricity , replacing fossil fuels . Vast improvements in electronics and remote assembly techniques may someday mean that this weather control , at least , could become science fact rather than science fiction . Clone of Our Own Making yourself in your own image may be the ultimate ethical question . WILL HUMANS be the next clones ? The technology , called nuclear transfer , still has a long way to go before it 's considered safe to try on humans . But even if it were safe , would it be right ? Associate Editor Gunjan Sinha spoke with Hank Greely , who sits on an advisory committee on human cloning for the state of California . Greely is a professor of law and co-director of a program in Genomics , Ethics , and Society at Stanford University in California . PS : When will we clone a human ? Greely : That 's not a simple question . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology that is so wrong or so evil that it should n't be used at all ? Or should it be weighed based on its intended uses ? Photograph Tiny amounts of water-absorbing salts dropped Into clouds can Increase rainfall . Photograph If human reproductive cloning were safe , ethicist Hank Greely would find It acceptable . // PS : What are justifiable uses ? Greely : We really need to distinguish between reproductive cloning and nonreproductive human cloning . If we use nuclear transfer to grow a new liver , I do n't think many people will have problems with that-as long as it 's growing a liver and not taking the liver from a cloned person . Human reproductive cloning is much trickier . PS : Why ? Greely : Safety . There 's still a very low success rate . With Dolly , more than 200 sheep eggs underwent nuclear transfer and 29 were implanted in the uteri of sheep to get one Dolly . We do n't worry too much about sheep miscarriages or about deformed lambs being born . But we would with humans . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy . PS : Dolly appears to be healthy . Why would n't a human clone be so ? Greely : There may be mutations that are initially invisible and only show themselves as the clone ages . There 's also the telomere problem . We know that Dolly 's telomeres the ends of chromosomes in cells , which shorten until the cells can no longer reproduce are shorter than those of other sheep her age , and we do n't know what that means yet . PS : Suppose human cloning was safe . In what situations do you see cloning being used ? Greely : As a fertility aid . We let people do all sorts of things to have a child that 's genetically related , in vitro fertilization for one . PS : Are there other situations where it might be ethically justified to create a human clone ? Greely : A situation where parents want to create a new child to be a bone marrow donor for an older sick child . That 's a real tough one . But this issue might never arise if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another situation is cloning a child who has accidentally died . I think that 's creepy . But I 've never been in that position of having a child die and so I do n't feel comfortable saying whether that 's a good application or a bad application of the technology . PS : What about cloning a Hitler or Michael Jordan ? Greely : I think we can dismiss those as bad or even silly applications . PS : Is there anything else you 'd like to say about the future of human cloning ? Greely : Even if cloning humans were safe and we as a society had decided it was ethically justifiable for reproductive purposes , I do n't think we 'd see a lot of clones . The old-fashioned way of making babies has a lot going for it : It 's easy , traditional , well understood , and occasionally even pleasant . People are not going to give up sex anytime soon . It all started with a // Big Bang but there 's no Big Finish in sight . HOW DID the universe become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventual ' fate ? To shed light on the subject , Executive Editor Mariette DiChristina spoke with astronomer Christopher Impey of the University of Arizona in Tucson , whose research specialty is observational cosmology . PS : How did the universe begin ? Impey : We think the universe started about 12 billion years ago , from a fan tactically hot and dense point , and . , then expanded outward-colloquially called the Big Bang . There are problems ' with the name , because the birth of the . universe did n't make a sound and it was not an explosion , which are major miscon ceptions . Instead , all of space unfolded . The Big Bang has an origin in time but not at any particular point in space . The Big Bang theory is the story of what happened afterward . The story can only be told , with the physics we know , starting about 1 microsecond after the start of the Big Bang . Before that is speculative . After that first microsecond , radiation dominated everything that happened for the first 10,000 years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first couple of minutes , the universe had the temperature of the core of a , star , and it did what a star does-make helium out of hydrogen . In time , expansion cooled the universe , and fusion could n't occur anymore . After that , gravity started to become significant , and things began to form from // the seething froth of material . At 300,000 years , the universe became " transparent . " That 's the point where regular parts of matter go their separate ways and interact rarely . It took maybe half a billion years for the first galaxies to form . The galaxies are made of luminous material but there is also a sea of invisible dark matter , whose existence we infer . The history of the universe now is one of star formation , where space between galaxies is mostly empty . Today , the universe is enormous , and it 's cold and it 's dark . The expansion rate , which was once fast , has decelerated . PS : What happens after this ? How and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the universe is " open " and will expand forever . Eventually , the stars in the galaxies will exhaust their nuclear fuel and go out . Most material will be deposited into remnants like black holes with gravity strong enough to suck in light itself and neutron stars ultradense remains of exploded suns . Like light bulbs on a dimmer , the galaxies will fade away as they continue to be carried apart by the expansion of space . After trillions of years , the lowestmass stars , which are called white dwarfs , will fade out as embers . The really speculative stuff is the ultimate and infinite future of the universe . As Stephen Hawking suggested in the 1970s , even black holes can evaporate , losing material . And eventually , normal matter I like protons and neutrons the building blocks of atoms will decay . Theoretically , that could occur after 1035 years ( 10 with 35 zeros after it ) . The collapsed objects will evaporate into a particle fizz that is the final , bleak fate of the universe .
