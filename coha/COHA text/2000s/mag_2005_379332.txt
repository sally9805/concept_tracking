There was a time when Mohammad al-Obaidi did n't worry much about safety . As a barber in Baghdad 's gritty working-class Washash neighborhood , al-Obaidi would spend his days styling hair  --  for Sunnis , Shi'ites , Christians , whoever showed up at his World of Haircuts barbershop . Evenings , he would slip off to play soccer with friends . These days , however , as Iraq plunges deeper into civil unrest , al-Obaidi , 27 , a stout , personable man who sports a buzz cut , spends much of his time calculating how to stay alive , wondering whether the anonymous killers who now stalk the streets of Washash will come after him , perhaps at his shop or on the long road home . <P> Al-Obaidi was snipping away at a customer 's hair last month when a text message beeped on his cell phone . CHANGE YOUR PROFESSION , it read , OR ELSE YOU 'LL LOSE YOUR HEAD . At first , he thought it was a joke . He immediately called back the number , expecting that he would reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a cop or a U.S. hireling , and he was n't aware that he had any enemies . But in the climate of fanaticism that now prevails in Baghdad , barbers are being singled out by Sunni extremists who say that cutting a man 's beard violates Islam . " Do what we say , " a stranger on the line told him , " or we 'll kill you . " <P> A murder spree has erupted in Washash , as in countless neighborhoods across Baghdad . Death squads , which tend to move in Opel sedans , are entering what once were tight-knit communities and killing ordinary citizens , apparently to stir up sectarian hatred . The goal : to incite a civil war that each side hopes will give its sect dominance over the other . In Baghdad , a city of more than 5 million , there were at least 880 violent deaths last month , according to Faiq Amin Bakr , director of the Baghdad central morgue . ( In New York City , with a population of more than 8 million , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) And the figure for Baghdad excludes those killed by car bombings and suicide attacks , which , if included , would add nearly 100 to the total . Most of the victims were felled by gunshots . Some were beheaded . Few of the murderers have been captured . " Nobody knows who is doing this killing , " says Bakr . " It seems they 're trying to destroy our society . " <P> The U.S. military officials in charge of protecting Baghdad would be hard-pressed to locate Washash on a city map . That 's because it 's one of the few places in the city where insurgents are n't shooting at American soldiers ; the U.S. patrols in their humvees tend to roll right past . But the violence in this neighborhood is an extension of the war the U.S. is waging against Iraqi insurgents . If the direct attacks on American troops are aimed at driving the U.S. out , the killings in Washash are a grim portent of the kind of chaos that may lie in Iraq 's future , whether or not U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops leave , we will have a civil war , " says a Sunni ex-army officer who prefers not to reveal his name . " It will go on until one sect wipes out the other . "
