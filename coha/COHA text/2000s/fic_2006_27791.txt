Monday , January 14 Midway this way of life we 're bound upon , I woke to find myself in a dark wood , where the right road was wholly lost and gone . Clare smelled the smoke first . She came to a standstill , breathing in the chill and windless air . Pine tar and wet wool and the frozen freshwater smell of snow . And smoke . She had crammed as many logs as she could into the cabin 's woodstove before she left that morning , but they would have burnt down into glowing cinders by now , their smoke long vanished into the air . So . Someone had stoked the woodstove . She was n't alone . She clutched her poles and almost -- almost -- turned back into the woods . She had food and matches and a blanket and a knife in her day pack . She could escape . A cold touch on her bare hand startled her . A single fat snowflake melted onto her skin . As she watched , another fell . Then another . She sighed . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the hemlock and white pine , clambering over a hard-packed wall of snow thrown up in the wake of the private road 's plowing . Gathering her poles in one hand , she sprung her bindings , stepped free of her snowshoes , andscooped them up with her free hand . Her legs felt shaky and insubstantial as she tottered toward the cabin . Thank God , thank God , she did n't recognize the SUV parked next to her car . It was a clean , late-model Scout , anonymous in this area where everyone spent the winter in a four-wheel-drive vehicle . She supposed it could belong to a relative of the cabin 's owner . Mr. Fitzgerald had offered the place when she told the congregation she was looking for a post-Christmas retreat , but he was into his early eighties and perhaps had forgotten promising the space to a grandkid . She mounted the steps to the uncovered front deck and hung her snowshoes and poles on two of a row of pegs jutting from the log wall . Please , Lord , let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour-and-a-half drive from Millers Kill would have to be hurting bad . I do n't have it in me to minister right now . She opened the door . The man rooting beneath the kitchen counter stood up and up and up before turning toward her . " Ms. Fergusson . Finally . I confess , I was beginning to feel a bit concerned . " Clare blinked . " Father Aberforth ? " She looked around , as if there might be someone else who could explain why Albany 's diocesan deacon-at-large was standing in the kitchen on a Monday afternoon holding a battered teakettle . The open floor plan did n't leave much scope for hiding , however , unless the presiding bishop was lurking in the bathroom . " What are you doing here ? " Father Aberforth plunked the kettle into the sink and twisted the tap on . " Making tea . " He gestured behind her . " You might want to shut the door before you let all the heat out . " She kicked the door closed without turning around . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were excusing her absence from her parish . Willard Aberforth was known as the bishop of Albany 's hit man , a scarecrow in black who dealt discreetly and firmly with problem priests . And she , they both knew , was a problem priest . Or at least a priest with a problem . " I had n't forgotten that , " he said dryly , shutting off the water and swinging the kettle onto the stove . " I spoke to Father Lawrence before driving up here . To see how everything went . He said you had called him and told him you were coming back early ? " " Tomorrow morning . " " You had Wednesday to Wednesday , you know . " " I know . I just . . . I did what I came up here to do . Now I think getting back to work will be good for me . " Aberforth raised his eyebrows , unfurling an expanse of sagging skin . " Do you have concerns about Father Lawrence 's abilities ? I 'm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , you know . " " Ah . No . No worries . He seemed quite "  - -  geriatric - -   " nice . When I briefed him . Experienced . Very experienced . " " He was a good friend of your predecessor . " The late , lamented Father Hames , who had become St. Alban 's priest around the time Betty Grable was a pin-up girl . " I believed he and your parishioners would feel quite comfortable together . " She had thought , after the events of the past night , that her reserves of grief and dread were plumbed out , but she felt a fresh upwelling of fear at his words . " Are you . . . is the bishop suspending me ? " Father Aberforth looked at her . He had once been a younger and heavier man , and his face fell in deceptively drooping folds , but his black eyes showed that inside he was still all hard lines and angles . " Does that thought distress you ? " " Yes ! " She was surprised how much . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that she was in the right place , that God intended her to be a parish priest rather than a social worker or a chaplain or a helicopter pilot -- her old , easy calling . God had remained resolutely silent on the matter . Maybe now He was talking to her , in the sick clench of her gut . Father Aberforth nodded . " I thought it might . The answer is no , the bishop is not suspending you from your duties . " The last of her energy left her body with her breath . Clare let her day pack thud to the floor and collapsed into a nearby sofa without bothering to remove her parka . She heard the click-click-clicking of the burner as Aberforth turned on the gas and a whoosh as his match lit the ring into flame . " I know you 're a coffee fiend , but there must be tea here somewhere , " he said . " In the pantry . In one of the Tupperware boxes . " She listened to Aberforth rummage around , the clink and clunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear her grandmother Fergusson chiding her to get up and act the hostess , but for once she could n't bring herself to care about Doing the Right Thing . She sat there dully , rubbing her hands over the smooth twill of the sofa cushions . The kettle whistled shrilly and cut off . " Do you take your tea the same way you do your coffee ? Ridiculously sweet ? " " Gosh , " she said . " You remember . " She waited without expectation as he crossed the floor and set a mug on the table in front of her . He folded himself into one of the leather Eames-style chairs opposite the sofa . It was n't meant for Aberforth 's storklike six and a half feet , and he struggled to get comfortable for a moment before snatching a kilim pillow off the companion chair and stuffing it beneath his knees . " Idiotic furniture , " he said . " Where did you find this place ? " " Belongs to one of my parishioners , " she said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago . " Father Aberforth grunted . " Drink your tea . You look half dead . " She reached for the hot mug with as little effort as possible and managed a few sips . " What are you doing here , Father ? I did n't think we were due for another chat until after I had sorted myself out up here . " " My visit has two purposes . " Clare smiled to herself . Who but Willard Aberforth talked like that ? " First , to tell you that the bishop has assigned you a new deacon . " She cradled the warm mug between her hands . " I do n't need an assistant . " " This will be a full-time position , salary paid for by the diocese . " Clare looked closely at the old man . " St. Alban 's is n't large enough or prosperous enough to warrant a full-time deacon . " " Nevertheless . " The penny dropped . " I 'm getting a babysitter . " " Consider her more of a guide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emphasis on the straight . " It had been her celebration of a gay union the year before that originally brought her to the bishop's -- and Aberforth's -- attention . She had broken her vows of obedience and flouted the bishop 's policy toward homosexuals , both faults she had admitted but failed to repent of . She had been waiting for the bishop 's reaction since last November , but the flaming car crash that was her personal life had kept her distracted . Now she tweaked to something else Aberforth had said . " Her ? " " The Reverend Elizabeth de Groot . She was raised up from St. James in Schuylerville . Since you 'll be back tomorrow , I 'll let her know she can report for duty as of Tuesday . " " Is she transitional ? " That is , on the road to priesthood , which would give Clare some chance that the woman would be shuffled off to another parish within a year . " Oh no . She 's a career deacon . She was ordained over a decade ago after helping build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volunteer and a vestry member and a warden . " Clare translated that to mean old enough to be your mother and has already seen it all twice . " What 's she like ? " " An elegant lady . Dignified . She has a lovely sense of tradition . " Clare translated that to mean so high church she makes the archbishop of Canterbury look like a guitar-strumming folksinger . She sighed . It was n't as if there were anything she could do . As a response to her transgressions , it was fairly mild . " So that 's the one thing , " she said . " What 's the other ? " Father Aberforth fussed a bit with his tea . " I came to check on you . To see if you needed to talk . Having found myself in the position of your confessor . " Clare smiled faintly . " You ca n't take confession . " Despite his honorary title of " Father , " the deacon was not eligible to act as God 's intermediary when people spilled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholeheartedly in the rite than did Clare , who forgave sins on a weekly basis . " It would n't do you any good if you were n't prepared to repent and mend your ways , " he said . She could feel her cheeks coloring . " Yes , I thought this retreat had more to do with your situation than with some post-Christmas and Epiphany exhaustion . Have you figured out what you 're going to do with this married man of yours ? " He craned his neck , trying to peer over the edge of the upstairs loft . " He 's not staying here with you , is he ? " She did n't know whether to laugh or cry . " No . No , he is n't . " He pierced her with his black eyes . " I 'm not here to judge you , girl . You think you 're the first sheep to wander out of the fold because greener pastures beckon ? " He reached for his tea . " At least you show some originality . Most priests who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the warden 's wives . The town 's chief of police -- that 's novel . Not too bright , but novel . " " Do n't hold back . Please , tell me what you think . " " Straight talking is exactly what you need at this point , Ms. Fergusson . " He was right , and she knew it . The deacon made for a strange confidante -- he did n't approve of women priests , he was formal to the point of eccentricity , and , most damning of all , he reported directly to her boss . But there was something about his dry , unsentimental demeanor that had made it easy , over the past two months , to tell him everything . About how lonely she had been , a stranger in a strange place , looking out onto a sea of faces waiting expectantly for her to either fail miserably or to walk on water . About making friends with the only person in town who looked at her and saw plain old Clare Fergusson instead of a bundle of assumptions in a dog collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-lit path with Russ Van Alstyne , talking and laughing and ignoring the signs screaming danger : off trail and entering unpatrolled land and go no farther this means you and then being surprised -- surprised !  - -  when she looked around and found she was utterly lost . Something of the wilderness must have shown in her face , because Aberforth leaned forward awkwardly against his Eames-spindled knees and said , " I have n't said anything to the bishop yet , but you 're going to need to come to a decision soon , Ms. Fergusson . Not for him or for me or for the people in your parish . For the sake of your own soul . " She nodded mechanically . " I know , Father . And I 've . . . " Her voice faded off . How could she describe the past few weeks ? Days ? These last terrible hours ? " I 've taken steps . " She picked up her mug of tea , watching with a clinical interest as her hand shook . " Unless something extraordinary happens , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continues ...
