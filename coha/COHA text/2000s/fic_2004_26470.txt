Mr. Timothy A Novel Chapter One Not so tiny any more , that 's a fact . Nearly five-eight , last I was measured , and closing in on eleven stone . To this day , people find it hard to reckon with . My sister Martha , by way of example , would n't even meet my eye last time I saw her , had to fuss at my shirt buttons and stare at my chest , as though there were two dew-lashed orbs blinking out of my breastbone . Did n't matter I 've half a foot on her now , she still wanted to be mothering me , and her with a full brood of her own  --  six , last I counted  --  and a well-oiled husband gone two nights for every night he 's home , why would she want more bodies to tend ? But she does , and old habits , and let the woman have what she wants , so on this last occasion , I dropped to my knees and looked straight at the sky with that look I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I sang " Annie Laurie . " And Martha laughed and boxed my ear and said Out with you , but I think it pleased her , remembering me smaller , everything else smaller , too . The iron brace was bought by a salvager long ago , and the crutch went for kindling shortly after  --  quite the ceremonial moment  --  and all that 's left , really , is the limp , which to hear others tell it is not a limp but a lilt , a slight hesitation my right leg makes before greeting the pavement , a metrical shyness . Uncle N told me once to call it a caesura , but this produced looks of such profound unknowing I quickly gave it up . I now refer to it as my stride . My hitch-stride . A lovely forward connotation that I quite fancy , although I ca n't honestly say I 've been moving forwards , not in the last sixmonth . But always better to leave that impression . I never think of the leg , truthfully , until the weather begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , by the small ring of fire just under the right buttock . Fall is the dull , prodding ache in the hip joint , and winter is a bit of a kick in the knee . The whole kneecap sings for three or four days solid , and no amount of straightening or bending or ignoring will stop the music . It 's winter now . The twelfth of December , to be specific , a date I am commemorating by staying in bed . I ca n't say bed rest does the knee any better , but if I lie still long enough , the knee merges with the rest of me and dissipates . Or perhaps I should say everything else dissipates ; I forget even how to move my arm . Many years ago , a doctor with violet nostrils and kippery breath informed my mother that the paralysis in my leg would , left untreated , rise through me like sap , up the thigh and the hip , through the lower vertebrae , the breastbone , the lungs , to settle finally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stilled forever . Being just six , and possessing an accelerated sense of time , I assumed this would happen very quickly  --  in three or four hours , let us say  --  so I made a special point of saying good-bye to Martha and Belinda because they were rather nicer than Jemmy and Sam , and I told Peter if he wanted my stool , he could well have it , and that night , I lay on my pallet , waiting to go , pinching myself every few seconds to see if the feeling had vanished yet . And I suppose after all that pinching , it did . only a matter of time , then , before the heart went . I lay there listening in my innermost ear for the final winding-down , wondering what that last , that very last beat would sound like . Well , you can imagine how alarmed I was to awake the next morning and find the ticker still jigging . Felt a bit cheated , if you must know . And perhaps by way of compensation , I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . I dream I 'm back in Camden Town , except now I 'm too big for everything : the stool , the bed , the crutch . Even the ceiling crowds a little , I have to stoop or lean against the wall . My feet are rooted to the ground . The sap is rising . I 've already lost the feeling in my hands , the last draughts of air are being squeezed from my lungs , and my heart is thumping loud enough to wake the dead-and I realise then that the heart does n't shut down at all , it keeps beating long after everything else has stopped , it 's a separate organism altogether , and in a fury of betrayal , I grab for it , raking my fingers along the rib cage , and my lung squeezes out one last accordion blast of air , and that 's when I cry out . I 'm never sure whether I 've actually cried out or whether it 's part of the dream , but it always leaves me feeling exposed in some deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes inventing plausible excuses for the neighbours who will come pounding on my door any minute , demanding an explanation . The neighbours never come , of course . I have the great fortune of sleeping in an establishment where loud cries are part of the ambience . indeed , in Mrs. Sharpe 's lodging house , one might scream " Murder ! " several times in quick succession and elicit nothing more than indulgent smiles from the adjoining rooms . Murder here being simply another fantasy , and fantasy being the prevailing trade . The only person within earshot of me most nights is Squidgy , the droopshouldered , hairy-eared gentleman with a tonsure of white hair who comes three times a week to be punished for the infractions he committed in public school half a century ago ...
