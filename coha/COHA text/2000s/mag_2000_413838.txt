THE ART MARKET HAS BECOME ONE BIG , BOOMING PARTY , AND , SOMEBODY 'S GOT TO MAKE IT GLAMOROUS . NANCY JO SALE MEETS THE YOUNG WOMEN WHO KEEP THE GALLERIES-AND THE SCENE-GOING . PHOTOGRAPHED BY SASHA BEZZUBOV Photograph Photograph // Christina Lee , a model-like Korean-American beauty , floats around the courtyard of P.S.1 , the contemporary-art center in Long Island City , New York . She 's like a car-show hostess , waving , smiling , all even hand movements . She is P.S.I 's registrar , a kind of multipurpose manager and one of a handful of young women in the New York art world who make things happen behind the scenes . They 're known as " gallerinas , " though few of them embrace the term . " I do n't use the word . I think people take me pretty seriously , " says Lee , who walks with grace even as her high heels sink into the rocky gravel . It 's a brilliantly sunny day in September , the day of P.S.1 's fall opening , and the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know everyone : " Oh , hi , Leo " - it 's Leo Koenig , the art dealer with the Stray Cats hair ; " Inka , hi , how are you ? " - Inka Essenhigh , the fashionable painter who 's getting so much press lately . " What did you think of our John Wesley exhibit ? " Lee asks . " Oh , I think he 's a great artist , " says Essenhigh . " Mysterious , gritty . " " Yes , " says Lee , " there 's a subversive edge-like Lichtenstein . " Lee , 29 , has worked hard for this day , installing the exhibits , negotiating for loans , dealing with shipping and insurance . " We borrow a painting , and there are conditions , " she explains . Julian LaVerdiere , the platinum  --  haired sculptor , takes her hands , kisses her cheek . " She juggles 100 balls at once-she 's one to watch , " he says . " No , you are , " Lee insists . " Julian 's becoming very famous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , continuing her tour through the oncoming stream of art lovers . " Artists can be difficult , and it 's important to be friends with them . " Suddenly she cocks her head to the side : " Oh , hi , Jane " - the painter Jane Benson . " We were partying last night at artist Shahzia Sikander 's house , " Lee says as she walks on . " That 's why I 'm hungover . " She does n't look it . She has perfect skin , careful makeup , the shiniest hair ; her brown highlights were done for the opening today . Her dress , by Indian designer Alpana Bawa , seems well chosen , with a modern-art-ish design in fuchsia and gold , and oval slits around the hips . " For better or worse , " Lee says , " image has become extremely important in the art world . " In fact , women all over the art business seem to be almost as pretty as Lee . As one collector says , " That 's the hook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors to spend sometimes millions , it 's not surprising they present a nice face to look at while making an argument for why a piece of art is worthwhile . And to make the argument , they also have to have the education . Lee graduated from Barnard and has worked at Christie 's , Sotheby 's , MoMA , and the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Her head tilts sideways again for another name . " Oh , Henry , how are you ? This is Henry Urbach ; he has a gallery in Chelsea-it 's a great gallery , very up-and-coming . " Urbach and his boyfriend , Stephen Hartman , smile back . " I think a generation ago , " says Lee , a while later , having a smoke , " the art world was heavily dominated by men , and you had to be a raving bitch to make it . But now it 's pretty equal  --  there are many powerful women . " And with their power-especially in the current boom-money and fame can follow . It happened for Mary Boone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for bitchiness ) . " Mary Boone is a historical figure , " says Lee . " One ca n't deny her significance . But I do n't think her approach fits into the current art scene . " She smiles . " I should probably not elaborate . " One of the more consuming pastimes of gallery managers is networking ; like any sales profession , theirs demands a lot of lunches , dinners , and parties at which to make connections with buyers . In New York , they can be seen almost any night at Bottino , in Chelsea , or at Passerby , the bar adjacent to Gavin Brown 's Enterprise ( a gallery ) . On a balmy Tuesday evening , around eight o'clock , you can see a cocktail party going on through the wide bay windows of a pink stone building on St. Marks Place . The guests inside-men in white button-downs and women in minimalist dresses  --  look like a scene out of Whit Stillman 's Metropolitan . It 's Kristine Bell 's biweekly " salon . " " We just started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be really big . " Bell , 28 , is the manager of Zwirner &; Wirth , a high-end secondary-market gallery ( they buy at auction or bring in works on consignment from private dealers and collectors ) on the Upper East Side . She is a princess among Ballerinas-a storybook blonde with wide blue eyes and a birdlike frame . She 's wearing a scoop-neck dress and standing , barefoot , in her candlelit kitchen , which is already loud with the sound of the animated connection-fest in the next room . Photograph Photograph // " The art world is very difficult to navigate , " Bell says above the din . " So you have to commit a lot of time to socializing . " Bell has her eye on Michael McCracken , an investor in ugo.com . " He 's my main Internet guy , " she says . Her eyes sparkle over a glass of white wine . McCracken ca n't seem to take his eyes off his hostess . " It 's harder to be a woman in the art world and socialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on as barhopping-you walk a fine line . It 's important not to give a wrong impression . " She says she does n't have a boyfriend at the moment . " I 'm so busy . " " I have a bit of a crush on her , " says a young British sculptor in the kitchen , a bit tipsily . " She 's beautiful ! Do n't tell my girlfriend . " " Kristine 's the absolute star , " says the party 's cohost Joshua Briggs , who works at the Tony Shafi-azi gallery ( which would make him a " gallerino " ) . " To make it , you 've got to know your stuff , and you 've got to be quite pretty . It 's very competitive . You have to know what you want out of it all . " " I want to develop my own clientele , " says Bell . She started out wanting to be a painter , but in her second year at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago , the specter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this was going to leave me in four years , " she says . So she went to Paris and London to study art history , then moved to New York , where she landed a job at Feigan , the gallery owned by master dealer Richard Feigan . " He told me how things work , " Bell says , " what faces to know , how a deal is made . " She became tireless in what she calls " the social side of things , going to every opening and event . I 've stood in the standing room of every auction in New York since I 've been here . People get to know who you are . " Eventually , as assistant to Ame Glimcher at the Pace Wildenstein gallery , " I handled some of the most high-profile dealers , " Bell says . Her buzzer is ringing again . More people she needs to know are coming up the stairs . On a Sunday evening , two other women in the art business are having dinner with their boyfriends at Bar Pitti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Sara Jo Romero , director of the Holly Solomon Gallery , and Kyrie Tinch , an account executive at MF Productions , a company that throws the art world 's hot-ticket charity events . Their boyfriends are Jonathan Newman and Greg Bogin , relaxed , handsome painters . As they talk , the subject inevitably turns to the current crop of curiously , exceptionally pretty young female artists-Cecily Brown , Rachel Feinstein , et al. - dubbed the Beautiful Young Things by The New York Times . " The concept of an art superstar who 's a woman like Cecily Brown is really a new one , " says Newman . " For men it 's been around forever , so they can sit back like , I 'm a slob , a pig . " But the women artists are defining a look for themselves  --  whether they decide they 're gon na be dressed in Calvin Klein or sloppy painter pants . And if it 's sloppy painter pants , then maybe Calvin Klein will do sloppy painter pants . " " Oh , no , not Calvin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " Fashion and art are coming closer together , " says Tinch . " Fashion ads in Artforum ! " says Romero . " You never saw that before . Fashion designers are being inspired by artists . " " You look at fashion , " says Newman , " and it looks like art , and you look at art and it looks like fashion . " " But a lot of people are uncomfortable with that , " says Tinch . " I think the danger of art and fashion coming too close together is that artists will be chasing the flavor of the month , and the scope and depth of their work will be lost . " A couple of weeks later , on a muggy weekday afternoon , quizzical passersby peer through a window on Grand Street that has been painted to say NICOLA COSTANTINO : HUMAN FURRIER . The place is set up to look like a fancy SoHo dress shop , full of rubbery pink jackets , dresses , corsets-all of which , on closer inspection , appear to be made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Incredible , right ? " says Amalia Dayan . This is Deitch Projects-one of two galleries owned by star art dealer Jeffrey Deitch-and Dayan is its 28-year-old director . " People really ca n't take their eyes off this , " she says . Nothing would seem to be more difficult to discuss with refinement than garments made from people , but Dayan  --  who is , of course , strikingly beautiful , a dark-haired Israeli with pale green eyes-manages . Her accent helps . " It is see-lee-con , " she says of the fabric . " I think it 's amazing , really original . It 's pushing the definition of art-what is art ? What is fashion ? What is design ? " she asks . Tough questions . What she 's wearing is easier to guess-it 's chic and black . " It is a Gucci skirt , " says Dayan , " and a vintage top I got at the flea market in Chelsea " - an outfit that puts her squarely in the middle of the fashion moment , par for the course for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women artists currently influencing fashion trends . " Costantino 's work is visceral but very elegant , " Dayan continues . " Go ahead , touch it . It 's a very strong comment about the classical human body and the grotesque body and identity issues . " As for her own identity , it 's more of a pedigree-her grandfather 's name was Moshe , and he was that same fierce general with the eye patch . Whatever her background , Jeffrey Deitch says later , on the phone , she is " one of the most impressive people of her generation in the art world today . " Deitch himself started out working backstage at the John Weber Gallery 25 years ago , " hanging paintings , answering telephones . That 's how you learn , " he says . " But the most important thing is to have a sensitivity to the art , " he adds , " to understand what makes a work significant-which requires a set of skills not that different from what the artists have . " There are n't that many people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Gagosian Gallery in September is-at a time when every artist seems to be want to be a rock star-the true rock-star event . Hundreds of art lovers are waiting outside in drizzling rain , pushing to get in . Inside , the Ballerinas have gained easy entrance , along with a long list of celebrities from Steve Martin to Martha Stewart . There are Ballerinas in backless halter tops , in embroidered , fringed jeans and vintage peasant shirts , in striped ' ' 70s dresses , and of course , in Prada . There are gallerinas who-but for their multiple languages , degrees , and ability to converse intelligently about Tintoretto-could not be distinguished from aspiring female rock stars themselves . The show includes gynecological chairs submerged underwater and bags of trash . Kristine Bell is here , but she does n't seem to care much for the show-she takes it in , wrinkling her perfect nose . She seems to be searching for the comment that will put her feelings into words most diplomatically . She looks around at all the artists , all the Ballerinas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
