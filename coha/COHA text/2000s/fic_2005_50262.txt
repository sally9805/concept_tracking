A few years ago , there was a spate of novels from independent presses that focused on the future of cigarette smoking . They bore titles like Smoke Easy and The Last Cigarette and seemed to reflect widespread vilification of the tobacco industry . Now we 're in 2005 and here we have a story with a different perspective on the future of cigarette smoking . Those of you who remember M. Shayne Bell 's story " Anomalous Structures of My Dreams " from a couple of years ago might begin to wonder if there 's a theme anthology in the offing-if there is , we 'll leave it to anthologists Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois to come up with a book title that takes our breath away . <p> NORMA GAVE UP SMOKING when she found out she was pregnant with Lenny . Everybody congratulated her and said how important it was not to smoke when you were pregnant . It was bad for the baby . Norma understood and promised herself she 'd start the day he was born . But , heck . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albuquerque Hospital and was trying so hard to just to breathe and stay alive , she decided she 'd give him a couple of years . Get him past nursing and stuff . Once he was strong enough , she 'd go back . Tomas did n't approve of smoke inhalation . Nothing that did n't go up the nose was a good idea . He was ecstatic that she stayed off tobacco . Or , he would have been if he had n't been shot down the week before she found out she was pregnant . He was fronting for the Turban-Kings but had developed a deep affection for their brand of cocaine . Tomas had been pretty but Norma had always known he would n't last long . With Tomas gone , Norma had to get a job . She sighed and hit the streets . She would have had to find one anyway . After six weeks of fruitless searching , Norma landed a job as a clerk for Frost Fabrications near the University . She contented her lapsed habit by lingering in the cigarette fumes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Town . She could often be found standing in front of the cantina down the street next to an old Mexican smoking a gloriously obnoxious cigar . With the occasional secondhand smoke from disgruntled office workers grabbing a quick one on the loading dock , Norma managed to keep herself on the low end of satisfied . Just a couple of years , she told herself . Then , she 'd light up and everything would be fine . But when Lenny turned five , a whole series of commercials about how secondhand smoke caused learning disabilities were broadcast . Norma was pretty sure that once she started back again she would n't be able to keep from smoking in the house . She grimly decided she could stick it out until Lenny got into the habit of studying . . Norma was fifty when Lenny turned ten : the danger years , said the magazines . When anybody could suddenly drop dead of a heart attack . Cigarettes caused heart attacks , did n't they ? She did n't want Lenny to have to bury her , did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thirty and had been on the Albuquerque police force for a while , Norma figured she 'd done enough . If she died , she died . She was seventy now . It was now Lenny 's duty to bury her . He 'd do it eventually one way or the other . Her first puff was everything she 'd remembered : the burn down the throat , the tingling all the way to her fingers and toes , the quick , sharp rush up into her face and behind her eyes . She felt brighter and happier than she 'd been in years . It was like the first time she lit up , way back when she was thirteen and living in Portales . And , just like when she was thirteen , after a minute or two she turned green and threw up . Oh , well , she thought philosophically . You pay for your pleasures . In no time at all she was back up to a couple of packs a day . Lenny , of course , was appalled . He came over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was always music in Norma 's house : blues , country , classical , rock . If she could sing it , she had it on . Not that Norma could sing . Her voice had been described as having all the subtlety and color of a downtown bus at rush hour . Norma did n't care . First Lenny tried desperately to talk her out of it . " Come on , Ma , " he pleaded . " It 's been years . You 're over seventy . Do n't throw it away now . " Then , he got belligerent and refused to let her come over to his house to see her grandkids . That lasted a week . They lived down the street in the same sort of four-room bungalow she did . If she could n't go over there , they came over here . Once pleading and threats did n't work , he tried covert operations . He broke into her house after duty and threw away every pack of cigarettes he could find . This last trick might have worked . Cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same job after thirty years . What she needed was a way to smoke cigarettes without having them in the house . Or , better , cigarettes cheap enough she could afford to lose a few packs a month as the cost of doing business . The Internet , she discovered , holds the answer to all things . Reginald Cigarettes , a tiny company based in the Sandwich Islands ( which used to be Hawaii until they seceded ) sold cigarettes by direct mail . This had many advantages . First , she gave them the address of a packing services company nearby - that way Lenny could n't take them out of the mailbox before she could get to them . second , they were cheaper since they were being sold from another country ( no taxes ! ) . Third , they were also artificial . When she was finally found out and cornered , she could use the site 's propaganda about how much better they were than real cigarettes . Not that Norma cared . She figured she could empty a few packs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reginalds came , she found she liked them . True , they did n't taste quite as good as Marlboros . But the tingle was better and , as had to happen eventually , when Lenny found out about them and she showed him the pack " See ? " she cried shrilly. " see ? They 're better for me . " " Ma , " protested Lenny . He looked at the pack . " They still got tobacco in them . " " But look at the numbers on the side . They 're waybetter than Marlboros . " Lenny sighed . By that , Norma knew she had won . She had her cigarettes . All was right with the world . Five years later , she got up with her usual morning cough . She rolled out of bed and padded downstairs to put on the coffee . While she waited for it to perk , she put on the morning classics station . It was opera week , which she loved , and they were working their way through some ancient recordings of Enrico Caruso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was a girl . Still coughing , Norma hacked around the house for a while . Well , she certainly coughed like the Great Caruso . While she waited for the really deep one that signaled the start of the day , she thought about renting that old film about him , the one starring Mario Lanza . Something stuck in her throat . Something that would n't come out . Panicky , she went to the sink to get a drink of water , but the spasms in her chest nearly knocked her off her feet . It was all she could to hold on and stand upright . Whatever it was , it clawed its way up her throat and she spat it out into the sink , bloody and covered in mucous . It was perhaps a quarter of an inch across and twice that in length . She reached down and picked it up . It was spongy and felt surprisingly firm . Norma rinsed it off . She guessed this was it , then . Just like Lenny had always told her . Lung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only not so soon . She sighed . You pay for your pleasures . The radio dimmed a little and Norma reached over and turned it up , still looking at the bit of diseased flesh that had come from inside her . It vibrated in her hand . Curious , Norma put her ear to it . Faintly , but unmistakably , it was singing along with Caruso on the radio . Doing a pretty good job , too . The doctor had no explanation . They sat in his office as he went over the test results . Norma was dying for a smoke . Hm . She thought to herself . That was pretty good . She giggled . Dr. Peabody looked up at her and frowned so Norma stifled herself . This was clearly no laughing matter . She 'd laugh later . When she had a cigarette . " Mrs. Carstairs - " " Miss . " " Beg pardon ? " " I 've never married . Miss will do . " Dr. Peabody nodded . " The truth is I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there . Something 's up your trachea and into your larynx . We 'll have to run more tests . Do you smoke ? " " Sure do . Two packs a day of Reginalds . " " I see . " Norma could see the effort Dr. Peabody made not to look disgusted . " Tests . " She picked up her purse . " You might want this , then . " Norma brought an envelope out of her purse and put it on his desk . It looked a little dry so Norma got up and wet a paper towel and moistened the little thing . Even with the water , it was still dead , " This is ... ? " She put it in his hand and shrugged . " I have no idea . But that 's what I got inside me . Coughed it up yesterday . Thought it might help . " Dr. Peabody did n't answer . He was staring at the fleshy bit in his hand . DR . PEABODY ASKED her to come back the following week . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least three other doctors there for moral support . The medical consensus was , apparently , that she had lung cancer of a rare if not unknown type . She should be admitted at once . In his office , Norma stared at the radiographs as if she were interested . Then she smiled at them sweetly and asked if she could go to the bathroom . They nodded , all together as if they were attached to the same string . Outside the office , Norma walked down the hall and out through the parking garage . She went home and sat at her kitchen table , drinking a glass of wine and smoking one of her Reginalds . Dr. Peabody called Lenny , of course . Before the afternoon was finished , Lenny was pounding on her door . " What do you want , Lenny ? " she asked from the other side . " For Christ 's sake , Mom . You know what I want . I want you to go to the doctor . " She sipped her wine - the bottle was mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to . " " What kind of answer is that ? You want to die ? Peabody said you got a good chance if you get some treatment now . " She shook her head . Remembered Lenny could n't see her and said , " No . " , ... .. " Are you drunk , Mom ? " " No ! " she said defensively . " You should n't be drinking at your age . " " I had a deprived childhood and now I 'm making up for it . " " Come on , Mom ! You got to go . " Norma leaned her head against the door . " No , " she said clearly and quietly . " No , I do n't . " " Mom ! " " This is my choice , " she shouted back at him . " It 's my lungs . They were my cigarettes . If I ca n't choose whether or not to die , what choice do I have ? " " Look . If you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Mother Church and ask them . They 'll tell you to get your ass up to the hospital . " " That 's no way to talk to your Mother . " " This is no kind of conversation to have through a door . " " Why not ? " She knocked on the wood . " It 's a perfectly good door . " He was silent for a minute . She could almost see him rubbing his forehead . " Let me come in . " She shook her head again . " I 'll talk to you tomorrow . " Norma left him shouting at the door and walked unsteadily upstairs to bed . You should always have a good , hard bed , Norma reasoned . That way when you get too drunk to stand , you wo n't roll off . She could n't keep Lenny out of her house forever . She did n't even want to . Norma was proud of her son , shy and thin when he was young , now so strong and tall . She always did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was what had attracted her to Tomas in the first place . The TurbanKings had uniforms of a sort . Lenny wanted a good , reasoned argument why she would n't go in for treatment . Norma did n't have one . Just a strong feeling that this was the body she came in with ; it ought to be the body she went out with . But he was wearing her down . A week after she 'd left Dr. Peabody , she went to the 7-11 for her regular rations of bread and ice cream . She came home to see a young man sitting on her stoop , a briefcase next to him . He stood up as she came near . He was odd looking - too thin , for one . His obviously expensive suit that had been cleverly cut to hide it but still , like light through a window , his thinness shone through . His cheekbones were apparent and were it not for the fullness of his lips and his large eyes , he might have looked gaunt . As it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monk who regretted his vow . He stepped forward . " Miss Carstairs ? " he asked , holding out his hand . " Yes , " she said warily , stepping back . " I 'm Ben Cori . " He dropped his hand to his side . " I 'm Reginald Cigarettes . " She looked at him for a moment . Things clicked together in her mind . " This has something to do with my lung cancer . " He smiled at her . " It does . " " What 's special about lung cancer if you 're a smoker ? " " Can we talk inside ? " Norma shrugged . " Ca n't hurt me , I suppose . " Ben 's hands were long and delicate and his wrists seemed lost in the sleeves of his jacket . Now that he was sitting at her table , Norma had a sudden respect for Ben 's tailor . The suit fooled the eye so that he merely appeared to be thin . Ben was a bundle of sticks in a sack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his coffee . " No . Just the engineer . Also , CEO , COO and CFO . President and Board of Directors . Salesman and website designer . I had to hire a lawyer . " She sat up . " I do n't get it . " Ben leaned back in his chair . The chair did n't so much as creak under his weight . " I designed the tobacco product . It 's made in a small factory down in Cuba . Then , the factory ships the resulting product to a cigarette packing company in North Carolina . From there , the packs go to a shipping company in New Jersey . The website is hosted by a company in South Africa and sends the orders to New Jersey . The U.S. Mail delivers it to you . Reginald is incorporated in Hawaii . The only part of Reginald that really exists is an office in my home in Saint Louis . " Ben sipped his coffee . " I see , " said Norma . " You design cigarettes ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I design small machines whose nature it is to take tobacco , tear it apart and rebuild it with reduced carcinogens and toxins . Dried tobacco leaves from all over the South come into the factory and something that resembles dried tobacco leaves come out of the factory . Tobacco product . " " What 's that got to do with me ? " Ben opened his briefcase and brought out two radiographs . He carefully placed the first one in front of Norma . " That 's your lungs . " " I 've seen it . How did you get this ? " " I 've been working the net for a while . You can find anything if you have enough time and money . " He placed a second radiograph next to the first . " That 's a normal case of lung cancer . " Next to each other , the differences were obvious . The normal lung cancer - if such a disease could actually be called normal - looked splotchy and irregular . Her lungs had something in them made up of lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm pretty sure that 's an amplifier . Next to it is a low pass filter . A pretty sophisticated filter from what I can tell . These circles are sensors of some kind . " Looking at the picture made her chest hurt . " What the hell have I got inside of me ? " " I do n't know . " " Do you know how it happened ? " Ben nodded . " No . Whatever happened is impossible . " " Impossible ? " She pointed at the pictures . " It 's right there in front of me . " Ben nodded , smiled at her . " That it is . " " Pretty big stretch to be impossible . " " I know that . " Norma stared at him for a minute . " Okay . Explain it to me . " Ben pulled some more papers from his briefcase . " In my business , mites , tiny machines about the size of a cell , do all the work . We got a bad shipment of mites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal mites did and left some clusters in the tobacco that got through all of the quality control mechanisms , the heating , the cutting and packaging , the irradiation , until the finished cigarettes reached you . Then , they suddenly started working inside of you , not in some random destructive manner but in a controlled construction . I can guess what might have happened but , in point of fact , it 's impossible . " Norma spoke slowly . " I have tiny machines in my lungs ? Machines you built ? " " Close . I do n't know what they 're encoded to do . Nobody knows . " " How many ... clusters got out ? " " From what I can tell , only one . " " How do you know that ? " Ben spread his hands . " So far , you , and only you , have shown anything . " He pointed at Norma . " " Pretty long odds . " " Not as long as some . " " So what are your mites doing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mites were contaminated with other mites with different natures . Mites are built to cooperate so I 'm not sure what they are doing . " " What were they supposed to do ? " asked Norma . " All different things . One set built musical instruments , " said Ben , leaning on the table . " Oboes . Flutes . Tubas . Or , since they came from India , sitars or something . Some were designed to implement a communication system designed in Germany . There were banana preparation mites ordered from Malaysia . Others . " Norma remembered the singing of the fleshy bit . " I have tiny machines making music in my lungs . Your tiny machines . " " As I said , they 're not my mites . My mites died properly . " " Are you sure you 're not a lawyer ? " " If I was a lawyer , I would n't be here . " " Why are you here ? " He stared at his hands and did n't speak for a few seconds . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean ? " Ben leaned toward her . " By any stretch of the imagination , the mites should have just consumed you , made you into some intermediate random product . My mites , acting out of my programming , would try to make you into tobacco product . Something that , to you , would be invariably gruesome and fatal . But that 's not what the mites inside of you are doing . They 're building something inside you . Something integrated - which I can see from the pictures , as well as noticing that you 're still walking around . " " Walking right down to the clinic so Dr. Peabody can cut them out . " " That 's why I 'm here . To try to persuade you not to . " Norma stared at him . " Are you nuts ? " Ben smiled . " Maybe . Mites and humans are made up of much the same things : carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , some metals . If we come from the dust of the earth , then so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected and impossible has happened . A miracle . " " A miracle ! " " Yes . " . . " That 's like saying cancer is a miracle . " Ben shook his head . " Not at all . Cancer is the emergent property of the accumulated errors in an ordered system . It 's the consequences of random events . " Norma shook her head . The way he talked made her dizzy . " How 's this any different ? " " Cancer in a system makes the system untenable . It does n't do anything to make the system any better . It 's not creative . This is going to make you something better . " " It 's going to kill me . That 's what it 's going to do . " Ben shrugged . " There 's a risk to everything . But we come from the earth . So do these mites . The earth speaks through us . They speak through the mites , too . " He pointed to the radiographs . " That low pass filter looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells . I did n't design it . None of the programming in any of the contaminant mites had anything like it . They developed this on their own . This is no cancer . " " But like cancer it 's going to kill me . " " You were going to let the cancer do that anyway , or you would n't have walked out of Peabody 's office . " " That was different . " Norma thought for a moment . " The cancer was mine . It was my own body telling me it was time to go . These things are ... invading me . " " A cluster is made up of a few hundred mites . It 's about the size of a mustard seed . It took root in you - not just anybody . It 's making something in you - nobody else . " " You 're saying these things chose me ? " " No . They ca n't choose anything . They 're just little automatons . Like chromosomes or sperm . A baby is the emergent property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice in the matter . Out of such automata comes you and me . The mites did n't choose you . The earth itself chose you . " " You are nuts . These things are still going to kill me . " " We can stack the odds . " He brought out an inhaler from his briefcase . " This is FTV . All mites are designed so they stop operation when FTV is present . FTV saturates the air in mite factories as a safety precaution . If you inhale this , it might at least slow down their progress . " " That goes against your plan , does n't it ? " " No . Think of it as prenatal care . It gives the mites an opportunity to more thoroughly understand their environment . " Norma thought of the singing again . " What if they escape ? I do n't want to destroy the world or something . " Ben brought a square instrument out of his briefcase . " This has been sampling the air for the whole time I 've been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could be waiting . Like fungus spores . " " Now who 's nuts ? " She considered . " Could Peabody cut them out ? " Ben shook his head . " I do n't think so . The mites are cooperating . If you cut out a chunk of the network , they 'll just try to rebuild it and they 'll have to relearn what they lost plus figure out the new topology resulting from the surgery . I think it would just make things worse . " " That 's what you would say regardless , is n't it ? " Ben shrugged again and said nothing . She had been ready to just die and be gone . At least , this way would make it more of an adventure . She drew a ragged breath . She had no difficulty breathing yet . No more than usual . " Okay , " she said . " I 'm in . " , LIFE SEEMED to settle back to normal . She did n't cough anything up anymore . Her voice cracked and quavered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small price to pay for robots living in her lungs . Reginald Cigarettes suddenly disappeared from the market . Ben had given Norma prior warning . She had a dozen cases packed carefully in the basement . About a month after she 'd first spoken with Ben , she woke up from a deep sleep jumpy and irritated . When Lenny came by for his morning visit she told him to go away . Her voice was breaking like a fifteen-yearold boy . " Ma , " called Lenny . " Let me in . " She opened the door a crack . " What do you want ? " " Come on , Ma . Do n't get crazy on me . Let me in . I 'm your son , remember ? " . . , . " I know who you are . " She stood back to let him in . " That was a pretty nice station you had on , " he said as he stepped in . " Who was singing ? " " Oh , come on ! " She held up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's written all over your face . What is it ? " " Well , Ma . Your birthday is coming up and all - " He stopped and held out an envelope to her . " Happy birthday . " She opened the envelope and slipped on her reading glasses . They were tickets to Opera Southwest . Two of them . To see Don Giovanni . " You always have music around , " Lenny said shyly . " I thought you might like to go . " Norma did n't say anything for a moment . " Nearly forty years I 've known you , " she said and kissed him on the cheek . " And you can still surprise me . " All the next week , she sang along with everything that came over the radio , tuneless or not . Belted it out with Patsy Cline . Harmonized with a Hunk of Bumin " Love . She was a Werewolf in London Born in America seeing Paradise by the Dashboard Lights for the very first time . Norma was so excited waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times . Just to be sure she would n't have to get up in the middle and go to the bathroom . Lenny wore a tie for the occasion and looked so handsome that Norma decided she 'd forgo cigarettes for the night . Just so he 'd be happy . She left her pack of Reginalds in the dresser drawer just to make sure . The drive downtown , the walk into the Hiland Theater , finding their seats in the middle just in front of the orchestra , passed in a happy , warm blur . She settled back in her chair when the lights dimmed and put one hand on Lenny 's . The music came up . I must have heard this a hundred times , she thought . But now , in front of her , sung by people no less flesh and blood than she , it came to life . In the middle of the second act , where Elvira began her angry solo , Norma leaned forward . For a moment , she had an uncontrollable urge to cough . It subsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it came again . Stronger , this time . She was going have one of those hacking fits like when she coughed up the fleshy bit . She could feel it coming on . Norma had to get out of there . She put one hand over her mouth , stood and walked quickly up the aisle . Lenny stared after her but she was outside in the lobby before he could react . A bathroom . She could n't find one . Instead , she walked outside onto Central Street , thinking to cough or throw up in the gutter . When she filled her lungs , the pain eased and in her mind , she could still hear Elvira 's rage , haunted by the Don and her own weakness . She opened her mouth , and it welled up and out of her like clear running water . The vibrating power of it shook her , made her heart pound and her lungs rejoice . Every day she had listened to the radio , the music had been captured and woven into her cells . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenny was standing in front of her . " Ma ? " he asked . " You okay ? " Norma nodded . She did n't want to speak . " That was good , " he said softly . " Unnatural , of course . But good . " " You think so ? " " Yeah . " He nodded . " I do . " Lenny did n't say anything for a minute . " Tomorrow we go see Dr. Peabody . " " Hush . " She was smiling . Norma felt like a girl again and the world was bright with possibility . She was sixteen , sitting in an old Chevy , smoking and grinning and driving down a road straight as a runway and smooth as a glass table . In 1711 , for his first opera in London , George Handel advertised he would bring to the stage a chariot pulled across the stage by live horses , fireworks , a raft of tenors sailing through the storm in midair and not one , but two fire-breathing dragons . Consequently , opera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ben told Norma she had two advantages going into the audition . One , she was old . It was hard to take a pretty , thirty-year-old diva and make her look seventy-five . Not only was it easier to do the same thing to Norma , she did n't mind and the diva usually did . The second was she had the pipes . Once the director was persuaded to hear her , she had a spot . Not to say she got the front line roles . She was the old dowager , the mother-in-law , the comic innkeeper 's wife , the ancient fortuneteller - in short , any role that suited her age and was n't big enough to make the younger singers want it . This was fine with Norma . She was having a ball . Hey , she thought to herself as she sprayed the inhaler down her throat . Look at me . I 'm the Great Caruso . The next two years passed quickly . Norma expected her voice to have a metal , inhuman quality , given its origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dark warm revelry , " said one critic in Keystone . " Lustrous , " said another in Scottsdale . That was as far as she traveled . Opera Southwest had funding problems those years and their concert tours went only as far east as Amarillo and as far west as Needles . She did n't care . The music never palled . The singing never lost its luster . But one day , she was listening to a recording of Rigoletto as she prepared for the role of Maddalena - being able to read music did n't come with the deal - when she looked up in the mirror . She looked the same . But what was going on inside of her ? The quality of her singing seemed to get better over the last two years . She never coughed anymore . The only reminders she had were the daily dose of the inhaler and the two radiographs she had framed and mounted on her wall . Norma stared at her image in the mirror . She was pushing eighty and could see it in her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have died two years ago . I 'm living on borrowed time . Norma had a feeling deep inside that the mites were only waiting for her . " Waiting for me to do what ? " she asked Ben as she sipped her coffee . It was a warm March and they had come to an outdoor coffee shop near the theater . It was her birthday . " What do you mean ? " Ben leaned back in his chair , bemused . He was still thin by normal standards but in the last few years , he had filled out . Now , his eyes seemed properly proportioned and his mouth fit in his face .. " Are n't you happy ? " " Of course I am . " " Then do n't question it . " Norma snorted and stirred her coffee . " This was the miracle you wanted to be present at ? " Ben smiled back at her serenely . " I 'm present enough . " " These mites went through a lot of effort to do this to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did they stop ? " " The FTV stopped them . " " I do n't believe it .

" Ben closed his eyes in the spring sun . " I 'm not sure intelligence has anything to do with it . " Norma drummed her fingers on the table . " You do n't need intelligence to have a purpose . They had a purpose . What was the word you used ? My singing was an ... emergent property of their purpose . " " What do you think it is ? " " How should I know ? Send messages to the moon ? A voyage to Arcturus ? A better subway ? " Norma mulled it over in her mind . " I owe them for this . " " You do n't owe them a thing . Think of it as a reward for a life well spent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time passing . It was her choice . They had made sure of it . Well , she was eighty now . When should she choose ?

" Ben leaned forward , suddenly alert . " What are you talking about ? " Norma watched the way a bicyclist worked his way down the crowded street . " I quit using the inhaler . " " When ? " " Just now . " It did n't take long . The mites were ready . A month after she stopped using the inhaler she woke up in her bed , too weak to reach the phone . Lenny came by on his way to work to say hi and found her . The paramedics came into her room in slow motion . Their hands left trails in the air as they drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face felt as light as down . It made her smile as she drifted off . She awoke in the hospital , a mask on her face , a crucified Jesus across the room from her .

A moment after she awoke a nurse came in the room and started examining her . Ten minutes later Dr. Peabody entered the room . Dr. Peabody looked as if he 'd been waiting for years to tell her she needed his and only his procedures and therapies . Only his surgery would save her . Norma pulled the mask off her face . " When can I go home ? " she wheezed . Peabody stopped , his mouth open . It was worth the black spots in her vision to see his face . " Miss Carstairs - " " Yes . I 'm dying . I know .

" Let me guess . You did n't want to do what he said . " Norma nodded and lay back , spent . " Get me out of here . I 'll die at home , thank you very much . " Lenny told her she was lucky . Norma 's pneumonia was n't difficult . The pain she expected from lung cancer never materialized . She was spared the emphysemic experience of drowning in her own fluids . There was only a deep and abiding weakness . The lifting of an arm or rolling over in bed became too much effort . Lucky ? She thought so . Lenny moved in . Ben visited daily . Every other day , a home health aide came in and helped bathe her and checked the oxygen . Norma grew accustomed to the oxygen cannula . While it did n't alter the progress of things , it did make them pass more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worked . " You said it was the earth , " she said to Ben , smiling . " The earth speaking through me . " " I changed my mind . This is stupidity given substance , " said Ben , exasperated . " It 's not too late . We can use the FTV . " Lenny was behind him , an anguished look on his face . " Do n't leave me , Mama , " he said softly . " Everything leaves , " she said softly as she drifted off . " Me , too . " Norma drifted over a forest or factory . She could n't quite tell . The world was in furious motion : great trees grew and intertwined with one another , their branches mingling without discernible boundaries . Roads melted into bushes melted into seas . The air was filled with the sound of labor : the percussion of hammers , whistling of saws , voices talking . Spider things were working everywhere but turned their faces up to her as she passed in what could only have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible . A bench grew out of the earth . She floated down to it and rested . It 's all me , she thought , proud of herself . Every little spider , machine , and factory . All me . Enrico Caruso sat down next to her . Not the heavy , ham-fisted Caruso of the old photographs . This was a more handsome and gentler looking , Mario Lanza-esque sort of Caruso . She stared at him . " What ? You 're a ghost now ? " He laughed , a rich vanilla sound . " Hardly . Your brain cells are dying one by one . We thought this the least we could do . " He waved his gentle hands toward the sea . " Nothing here reflects anything like reality , since you 're making it up . But , since you 're making it up , it 's what you want to see . " " Ah , " she said and smiled . The music resolved itself into Verdi 's Il Trovatore . It seemed appropriate . She had no desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enough to listen . " Do you know what 's happening in my room ? " Enrico thought for a moment . " I know what you know . You 've lapsed into a coma . Lenny is telling Ben what you want done with your remains . Ben is resourceful so it will likely be done . " " We 'll sing for them ? " " All across the net . " " Is that what you wanted ? " Enrico shrugged . " It 's enough . How about you ? " She smiled into the evening sun . " It 's enough . " The dusk was coming . She could see the ocean dim into a gauzy purple haze . Like sunset . Like night . Whatever imaginary vision she had possessed was fading . The night darkened as she listened to the music of their work . " You wo n't be here to see it , of course , " Enrico said regretfully as night fell . Norma took his hand in the darkness to reassure him . It was a warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just you wait . You ai n't seen nothing yet . "
