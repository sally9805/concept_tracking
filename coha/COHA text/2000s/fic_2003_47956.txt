The shepherd is perched on a stile , one eye on his paper , one eye on the lane below the ffridd , the meadow , beyond the flock . His dogs lie at his feet , their heads between their paws , panting softly in the unseasonably warm May weather and batting their ears occasionally at the horseflies attracted to the moisture of their eyes . <p> He glances at the front page of the paper , The Caernarvon and Denby , something about the men fighting the fire at Chernobyl , then flips impatiently to a grainy photo on the back page taken at a local sheepdog trial . The picture is part of a weekly competition called Spot the Dog , modeled after the staple newspaper contest , Spot the Ball , in which a photograph of a recent football match is reprinted with the ball airbrushed out . The challenge is to draw an X where the ball should be , based on the positions of the players , their feet , their heads , their eyes . Weather conditions ( blustery , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( soft , heavy , dry ) are given below . In the local version of the game , it 's the sheepdog that has been erased . Somewhere on the photographed hillside there 's an invisible dog . The shepherd studies it for a long moment , reads the caption which describes the direction of the wind ( northeast ) and breed of sheep ( Welsh blacks , although he could have told that from their slightly spiderish gait ) , then finally takes a chewed blue Bic from the top pocket of his coat and makes a neat X , then four more . You get five crosses for sop . He could buy more , but he never does-as much for sporting considerations as reasons of economy . Later he 'll clip the coupon out , mail it in with a check made out for " Fifty pence only . " <p> He glances up for a second , watches a lamb jockeying for position against its mother , before turning back to his paper . He 's been doing the competition since it began seven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's won five times , which is pretty decent , he reckons , even after you deduct all those sop 's a week and a round for the fellows down the pub . Twelve hundred and fifty quid . That 's a tidy sum , even spread over the years , what with a single sheep selling for less than thirty-five . At the pub they thought he was fluky the first two or three times , but now they keep wanting to know if he 's got a system . Forty years of experience is all , he says . That and common sense . Everything happens for a reason , after all , he thinks , even if the reason is unknown . If you know enough about any effect , in this case the movement of a flock , you can always eventually spot the cause , even an invisible dog . <p> Now , he sees a white van come around the shoulder of the hill and weave along the lower lane . The Man from the Ag. , he reckons , getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs trotting through the grass , one ahead of him , one trailing , the same way they work the flock . The last time the Ag . Man was here was to administer a warning . The shepherd had been reported selling a wether to a local butcher . Just the one to tide him over a bad fortnight , it was . But he 'd forgotten the new Ministry of Agriculture rule . " It 's illegal , " the fellow explained , " to transport a single sheep to market these days . It 's considered cruel to the animal to let it travel alone . " <p> The shepherd considered asking if that was true even if you were taking it to be slaughtered , but all he said was that he 'd take two the next time . <p> The Ag . Man shook his head slowly . <p> " The minimum is three , " he explained . " That way if you want to sell one , there are two to travel back to the farm together . " He held up one finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see ? " <p> The shepherd stared at him , until the other said , " I can see my way to letting you off the fine this time , all right ? So long as it does n't happen again . " <p> " Oh , no , " the shepherd said . " I could n't let you do that . " He counted the notes out carefully in Welsh-pum , deg , pymtheg , ugain-and put them in the man 's soft palm . <p> " Twenty , " he explained , as the other wrote out a receipt . <p> At any rate , he has found he rather likes the new rule . He felt a little lonely himself driving back in an empty van . <p> This morning the Man from the Ag. is a boy . He looks like a recent graduate from agricultural college . His wellies are still a glossy green , his cheeks rosy . In the pub the shepherds call these young fellows Herries , meaning city kids who learned their love of the land from James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? If they learned it on a farm of their own , they 'd still be there , would n't they , not sticking their noses in our business . " But beneath the mockery , the shepherd knows , is fear . For serious enough infractions , the Man from the Ag. has the power to ban any of them from owning stock for life . During the last scabies epidemic , farmers had even taken one inspector hostage for a few hours until the Minister himself telephoned them and agreed to replace him . <p> " Bob Bell , " the young man says , and they grip , more than shake , each other 's hands over the bars of the gate . <p> " Nice place , " he says , and the shepherd thanks him . " Had it long ? " <p> " Since my grandfather . " The shepherd leans across the gate , which is made from an old iron bedstead . " This was his marriage bed , " he says . <p> " Really , " Bell says , studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the frame shiver and exhale a thin powder of rust . The dogs twitch at the noise . <p> " His deathbed , too , " the shepherd says dryly . <p> " This them , then ? " Bell says , motioning to the flock , and since the answer is obvious , the shepherd just shrugs . " Any other livestock ? " Bell asks . <p> " Half a dozen chicks , " the shepherd says , pointing to a corrugated-iron henhouse with his rolled-up newspaper . " Family of goats . " <p> " I wo n't need to see the poultry , but I should take a look at those goats . " <p> " That 'll be tricky , you see . They 're wild , is n't it , up on the mountain . " <p> Bell looks puzzled . <p> " To keep an eye on the sheep , " the shepherd says , and when Bell 's expression does n't change goes on . " Goat can get down to a sweet patch of grass on a crag , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be able to get out of a tight spot after . She 'll graze the ledge and then starve there . Goat gets there first , removes the temptation , so to speak . " A blush spreads on the shepherd 's rough face at the end of this speech . He 's embarrassed to have to explain it . <p> " I see , " Bell says , nodding , and after a second , " Righto ! " He heads briskly around the back of his van and opens the rear doors with a squeak . It 's a very clean van , the shepherd sees as he follows , not like his own corroded , straw-lined heap , greasy with lanolin . He uses his knee to push the younger dog 's nose aside . Bell pulls out a couple of aerosol cans and a small black device , like a boxy gun . " Geiger counter , " he says , patting it . " Let 's be having them , eh ? " <p> They walk along the lower edge of the meadow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> " Drystone , " he says . " There 's a dying art . You build them yourself ? " <p> " My father and me . He used to call it a puzzle fitting all the stones together , wedging them right , so 's you would n't need mortar . Like a big jigsaw . " <p> " What about them ? " Bell asks , pointing uphill to a much higher line of wall running along the ridge , encircling the mountain . <p> " Them 's before my time , " the shepherd says . " Medieval . Some say prehistoric . All I do is keep ' em up . " <p> They move through the sheep , the flock spreading open before them as if it 's been unzipped . Bell flicks on the device , waves it around like a magician 's wand , passing it over the rump of each of a dozen or so sheep . It seethes with static , crackling and scratching like an ancient radio , the shepherd thinks . Bell studies the small white dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live thing . He looks up at the shepherd now and then , and once even says , " What was that ? " But the shepherd shakes his head . He has n't said anything . He is standing back , watching the work , but not craning to see the reading on the gauge , until Bell waves him over and shows it to him as he passes it back and forth across one of the broken-mouth ewes . " The safety level is a thousand becquerels , " he says , pointing to a mark in the middle of the counter . The needle strains to the right edge of the scale , and the machine makes a sound of tearing . <p> " Well , Mr.- " <p> " Hughes , " the shepherd says . Then : " Gerry . " Finally : " Gerry Glynllwyn . " Glynllwyn being the name of the farm , and how he is known from the five other Hugheses in the village , the three other Geralds . <p> " Well , Gerry . I regret to inform you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Chernobyl plume , deposited here by precipitation , and are registering unacceptably high levels of radiation . " It sounds as if he 's reading a form . <p> " But they seem fine , " the shepherd says . " They 're not off their feed . I have n't seen anything out of the ordinary . " He realizes he 's tapping his rolled paper against his leg , and jams it in his pocket . <p> " The animals themselves are in no immediate danger , " Bell says . He keeps his eye on the needle . " But I 'll have to restrict their sale and movement . They 're not fit for human consumption . " He waits , but the shepherd seems impassive . " I 've got some paperwork in the van . For you to fill out in case of compensation . " <p> " Maybe the machine is wrong , " the shepherd says . " If we ca n't see anything . " <p> " But the radiation 's invisible , " Bell says , and oddly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause . The shepherd studies the sky for a moment . The worst things that used to come out of it were the low-flying fighter jets from the base nearby , ripping overhead on their training sorties . They 'd put the flock into a panic , sending them rippling over the mountainside like a great white flag . He 'd called the base half a dozen times to tell them to keep clear at lambing time ; in the end he 'd clambered onto the roof of the barn and painted , " Piss off , Biggles , " in letters six feet high . That 'd done the trick . <p> " I can help you with the forms if you like , " Bell is saying . <p> " Thank you . " <p> " But first I have to mark the animals . " He pops the top off the orange aerosol and sprays a bright cross onto the back of the nearest sheep . <p> " So now we can see something , " the shepherd says , over the hissing of the paint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner of speaking , " Bell says , reaching for another sheep . <p> " Give me the other can , and I 'll help , " the shepherd says , holding out his hand , but Bell shakes his head . " Sorry . I have to be the one . Regulations . Besides , the other can is blue . Blue for clear . Orange for restricted . If you could just hold them for me , though ? " <p> It takes them about an hour to move through the whole flock , sheep after sheep . At one point , Bell says that the flock might be able to purge the contaminants if pastured in areas unaffected by the fallout , like the lowlands . " And what do you think I 'd be doing up here if I owned lowland pasture , or could afford to rent it ? " the shepherd asks him . They work in silence after that . Finally , when the last ewe has been shrugged loose , the shepherd follows Bell back to his van . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a form on a clipboard . " You 're registered for nearly eighty . " <p> " There 's a dozen or so stray on the mountain . " <p> A flicker of irritation passes over the man 's face . " You 'll have to call me again when any stragglers come in . And the rest ? " <p> " The rest are gone . It 's been a hard winter or two , and we had a busy fox this spring among the lambs . " <p> " We ? " <p> " Me and the flock , " the shepherd says , smiling crookedly . He is one of five ; a sister dead in infancy , a brother in the war , another of cancer six years ago . His surviving sister is a grandmother in Australia , although he has n't seen her in thirty years . She writes him a card every Christmas . Last year she even called , invited him to visit . " Who knows , " she said gaily , " maybe you 'll fancy retiring here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , her hybrid accent , half-familiar but with an odd twang to it-made him realize how far apart they were . <p> " I 'm sorry . I hope you get him , " Bell says . <p> " Her . It were a vixen . " <p> " I see . " Bell looks down at the clipboard , starts to make checkmarks . <p> The shepherd watches him , turns away to cast an eye over the flock , turns back . He runs a hand down the lapel of his old suit jacket . <p> " Can I ask you what 'll happen ? " he asks carefully . <p> " It 's hard to say . There 'll be regular monitoring . The radioactive agents in the rain are iodine and cesium isotopes . It 's peaty soil hereabouts , as you know , which means the water does n't run off quick . So it gets absorbed by the grass , or the bracken or the heather , along with the contaminants , which are then ingested by the livestock . " <p> " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few scenarios . The radioactive material concentrates in the thyroid of the sheep , which as well as compromising the food chain means a chance of deformed lambs in the future . Then there 's something called a toxic cycle where the radioactive material passed through the sheep 's digestive tract , fertilizes new vegetation which is eaten by the lambs . " <p> " But how long will it all last , like ? " <p> " Well , iodine 131 decays in a matter of days and cesium 134 in around twenty-four months . " Bell blinks . " But cesium 137 has a half-life of around thirty years . " <p> It makes the shepherd think of his grandfather , who used to work in the slate quarry under the mountain , under their very feet , as a young fellow . He was a " danger man . " He used to climb up a long , weaving ladder , sometimes two lashed together , fifty feet into the darkness of the galleries , to chisel loose any slates that might fall from the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipping stars from the sky , " he remembers his grandfather telling him . The slates were dislodged from the ceilings by a steady trickle of water from the mountain above . " Thousand-year-old rain , " the old man called it . " That 's how long it takes to work its way through the rock . " His grandfather had been laid off during the great strike of ' 01 and had never gone back . Blacklisted by management , he 'd used the last of his savings to buy the flock . <p> " You know about cynefin ? " the shepherd asks now . <p> " Come again ? " <p> " Cynefin . I 'm sorry , I do n't know the English for it . It 's the flock 's sense of place . What keeps them on any particular patch of the mountain in the winter . Like an invisible border . It 's what makes it possible to farm up here at all , really . " he begins hesitantly , but then he 's speaking urgently , leaning into Bell . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he 's saying " Kevin " with a stutter . " I might have heard of it . ' Hefted ' is what they call it in the Lakes , I think . " He smiles awkwardly , glances at the knot of sheep over the shepherd 's shoulder . " I always thought it was an old wives ' tale-sheep having memories . " <p> " Not the sheep , really , " the shepherd says , ignoring that smile , making himself tell this , pressing out the words . " It 's the flock , like , that remembers . The ewes teach it to the lambs . Only , if you put a new flock up there , they 'd scatter across four counties . People say it goes back to medieval days when they had enough men to stay with them year-round . Over years and years , generations of sheep learned their ground . " He has his rolled-up newspaper out of his pocket now , brandished , gesturing at the hillside . <p> " I 'm not quite sure what you 're asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . <p> " So if a flock were destroyed or died out , " the shepherd goes on , " the farm 'd be done for , too . " He looks down at his hands and sees how tight he 's been gripping the paper , wringing it until it begins to tear . Bell slowly raises the clipboard between them , and the shepherd realizes the man has no answers . <p> Clouds , he sees dully , are massing above the mountain ; it 's coming on to rain again . <p> " If you 'll just sign here ? " Bell asks gently , and the shepherd takes the clipboard . " You know , " Bell says , after a second . " About your foxes ? There 's some places bringing in a llama , or two . They 're complementary with sheep , and there 's a profitable market for the wool . But there 's also some research that they reduce fox attacks . " He laughs nervously . " Foxes think the llamas are massive sheep , you see . Scares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up from the form for a long moment . <p> " Llamas , is it , " he says , shaking his head . " There 's progress for you . " <p> Bell coughs , and the shepherd 's pen finally scratches over the form . He passes the clipboard back , and Bell tears off a smudged pale-green copy and gives it to him , climbs back into his van . The engine starts first time . <p> " Just do n't forget to mark any strays that come in and give us a call with a revised head count , all right ? " <p> The shepherd nods . <p> He does n't watch the van back out of the lane . Instead , he turns and studies the hillside : the mountain wall , curving away into the low cloud , and below it the flock dotted on the hillside , the crosses on their backs . <p> He thinks of the invisible ones , the rest of the flock that he gathered the day before with the dogs and guided into the disused quarry tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , their white fleeces gray in the dim light , faint as starlight , sifting down the airshafts like dust . He tried to explain it , after all , he thinks . He 'll go to them tonight-already he can hear the weird clacking percussion of loose slate underfoot , see his torch light running over their faces , their slotted eyes flashing back at him like a signal . <p> But first , he thinks , as the drizzle begins to fall , he needs to buy a blue spray can . <p>
