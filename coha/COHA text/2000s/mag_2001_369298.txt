After a struggle of nearly 60 years , a bronze life-size statue of FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT in his wheelchair will be dedicated in Washington by PRESIDENT CLINTON this week . Roosevelt , who never took an unaided step after his polio attack in 1921 , directed the war against the Great Depression and the Axis powers from a wheelchair , but most were not aware of his disability : he obscured it , fearful of electoral disapproval . Only two photographs of him in a wheelchair exist . Red tape and partisan wrangling stymied the memorial until five years ago , but then the arguments within the Roosevelt family and Congress stopped depiction of F.D.R. openly seated in his wheelchair . The National Organization on Disability declared war , pleading that Roosevelt be honestly and proudly shown . With the support of former PRESIDENTS FORD , CARTER and BUSH joining with Clinton  --  and $1.65 million from private citizens  --  sculptor ROBERT GRAHAM fashioned the new figure . On a wall behind F.D.R. are words of wife eleanor : " Franklin 's illness ... gave him the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience and never-ending persistence .
