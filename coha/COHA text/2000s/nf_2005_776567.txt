Tale of Two Farms // Two farms Collapses , past and present Vanished Edens ? A five-point framework Businesses and the environment The comparative method Plan of the book // A few summers ago I visited two dairy farms , Huls Farm and Gardar Farm , which despite being located thousands of miles apart were still remarkably similar in their strengths and vulnerabilities . Both were by far the largest , most prosperous , most technologically advanced farms in their respective districts . In particular , each was centered around a magnificent state-of-the-art barn for sheltering and milking cows . Those structures , both neatly divided into opposite-facing rows of cow stalls , dwarfed all other barns in the district . Both farms let their cows graze outdoors in lush pastures during the summer , produced their own hay to harvest in the late summer for feeding the cows through the winter , and increased their production of summer fodder and winter hay by irrigating their fields . The two farms were similar in area ( a few square miles ) and in barn size , Huls barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 165 cows , respectively ) . The owners of both farms were viewed as leaders of their respective societies . Both owners were deeply religious . Both farms were located in gorgeous natural settings that attract tourists from afar , with backdrops of high snow-capped mountains drained by streams teaming with fish , and sloping down to a famous river ( below Huls Farm ) or 3ord ( below Gardar Farm ) . // Those were the shared strengths of the two farms . As for their shared vulnerabilities , both lay in districts economically marginal for dairying , because their high northern latitudes meant a short summer growing season in which to produce pasture grass and hay . Because the climate was thus suboptimal even in good years , compared to dairy farms at lower latitudes , both farms were susceptible to being harmed by climate change , with drought or cold being the main concerns in the districts of Huls Farm or Gardar Farm respectively . Both districts lay far from population centers to which they could market their products , so that transportation costs and hazards placed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The economies of both farms were hostage to forces beyond their owners ' control , such as the changing affluence and tastes of their customers and neighbors . On a larger scale , the economies of the countries in which both farms lay rose and fell with the waxing and waning of threats from distant enemy societies . // The biggest difference between Huls Farm and Gardar Farm is in their current status . Huls Farm , a family enterprise owned by five siblings and their spouses in the Bitterroot Valley of the western U.S. state of Montana , is currently prospering , while Ravalli County in which Huls Farm lies boasts one of the highest population growth rates of any American county . Tim , Trudy , and Dan Huls , who are among Huls Farm 's owners , personally took me on a tour of their high-tech new barn , and patiently explained to me the attractions and vicissitudes of dairy farming in Montana . It is inconceivable that the United States in general , and Huls Farm in particular , will collapse in the foreseeable future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norse bishop of southwestern Greenland , was abandoned over 500 years ago . Greenland Norse society collapsed completely : its thousands of inhabitants starved to death , were killed in civil unrest or in war against an enemy , or emigrated , until nobody remained alive . While the strongly built stone walls of Gardar barn and nearby Gardar Cathedral are still standing , so that I was able to count the individual cow stalls , there is no owner to tell me today of Gardar 's former attractions and vicissitudes . Yet when Gardar Farm and Norse Greenland were at their peak , their decline seemed as inconceivable as does the decline of Huls Farm and the U.S. today . // Let me make clear : in drawing these parallels between Huls and Gardar Farms , I am not claiming that Huls Farm and American society are doomed to decline . At present , the truth is quite the opposite : Huls Farm is in the process of expanding , its advanced new technology is being studied for adoption by neighboring farms , and the United States is now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming that farms or societies in general are prone to collapse : while some have indeed collapsed like Gardar , others have survived uninterruptedly for thousands of years . Instead , my trips to Huls and Gardar Farms , thousands of miles apart but visited during the same summer , vividly brought home to me the conclusion that even the richest , technologically most advanced societies today face growing environmental and economic problems that should not be underestimated . Many of our problems are broadly similar to those that undermined Gardar Farm and Norse Greenland , and that many other past societies also struggled to solve . Some of those past societies failed ( like the Greenland Norse ) , and others succeeded ( like the Japanese and Tikopians ) . The past offers us a rich database from which we can learn , in order that we may keep on succeeding . // Norse Greenland is just one of many past societies that collapsed or vanished , leaving behind monumental ruins such as those that Shelley imagined in his poem " Ozymandias . " By collapse , I mean a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a considerable area , for an extended time . The phenomenon of collapses is thus an extreme form of several milder types of decline , and it becomes arbitrary to decide how drastic the decline of a society must be before it qualifies to be labeled as a collapse . Some of those milder types of decline include the normal minor rises and falls of fortune , and minor **25;607;TOOLONG restructurings , of any individual society ; one society 's conquest by a close neighbor , or its decline linked to the neighbor 's rise , without change in the total population size or complexity of the whole region ; and the replacement or overthrow of one governing elite by another . By those standards , most people would consider the following past societies to have been famous victims of full-fledged collapses rather than of just minor declines : the Anasazi and Cahokia within the boundaries of the modern U.S. , the Maya cities in Central America , Moche and Tiwanaku societies in South America , Mycenean Greece and Minoan Crete in Europe , Great Zimbabwe in Africa , Angkor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean ( map , pp. 4-5 ) . // The monumental ruins left behind by those past societies hold a romantic fascination for all of us . We marvel at them when as children we first learn of them through pictures . When we grow up , many of us plan vacations in order to experience them at firsthand as tourists . We feel drawn to their often spectacular and haunting beauty , and also to the mysteries that they pose . The scales of the ruins testify to the former wealth and power of their builders-they boast " Look on my works , ye mighty , and despair ! " in Shelley 's words . Yet the builders vanished , abandoning the great structures that they had created at such effort . How could a society that was once so mighty end up collapsing ? What were the fates of its individual citizens ? - did they move away , and ( if so ) why , or did they die there in some unpleasant way ? Lurking behind this romantic mystery is the nagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy society ? Will tourists someday stare mystified at the rusting hulks of New York 's skyscrapers , much as we stare today at the jungle-overgrown ruins of Maya cities ? // It has long been suspected that many of those mysterious abandonments were at least partly triggered by ecological problems : people inadvertently destroying the environmental resources on which their societies depended . This suspicion of unintended ecological suicide-ecocide-has been confirmed by discoveries made in recent decades by archaeologists , climatologists , historians , paleontologists , and palynologists ( pollen scientists ) . The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging their environments fall into eight categories , whose relative importance differs from case to case : deforestation and habitat destruction , soil problems ( erosion , salinization , and soil fertility losses ) , water management problems , overhunting , overfishing , effects of introduced species on native species , human population growth , and increased per-capita impact of people . // Those past collapses tended to follow somewhat similar courses constituting variations on a theme . Population growth forced people to adopt intensified means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terracing ) , and to expand farming from the prime lands first chosen onto more marginal land , in order to feed the growing number of hungry mouths . Unsustainable practices led to environmental damage of one or more of the eight types just listed , resulting in agriculturally marginal lands having to be abandoned again . Consequences for society included food shortages , starvation , wars among too many people fighting for too few resources , and overthrows of governing elites by disillusioned masses . Eventually , population decreased through starvation , war , or disease , and society lost some of the political , economic , and cultural complexity that it had developed at its peak . Writers find it tempting to draw analogies between those trajectories of human societies and the trajectories of individual human lives-to talk of a society 's birth , growth , peak , senescence , and death-and to assume that the long period of senescence that most of us traverse between our peak years and our deaths also applies to societies . But that metaphor proves erroneous for many past societies ( and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching peak numbers and power , and those rapid declines must have come as a surprise and shock to their citizens . In the worst cases of complete collapse , everybody in the society emigrated or died . Obviously , though , this grim trajectory is not one that all past societies followed unvaryingly to completion : different societies collapsed to different degrees and in somewhat different ways , while many societies did n't collapse at all . // The risk of such collapses today is now a matter of increasing concern ; indeed , collapses have already materialized for Somalia , Rwanda , and some other Third World countries . Many people fear that ecocide has now come to overshadow nuclear war and emerging diseases as a threat to global civilization . The environmental problems facing us today include the same eight that undermined past societies , plus four new ones : human-caused climate change , buildup of toxic chemicals in the environment , energy shortages , and full human utilization of the Earth 's photosynthetic capacity . Most of these 12 threats , it is claimed , will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve the problems by then , or the problems will undermine not just Somalia but also First World societies . Much more likely than a doomsday scenario involving human extinction or an apocalyptic collapse of industrial civilization would be " just " a future of significantly lower living standards , chronically higher risks , and the undermining of what we now consider some of our key values . Such a collapse could assume various forms , such as the worldwide spread of diseases or else of wars , triggered ultimately by scarcity of environmental resources . If this reasoning is correct , then our efforts today will determine the state of the world in which the current generation of children and young adults lives out their middle and late years . But the seriousness of these current environmental problems is vigorously debated . Are the risks greatly exaggerated , or conversely are they underestimated ? Does it stand to reason that today 's human population of almost seven billion , with our potent modern technology , is causing our environment to crumble globally at a much more rapid rate than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it crumble locally in the past ? Will modern technology solve our problems , or is it creating new problems faster than it solves old ones ? When we deplete one resource ( e.g. , wood , oil , or ocean fish ) , can we count on being able to substitute some new resource ( e.g. , plastics , wind and solar energy , or farmed fish ) ? // Is n't the rate of human population growth declining , such that we 're already on course for the world 's population to level off at some manageable number of people ? // All of these questions illustrate why those famous collapses of past civilizations have taken on more meaning than just that of a romantic mystery . Perhaps there are some practical lessons that we could learn from all those past collapses . We know that some past societies collapsed while others did n't : what made certain societies especially vulnerable ? What , exactly , were the processes by which past societies committed ecocide ? Why did some past societies fail to see the messes that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in retrospect ) must have been obvious ? Which were the solutions that succeeded in the past ? If we could answer these questions , we might be able to identify which societies are now most at risk , and what measures could best help them , without waiting for more Somalia-like collapses. // But there are also differences between the modern world and its problems , and those past societies and their problems . We should n't be so na ? ve as to think that study of the past will yield simple solutions , directly transferable to our societies today . We differ from past societies in some respects that put us at lower risk than them ; some of those respects often mentioned include our powerful technology ( i.e. , its beneficial effects ) , globalization , modern medicine , and greater knowledge of past societies and of distant modern societies . We also differ from past societies in some respects that put us at greater risk than them : mentioned in that connection are , again , our potent technology ( i.e. , its unintended destructive effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in remote Somalia affects the U.S. and Europe ) , the dependence of millions ( and , soon , billions ) of us on modern medicine for our survival , and our much larger human population . Perhaps we can still learn from the past , but only if we think carefully about its lessons . // Efforts to understand past collapses have had to confront one major controversy and four complications . The controversy involves resistance to the idea that past peoples ( some of them known to be ancestral to peoples currently alive and vocal ) did things that contributed to their own decline . //
