" How do you feel about that ? " Dr. Lusk asked . <br> " I do n't feel much of anything about it , " I answered , dodging the question . <br> " Detective Scully , I wo n't be able to help you if you keep putting up barriers , shielding me from your feelings and emotions . " <br> " It 's her car , okay ? What happens to it is kinda her business , not mine . I was just saying it seemed odd . " <br> " So you booked an appointment through the psychiatric support group and drove all the way over here from Parker Center on your lunch hour , but you do n't have any feelings about the accident ? It just seems odd to you and that 's it ? " <br> " I 'm concerned , okay ? " <br> " Concern is an intellectual response . Your wife crashes her car , does n't tell you about it , drains your bank account to get it fixed on the sly instead of putting it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from you . But despite all this , you have no anger , no sense of frustration or betrayal . You have concern . " <br> " Yeah . " <br> I was thirty minutes into the forty-minute " hour . " Dr. Eric Lusk leaned back in a beige , leather wing chair , peering over tiny half-glasses , his huge Buddha belly , and ten feet of tan Berber . I was in a matching chair opposite him , trapped in a colorless cocoon , trying to affect nonchalance . My body would n't cooperate . Angst smoldered . Telltale emotional exhaust leaked out of me . I crossed my legs , and then uncrossed them while nondescript music oozed from ceiling speakers at subhuman volume . <br> " Let 's talk about the meds you found yesterday . " <br> " I found them in her purse . She 'd peeled the label off the bottle so I would n't know the doctor or what they were for . I had the police lab identify them . The results came back this morning . Carbamazepine and Sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are commonly prescribed for ? " <br> " According to the lab , they 're for seizures . " <br> He nodded . " Has your wife been having seizures ? " <br> " I do n't know . I have n't seen one , but if Alexa was taking this stuff , maybe . She stopped driving her car last week . She gets picked up and brought home by a department driver now . I was hoping she 'd tell me on her own what 's going on . So far she has n't . " <br> " Your wife was abducted last July and suffered a gunshot wound to the head resulting in a severe traumatic brain injury . That was less than eleven months ago . TBI seizures often crop up months afterward and can continue for years . And you say she 's already back at work ? " <br> " She had a lot of stuff pending . It 's a big job . She supervises two hundred people . " <br> " Chief of the Detective 's Bureau at the LAPD . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Yep . " <br> " Who , if I might ask , approved her to return to duty ? " <br> " Alexa went through a battery of physical and psychiatric tests at the Police Academy a month ago . She went to the union . They took up her case and she requalified and was marked fit for duty . " <br> " But you do n't think she is . " <br> I was n't about to answer that one . <br> We sat back and looked at each other . Dr. Lusk slouched in the heavy chair , his huge gut pushing up on his diaphragm , causing him difficulty breathing . His slick complexion shone white as a fish belly . I wondered why I booked this damn appointment and drove all the way over here . <br> " I 'm not a neurologist , Detective Scully , I 'm a psychologist . But I have studied the brain . According to what you told me , your wife Alexa 's TBI affected the frontal and temporal lobes . We generally associate behavioral disorders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional and personality control center . Damage in that area can diminish judgment . It can also cause trouble with concentration and thought organization . Sometimes it leads to an array of more serious behavioral problems such as inappropriate statements , or impulsive or inappropriate actions : social as well as sexual . " <br> " I see . " <br> " Do you ? " <br> " I 'm living with her . Kinda hard to miss stuff like that . " Now he was pissing me off . <br> " So what specific kinds of changes have you witnessed ? " <br> " She used to be organized . Careful and specific . Now she 's all over the place . It 's causing her problems at the department . She 's never been wild or unpredictable before . She knows the ropes and plays by the rules . Alexa is brave and has risked her life in the field many times , but as far as department politics , she 's always been a team player . Now she does n't seem to have any early alert warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consequence . It 's getting her into a pile of trouble with Chief Filosiani . " <br> He nodded and then , without warning , asked , " Has your sex life been affected in any way ? " <br> That was a big one . We 'd only made love two or three times since she came home from the hospital six months ago . At first I 'd thought it was just her headaches and the after-effects of her injury . But now it had become a pattern . We used to make love regularly , but now almost never . I did n't say any of this , afraid to answer . Afraid of what he might tell me . Awkward silence filled the space between us . <br> " Why did you make this appointment if you wo n't discuss any of this with me ? " he said . <br> " I think this was a mistake . " I looked at my watch and saw him smile slightly , as if my little peek down at the dial was a confirmation of some secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the little you 've said I ca n't help you much . Maybe your wife should n't have gone back on the job so soon . If you could get her to stay home , it might lower her stress level and her symptoms might subside . People with brain injuries are often in a race to get back to normality . They want their old life back . They want it to be the way it was before the injury . By putting everything back the way it was , they think they can accomplish this . They ca n't . " <br> " I see . " <br> " No , you do n't . But that 's okay . " <br> " Whatta you mean I do n't ? Where do you get off saying that ? " <br> " Detective Scully , you do n't want to be here . I 've seen guys in the electric chair look more relaxed . The very thought that your wife is having seizures , crashing the car , and whatever else , is abhorrent to you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . " <br> " Then why am I here ? " <br> " Because it 's become unbearable . Your wife has changed . She 's become reckless and unpredictable . That behavior was previously reserved for you . Now you 're experiencing a major role-reversal in your marriage . It 's suddenly become your job to contain her mistakes instead of vice versa . You do n't like it . It 's limiting the way you behave , impinging on your own sense of self . " <br> " You got all that in just thirty-five minutes ? Not bad . " Trying to back him off , because he 'd pretty much just nailed it . <br> " You know that you both need help . She wo n't come in and talk to me , so you did . You 're looking for a quick fix , but I ca n't possibly treat your wife through you . " <br> " I see . " <br> " You keep saying that . Pardon my bluntness , but you do n't see . You do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial . " <br> We stared at each other , locked in his beige-on-beige , forty-minute time capsule . <br> " Will she get better ? " I finally asked . <br> " Recovery from traumatic or acquired brain injury can take years . A patient will sometimes experience mood changes , major shifts in behavior parameters , even temper control problems . Sometimes these changes will only be temporary and the patient will return to normal , other times not . I 'd have to have many sessions with your wife to determine what , if any , of these things are present and how permanent they might become . The meds you found in her purse indicate she 's having seizures . Maybe that 's what caused the traffic accident . " <br> " She wo n't book an appointment with a psychiatrist . She has a neurosurgeon in Westwood , Luther Lexington . He did her surgeries and he recommended a psychiatrist last summer . She only went to that doctor once and never went back . " <br> " A mistake . " <br> " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaus in the city . If it gets out she 's going to a shrink or having seizures , crashing her car , or whatever , it 's going to destroy her career . " <br> " I 'm hesitant to make a diagnosis not having seen the patient . But I will tell you this much . I do n't like what I 'm hearing . If I were you , I would get her help regardless of the danger to her career . " <br> I looked at my watch again . <br> " If you have someplace to go , do n't let me keep you . " Somehow he managed the sentence without sounding snotty . <br> " I 'd have been better off going to McDonald 's . At least I would have gotten lunch . " <br> " Then I wo n't charge you for the hour . " <br> " No . I want to pay . I want . . . I want to come back next week . " <br> " Why ? " <br> " I do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay . " <br> I stood , accidentally hitting the little table with a Kleenex box next to the chair and tipping it over . Another slight smile . I righted the table and replaced the tissue box . <br> " Well , I guess that does it then , " I said . <br> " That does it , " he replied , wheezing it at me through tiny teeth buried in a fleshy smile . His chubby hands were laced across his belly . He had no intention of standing to see me out . <br> I turned and walked to the door . <br> " Detective ? " I stopped and looked back at him . " People change . Even people who did n't get shot in the head . Change is an inevitable part of life . Sometimes by embracing change , it becomes less frightening and we open ourselves to the good that may be hiding there . " <br> " I see . " <br> The smile flickered again . Then he said , " Here 's something you can do . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , write it down . To be valuable , it should be mostly about what you feel . <br> " Okay . " <br> " Next week , then . " <br> It was the first day of summer , but I stepped outside into an unseasonable Alaskan cold front , which had roared out of the north , blasting Los Angeles . A frigid wind whipped down the mountain passes , into the Valley . Even though it was June , it felt like November . The palm trees that lined Van Nuys Boulevard creaked and bent , swaying like gaunt old men in the brisk wind , leaning over to peer down as I wandered in confusion toward my car . <br> Copyright 2008 by Stephen J.
