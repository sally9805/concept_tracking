Doctors have long known that cutting back on salt or sodium can help lower blood pressure in folks with hypertension , a silent condition that increases the risk of heart attack and stroke . What has n't been so clear is whether reducing the amount of sodium in the diet will benefit those whose blood pressure is normal . Now comes word that restricting salt can indeed lower normal blood-pressure levels . Though the effect is n't as great , it 's still important , according to a study published in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine . <P> The decrease in blood pressure occurred regardless of race or gender and whether or not study participants ate a " typical American diet , " which is high in saturated fats and skimps on fruits and vegetables , or the so-called DASH ( for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ) diet , which emphasizes lots of fresh produce , low-fat dairy , fish and fewer sweets and which was proved in 1997 to reduce hypertension . The biggest decreases in blood pressure in this study were recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sodium intake to 1,200 mg a day . <P> Why is this significant ? Public-health experts estimate that Americans consume , on average , about 3,500 mg of sodium  --  equal to about 9 grams of salt  --  each day . Current guidelines recommend consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium  --  about 6 grams of salt  --  daily . It 's not that we 're that heavy-handed with the saltshaker . Most of our dietary sodium is added during food processing . To get down to 1,200 mg , you 'd have to forgo most prepared foods , take-out deliveries and restaurant meals . <P> As someone who periodically comes home late from work too pooped to do anything but dial up some sodium-packed Thai food , I know that eating home-cooked meals all the time is not terribly practical . But with a little planning and some self-awareness , you can work around those occasional slips . Salt is , after all , essential to life . The trick is to adopt an overall pattern of healthy living and not depend on any one thing to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much salt you 're eating , but do n't forget to make fruits , vegetables and whole grains a larger part of your diet . They 'll help lower your cholesterol levels as well as your blood pressure . Be sure to drink alcohol moderately , if at all . Losing weight  --  even just 10 lbs .  --  and exercising at least 30 minutes most days of the week can also have a marked effect on blood pressure . <P> Folks with kidney problems should check with their doctor before cutting back on salt . If you do decide to cut down on salt , do it gradually to give your taste buds time to adjust . Try substituting lemon , parsley , pepper or oregano for salt . <P> Check food labels . Pasta sauces , sandwich breads and frozen dinners often contain lots of sodium . <P> And remember , even if you do n't have to worry about this now , you probably will eventually . Half of U.S. adults have a blood pressure of at least 120/80 mm Hg , which is at the high end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases with age . " We ca n't put everyone on drug therapy , " says Dr. Frank Sacks of the Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston and the chairman of the DASH-sodium study . But everyone can try to do with a dash less salt . <P> For more on salt and hypertension , visit
