At a writers " conference in New Mexico , your editor met a poet whose first response to the words " science fiction " was to say , " The thing of it is , either they come to us or we go to them . " ( Perhaps this poet greets mystery writers by saying , " Either the villains get away or the cops get " em . " ? ) We have n't run many alien invasion stories recently , but Mr. Sheckley 's take on the subject seems like a fresh one . What would the aforementioned poet make of it ? More to the point , what do you think ? <p> EARTH CB122XA IS ONE OF the alternate Earths spilling out of the matrix of quantum mechanical points of possibility that make up this part of the multiverse . They do things differently here . Earth CB122XA , or " Earth , " as the locals called it , was a quiet place . A single king ruled the entire planet . It had its cyclones , floods , forest fires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Earths . But these came in moderation , especially when compared with elsewhere . And , just as their people and planets and conditions of Earth came out of the cosmic foam , so did their gods . This Earth had its own god , generated out of the endless quantum-mechanical possibilities . The locals called him " God . " He did n't involve himself in the day-to-day workings of the planet or its people . He preferred not to work miracles , considering them a cheap effect . This god liked to see his people work out things for themselves . But sometimes , when an important point was at issue , or when the life ofthe entire planet hung in the balance , he had been known to give a hint or two . This Earth , like all the others , was prone to accidents . Accidents often have forewarnings , but this one had none , unless you count the two spaceships that appeared seemingly from out of nowhere , circled the planet as though they were doing a survey , and then vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fairly advanced technological civilization , had no spaceships to send up to find out what the strangers wanted . There was some speculation as to why they had not responded to Earth 's signals , but not much , because only a few people had seen them , and their accounts were not generally believed . All too soon , the ships were back , and they led a fleet of spaceships into the skies of Earth . These ships were large and fully armed , and the people of Earth did not try to oppose them , but waited to see what they would do . To wait was also the decision of Drax , the king of Earth at that time . The spaceships took up position above Earth 's capital city , which was a place of architectural merit with many green spaces . At last a single huge ship came down and landed on the lawn of the king 's palace . Drax said to his court officials , " I guess I 'd better see what they want . " He walked out alone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceship opened . A group of men marched out . They were tall , broad , ferocious-looking men , wearing battle armor . After them came a single man , larger than the others , dressed in golden armor . He was taller than his guards by half a head , and proportionately broader . He carried his massive golden armor lightly . He wore metal belts from which hung an assortment of weapons , each more terrifying-looking than the one before . In one hand he carried a mace with a massy head , around which were mounted razor-sharp blades . King Drax walked up to him and bowed . The golden warrior inclined his head slightly . They sized one another up for a moment . At last the alien leader spoke . " I am Eduardo . I am the king of this several-million-man army that I have brought to your planet . " " And I am Drax , " Drax said . " I am the king of this planet we call Earth . I welcome you . I am amazed to hear you speak our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few things we have retained from our planet 's old science . It enables us to give orders to our subject people without having to sully our mouths with their debased languages . " " It 's obviously a useful accomplishment , " Drax said . " Have you many subject people ? " " Every race we have encountered is now subject to us . Except for the few who preferred to die to the last man . " " Our god would not approve of that , " said Drax . " He is not in favor of war . He advises us to go on living by any means possible , and at any price . " " He sounds like a wise god . Let 's get down to business . How do you feel about fighting me here and now in single combat for the whole works ? " His gesture seemed to encompass the entire Earth . Drax looked at the armed man more than twice his size and smiled . " I 'd rather not , " he said . Eduardo nodded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about if my army fights yours ? " " We have n't fought a war in over a thousand years , " said Drax . " I do n't think we 'd make a very good showing . Have you another alternative ? " Eduardo looked him up and down and said , " If you think being unarmed and insignificant is going to keep me from killing you , you are mistaken . " " Why should there be any killing at all ? " asked Drax . " It 's usual , " Eduardo said , " when one king wants to take over the territory of another king . " " Do you really want to be king of this planet so badly that you 'd kill for it ? Do n't bother . The planet 's yours . " " This is anticlimactic , " said Eduardo . " We 're accustomed to at least token resistance . " " You wo n't find it here , " Drax said . " You 're going to rule this planet no matter what I say or do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " Eduardo said . He had seen total capitulation before . " The first thing I 'll need is a palace . I have to change my armor , issue some orders , put up my guard , and get some lunch . " " My palace is yours , " Drax said . " I 'll move into a hotel in town . " " You 're pretty cool about all this , " Eduardo said . " I 've got a notion to kill you right here and now , and rid myself of your deviousness . " " You 'll do as you wish , " Drax said . " But I assure you , I 'm not devious . My god tells me the new king must be served . I obey . I would be useful to you in getting your orders transmitted to my people and obeyed properly . " " My dear fellow , why should I trust you ? " " Because I will always be under your eyes and in your hands . If I displease you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's true , " Eduardo said . " Okay . I 'll need to go to my palace and get out a few orders . " " My palace is your palace , " Drax said . King Eduardo had a lot of work to do . He got all his soldiers places to live . This took several days . After those chores were done , Eduardo called for Drax and said , " Okay , now what ? " " Your majesty has been working very hard , " Drax said . " Might it not be time for a little entertainment ? " " You know , Drax , I 've never met anyone like you . Other kings , when I come to take over their planet , fight me to their last man . That 's noble . I applaud noble men like that . But what do you do ? You turn over everything to me without a fight . Why are you doing this , Drax ? " " This is what my god has instructed me to do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give in without a struggle , and to hand over what you are asked for . " " Our god has served us well , " Drax said . " Well , I think it 's time we got some girls in here . " " As you wish , " Drax said . " They 'll start arriving by tomorrow . " " I 'll want all the finest looking women in the kingdom . " " You 'll get them . " " And let your wife be among them . " After a short silence , Drax said , " It shall be as you say . " Eduardo sneered at him . " You really are a weak son of a bitch ! " " What would you do if I said you could n't have her ? " " Kill you and take her anyway . " " Take her anyway , but do n't kill me . " " So you can live to fight another day ? " " So I can live . " " And I believe you have two nubile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll have them , too . They 'll be serving girls at our feasts . " Drax turned pale , but he nodded . " Yours is the power to take what you want . " AND SO THE FEASTS and the merrymaking began among the invaders . Eduardo 's troops were quartered in every city of any size on the planet . Eduardo decreed month-long celebrations , and the most beautiful women were forced to attend . The invaders were in a very good mood . They considered this a time of national degradation for Drax 's people , and this pleased them . Eduardo 's next decision was to consider the people of Earth a population of untouchables - except that they were very touchable by the overclass . The Earth people were ordered to refer to themselves as The Underclass . The invaders thought that was very funny , and ignoble in the extreme . Eduardo was amazed that Drax could bring himself to accept this . He asked him , " How can you bear such an insult ? " " My god told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The king and his people quickly got used to bowing and scraping before Eduardo and his warriors . It was a big change but they handled it with little difficulty . The invaders tasted the pleasures of the Earth and found them good . They quickly accustomed themselves to the soft and delicious foods that the underclass prepared so well . They grew used to exquisite women , which the Earth had so bounteously . And to the exquisite boys , for those whose tastes ran that way . They grew to love the great wines of Earth . And then they learned about the great drugs . This Earth was exceptionally well-stocked with drugs . And they were all stored in the temples that abounded on every continent , and proliferated in every city . In the culture of Earth , drugs were used only as gifts to the gods . Consequently great quantities of them had piled up in the temple storerooms , neatly labeled , wrapped , or bagged or barreled . Ready to go . There was ancient hashish that had mellowed and intensified for months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all of the subtle preparations of the opium poppy . There were marijuanas so potent that the mere nimbus of their scent was enough to intoxicate a man . Eduardo was in a high good old spirit when he asked Drax to visit him again , this time in his private chamber , which once had been Drax 's private chamber . There was the carved green jade vase , the antique red turkey rug , and the yellow damask couch on which Drax and his wife had reclined in happier days . But it was too painful to think about . Drax put it out of his mind , remembering one of his god 's more resonant sayings : " How easy it is for bad memories to come upon a person unawares . To forget such memories is difficult , but one who is assiduous toward his own salvation will acquire the knack , if for no other reason than to maintain his present happiness . " Eduardo appeared in good spirits ; his sallow cheeks were flushed , and a hectic light was burning in his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eduardo called out , " you see me in an elevated mood . Life is good , my dear ex-king . " " I agree , and my god agrees , too . " " I think I know what you 're trying to do , you sly dog . You expect me and my men to besot ourselves with your drugs , then you will rise up in rebellion against us , and cut all our throats . " Here Eduardo laughed very loudly . " We considered it , of course , " Drax said . " But rejected the idea immediately . It would never have worked . There are millions of you invaders on our planet . If we killed you all , we would pollute our Earth with your bodies . Our god would never have stood for it . " " So what would he have done , this god of yours ? " " If we polluted his Earth ? He would have slain us . " " So how come he does n't kill us invaders , who conquered his people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my god 's thoughts , much less his decisions . But since he is a thorough sort of deity , he doubtless has plans for you invaders . " " And what would they be ? " " I have n't the slightest idea . " It was a short interview , and apparently unsatisfactory to Eduardo , who waved Drax away . The conqueror remained sitting , his chin upon his hand . A few weeks later , Eduardo again called for Drax . " I know your plan ! It is the drugs , is n't it ? You thought we would become stupid and careless with them . But such is not the case . I am smarter than ever , and my men are doing fine . " " I had no such thought , " Drax said . " I have always believed the supposed drawbacks of drugs are greatly exaggerated . " " But you do not use them yourself ? " " Our god forbids them to us . " " And when did that begin ? " " The taboo began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interesting .... Well , just as well . The stuff 's too good for the underclass . " Drax bowed his head in the servile manner he was growing accustomed to . " But the reason I asked to see you , my men have been reporting that their local temples are almost empty of drugs . " " Not even the greatest pile is inexhaustible . " " We want you and your people to give us more . " " There is no more . " " Then have your people get out there and grow some . " " We tried that , to no avail . No narcotic plant has grown on our planet since your arrival . " " And you attribute this to your god ? " " I suspect it 's his way of doing things . " " People like me and my men are not going to be conquered by a lack of narcotics ! " Drax cringed and nodded . Eduardo remained sitting on the couch , his eyes fixed on nothingness . Drax noticed that Eduardo 's hands were trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drax retired . Nothing changed , life went on , but suddenly , everything changed . Earth historians have theorized that the conquerors had been buoyed up by their own exploits , and by the drugs that made them feel good , better , best . Suddenly all that was no more , and now there was an almost palpable gloom hanging over the invaders . The Earth and its peoples lived on quietly under their overlordship . Grain , vegetables , animals , fish , all flourished . All plants grew , except for the narcotic-producing ones . Life was quiet , and very tame . There were no new lands to conquer . Not on this planet at any rate . And so , very suddenly , in one of those vagaries that are the bewilderment of learned men everywhere , the marauders voted en masse to pack up and move on to the next world , fresh glory , more conquests , and the next drug . And Eduardo , who was as good a politician as he was a warrior , had no choice but to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to his spaceship , the last to take to the skies . At the gangplank , Drax said , " Pleasant voyage , king , and great deeds ahead of you . " Eduardo looked sour . He said to Drax , " I do n't know what you or your god did , but you tricked us . I 'm sure of it . I still do n't know why all my men want to leave this place . It 's something you did . I really ought to kill you before I go . " But Drax had an answer . He said , " If you did that , who would see to raising your statue , building your temple , and clearing the sacred grounds ? Who else but I would prepare things so my people could worship you as a god ? " " I had n't thought of that , " Eduardo said . He looked a little more cheerful . " I am a god . I fought your god and won . Put that on the statue ! " " The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our god says , " He who laughs last laughs best . " Have a nice new conquest , Eduardo . But remember , while you were here on Earth , you merely occupied territory for a while . That 's not the same as winning . "
