<p> " ... every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm , together with ammunition therefor . " EXCERPT FROM 1982 KENNESAW ORDINANCE , SEC. 34-1 <p> John Nunez and his family moved to Kennesaw from New Jersey nine months ago . <p> Friends and relatives rib the sales manager about whether he 's complied with the city 's famous ordinance . Does he own a gun ? <p> " No , " he said . " Does a water pistol count ? " <p> It 's not a matter of philosophy , Nunez said . He likes handguns . But he has three kids in the house under the age of 5 . <p> The gun law heard ' round the world has entered its 20th year . It still reads the same : The head of every household in Kennesaw must have a firearm and ammunition . <p> Unless he or she does n't want to . <p> But little else has stood still . The little town of 7,000 has exploded into a city of 22,000 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly vanished . <p> The police chief who was assigned the task of explaining the law  --  and coping with the international army of journalists who stormed the railroad town in its wake  --  is now a writer of mystery novels in Nebraska . <p> Dent Myers , a self-described racist and unreconstructed Confederate , made a second career from the gun law , posing in front of his downtown shop with the .45-caliber pistols he keeps strapped to his hips . <p> He turned 70 in January . A cellphone has joined the holsters , and Myers can feel the ground shifting beneath him . " There ai n't no old Kennesaw left , " he said . <p> The gun law retains a powerful local constituency that views the ordinance as a mission statement for the preservation of the Second Amendment . And the outside world remains fascinated : Not long ago , Leonard Church , the current mayor , got a phone call from an Australian radio station . <p> " The gun law rarely comes up as anything other than a novelty anymore , " said Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . " I think at this point , it 's served its purpose . " <p> Does he own a gun ? Yes . It 's an 1851 Navy revolver , a .44 caliber . " It takes seven to eight minutes to load and is good to 25 feet or so , " he said . <p> The shooting of President Ronald Reagan and two others in March 1981 marked the beginning of the modern anti-handgun movement . Four months later , the village of Morton Grove , Ill. , a northern suburb of Chicago , became the first municipality in the country to ban the ownership , sale and possession of handguns . <p> Birch Society ties <p> But in much of Cobb County , which at that time still had vast rural tracts , the politics of the hard right were still ascendant . The county was part of U.S. Rep. Larry McDonald 's 7th District . <p> McDonald was an influential member of the anti-Communist John Birch Society  --  he would be named chairman in 1983 , just before he died  --  and a supporter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a John Bircher and shared McDonald 's distaste for gun control . " Darvin was a great hunter , " recalled Fred Bentley Sr. , then the city attorney . " He loved to hunt . He enjoyed firearms . Everyone on the council at that time loved to hunt . " <p> For nine months , Purdy stewed over the Morton Grove handgun ban . Then he called Bentley and asked him to draft a counter-ordinance . <p> " I recommended to them that they not adopt it because I did n't see any way to make it constitutional , " said Bentley , now 74 . <p> But pass it the City Council did , at a regular Monday night meeting in March 1982 . The news reached around the world in a matter of hours . <p> That Tuesday morning , Myers , owner of Wildman 's Civil War Surplus and Herb Shop , celebrated by donning a third pistol for the journalists who invaded the sleepy town . ( The story in that morning 's Atlanta Constitution had to explain approximately where Kennesaw was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Chief Robert Ruble the official spokesman on the issue . " Darvin just sat back and smiled , " Ruble said . " But for at least a year , I had no time to myself . " The result was a national debate on gun control that would reach a crescendo that summer with an appearance by Purdy and the mayor of Morton Grove on " The Phil Donahue Show "  --  then the most popular program on daytime TV . <p> As written , the Kennesaw ordinance exempted felons , the physically disabled and those who opposed gun ownership on religious grounds . <p> Local citizens , as well as journalists , began asking how the new law would be enforced . Two citizens filed a federal lawsuit challenging its constitutionality . <p> Bentley , the attorney , eventually tickled the language to increase the exemptions . <p> On June 1 , 1982 , a revised ordinance formally took effect . Gun possession was the law in Kennesaw , unless you could n't afford it or you objected for any reason , religious or otherwise . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who agreed with it , " said Richard Butler , one of those who filed suit . <p> A federal magistrate threw out the legal challenge . The ACLU , which was backing the action , declined to pursue . <p> Butler is now 67 and still has a TV repair shop off Main Street . And no , he still does n't own a gun . <p> Low crime rate <p> City officials have steadfastly credited the gun ordinance with a decline in crime . <p> Mayor Church points out 1998 statistics that show Kennesaw 's violent crime rate is one-fifth the state of Georgia 's , and its burglary rate is one-fourth . <p> The inquiries from journalists and newcomers continue , to the point that a new Web site for the city , expected to be up by Aug. 1 , will contain a direct link to the two-paragraph ordinance . <p> " Nobody every figured it would go this far , " said Church , 53 . The mayor , who runs a dental lab , is a passionate defender of the ordinance . He owns several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment of her car . " I have to obey the law , " he said . <p> But Church also realizes his city is in search of a broader identity . When approached for a photograph , he made sure he would n't be asked to pose with a gun . <p> Fred Bentley Sr. is no longer the city attorney . Fred Bentley Jr . is . <p> But Bentley Sr. thinks the gun law 's lasting legacy may have nothing to do with politics or crime . <p> The real effect of the gun law was to raise Kennesaw 's profile just as a wave of tremendous growth hit Cobb County . Bentley thinks the ordinance put Kennesaw at the top of that tsunami . <p> " Business owners are conservative , " he said . " They want a conservative town . " <p> Shortly after the ordinance was approved , City Councilman J.O . Stephenson said City Hall was approached by three landowners who wanted to make sure their project was annexed into the city . <p> The development turned out to be Legacy Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's one of the largest planned communities in metro Atlanta . <p> If the gun law spurred that kind of growth , then the gun law is at least partly responsible for changing Kennesaw 's character . <p> The city 's biggest project now is a $5 million rehabilitation of its downtown . The idea is to make the city center a destination for shoppers and diners . <p> But planners say it is tough to lure a broad range of establishments to downtown Kennesaw when its most prominent business is a store dedicated to white supremacy . <p> Ex-mayor disappears <p> Dent Myer 's shop snakes through a two-story , 90-year-old building on downtown 's north end , virtually unchanged over two decades . Inside is a range of authentic Civil War memorabilia , and even more authentic race-oriented material . <p> Myers compares modern Kennesaw to a wad of gum left on the bedpost overnight . " It 's lost its flavor , " he said . Downtown traffic is so heavy that sometimes he ca n't pull his ' 76 AMC Pacer out of its parking space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Everybody 's going to flush their toilet at once one day , and Allatoona will go dry . " <p> There is no greater mystery surrounding the Kennesaw gun law than that of Mayor Purdy . <p> With the momentum of the gun law behind him , Purdy ran unopposed for a third term in 1983 , but chose not to run again in 1985 . A year later , at age 42 , he suffered a stroke . " I could n't walk , I could n't talk , " he told a reporter a year later . <p> One day in 1990 , Purdy disappeared , leaving behind two children , an 8-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son , according to court papers . <p> His wife of 15 years reported him to police as a missing person . She divorced him 18 months later , in absentia . <p> Ruble , then police chief , said he never picked up hints of trouble in Purdy 's personal life . " Other than the gun law , he was pretty straight-laced , " Ruble said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad language . " <p> As for Ruble , now 68 , he left Kennesaw and his $23,000-a-year job in 1985 . After a couple of high-end jobs in corporate security , Ruble retired to Central City , Neb. ( population 2,700 ) . " Nobody knows what the gun law is , " he said . <p> He has n't been back to Kennesaw since he left , but he hoped to make it a part of his book tour . The first of four novels he 's written , " Have No Mercy , " is just hitting the stores . A plot synopsis is on his Web site , www.bobbyruble.com . It 's not about the South , or the gun law . <p> Ruble enjoys his quiet and the anonymity . But he thinks the gun ordinance was worthwhile and effective . <p> " To me , it worked , " he said . " It was psychological , but it worked . " Dent " Wildman " Myers , 70 , owner of Wildman 's Civil War Surplus , made a second career from the Kennesaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb County town .
