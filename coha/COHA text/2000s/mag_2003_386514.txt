Section : you may be right LETTERS <p> I MUST ADMIT I WAS A MIFFED AT THE RESPONSES TO Bishop Kevin Dowling 's November Sounding Board ( " Let 's not condemn condoms in the fight against AIDS " ) that were so quick to condemn women like Lydia  --  women in Africa who have no family and no support system . They can lie down and die or go into prostitution . That 's real life . I wish it were n't , but it is . <p> The other thing that Dowling did n't mention is this : Many women in Central and South America as well as in Africa who are married have to worry about getting HIV/AIDS from their husbands . They work away from home for long lengths of time and use prostitutes who could very well be infected . These are moral women trying to stay alive . <p> We in the United States have no idea what it is to live day to day in sub-Saharan Africa , in Guatemala , in the barrios of Brazil . Bishop Dowling knows  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do well to listen with open ears to their questions about how to fight AIDS in countries where way too many are dying . We have a lot to answer for if we continue to remain self-righteous . Joan M. Brausch Midland , Mich . <p> <p> There is something I do not understand in the debate about whether the Catholic Church should permit the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS . Obviously , most of the people who are affected have already rejected the church 's teaching on sexual morality . Those in danger of AIDS for whom a condom would be useful are already engaging in casual or promiscuous sex . Why would they be interested in whether the church permits condoms ? <p> The church does not permit fornication and adultery . Are there really people who ignore the church 's teaching on chastity and purity but would think using a condom is a sin because the church teaches this ? Do they need permission to use a condom in order to have illicit sex safely ? What am I missing here ? Bernadette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tara Dix raises some interesting points and several new questions in her Glad You Asked ( " What 's the difference between All Saints and All Souls ? " November ) . If only man lives " in time , " and once we have departed our mortal body there is " no time , " how is it that you can justify purgatory as a place ? Even the Catechism of the Catholic Church describes purgatory as a process not a place . Of course , this raises additional questions , too , like if purgatory is a process existing outside of time , why does the church still teach indulgences ? Jim Johnson Grapevine , Texas <p> In praise of protesting <p> It seems that Dan Andriacco in his October Sounding Board ( " Thou dost protest too much ! " ) is uncomfortable by the constant presence of protesters who refuse to put down their signs and go home . Good . That 's exactly why protest should remain in the public domain : to undermine the complacency of those who would rather not make themselves vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enough to effect change . Still , it is disheartening to be told yet once again that it is the protesters who are creating the problem of divisiveness in this country . The problem is not that protesters keep insisting that war is n't the answer ; the problem is that our present administration has not and will not consider ( except in lip service ) asking questions of itself or of us in regards to the possibilities of peaceful resolutions . <p> My experience of protesting is n't about feeling good . In fact , I find the experience very often distressing . Being flipped off , yelled at , and mooned by passing drivers ; being accused by strangers of being in league with al-Qaeda , and being singled out by the popular press as the reason why our present administration 's efforts in Iraq are n't working does n't make me feel good . And yet , when I become discouraged I remember that Jesus suffered the same humiliations and degradations to deliver the Good News . <p> Would Jesus carry a picket sign ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped going public with his message just because it made people feel uncomfortable or brought division among those who knew him . <p> He retreated periodically to pray , as we all must and should , but he always returned to lead the people toward a radical change in their lives . <p> Jesus suffered criticism . He suffered attacks on his choices and on his character ; his " agenda " was always suspect to those who did n't want to change . And he suffered a public execution for us . So in light of Jesus ' example , how can I stop carrying my peace sign into public places ? It 's the least I can do . Leonora Rianda Albany , Ore . <p> <p> I found a lot to agree with in Andriacco 's Sounding Board . Protests can be divisive , and there are other ways to witness for peace . But , unreformed protester that I am , I also found a few things to protest . <p> When hundred of thousands ( not merely thousands , Dan ) protested the war in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We gave each other the support and energy we needed to continue our peacemaking efforts , and we undoubtedly gave at least some of our leaders the support they needed to keep speaking out against the war . Sometimes supporting your friends is just as important as trying to change your opponents . <p> I feel compelled to point out one other inaccuracy in the article : " We do all get a vote . " Those of us who live in our nation 's capital do not get a vote in Congress . We must find other ways to send messages . I 'll keep protesting ( peacefully ) in addition to ( not instead of ) using the other methods that Andriacco suggests . Jean Sammon Washington , D.C. <p> God walks with me <p> Sue Fox McGovern 's article " Cry aloud to God " ( October ) hit home . God truly does reach out to us in any way he can . My father is in the last days of his 26-year war with Parkinson 's . I can say that I thought that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom called to say that Dad is failing , my world came crashing down on me . So I started to plan his funeral Mass . <p> Suddenly I no longer saw a man filled with pain but one who had a heart that would not or could not stop loving even when Parkinson 's took his voice . Right now I am at a loss , but I have found strength in helping my mother plan Dad 's Mass . I wanted people to know my father before this disease took him from us . <p> But it is I who found my father again . I no longer see the Parkinson 's but my father 's smile , his laugh , and how he said so much with his eyes . God heard my cry and comforted me . I know that he will be there at every step and will wait with me as I work through each one . Barbara L. Partyka Chicago , Ill . <p> A friend indeed <p> I was encouraged by Evelyn Bence 's article " Pass It On " ( October ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends who are grieving . We think we do n't know them well enough ; someone else , we say , must be closer to the family than we . We give ourselves similar excuses . <p> But Bence took a chance of barging in and wound up being just the right person to help a woman whom she hardly knew . And she related the event so the rest of us could learn and be inspired . Emilie Griffin Alexandria , La . <p>
