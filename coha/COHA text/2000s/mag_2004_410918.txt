What makes a woman stylish today ? Catherine Wilson argues that it is all about wearing the unexpected // Stella McCartney is of the opinion that what makes a woman stylish today is a defiant spirit and individuality . " The one rule is that there are no rules , " she says . Fearless about her own sense of style , McCartney wears whatever she feels like . I have had breakfast with her in London when she has been wearing a willful combination of a shrunken pink sweater , jeans and stilettos , with large diamonds in her ears and a tweed trilby set atop her head at a raffish angle . A brave and modern mix at 9 A.M. , and one that looked effortless and fabulous . The way McCartney puts herself together has nothing to do with sartorial diktats-and everything to do with the unexpected . " The moment you start thinking about rules , " she says , " you are in trouble . " To even think about rules these days is unthinkable . Take Charlotte Stockdale , a stylist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears a cocktail dress to a drinks party-she would rather throw on " baggy trousers and a really amazing belt . " Or the unconventional Miuccia Prada , who also likes to wear her diamonds during the day ( a no-no not so long ago ) and a vintage necklace back-to-front , so that the gemstones touch her skin , displaying the intriguing craftsmanship of their setting . To the question why , she replies simply , " Because it is a private pleasure . " Another woman often cited for her idiosyncratic style is the Danish beauty Helena Christensen . Recently , she was getting ready for an awards ceremony when she decided to go the unexpected route . " I was bored by all the dresses , " she says . " Suddenly I put on a cardigan , looked at myself in the mirror and decided to just wear it with tights and high heels . People were quite shocked , but afterward Sophie Dahl came up to me and said , " That is the coolest look I have ever seen . ' ' " As Alber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now at Lanvin , sums it up : " It is best not to have rules for the way your clothes should look . It is not cool anymore . " There was a time , however , when a lady 's life was governed by a code of dressing . Gloves and a hat were always to be worn in the street and in church . White was only to be worn at a wedding by the bride , and otherwise never later than Labor Day . An unmarried woman was never to wear a tiara or diamonds . As for trousers ? Well , until the late ' ' 60s , a woman wearing pants was still unacceptable in some segments of polite society . Today 's style-setters wear whatever they please and do n't care what anybody thinks . Gwen Stefani gets married in a bright pink-and-white wedding dress by Dior 's John Galliano . Stella Tennant wears a white ball gown with a man's-style long blazer thrown over it like a wrap to the Metropolitan Museum 's Costume Institute gala . Sarah Jessica Parker attends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . Cate Blanchett pairs a Lanvin frock with blue jeans . Meanwhile , Gwyneth Paltrow has become a rebellious London girl , riding around the city on a scooter in a white tank and Stella McCartney pants accessorized with kohl-rimmed eyes and a crash helmet . For the Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova , retaining her own individual look has the power to outrage . When she returned home recently , she wore an outfit she favors in New York-a green cotton peasant dress she bought in Turkey , which she paired with a tiny lace top , shorts and sandals . " It shocked them , " she says . " In Russia , when you make money you are expected to show it in the clothes you wear ... but things have changed . What is modern today is not wearing labels head to toe . " Girls like Vodianova do not study a designer 's look book and then get dressed . For them , it is all about how you throw it together . The English stylist and " obsessive thrift-store shopper " Bay Garnett , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown Dior cape with gold tassels , or an original safari jacket by Yves Saint Laurent , offset by a turban and red nails . " Style to me is a form of creativity , " she says . " My wardrobe is how I express myself . " Likewise for Stockdale , copying a look book is anathema : " I never wear a whole look from one designer . It looks like you are dressing in someone else 's clothes . That is a statement of wealth , not style . " Indeed , to count as truly stylish , supreme self-confidence seems to be called for . For Elbaz , the two women who epitomize this quality are Kate Moss and Chloe Sevigny . " They are individuals and they know what is good on them , " he says . " What Chloe does with my clothes is very personal . When she wears something of mine , it never looks " new . " She wore a dramatic black dress I designed for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche to the Oscars in 2000 with such nonchalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But even Elbaz could n't have predicted how Moss would customize one of his early creations for Lanvin , a black number with a gem-encrusted neckline . " The way Kate wore my dress was inspirational , " he says , sounding emotional . " I almost killed myself , because I did not show it on the catwalk the way she wore it . " Moss hitched up the waist , creating a spontaneous minidress , and left the fastenings undone at the back . " She opened up the whole silhouette and made it much sexier . It was n't perfect-which is perfect today . " Some women are style-setters ; others will always be scared of " getting it wrong . " The international fashion icon Nan Kempner ( who dressed in Parisian haute couture as a teenager ) is definitely the former . " Let me tell you , I had the first of Yves Saint Laurent 's le smoking trouser suits in 1966 , " she tells me over the telephone from her Park Avenue home . " Black satin with straight , elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cuffs and around my waist Yves tied a red sash , with fringes . It was fabulous ! " The first night Nan wore her le smoking out in New York City was to a very smart restaurant . " ' You do n't think you are going to come in wearing pants , do you ? ' said the proprietor to me at the door . We were late and I was stunned . I looked so chic ! So I unzipped my pants and dropped them . My tunic covered the vital statistics . My husband bent over and had to pick up my pants for me , and I waltzed into dinner . " Nan says she loved the attention she received when she flouted expectations . Before she wore trousers , she was one of the first to revive the short evening dress . " It is fun to be in on the ground floor and start trends . In those days , how you dressed could mean a real revolution . " But it can be hard work being a rule-breaker all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a woman whose personality meant she was never going to follow anyone else 's rules . No one else looked like Pallenberg then ; her skinny velvet hipsters ( which she had specially made ) , high-neck satin wrap blouses , fox-fur jackets and floating scarves were way ahead of their time . " Brian Jones and Keith Richards borrowed my clothes all the time , " she recalls of the Rolling Stones . " Sometimes we would spend all day and night getting dressed up to go out and end up missing the party . " Pallenberg remembers attending the Cannes Film Festival in 1967 with Richards , wearing a " pair of fantastic gold Roman sandals with jeans and a golden sweater . I was the first to wear jeans on the red carpet . It was a groundbreaking fashion moment , " she says blithely . " But hey , if you do n't break the rules , you do n't have any fun . " Today Pallenberg , who wears her own vintage pieces mixed with avant-garde labels such as Zoltar the Magnificent ( the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business partner Barnzley ) , is still an influence on fashion-not to mention the wardrobe of her great friend Moss . " We get off on each other 's clothes , " Pallenberg says . " Kate is very like how I was at her age . She is uncontrived and wears clothes well in a sexy , casual way . " Like many truly stylish women , both believe it is all about getting the mix right . " Kate does cool things , like she will tie a scarf beneath her hips over a long T-shirt . She will put a big , old leather belt over a velvet coat . She 's got those great legs , so she is wearing a lot of miniskirts , but then she will pull on a hooded top and some diamond earrings . " The fashion editor Polly Allen Mellen , a favored protege of Diana Vreeland , has always known what-and who-is cool . " I grew up with Katharine Hepburn and her family , " says Mellen , who remembers the way the actress wore trousers when few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marc Jacobs ' muse , Sofia Coppola . " Those girls , they never look the same way twice . They keep mixing it up . No one else looks like them . " It is this overwhelming desire for originality and the unexpected that is the one element all stylish women share . From Prada 's understated passion for diamonds to McCartney 's thoroughly modern mix to Moss ' sartorial daring , the challenge is to stay one step ahead . " Anyone can do it , " Pallenberg says . " You just have to keep pulling the stunts .
