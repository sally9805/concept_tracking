Once upon a time , in the village of Snettering-on-Snoakes in the kingdom of Biddle , Rosella fetched water from the well for the four thousand and eighty-eighth time . Rosella always fetched the water because her identical twin sister , Myrtle , always refused to go . And their mother , the widow Pickering , never made Myrtle do anything . Instead , she made Rosella do everything . At the well the fairy Ethelinda was having a drink . When she saw Rosella coming , she changed herself into an old lady . Then she made herself look thirsty . " Would you like a drink , Grandmother ? " Rosella said . " That would be lovely , dearie . " Rosella lowered her wooden bucket into the well . When she lifted it out , she held the dipper so the old lady could drink . Ethelinda slurped the water . " Thank you . Your kindness merits a reward . From now- " " You do n't have . . . " Rosella stopped . Something funny was happening in her mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her tongue . And something hard in her cheek . " Excuse me . " Now there was something in her other cheek . She spat delicately into her hand . They were n't teeth . She was holding a diamond and two opals . " There , dearie . " Ethelinda smiled . " Is n't that nice ? " Chapter Two " What took you so long ? " Myrtle said when Rosella got home . " Your sister almost perished from thirst , you lazybones , " their mother said . " I gave a drink to . . . " Something was in Rosella 's mouth again . It was between her lip and her front teeth this time . " I gave a drink to an old lady . " An emerald and another diamond fell out of her mouth . They landedon the dirt floor of the cottage . " It was more important- What 's that ? " Myrtle said . " What 's that ? " the widow said . They both dove for the jewels , but Myrtle got there first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sit down . Make yourself comfortable . Now tell us all about it . Do n't leave anything out . " There was n't much to tell , only enough to cover the bottom of Myrtle 's teacup with gems . " Which way did the old lady go ? " Myrtle asked . Rosella was puzzled . " She did n't go anywhere . " An amethyst dropped into the teacup . Myrtle grabbed the bucket and ran . When she saw Myrtle in the distance , Ethelinda thought Rosella had come back . Only this time she was n't tripping lightly down the path , smelling the flowers and humming a tune . She was hurtling along , head down , arms swinging , bucket flying . And then Ethelinda 's fairy powers told her that this was Rosella 's twin sister . Ethelinda got ready by turning herself into a knight . " Where did the old lady go ? " Myrtle said when she reached the well . " I have n't seen anyone . I 've been alone , hoping some kind maiden would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it myself with all this armor . " " What 's in it for me if I do ? " The fairy tilted her head . Her armor clanked . " The happiness of helping someone in need . " " Well , in that case , get your page to do it . " Myrtle stomped off . Ethelinda turned herself back into a fairy . " Your rudeness merits a punishment , " she said . But Myrtle was too far away to hear . Myrtle went through the whole village of Snettering-on-Snoakes , searching for the old lady . The villagers knew she was Myrtle and not Rosella by her scowl and by the way she acted . Myrtle marched into shops and right into people 's houses . She opened doors to rooms and even closets . Whenever anyone yelled at her , her only answer was to slam the door on her way out . While Myrtle was in the village , Rosella went out to her garden to pick peas for dinner . As she worked , she sang . Oh , May is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , June is the flower month . Sing hey nonny June-o ! Oh , July is the hot month . Sing hey nonny July-o ! And so on . While she sang , gems dropped from her mouth . It still felt funny , but she was getting used to it . Except once she popped a pea into her mouth as she sang , and she almost broke a tooth on a ruby . Rosella had a sweet voice , but Prince Harold , who happened to be riding by , was n't musical . He would n't have stopped , except he spotted the sapphire trembling on Rosella 's lip . He watched it tumble into the vegetables . He tied his horse up at the widow Pickering 's picket fence . Rosella did n't see him , and she went on singing . Oh , November is the harvest month . Sing hey nonny November-o ! Oh , December is the last month . Sing hey ... Prince Harold went into the garden . " Maiden ... " Rosella looked up from her peas . A man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad-looking , Prince Harold thought . ' Pardon me , ' ? he said . " You 've dropped some jewels . Allow me . " " Oh ! Do n't trouble yourself , Sir . " Another sapphire and a moonstone fell out of Rosella 's mouth . Harold had a terrible thought . Maybe they were just glass . He picked up a stone . " May I examine this ? " Rosella nodded . It did n't look like glass . it looked like a perfect diamond , five carats at least . But if the gems were real , why was she leaving them on the ground ? He held up a jewel . " Maiden , is this really a diamond ? " " I do n't know , Sir . It might be . " A topaz hit Prince Harold in the forehead . He caught it as it bounced off his chin . " Maiden , have jewels always come out of your mouth ? " Rosella laughed , a lovely tinkling sound . " Oh no , Sir . It only began this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a fairy  --  " They were real then ! Harold knelt before her . " Maiden , I am Prince Harold . I love you madly . Will you marry me ?
