The drug czar is ready for pro wrestling . He already has the name , and now he 's got the prefight talk down cold . In every speech he makes in Nevada , where Bush appointee John Walters has traveled to fight an initiative that would legalize marijuana , he calls out his three sworn enemies as if he were Tupac Shakur . The czar has a problem with billionaire philanthropists George Soros , Peter Lewis and John Sperling , who have bankrolled the pro-pot movement , and he wants everyone to know he 's ready for battle . At an Elks lodge meeting in Las Vegas , he ticks off their names and says , " These people use ignorance and their overwhelming amount of money to influence the electorate . You do n't hide behind money and refuse to talk and hire underlings and not stand up and speak for yourself , " he says . By the end of a similar speech at a drug-treatment center in Reno , he says , " Let 's stop hiding . I 'm here . Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Before the new czar was appointed in December , it was the government 's preference not to address the legalizers . But the pro-pot movement has gained so much ground they ca n't be ignored as a fringe element . Americans , it turns out , are n't conflicted in their attitude toward marijuana . They want it illegal but not really enforced . A TIME/CNN poll last week found that only 34% want pot to be totally legalized ( the percentage has almost doubled since 1986 ) . But a vast majority have become mellow about official loopholes : 80% think it 's O.K. to dispense pot for medical purposes , and 72% think people caught with it for recreational use should get off with only a fine . That seeming paradox has left a huge opening for pro-pot people to exploit . Eight states allow medical marijuana , and a handful of states have reduced the sentences for pot smokers to almost nothing . <P> The midterm election Nov. 5 has lighted up the issue even more . While control of the House hangs in the balance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political trend for marijuana is clear : support is gaining . The most interesting battles on the November ballot are over pot initiatives : to allow the city of San Francisco to grow and distribute medical marijuana , to replace jail with rehab in Ohio and decriminalize marijuana use in Arizona . Many of these proposals are relatively modest , but the pro-pot forces are also raising the stakes . In spite of the electorate 's contentment with the paradox of loose enforcement , some particularly powerful people on both sides have taken extreme viewpoints in an effort to end the political stalemate and force Americans to choose . Either pot is not so bad and should be legal , or people should be arrested for smoking it . The battlefield for the showdown is Nevada , where Question 9 would allow adults to possess up to 3 oz. of pot for personal use . In fact , the state government would set up a legal market for buying and selling pot . To almost everyone 's surprise , the race is too close to call .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
