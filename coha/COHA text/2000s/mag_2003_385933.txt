A journey with Alzheimer 's <p> I WOKE UP one morning feeling like I wanted a party . I needed party supplies : toilet paper , napkins , paper towels , detergent , Clorox and chocolate . I had the money . I had the time . I had a car . But I had my Daddy . I still wanted a party ! I wanted to go to Kmart ! <p> I took an appraising look at him . He was standing and sitting today . He had just gone to the bathroom . That could hold him an hour . Kmart was n't far from here , just across town in the parallel universe where people who are considered not crazy meet to shop . God , can we please go to Kmart ? <p> As if reading my mind , Daddy said , " I want to go for a ride . " <p> " Me , too . Where do you want to go ? " I asked . <p> " Anywhere you want to go , " he answered agreeably . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandmama . " <p> I was grandmother today . So be it . " Let 's go , " I said , as I blocked Daddy 's view of the doorknob , because if he ever gets hold of one , he wo n't let go . <p> Safely past the temptation of a round , shiny object , we were out the front door , where the sun was shining . Birds were singing . <p> I suddenly remembered something important : Like God , beauty is . I remembered that beauty arises from symmetry . Usually this orderly arrangement of the parts of a whole produces the effect of beauty . As I looked at my father , my understanding of beauty suddenly expanded to encompass his chaos and beauty 's dependence upon it for definition . Although opposites , each has inherent in it the power to break the human heart . <p> While holding the car door open for Daddy , I imagined falling on my face in the dirt and giving thanks to God for beauty and for my daddy , who had , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beauty differently . Worshiping God in my spirit while still performing physical work is a new benefit of living in this promised land . <p> I now abide in a variety of realities , moving in and out of them as fluidly as Daddy 's hallucinations come and go . I praised God for this flexibility of my mind to move in concert with Daddy 's , sending an unspoken prayer that though I can and do adapt to chaos , I preferred not to embody it myself . As this felt like a betrayal of my dear daddy , I sent an apology his way , and he smiled at me . I was glad to be alive . <p> I psyched myself up to talk Daddy into getting in the car . But a miracle happened , and I did n't even ask for it . Daddy just got in the car . Thank you , Jesus . <p> Oh , we had the best time driving to Kmart . Out of joy I was singing in my heart on my way to pick up party supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of me . We sang a duet : Blessed assurance , Jesus is mine ! 0 what a foretaste of glory divine ! Heir of salvation , purchase of God , born of his Spirit , washed in his blood . This is my stony , this is my song , praising my Savior all the day long ; this is my story , this is my song , praising my Savior all the day long . <p> I had no rational explanation for praising God while Daddy was in this kind of shape . I knew only that I could not quench the gratitude I felt for my daddy beside me  --  and in that moment , Daddy even sounded like his old self . How could I make this happen again ? I tabled my question as I turned into Kmart 's parking lot . Daddy fumbled with the door , and I helped him open it . Then we were standing together outside in a public place , and his pants were not wet . Glory to God . <p> He took my hand . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden , shining in the morning dew , an oasis of riches . They had toilet paper and soap in there . As Daddy and I navigated the traffic , I stole a look at him . He was walking , walking , head up-sort of . The doors were the sliding electric kind  --  not a doorknob on them ! They opened for us  --  a mysterious phenomenon that I did not try to explain to Daddy , who would have liked to repeat this pleasure . <p> I retrieved a shopping cart and placed Dad 's hands upon it . " Thataway . " <p> Using the cart as a walker , he sprinted fleet-of-foot while I pretended I was on Supermarket Sweep . Up and down the aisles we went very fast , with Daddy setting a fast , erratic pace . Sometimes his tempo drove me crazy , but today I thought it was hilarious . Laughing , I piled the buggy high with pure luxury items . We would have Kleenex again . Paper plates . I stacked 500 coffee filters on top . God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Chocolate Hershey bars . I moaned as if I were being reunited with an old , passionate lover who could really kiss . Daddy and I grinned over the Hershey bars , and I said , " Party time ! " <p> We spent 20 whole minutes in paradise and then proceeded to the checkout , where we only had to wait behind one buggy  --  another miracle . Two women belonged to it , and they were laughing and talking in a British accent . Their voices brought back Wordsworth 's view of daily life with his sister Dorothy , who went crazy on him : For I have learned to look on nature , not as in the hour of thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes the still , sad music of humanity . <p> " Promise you 'll kill me if I ever get very sick , " one of the British ladies asked her friend . <p> " I 'll murder you straightaway , " her companion promised politely . <p> " Even if you have to go to jail ? " <p> " Anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? " <p> " Poison . Gun . " The friend shrugged nonchalantly . " Do you have a preference ? " " Give me a strong sleeping pill . Then drown me in a bathtub . There 's a good chance you could get away with murder that way . It really could look like an accident , do n't you think ? " <p> " Brilliant . And of course , you will do the same for me ? " <p> I could n't see their faces , but I watched Delia , the cashier , who wore a practiced blank expression . Should either of these two women become suddenly dead in the near future and their movements get back-tracked by a detective to Kmart , Delia was ready to say , " I did n't hear nothing . I do n't even remember those two foreigners in my checkout line . I wait on a million customers a day . How 'm I s'posed to remember them ? " <p> " Who are they ? " Daddy asked , tension gathering in his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't know them . " <p> " Somebody has died . Do we need to go to the funeral ? " " Not yet , " I said , as the two women left , laughing . <p> WE WERE CHECKED OUT efficiently , and I pushed our loaded buggy to the car . I opened the passenger door for Daddy and said , " Sit . " It sounded like I was ordering him around , but long , polite sentences troubled Daddy . I began to amend my sentence patterns and word choices right after I said to him one time , " Will you please stand up ? " and he replied , quite sensibly , " Stand up to what ? " <p> " Sit in the car , " I repeated , as he gripped the door handle and pushed on it . I did n't rush him ' . He lives in a different time zone . I speedily unloaded the buggy , putting all of the sacks in the trunk except for the party supplies , which I placed within arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished , Daddy was still standing . " Get inside the car . Party time . " <p> Knowing he was supposed to do something but unsure what , Daddy simply folded up in front of me , balancing on the running board of the car . People in the store 's parking lot stopped in their tracks , sacks ready to be tossed aside if they concluded from the drama unfolding that the old man being bossed around needed rescuing from me . Seeing their concern , I waved cheerily and said , " It 's all right . He 's just crazy . " <p> They did n't believe me . I decided that I had better get Daddy into the car before someone called the cops on me and accused me of elder abuse , so I leaned over and barked in a short command that my Alzheimer's-ridden Daddy might be able to process and that passing strangers concluded was my shrewish need to dominate an old man , " Get in the car . " <p> " I am in the car , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with him , and he began to giggle . <p> His laughter was contagious , and I might have stopped a moment , as I have many times , to explode in hysterics over the ridiculousness of our situation if I had n't had so many witnesses who might have construed my laughter as coldhearted glee gained from torturing a senior citizen who was scared enough of me to cower at my feet . <p> " You are not in the car . You are stuck on the running board . Your feet are still on the pavement , " I explained , as a man Daddy 's age returned his shopping cart to the corral and called to me , his voice rife with suspicion , " Is everything OK over there ? " <p> " We 're just fine , " I said . Lips splitting from the strain of smiling , I reached down , grabbed Daddy by his pants waistband , and hoisted him into the car . Daddy fell over on the front seat laughing . <p> The other man gave me the evil eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting Daddy 's head so that I could wedge in behind the wheel . " Please sit up , " I begged tiredly . <p> Daddy could no longer hear m6 . So I levered him upright , fastened his seat belt , and wiped the drool from his mouth . " Have you had a good outing ? " I asked brightly , backing out of our parking space . My heart was racing . A muscle was strained in my neck , and I felt my regular headache begin there . The euphoria of our trip to paradise had passed . Daddy 's chin drifted to his chest , and like a child who has played too hard , he suddenly fell asleep . <p> I drove the long way home , down Cobbs Ford Road , past the Christmas tree farm where early-bird shoppers were already buying their trees . Thinking that the city had probably already put out the holiday decorations , I snuck up on Main Street from the other side . I . turned into the parking lot of the city 's park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claus were already standing with the elves positioned around them . The wishing well was lit . It was picturesque . I have a terrible appetite for the picturesque , and I submitted to that craving . <p> I TURNED OFF the engine , and as soon as I did , Daddy woke up . Saliva pooled in the corner of his mouth , and I daubed at it with one of the paper napkins I kept handy for that job . From the back seat I drew forth the sack with the Hershey bars in it and a six-pack of juice boxes . " Let 's have our party now , " I invited . <p> His consciousness traveled the circumference of the walking trail in the park , a quarter mile , and then returned like a scavenger that is searching for clues , facts , meaning . It is the impulse that never quits . He strained to find me in the car , his one good eye peering at me curiously . <p> " You know me , " I coaxed . " We are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite-size squares and laid them on a napkin on the seat between us . " Chocolate , " I offered , but his nap had made him groggy . He stared off into space . I felt so often like I was talking to myself . It was a strange phenomenon , to be so close to someone else and still be so alone . Wordsworth had understood this moment : If I should be where I no more can hearthy voice , nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams of past existence  --  wilt thou then forget that on the banks of this delightful stream we stood together ? <p> Would I ever forget this moment in time with Daddy , when we were so alone and even the tensions of authority and rebellion had been made moot by the thief that had robbed him of the knowledge of who he was and who I am ? Picking up a chocolate square , I touched it to his lips , and he automatically opened his mouth . When his lips parted , I slid the tender candy into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on his tongue . I waited a minute or so for the chocolate to dissolve . Then I placed the thin straw of the juice box between his lips . I squeezed the box , pumping liquid through the straw . He gagged . <p> " I 'm so sorry , " I said , mopping up juice and chocolate drool . <p> His head bobbed . When his chin bounced off his chest , the residue of chocolate fell out of his mouth , and I caught it with the napkin . <p> " The party 's over , " I said . " I 'll take you home . " We made the five-minute drive home in a silence that did n't hum with shared thoughts or songs . It was a still silence . The images of the town flew by . There were people headed out to play golf , people toting Christmas trees on the roofs of their cars , people going to the Smoke House for barbecue . Did they remember that this day was a gift , every minute precious  --  every fleeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIGHT , I am awakened by the implanted revelation that Daddy needs me . I pick up my eyeglasses , which need to be changed . My vision is deteriorating , or so it seems to me , but no one has confirmed my diagnosis . I do n't have away to go to the eye doctor or any other kind of doctor . I have n't been in three years . The piano has n't been tuned in five . <p> In the shadows of early morning , I move as Mother did before me to the stairs , where I stand and listen for Daddy . <p> I do not hear him . Do I imagine his need of me ? Is God speaking ? Is it only one of the interior voices inside my own head trying to get itself born in a story ? I no longer worry about why the many selves of personhood do not coalesce into one perfect self . I know only one thing : I trust God 's love and the expression of it . " Jesus , " I testify . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep recesses of my soul , and I whisper , " I 'm on my way , " though Daddy has not called out , and when I speak , he does not answer me . <p> Down the stairs I go , my bones creaking , and I wonder if at 44 I have some disease that could possibly be cured if I had a good doctor . I let go of the question . The answer is irrelevant . I will live as ' long as I am supposed to live , and then I will die . <p> I find my daddy . <p> He is standing in the kitchen , behind the stairs , and he , quite simply , has exploded . His body is covered in urine and excrement , and he ca n't figure out what to do about it . He is immobilized , a statue . He is drooling . <p> " Help me , God . " I repeat my prayer . I fall to my knees , and in faith that I will last long enough to do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . I begin stripping my beautiful daddy . It is not an easy job to undress a man who can not follow directions as well as a child . This is not a baby 's game . <p> I will not go into the details of the clean-up . I will tell only the important part of the story . <p> Just as I felt my daddy 's presence and his need of me before I descended-the stairs , I felt the presence of Love Itself  --  God  --  in the room while I tended my sick daddy . As the Fount of Love kept me company in the daylight , so Love was present in the darkness too . <p> Strength not my own moved my body . <p> Strength not my own moved my daddy . <p> Once the clothes were in a soiled puddle on the floor , I led my naked , trusting daddy by the hand to the bathroom . We walked slowly , without a blanket or towel to wrap around him . Suddenly we were confronted by the image of ourselves in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care how this looks . God is in control , " ' I vowed to the reflection . <p> Strength to persevere grew out of this proclamation . That is a fact . <p> The man who had taught the gospel faithfully to his family stood abjectly , obedient to my leading . I led Daddy to the walk-in shower stall . After testing the water , I began at the top of his head and worked my way down , scrubbing rinsing , scrubbing rinsing , checking the crevices of his body for residue of waste and suds that might cause him to have a latent rash . <p> My beautiful daddy . Oh , I crooned words of praise for my daddy in his dilapidated state of confusion , and the sound of my voice was not an imitation of love that good girls admit in infantile crushes over their first hero ; my voice was a prayer of praise and beseechment , a mercy prayer that wrought results and peace and kept me in company with the Presence of Love . <p> When Daddy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put him back to bed . He was asleep before he lay down . I lifted his legs , covered him , kissed his face , and whispered in his ear that I was never far away . Only then did the muscles in his face grow slack , because his spirit knows the sound of my voice even if his brain no longer registers the meaning of the words . He trusts me with his life . <p> Then I sat in the corner chair during that long good night until the sun came up , and I thanked God for the expression of his love that can even look like death . <p> Daddy , I knew you were leaving the day the refrigerator stopped working again . I went and got the vacuum cleaner and used it like we had before , but nothing happened . When the motor did n't kick in , and all the cups of ice cream and yogurt that we kept stocked for you melted , I knew you were going to leave soon . I did n't try to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I let them go to waste , like expensive oil poured on Your feet , anointing you in a way that was more emotional than reasonable . <p> And for nine days at least your body hesitated , your mind coming and going as you waited for Julie Ann to come from Memphis . All of us sisters took our turns beside you in the time of your leave-taking , when loving you was not a care-giving duty  --  it was our identity and unexpectedly , at times , our joy . <p> By the way , I took little Katie shoe shopping the day that Hospice came in and urged us to tell you that it was all right to go on . I took your granddaughter shoe shopping , and I bought her six pairs of new shoes because I wanted her to associate death with going places  --  different kinds of exciting places , where a seven-year-old girl needs all kinds of footgear for traveling . <p> Katie retained that faithful habit of coming to tell you good night every night until the end . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us would harmonize with her small lead voice , deferring to the innocence and hope of a lullaby that says farewell and hello in the way that only the gospel can . <p> We did not try to keep her from you , or keep you from anyone who wanted to say good-bye . When my turn came , I told the truth as I understood it and was able to give voice to it : I have adored you , and I always will . You look like you 're dying , but the truth is , I think your soul is trying to get born . Go be with a love that is greater than mine . <p> ON THE DAY we buried Daddy , the preacher was just right . The Reverend Philip Black knew a few funny stories that reminded grieving people of who Jerry Simpkins had been when in his right mind . He told the stories over the closed casket that contained Jerry 's body . " Jerry heard the gospel when he was 21 years old , and boy , did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciatively . <p> " I remember what my own family thought about Jerry when they first met him . My wife thought he was a fine specimen of a man . Like a movie star . The strongest man she had ever seen , and he could do anything . " <p> I relaxed and settled back next to my sisters . The preacher was telling some truths , and that did a good work in me . <p> " He was a good businessman and a good father , too . Worked three jobs at one time to support his family . " <p> My sisters and I began to nod , for on , he was penetrating our defenses with words of truth  --  memories that did n't hurt because there was no lie in them . <p> The preacher shifted his body to look right at us . " You girls may look back on your days with your daddy and have regrets ... " <p> " No , we do n't , " we said in unison , doing the unthinkable . My sisters and I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other to say the truth back and forth : " Daddy was loved , and he knew it  --  maybe not in his mind but in his bones and his blood  --  till the day he died . " <p> The preacher blinked . " OK . You girls wo n't have any regrets , then . " <p> " That 's the truth " we all agreed . <p> My sisters knew the truth . I knew the truth . Daddy had lived the truth . He died , but the truth lived on in us . We had known love together , and we had rightly inferred from that life of love lived out in faith that the Maker of Love is real  --  as real as life and death . <p> This article is adapted from her book The Long Good Night : My Father 's Journey into Alzheimer 's , just published by Eerdmans .
