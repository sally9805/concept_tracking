6:30 a.m . OLD DOWNTOWN BRIDGE First come the schoolkids  --  dozens of them , over the old concrete bridge , some in the plaid-skirt , white-blouse uniforms of Roman Catholic schools , others dressed public school casual . Some were born in the U.S. ; some have permanent residency status there , but their parents prefer to live on the Mexican side , where it 's cheaper . So they use a relative 's U.S. address to register for school and commute . The two local school districts ( one larger than the state of Delaware ) do n't know how many students are from the other side ; they are forbidden by law to ask . In any case , the town ca n't build elementary school space fast enough . Jesse Saldivar , chief inspector for U.S. Customs downtown , recognizes the faces as they pass through the gates . " I 've seen them grow up , " he says , making step motions with his hand . <P> 7 a.m . INTERNATIONAL BANK OF COMMERCE A bank open before breakfast ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open 7 to 7 daily , including Sundays . Walk into the main office of the IBC and listen : English rarely spoken here . Upstairs in the executive offices , executive vice president Gerald Schwebel explains that his mother is Mexican , his father Austrian ; he went to school in Nuevo Laredo . Bilingual , binational , he is the whole global economy in a suit . Schwebel 's bank , the biggest in town with assets of more than $6 billion , has a small fleet of jets at the airport standing by to fly bankers to Europe , Asia and , of course , Mexico to finance deals . " If you are interested in trade , " he says , " this is the living laboratory . " <P> 8 a.m . WORLD TRADE BRIDGE Toll collector Robert Fuentes unlocks the grimy padlock and unloops heavy chains at the gate to the bridge  --  one of five busy spans . The bridge is 13 months old and reveals just how open  --  and closed  --  the border is these days . It 's sleek , wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have electronic passes that let them zip right through . But the bridge is also slung with concertina wire ; 55 state and federal agencies  --  from the irs to the FDA  --  have offices in town . Here only Customs and the National Guard carry side arms . The feds lack the troops to check every truck , so they inspect randomly . On an average day , about 8,000 trucks will cross here , hauling copper wire and auto parts into Mexico and bringing clock radios and car chassis back . Customs collects $619,000 in federal taxes and duties daily . <P> This morning , truck No. 11 in line to the U.S. belongs to Martin Castano . His dented Chevy pickup , loaded with pinatas shaped like Betty Boop and Winnie the Pooh , is dwarfed next to a semi carrying 15 tons of yellow bulldozer claws . Castano usually makes the trip twice a day and can pocket $150 each time . But because it would be easy to stuff marijuana inside Betty or Winnie , he is always waved over for inspection . Castano says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smugglers , but he pays his men only $50 a week , and that makes them easy marks for even small bribes . Customs officers take no chances . They direct Castano 's Chevy to a large X-ray machine , big enough to scan two semis at once , that can sometimes detect what the sniffer dogs may miss .
