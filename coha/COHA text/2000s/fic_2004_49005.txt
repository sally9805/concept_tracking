" ... moths hear sounds through their wings . " <p> " Moths require only three things to survive and breed : <p> food , shade , and privacy . " <p> " Moths do n't eat wool ... Only the larval form of <p> the moths are wool eaters . " <p> There are over ten thousand five hundred identified species of moths in North America alone . When one of the species started to appear in the family summer cottage , my wife , Ginger , would capture one moth at a time using a quart-sized plastic take-out container to trap them with and a piece of paper , which she slid between it and the wall and used as a lid while she carried them outside to freedom . " Ginger ! " I 'd call out as I 'd hear her open the screen door . " Did you turn off the kitchen light ? " If she did n't answer me I knew it was too late and several more moths had probably found their way inside . When the situation started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked , my mother and I , each in our own way , went after the slow-flying nocturnal insects with identical green plastic fly swatters that came with the house twenty-five years ago . I 'd eye several of them , then swat hard and fast , while my mother was slower , gentler , but just as effective . After a while we 'd stop , and I 'd sweep them off the floor , where they often left a stain , and pick up the ones that fell on the furniture by their now flattened wings . Ginger would have no part in it . It was n't that she did n't understand the necessity of clearing a house of pests and did n't know that sometimes there just is n't a choice-after all , her father supported their family by running a small private exterminating business in Texas-it was just that she did n't get any satisfaction from killing them . Our dogs , both of whom had been abandoned in New York City parks , reacted to the swatting frenzy in their typical ways . Parker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor unfazed , as he is about almost everything except being separated from me when suitcases are packed . Sasha , our sensitive Shepherd mix who appeared with Ginger in an outdoor theater production of A Midsummer Night 's Dream , would squeeze under our bed and hide there with our clutter of shoes , sneakers , suitcases , and balls of dust and dog fur . It 's where she goes when thunderstorms , firecrackers , and other natural or unnatural disturbances creep into her life . It 's where Ginger and I sometimes want to hide from each other , but neither of us can fit . <p> Maybe it was the endless rain we had all spring and summer , or maybe it was a test . The moth population exploded , and I could n't stop killing them , even when I grew tired and ashamed of the game I 'd created-spy one , creep up on it , then swat with one hand and catch dead moth in a tin-foil container with the other before it hit the floor , thus avoiding any cleanup afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into plastic garbage bag , but make sure all moths are dead first . It was dirty work , work I told my mother she should not do anymore , and work that probably should have been done by an exterminator . Some moths splattered a thick , sticky liquid-I imagine those were the females ready to lay their eggs-while others were so dry they literally dissolved into a fine powdery dust that inevitably ended up in our throats and lungs . <p> There 's a family story , a true one , that 's told at least once a summer to anyone that will listen . It starts off : One warm summer night , many years ago , my father woke up in the middle of the night and could n't get back to sleep . This in itself was unusual , for he was a splendid sleeper who loved to dream . Something that night was not right in his head . It was as if he were being tickled from the inside out , and he kept hearing this terrible fluttering sound deep inside his ear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear it . Not knowing what to make of it , but knowing for certain it was not a dream , he turned over and woke up my mother and tried to describe what was happening but could n't find the words . Since I was the only other person in the house at the time , my mother woke me up and told me not to worry , but she was going to drive my father to the emergency room in the nearby town because he was hearing something strange in his head . My father , who was a psychotherapist , was used to hearing about the strange things his patients heard in their heads , but this , this was different because no words were actually being spoken . The emergency-room doctor , a friendly man with a good bedside manner , asked my father a few trick questions to determine if he was , in fact , sane , and when my father easily passed the test , the doctor began examining his left ear . After an unsuccessful and unpleasant ear wash , the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the surgeon he aspired to be , carefully extracted an enormous live brown moth , a curious bug who , like me , wanted to know what was going on deep inside my father 's head . The doctor held up the moth for my father to see , then called over the nurse and security guard , who agreed that it was by far the largest one they 'd ever seen . <p> I do n't know what ultimately happened to the moth that doctor extracted from my father 's ear . Maybe it ended up in the ER 's garbage can , or pinned down in someone 's private collection , or maybe the doctor set it free later that night . When this story was told again this summer to an unsuspecting visitor , it got me to thinking there 's no escaping your fate : you either pay now , or you pay later . It 's pretty simple , really , when you think about it . Ginger started taking the dogs on a field trip each night while I tended to the current moth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say , and off the three of them would go , into the car and then up the dark mountain road overlooking the lake , where she 'd stop and let them run free in the woods for a while . The joy in the killing , if there ever was one , was gone . The only thing that remained was obsession . <p> One night while Ginger and I were up at the house alone , she held up a picture of an old donkey standing alone on a dirt road for me to see . It was from one of the calendars mailed to us each year for donating to various animal rights organizations . " Can I read you the caption ? " she asked . I did n't want her to read the caption to me . I 've read many captions on many animal rights calendars before , but telling her not to read it would n't have stopped her , so I said , " Sure , " and tried to pay attention because I thought I might want her attention later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she read , then stopped to make sure I was really listening and held up the picture for me to see again . " All the animals you ever encountered in your lifetime are at the gates of heaven deciding if you will enter or be turned away . " " Oh , " I said and put down the fly swatter I had just picked up , then looked at Parker lying so peacefully under the table , his head resting on one of his paws , his brown eyes focused lovingly on me . At least there would be one vote in my favor . <p> I stopped trying to guess how many moths I killed during those weeks . Our twelve oversized porch screens are old and so warped that they do n't fit together tightly anymore . At the beginning of each spring I stretch masking tape between the gaps , but it 's never a perfect seal , and that 's probably how most of them got in . The neighbors across the road , the ones we do n't know , the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never , have a clear view of our porch at night when we turn the lights on . I could feel them watching me from the darkness of their old house as I climbed on chairs and occasionally used a broom to reach up to the highest parts of the slanted ceiling to swat at any moth 1 could find . I wondered if they had the same kind of infestation in their house , and I wondered what they were thinking , though 1 knew they 'd never tell me . <p> Moths were n't the only animals we encountered that summer . As I was cleaning the garage , a haven and a final resting place for all sorts of animals during the winter months , I accidentally uncovered a mouse in the middle of giving birth . She was startled . I was startled . That 's all . I did n't kill her or her pink babies . I just watched . A few days later I found another one in the same state in a box I was about to throw out . The mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have seen Ginger approaching , her blue eyes wide open in amazement . The mouse 's eyes , unlike Ginger 's , were tiny and brown and bulging , and its long whiskers were extended , moving about the air trying to size up the situation , trying to decide if fight or flight was the best response , though in her condition she had little choice . I gently placed the box on the ground , and Ginger knelt down and talked to her in her gentle " for animals only " voice and explained that we would not harm her or her babies . When Ginger stopped talking , the mouse ducked back into the nest she had built for the birth , so I placed it back in the garage and closed the door . Maybe next year when we opened the house again in the spring , I would throw out the box , bloody nest , droppings and all . <p> Mars is made of cheese , and all mice dream of living there one day when they retire . This is not a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , I read about Mars in The New York Times . The article said Mars was closer to Earth now than it has been in sixty thousand years , and that it was clearly visible and distinct in the night sky . It did n't mention that on a good clear night in the city , you 're lucky if you can see ten stars and make out the Big Dipper . That night , as I was walking the dogs , I looked up , and there it was . There was no doubt about it . It was Mars , a reddish , no , yellowish , almost golden spot of light orbiting around the sun , like us , though it seemed to be standing still every time I looked at it . It 's another simple grade-school fact , like the gradual changing of the seasons and the earth forever spinning on its axis , and the moon waxing and waning right in front of our very eyes , affecting the ocean 's tides and sensitive people 's moods . <p> We learned other simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moths actually do fly into open flames and that they can catch on fire and be quite dangerous . We also learned that the sky over the city is , in fact , still full of stars , and that elevators , gasoline pumps , and traffic lights run on electricity , and ice cream melts if it 's not kept frozen , and every home and office should be stocked with emergency supplies like transistor radios and flashlights ( with the right size batteries for them and not so old that they 've drained their charge to the air ) and at least one phone that 's hard-wired , and candles and matches and canned food ( especially tuna fish ) , and water for drinking and water to flush the toilet , and a good supply of all necessary prescription drugs , and a community of family or friends to rely on , to check up on each other , to comfort and care for , to teach survival skills to , like how to get along with your neighbors , even if they do n't talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches and other essential supplies like books and stories and pens and paper and even glasses , eyeglasses if necessary , because Mars is light years away and there 's no easy way for you or me to get there , especially if we do n't have any power , and even if we did , we 're still not sure if there 's any water up there . <p> In November , on an unusually warm weekend , we searched the summer house for any leftover moths , but by then they 'd all died on their own , and all I had to do was sweep them up . We defrosted the refrigerator , shut off the water , drained the pipes , poured antifreeze in the toilet , turned off the propane gas tank , took off all the screens and replaced them with thick wooden shutters that also no longer fit very well , sealed all the blankets and sheets in plastic bags , shut off the circuit breakers , and welcomed the mice that had already snuck in for the winter . We did n't place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year and have n't for many years . We 've given up on thinking they make a difference , and besides , they 're cruel to the animals , the dogs might eat the poison by mistake , and most of the mice do leave in the spring before we open up again , though they leave their droppings everywhere . <p> One night in December , before the first early snow arrived , I was walking our dogs in Riverside Park around one in the morning and met a fellow late-night dog-walker . For a reason I still have n't figured out , I often run into him on the eve of Jewish holidays , and we talk about them , and he kind of tests me to see if I remember what they are supposed to be about . But that night it was n't a Jewish holiday , and so I asked him if he 'd been watching Mars lately . I pointed up at the sky to where I was observing it before I saw him . he adjusted his wire-framed glasses , which always rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction until he found her himself , and then he just stared into outer space for a while . When he came out of his short trance and we started walking , he said it was strange that we can see light that 's been reflected millions of miles but we ca n't see things that are right in front of us . I thought he was going to refer to things like how other people feel , but it turned out he was referring to simpler things , things like radio waves and sound waves and electromagnetic fields . We got to talking metaphysically about the universe and about our significance or insignificance in it , and then he asked me if I 'd ever studied Nietzsche . I told him I had n't , though I knew who Nietzsche was . he told me Nietzsche questioned everything , especially God , and that one day while he was walking he saw an old horse being beaten for no apparent reason and became so upset that he ran up to it , wrapped his arms around the horse 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was never the same after that . <p> Questioning the existence of God is one of my pastimes , too . So is contemplating the infiniteness of outer space , though if I give either of these subjects too much attention I lose track of whatever else I 'm supposed to be doing . These kinds of questions fit into some of the very big Whys I have , and I 'm not always up for them . <p> We kept on walking . I had thought about telling him about the moth infestation we had in the summer and my " pay now or pay later " theory , but decided not to and instead told him what popped into my mind next , which was a novel I had read a very long time ago , Strange Life of Ivan Osokin , by the Russian philosopher P. D. Ouspensky . The book 's first chapter is the exact same as the last chapter , but you do n't know it until you finish the book , and then you start reading it over again because it never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My high school teacher who assigned it told us he was going to quit teaching at the end of that semester and do something real with his life . When someone in the back of the room asked him what that was , he said he was going to move upstate , buy a hardhat , and build a road that went from one place to another and then to another and another until the road eventually ended up right where it started and he 'd be back home again . <p> As we continued to talk philosophically about this and that , our dogs sort of listened , but they did n't try to make sense of what we were saying , arid that 's a good thing because I 'm not sure I was understanding or making sense of anything anymore . It 's kind of like when you say a word too many times in a row and it loses its meaning , and besides , they were busy playing and watching out for us while I tried to steer the conversation back to something more tangible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Jewish holiday . <p> When I came home that night the feathers of the dreamcatcher hanging from the bookshelf were still , its drum silent . The Wandering Jews stretched toward the window in anticipation of the morning light , and the three wooden giraffes on the table still looked startled . The steel dachshund with the thick magnifyingglass eyes that I call " the psychiatrist " was staring at me again the way my father used to , unashamed in his inquisitiveness . The real dogs settled in for the night , but I still was n't tired , so I looked in on Ginger as she slept . The dress she will wear when she becomes Emily Dickinson on stage hangs on the bedroom door , protected from dog fur by a cellophane bag . Her auburn wig rests on a Styrofoam head-shaped stand while the words to Emily 's poems are aflutter in her head , competing for space with her dreams and nightmares . There is sometimes a sad tenseness in her body , her voice , her eyes , and I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stud in her ear catches a hint of lamplight as she turns in her sleep and hugs an old pillow instead of me . I placed a simple kiss on her cheek without waking her to drown out the familiar latenight sounds of sanitation trucks slowly making their way down the street , picking up the refuse we all leave behind . For a change I sat in front of the TV , but I did n't automatically turn it on . Inside its dusty , dark green screen I saw a reflection of myself . My features were not clear , my eyes almost invisible , the way I imagine them to be most of the time . And there I was , a man , an infinitely small spot on time , thinking about all my relatives who are gone , and I name them , one at a time , and dwell on those I knew better . I am no closer to understanding anything , no closer to any truths . I see their shadows and lines , their waves and expressions . I hear voices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except the mechanical hum of the HVAC system that sits on top of the Children 's Museum across the street . <p> I knew I needed to get at least a few hours of sleep , but I still was n't tired , so I propped up several pillows and used them as a backrest and then stared at the painting opposite our bed where bears are dancing in a field surrounded by a dense forest , kicking up their heels and swinging one another . Some are playing musical instruments New Orleans style . Others are eating and drinking at a picnic table or lounging nearby . Most are brown or black , a few white . They are coming in from all parts of the forest , gathering for some sort of bear celebration . After I turned off the light , one of them asked me to dance , and I did , and then I drank the fermented drink they offered me and laughed with them and sang one of their songs out loud because tomorrow there would be bills to pay and letters to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would breathe in the dust of papers and listen to the click-clack of the computer keys and answer the phone in a friendly voice even though I was very tired and did n't want to talk to anyone . <p> There are strange things going on in the universe these days . Solar flares are erupting , disturbing delicate machines all the way down here on earth , and NASA has successfully landed two new vehicles on Mars , but so far neither of them have found any signs of life . And one night , not too long ago , the earth came directly between the sun and the moon and cast a shadow on it , giving it a warm reddish glow . Ginger and I stood with a small group of people we did n't know near the bagel store on Broadway looking up at the sky , past the streetlamps , past the apartment buildings , past our differences . On every corner people stood and watched and pointed up and told each other things they never told them before . Schoolteachers and astrologists might simply call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , much more than that . I do n't know what to call it-the end of an era , the end of a long period of mourning , the end of arguing for argument 's sake , the end of lying because everyone else does it , the end of questioning things we already know the answers to . I do n't know . Maybe it 's just another one of those simple facts we take for granted , like each other , or that moths hear sounds through their wings . <p>
