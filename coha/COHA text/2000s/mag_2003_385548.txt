Section : AUTOMOTIVE : Car Care Hissy Fit <p> I have a slow leak in one of the alloy wheels on my SUV . It 's coming from between the rim and the bead of the tire . I remember you showed how to clean the bead surface of steel wheels in your column a couple of years ago . I had the same problem then and had the wheel sandblasted and completely repainted . I think the corrosion is caused by backing my truck into the salt water when I put my boat in to go fishing . Can I just sandblast these alloys like the steel wheels ? They 're clearcoated . BUBBA LORDATIN TALLAHASSEE , FL <p> <p> If you have a light coating of corrosion lilting the bead off the rim and letting air escape , you can do pretty much what I suggested for steel wheels . Use a wire brush to remove the corrosion , and paint the affected area with a rattle can . More serious corrosion calls for more serious measures . I sandblast steel rims all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for primer . Never sandblast anything made of aluminum . The abrasive leaves tiny sharp edges behind , and they represent tiny stress risers - which lead to cracks , which lead to rim failure . Find a shop that can do carbonate- or plastic media blasting . These processes are commonly used to strip paint from plastic-bodied cars like Corvettes . They also do a great job of stripping alloy wheels without damaging them , leaving behind a great surface for paint , I have a glass-beading cabinet in my shop . It does a good job , but be careful with this process . The glass-bead blasting media - tiny spherical beads that are smaller than grains of sand - wo n't damage the aluminum . But , most shops use the glass-beading cabinet for cleaning pistons and assorted junk , and this leaves the glass beads contaminated with abrasives . If you use glass beads , use fresh ones . Any body shop can refinish alloy wheels with the correct paints - but be sure to ask how they strip the old paint . Nozzied <p> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainy day , and I accidentally filled the tank with 13 gal . of diesel . I got about 2 miles before it choked to a stop . I had it towed to a dealer who says the damage may come to as much as $7000 to $8000 . Is this true ? SIVA PALANISAMY VIA INTERNET <p> <p> I doubt the engine was damaged . Drain as much of the diesel as possible out of the tank . Dispose of this gas-contaminated diesel fuel . Add a couple of gallons of gasoline to the tank . Cycle the ignition key to On , wait 5 seconds and then turn it off . Do this five times to turn on the fuel pump and purge the diesel from the fuel lines . Repeat the process at least two more times ( drain , add fuel , cycle the key on and off five times ) . Fill the tank with premium because any residual diesel will lower the octane of the gasoline . Try to start the car - crank for 10 seconds , then wait 30 seconds . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray carb cleaner to dry off the diesel . I 'd run the car for a few days and then replace the fuel filter . <p> All of this probably will turn on your Check Engine light . To turn off the light , remove the fuse for the engine-management computer for 30 seconds and replace it . If it comes back on and the engine seems to be running fine , wait a couple of tankfuls of gas to see if it goes off on its own . An III Wind Blows Cold <p> My wife was complaining that the air conditioner on our Olds Silhouette was n't working well . This minivan has two cabin air filters , and I found over a gallon of dog food pellets on top of the filters . I stuffed steel wool in the open areas where I think rodents may have entered , but I wonder if you have any cure . ERNIE BINS VIA INTERNET <p> <p> I wrote last summer about using mothballs to keep mice and chipmunks out of cars , and a couple of readers wrote in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how well the dryer sheets will work - but they have to smell better than the mothballs . I suggest getting rid of that overfed dog and getting a cat . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Mike Allen <p> Patriot <p> Parking-lot rash is annoying enough , but my neighbor received a really good hit from some incosider- ate moron with a trailer hitch . It put a serious hurtin ' on the bumper of his sedan . Like most bumpers today , this " bumper " is really a thin plastic skin over the actual bumper . And it is painted to match the exterior sheetmetal of his car . The underlying plastic is black , so the quarter-inchwide scar was visible from far away . His insurance company refused to have it repaired , and the local body shop wanted more than $300 to repair and repaint the part . The shop claimed the plastic is difficult to paint , and would n't give a warranty on the paint job . <p> Balderdash . Repainting plastic automotive panels is commonplace today , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts . The techniques and materials are a little different from those used for metal , but it does n't justify hiking the cost by 50 percent . My neighbor solved the entire issue by covering the damage with an American flag decal . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> SERVICE TIPS Groaning because of the groaning noise from the rear of your 1999-2001 Odyssey when you apply the brakes ?
