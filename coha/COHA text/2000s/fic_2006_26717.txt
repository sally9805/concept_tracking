Raiders Night By Robert Lipsyte HarperTeen Robert Lipsyte The Back Pack hit the gym in the early afternoon , Matt in the lead , before the yuppies marched in from work , while the young moms were rushing out to pick up their kids from day camp . Matt liked the way their hot eyes roamed over him , wondered if they knew he was still in high school , wondered if they cared . He felt big and hard . Excited . Was it the moms or what was waiting for him upstairs , the iron weights that would make him even bigger , harder . And the juice . Brody poked him from behind with the football he always carried . " Check the headlights on the one in blue . " " Someday I 'm gon na stick that ball up your ass . " " Ooooh , do n't tease me , big boy . " Matt led them through the downstairs crowd of designer spandex and pastel sweats , cuties perched on shiny machines jiggling away to love songs as they pretended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He liked the sense of leaving their soft world behind as he led the Back Pack up the metal steps into the stink and clang of the second floor , the real workout room . He was glad they had beaten the linemen to the gym today . Give us a chance to get our session going without Ramp 's crap . The ironheads were there ; they were always there , older white guys screaming each other into one more pec-busting rep . They wore tank topsand bandannas that looked like they were soaked in diesel fuel . One of them called out a singsong , half-mocking " Rai-derz . " Tyrell raised two fists . " Raiders rule , niggaz ! " The ironheads liked that and banged metal plates . Some of them had gone to Nearmont High and played ball . " Matt ? " The gym owner , Monty , came out of his office and beckoned him over . " New shipment 's in . " Matt nodded and felt the excitement rise . Perfect timing . Load up just before camp so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He flashed the Back Pack a thumbs-up . Hope they all brought their wallets . They dressed quickly . They were jittery , psyched for the last heavy workout before camp . Tyrell , as usual , complained about the music on the upstairs speakers , a pounding mix of disco and heavy metal . The ironheads controlled those CDs . For now . See what happens if we win Conference this year . Matt caught Pete sneaking peeks at himself in the mirror . Pete was more self-conscious than the rest of them about the pimples on his shoulders . Backne they called it . From the steroids . Price you pay . Pete 's girlfriend , Lisa , was n't so sure it was worth the price . She 'd said as much , and Pete listened to her . Girls hear about the side effects , but how could they know the feeling of watching a muscle grow bigger and harder ? Pete flexed his biceps when he thought no one was looking , as if to remind himself that Lisa did n't know everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wondered if he was taking this captain thing too seriously . " Tyrell says bicep curls win hot girls , " said Tyrell . He mimicked Pete 's flex . Pete , embarrassed , snapped his shirt at Tyrell , who laughed and danced just out of range . They loved to watch Tyrell move . He had radar . He glided like a phantom . He was the best running back in the conference . If we stay healthy and tight , Matt thought , this could be our season . Maybe State . Senior year , what a way to go . Out on the mats , stretching , Matt could tell Brody 's mind was heading to the same place . " We got a shot . " Brody 's big freckly face had that dreamy look . Probably imagining himself winning the state title . With a quarterback sneak . Not a forty-yard bomb to me or a handoff to Tyrell , but a heroic scramble out of a collapsing pocket and a desperate lunge over the goal line . Behind his back , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't throw to Matt enough . But Brody was all right . Best friend on the team . " One day at a time , " said Matt . " You 're , like , channeling Coach Mac , " said Brody . " You ready to put the bar where your mouth is ? " Matt held up the clipboard with their workout schedule . " See what I mean ? " They started with squats , lunges , and power cleans to build up their legs and lower backs for the explosive starts off the line of scrimmage . These were the most intense exercises in the daily program the coaches had laid out in the spring . Matt had come to realize that if they left those exercises to the end of the session , they would slack off , especially Pete and Brody . They preferred to work harder on the lat pull downs , the curls and flys to build up their upper bodies for the beach . But they listened to Matt . He was their leader . Tyrell had named them the Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete , and Matt had played together since PeeWee . Tyrell had joined them as a sophomore after he came out from New York , staying at his aunt 's house during the week so he could go to Nearmont High . The linemen stomped in , Ramp bellowing , " Yo , Rydek , your girls done yet ? " Before Matt could respond , Tyrell shouted , " Where you been ? Stop off for lunch at the hog farm ? " Ramp cursed , raised a finger , and led the linemen into the locker room . Matt waited until they were out of earshot . " Chill . " " Nobody cool says chill no more . " " Our last season , last chance to win Conference . " He glared at Tyrell until he nodded and started pulling dumbbells off the rack . " Let 's be a team . " " You always right , Cap'n Matt , sir . " Matt and Brody moved to the benches . It took a few reps to clear his head , but once Matt felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
