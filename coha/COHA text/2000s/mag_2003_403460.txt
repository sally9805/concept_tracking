Our antioxidant needs become ever greater as we age . By 40 our antioxidant needs are so much higher than ever before that we need powerful whole foods in our diet , as well as nutritional supplements that enable us to meet our body 's essential requirements . Clinical studies suggest that increasing the antioxidant status of our blood serum will result in the reduced risk of many chronic degenerative diseases . Educating health conscious consumers on the vital contribution antioxidant-rich foods and nutritional supplements can make to their health and longevity is of great importance in today 's world . Dietary and life style recommendations , along with the use of nutritional supplements ( particularly those with the highest antioxidant potencies ) , will significantly aid in improving your health and reaching your maximum life span , which is generally thought to be 120 years . ORAC-the Antioxidant Potency Gold Standard The term " ORAC , " short for " oxygen radical absorbance capacity , " developed by scientists at Brunswick Laboratories in collaboration with Tufts University , is an in vitro analysis that measures the antioxidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foods that score high in the ORAC antioxidant analysis help to protect cells and their components from oxidative damage , according to the chief scientific agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Studies of animals and human blood at the USDA Research Service 's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging indicate that eating plenty of high ORAC fruits and vegetables ( such as blueberries and spinach ) , may help slow the processes associated with aging in the body and brain . " If these findings are borne out in further research , young and middle-aged people may be able to reduce risks of age-related diseases , including senility , simply by adding high ORAC foods to their diets , " says one scientist involved with the program . In human and animal studies , people eating plenty of high ORAC foods : * Raised the antioxidant power of human blood 10-25 percent * Prevented some loss of long-term memory and learning ability in middle-aged rats * Maintained the ability of brain cells in middle-aged rats to respond to a chemical stimulus-a function that normally decreases with age * Protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesis that oxidative damage culminates in many of the maladies of aging is well accepted in the medical and health communities . This evidence has spurred skyrocketing sales of antioxidant supplements . If consumption of a wide range of antioxidant rich foods and nutritional formulas is implemented conscientiously on a daily basis , this will greatly contribute to keeping a person young and healthy . Top Scoring ORAC Foods Based on evidence , experts suggest that daily intake should be at least 3000 to 5000 ORAC units to have a significant impact on plasma and tissue antioxidant capacity . According to estimates however , the average American consumes only 1000 to 2000 ORAC units per day . // Top-scoring Fruits and Vegetables ORAC Units per 100 grams ( about 3 oz. ) // The Alchemy of Homeostatic Nutrient Complexes-Bringing Nutrients to Life Homeostatic Nutrient ( HN ) complexes are vitamins and minerals that have been liberated and potentiated with probiotic microorganisms and their by-products , including enzymes and organic acids . This process is not merely a blending of foods in a vat at a manufacturing plant but rather it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artisan craft . The process of turning ordinary vitamins and minerals into living whole food structures can be called " organic transmutation . " Our bodies naturally recognize organic , plant-derived vitamins and minerals because nature transforms them into organic materials instead of allowing them to remain in their elemental form . Whenever vitamins and minerals come into contact with the beneficial by-products of probiotic fermentation , they are naturally dissolved into an ionic form . These nutrients literally become part of the whole food complex during the production of the homeostatic nutrient complexes . Perhaps the most exciting result of this fermentation process is the fact that the beneficial microorganisms and enzymes remain viable , creating many powerful antioxidant compounds that are " alive " in the formula , thus imparting to it unique probiotic properties . This abundant array of efficacious probiotics and enzymes not only expertly deliver nutrients but also continue to work in the body , providing many health-enhancing benefits . Longer fermentation ( 21 to 42 days ) allows for the probiotics to create a much larger variety and concentration of health-promoting compounds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their preferred form and made " body ready , " thereby activating all necessary cofactors including enzymes , vitamins , minerals and amino acids . Also created are multitudes of novel bio-chemicals that the body craves , including the body 's master antioxidant Superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , as well as various immune-supportive beta-glucans , antimicrobial peptides , bacteriocins , biosurfactants , biotin , coenzymes , conjugated linoleic acid , glutathione , chromium compounds , hydrogen peroxide , lactic acid , lysozyme and many others-all significantly contributing to a high ORAC value . Special Substances Boost ORAC Value Many reports have been published on the beneficial use of humic substances , especially fulvic acid , for human health and medicine . Again we return to one of the ancient secrets of health and longevity . We now know that fulvic acid is part of the earth 's natural recycling process . Researchers call it " one of the most important missing links in the human food chain , " and it was once present in small amounts in our foods and drinking water . Fulvic acid contains all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids from the original plant matter , highly concentrated , refined , transformed and enhanced by the actions of innumerable microscopic plants . Even small strands of RNA , DNA and plant photosynthetic materials still remain intact .
