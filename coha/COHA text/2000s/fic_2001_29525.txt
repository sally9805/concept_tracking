BROTHERHOOD SUNDOWN HAD BLOODIED THE HORIZON over the uneven rooftops of South Boston . Birds were perched on every roof and seemed to be watching the girl walking slowly below . Kathleen Beavier made her way down a shadowy side street that was as alien to her as the faraway surface of the moon . Actually , she was here in Southie because it was so frozen , so obscure to her . She had on a fatigue jacket , long patterned skirt , and black combat-style boots the urban streetwear look . The boots rubbed raw circles into her heels , but she welcomed the pain . It was a distraction from the unthinkable thing she had come to do . This is so spooky , so unreal , so impossible , she thought . The sixteen-year-old girl paused to catch her breath at the sparsely trafficked intersection of Dorchester and Broadway . She did n't look as if she belonged here . She was too preppy , maybe too pretty . That was her plan , though . She 'd never bump into anyone she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed her gold wire-rimmed glasses back into her blond hair . She 'd washed it earlier with Aveda shampoo and rinsed it with conditioner . It seemed so absurd and ridiculous to have worried about how her damn hair would look . She squeezed her eyes shut and uttered a long , hopeless cry of confusion and despair . Kathleen finally forced open her eyes . She blinked into the slashing red rays of the setting sun . Then she scanned her Rolex Lady Datejust wristwatch for the millionth time in the past hour . God , no . It was already past six . She was late for her doctor 's appointment . Shepushed forward into the ruins of Southie . Ahern 's funeral parlor loomed in her peripheral vision , then slipped away . She hurried past the crumbling St. Augustine 's parish church , past hole-in-the-wall bars , a boarded-up strip of two-storied row houses , a street person peeing against a wall covered with graffiti . She thought of an old rock song , " Aqualung , " by Jethro Tull . She whipped herself forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England cold . Tears ran from her eyes and dribbled down over her chin . Hurry , hurry . You have to do this terrible thing . You 've come this far . It was already twenty after the hour when she finally turned the corner onto West Broadway . She instantly recognized the gray brick building wedged in between a twenty-four-hour Laundromat and a pawnshop . This is the place . This ... hellhole . The walls were smeared with lipstick-red and black graffiti : Abortion = Murder . Abortion is the Unforgivable Sin . There was a glass door and beside it a tarnished brass plaque : WOMEN 'S MEDICAL CENTER , it read . Sorrow washed over her and she felt faint . She did n't want to go through with it . She was n't sure that she could . It was all terribly , horribly unfair . Kathleen pressed her hand to the doorplate . The door opened into a reassuring reception room . Pastel-colored plastic chairs ringed the perimeter . Posters of sweet-faced mothers and chubby babies hung on the walls . Best of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen took a clipboard left out on a countertop . A sign instructed her to fill out the form as best she could . Ensconced in a baby blue chair , she printed her medical history in block letters . Her hands were shaking harder now . Her foot , trapped in her trendy combat boot , would n't stop tapping . Kathleen probed her memory for something , anything , that would make sense of this . Nothing did ! This ca n't be happening to me ! I should n't be in the Women 's Medical Center . She had made out with boys , but damn it , damn it , damn it , she knew the difference between kissing and . . . fucking . She 'd never gone all the way with anyone . Never even wanted to . She was too old-fashioned about sex or maybe just a prude , or maybe just a good girl but she had n't done anything wrong . She 'd never been touched down there by a boy . Would n't she know it if she had ? Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She could n't . It was n't physically possible . She was a good kid , the best . Everybody 's friend at school . Kathleen Beavier was a virgin . She 'd never had sexual intercourse . But she was pregnant .
