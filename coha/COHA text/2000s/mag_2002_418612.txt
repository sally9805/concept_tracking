The Cold War The ongoing achievement of Alexander Yakovlev <p> This summer they were carrying out restoration work in the basement of the Russian Supreme Court in Moscow , and discovered down there a number of skeletons from Stalin 's day . In a courthouse . Imagine it . These were men and women on whom the death sentence had just been passed ; they were hurried downstairs , shot in the back of the head , and shoved into a cellar to rot . Also this summer , workmen at the Vasilyansky monastery , near Zhovkva in Ukraine , happened to dig up 225 bodies of victims also shot in the back of the head . Acting on a survivor 's tip , the Russians have also been digging on the Zhevsky artillery range , northeast of St. Petersburg . Tens of thousands of victims are believed to lie in random trenches there , men and women arrested and never heard of again . In the nearby village of Levashyovo alone there 's a mass grave of 24,000 . Helplessness in the face of injustice and horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shots , screams , and afterwards the cover-up , the lying . Imagine it . <p> Andrei Sakharov , the celebrated nuclear physicist turned dissident , was instrumental in founding Memorial , a voluntary association dedicated to rehabilitating the victims of Soviet Communism , estimated to be about 60 million people , or the entire population of Britain today . Memorial aims not to punish , but to keep the record . Commenting on the grisly discoveries on the Zhevsky artillery range , Irina Flige , a Memorial official , said that failure to have a full accounting of the crimes committed under Stalin reverberates through Russian society today . <p> Memorial operates under the aegis of the Presidential Commission for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression  --  which is headed by Alexander Yakovlev , as extraordinary a man in his way as Sakharov . Born in 1923 into a peasant family , he grew up on a collective farm near Yaroslavl . In the war , he was badly wounded . Soon after the end of the war , still on crutches , he watched the trains passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces at the windows . And on the platform , women weeping and wailing . " Freed prisoners of war , these were Red Army soldiers being transported straight to Gulag because Stalin suspected that they were potential traitors . Imagine it . Yakovlev speaks of his total incomprehension at the scene . Later he himself had a close call when someone wrote an anonymous letter denouncing him for being insufficiently severe in persecuting Jews . Stalin then died , policy changed , and a letter in the same handwriting reached the authorities to accuse him of being too harsh to Jews . <p> Nonetheless he was a believing Communist . Clever , industrious , capable , he rose through the party 's ranks to become head of the Central Committee 's Department of Propaganda , responsible for the spread of Communist ideology . Under Brezhnev he wrote reports displaying independence of mind , and therefore was packed off to be Soviet ambassador to Canada . Spotting him as the best available promoter of glasnost and perestroika  --  the new openness and reform that were designed to perfect Communism but ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politburo . In charge of special commissions of inquiry into such fraught subjects as the murder of Stalin 's supposed friend Sergei Kirov in 1934 , and the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939 , he had , and still has , access to some archives  --  including Stalin 's papers  --  that are closed to all but a few . <p> Gorbachev has almost completely vanished , but Yakovlev has become a grand old man on Moscow 's political scene . Over the years plenty of Communists have broken with the party , and dissidents from Solzhenitsyn downward have spelled out the party 's crimes . The facts were known to anyone willing to listen . But never before has someone from within the ruling Politburo come clean and described Communism as a criminal enterprise from first to last , aimed against Russia and against humanity itself . Tremendous passion drives him , the fury of a man who let himself be duped and must publish the truth to recover his self-respect . For some time he has wanted to bring to justice those responsible for what he calls " fascist-Bolshevik ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sentenced , but today in Russia tens of thousands of the men who ran Gulag are at liberty and enjoying state pensions . Nobody else of his stature in Russia accepts that right and wrong must remain hopelessly muddled until the guilty are brought to account for Communist crimes , and that the courtroom is the place for such accounting . The quest for truth and justice erupts with explosive force in his book A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia , just published by Yale University Press . <p> Alexander Yakovlev by Roman Genn <p> The years of Communism have molded Yakovlev 's face into inexpressive , almost wooden lines , with deep-set brown eyes that give nothing away . He limps stiffly from his war wound . He talks in a low , gruff voice as he describes the party and the KGB as Siamese twins , partners in crime . <p> The archives prove him right . Lenin  --  consistently praised as one of the great men of the century  --  was in reality a primitive mass-murderer . Time and again Yakovlev is able to quote orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasitism will be shot . " " Merciless war against the kulaks ! Death to the kulaks ! " " The more representatives of the reactionary clergy we shoot , the better . " In 1919 Lenin was instructing the secret police that everyone who did not turn up to work on a particular religious holiday should be shot . Stalin was his worthy pupil , says Yakovlev , " in his hatred and his taste for blood . " Between the two of them , they destroyed the nation 's gene pool , " consciously undermining the potential for the flowering of science and culture . " A slave mentality , Yakovlev says bitterly , consequently remains ingrained in the national consciousness . <p> Along with the clergy were killed the czar 's family , the aristocracy , intellectuals , peasants by the million , almost the whole officer corps , Jews and Muslims , virtually whole ethnic minorities , and " socially dangerous elements " of every sort and no sort . As a result of one particular decree , Yakovlev writes , the executioner 's bullet " took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the administrator of the Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre , I. Aranovic-Arditi ; the Moscow Philharmonia pianist A. Milikovskaya ; the members of the Moscow Artists Union Ts . Gustav and F. Konnov ; the ' non-union ' painters A. Drevin , A. Berzin , and V. Lipgart ; the Academy publishing house artist N. Dmitrikovsky ; the painter and writer S. Broide ; the film actor T. Kan ; the architect O. Vutke ; the director of the Moscow Soviet 's architectural department , A. Pogosia ; and the professor of church choral music M. Khitrovo-Kramsky , a grandson of Field Marshal Kutuzov . " These are names known only to a handful of specialists . But imagine the sweep of it through Moscow , and the fear . <p> Children over the age of twelve could be executed , while those under three were taken away from parents who had been arrested , never to be seen again . The Commission for Rehabilitation receives letters to this day from people who are searching for their parents . Here is a survivor from the Andokhin family , whose letter is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That autumn , for failing to follow the plan for delivering bread to the state , Father was sentenced to two and a half years in prison . And earlier the same autumn , our mother was sentenced to 10 years because , with the permission of the team leader , she had gathered five pounds ( that 's what the sentence said ) of ears of grain on a field for grazing cattle . The local activists made deliberate efforts to wipe out the whole family They took away from us the alms the small children got begging for ' Christ 's sake ' none of us were able to finish even the elementary classes . " In a detail that speaks volumes about the frenzy released , one secret policeman went so far as to denounce a circus act involving animals , because he thought some guinea pigs had the role of agitators . <p> Yakovlev says that he is often asked whether Stalin knew that he was hacking away at Russia 's intellectual roots . " Not only did he know , " is the answer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the name of the hero in Dostoevsky 's Crime and Punishment , and an ambassador of that name once had the courage to write an " Open Letter to Stalin " blazingly charging him with his crimes and comparing him to Hitler ; the letter was suppressed and only came to public view after the collapse of the Soviet Union . In 1934 Ivan Pavlov , who won the Nobel Prize for his famous researches into reflex reactions , wrote to party officials : " What you are sowing throughout the civilized world is not revolution but fascism , and with enormous success . " His missive , too , was suppressed . <p> There are still some who do n't get the point , and wish that Lenin and Stalin had gone further , and that their methods could be used today . Lenin remains embalmed in his mausoleum near the Kremlin . President Putin has brought back the Soviet national anthem , and he further proposes to bring back the Red Star as Russia 's military emblem on banners and uniforms . " The star is sacred for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our fathers and grandfathers went to battle with the star . " Yuri Luzhkov , mayor of Moscow , wants to restore the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky , the Soviet counterpart to Heinrich Himmler , outside the KGB 's Lubyanka headquarters . These may not be murderous measures , but imagine what they stand for . Imagine it . <p> By David Pryce-Jones <p>
