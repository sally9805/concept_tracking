I woke and wondered if my brother was dead ; gone before I could keep my promise . He 'd been fine last night and was probably fine now , but so many mornings began with new crises , trips to the emergency room , frantic calls to doctors ' homes and the pharmacy , that my dread would n't release its grip until I saw him and knew for sure . I sat up and shut off my alarm seconds before it whined , careful not to wake Nicholas beside me . As the percussion of my pulse lessened in my ears , I strained to listen for a clue . I heard only silence outside my bedroom ; the silence that had become the sound of Todd 's slow death . As my eyes grew accustomed to the dark , I tried to slow my breathing . It was coldin that lingering , high-ceilinged way of old houses . All this expensive , antique beauty was at the cost of some comfort , but it was my brother 's house , not my own , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floorboards , growing slowly bolder , until the radiator groaned , rising to a mournful wail , like lost souls trapped in the walls and floors . When my breathing matched the slow , slumbering rhythm of my lover 's beside me , I pushed back the heavy quilt and slid out of bed . I was prepared for the shock of the cold hardwood floor on my bare feet but surprised yet again by the shock of my stiff , injured ankle bearing weight and grabbed a mahogany bedpost to keep from crumpling . I cursed and held the foot off the floor , feeling the throb of it all the way to my shoulder . Balancing on one leg , I reached for the lamp and examined the old surgical scars , vivid blue in the chilly morning air . I 'd lived here only fourmonths , but I 'd never woken up and not known where I was . So why was it that I had n't danced for over three years and still woke up every morning forgetting the reason why ? " You okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to this morning routine . I nodded , still frozen , waiting for the throb to subside before trying again . " Is it my imagination , or is it getting worse ? " " It 's this bed , " I said , " it 's too high . I miss our little mattress on the floor . " " You 've got to be kidding . I love this bed . " He lay back , stretching out spread-eagle . " I look forward to weekends just so I can be in this bed . " " Hmm . I bet you do . " I grinned . I looked forward to weekends , too , but especially so I could sleep . The deep , safe sleep that came to me only when he was here . I rotated my ankle . " Get back in bed and I 'll massage it , " he offered , propping himself up on one elbow , his thick-lashed eyes , the chambray blue of old denim , playful and teasing . " That 's so sweet , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop there . " " Well , of course not . " We both laughed , and he ran a hand through his soft mess of black curls . " Seriously , " he said with a yawn . " You need me to massage it ? " " I think I 'm okay . " I set my foot down . A couple of plis , a few tendus , a cautious relev , and I could walk normally . I tested this by going to the closet . " Do n't get dressed , " Nicholas said , but I pulled on Todd 's old film school sweatshirt that reached my knees and a pair of his black sweats discarded after his latest weight loss . I 'd always been the skinny one of the family , even before I danced , but these sweats fit perfectly , except that I had to roll them twice to cuff their length . Nicholas watched me dress with such disappointment that I lifted my sweatshirt to give him one last look . The cold air helped make the most of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an appearance of fullness . He laughed . " I 'll be right back , " I said . " I just need to check on Todd . " He nodded . " I love you , Summer . " Something swelled within my rib cage , slow and warm , like bread dough rising . " I love you , too . " I went back to the bed and kissed him . I left the room , my face tingling from the cat-tongue rasp of his unshaven chin . In the hall , the winding stairs creaked under my still stiff , uneven gait as I followed the reassuring aroma of hazelnut coffee to the brass-fixtured kitchen . I found Todd working a crossword puzzle at the kitchen table and knew it would be a rare , calm morning . He was wearing jeans and a thick sweater in a shade of gray that made his skin appear transparent . Arnicia , the nursing student who lived with us and took care of Todd in the mornings , sipped coffee beside him , tapping her manicured red nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the master bedroom stood open , and the shower blasted on in the adjoining bathroom . Just above the water rushing came the humming of a familiar movie theme I could n't quite place . When Todd looked up from the puzzle , the one eye that could still see sparkled as he flashed me his Auschwitz grin . " Morning , " I said . " Just wanted to see if you were still breathing . " " Sure am , little sister , " he said in that voice I hardly recognized since the throat tumor , a deeper , aged distortion of his original voice . I sat down at the table . " Chemo today ? " I asked . He made a face and nodded . " If I 'm allowed . It 's up to my white blood cells . " Last month , when the oncology staff held his treatment because of low white count , Todd took it as a personal rejection . " You 'll make it , " Arnicia assured him , going to the stove to prepare his Cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the almost bald head , the lifeless eye , and leaned my head on his shoulder , sharp under the camouflaging sweater . " I wish I were seven and you were ten again and we were going to make a blanket tent today . " He laughed , a rattle echoing just beneath it . " Oh , God . Not me . All that teenage angst ? I 'd have to come out again . No way . " " Maybe this time you could do it a little less dramatically . " Color snuck into his gaunt cheeks , even after all these years . " Thanks , but no thanks . But we can make a blanket tent any time you want , little sister , " he said , patting my knee . " I just meant " He snatched my hand and squeezed it . There was a hint of fear in the motion , but his voice was calm . " I know . " He smiled . " I know . " The shower stopped , but the humming did not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we laughed . Arnicia 's laughter was musical and her mouth hypnotizing to watch . I envied her smooth , cocoa skin and impeccable nails . No matter how little sleep she ran on , or what horrors unfolded , she looked glamorous and serene . I ran a hand through my still sleep-tangled hair and wondered what I looked like . The phone rang , and Jacob answered it in the master bedroom . He came into the kitchen , an imposing figure even in his bathrobe , toweling his spiky black hair . He held out the cordless phone to Todd . " It 's your grandma Anna , babe . " Todd mouthed the words " Did you talk to her ? " " I said hello . " Jacob refused to whisper . " Say something nice to her , " Todd pleaded . " I 'll be there in a minute . " Jacob pressed the phone against his chest , muffling the receiver . " I ca n't think of anything nice to say to her . And my mother taught me that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He held the phone out again . " I 'll take it in the bedroom , " Todd said . He refused the cordless with a sulk but still paused to kiss Jacob before making his slow , measured way into the bedroom . Jacob listened on the cordless until Todd picked up in the other room . I watched him , his sharp , chiseled features , the tan Mediterranean look of his skin , the hint of a tattoo peeking from under one sleeve of his robe . Although he was tall and thin , almost comically so , there was a hard , severe edge to his appearance . He scowled as he hung up . " What did she want ? " I asked him . " I do n't know , but it sure was n't to talk to me . " " I do n't get it , " I said . " Why is he so nice to her ? " Jacob shrugged . " That 's who he is . " He paused a moment . " But it does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval , still stirring at the stove . " Mmm . That is some mighty bad karma , you all . " Jacob smiled and gave Arnicia a peck on the cheek and a quick grab of the butt . She smacked him with her wooden spoon . He fled from her , laughing , and kissed me on the cheek as well . He was usually gone by this time , off teaching stage combat to the acting majors at the local university , but on chemo days he left his students watching filmed fights and accompanied Todd to the hospital . " Ready to save the youth of America ? " he asked me , pouring himself some coffee . I groaned . " I do n't think I 'm cut out to be a teacher . " He sat across from me at the table . " If you do n't like it , quit . We 've got plenty of money , Summer . You know that . It would be great to have you on call for us all the time . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do it . It was bad enough to be the family member described most frequently by " usedto , " as in " Summer used to be a ballerina , " " Summer used to get fan mail , " " Summer once got reviewed in The New York Times , " as though I was already , at twenty-six , a washed-up old eccentric , a novelty to all the young cousins . But to be kept and sheltered seemed even worse . I could just hear Aunt Marnee saying , " Summer used to be a functioning member of society . " Besides , I should be able to tackle this . I 'd breezed through the teacher certificationmy ballet years giving me an edge over the typically distracted , undisciplined college studentand had landed a job within weeks of applying , teaching English at my own old high school , an easy commute from Dayton , where I 'd returned to help care for my brother . But none of that classwork , including student teaching , prepared me for the grueling reality . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsed full out . " Summer ? " Jacob prodded me . " No thanks , " I said . " I want to work . " I flexed my ankle under the table . " But I wish I could do something . . . special again , something people notice , not just behind a closed door where nobody knows or cares because I 'm just doing what every adult in the building can do better than I can . " Jacob leaned back in his chair , putting his bare feet on the edge of the table . I reached across and squeezed his toes , seeking some playful comfort . Looking only at his toes , I said , " I used to define myself by what I did . I could say , ' I 'm a dancer . ' But I never say , ' I 'm a teacher . ' I always say , ' I teach high school right now , ' like it 's some sort of temporary job . " " Well , it is , is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " you think I defined myself as a bartender all those years in L.A ? " I let go of his feet . " That 's not the same . You knew you wanted to act . And you were an actor , even if you paid the rent some other way for a while . I just wish I could get my life together like Todd did , you know ? " Jacob laughed . " That was survival , baby . If he was going to keep you all from getting shipped off to foster homes , he had to get his shit together . " I blinked . I did n't know Jacob knew that story . But , of course , Todd would have told him . " We were never really in danger of foster homes , " I said . " Not with Grandma Anna there . " " Thanks to Todd , " Jacob insisted . I thought about that . " It should n't have been that way . Abby was the oldest . " He snorted . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sister did n't get her shit together . " No . She had n't . When Mom and Dad took off , Abby opted to go on her overnight cheerleading trip as planned , rather than draw attention to trouble at home . Todd , only in seventh grade at the time , skipped a hockey tournament so I would n't be left on the farm alone . Grandma Anna was off feeding the homeless in Cleveland with her church group that weekend . Todd kept me and the horses fed , and the people who boarded horses at our farm from knowing anything was amiss . Our electricity was shut off ; money , as usual , being the root of Mom and Dad 's argument in the first place . The darkness slapped the two of us like a sodden horse blanket during our peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich dinner , and for two nights I followed Todd stall to stall with a flashlight as he double-checked latches and refilled water buckets . We read stories together by candlelight and slept in a blanket tent in the living room to combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our parents just up and leaving was no big deal . It was usually Mom . Dad was always sort of gone , even when he was home . But they 'd never both left us before . We found out later that neither realized the other had left as well . They insisted that they 'd never meant to abandon us , only each other . Mom never left again after that , although I sometimes wished she had . Jacob leaned toward me across the table . " Hello ? You in there ? " I shook myself back to the here and now . " Yeah . I just wish I knew what I wanted . " Jacob sipped his coffee and studied me . " What you want , " he said , " is to prove something . I just ca n't figure out what or why . " " I 'm not trying to prove anything . It 's justI feel like I had this great example , this role model , but I still ca n't get it myself . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strong because he was older , but here I am , way past the age he got his life together , and I do n't know shit . " Jacob pulled his feet back , stood , and dumped his coffee in the sink . He turned and squinted at me . " I really hate it when you talk about him in the past tense . " Arnicia set Todd 's cereal aside and poured herself more coffee , clucking her tongue . " I 'm going outside to smoke , " Jacob said , leaving in his bare feet and robe . He let the back door slam . No one smoked in the house anymore . Todd came out of his bedroom , grinning , but it faded as he looked at us . " Whoa . Bad vibes . What 's going on ? " Arnicia handed him his bowl and said , " Just Summer and Jake doing that love-hate dance again . " Todd rolled his eyes and sat down . Arnicia popped the tab on a can of vanilla Ensure and poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot cereal . Todd shook his head , chuckling . " I ca n't stand this stuff , " he said . " Really ? " Arnicia asked . She took a sip from the can . " Mmm . I like it . " She patted her hips . " Not that I need it . " " So , what did Grandma want ? " I asked . Todd smiled and said , " Get this , " making sure Arnicia was listening as well . " There 's some talk show on this afternoon , where the guest is going to be this woman who 's been ' cured ' of her homosexuality and she 's on a rescue mission to save the rest of us from hell . " He cleared his throat and added , " Grandma wanted me to know the time and station . " Arnicia laughed , a lovely melody that I could n't join . " God , I hate when she does this shit to you , " I said . " Summer , " Todd said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tactful word . " Evil ? " I offered . He sighed and shook his head . " So , what 'd you say to her ? " I asked . " I thanked her for letting me know but told her that was n't the cure I was interested in . " " I do n't know how you do it , " I said . Todd shrugged and began to eat . Arnicia sat back down at the table , looked at her watch , and asked me , " Where 's that man of yours ? " " Still in bed . " " Then what are you doing down here ? If I had a man like that , I 'd never get out of bed . " " Amen , " Todd agreed . " We ca n't stay in bed all the time , " I said , grinning . " But I noticed , " Todd said , " that you did manage to spend most of the weekend there . " " Hey , I only get two days a week until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nicholas was stage-managing a show at the Cincinnati Playhouse-in-the-Park that had turned into a technical nightmare . " Rehearsals are really kicking in , so he ca n't get away as much . " It had been difficult for him to get here at all this week . He 'd been paged from the theater twelve times yesterday alone . I stood and kissed the top of Todd 's head . " I 've got ta get ready for work . I 'll see you later . " He paused and looked over his thin , wasted body , as if taking inventory . " Yes , " he said finally , " today , I think you will . " Laughing , I left the kitchen . I climbed the stairs to my room , eager to return to Nicholas . He was up , wearing the dark blue silk robe I 'd given him for his birthday , just leaving the bedroom as I was coming in . I was literally swept off my feet as he pulled and I pushed the door , both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stumbled forward , and he caught me . We kissed . " How 's Todd ? " he asked , pressing his forehead to mine . " He 's good today . " " And how are you ? " " Wonderful , now , " I said , kissing him again . Strands of my long , red blond hair stood out like embroidery on his robe . He picked me up and carried me to the bed . I waited until he was lying across me to say , " I 'll be late to school . . . . " I began , as usual , with too much urgency , desperate in my attempt to store the heat his lips sparked on my skin , the rich , morning musk rising from us both , the safe haven of our familiar rhythm , trying to hoard every detail to get me through the days without him . And , as usual , he was so generous , so delighted and present , that I forgot myself . I forgot everything except our bodies and how deliciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes as he loved me . I held his face in my hands and pulled it down to my own . It was nearly half an hour later before I hit the shower , reveling in the hot water that finally brought my ankle fully to life . I dressed quickly in clothes that I loathed . I always thought of myself as costumed to teach school ; cast in a role for which I was ill suited . In the mirror , my long navy skirt and ivory sweater set reflected dull good taste and a hint of dowdiness . I twisted my hair into a bun and became a caricature of an old maid librarian , but Mr. Vortee , the principal , would be pleased . He 'd said my jeans and black cowboy boots were not professional enough attire . Neither , he 'd said , were the men 's shirts and ties I 'd borrowed from the closet here at home . And when I 'd bought dresses , they were too short , and he 'd pointed out that I must wear hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place . Of course , Nicholas claimed they all did . " All those poor boys in your classes , " he said , watching me dress , " looking at your dancer legs . " " Ex-dancer , " I said , but the truth was I prided myself on the lean , snatched dancer 's body I 'd maintained with fierce diligence since the injury . " Whatever . You know they 're all in love with you . But none as much as me . " I kissed him good-bye , hating to leave the warm cocoon of the house . Yesterday we had all laughed together with our rented movies and take-out Chinese . The sickness had felt outside the house , looking in . It had held no power over our joy except to make it more precious . Leaving felt wrong ; it fractured our strength , left holes in it , room for things to go bad . But I zipped up my parka , scraped the frost off my car windows , and drove to school . Ohio 's brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare . I felt just as naked the farther I got from the house and the closer I got to Old Mill , the rural town I 'd grown up in , and to the high school I 'd never expected to think of again . I 'd left as one of its most promising graduates , on my way to New York City on a full scholarship to the School of American Ballet . I tried to steel myself for the day , tried to prepare for the glances of pity from my former favorite teachers and the pursed lips of smug glee from some others . I tried to release the resentment I felt at the students who looked through me , past me , who saw me as a nobody , a minor obstacle on their own paths to greatness and glory . I had to find the way to be more again ; I had to find my calling somewhere . I 'd promised Todd he 'd see my other gifts , once I found them . Only then , I had n't known there 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us for two years . For two years he 'd swallowed that secret , after his own body had withheld the information for eight . When he 'd confessed , he 'd admitted to not wanting to worry Mom , already so busy with Grandma 's illness . Our grandma Anna had a brain tumor ; now she and Todd were locked in a grim competition to collect a host of bodily horrors . Nicholas was there the night Todd told us , and I credited him with my surviving the news . A week seemed such an impossibly long time to be without him , just as a school day seemed an impossibly long time to be without Todd . I spent half my waking hours these days watching clocks and calendars . I was n't late to school , but I was running behind enough that all the parking places were taken in the teachers ' lot , and I had to search for a spot way out in the graveled student lot . I parked and picked my way in the rough footing toward the squat , tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A young man materialized at my elbow . " You need a hand ? " I was n't carrying anything but a briefcase . " I 'm fine , Zack , but thanks . " Ever since I 'd choreographed the fall playan abysmal production of A Midsummer Night 's Dream in which he 'd worked on set crewZackery Hauser had been lingering after my class . Last week I 'd received anonymous flowers I suspected were from him . He was nice and attractivein a hungry , gypsy boy sort of wayand his crush amused and even flattered me . I felt sorry for him for having it , but I tried not to be too nice . I 'd been through this last spring when I student taught at Cincinnati 's High School for the Arts and it had snowballed into an embarrassing ordeal I was determined never to repeat . He walked by my side in silence , speaking in a sudden rush as we reached the back door . " Um , Ms. Zwolenick , I was wondering , if I could , you know , talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said as he opened the door for me and the clamor of the pre-homeroom hallways surrounded us . Lockers slammed , the school radio station blared through the intercom , and students called down the crowded hallways to each other . At this time of morning , the halls reminded me of New York . I felt the same agitated claustrophobia that used to accompany my walk from apartment to rehearsal . Zackery hovered while I signed in , checked my mailbox , and headed upstairs to my room . " So , when do you want to meet ? " I asked him . " It 's almost time for homeroom . Will it take long ? You wan na talk now ? " He blushed and opened his mouth to speak , when a girl with an unnaturally orange , salon tan stepped forward . She 'd been waiting outside my classroom . " Ms. Zwolenick , " she said , " I want to talk to you about that pop quiz Friday ? " " Hang on , Amber , " I said . " Zack wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backing away . " No , that 's okay . We can set up some other time . " Before I could answer , he turned and trotted back down the stairs . Amber stood in my doorway , blocking my path . " I do n't think I should 've had to take the quiz , since I 'd been on vacation " " Amber , I told you to have the book read by the time you came back . " " That 's not fair , " she said , pouting away . Later , another girl cried at her C+ when I passed back some tests , her tears offending the generosity I 'd extended . " It 's just not fair , " she sobbed in the hallway after the bell rang . I 'd been heading for the phone in the lounge to find out if Todd had been permitted to proceed with chemotherapy and found myself confronted by her streaked makeup . Oh , for the days when a C+ had the power to break me . I wanted to shake her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that required real tears . She was escorted away by comforting friends . During lunch , before I could even leave my room for the phone , a cocky sophomore announced , " I need to take the makeup test . " " You only get to make up work if you have an excused absence . " " I was sick . " It was hard not to haul off and break his jaw for that one . When I would n't budge , he kicked my trash can on his way out the door , muttering , " That 's real fair . " I had put up a quote that day that I knew they did n't understand . I always wrote a quote of the day on my chalkboard . The quotes were mostly given to me by my brother , who had collected and written them on the memo board in our parents ' kitchen when we were kids . I kept a big notebook in my file cabinet crammed with little pieces of paper , postcards , and letters he 'd sent to me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . Today I picked a postcard from Grenoble , France , and wrote , " Travel light and you can sing in the robber 's face . " Juvenal . Travel light . My father had told us that was the secret to life . I had n't understood it . At one time I thought he said it to mock me as I piled our horse trailer high with my belongings to move to New York . And I had n't always realized who the robber was . I did now . My students did n't , and I despised them for that . That was what was n't fair , though . How could they know ? I wished there was a way , a shortcut , to teach them . Some way besides the one that drowned a person in grief , bloated with sorrow , because I could n't bring myself to wish that lesson on anyone else . Where were the Cliff Notes for impending loss ? In the lounge , when I finally dialed the hospitala number I now knew as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect me to the right oncology desk . I gave up and called home . No answer . That was a good sign ; at least he had n't been sent home right away . I called my parents ' house . No answer there , either . My grandmother rarely left the house anymore . Had something happened to her ? Or . . . had something gone wrong with Todd ? I could n't find anyone anywhere and left a series of desperate messages on every answering machine . The bell rang , and I had n't eaten any of my lunch , much less made it to the bathroom . I headed for my afternoon class , and there stood Zackery Hauser outside my door . When he saw me approaching , red splotches broke out on his neck . " Ms. Zwolenick , I really have to talk to you . " The tardy bell rang . " Can it wait until after class ? " " Well , it 's actually about class . How we 're reading the poems today , and , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaded on his upper lip . He cleared his throat . " It 's , um , really personal , and I do n't . . . want anyone to read it but you . " Oh , brother . I could n't wait to tell Nicholas that his theories about my boys in class were right . " Sure , no problem , " I said . " And , " Zack went on , " I wanted to tell you , you know , before you maybe called on me , and I 'd have to say in front of the class , that , you know , I could n't read it . " " Okay . " This sweating , stammering wreck before me was the school 's top debater , normally an articulate asset to any class discussion . " And I want to talk to you . . . about my poem . II 'd like to know what you . . . how you . . . you know , feel about it . " The splotches deepened to a miserable shade of burgundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " His brown eyes widened , grateful . " Thanks , Ms. Zwolenick . " He handed me the manila envelope , and we both went in to class . It was difficult to concentrate as a few volunteers read poems with Zackery blushing every time we made eye contact , and Denny Robillard , a kid I swear belonged in the Hitler Youth , snickering in the back of the room . Policing Denny exhausted me . I 'd long sensed his antagonism but had never understood it until the day I 'd seen the word Faggotspelled F-a-g-i-t ; the cretin could n't even spell the object of his hatred correctlypenned into his desk . Old Mill was a small town after all , and I could n't expect that no one knew about Todd . I ran for the phone at the end of the day . The same confused receptionist picked up at the hospital . " Can you at least tell me if he had chemotherapy today ? " I asked her . " Well . . . just a minute . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her ask someone . She mispronounced our name . " Oh ! " she said , sounding pleased with herself . " His treatment was delayed . " " Why ? What was wrong ? " This time I had to listen to Christmas carols on the line . It was n't even Thanksgiving yet . After a carol and a half , while the school halls quieted and the parking lot slowly emptied , she said , less brightly this time , " Okay . He had to go to X-ray . " I took a deep breath . " Why ? What are they x-raying ? Is it his lungs like last time ? " She sighed . The carols started again , then stopped . I 'd been cut off . Rather than dial again , I hung up , imagining myself slamming the receiver into the receptionist 's head . I was sick of waiting . Waiting for this conniving virus to marinate itself in Todd 's cells , waiting for those first signs , the first infections , waiting for the official day the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , now , waiting for the inevitable . I had to wait for a lot of things , but I was n't about to wait for her . I ran to my lone car in the parking lot , head bent against the bitter wind .
