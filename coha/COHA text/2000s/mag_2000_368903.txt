Big news out of Florida last week . Scientists said they plan to release killer flies that will inject eggs into the bodies of pesky fire ants , and the eggs will hatch maggots that eat the heads of the ants . No word on whether this can be used to curb the recent infestation of attorneys . <P> Trial lawyers marched on Florida by the hundreds in the days after the election , responding to a flurry of e-mails calling all good soldiers to the front lines . So much was at stake . The presidency . The republic . The protection the trial lawyers had paid for with huge campaign contributions . <P> Thirty attended one hearing ; 50 squeezed into another . By early last week , Theresa LePore , the designer of the infamous butterfly ballot in Palm Beach County , had been sued no fewer than 12 times . <P> All right , so the ballot might not have been Madame Butterfly 's best work . " But Theresa 's not the story , " argued her attorney , Bruce Rogow of Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscled and literally screamed at by attorneys and Democratic Party chiefs who were more concerned with getting Gore elected or feeding their own egos than using the law as a tool of justice . And some were in way over their head . " I got a call from one attorney who wanted to file an injunction but had never done it , " Rogow said . " I told him if he was too stupid to know what an injunction looked like , he was too stupid to be involved in this fray . " <P> Rogow , a scholarly , bow-tied law professor who has argued 11 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court , said the word circus was n't big enough to describe the show . At one point attorney Alan Dershowitz , the Zelig of American law , and another lawyer attended a hearing with Rogow , and the New York Times observed : " In a race that was not particularly close , both men beat the lead defense lawyer , Bruce S. Rogow , to the television cameras outside the courthouse . " <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Rogow , who believes nothing short of a methadone-type program can save his brethren . He thinks a dozen attorneys are arguing two or three vital legal issues with style and class . But battalions of " confused lawyers are representing confused voters " in partisan sideshows that muddle everything . <P> Not that it was n't entertaining . At least once a day , Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris modeled something from Chanel or Mrs. Howell 's Gilligan 's Island collection . Harris , a supporter of Governor George W. Bush , would issue a totally nonpoliticized ruling favoring Bush , and then Florida attorney general Bob Butterworth , who chaired Vice President Al Gore 's state campaign , would issue a totally nonpoliticized response favoring Gore . <P> It would n't have been this embarrassing if Bush and Gore had insisted on more restraint . " It 's a free-for-all , " Rogow said , and one day in his office , the incoming calls backed him up . Dershowitz was on Line 1 , and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher , a Gore point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply some muscle .
