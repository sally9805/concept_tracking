In the middle of the night <p> Jaywalker is dreaming when the ringing of his phone jars him awake . Something about hiking with his wife in the Canadian Rockies . He understands right away it has to have been a dream , because his wife has been dead for nearly ten years now , and he has n't hiked the Rockies in twice that long . <p> Groping in the darkness for the phone , his first fear is for his daughter . Is she out driving ? Riding with some pimply-faced boyfriend who 's had his learner 's permit for two weeks now and thinks of driving as some sort of video game ? Then he remembers . His daughter is in her early thirties . She has a husband with no pimples , a child of her own , a career , and a house in New Jersey . <p> " Hello ? " Jaywalker says into the phone , then holds his breath and readies himself for the worst . The clock radio next to the phone glows 3:17 . <p> " Pete ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " says Jaywalker , " that you may have dialed the wrong number . What number were you trying to  --  " <p> The line goes dead . No " Sorry , " no " Oops . " Just a click , followed by silence and eventually a dial tone . <p> Jaywalker recradles the phone . He lies on his back in the dark , feeling his pulse pounding in his temples . Relief and annoyance duel for his attention , but only briefly . For already , Jaywalker is elsewhere . He 's lying in bed in the dark , to be sure , but somehow his hair is brown instead of gray , his face less lined , his body more muscular . And his wife lies beside him , her warm body pressed against his back . <p> " Who was it ? " she asks him . <p> " A mother , " he says . " A mother whose son has just been arrested . A rape case . And it sounds like a bad one . " <p> " For them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one for you , right ? " <p> " Right , " agrees Jaywalker . He 's not yet thirty , this younger version of him . He 's been out of Legal Aid for a little over a year now , struggling to build a practice on his own . And struggling is definitely the operative word here . So he knows his wife is right : what 's bad for the young man and his family is at the same time good for the lawyer and his . One of the strange paradoxes of criminal law that Jaywalker will never quite get comfortable with : that his earning a living is dependent upon the suffering of others . <p> What this younger Jaywalker does n't know , what he has absolutely no way of knowing at this point , as he lies in the dark , is that this new case will be different , that it will mark a crossroads in his career and in his life . Should he live to be a hundred , no case that will ever come his way will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's done with it , and it with him , it will change him in ways that will be as profound as they are unimaginable . It will transform him , molding him and pounding him and shaping him into the lawyer and the man he is today , almost thirty years later . So this is more than just the case he 'll forever wake up to when the phone rings in the middle of the night . This is the case that he 'll retry in his mind over and over again for the rest of his days , changing a phrase here , adding a word there , tweaking his summation for the hundredth  --  no , the thousandth  --  time . And long after he 's grown old and senile and has forgotten the names and faces and details of other cases , this is the one that Jaywalker will remember on his deathbed , as clearly and as vividly as if it began yesterday . <p> No doubt whatsoever <p> That the case had come Jaywalker 's way at 3:17 in the morning , while unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of his home telephone was actually rather typical . Jaywalker had early on developed the habit of giving out his home number liberally . It was but one of many things that distinguished him from his colleagues , who never would have thought of doing such a thing , the functional equivalent of a physician 's house call . Moreover , as technology advanced , with the advent of beepers , pagers , car phones , cell phones and BlackBer-ries , Jaywalker stuck to the practice with characteristic stubbornness , continuing to invite clients and their families to call him at home whenever the need arose . As it had apparently arisen for Inez Kingston on that particular night in September of 1979 . <p> Then , as now , Jaywalker had answered with a fearful " Hello ? " notwithstanding the fact that he knew his daughter was safely in bed upstairs and would n't even be of driving age for another twelve or thirteen years . Whatever the circumstance , there seems to be something about the midnight phone call that inspires instant dread . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " <p> " This is Inez Kingston . You represented my son Darren last year . Maybe you remember . " <p> " Sure , " said Jaywalker . " I remember . " The name did sound familiar , though if pressed , he would have had trouble attaching a face to it , or recalling what the charges had been and how the case had turned out . <p> " I 'm afraid it 's Darren again , " she said . " They 've got him at the precinct . They say he raped some women . They wo n't tell me any more . " <p> " What precinct ? " <p> " The Forty-third . " <p> Jaywalker jotted down Inez 's number in the dark , something he 'd learned to do . Otherwise , brilliant ideas that came to him in the middle of the night had a way of vanishing before morning . Written down on paper , they tended to lose some of their brilliance , but at least they survived . <p> He found the number for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to be somewhere in the Bronx , but other than that , he did n't have a clue . Ninety percent of his practice was in Manhattan , which he liked to think of in sports language as his home court . Of course , at this particular stage of his career , the math was n't all that hard to do : it did n't exactly require a calculator to convert nine out of ten cases into a percentage . <p> He reached the precinct and had the desk officer transfer his call to the squad room . There a detective confirmed that they did indeed have a Darren Kingston locked up . He 'd been booked for five separate rapes and would be making court in the morning . <p> Jaywalker thanked the detective and called Inez back . He told her what he 'd been able to find out , and offered to meet her in court at nine o'clock . Before hanging up , he told her not to worry . Like most people , if you woke Jaywalker up in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him an hour or so , and the continued warmth of his wife 's body pressed up against his own , but he eventually managed to fall back to sleep . He was sure Inez Kingston did n't . <p> He had a car back in those days , Jaywalker did . Or sort of . It was an ancient Volkswagen Beetle , its exterior equal parts blue paint and orange rust . The running boards had fallen off , the heater was history , the wipers stuck when they were n't busy scratching the windshield , and the horn worked if you were lucky enough to happen upon the " sweet spot " of the rim . <p> But it was transportation , something that came in handy when you 'd been forced to flee the city 's rich rents and poor public schools , and move to the suburbs . If Ber-genfield , New Jersey , qualified as a suburb . What it was , was a blue-collar , working-class community , where Jaywalker could mow his own lawn , rake his own leaves and shovel his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his wife hoped for better things , it suited him just fine . <p> Aiming the VW toward the Bronx that following morning , Jaywalker tried to remember what he could about Darren Kingston . He 'd been one of Jaywalker 's first clients after he 'd left Legal Aid . His mother , Inez , worked at what today is referred to as the Department of Social Services . Back then it was the Welfare Department . Progress , no doubt . One of Inez 's coworkers there was Jaywalker 's sister-in-law . It had been at her suggestion that Inez had called Jaywalker when Darren had gotten into trouble . Along with two other young black men , he 'd been arrested for robbing an elderly white man . Although the case had sounded bad at first , it turned out to be pretty harmless . One of the other defendants had done some work for the man and had had a dispute over how much money was owed him . When he went to collect , he brought his friends along . One of his friends being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , had had very little involvement in the matter and had never been in any sort of trouble before , the charges against him had eventually been dropped . <p> This time , Jaywalker thought as he maneuvered around the potholes , trash and broken glass of the South Bronx , he was pretty sure things were n't going to be quite so easy . <p> Arraignments took place in a dark gray building at 161st Street and Washington Avenue , half a block from the abandoned elevated tracks above Third Avenue . It was one of two buildings that together made up the Bronx Criminal Court . Rumor had it that both had been condemned as unsafe since the early 1950s , and in fact they would finally be abandoned a few years later , replaced by a large modern structure closer to the Grand Concourse . <p> At the time , however , the decaying building was , for most people , their first encounter with what passed for Bronx justice . The floors were stained and uneven . Where they were supposed to be tiled , whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , they were splintered and suffering from years of dry rot . The walls were cracked and paint-chipped , and covered with graffiti that was anti-police , anti-white , anti-black , anti-Hispanic , anti-gay , anti-just about everything . The two elevators took turns being out of order . Rather than guessing , Jaywalker headed for the stairwell . Just before entering , he took a deep gulp of air , then breathed through his mouth as he climbed , in order to block out as much of the stench of old urine as he could . <p> Reaching the second floor , he recognized Inez Kingston and her husband , Marlin . She was a short , heavyset woman whose pleasant smile and soft West Indian accent masked an inner nervousness and chronic high blood pressure . He was an equally short , wiry man with a face that wore the two-day-old stubble of a nightshift worker for the Transit Department . As accustomed as Inez was to hiding her feelings , Marlin was not , and his face that Wednesday morning was tense and unsmiling . <p> Jaywalker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her younger brother , who 'd come along for support . Jaywalker asked if anything was new since the night before . <p> " No , " said Inez , " but the detective 's here . Rendell . He wo n't tell us anything , but he did say he 'd talk to you . I told him we had a lawyer coming . Was that all right ? " " Yes , " said Jaywalker . " Where is he now ? " " In there . " She pointed to a door . A sign on it warned passersby to keep out . <p> Complaint Room Police Officers Only <p> " Point him out to me when he comes out , okay ? " <p> It did n't take long . Robert Rendell , all six foot three of him , opened the door and strode out . He was young for a detective , and handsome , with a shock of graying black hair that fell across his forehead . Jaywalker immediately sized him up as a formidable witness . Then he moved to intercept him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rendell ? " <p> " Yup . " <p> " My name is Jaywalker . I 'm going to be representing Darren Kingston . The family said you might be able to give me a little information . They seem pretty confused . " <p> " What can I tell you , counselor ? I 've got five CWs  --  " complaining witnesses , Jaywalker translated mentally "  --  and everything they say points to your man . " <p> " Lineups ? " Jaywalker probed . <p> " You 're going to have to talk to the D.A . " <p> " Jesus , " said Jaywalker , a seriously lapsed Jew . " I 've known this kid for years . " It was an exaggeration , but a modest one . " Shocks the shit outta you . When did these rapes take place ? " <p> " August , mostly . But I 've been looking for him for a couple of weeks . " <p> " Statements ? " <p> " No , nothing really , " said the detective . " Says he 's innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girls coming down this morning . She IDs him , or she does n't . " He shrugged . " If he 's not the guy , I do n't want him . " With that , he excused himself and walked into the courtroom . <p> Jaywalker looked at his watch . It was a few minutes after ten . Court was supposed to begin at 9:30 a.m. , but the judge had n't taken the bench yet . Nothing new there . <p> Jaywalker took a minute to consider what he had . Rendell had n't given him much , but at least he 'd added a few more facts to piece into the picture . There were five victims . At least one of them  --  the one who was on her way to court  --  apparently had n't seen Darren since the incident . Assuming it was Darren . Most of the rapes had occurred in August , a month ago . That could be good . But Rendell 's comment that he 'd been looking for Darren sounded bad . It meant that Darren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigation . It also suggested that Darren might have been hiding out , trying to avoid arrest . Consciousness of guilt ? That there were no admissions was good . If he was guilty , at least Darren had been smart enough to keep his mouth shut . <p> Already Jaywalker could sense things shaping up as a classic identification case . Five women had been raped . Was Darren Kingston the man who had raped them ? <br> Continues ...
