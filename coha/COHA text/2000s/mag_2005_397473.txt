Porn provides windfall profits for Vivid Entertainment and the cable giants that sell its racy fare . Now the government is cracking down for the first time in 20 years . <p> IT IS MIDDAY ON A CLUTTERED movie set in an unassuming office park in a well-manicured neighborhood of Culver City , Calif. , and the crew is getting restless . Penthouse Pet Sunny Leone , in cascades of jet-black hair and black lacy underthings , has taken close to two hours to struggle through three pages of dialogue for her debut film , thwarted by line flubs and interruptions from a noisy generator , rumbling trucks and the roar of planes passing overhead . <p> " I forgot my line already , " she giggles as the camera stops yet again . " Thank you , Jesus , " a crew member says when the actress finally nails it . " Can I get an ' Amen ' ? " she says good-naturedly . By the time she begins her first make-out scene , late in the day , her moans of pleasure as fake as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski lodge , the crew is too bored to betray much interest . Other performers wander around in various stages of undress , barely meriting a glance . <p> This is business as usual on the set of Vivid Entertainment in Los Angeles , the nation 's largest producer of video pornography . Privately held , it claims annual revenue of $100 million . Quite possibly half that sum falls to the bottom line . Filmed in three days at a cost of $50,000 , the 85-minute Sunny will likely produce total retail revenue of $5 million , much of it spread among Vivid 's " white-collar " partners  --  cable systems owned by Comcast , Time Warner and others , the DirecTV satellite service and hotel networks . <p> " I feel like this company is bubbling to the surface and will explode , " says Vivid Chief Steven Hirsch , who cofounded it in 1984 on $20,000 , much of it borrowed , and still owns it with two partners . Vivid makes some 60 films a year and releases 30 compilation discs a month . Hirsch now licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Las Vegas night club , virility-enhancement concoctions , X-rated comic books and even a set of custom car wheels . He flirts with the idea of taking the company public in a few years . ( So far New Frontier Media and Private Media Group are the only publicly held firms in hard-core , both of them mediocre performers . ) <p> " This is a business , and we treat it like a business , " says Hirsch , 44 , whose obsessively neat office sits across the 101 freeway from General Electric 's Universal Studios and displays a wall of plasma screens tuned to financial news , sports and dozens of security-camera feeds . His partner , William Asher , who holds diplomas from Dartmouth and the University of Southern California , says Vivid could reap riches on new outlets such as cell phones and iPods . " Adult is almost too good to be true , " he says . <p> But the feds are now mounting the biggest attack on porn since the Reagan Administration 20 years ago . Congress is trying to legislate new curbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , racking up 40 obscenity convictions since 2001 . That compares with just four in all eight years of the Clinton Administration . <p> " These are dangerous , scary times , " Hirsch intones . " At the same time , there 's been an explosion of technology and delivery platforms , so there 's a disconnect with the morality police . Ultimately I believe juries understand people have the right to watch what they want to watch . " <p> Not if Philip Burress can help it . His Citizens for Community Values , formed in 1983 in Cincinnati , has made life miserable for strip clubs and other adult businesses in the area . In Washington he met with Alberto Gonzalez a few months after Gonzalez became attorney general , to urge him to crack down on the hotel pay-per-view outfits and the satellite and cable firms that reap porn profits . " I 've made it clear to him we wo n't make a dent in the campaign until they go after the white-collar pornographers , " Burress says . <p> The Justice Department 's antiporn budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOJ has kept a low profile on the issue since recent reports brought ridicule in the press for misplaced priorities . " It 's time to confront the real terror threat  --  porn , " sneered one headline . <p> In Congress , a porn crackdown gives Democrats a chance to grab on to a red-state issue . In July a group of congressional Democrats proposed the Internet Safety &; Child Protection Act of 2005 , which would require age-checking software for all porn sites and impose a 25% excise tax on Internet porn . Children now first see porn at age 11 , the bill 's backers announced , repeating a claim that turns out to be baseless ( see related story at Forbes.com ) . <p> In September an amendment to a porn bill sought to extend onerous recordkeeping rules to even the fake sex scenes in many Hollywood films and TV shows . The rules are intended to ensure that all performers are 18 or older , and the new measure would subject studios that fail to comply to criminal prosecution . <p> For now the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and porn distributors for shipping naughty goods across state lines . In New York adult outlets are fighting in court to preserve a loophole that lets them continue to thrive despite tough zoning restrictions that were supposed to wipe many of them out . <p> Government has found it even more difficult to tackle Internet pornographers who distribute via broadband , often from Russia or eastern Europe . Even domestic vendors are difficult targets . The feds just lost a case against Extreme Associates , whose graphic films of fictionalized rape make Vivid look like Disney . <p> A U.S. District Court judge in Pittsburgh threw out the ten-count indictment in January , declaring obscenity statutes unconstitutional because they do n't let people view porn in the privacy of their own homes . Extreme Associates now cheekily markets " The Federal Five " movies that were singled out by the government , which is appealing the ruling to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia . The Bush Administration says if the decision stands , it will undermine obscenity laws and " laws against prostitution , bestiality and bigamy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and free speech was defined by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Miller v. California , which cited the importance of community standards and applied the LAPS test . Porn was illegal when it was sexually explicit and utterly lacking in " literary , artistic , political or scientific value . " The Internet has upended all of that . " It used to be easy to define a community because there were just adult theaters and bookstores , " says Hirsch . " Now the Internet breaks down community standards . Is n't that what the First Amendment is about , the right to privacy ? " <p> Hirsch hopes the Internet and its effects on community standards will keep him in business and curtail the next wave of federal prosecutions . Vivid last faced charges 16 years ago , when it got into trouble for sending a movie across state lines to a customer in Oxford , Miss . who turned out to be a postal inspector ; Hirsch paid a $500,000 fine . <p> When he started in 1984 , Hirsch 's inspiration was to reinvent , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , mining for talent , investing in turning the new star into a bona fide brand and locking her in to make and promote more films . Hirsch 's most successful star by far is Jenna Jameson , a buxom one-woman porn factory whose movies sell upward of 50,000 copies at $50 apiece and who has licensed her name for a line of sex toys , action figures and cell phone ring-tone moans . <p> Sunny Leone , the rookie on the ski-lodge set , does n't rate such treatment yet  --  she will be paid $20,000 or so for her two scenes . " Loud , Sunny , get loud for us , " purrs the director , who goes by the phony name " B. Skow , " as the cameraman contorts himself to get as close as possible to the action . " Yeah , that 's the way I like it . " <p> Vivid 's distributors played no role in making Sunny but will reap much of the upside : sales of , say , 20,000 DVDs at $12 to $15 a pop wholesale ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold for $30 to $40 at retail ; up to $1.5 million in revenue for pay-per-view on cable systems and on DirecTV ( each of which typically pockets up to a 90% cut ) ; and several hundred thousand dollars more from viewings in hotel rooms ( which is why , on the Sunny set the other day , a second , soft-core camera simultaneously shot the same nude scenes from the waist up ) . <p> At some point the new film will air on a Playboy-owned channel . Hugh Hefner 's company paid Vivid $70 million in 2001 to acquire the Spice networks , hard-core pay channels that Playboy now programs with Vivid 's explicit movies . Also , Vivid will resell Sunny in compilation DVDs as her library of performances builds . It also sells phone-sex ads that appear at the start of each DVD ( spots that , it turns out , are impossible to skip ) . And it will add Sunny to the offerings on its Web site , vivid.com , with tens of thousands of subscribers paying $30 a month for access and unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin beaming out cell phone videos in the U.S. in the next few months and to keep a much bigger share of the loot than the meager 10% it gets from the cable industry . <p> " The numbers on our cell phone business are just phenomenal , " Asher says  --  already at $10 million ( in retail ) a year in Europe . <p> Hirsch vows to continue pushing porn despite the growing crackdown on obscenity . As he sees it , he 's only guilty of giving customers what they want . " These moral crusaders are hiding behind the facade of protecting children , when their real agenda is to get rid of any forms of adult material , " he says . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Lights , camera , moan !
