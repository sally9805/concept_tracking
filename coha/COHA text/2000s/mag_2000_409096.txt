Viking 's svelte new 65 Convertible pays for her own coming-out party with a big tournament win . // Is it possible for a boat to smirk ? OK , maybe she was just smiling shyly . Anthropomorphic nonsense aside , I did get the feeling that all of the other boats , lined up silently in their slips , were paying some sort of obeisance to this Viking 65 as she rumbled by . It was the day after Dickie Weber 's MidAtlantic $500,000 tournament and Miss Priss here had just snatched the winner 's check for $246,375 . Not bad for a debut . The tournament was a major coup for Viking Yachts in general . The New Gretna , New Jersey , builder 's boats had taken all three places in the white marlin division , second place in the blue marlin category , and added another first for the heaviest tuna . No wonder , then , that Capt . Don Gommell and Mate Dave Wilson ( son of the 65 's designer , Bruce Wilson ) carried the contented air of successful gladiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me be the first to tell you that conditions here can go from very welcome to Hell in a handbasket overnight . Which they had done . A front had come through on the night before the final day and the heavy seas the next morning turned back almost half the fleet . But not the 65 . The Hudson Canyon , you see , where the big fish hang around like thugs at a prize right , is way offshore . The tournament places a 125-mile limit , but you get the picture : it 's a long hard slog out and back . Typically , you leave the dock around 4:30 to make the 8:30 start . Photograph Photograph // As we slid out of the Canyon Club and headed into a moming calm , it was difficult to reconcile this benign ocean with that of two days before . A chilling reminder was the monotone of a Coast Guardsman broadcasting a plea for all vessels in the vicinity to aid in search and rescue regarding a missing 23-foot boat with three Atlantic City men aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much hope for the others . Against this panoply of smashing success and doleful sorrow , we headed up the coast for the mouth of the Mullica River , thence to turn into the Bass River and bring the new queen home to the subjects who had built her at the Viking plant . Fortunately , or unfortunately ( I 'm still ambivalent ) , I had not been able to fish that turbulent Friday , so this was my chance to see how she behaved . We crossed the wake of a 40-something-foot yacht . Not even a little bumpbump . There are times when it pays to be big and heavy . Crank the wheel , she responds quickly and smoothly . Firewall the throttles . Wow ! At 2350 rpm , she is showing 39.2 knots on the GPS . Make that big , heavy and fast . Cruise , at 2000 and change , is 34.5 knots . She is a Viking , with all that that implies . Photograph AT YOUR SERVICE : Heim station is compact and highly functional . // For more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Viking yachts . I 've watched brothers Bill and Bob Healey mold this company into a world-class builder . Bill , the former bantamweight Marine Corps pugilist , is famous for his high engineering standards ( and short fuse with incompetence ) . Bob , the money guy , has kept the wolves at bay . Between them , they have earned respect where it counts most : on the docks . They had lots of help , of course , from people like the aforementioned Bruce Wilson , from Tom Carroll , who now runs Viking Sports Cruisers and a veritable host of others . Let us not leave out Roger Penske who stepped in with a quick loan when the late and unlamented luxury tax almost killed the boat business and reduced Viking 's work force from 900 or so to fewer than 40 . Now the company is bigger and better than ever . And , now it is the kids ' turn .

CAFE , OLE ! No food at your feet with slide-out fridge and freezer . BEDROOM AYES : Elegance is the key word in all of the staterooms . // continue to advance , but the big change is stylistic . They dumped the spastic sea serpent logo long ago and now the boxy houses and stubby hulls are evolving into sleek seducers more at Merritt or Rybovich than Harker 's Island . The 65 is a wonderful example , although I think that the absence of railings along the side decks and on the bows is a potentially dangerous esthetic conceit . Sure , it looks cleaner , but what if you have to work that foredeck in a seaway ? This is an owner 's choice-and this 65 did have some rails forward-but I would opt for the full monty . It is amazing how much more of a boat-exponentially so-a 65 is than , say , a boat five feet shorter . On the Vike 65 , the bridge is simply huge . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 100,000plus option . Forward of the helm console is an area that could contain a small party , and even includes a large stowage freezer in addition to a sink/freshwater washdown and a drinks cooler . The console itself is handsome , with all electronics arrayed conveniently . Under the console is a large stowage space that also gives access to the instruments . A few changes My complaints are threefold : the helm seat needs a footrest molded into the console ; the ladder hatch should have a rail just forward of it Oust in case ) ; and the skipper has no view of cockpit and angler when he 's at the controls . True , this boat won a major tournament , but with less experienced anglers the captain needs to see more than just the tip of the rod . The cockpit is the result of years of hard fishing and the wisdom thus acquired . It is uncluttered and there are three steps up to the salon-to keep seawater off the carpet when backing down on a big one . The coaming on this boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of anglers like to fish 50-lb. stand-up on most species . Bait freezer , sink , tackle drawers are all molded in . On one 65 currently coming down the production line , a bench seat has been molded in above this . Nice for watching baits from the shade of the overhang . Nice lazarette amidships at the after end of the dance floor , and flanking this are two options you see more and more of- a deep live well and an insulated fish box with built-in ice maker . There is another recirculating live well in the transom . I 'm not sure you could get a grander in through the transom door , but you should release those big ladies anyway . The engine room is reached through a hatch between the freezer/cooler and the salon door . The ER may seem small at a glance , but it is packed with gear and there is good access to all sides of the engines without too much contortion . ( Note to self . check these damned things out in the morning before they crank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salon has a large U-shaped settee with hi-lo table facing an entertainment center hidden behind gorgeous wooden panels . It is the galley that deserves special kudos . It is the traditional sportfishing U , meaning you can wedge yourself in while fixing lunch at sea , but the fridge and freezer make you mutter to yourself Why did n't somebody think of this years ago ? They are contained in six large , deep drawers under the Corian counter . No more opening a standard refrigerator and having the beer and bologna and the okra and tomatoes tumble out on your feet . Cabinets over the three-burner Kenyon electric range also have racks on rollers for easy access and to prevent spills . The galley sole is teak and holly . Abundant stowage Stowage is abundant and everywhere : under the settee , under the dinette ( which will seat four to five overstuffed anglers or lots of kids ) and behind the galley bulkhead . Immediately to port as you descend four steps into the companionway , there are three more steps taking you steeply into a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker , and a spacious head . There are no hatches or portlights , of course . It is too deep into the hull . This space clearly was intended as crew quarters or a hideaway for your petulant teenaged son . Another small cabin is to starboard , just forward of the washer/dryer . This also has over/under berths and a large head that doubles as the day facility . The master stateroom is to port and has a very comfortable double island berth , with bedside tables on either side , two large cedar-lined hanging lockers , vanity , and entertainment center over that . The head is quite nice , too . In all of the heads , by the way , there is more than ample elbow and knee room when you use the potty . Showers have molded-in seats , and the medicine cabinets have fiddles to restrain your traveling pharmacopoeia . All of the heads also have mirrored ceilings , which instantly and magically dispels any sense of claustrophobia . The guest stateroom is forward : island double with easy access on both sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master ) . The head is like the others-an admirable achievement . Another gripe and a note to my pal Billy : we 've been talking about this for years : the hatches in the master and guest staterooms are too small . Large persons such as myself would have difficulty making quick egress in an emergency . In sum , this is a boat you 'd be proud to campaign from Barnegat to Belize , proud to play host to royalty on , a boat you can stand in front of and claim with maybe a smirk of your own . // Viking 65 Convertible // <p>
