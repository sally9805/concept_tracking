Matthew Corradi made his professional debut as a fiction writer with " Journey to Gantica " in this year 's January issue . Now he returns with a dense and rewarding science fiction story . He says this story originated one night when he watched gecko lizards gather on the frosted bathroom window of his Arizona home . At first , he thought they were attracted to the light . Then he realized his assumption was wrong , and that sparked this story . <p> THEY WERE FOUR DAYS OUT from Qidrit with no sign of a kigrin on the vids . The guide drank too much , the airboat 's buoyancy tanks leaked , and the Song of Kido constantly caressed Jax Ridimon 's deepest fears . Maybe Ridimon was making a mistake , maybe his quest was more about suicide than finding a cure , but he did n't care . He was reckless . Toward sunset the alarm went off and the airboat 's neural processor popped up three vid-screens showing broadband movement . On the visible spectrum monitor Ridimon could make out a tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A thrill ran through him as a serpentine body emerged from the waters around a kidaah tree . Wings unfurled , transparent and vein-laced , and then a sleek , diamond head swiveled around and looked directly at the sensor , directly at the camera on the sensor , directly at Ridimon . Ridimon jumped out of his chair and yelled for Phidrik , but Phidrik was already shooting the airboat across the treetops of the Canopy , following the processor 's triangulation . In a matter of seconds Phidrik circled a small seam in the foliage , anchored the airboat , and dropped them through the Canopy in the two-man skiff . But underneath the interlaced treetops , in the mists of the swamp , the kigrin was gone . Phidrik found a tail trace straddled by tracks , and bent fronds , and claw marks in fen-moss . He followed the trace across the mud , sometimes leaning over the prow of the skiff while Ridimon steered , other times hopping from spot to spot , stepping as if weightless across sludge and slime and quick-mire . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heaviness pressed on his chest . Phidrik 's discordant voice faded in and out , and Ridimon turned up the cross-chatter in his earpiece until it hurt , . but still the Song grew and solidified in his mind . More shattered hulls , swimming through decks of melted metal , the blue cold of vacuum , the frost of death . Looking for the officers , for the captain , ' seeing only bodies floating , puffed and cracked , blood drifting . What are the questions1 . Impossible to remember . The voices begin , a scream , a whimper , bitterness and shock , and most of all-regret . They rise to a wail of anguish from the still , purple mouths and icy eyes of murdered men . Ridimon awoke on a cot on the deck of the airboat . Phidrik 's raspy singing accompanied the drone of the ion engines and the erratic ticking of the airboat 's neural processor . Phidrik had brought Ridimon back to the boat and did not question his lapse under the Song 's spell . Fear shot through Ridimon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed me . Dumped my corpse in the swamps . " Phidrik stopped singing and swiveled in his pilot 's chair . A lack of any body hair made his green skin a natural canvas for the spidery tattoos that ran over his skull and down the back of his neck . Ridimon could read nothing in the guide 's flat , black eyes . After a slight delay from the translator implant , Phidrik cracked a smile and said , " Ah , but it 's bad for business to kill off customers , yes ? Besides ... ! like your Song . " " What do you care about my Song ? " " It 's arranged in a whole different key than most , yes ? " Phidrik spoke in native Kido , a slippery language full of blended sibilance that came through even in translation . Ridimon did n't quite trust the cheap dialect interface he had downloaded into his neural translator back in Qidrit . Maybe Phidrik was speaking in analogies , or maybe the translator was having trouble processing into Imperium Standard . Ridimon decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to describe seeking the cure to his curse from a super-sentient alien in the equatorial swamps of a backwater planet in a far forgotten comer of the galaxy ? And hiring this Kido drunk to be his guide and hunter ? Reckless . Phidrik 's airboat was a patchwork of rusting metal eaten away by countless years of swamp fog . The buoyancy tanks were sealed with mismatched salvage panels , and the aft steering fins looked ready to snap off in a slight breeze . Ridimon wondered how the craft continued to float in the empty air above the Canopy . Phidrik occasionally walked the observation deck encircling the upper hull , but mostly he sat in the open pilot 's cabin , analyzing the readings relayed from the large array of sensor poles strategically placed among the breather bogs just south of the Qidrit River . Grid arrays were for pretenders , Phidrik claimed ; kigrin were large creatures , but they could still sneak through broad grids and bypass tight grids . Phidrik preferred to gamble on a combination of acoustic and low-spectrum linear arrays set perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a kigrin was maximized , extended sensor surveillance was limited , and tracking became the skill nf a man reading the swamp rather than vidscreens . Ridimon felt the pull of the Song each time he and Phidrik dropped below the Canopy into the swamps , and it was a struggle to resist . What exactly was the Song ? The absolute locals in Qidrit had laughed at the question . Perhaps it was the blood of the planet coursing through twisted trees , they said , or whimsical swamp spirits teasing gullible souls .... But where there was Song there were kigrin , and legend claimed that the kigrin of Kido held knowledge beyond the comprehension of man . Maybe they even knew of a cure for Ridimon 's curse . Yet knowledge was not without danger , for the Song of Kido sought to lay bare your soul and consume it whole . Toward sunset they dropped down in the skiff again to pull a sensor line . Ridimon held the skiff in place while Phidrik pulled a transmission head off a pole . The warped , twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Canopy , and slick branches with thin , wet leaves hung back down like groping tentacles . It had been such a long time since Ridimon had actually dropped planet-side , so many years in the cold , hard guts of a hyper-c hauler . Here the unfiltered air was too thick ; the moisture in every breath was the collective exhalation of the swamps , dank and enveloping . It was all so alien that , before he could even reach up to adjust the static in his earpiece , Ridimon 's stomach churned and his vision blurred . Tubes sweaty with condensation , the drip of serum , needles , cyclic pumps , worried faces looking down . Then the whispered questions : What is the enemy transport route through Talus field How many frigates , battleships , cruisers What drive speeds , what photomic vectors Destination , raid pattern , target objective Time then , waiting .... Impatience in those faces , and fear , until a grating on the mind like jagged iron , a crack through the brain like the snap of a bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thousand men , a hundred-thousand regrets , countless dreams , joy , laughter , all gone . THE SONG was unique for all individuals , and for the moment Ridimon found his version to be composed of memories ; but the memories were fresh and raw , like filleted nerves . And when Ridimon came to consciousness again the Song lingered painfully in his head . Ridimon knew Phidrik could hear his Song , but Ridimon ventured no explanation , and Phidrik asked for none . It was sacred Kido tradition that a Guildsman would never ask of what he learned - nor tell of it . Now Phidrik was singing bawdy tunes of Farassi pirate women as he manned the helm of the airboat , and Ridimon wondered how a backwater Kido native in absolute time knew songs from a thousand years past and a hundred systems away . Phidrik claimed that interpretation of molecular sound waves distracted the human mind from the Song of Kido . Ridimon found that the random-chatter static fed through the translator implant in his ear seemed more effective . Phidrik also offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippery and tougher for the Song to grasp . Ridimon declined . Phidrik himself was somehow immune to the Song . It did not sing to him , or if it did , he tuned it out . And that allowed him to hear the Song of others . While Phidrik was as human as Ridimon , at least within the genetic scope of recent OutRim breeding , he was probably descended from modified Calamit stock . So perhaps he had an edited cerebral chemistry , or an adaptive aural processing mutation in his derivative Kido lineage . Or perhaps , as Phidrik claimed , immunity from the Song was just willpower , whiskey , and the favor of the swamp spirits . That night , on the fifth day out from Qidrit , Ridimon heard a cry from the swamps - a single , lonely wail of despair . It rose from the darkness below the Canopy and clamped an icy hand over Ridimon 's heart . He knew he had heard that cry before , a cry full of pain , the same cry that had sent him fleeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear anything at all , but Ridimon could tell Phidrik was lying . Then Phidrik casually suggested that there were often TransCom gas miners from Qidrit in the swamps , and sometimes they got lost . " We should go down and help them , " Ridimon said . " You want to join them in their agony , yes ? " Phidrik asked . " No help for them if they 're lost in the swamps . " Ridimon pretended to accept that , and returned to the neural processor to monitor the sensors . But he was not satisfied , especially because there was no trace of any cry or wail in any molecular sound frequency , and the only electromagnetic signature was the infrared passage of a swarm of bog flies moving to the east . And yet , even in the belly of the airboat , Ridimon could still hear the cry . At first he tried to deny it , to ignore it , but his heart pounded , his hands trembled , and his determination wavered . It was his curse . Brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same tubes , dripping pumps . They wait until the next mission , the next hull full of moaning corpses . Then fire , roaring wind and melting metal . Screams of the living turn to screams of the dead . The men with the questions floating by , hanging in blood , worried faces now bloated . Brother , sister , friends in shared misery drifting in vacuum , crying and-yes , regretting . Escape , rescue , flight . Ridimon awoke again aboard the airboat , just before dawn . Phidrik sat at the helm , humming an Imperium marching tune , and from below , in the swamps , rose the wail and moan of what Ridimon knew without a doubt was a dead soul . He buried his face in his hands . His life until then had been an escape from the dead . It took every bit of courage he had not to run away again . Back in Qidrit , Phidrik had seemed to be a typical absolute local , reserved and steeped in the dignified Kido tradition - a Guildsman to whom kigrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a kigrin was a sacred ritual shared only cautiously with relative spacers from off-world . Now he slouched at the helm of the airboat , charting their progress on the spectrum-grids as he knocked back Orestie rum and spun tall tales of Quitsitt warlords . He asked about the worlds Ridimon had visited , the Imperium protectorates , trans-Gate merchant fortunes , power lost , power found , alcohol consumed . His mind seemed to wander in random directions while searching for conversation ; sometimes it was itchy and edgy , sometimes longing and lonely . Ridimon did n't care to answer , for even without translator lag conversation was a lost art to him . Phidrik answered his own questions anyway , telling Ridimon that Imperium citizens were vindictive , and trans-Gate fortunes were best built from specialty art and artifacts that were unaffected by hyper-c time divergence . Power these days was lost in politics , or religion ; but power was found in hyper-c infrastructure . And , of course , there was nothing sweeter in the universe than a pint of Orestie rum . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiff . As Ridimon spotted a thrashing in the leaves of a kidaah tree Phidrik jammed the throttle forward , and the chase was on . Ridimon crouched for protection under the front windshield , nearly falling out when Phidrik jerked the skiff around a breather bog and did a full-throttle back-cross into the kigrin 's path . Ridimon caught a brief glimpse of flat , dead eyes and needle-like talons as the kigrin 's serpentine body snapped around itself to change direction . Somehow it slithered through the air almost faster than the eye could see . Phidrik cursed as he fired a charge from the mesh harpoon . The net missed and Phidrik accelerated the skiff forward again . Leaves and vines and branches slashed by them as they wove in and around the trees . When they topped a dense phistni ridge , a wail suddenly streaked by the skiff , and another , and another , and then Ridimon thought it was n't branches slashing at him , but rather invisible arms and hands , all cold and dead , all reaching and groping for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dull roar . Jump . Lack of life is lack of death . Contraband cargo and droning photomic drives , crank the combine valves , mind the meters , dance the blend to the detonation line , deny the boredom . Alone in the dark of the fusion deck , avoid the captain , avoid the jibes , avoid the humiliation , lump . A blue planet through a porthole , teeming in dead , another captain , another choice , another excuse . A timeless toll , a hollow soul , lump . The next day , after Ridimon had recovered again , Phidrik said , " We should go back , if you value your life . " The neural processor steered the airboat while Phidrik swung in a hammock up at the prow , nursing his bottle . Though he was afraid of the answer , Ridimon asked why . " Because you 're a coward , yes . " When Ridimon showed no emotional response Phidrik scowled and added , " Because I 've been listening to your Song for the past five days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , a battle that showed you how different you are . Cursed to hear the dead . I tell you that 's dangerous , because where you want to go , in the swamps , the dead swarm like bog flies . " Ridimon 's heart pounded . And still , still .... Reckless . Ridimon said , " I hear cries , in my mind . The cries of dead souls . " " I know . " " From where ? Qidrit ? " " From Qidrit , from every other mining town on the planet . The Song that draws living things into the swamps , it 's just a byproduct , a faint echo of a larger Song that attracts all things dead and gone . " " Why ? What is this Song , what creates it ? " Phidrik shrugged , the same shrug the other locals had given Ridimon when he first arrived on the planet . Ridimon could n't decide if Phidrik truly did n't know or was merely unwilling to tell . Phidrik took a long drink and looked sadly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or as if it held the cure Ridimon sought . He asked , " How does an Imperium human like you hear the dead ? A natural thing , is it ? A gift of birth , yes ? " Ridimon prepared to lie , but instead he said , " It was the end of the Third Imperium , when the war turned and the Neroxan separatists invaded the OutRim . The Emperor sold prisoners to the Defense Ministry 's gen lab . A lot of us were direct Terran stock , with a clean genetic code . " Phidrik whistled through his teeth . " Not many of you left . " Ridimon continued , " The gen lab was desperate enough to experiment with neuromatic engineering . Psionic amplification . Esper gates . Or magic . Hocus-pocus , whatever the hell it was . They wanted to send us into wrecked ships after battle , to find dead Neroxan officers , pry information from their souls - plans , strategy , tactics . " Phidrik said , " Strategy means nothing to a dead man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ridimon 's voice weakened . " The tides turned , the Neroxans attacked . Few of us escaped . " After a long pause Phidrik said , " Death scares you , yes ? " " Death scares everyone . " " Maybe . But most people only think about it in passing . Only when it plucks an acquaintance , a friend , a lover . " " Yeah , well , I live it every day . The dead are all around , the dead from ten thousand years of human existence - and ten thousand millennia of non-human existence . " " Ever talk to them ? " " I try not to . " Phidrik hissed . " So just ignore them . " " I ca n't . L ... " Ridimon hesitated , then said , " I 've never met a dead soul that was n't full of ... regret . " Phidrik laughed , as if mocking Ridimon . " So you 've spent the last thousand absolute years hiding in space , running from time as a shipman aboard spec-jaunting merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While you spend a relative month ramping up the fusion drives to hit a Gate at the Rifkin threshold , the rest of the universe spends fifty years getting old - that much closer to death . Plus , not so many dead people in empty space , yes ? " Ridimon said , " Yeah , well , I woke up one day and I was tired of running . " It was a turning point , the kind that comes once a lifetime , if that - sudden , random , and completely contrary to everything that had gone before . Phidrik laughed again , a superior laugh . " That 's crap , Ridimon , and you know why ? Because photomics sends a ship through a Gate at speeds up to the Rifkin threshold , but to go hyper-c the body 's got ta be dead . Skelli technology tricks photomics into thinking the human bodies are dead - it hides their souls , then it pushes them through the Gates along with the rest of the ship . But the Skelli are all gone , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race before it ever realized the Skelli created the Gates . Not that the Skelli did n't deserve it , they were a callous lot anyway , nasty , eating passengers and selling ships to Farassi pirates for salvage . " " Shut up about the hyper-c Gates ! " Ridimon 's patience was nearly gone . " I ramped up to my last Gate before you were even bom in this time frame . " " You think so , yes ? " Phidrik laughed again and said , " One day the hyper-c Gate will send the ship but it wo n't send your soul . You know hyper-c technology is in decay , the Gates arc crumbling , no one understands how to save them . It 's only a matter of time before interstellar travel diminishes . First system nets , then local pockets , then nothing . Soon , soon , especially in relative time , you wo n't be able to outrun death . " Despite the arrogance in Phidrik there was a touch of sincerity as well . Ridimon said , " Maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Phidrik seemed to weigh options and eventually said , " I do n't know how to cure you , but the kigrin of Kido probably do , if you are shrewd enough to trick the information out of them . I do not think you 're that shrewd , my friend . But I will hunt you a kigrin so you can find out . " Phidrik extended the airfoils , eased the throttle forward , and the airboat accelerated out across the Canopy toward the east . As the muggy air of Kido rushed past , Phidrik took another swig from his bottle and said , " It 's a cruel paradox , yes ? In seeking the secrets of death , you risk the dying before the knowing . " THE NEXT MORNING Phidrik and Ridimon dropped through the Canopy in the skiff . They took the flex nets , several mesh harpoons , one deck-mounted pulse rifle , and a processor remote . After nearly an hour on the faint trail Phidrik came to an empty root cavern in a kidaah tree . He found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture between his fingers . " Ten-span , female , eaten mostly phistrii leaves recently . She 's an ornery old hag . And a damn hypocrite because she 'd never admit it . I 'll teach her , yes . " Kigrin , Phidrik explained as he picked up the trail again , were lazy creatures at bean . They could be sly , and cunning , but mostly their intelligence was spent in finding the pungent sweetness of soft mud , or the tickle of beetles across a relaxed wing . Time was meaningless to them , and linear thought was equally pointless . The Song pulled at the kigrin , but it showed them only what they already knew they were : creatures of the moment , content with mist and water and mud . They wanted no more than that , and so the Song could not conquer them . Another hour passed as Phidrik and Ridimon skimmed mist-covered pools of water that snaked their way in and around kidaah trees . Leathery bats flapped away from the drone of the skiff 's drive as it threaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead sometimes floated in from the distance , always at the edge of Ridimon 's senses . Behind them the Song of Kido slowly built itself louder than the buzz of his translator , then suddenly Jump . The frigate plows empty space and loneliness ; the only trust is trust in physics , dilantium hulls , oxygen recyclers . The only faith is the promise of the hypez-c Gates , alien technology , atoms and neurons and souls recorabined the way they began . Relative space , relative time , relative faith . The frigate orbits a planet , another chance , another choice . Absolute world , absolute faith . But no absolute for a relative man . Jump again . Phidrik grabbed Ridimon 's shoulder , and the buzzing stopped . They were in a copse where the kidaah trees were dense and strong fen-moss sprang up from spongy ground . Phidrik dangled a charm on a string in front of Ridimon and told him to put it around his neck . The charm was a small tooth with the figure of a kigrin etched into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phidrik said , protection against both the swamp and the Song . Phidrik did a little chant , and Ridimon wondered if he was trying not to crack a smile . " Know this , Ridimon , " Phidrik said when he was done and the smile was gone . " As long as the Song is sour , you can resist it . When the tune becomes sweet , when it becomes what you want , that is when it has you , and you will never escape it . " Ridimon hesitated , but when he put the charm around his neck the Song faded and calmness came over him . The occasional cry of the dead seemed much more distant and less threatening . For the first time since dropping planetside he took a deep breath without feeling suffocated . Phidrik began to string a flex net between two kidaah trees . After watching him work for five days Ridimon thought he had figured out the man 's secret : to be a true kigrin hunter , to be immune to the Song , Phidrik must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was at peace with that knowledge . Much like a kigrin , perhaps . The fact that Phidrik was an impulsive drunk to the core only made Ridimon bitter . Ridimon helped Phidrik string several more flex nets not far from the first . In the dim , mist-filled air the translucent nets were nearly invisible . Phidrik then scouted back west in the skiff until he found a swarm of bog flies . He circled the skiff around the swarm and said , " This one should work nicely . " From the middle of the swarm rose a faint moan that convulsed into a cry of pain , then subsided into a whimper . Ridimon slowly realized the bog flies were swarming around a human soul . Maybe the very soul he had heard wailing the night before . " Many things feed off the dead , " Phidrik stated , anticipating Ridimon 's question . " Even the bog flies of Kido . " Ridimon felt cold despite the mugginess of the swamps . Phidrik handed the skiff controls to Ridimon , telling him to circle tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke to the soul in words Ridimon did not quite understand . Phidrik 's voice echoed above the buzz of the flies , as if it were truly louder and held more meaning in some other dimension . The soul responded , but not in any molecular sound wave that Ridimon 's translator could pick up . To Ridimon it sounded like begging and pleading , and Phidrik answered in more echoing whispers . Slowly the soul followed Phidrik 's voice , and Phidrik lured it farther east , not far from the flex nets . When he stopped speaking the soul cried out in despair and seemed to lose momentum - or perhaps desire . Phidrik took back the controls and hid the skiff behind phistrii growth a good hundred paces off . Phidrik fired up the neural processor remote and monitored the spectrum reports relayed from the sensors to the airboat and back down to the skiff . " Human souls , " he said , " only hear what they want to hear . You must listen to what they 're saying , find what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or revenge . This one merely wanted to say good-bye to its wife . I told it she was over here . " Ridimon felt sorry for the soul , and for all the souls he had encountered over a thousand years . And of this one , who had such a wife to yearn for , he also felt jealous . Phidrik read the processor remote and said , " Wo n't be long now . " Ridimon 's recklessness seemed to have deserted him , replaced by a heavy feeling of dread . He and Phidrik waited patiently until Phidrik suddenly pointed . Ridimon saw a swell in the water under the bog flies as translucent , vein-laced wings and a serpentine body emerged from beneath the surface . The flies scattered in an angry buzz , and the soul let out a shriek of terror . Then the shriek was muffled as the wings folded around the space containing the soul , and the body splashed back into the water , head first . For a moment the kigrin twisted and writhed around , its tail flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidaah trees . Ridimon realized in honor that the soul was bait , and the kigrin was somehow eating the soul . And then his heart sank further : the kigrin of Kido themselves were n't attracted to the Song , they were attracted to the souls that were attracted to the Song , and they fed off of those souls . Ridimon felt sick and could barely hang on when Phidrik shot the skiff through the air , hissing while firing the pulse rifle in a rapid staccato . The kigrin rose out of the water when it realized it was not alone . Phidrik continued firing , not at it , but around it . Swamp water boiled , phistrii leaves sizzled , and the kigrin let out a scream that shook the trees . Then the kigrin fled , half running , half flying in the direction forced by Phidrik , right through the kidaah trees and into the flex nets . The kigrin 's neck snapped to the side first , then the rest of the body slammed into the nets . Phidrik abandoned the pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mesh strands wrapped around the kigrin 's legs and wings and constricted with an audible hiss . The kigrin let out another scream , thrashed around , and then realized it was caught . Phidrik brought the skiff to a hover about thirty paces out . He took tension and stress readings from the transmitters on the nets , and remotely adjusted the pressure distribution . The kigrin remained still , staring at the two of them . Phidrik motioned at Ridimon as if shooing him away . Ridimon hopped down from the skiff onto semi-solid ground . His recklessness was gone , and now he was only helpless . A thousand years of struggle had come to a single point in time over which he had little real control . Ridimon put one foot in front of the other , slowly , until he stood ten paces from the kigrin . He said , " How can my curse be cured ? " The kigrin 's dead , black eyes blinked once . Its head swiveled as if glancing at Phidrik back on the skiff , then swiveled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the kigrin 's mouth remained still . The voice was Imperium Standard and feminine , but with sibilance much like Phidrik 's . For such information there is a price . " What is that price ? " You must let me loose . " How do I know you wo n't kill me if I let you go ? " You do n't , and that is the crux of your problem , yes ? Death . Are you willing to gamble your life to cure your affliction ? Ridimon looked back at Phidrik for help , but the Kido native merely sat motionless on the prow of the skiff , watching and waiting . Ridimon turned back to the kigrin and asked , " What good will a cure be to me if I am dead ? " Perhaps a great deal of good , human . Are you here in front of me now because you are afraid of living among the dead , or because you are afraid of dying among the dead ? Dying the way they have - with regret ? There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting latent , but with unimaginable potential . Suddenly Ridimon was afraid not only of dying , but of the horrible truths this kigrin might reveal . What if you are cured so that you never again hear the dead screaming in agony ? Are you not still destined to join them ? You have outrun death for a thousand years , but you can not run forever . Ridimon dropped to his knees , and fear became panic . A millennium of running had been pointless , and a cure to his curse might be only an artificial reprieve from the inevitable . All the dead souls you have encountered have been miserable and bitter , and sooner or later , human , you will join them . But I will tell you this-you are a fool if you think that all souls exist in pain . No creature is predestined for such a fate . I know what you need to do , human , to avoid it . This secret and more I offer you - if only you will set me free . A small bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his curse suddenly seemed of secondary importance to the greater secrets of death . But he said , " I saw you before , I saw what your kind do . If I free you then you 'll kill me and eat my soul . " If I snow you what you seek , human , you may beg me to eat your soul . The kigrin would not elaborate , and so Ridimon was left to choose - live on in ignorance , still cursed , still doomed . But live .... Or finally grasp the cure he had sought his entire life , and maybe die today in the maw of the kigrin , with no chance to use the knowledge . Ridimon knelt in the muck of the swamps of Kido . He should not be afraid to die , he had been ready to face this moment from the instant he had decided to stop running . The Gates were dying , and from the sprawling Imperium protectorates to the farthest OutRim seeding colonies he had never found a world to call his own . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , only death on the razor teeth of a kigrin . Ridimon opened his mouth to accept the bargain , but nothing came out . He strained to speak but his body did not comply . An eternity passed ; he stood there , frozen , and only in his mind did he eventually hear himself utter , from some place far away , " No , no , no ... please .... " But he could not do it . He barely felt anything when Phidrik pulled him from the muck into the safety of the skiff . From that same faroff place he heard the kigrin roar , but then a second roar overpowered the first , and turned into a snarl , then finally a low hiss . As the skiff broke through the top of the Canopy , Ridimon lay in a daze of confusion and anger and cowardice . That is what he was - a coward - unable to carry through with what he had to do , the very reckless thing that had driven him for all this time . He had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . Phidrik docked the skiff with the airboat and prodded Ridimon to get up . Ridimon groaned and turned away . Phidrik said , " What , ca n't live with yourself now ? Might as well throw yourself overboard and snap your neck . Except that 's exactly what you do n't have the guts to do . " Ridimon raised his head , slowly , and saw Phidrik kneeling over the prow of the airboat , offering a hand to help him up the ladder from the skiff . Behind Phidrik , in that vast , empty sky , shone the Kido system sun , silhouetting the Kido native . And surrounding him , hovering around him , was the ghostly image of a kigrin , nearly transparent yet unquestionably massive . Ridimon cried out in confusion and scrambled to the back of the skiff . Phidrik slowly stepped back onto the airboat , and as the sun 's positioning behind him changed the ghost image disappeared . " What the hell was that ? " Ridimon shouted . Phidrik lowered his hand and asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Phidrik sighed and after a long moment of thought he said , " That , Ridimon , was my true form . " " What are you talking about ? " Ridimon jumped behind the pulse rifle on the skiff and aimed it at Phidrik 's chest . Phidrik shook his head . " You can not kill me , Ridimon . I am already dead . " Ridimon sat behind the rifle , stunned . Phidrik 's form slowly began to melt , then expand . Slick , tattooed skin turned gray and wet , wings sprouted with translucent veins , the neck lengthened , extra arms grew out of the torso and the head became diamond . With the increased weight the front of the airboat sank , and the neural processor strained to maintain level . Ridimon heard in his mind : Myself and my kind have been dead foi eons . Our physical bodies were as you see now , but before we died we learned the secrets of disguise , illusion that tricked not just the sentient mind , but matter-atoms , quarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with matter in a way that it didn " t know we were only spiritual remnants of animate beings . What pbotomics does n't know wo n't hurt it , yes ? Ridimon was speechless . The illusion became permanent . We could take any appearance we desired , but in doing so we could never return to our true form , not even to finally accept the death we had cheated . We 're not made of matter , we 're no longer of spirit . We 're what exists in the emptiness between the two . Ridimon fingered the trigger on the pulse rifle . He said with disgust , " You eat human souls . " Without souk we grow dormant . We need the essence of a soul 's photomic pattern to help us maintain cohesion , and with those patterns we retain those souls " memories and knowledge and emotions . We 've " survived on many types of souls over the past millennia - the hyanin , Quitsit , Skelli , the gh " halanidians . You humans are merely the latest in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Why are you telling me this ? What have you been doing leading me around for the past five days , pretending to be some human ? " I protect the other kigrin . The humans that consider themselves natives of Kido worship us , and we provide occasional theatrics for them - a successful hunt here and there . But TransCom is a new player in the Kido system . The Impenum " s industrial mandate is pressing TransCom to expand its gas mining deeper into the swamps . So I take human form and keep watch . If a human represents a danger to our safety , I do what is necessary to eliminate him . Ridimon remembered the innocent tip from the bartender in the tavern at Qidrit - try Phidrik , he 's local , he speaks the Song , he 's got kigrin blood in his veins . And all along Ridimon had thought it was Orestie rum . Ridimon said , " Yeah , well , you going to eat me now , too ? " The form of the kigrin shimmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all retracted and melted back into the slick , hairless humanoid with the black eyes . He spoke again , this time with a real voice , " I should have killed you the first day out , Ridimon . I knew you were different . But you know why I did n't ? " He spread his hands out and frowned . " Pettiness , I suppose . I enjoyed toying with you , I enjoyed the power I had over you , squeezing you for fear . It was a game where only I knew the rules . You see , the human souls in me dominate the others , they try to dominate each other , and I ca n't always control them . They 've tainted me , made me so damn petty . Not to mention selfish . " Ridimon heard the hatred in the voice , even if it almost seemed to be self-hatred . But Ridimon was n't in any mood for sympathy . He kept the rifle trained on Phidrik and said , " Welcome to humanity . " " You would 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would 've let you , I thought that was what you wanted . But maybe you are n't ready to die just yet . " " Damn straight . " Not without knowing what the kigrin meant about the fate of souls . Ridimon 's cowardice suddenly seemed excusable ; he did n't have all the facts , and these creatures did n't play fair , so their game was forfeit . Phidrik said , " She spoke the truth . You must think more like the absolute man to see it . That means having faith . At least in yourself . " Through a thousand systems Ridimon had passed over a hundred thousand faiths , religious and otherwise , and not one had ever offered him the peace he sought . He did n't have enough faith in faith . " If you do n't make a choice , Ridimon , the Gates will make it for you . " Ridimon wondered if it was already too late , and even if it was not , he doubted he could ever do what Phidrik suggested . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating . He tried not to despair . " Do n't you understand that I 'm trying to help you ? " Phidrik stepped to the edge of the airboat , giving Ridimon an easy shot at him , but his voice was now angry and impatient . " Yeah , I understand , " Ridimon said . That I 'm lucky to be alive and you are bound to kill me . " The flex nets made no difference , Ridimon . The kigrin down there could have killed you at any time . She wanted to . But she did n't because I told her not to . You see , the other kigrin obey my commands . The human souls I 've eaten make me more aggressive , faster , smarter . The other kigrin are afraid of me , of my humanness . Hell , they were always afraid of me , even before you humans came along . That 's why they chose me to mingle with your kind . So you could be dead twenty different ways by now . But you 're not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , untethered the mooring lines and pushed the small craft away from the airboat . Phidrik let him . Ridimon climbed back behind the pulse rifle and aimed it at Phidrik 's chest . " You looking for a medal , then ? " " Fool , " Phidrik said , and he took the flask of Orestie rum from his belt . He drained half of it in one long gulp . Streams of the alcohol ran down his chin . He held up the flask and said bitterly , " Illusion . I ca n't touch matter . You know what it 's like to be an alcoholic who ca n't ever again taste a drop of Orestie rum ? A father with no children ? A painter with no canvas ? A dreamer with no dreams ? " Phidrik took another gulp from the flask and wiped his face with his sleeve . He hurled the flask toward the skiff and Ridimon heard in his mind : You will , Ridimon . You will . Phidrik smiled his leering smile , and Ridimon let loose with the pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phidrik 's body as if it was n't there . The bolts hit the cabin of the airboat behind him , setting off a string of explosions . Bits of metal flew , and a concussion of hot air rocked back over Ridimon . Phidrik 's form shifted , expanding and melting into the wings and neck and tail of the kigrin . The wings flapped and the kigrin took flight , sending the airboat spinning in the opposite direction . Ridimon streaked away in the skiff , yet he still heard Phidrik in his mind : I 'd die to travel the stars and live a human life , but I ca n't , I 'm already dead and bound to protect a planet full of lazy , slothful creatures . I 've got only stolen memories , and you , you bastard , you can truly live , and you choose not to . Ridimon dove right through the Canopy , not waiting to find an opening . Branches snapped off the pulse rifle from its turret , smashed the windshield , and nearly ripped Ridimon out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the swamps underneath . He flew at full speed , not caring about direction . Phidrik 's voice followed in Ridimon 's mind , fleeting and still bitter : Beware the Song , Ridimon . Kigrin are older than humans , but the Song is far older than kigrin . If you run I ca n't protect you . RIDIMON WANDERED , searching for the right path back to Qidrit . He was a lonely , artificial intruder gliding not through a forest of kidaah trees , but through a forest of souls . The dead around him wailed and moaned , their collective cries telling him he was doomed . All he had to do was stop and they would drag his soul down into the muck of the swamps where the souls of cowards truly belonged . He thought Qidrit should be due west . He sometimes risked a moment above the Canopy to take crude altitude readings of the Kido sun , trying to plot a hopeless path . Once he dared to turn on the processor remote to try and locate Phidrik , but when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens of a vid sensor he hurled the remote into the swamp . When Ridimon 's thirst became unbearable he drained a small stream of the pure water from the skiff 's ion tank . When the tank ran dry he added swamp water , and when the propulsion nozzles clogged with swamp muck he spent precious time trying to clean and flush the system . The ion levels in the tank slowly fell , and with them , Ridimon 's hopes . At night he anchored the skiff just under the top of the Canopy and tied himself to the broken turret so he would not climb out under the control of the Song . The charm no longer seemed to protect him , and the Song returned , louder now , beating on him from all sides . A broken spiderweb in the top of the Canopy , glistening in the starlight . The spider on a single strand , hangingin the breeze , waiting . An old man uses clawed hands to tie strands , talons clack together , faint , meticulous work . The web grows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole runs a river of rum . The old man steps through the center , a small kigrin emerges on the other side , it flaps away , the spider tries to follow ; strand to strand , the center always moves , it ca n't be reached . The rum spills through and turns to blood . Ridimon fretted in delirium between bouts of the Song . He was running again because he had failed to cure his curse , or to find the secrets of death . Now evil things lurked in the swamps with him , and he constantly ducked in fear of the flap of wings and the snap of jaws . He thought of Phidrik and the hunger in those dead eyes when Phidrik had talked of human souls . And Ridimon knew that Phidrik had developed a taste for them - a human taste . Hyper-c ships in orbit like bog-flies , shuttles to the surface like metallic rain . Red uniforms , Imperium troops dripping off surface transports , collecting , rivulets of soul flowing into the swamps . Kigrin engorged , devouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamps , Kido , the Gate . Through the Gate , pouring , more souls . Watching , a face buried in hands , the hands are claws . Ridimon let the skiff float back up through the Canopy . He lay on the floor and did not care anymore about hiding from Phidrik . All he could see was the vast , open sky ; he tried to let his soul float up into it and disperse . He did not notice when the skiff drifted between the massive support struts that raised the mining town of Qidrit above the Canopy . Nor did he care when a TransCom airboat wove its way between the struts to retrieve him from death . Ridimon awoke in a bed in a small , dark room . Several drip lines ran from an ancient utility-med into his right arm , and for a moment he was back in the war , being prepped for the next wreckage sweep . But the room was lined in Kido wood paneling and primitive Kido lamps and chairs - it was not a scientific laboratory . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Time passed , and Ridimon did not worry where he was . He only cared that he was no longer in the swamps , at the mercy of the Song , or in the shadow of Phidhk 's wings . After a while the door opened and a man came in . He introduced himself as the Director of Operations for TransCom mining and explained that Ridimon had been in Qidrit for four days , recovering from fever and delirium brought on by " swamp sickness . " The Director asked where he was from , what he was doing on Kido , and what had happened on the hunt . Ridimon decided not to say anything but found himself a shade of the truth . A surge of panic spread through him . The Director was a human of indeterminate stock , though definitely not a native of Kido . His questions were concise and his tone was uncompromising . There was an arrogance in his demeanor , the same arrogance Ridimon had found in the gen-lab technicians and the Gatehopping frigate captains and even in the alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcend genetics and span a galaxy . The Director probed details about Phidrik , asking what the guide had said over the course of the hunt and exactly how he had said it . The questions went on for almost an hour , then the Director abruptly left . Later a Kido med-tech came in , but he said nothing as he hooked Ridimon to a download port on the utility-med 's console . Ridimon tried to pull away but the restraints would n't let him , and in an instant he knew all of his neural translator records had been transcoded into the local frame . Some time later the Director returned , and this time the questions were more hypothetical : " Do you believe this Phidrik really eats souls ? " Yes . I saw it happen . " Do you think he has eaten Skelli souls in the past ? " Yes . " And so he retains the knowledge of the Skelli ? " The knowledge of those Skelli souls he ate . Yes . " Knowledge of how the hyper-c Gates operate ? " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired ? " Possibly . The Director left but the implications of his questions lingered behind Ridimon 's mental fog : the possible key to the restoration of galactic hyper-c travel lay in the dead soul of an alien deep in the swamps of Kido . And yet , as monumental as that idea was , Ridimon did n't really care . Hyper-c was precious little good to someone who could n't even sit up . After concocting a thousand impossible methods of escape , Ridimon wondered what he would do with freedom anyway . The kigrin had said not all souls were doomed to misery , yet why had he never found such a soul ? Where were they ? Phidrik had talked of faith , and faith was a thing foreign to Ridimon , who lived by the metal hull of a frigate and the predictability of death . But if there was ever a time when Ridimon felt a little bit closer to having a faith , in a god , in himself , or anything else , it was then . Perhaps there was hope yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning the door opened . Two men in TransCom uniforms came through , untied him , and carried him out . He tried to struggle but did not have the strength . The two men hauled him a long distance and eventually bent him face-first over the railing at the very edge of the Qidrit mining platform . A hundred feet below him the support struts of the city disappeared into the Canopy , and a thousand feet below that they met the surface of the swamps . Ridimon felt cold metal pressed to the base of his skull and he knew it was the barrel of a pistol . Suddenly saliva welled in his mouth , and bile rose his gorge . He tried to cry out , " No , wait , please , please - " A searing pain flashed through his head , but only for an instant , then a cascade of light filled his mind . Somehow he could still feel tenor as hands lifted him up over the railing and threw him out into the open air beyond . As he fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ridimon awoke , groggy , floating . He wondered how he had survived the fall and the pistol . Trying to look around , Ridimon had trouble focusing : he was aware of kidaah trees looming over him and shafts of sunlight piercing his body , and there was a distant buzzing in his ears that would n't go away . Behind the buzzing was a pull , whispering to him , compelling him . He was drifting toward it . Then he was aware of another presence , a kigrin circling him , wading through the murky water . The kigria said , Is it what you expected ? Bog flies buzzed around Ridimon , biting at him , swarming , he tried to swat at the noise but he could n't , his arms did not respond . Then Ridimon realized that he could n't see his body , he did n't have a body , all that he was consisted solely of impression , a feel for what was around him , and behind it all , constantly pulling , the uncounted memories and potential futures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am dead . " And then , " It was n't supposed to be like this . " Ridimon also found that the dead could still feel anger . A rage welled up inside him , and he wanted to scream in frustration - or bitterness . Was n't a human who could hear the dead worth keeping alive ? Even as a tool or a pawn ? The circling kigrin was Phidrik , as somehow Ridimon knew it would be . Phidrik said , Your knowledge was too dangerous , Ridimon . With your ability you might have been useful to TransCom . But there are lmpeiium agents in TransCom , and they leave nothing to chance . Not with so much at stake . " How do you know that ? " I 've eaten TransCom souls . Ridimon 's anger simmered , though for how long he could n't tell . Time had become meaningless . But eventually the anger detached itself and left him numb . He tried not to think of what he had left behind : all his ambitions , all that he had meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment . And he tried not to think of the horrors in the Song , the many paths to misery . He pictured instead the kigrin in the swamps with him , things immediate , the past irrelevant , the future unimportant . He wondered if Phidrik was going to eat him , and though he had no vocal cords to make sound , Phidrik understood . The kigrin said to him , If I consume your soul you 'll become part of me , I 'll become part of you . Ridimon struggled to concentrate , to keep his thoughts from floating away . He thought , " What choice do I have ? " Only the Song of Kido . There 's no escaping it unless I take your soul myself . After a moment , or an eternity , Ridimon asked one final time , " What is the Song ? " Perhaps death had earned him the truth . The kigrin shrugged , at least that was the impression Ridimon received , and somehow Ridimon thought he should be irritated by that , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , When Hived , Ifeaied the Song . I resisted , we all did , and paid the price . But I 've been watching souls pass through these swamps all the millennia since , and you know what I thinki I think the Song is a door - an ultimate , eternal Gate . I think that this life is a gestation for the next , we 're as ignorant about that new world as a baby in the womb . It takes birth through that door to experience the world beyond . Destiny , fate , inevitable ? Ridimon asked , " My soul , it is meant to get pulled ... through this Gate ? " It 's not a pull , Ridimon . It 's a push . And Ridimon knew Phidrik was right . The Song was not pulling him in , the world was pushing him out : the water , the drops in the water , the atoms in the drops . Trees were bending to push him , sunlight was pushing him , the bugs were swarming and collectively pushing him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of telling you to move on . " All those souls you have eaten , then - all detoured and ambushed . All denied their fate . " The door and Song , they 're one end to a soul 's journey . Union with a kigrin is another . Who 's to say one is better than the other , or that there 's only one proper path for a soul after death1 . A line of kigrin formed along each side of Ridimon 's drifting path . They rose on their hind legs , flapped their wings , and roared in unison , but they let him pass . Phidrik was with him , protecting him . The kigrin were angry with Phidrik , defiant . I 'm offering you eternity in this world , Ridimon , if you join me . Guaranteed existence as part of a larger whole . Or , you can follow the Song . The choice is yours . It 's a choice few ever receive . Ridimon had trouble focusing , everything swirled around him . Or was he swirling around everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to make it , he had never been able to make choices . He said instead , " I think TransCom knows about you , about kigrin . I think the Imperium knows you are the key to hyper-c travel . I think they will come . Waves and waves . I think I told them . " It does n't matter . " The death of hyper-c would be the end . Of humans . Of souls . Of you . " Maybe . " You want them to come . " Yes . For our own survival . And more . Thanks to your species I have created life and destroyed worlds , trusted and betrayed and been betrayed . I 've sacrificed my life for my own brother , sacrificed my life to save my brother 's murderer . I 've murdered my brother . I 've murdered myself .... Such twisted passions , so endless , so enthralling , especially to kigrin - we 've been cold at heart for so long . Now I think some of us are more human than kigrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a human . " Yes . What humans do n't have , they want , and what humans do have , they want more of . But here 's another human weakness for you : duty . Ridimon 's impression of the swamps changed , green became red , water blood , kignn rose , bloated on a river of souls . He closed his mind , somehow , and when he reached out again the swamp was green and murky and sleeping . The kigrin still lined his path , hissing , they were thin , they wanted to eat him , but Phidrik was near . " The other souls to come . No choice for them ? " No . " Why give it , then , to me ? " Maybe ... maybe friendship is another human trait I 'm struggling to figure out . Or , if not friendship , then at least compassion . Or simple whim . Ridimon felt that he would smile if he had a mouth , and a body . The idea was almost comforting for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the other souls I met . All wandering . Resisting the push . Fighting . " Souls at peace with themselves go the way of the Song , and that is why you could not find them in your travels . The souls that are left resist the Song , or are too far away from it . Though there are many other doors , many other Songs , many souls look in the wrong direction , they wo n't let go . And so they 're doomed to wander . A whole galaxy full of them . " If only - " There 's nothing you can do for them now . Your future lies here . " Death is ... not what I expected . " And then Ridimon was done deciding , he let the leaves and the mists and the bog flies push him forward , to the Song , to his future . He did not look back , not even at Phidrik , he had nothing to look back to . He was curious , and afraid . And for once in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
