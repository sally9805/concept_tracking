Normally , I avoid domestic disputes , but this girl is standing in the middle of my hallway , and she 's hitting herself in the head . With her own shoes . I could turn around , take the elevator back down to the lobby , and notify the doorman . But Omar knows I 'm a cop . He 'd send me right back up here . She 's my next-door neighbor , unit 1612 . Her name is Katie or Kathy or something cute that does n't quite fit , especially now . She 's a small girl with a lot of blond hair and a mouth even worse than mine . She lived here by herself when I moved in two years ago . The first time her late-night partying kept me up , I tried to be reasonable : I slipped a friendly note under her door . The next few times , I made official complaints to the Association . The last time , about a year ago , I invited my co-workers over . They busted her snorting coke with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she never says hello . " You 'll be fucking sorry when I 'm fucking dead , you fucking asshole , " she yells , the profanities accentuated with a swift heel to her head . A forearm full of gold bracelets clinks , echoing her swing . I figure she 's high , but when she sees me she pauses , her arms midair , and her eyes are clear with conviction . I try to think of something to say . " Excuse me " does n't seem appropriate . I feel like I 'm in her way . She takes a step back , politely allowing me to pass , like this is an everyday thing . I stand there like an idiot . How can she be so serious when she looks so ridiculous ? When I do n't take the opportunity to make a break for my place , she turns her attention , her yelling , and her shoes to the door . " Did you hear what I said , you son of a bitch ? Do you even care if I die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard her arguing with this guy through my adjoining living room wall for a few weeks now . Senseless , hurtful arguing . Arguing about arguing . One night after a double shift I thought I could sleep for a week and I did n't sleep at all because I could hear them . What did you just say ? Say it again . I dare you . I felt like a kid back home with my parents in the next room . And just like when I was a kid , I tried not to listen . I closed my eyes and tried to think about other things . I told myself it was n't my problem to solve . Back then it became my problem . Now , it 's right in the middle of my hallway . " You think you can find someone better than me ? " the girl asks . " Besides your mother ? " Ouch . When the girl gets no response , she starts assaulting the door with her shoes . I 'm comforted it stands between them . I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 'm sure they 're all listening from inside their condos . Granted , that 's where most of them solve their own crises . By now , the humor of the scene is wearing thin , even when one of her French-manicured fingernails pops off . It just adds insult to insult . The girl keeps at it , and part of me wants to join her and yell at the guy too . I 'm sure he 's guilty of something . I work with men . My best friends are men . I know how they operate . The guys who play games can go play them at a bowling alley as far as I 'm concerned . On the other hand , this girl has n't exactly worn a halo since we 've been neighbors . It might not be my best move , but I decide to give this guy the benefit of the doubt . I get behind her and grab her arms to stop her from whacking me in the head . Surprisingly , she does n't resist me . Maybe she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and into mine . Maybe she 's tired . Maybe she 's ready to talk . Or maybe she wants me to hold her shoes so she can bang her head directly against the door . In her defense , I know sometimes there 's no reasoning with a woman in love . My dad ran around with every woman from here to Gary , Indiana , and my mom always accepted his lame excuses . No matter what he did , she 'd always take him back . I guess the good times must have been good enough for my mom . Of course I have n't discounted the possibility that she stayed with my dad just to make him miserable . I 'm the first to admit she might have been a little nuts . To her credit , though , I never saw her yell at a door . " You better let me in , Jerry , or I 'll do it ! " the girl in the hallway yells , and to this , she gets a response . The door opens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pills at her . He catches her off guard , and the bottle ricochets off her rib cage like a poorly lobbed whiffle ball . It does n't make a sound when it hits the carpet . " Do it , then , " he says . " You 're crazy . " Then he acknowledges me with a neighborly nod and closes the door as quietly as he opened it . The lock clicks . She looks over at me like she wants to confirm we just witnessed an atrocity , then snatches her shoes from my hands . I pick up the pills . They 're alprazolam , a generic anti-anxiety drug . When the girl resumes her raucous battle of footwear versus door , I think Jerry might be on to something . At this point I decide I 'm going to stick with my first instinct and find an acceptable way out . When we get a domestic violence call , the guys usually want me to deal with the woman , like we have some allegiance . It generally does n't work . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's about the last thing this girl needs . I know I should keep my mouth shut , go home , and get ready for my date . I do n't . " Maybe you should take a break . This whole hysterical thing is n't getting you anywhere . " I shake the bottle of pills like a maraca . She tucks the shoes under her arm and takes the bottle from me . " Asshole , " she mutters as she reads the label . " These wo n't kill me . " " He knows you 're not going to kill yourself , " I tell her . " You want him to respond to you ? You put those shoes on your feet and walk away . " " This is my place . If I kill myself , he 'll have to move out . " She 's clearly not listening , but at least she 's talking herself out of it . " He ca n't afford the rent . " She smacks the door a few more times before she runs out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have somewhere else you can go ? " I hope she says yes . " Why should I have to leave ? He 's the one who left the goddamned tickets in his pants pocket . He expects me to be psychic . I spend all day at the Laundromat while he 's God knows where , and when he comes back he acts like I deliberately ruined his big plans . . . " Wait a minute . " You 're threatening suicide over a load of laundry ? " Her answering glare is as close to a fuck you as you can get without saying it . I am really no good at this . If I ask about the tickets , I 'm acting like a cop . Actually if I ask her anything she 'll be defensive . What I really want to do is tell her to take one of those pills so I can get on my way . I can see my door from here , and I can hear my phone ringing . I 'll bet it 's Mason , wondering where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stand there and stare at the wall , waiting patiently for her to make the next move . I notice a subtle leafy pattern in the wallpaper . Did they remodel ? This is the longest I 've ever spent in this hallway . " Do you have a cigarette ? " the girl asks me , though she 's not really asking . She knows I smoke . She also knows I 'm a cop . And she thinks I owe her . I hand her my pack of Camels and a lighter . " I can go get Omar , " I offer . She hands me one of my smokes like she did n't hear me . Great . Two years of successfully avoiding each other , and now she wants to bond . " Have you ever been in love ? " she asks me as she reaches up to light my cigarette . I make the first drag of my smoke a long one . I 'm deciding if honesty will be helpful or the beginning of a conversation that 'll have me stuck here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sit down next to her . I knew I 'd feel guilty for busting her someday . If I can make sure she 's not going to off herself right here , though , I 'll be on my way after this cigarette with a clear conscience . She looks so vulnerable , sitting cross-legged in her pink socks . I wonder if they 're supposed to be that color . Maybe she screwed them up in the wash , too . " Are you in love now ? " she asks . " Yeah . " It feels good to admit it . " Does he lock you out of your own damn condo ? " " No . But I do n't do his laundry . " " Does he make you think you 're crazy ? Like everything 's your fault ? " " No . " There 's something so childlike about the way she looks up at me , anticipating the rest of my answer . I give it some thought . " You know , you should think about why you two fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you folded his T-shirts ? Or how you cook spaghetti ? " I 've smelled things burning over there , so I say , " I doubt it . You probably devoted every free minute you had to each other . But now you live together , and everything is reversed . Instead of anticipating what could happen next , you expect things to happen . Instead of making an effort to be together , you resent the time you spend on the couch . And love gets lost in the details . In the bills . The dishes . You take that stuff away , and you still love each other . . . " I 'm even impressing myself with this theory , and I think I can get through to her , but then I smell something else burning , and I notice she 's using my lighter to singe her arm hair . Jerry 's right , this girl is crazy . I take away the lighter and she starts to giggle . I ca n't tell if she 's laughing at me or at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Childlike is right . " Good luck . " I give up . I get up . " Can I ask a serious question ? " she asks before I can take a step past her . I wait for it . " How do you do it ? How do you make it work ? " Just then , her door opens about six inches and hangs there . Looks like Jerry has had a change of heart . The girl jumps up , leaving her shoes and her pills , forgetting all about me and how I make things work . The funny thing is , she would n't believe me if I told her . She 'd think I was crazy . The door closes behind them as I approach my place , feeling smart , and also regretting the fact that I 've never given anyone the power to lock me out . Continues ...
