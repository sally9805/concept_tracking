I Walk into a White Room // I walk into a large white room . It 's a dance studio in midtown Manhattan . I 'm wearing a sweatshirt , faded jeans , and Nike cross-trainers . The room is lined with eight-foot-high mirrors . There 's a boom box in the corner . The floor is clean , virtually spotless if you do n't count the thousands of skid marks and footprints left there by dancers rehearsing . Other than the mirrors , the boom box , the skid marks , and me , the room is empty . In five weeks I 'm flying to Los Angeles with a troupe of six dancers to perform a dance program for eight consecutive evenings in front of twelve hundred people every night . It 's my troupe . I 'm the choreographer . I have half of the program in hand - a fifty-minute ballet for all six dancers set to Beethoven 's twenty-ninth piano sonata , the " Hammerklavier . " I created the piece more than a year ago on many of these same dancers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the company . // The other half of the program is a mystery . I do n't know what music I 'll be using . I do n't know which dancers I 'll be working with . I have no idea what the costumes will look like , or the lighting , or who will be performing the music . I have no idea of the length of the piece , although it has to be long enough to fill the second half of a full program to give the paying audience its money 's worth . The length of the piece will dictate how much rehearsal time I need . This , in turn , means getting on the phone to dancers , scheduling studio time , and getting the ball rolling - all on the premise that something wonderful will come out of what I fashion in the next few weeks in this empty white room . // My dancers expect me to deliver because my choreography represents their livelihood . The presenters in Los Angeles expect the same because they 've sold a lot of tickets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interesting from me . The theater owner ( without really thinking about it ) expects it as well ; if I do n't show up , his theater will be empty for a week . That 's a lot of people , many of whom I 've never met , counting on me to be creative . // But right now I 'm not thinking about any of this . I 'm in a room with the obligation to create a major dance piece . The dancers will be here in a few minutes . What are we going to do ? // To some people , this empty room symbolizes something profound , mysterious , and terrifying : the task of starting with nothing and working your way toward creating something whole and beautiful and satisfying . It 's no different for a writer rolling a fresh sheet of paper into his typewriter ( or more likely firing up the blank screen on his computer ) , or a painter confronting a virginal canvas , a sculptor staring at a raw chunk of stone , a composer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people find this moment - the moment before creativity begins - so painful that they simply can not deal with it . They get up and walk away from the computer , the canvas , the keyboard ; they take a nap or go shopping or fix lunch or do chores around the house . They procrastinate . In its most extreme form , this terror totally paralyzes people . // The blank space can be humbling . But I 've faced it my whole professional life . It 's my job . It 's also my calling . Bottom line : Filling this empty space constitutes my identity . // I 'm a dancer and choreographer . Over the last 35 years , I 've created 130 dances and ballets . Some of them are good , some less good ( that 's an understatement - some were public humiliations ) . I 've worked with dancers in almost every space and environment you can imagine . I 've rehearsed in cow pastures . I 've rehearsed in hundreds of studios , some luxurious in their austerity and expansiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the edges of the room . I 've spent eight months on a film set in Prague , choreographing the dances and directing the opera sequences for Milos Forman 's Amadeus . I 've staged sequences for horses in New York City 's Central Park for the film Hair . I 've worked with dancers in the opera houses of London , Paris , Stockholm , Sydney , and Berlin . I 've run my own company for three decades . I 've created and directed a hit show on Broadway . I 've worked long enough and produced with sufficient consistency that by now I find not only challenge and trepidation but peace as well as promise in the empty white room . It has become my home . // After so many years , I 've learned that being creative is a full-time job with its own daily patterns . That 's why writers , for example , like to establish routines for themselves . The most productive ones get started early in the morning , when the world is quiet , the phones are n't ringing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet polluted by other people 's words . They might set a goal for themselves - write fifteen hundred words , or stay at their desk until noon - but the real secret is that they do this every day . In other words , they are disciplined . Over time , as the daily routines become second nature , discipline morphs into habit . // It 's the same for any creative individual , whether it 's a painter finding his way each morning to the easel , or a medical researcher returning daily to the laboratory . The routine is as much a part of the creative process as the lightning bolt of inspiration , maybe more . And this routine is available to everyone . // Creativity is not just for artists . It 's for businesspeople looking for a new way to close a sale ; it 's for engineers trying to solve a problem ; it 's for parents who want their children to see the world in more than one way . Over the past four decades , I have been engaged in one creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my personal life . I 've thought a great deal about what it means to be creative , and how to go about it efficiently . I 've also learned from the painful experience of going about it in the worst possible way . I 'll tell you about both . And I 'll give you exercises that will challenge some of your creative assumptions - to make you stretch , get stronger , last longer . After all , you stretch before you jog , you loosen up before you work out , you practice before you play . It 's no different for your mind . // I will keep stressing the point about creativity being augmented by routine and habit . Get used to it . In these pages a philosophical tug of war will periodically rear its head . It is the perennial debate , born in the Romantic era , between the beliefs that all creative acts are born of ( a ) some transcendent , inexplicable Dionysian act of inspiration , a kiss from God on your brow that allows you to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . // If it is n't obvious already , I come down on the side of hard work . That 's why this book is called The Creative Habit . Creativity is a habit , and the best creativity is a result of good work habits . That 's it in a nutshell . // The film Amadeus ( and the play by Peter Shaffer on which it 's based ) dramatizes and romanticizes the divine origins of creative genius . Antonio Salieri , representing the talented hack , is cursed to live in the time of Mozart , the gifted and undisciplined genius who writes as though touched by the hand of God . Salieri recognizes the depth of Mozart 's genius , and is tortured that God has chosen someone so unworthy to be His divine creative vessel . // Of course , this is hogwash . There are no " natural " geniuses . Mozart was his father 's son . Leopold Mozart had gone through an arduous education , not just in music , but also in philosophy and religion ; he was a sophisticated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedagogue . This is not news to music lovers . Leopold had a massive influence on his young son . I question how much of a " natural " this young boy was . Genetically , of course , he was probably more inclined to write music than , say , play basketball , since he was only three feet tall when he captured the public 's attention . But his first good fortune was to have a father who was a composer and a virtuoso on the violin , who could approach keyboard instruments with skill , and who upon recognizing some ability in his son , said to himself , " This is interesting . He likes music . Let 's see how far we can take this . " // Leopold taught the young Wolfgang everything about music , including counterpoint and harmony . He saw to it that the boy was exposed to everyone in Europe who was writing good music or could be of use in Wolfgang 's musical development . Destiny , quite often , is a determined parent . Mozart was hardly some naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God whispering in his ears , let the music flow from his fingertips . It 's a nice image for selling tickets to movies , but whether or not God has kissed your brow , you still have to work . Without learning and preparation , you wo n't know how to harness the power of that kiss . // Nobody worked harder than Mozart . By the time he was twenty-eight years old , his hands were deformed because of all the hours he had spent practicing , performing , and gripping a quill pen to compose . That 's the missing element in the popular portrait of Mozart . Certainly , he had a gift that set him apart from others . He was the most complete musician imaginable , one who wrote for all instruments in all combinations , and no one has written greater music for the human voice . Still , few people , even those hugely gifted , are capable of the application and focus that Mozart displayed throughout his short life . As Mozart himself wrote to a friend , " People err who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , dear friend , nobody has devoted so much time and thought to composition as I. There is not a famous master whose music I have not industriously studied through many times . " Mozart 's focus was fierce ; it had to be for him to deliver the music he did in his relatively short life , under the conditions he endured , writing in coaches and delivering scores just before the curtain went up , dealing with the distractions of raising a family and the constant need for money . Whatever scope and grandeur you attach to Mozart 's musical gift , his so-called genius , his discipline and work ethic were its equal . // I 'm sure this is what Leopold Mozart saw so early in his son who , as a three-year-old , one day impulsively jumped up on the stool to play his older sister 's harpsichord - and was immediately smitten . Music quickly became Mozart 's passion , his preferred activity . I seriously doubt that Leopold had to tell his son for very long , " Get in there and practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . // More than anything , this book is about preparation : In order to be creative you have to know how to prepare to be creative . // No one can give you your subject matter , your creative content ; if they could , it would be their creation and not yours . But there 's a process that generates creativity - and you can learn it . And you can make it habitual . // There 's a paradox in the notion that creativity should be a habit . We think of creativity as a way of keeping everything fresh and new , while habit implies routine and repetition . That paradox intrigues me because it occupies the place where creativity and skill rub up against each other . // It takes skill to bring something you 've imagined into the world : to use words to create believable lives , to select the colors and textures of paint to represent a haystack at sunset , to combine ingredients to make a flavorful dish . No one is born with that skill . It is developed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflection that 's both painstaking and rewarding . And it takes time . Even Mozart , with all his innate gifts , his passion for music , and his father 's devoted tutelage , needed to get twenty-four youthful symphonies under his belt before he composed something enduring with number twenty-five . If art is the bridge between what you see in your mind and what the world sees , then skill is how you build that bridge . // That 's the reason for the exercises . They will help you develop skill . Some might seem simple . Do them anyway - you can never spend enough time on the basics . Before he could write Cosi fan tutte , Mozart had practiced his scales . // While modern dance and ballet are my m ? tier , they are not the subject of this book . I promise you that the text will not be littered with dance jargon . You will not be confused by first positions and plies and tendus in these pages . I will assume that you 're a reasonably sophisticated and open-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seen a dance company in action on stage . If you have n't , shame on you ; that 's like admitting you 've never read a novel or strolled through a museum or heard a Beethoven symphony live . If you give me that much , we can work together . // The way I figure it , my work habits are applicable to everyone . You 'll find that I 'm a stickler about preparation . My daily routines are transactional . Everything that happens in my day is a transaction between the external world and my internal world . Everything is raw material . Everything is relevant . Everything is usable . Everything feeds into my creativity . But without proper preparation , I can not see it , retain it , and use it . Without the time and effort invested in getting ready to create , you can be hit by the thunderbolt and it 'll just leave you stunned . // Take , for example , a wonderful scene in the film The Karate Kid . The teenaged Daniel asks the wise and wily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees and orders Daniel first to wax his car in precisely opposed circular motions ( " Wax on , wax off " ) . Then he tells Daniel to paint his wooden fence in precise up and down motions . Finally , he makes Daniel hammer nails to repair a wall . Daniel is puzzled at first , then angry . He wants to learn the martial arts so he can defend himself . Instead he is confined to household chores . When Daniel is finished restoring Miyagi 's car , fence , and walls , he explodes with rage at his " mentor . " Miyagi physically attacks Daniel , who without thought or hesitation defends himself with the core thrusts and parries of karate . Through Miyagi 's deceptively simple chores , Daniel has absorbed the basics of karate - without knowing it . //
