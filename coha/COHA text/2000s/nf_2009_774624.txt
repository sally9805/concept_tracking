SEEGER ? S POLITICS are of the most extravagantly conservative kind . He believes ardently in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . His interpretation of them is literal . In his years of activism , through the movements for workers ? rights , civil rights , the movement against the Vietnam War , and the ecological movement , in all of which he figured prominently , there is no conceit that he has more emphatically embraced than that all human beings are created equal and have equal rights . In the early and middle parts of the twentieth century , such a conviction made a person not a patriot , but a socialist . When Seeger moved to Beacon , in 1949 , he held a couple of meetings with a middle- age couple , the only other Communists around , then quit the party . " I thought it was pointless , " he said . " I realized I could sing the same songs I sang whether I belonged to the Communist Party or not , and I never liked the idea anyway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went out and looked at the river , and I could see where Seeger had been standing , in 1955 , when a car arrived , and the man driving it asked if he was Pete Seeger . Then he handed Seeger an envelope and left . Seeger opened the envelope and called out to Toshi , " They ? ve finally got around to me . " He had been summoned to testify before the House Un- American Activities Committee , in August . // Toshi found a lawyer who told Seeger that the option most commonly invoked was to cite the Fifth Amendment , which would lead to the case ? s being dismissed . Seeger didn ? t care for the inference of guilt that the gesture implied . People who had done so were sometimes described as " Fifth Amendment Communists . " The lawyer also said that Seeger could choose to talk about himself to the committee but refuse to talk about other people . " I had known I could do that , " Seeger told me , " because my father , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job inWashington when the FBI came and spoke to him , and he said , ? I ? m willing to undress myself in a sentence , but I ? m not going to tell about anyone else I know. ? They said , ? You ? ve got to tell about everyone. ? He said he wasn ? t willing to do that . He knew he would be fired , so he walked in the next morning and resigned . He was head of the music department of the Pan American Union . He ? d hoped to hang on for a few years , since he hadn ? t the savings , but he closed down his house  --  a great big house that he ? d raised four kids in  --  and his wife had just died a few months earlier , and my sister was going to Radcliffe , so he went up and got a crowded little apartment in Cambridge . Anyway , the lawyer told me if , at the hearing , I answered the question , ? Are you a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ? Who did you know ? ? " // The third choice was to rely on the First Amendment , which guarantees freedom of speech and " the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . " The Hollywood Ten , a group of screenwriters and producers , had tried this in 1947 , and been convicted of contempt , jailed for a year , and then blacklisted . Employing this tactic , Seeger might spend years in court , have his career ruined , and still go to jail . The lawyer left the choice to Seeger . He told him not to bait the committee , to be polite , to answer their questions , or say why he wouldn ? t . Refusing to answer would result in a contempt citation , and each citation could be worth a year in jail . As the hearing approached , the lawyer reviewed with Seeger the questions he was likely to be asked . // Seeger appeared before the committee , in New York , on August 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee counsel ; Representative Francis Walter , the chairman ; Gordon Scherer , a congressman from Ohio and a former prosecutor ; and Edwin Willis , a congressman from Louisiana . " They were small- town politicians , " Seeger said . " Walter was a lawyer from the coal country . " // Seeger wore a tweed jacket , a plaid shirt , a yellow tie , and dark pants . Toshi sat in the audience , with his banjo . The men asked what Seeger did for a living . Student of American folklore , he said , but he made his living as " a banjo picker . " Before going into the Army , had he practiced his profession ? // " It is hard to call it a profession , " Seeger said . " I kind of drifted into it and I never intended to be a musician , and I am glad I am one now , and it is a very honorable profession , but when I started out actually I wanted to be a newspaperman , and when I left school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ? " Tavenner asked . // " I have to explain that it really wasn ? t my profession , " Seeger said . " I picked up a little change in it . " // " Did you practice your profession ? " // " I sang for people , yes , before World War II , and I also did as early as 1925. " // " And upon your return from the service in December of 1945 , you continued in your profession ? " // " I continued singing , and I expect I always will , " Seeger said . // Tavenner was maneuvering Seeger toward admitting that he had sung for the Communist Party . Then he would ask him to name all the other people who had done the same thing or to name people who had listened to him . He referred to an announcement in the Daily Worker from 1947 which read , " Tonight  --  Bronx , hear Peter Seeger and his guitar , at Allerton Section housewarming . " Was the Allerton Section a section of the Communist Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When pressed , he said , " I am not going to answer any questions as to my association , my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs , or how I voted in any election , or any of these private affairs . I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked , especially under such compulsion as this . I would be very glad to tell you my life if you want to hear of it . " // They didn ? t . Tavenner asked instead if Seeger had performed at a May Day Rally in 1948. // " I believe I have already answered this question , and the same answer , " Seeger said . // Walter asked what that answer was . // " I feel that in my whole life I have never done anything of any conspiratorial nature , " Seeger said , " and I resent very much and very deeply the implication of being called before this committee that in some way because my opinions may be different from yours , or yours , Mr. Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any less of an American than anybody else . I love my country very deeply , sir . " // " Why don ? t you make a little contribution toward preserving its institutions ? " Walter asked . // " I feel that my whole life is a contribution , " Seeger said . " That is why I would like to tell you about it . " // " I don ? t want to hear about it , " Walter said . // Scherer asked that Seeger be directed to answer , a formality . Each time a witness was directed to answer and didn ? t , he was regarded as being in contempt . Seeger said he had already answered . // " Let me understand , " Scherer said . " You are not relying on the Fifth Amendment , are you ? " // " No , sir , " Seeger said , " although I do not want to in any way discredit or depreciate or depredate the witnesses that have used the Fifth Amendment , and I simply feel it is improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then in answering the rest of the questions , " Scherer said , " or in refusing to answer the rest of the questions , I understand that you are not relying on the Fifth Amendment as a basis for your refusal to answer ? " // " No , I am not , sir . " // Tavenner continued to ask about events where Seeger was said to have taken part . Seeger would say , " My answer is the same as before , " and Scherer would say , " I think we have to have a direction . " When a song was mentioned , Seeger would offer to sing it , and he would be rebuffed . // Some ways into their discourse , Tavenner gave Seeger a photograph , taken at a May Day parade in New York , in 1952 , in which Seeger is wearing an Army uniform , and carrying a sign that says " Censored . " // " Will you examine it , please , and state whether or not that is a photograph of you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is like Jesus Christ when asked by Pontius Pilate , ? Are you king of the Jews ? ? " Seeger said . // As if admonishing a child , Chairman Walter said , " Stop that . " // " Let someone else identify that picture , " Seeger said . // " I ask that he be directed to answer the question , " Scherer said . // " I direct you to answer the question , " Chairman Walter said . // " Do I identify this photograph ? " Seeger asked . Walter said , " Yes . " // " I say let someone else identify it . " //
