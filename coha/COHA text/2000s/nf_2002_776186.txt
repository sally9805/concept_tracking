VILLAGES AND COMPOUNDS // In 1948 , when I was born , most of Afghanistan might as well have been living in Neolithic times . It was a world of walled villages , each one inhabited by a few large families , themselves linked in countless ways through intermarriages stretching into the dim historical memories of the eldest elders . These villages had no cars , no carts even , no wheeled vehicles at all ; no stores , no shops , no electricity , no postal service , and no media except rumors , storytelling , and the word of travelers passing through . Virtually all the men were farmers . Virtually all the women ran the households and raised the children . Virtually all boys grew up to be like their fathers and all girls like their mothers . The broad patterns of life never changed , never had as far as any living generation could remember , and presumably never would . People lived pretty much as they had eight thousand years ago . // That was the countryside . The big cities , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century or so . And the biggest city , Kabul , where my family lived , had made it to the twentieth century , but just barely . Cars were few , roads were unpaved , and public transportation consisted mostly of gadis  --  horse-drawn two-wheeled carriages . Electricity was scarce , too . Most of us used kerosene lanterns at night . There was no running water . We all had wells . There was no garbage service . We did n't produce any garbage . Hundreds of thousands of people lived in the city , but the houses had no numbers and the streets had no names . If you did n't know where you were going , you probably had no business going there . A postal service existed , but it did n't deliver to private homes unless the mailman felt like it , and he felt like it only if he knew you or had heard of you . Yet even with hundreds of thousands of people in the city , the postman very possibly had heard of you . Oh , not you in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd know the branch , the trunk , the tree itself : your people . // Everybody in the city lived in a compound , a yard surrounded by walls that divided the world into a public and a private realm . That 's the main fact I want to get across about the lost world I grew up in : It was not divided into a men 's world and a women 's world ; the division was between public and private . Visitors never really knew us , because they never saw the hidden world inside our compounds . Those who came from the West did n't even know our private universe existed , or that life inside it was warm and sweet . And in a way , we Afghans did n't know we had this realm either , because we did n't know it was possible not to have it . // In the compounds , people spent all their time with the group . As far as I can tell , none of my Afghan relatives was ever alone or ever wanted to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the West . Because I write for a living , I spend most of my waking hours alone in my basement office . Oh , I jog , do errands , see people I know  --  but mostly , it 's just a man and his thoughts in a blur of urban landscape . If I 'm too much with other people , I need to balance it with some downtime . Most of the people I know are like this . We need solitude , because when we 're alone , we 're free from obligations , we do n't need to put on a show , and we can hear our own thoughts . // My Afghan relatives achieved this same state by being with one another . Being at home with the group gave them the satisfactions we associate with solitude  --  ease , comfort , and the freedom to let down one 's guard . The reason for this is hard to convey , but I 'm going to try . Namely , our group self was just as real as our individual selves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term properly applies to this type of group . Family does n't cover it . Even extended family feels too small . Tribe , however , is too big . I 'm inclined to hijack the term clan from anthropology , although even that is not quite right , because the type of group I 'm talking about was not a formal entity , had no organization , no name , no recognized chief , and no exact boundaries . It was more like a loose network of extended families tied together by a mutual sense of having descended from a great someone in the past  --  or a string of great someones. // Our group , for example , looked back to Sa'aduddin , a landowner who lived in the nineteenth century and wrote mystical poetry under the pen name Shuri Ishq  --  " Turmoil of Love . " He was my great-great-grandfather . Of course , Americans too might have a sense of identity based on a famous ancestor , but the Afghan experience differs from the American one , because Afghans prefer to marry their relatives . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in Afghanistan , the ideal marriage is between first cousins . Therefore , in Afghanistan , the lines of descent from an important man tend to keep curling back toward the center , endlessly weaving a coherent entity through intermarriage . And that 's the entity I 'll call a " clan " from now on , because " network of extended families descended from a great someone " is too cumbersome . // We tended to feel more at home with others of our own large group than we did with strangers , and the Afghan tradition of living in compounds deepened this tendency . Once we stepped into one of our compounds , in those days , each of us had a different name from the one we used outside . These names were called luqubs and were all constructed of the same few words  --  flower , lion , sugar , lord , lady , sweet , and so on , combined with uncle , aunt , papa , mama , and the like . My mother 's name , for example , was Khanim Gul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound , the old , young , and middle-aged  --  men , women , girls , and boys  --  all shared the same space . Living quarters were n't divided into your space and his space and my space . People did n't have places to keep their possessions  --  few , in fact , had much in the way of possessions : it was n't a thing-centered world . By day , thin mattresses arranged along the perimeters of the rooms served as furniture . At night , blankets were pulled out of closets and those same mattresses were rearranged in the center of the floor as beds. // At mealtime , any room could become the dining room . A tablecloth would be spread on the floor . Everyone would wash their hands thoroughly and eat with them from a common platter , packed together so tightly around the food on the tablecloth that their oneness was a physical experience , a circle of people who were all touching . // Instead of television , we had genealogy . The elders , the white-headed ones , spent endless hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So-and-so married so-and-so , and then their progeny got sorted into these other branches through marriage , so actually your cousin Saliq is your second cousin through Sweet Daddy  --  and so on . It might not sound exciting , but remember that genealogy was the warp and family stories the woof of the fabric that made us one entity . // We did n't spend much time pondering Islam . We did n't have to . Islam permeated the life of the compound like the custard that binds a casserole together , hardly separable from ordinary daily life . Five times a day , some of us did our ablutions and moved into the prayer ritual , one by one , at our own pace . Prayer divided a day into five parts and gave a sort of rhythm to the household , like breathing in , holding for quiet , and then breathing out , releasing back into noise and activity . There was no Ministry of Vice and Virtue . No one was under the gun to pray ; it was not an obligation , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who did n't pray lowered their speaking voices out of respect for those who did , and we youngsters learned not to be doing our naughtiness near a person who was praying , so that we would n't embarrass them by seeing the undignified sight they presented when they got on their hands and knees and touched their forehead to the floor . // In winter , the intervals were shorter ; in summer , longer . Some men went to the mosque on Fridays , but that was n't the locus of Islam in old Afghanistan : It was everywhere . The rhythm of prayer suffused the city , the whole society , all the villages , all the world , as far as we were aware . With so many people praying at once , at home , in the courtyards , in public buildings , five times daily , prayer became the respiration of a whole society calming down at intervals in a rhythm set not by any clock but by the light of nature . // Now let me place my family in this scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was American . She met my father in Chicago , where the Afghan government had sent him to acquire Western knowledge . My father , Amanuddin , was the fourth of five brothers and the second of the five to be sent abroad for such an education . He learned to read and write from the village mullah and entered the government school as a sixth grader , and it was just about then that the royal family decided Afghanistan needed Western know-how . My father 's elder brother Najmuddin got one of the first of the government scholarships to a university in the West , but the year after he left , a terrible event cut the scholarship program short , an event that my father witnessed . Indeed , this event almost cost my father his life . // He was in seventh grade at the time . He and other worthy students from several Kabul high schools had been called to the palace for an awards ceremony , during which , one of my father 's classmates stepped out of the ranks and shot the monarch dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinny figure with small round spectacles , had ruled for only a few years . Although his clan had owned the throne for some 150 years , his particular family had been an outlying branch until the third Afghan-British war , from which Nadir emerged as a war hero . A few years later , a bandit known as " the Water-Carrier 's Son " led a revolt against the monarchy and drove King Amanullah out of the country . Nadir , however , took the field and routed the rebels . But instead of handing the throne back to Amanullah , he claimed it for himself . Some families in the royal clan regarded Nadir as an usurper . The boy who killed him belonged to one of these . // As soon as the bodyguards saw the king fall , they locked the courtyard gates and prepared to shoot down all the students . But the king 's son , the teenaged prince Zahir Shah , who had flung himself upon his father 's warm corpse in shock and grief , had the presence of mind  --  and humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fire . My father owed his life to that prince , and I guess I do , too , indirectly . Perhaps this is why I have always felt such affection and respect for Zahir Shah , who was king of Afghanistan throughout my years there , the same king who was called out of exile after the Taliban collapsed , to preside over his country as a symbol of unity . // My father was one of five students sent to the United States the first year the scholarship program was resumed . He got his bachelor 's degree from the University of Illinois and then studied at Stanford for a couple of weeks , but when he tried to find housing on the West Coast , landlords slammed their doors on him , snarling , " We do n't rent to Japs ! " This was during World War II , and my father 's Mongolian blood showed somewhat in his features . // This contempt for his bloodline must have shocked him . In Afghanistan , no matter what reversals he might suffer or how low he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him  --  his bloodline . He was an Ansary , descended from one of those families in seventh-century Arabia who helped the Prophet Muhammad escape from Mecca to Medina . The Arabic word ansar means " helper , " and descendants of those families have been known ever since as Ansarys. // Having encountered no racism in the Midwest , my father returned to the University of Chicago to pursue his Ph.D . in education . He lived in a boardinghouse with his hometown buddies , Shalizi , Taraki , Kayeum , and Asghar. // Downstairs in that same boardinghouse lived a shy first-generation Finnish-American girl named Terttu Palm : brown sausage-curl bangs , plump cheeks , a Clara Bow mouth , and the modest clothes of a girl who did n't consider herself pretty . She had grown up in the Finnish community of Chicago , speaking nothing but Finnish until she went to school , and even then her social world remained mainly Finnish , with a smattering of Russian in the mix . As a teenager , her idea of fun was attending dances at the Finnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ( although I get the impression that she was mostly a wallflower , alas ) . Her dreamboats were never the athletes or the fast-talking boys who smoked and drank , but the boys who could trip the light fantastic . // She had just finished teachers college and was living on her own for the first time , free from the shadow of her domineering father , supporting herself as an elementary school teacher , and hungering for life , when my father moved in upstairs . She idolized artists , bohemians , and all things exotic , and the Afghan boys attracted her like honey . She told me once that she did n't single out my father ; she just wanted one of those Afghan boys , she did n't know which one . // My father looked like a skinny Gregory Peck , with a touch of the Mongolian horseman in his features . Stylish in his wide suits , big ties , and snazzy hats , he had a devil-may-care , artiste air about him . But he really emerged from the pack when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters of my parents ' story are shrouded in mist , and when the fog lifts , they 're married . // Their wedding took place in the sixth year of my father 's American adventure , and it got him in trouble . Before he left Afghanistan , he had signed a contract not to marry a foreigner , an act already prohibited by the Afghan constitution . As soon as he married my mother , the government recalled him , cutting his education short . // Afghanistan shocked my mother deeply at first . She did a lot of crying that first year . She could not be reconciled to living only in the world behind the walls . She wanted to go home  --  but not without my father . // The royal government wanted her to go home , too  --  but not with my father , whom they had spent a fortune educating . They ordered my father to send her back , but the Ansarys got together and decided they could not let outsiders dictate to them in this matter of their womenfolk , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what my mother thought about this bravery on her behalf , since she was longing to leave Afghanistan , but in any case , she stayed . // With my grandmother leading the way , the family took her in as the Permanent Guest , always to be honored , loved , and cared for . Afghan society settled on treating her as an exception to the rules of gender : She was considered neither female nor male , but American . She never wore a chad'ri ( the body-length veil now commonly known as the burqa ) , and she soon began to work outside the compound . The government had just started the country 's first girls school , and my mother set about teaching Afghan girls to speak English . Since the role of teacher was an honored , almost sacred , one in Afghan society , she carved a place for herself as " teacher-sir " to a generation of women . // I have to say that in the Afghan context , the government cut her a lot of slack . Once , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal came to her , shocked and concerned , and said , " You ca n't fail those girls ; they 're high up in the royal family . " // My mother replied sassily , " Well , in that case , I do n't need to teach the class . Just tell me the rank of each student , so I can give her the appropriate grade , and we can all go home . " // My father came in afterward to settle the ruffled feathers and smooth things over . I imagine he did a lot of that . He was a patient man , quietly humorous , prone to sudden enthusiasms , but usually distracted by ideas going on his mind  --  much the same impression my children have of me , I think , except for the part about patience . He liked to putter in his elaborate garden far more than he did mixing it up in the rough-and-tumble of political life . His passion was literature , and he wrote poetry . So did all my uncles , but my father went a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught literature at the brand new Kabul University and eventually served as dean of that college . // It took him a few years to get his career started . The government punished him at first for marrying a foreigner by refusing to employ him in any official capacity . But then the four other scholarship students in his class came back , and three of them brought home foreign wives ( they cannily put off marrying their girlfriends until they had gotten their doctorates ) . The government gave up , forgave them all , amended the constitution , and gave my father his first teaching post . // Around that time , a new quarter of the city was opened to development , and a lottery was held for the right to buy parcels there . By some amazing coincidence , as my mother put it thirty years later , all four of the men with foreign wives won that lottery . The words were halfway out of her mouth before she realized that coincidence probably had nothing to do with it . // My sister Rebecca was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like my mother , we had a special place in the clan . We were right at the heart of it , although contained somewhat in the nuclear household my mother maintained within the Ansary social universe . At home , we did n't sit on the floor like other Ansarys ; we had tables and chairs . We ate odd things like spaghetti , and we did so with silverware , not our hands . So when dining with other branches of the clan , we came in for some affectionate jesting , because eating with one 's hand is , in fact , a refined and difficult skill , and we could n't do it very well . // Rebecca and I shared a bedroom , and I have a cellular memory of our whispering together after the lights went out . When she fell asleep and left me alone in the dark , three feet away , I sometimes saw monsters on my eyelids and had to wake her up with my screams . She took care of me like a peppery , pint-sized mommy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was boss . And I liked it that way . She was our envoy to the adult world , marching out there to get the information we needed to know and then bringing it back to share with me . Apparently , we could communicate with each other before I could officially talk . I believe that early on I did n't have a clear sense of where I ended and she began . I 'm told that if I was ever given candy , I automatically saved half for her . " What a sweet , unselfish boy , " grown-ups said . But really I was only saving half the candy for my other mouth . Nothing unselfish about it , once you knew who the self was . // My mother stocked her nest as best she could with American items , which included canned foods , cocoa , classical music records , and books . One spring , when I was five or six , my sister taught me the English alphabet . By that fall , when my mother sat down to teach me phonics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except sugar and enough . I think I learned to read because I had such a hunger for stories . My cousins drank their fill of these from my grandmother and other family storytellers , but since Rebecca and I lived somewhat separately from the others , I had to make up the deficiency with books . Soon , in addition to Afghanistan , I had a rich , imaginary , English-speaking world to live in . For a time , the grown-ups nicknamed me " Professor . " // Our compound at the edge of the city was pretty typical for progressive Afghans of our social status in that day : an acre or so surrounded by a mud-brick wall about nine feet high , which kept strangers from peeking in on us and kept us from looking out , too , at ground level anyway . In the most traditional compounds , the buildings were attached to the perimeter walls , and these walls and buildings surrounded and protected an inner courtyard . Each compound had a front room for entertaining male visitors unrelated to the family . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any glimpse of the inner courtyard , the private world . In our compound , however , the main house was in the middle of the yard , because we were moving away from this preoccupation with keeping our women hidden from strangers . // We did , however , have buildings along our perimeter walls . A long row of rooms lined one outer wall , and each of them opened directly onto the yard  --  the outhouse , storerooms for extra bedding , wood and coal , onions and potatoes ( which we kept buried in mounds of soil for freshness ) . // There were other buildings , as well , all made of sun-baked brick . We had a sizable separate one-room building for any poor relation who might be living with us at any given time ( and there was almost always someone ) . We had a two-room suite with its own little kitchen  --  a room with a smoke hole and a fire pit  --  where a succession of families unrelated to us lived . They were our kinar-nisheen , " those who dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feudal system , poor people who depended on my father 's patronage . As often as not , the father had some job of his own out in the world , but the wife and older children worked for us. // Although not strictly traditional , our compound was still a world apart . From the strawberry patch at the center of our yard , I could see nothing beyond the walls except mountains and sky  --  far to the south , the Safid Mountains , a jagged row of broken teeth , snowcapped all year round , the whites as sharp against the blue rocks as if etched with a needle point , a testament to the purity of Kabul 's ( then ) unpolluted air . To the east , looming hulks spilled in from two directions , pinching the city almost in half . The Kabul River cut a narrow notch through this " Lion 's Gate Mountain , " and beyond the notch lay the busy chaos of downtown . Our side was mostly residential , and closer to us was a rock that looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our yard at certain hours , with Kabul University nestled between its flanks . // Our compound had two doors . One opened onto a plain , where boys from around the city came to fly their kites on Fridays and bands of nomads camped with their sheep , camels , and dogs . The other door opened onto an alley that wound among thirty or forty compounds before reaching a main thoroughfare . In that alley , we boys from the various compounds would play soccer and a form of cricket . Our bat was a stick carved from a tree branch , and our ball was a wad of rags wrapped in twine . // This alley , a dirt lane without pavement or sidewalks , was flanked by two continuous nine- or ten-foot-high adobe wails , which were punctuated by doors , each one decorative and different . // Much of urban and even village Afghanistan had the narrow , hemmed-in feeling of this lane . Everything that made life worth living was private , and the splendid secret was there behind every door along that lane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors down from ours , and if you made it into the privacy of their compound , voil ?  --  cherry blossoms , vegetables , flowering acacia trees , family , relatives , and retainers  --  just like ours . The same was true of both Shalizi 's compound and Taraki's. // We knew these compounds well because Shalizi , Kayeum , and Taraki were three of the four men who had gone to America with my father , and all had foreign wives . The Kayeums were especially close to us because my father and Kayeum were best friends , Kayeum and his wife , Joan , had five children , including Rona , a girl about my age . The Kayeum children were almost like siblings to Rebecca and me. // ( Continues ... ) //
