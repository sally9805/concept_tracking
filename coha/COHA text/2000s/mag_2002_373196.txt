Susan Pierres , a Miami photojournalist who just turned 60 , is confused and angry . Ten years ago , when she was approaching menopause , her doctor started her on hormone-replacement therapy , or HRT . " I did n't have any symptoms , " she recalls , " but he recommended it for general well-being , bones and heart . " Many years and pills later , her gynecologist suggested that perhaps it was time to stop . After all , there had been reports that HRT might increase a woman 's risk of breast cancer , a disease that had afflicted Pierres ' mother and aunt . She turned to several other physicians for advice . They could n't seem to agree . Now comes word from a really big study that taking HRT for years at a stretch is n't such a great idea after all . <P> Should Pierres believe these latest results or go back to her doctor for an explanation ? Which doctor ? It 's not as though she 's all that eager to get off hormones : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if my skin turns scaly and my hair falls out ? " she worries . " These are complicated matters . People like me do n't know where to go or whom to listen to . " <P> Whom indeed . For decades , millions of women like Pierres have been told that HRT is a veritable fountain of youth . It kept the skin supple , held back heart disease , boosted old and brittle bones and might even have staved off senile dementia . More than 40% of all women in the U.S. start some form of HRT in their menopause years . Many of them continue well into their 70s and 80s , convinced that the little pills give them a youthful glow . <P> Like latter-day Ponce de Leons , however , these women are watching their dream of eternal youth fade away . A large , federally funded clinical trial , part of a group of studies called the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) , has definitively shown for the first time that the hormones in question  --  estrogen and progestin  --  are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that were n't bad enough , the results , made public last week , proved that taking these hormones together for more than a few years actually increases a woman 's risk of developing potentially deadly cardiovascular problems and invasive breast cancer , among other things . <P> As with any major medical announcements , there are caveats and complications . The WHI was n't designed to look at short-term use during menopause , for instance . But the principal message is this : taking estrogen and progestin for years in the hope of preventing a heart attack or stroke can no longer be considered a valid medical strategy . ( For a detailed look at the pros and cons of hormone therapy for various conditions , see the chart on pages 38 and 39 . ) <P> Here at last is a rare moment of clarity . The debate over the long-term benefits and risks of HRT has lasted for decades . Now we have at least a few concrete answers . <P> The findings are so striking that the study was stopped three years short of its scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at how estrogen alone affects women with hysterectomies , are still proceeding . ) And the formal scientific report , which is being published in this week 's Journal of the American Medical Association , was released a week early at a press conference in Washington .
