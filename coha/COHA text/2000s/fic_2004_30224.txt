" Rosato &; Associates , " Mary DiNunzio said into the receiver , then kicked herself for answering the phone . The caller was Premenstrual Tom , a man who wanted to sue the Philadelphia Police Department , the United States Congress , and a local cantaloupe . He 'd been calling the office at all hours , and Mary felt sorry for him . He was obviously off his meds and had reached one of the few lawyers in the city who would n't sue fruit . " This is Mr. Thomas Cott ! " he shouted . " Who 's this ? " " I 'm Mary DiNunzio . We spoke yesterday  --  " " Get me Ms. Benedetta Rosato ! " " Ms. Rosato is gone for the day , sir . " Mary checked her watch . 10:16 P.M. Everyone had gone home hours ago , and until now , the offices had been blessedly quiet . " The office is closed . " " Then what are you doing there , Ms. Mary DiNunzio ? " Good question , Mr. Thomas Cott . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes turned red and her contacts dried to the crispness of breakfast cereal . Documents blanketed the conference table like a legal snowstorm , and her compact figure had been curled into the swivel chair for so long she felt like a meatball . " Mr. Cott , I 'll take a message and tell Bennie  --  " " I refuse to leave any more messages ! Get Ms. Benedetta Rosato on the line ! I demand to know why she wo n't represent me ! She specializes in constitutional rights , it says so on the computer ! " " The computer ? " " In the library ! The website , your website ! It says it right there ! That 's false advertising ! What about my constitutional rights ? They do n't matter ? I do n't matter ? " " Mr. Cott , no lawyer can take every case , " Mary answered , then hesitated . Bennie had told the associates not to engage Premenstrual Tom , but if she could explain it to him , maybe he 'd stop calling . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail in court . She 's practiced constitutional law for a long time and has excellent judgment , so  --  " " All those judges are in on it ! All of them are crooked , every single one of them ! City Hall is a pit of conspiracy and corruption ! They 're all in the mayor 's pocket ! " " Mr. Cott , the judges in City Hall are n't crooked , and your case would be in federal court anyway  --  " " You 're not fooling me , either of you ! Put Ms. Benedetta Rosato on the telephone right now ! I know she 's there ! She must be , she 's not at home ! " Mary blinked . " How do you know she 's  --  " " I went to her house ! I knocked on her door , I waited for her to answer ! The windows were dark ! " Mary stiffened . " How did you get her address ? " " It 's in the phone book , I looked it up ! What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy law degree , but I am not incapable , MS . MARY DiNUNZIO ! " Mary suddenly stopped feeling sorry for him . He was shouting louder now , almost screaming . " I SAID , get MS . BENEDETTA ROSATO on this telephone RIGHT NOW ! I KNOW she 's right there with you ! " " Mr. Cott , if you 'll just  --  " " DO N'T LIE TO ME ! Do n't you DARE LIE TO ME ! " " Mr. Cott , I 'm not  --  " " I 'll come down there , you LYING WHORE ! I 'll come down there and SHOOT  --  " Mary hung up , shaken . The conference room fell abruptly silent . The air felt charged . It took her a moment to process what had just happened . Okay , Premenstrual Tom had morphed into Psychotic Tom , and it was n't funny anymore . Bennie was at an ACLU dinner , but it would be ending soon . She could be going home . Mary had to warn her . She reached for the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The phone rang underneath Mary 's hand , jarring her . Rrrriiinng ! She gritted her teeth and let it ring twice more so voicemail would pick up . She should never have engaged Premenstrual Tom . When would she learn ? Her goodgirl reflexes  --  Help Out , Be Nice , Tell the Truth  --  sucked in the practice of law . Mary pushed the button for her direct phone line and called Bennie , but there was no answer . She left a detailed message , then hung up , uneasy . She 'd call her back in five minutes to make sure the boss had gotten the message . Mary eased back in her swivel chair , wishing suddenly that she were n't alone in the office . She eyed the doorway to the conference room , surprised to find the threshold dark . Who turned out the lights in the reception area ? Maybe the cleaning people , when they 'd left . I 'll come down there and shoot Mary eyed the phone , daring it to ring again . She did n't leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages for evidence , in case the office had to go for a restraining order , like with Premenstrual Fred . Mary wondered fleetingly if she could find a career that did n't attract garden variety homicidal rage or bad television commercials . She told herself to get over it . Premenstrual Tom had been blowing off steam , and there was a security desk in the lobby of the building . The guard would n't let anybody upstairs without calling her first , especially after business hours , and nowadays you could n't get past the desk without a driver 's license and a mortgage note . She got back to work , tucking a dark blonde tendril into its loose French twist , and picking up the document she 'd been reading . It was a letter dated December 17 , 1941 , from the provost marshal general 's office , a federal agency that no longer existed . Its type was grainy because it was a Xerox copy of a photocopy of a carbon copy , and on another night , Mary would have gotten a charge out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the History Channel , but she loved the History Channel . Mary loved mostly everything on cable except The Actor 's Studio , which she would n't watch at gunpoint . But she did n't want to think about gunpoint right now ... Continues ...
