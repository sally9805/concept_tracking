Bill Vaughan 's first contribution to F &SF; was " The Wall " back in September of 1994 . Sadly , his second story is his last-Mr . Vaughan died of cancer in 2002 at the age of 59 . As a writer , he studied with Marta Randall and belonged to the Rogue workshop that splintered off after the class . His stories appeared in Analog and Writers of the Future . He was a software writer by trade and a beer drinker by avocation with a fondness for home brews ( especially sour-mash stout ) . A devoted student of Middle Eastern drumming , he was widely traveled but for " Mabiba Overboard " he stuck to the US-although the " U " in " US " is less relevant than it used to be ... <p> TELL US A STORY , GRANNIE .... There once was a woman , and her name was Zulaika . She was n't too young and she was n't too old , and she lived in Florida with her friend Mabiba . Florida it had been a big state once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made off with it entirely , there was n't a lot of Florida left . But there was a lot of ocean . It was shallow ocean , good for fish , and crabs , if you knew where to catch them so they were n't toxic . Mabiba and Zulaika made their living catching stuff . Fish and crabs mostly , but there was other stuff to catch too , stuff that could make you rich if no one saw you catch it . One day they were fishing near a sunken town called Melbourne . It was on what used to be the coast of Florida , but it was way out to sea now , and it took most of a day for Mabiba and Zulaika to get there from New Jax in Sadie . Sadie was their little boat . She was n't much - an old cabin cruiser , converted into a fishing boat . She had a little cabin with two berths and a head . It was a nice day . Spring or early summer , not hurricane season yet . The sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . You could nearly see down to the bottom - maybe forty , fifty feet in those days . Nowadays you could n't dive there without scuba ; it 's much too deep . In those days , you could n't dive with scuba . It was illegal . You could go to jail for possession of scuba gear . Or if they found an air compressor on your boat . Now when Zulaika was a little girl , she had read in a book all about ama divers - Japanese shellfish divers who lived long ago , before scuba was invented . They dived for oysters in deep water , sixty feet or more . Only women could do it - men did n't have enough stamina , or maybe they just were n't buoyant enough . The book did n't say . Zulaika thought that was great , something the boys could n't do , and she taught herself how to dive like the ama . And when she grew up , she taught her friend Mabiba , and they used to go out and dive for stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time it was Zulaika 's turn . She took a big stone and set it on the transom . That stone was tied onto the boat by a great long rope , longer than the distance to the bottom . She put on her goggles , little ones that pushed into her eye sockets so the pressure would n't pop her eyes out . She tied a safety line around her waist . Then she breathed - huff , puff , huff , puff - until she felt like she was going to faint , and when her face got all red and she felt dizzy , she grabbed the big stone and just fell , right into the water . The stone carried her down and down , and her head hurt , and she swallowed real fast so her eardrums would n't break , and the water pushed her chest in , and pushed the goggles into her eyes , and sooner than you could think it , she was on the bottom . Now here 's where a real ama diver would start to cut oysters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , she swam into a little drowned store . It was a jewelry store , and it still had stuff in it . Fish and crabs have no use for jewelry , so Zulaika and Mabiba were cleaning it out , a little bit at a time . Zulaika had just enough time to swim in , get some stuff , swim back to the stone , and pull on the rope . Then Mabiba hauled her up , faster than she could swim , and her ears popped and her chest puffed out , and she blew out her breath phoooo ! and she was on the surface . She climbed up the boarding ladder before she even got her breath back . " Look , " she said to Mabiba . " Gold coins . " " Where did you find them ? " Mabiba asked . " I thought we had the whole place cleaned out . " " Safe . " Zulaika was still breathing hard . " But .... How 'd you get it open ? " " Not that safe . Another one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it popped right open . I got these coins . Might be something else in there . I was out of air . " " My turn to dive , " said Mabiba . " I 'll check it out . " Down went Mabiba , and Zulaika counted the seconds as she waited to feel the tug on the rope . It was dangerous , ama diving . Just the air in your lungs - If Mabiba got hurt or stuck , she would drown unless Zulaika could pull her up by her safety line . But even the safety line was dangerous . It could get fouled on something , hold you on the bottom . So the women carried big knives to cut the line if something went wrong . And sometimes , things did go wrong . So far , they 'd been lucky , but some day their luck was bound to run out . So Zulaika 's heart would pound when her friend Mabiba was below . And now her heart was pounding even harder , because as she waited for Mabiba , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news . In the shipping lanes , the freighters and tankers would run you down without even looking , and further offshore there were pirates . Inshore , the other fishermen and crabbers would poach on your territory , cut your nets and steal your traps . And then there was the worst trouble of all - the Florida State Marine Police . This time , sure enough , it was the police . And Mabiba was still below , and by the time Zulaika had hauled her up , the police boat had pulled alongside . Three policemen they were , in a motor skiff . A good-sized twin-screw motor skiff , could make forty knots , maybe . Twice as fast as Sadie , for sure . One of the police - he looked like the boss - pulled out a bull horn . " You niggers ca n't dive here . This is a restricted area . " Nobody used that word anymore , not even in those days . That policeman might have been trying to talk tough , but it came out sounding funny - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zulaika did n't laugh . That man was holding a big twelve-gauge shotgun , and they did n't want to make him mad . " What you gals doin ' ? " he said . " You all fishin " in state waters without payin " your license , I bet . " " Need no license to fish in the ocean , " Mabiba said . " Shows what you know . By Florida state law , this here 's dry land . You all need a license . " The man held up some antique map that showed Florida sticking way out into the ocean . " It 's okay , officer , " said Zulaika . " Our license is up to date . We do plenty of " dry-land " fishing . " She went into Sadie 's little cabin and brought out the license to show him . " Not okay nohow , " said the policeman . " License or not , you ca n't dive on dry land . Maybe you looters . Maybe you got contraband on board , maybe scubas . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You turn out to be looters - well , you know what we do to looters . " " Got no scuba , " said Mabiba . " And the water 's too deep to skindive , you can see that . " " What you doin " in the water , then , sweet lips ? You all wet . No wet T-shirt contests out here . " The other policemen guffawed . One of them grabbed the bull horn and said , " You would n't win no prize neither . " " Trying to fix our prop shaft , " Zulaika said . " It 's fouled . We ran into somebody 's floating line , got to cut it all away . " " Maybe so , maybe no , " said the boss policeman , retrieving the bull horn . " Maybe you just fixin " your boat , maybe you looters . We comin " on board to see . Pat , Buddy , you board these gals " boat , you search everywhere , I mean everywhere . " He pointed the shotgun at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police boat alongside and the other two men jumped down onto Sadie 's deck . Those two policemen were called Patrick and Buddy . They had these cute little oval embroidered name badges , just like at the gas station . Patrick was tall and ugly , and Buddy was fat and ugly . And they had ugly manners to match . First thing when they got into the boat , Buddy tripped over that big stone and almost went sprawling . " What 's this big rock doing here for people to trip over ? " he yelled . He said some other stuff too , called that rock a bunch of names and all . " Hey , you watch what you say about our boat anchor , " said Zulaika . " Holds real good , specially in the mud . " " God , you sluts ca n't even afford a real anchor , " said Buddy . Patrick , he just laughed . The two of them searched Sadie stem to stern , high and low , and no scuba did they find . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little cabin , had hidden it pretty well . The policemen were n't too happy to find nothing . Buddy allowed as how there was always some violation to bust a body on , so they started to count up life jackets and all . But everything was okay . Patrick hollered back to the police boat that they had come up dry and asked for advice . Mr. Bull Horn , he said , " How about the crab pots ? " " Nothin " but crabs , " said Buddy . " Ice chests ? " " Just a few fish . Little ones . " " How about the head ? Maybe they hidin " drugs in it . " So Patrick marched into the cabin and pulled aside the curtain . He looked at the head and raised the lid . " Phew . Do n't you gals ever clean this thing ? " " Sometimes , " said Zulaika . Patrick eyed the head . He did n't look like he wanted to reach in there - I guess he 'd rather reach into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " This here toilet discharge over the side ? " " It does , " said Zulaika . " Ocean discharge is legal this far from shore , and I do n't mean that phony shoreline of yours . " " That 's true , little gal , " said Patrick . " Maybe we going to follow you all the way to New Jax harbor , make sure you do n't shit in our clean water there . But that 's not what I had in mind . I guess I need to take a whizz . " He unzipped his pants and peed in the toilet , right in front of Zulaika . Did n't put the seat up neither , and was n't any too careful about where he went . Then he pumped the head and flushed it , pumped the head and flushed it , pumped the head and flushed it . " There , " he said . " If there was anything in that shit-pot , it 's back on the bottom now . " " Could n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clogged the pump . Look at the sign . " A sign over the head said , Well , this Patrick , he just stood there and said , " You see something you like , little gal ? " Then he put his weenie back in his pants . Zulaika might have said a lot of things , but she did n't . Did n't want to make that policeman angry . She was just glad it was her in the cabin instead of Mabiba . No telling what Mabiba might have done-she had a temper on her . Patrick and Zulaika came out of the cabin , and Patrick hollered back to the police boat , " I did n't find nothin ' . These gals are clean . " " That so ? " said Mr. Bull Horn . " I saw you go in the cabin with that gal there , the one with the tits . You search her good ? " Buddy the policeman laughed . " Fuck you , " said Mabiba . " I seen that pencil dick of yours . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabiba , " said Zulaika , " you did n't have to say that . " But Patrick was turning red , and he was mad . " I think I 'm going to check their story , " he said , and he shucked his jacket and shoes and dove right overboard . " Oh , hell , " said Zulaika , and jumped right in after him . Sure enough , Patrick had n't spent much time looking at the prop shaft before he saw the little sack hanging by a line from the head 's discharge outlet . He swam for it , but Zulaika was faster . She snatched the sack , cut the line with her big knife , and swam for the boarding ladder . She reached it first , scrambled up , and pulled it up behind her . Buddy was a little slow to get the picture , but when he did , he went for Mabiba . That was a mistake . She grabbed the nearest crab pot and heaved the crabs right in his face , and while he was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the engine and pushed the throttle down . Sadie shot off as fast as she could go . The boss cop dropped his bull horn and fired his shotgun , but the women fell to the deck and the pellets missed them both . After a couple of minutes , Zulaika put her head up . The police boat was still dead in the water , and Buddy and Patrick were just beginning to climb on board . Zulaika changed course , and they headed off shore , for international waters . The police boat began to follow them . It put its bow up in the air and kicked up a dreadful spray . " I do n't think we 'll get there before they catch us , " said Mabiba . " I better get the bottles . " " You do that , " said Zulaika . " But wait till they get nearby . Do n't worry about that shotgun ; they ca n't fire at us through their own bow . Hell , they ca n't hardly see us . " Mabiba reached down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles . They had stoppers on them , and they were connected together with several meters of rigging wire . As the police boat approached , Mabiba stood on the afterdeck , whirling one of the bottles around her head . It made a noise-a deep humming roar-you could even hear it over the engines . The police boat got close and changed course as if to pull alongside . As it turned , Zulaika could see the boss cop , standing up on the foredeck and trying to get a bead on them with his shotgun . He fired at them as Mabiba threw the bottles . A few pellets rattled on Sadie 's deck , but Mabiba and Zulaika were unharmed . The police boat came closer . The bottles bobbed in the water on either side of its path . The cop took aim again . Then came a terrible screeching noise , and the police boat began to run in tight , fast circles . The boss cop was thrown off the foredeck , shotgun flying . " Got him ! " shouted Mabiba . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the bottles and the rigging wire had fouled one of its screws , maybe ripped it right off . With any luck , Sadie would be in international waters before the police boat could get under way . " Hey , " said Mabiba . " How 'd you like the work I did on that head pump ? Passed that sack slicker'n - well , near as slick as shit , anyways . " Half an hour later , they had reached the twelve-mile limit . That limit was measured from the old coastline , by international law . You see , all those countries that had lost territory still claimed it , just like the state of Florida , and kept up the pretense that it was really dry land . But when Zulaika and Mabiba half a dozen small boats . Each one had a crew of two , and Zulaika knew they were well-armed , because the boats were flying the Bahamian flag . They were pirates . The Bahamas was a country made entirely of little islands off the Florida coast . Nothing was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally it still had boundaries and a jurisdiction . And it still had inhabitants , and a government . They lived on board mother ships - huge vessels permanently moored where the islands used to be . Each mother ship had hundreds of small boats , which it would send out to rob , and steal , and harass shipping . I do n't know whether the Bahamian pirates were in league with the Florida State Marine Police . Maybe they had just been listening to the police radios . But there they were , positioned outside the twelve-mile limit just as nice as GPS could position them . And while Zulaika and Mabiba were trying to calculate what to do , they heard something in the distance . When they looked through the binoculars , they saw it was the marine police . That police boat was n't going as fast as it had been , and it seemed to be slewing to port . The policemen had probably removed the port screw and shut down its engine . They would n't be able to run the starboard engine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than Sadie . Mabiba let out a Mayday on the radio , mentioning the pirates but not the police , who might have been even more dangerous . Zulaika pushed Sadie a little harder , heading straight north , away from the police , trying to turn it into a stern chase . " Jesus , babe , " said Mabiba . " We ca n't make it to Georgia before they catch us . No way . " " Got to try , " said Zulaika . " We ca n't just give up . Not while we have fuel . " " What about the pirates ? Maybe we 'd be better off .... " " Do n't you believe it , girl . They 'll kill us first and ask questions later . That 's if we 're lucky . " " You think those police wo n't do it and blame it on the pirates ? I saw that man - he had murder in his eye . Or rape . " " Well , then , we just have to try for Georgia , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep sending those Maydays . Maybe we 'll attract something else . Even another police boat would be good . They would n't dare harm us if someone could see . " " I do n't know , " said Mabiba . " Those Florida state police can be mean . " So the chase went on . Bit by bit the police boat approached Sadie . Pretty soon they were close enough to hear the bull horn . And what they heard encouraged them to go a little faster . If only they could . The pirates , in their fast outboards , kept alongside easily , always staying just outside the twelve-mile limit . One of the pirates , a tall muscular woman , picked up her own bull horn . " Come out hyah , " she shouted with a heavy accent . " De po-lice no follow . You be safe wid us . " She laughed cruelly . " What are they afraid of ? " asked Mabiba . " Why do n't they just come in and get us ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But maybe - just maybe - it 's that . " Over the northern horizon came a vessel . Big , fast , it was n't a freighter - it looked like a warship . It was grayish , but might have been white once , with a big red or orange stripe on the hull . An unfamiliar flag flew from its flagstaff . " This is the United States Coast Guard , " said a booming voice . " Stand down and prepare for boarding . " The pirates turned and fled at full speed . Zulaika pulled back on the throttle and Sadie slowly came to a stop . The Florida police boat limped up . " Those are our pris'ners , " said the boss cop . " Thanks for stopping them . We 'll take them now . " " I guess not , " came the voice from the Coast Guard cutter . " These are Federal waters . You get back inside the three-mile limit where you belong . " " Fuck , no , " said the cop . " You Fed'rals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took all that shit away from you fifty years ago . States " rights , asshole . " " We still have power in Federal waters , " said the cutter . " This is our prize . You contest it and we 'll sink your cracker ass . " " Like hell . Did n't you never hear of hot pursuit ? I 'll just radio back to New Jax and we 'll see how that shitty old tub of yours holds up against the Florida militia . " The Federals and police seemed to be distracted . Quietly , Zulaika pushed down a little on Sadie 's throttle . There was a crack and a bullet whistled past her ear . She looked up at the cutter . On its deck , three sailors were aiming rifles at her . She shut off the engine , raised her hands slowly , and sat down . So did Mabiba . The argument between the Federals and the police got louder and louder , until the Federals fired a shot from their deck gun across the police boat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida . The Coast Guard cutter fired a line from a little cannon-like thing . It fell across Sadie 's bow and Zulaika made it fast to the mooring cleat . And the next thing they knew , Sadie was boarded by Coast Guard sailors and the women were taken prisoner . The sailors took them on board the cutter and brought them before an officer . The officer was fortyish , but he had n't worn well . Looked kind of grizzled . And he had an odd smile . Kind of like a shark with his mouth closed . " What 's the problem , Commander ? " asked Zulaika . " Lieutenant , " said the officer , pointing at his insignia . ( Actually , Zulaika had known that . ) " Lieutenant Lusinski . And there 's really no problem . We can let you go immediately , as soon as we make sure you are n't wanted by the Federal authorities and have paid your income tax . " " Income tax ? What the hell is income tax ? " said Mabiba . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said the lieutenant . " I know about income tax , " said Zulaika . " It 's voluntary . We do n't have to pay . " " Not quite true , " said the lieutenant . " The tax is not voluntary , the assessment procedure is . That means you 're supposed to report how much tax you owe , and pay it . We should n't have to calculate it , and collect it from you , but we can . " " You ca n't enforce that , " said Zulaika . " The Florida cop was right - you have no police power . " " Again , not quite true . The Act of 2031 did take away our police power , it 's true - in the jurisdictions of the States . But there are still two places where we can enforce Federal law : Washington , D.C. - " " Under water , " interjected Mabiba . " Not quite . Not at low tide . Anyway , the second place is .... " He sort of smiled , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Zulaika . " Federal waters . " " Give that lady a cigar , " said the lieutenant . " You owe income tax , and here on this vessel we can collect it . In fact , we carry a U.S. magistrate just for the purpose of levying tax judgments . " He pointed to a brass plaque on the bulkhead : Lt. Lusinski picked up a little wooden mallet and struck it on his desk . " The United States Tax Court is now in session , George H. Lusinski , presiding . Docket item seventy-eight dash , er , one . Yes . You are the first this year . To make it easier , I will consolidate your cases . Do you wish the assistance of counsel ? " " Counsel ? " said Zulaika . " Due Process , " said the lieutenant . " The United States Constitution endows us with certain inalienable rights , in particular the right to Due Process . " " I guess so , " said Zulaika . " Very well . Lieutenant Turteltaub , please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if by magic . " Lieutenant J.G. Harold Turteltaub , U.S. Coast Guard , at your service , " he said . Lt. Lusinski said , " This court will recess for - oh , let 's say twenty minutes . Use my desk , Harry , I 'm going to the crapper . " He walked out the door and the tall Lt. Turteltaub somehow folded himself to fit behind the desk . " God damn , " said Mabiba . " You caught us just like a fish . You catch many fish like us ? " " We do some . " " What happens now ? " asked Zulaika . " Well , you could still estimate your own taxes . " Lt. Turteltaub showed her a form . It said : 1 . How much money did you make last year ? . 2 . How much money do you have left ? . 3 . Your tax : please send us the amount on line 2 . Mabiba and Zulaika stared at the form , open-mouthed . Finally Lt. Turteltaub began to laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zulaika let out her breath . Mabiba looked like she was going to start cussing again , but Zulaika glared at her and she said nothing . " . . . It 's really much more complicated . " Lt. Turteltaub showed them a long form with many pages . It looked like it had been written on and erased a few times . One page was nearly torn in half . " Of course , this is just for show . We do it all on computer now . " He opened a desk drawer and pulled out an old laptop computer . Mabiba laughed . " What a museum piece . " Lt. Turteltaub nodded seriously . " The Smithsonian does have its uses . " They began to fill out the forms . It took longer than twenty minutes , and there was a lot of mumbo-jumbo about " non-cash economy " and " Florida fiscal dollars " which Zulaika did n't understand at all , and what 's more , she doubted that Lt. Turteltaub did either . Finally they were finished . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turteltaub . " We 'll round off the pennies in your favor . " " Hmmm . That 's not too bad , " said Zulaika . " We do n't have that kind of cash , but there must be something on board the boat . Would you like to buy some fresh crabs ? Guaranteed non-toxic . " " Uh , I think I should warn you ... , " said Lt. Turteltaub . Lt. Lusinski came back into the room . " Dammit , Harry , are n't you finished yet ? " " They have no cash , " said Lt. Turteltaub . " What 's their boat worth ? " " I figure about thirty-seven fifty , F.O.B. Washington . " " Well , damn . That wo n't keep us in diesel for a week . " " Hey , wait a minute , " said Zulaika . " What are you talking about ? That boat 's worth sixteen thousand easy ; in New Jax . Not any thirty-seven fifty . " " And we only owe forty some-odd dollars , not four thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to tell you , " said Lt. Turteltaub . " We 're talking Federal dollars here - gold dollars , by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2028 . One Federal dollar is worth about five hundred of your Florida graybacks . " " I guess your boat 's worth a little more in Washington than New Jacksonville , " said Lt. Lusinski . " Oh , " said Mabiba . " Uh ... could we declare bankruptcy ? " " Afraid not , " said Lt. Turteltaub , getting up . " Federal taxes take precedence . " Lt. Lusinski sat down behind his desk . " Well , then , " he said . " The court is prepared to begin condemnation and seizure proceedings against the property of the aforenamed .... " He peered at the laptop . " Zulaika and Mabiba , no last names ? " " That 's right , " said Lt. Turteltaub . " You read past those missing pixels pretty well . " " Wait a minute , " said Zulaika . " You said gold dollars . Can I pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , " said Mabiba . " We got to keep the boat , babe . " " Gold ? You must be kidding , " said Lt. Turteltaub . " Well , I guess you can ; the statutory exchange rate is ten dollars a fine ounce . " " Act of 2028 , " said Lt. Lusinski solemnly . Zulaika had been clutching the little sack ever since retrieving it from beneath the boat . She opened its drawstring and upended it . Five Krugerrands fell onto Lt. Lusinski 's desk . " I think we got some change coming , " she said . Well , change turned out to be a different matter . Those Federals could n't have come up with change to save their butts , and Zulaika knew it . She watched them squirm while they invented interest and penalty charges they had somehow forgotten , and even then they could n't quite get to fifty dollars . Zulaika had a big smile on her face . " Tell you what . You fill us up with fuel and give us some supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mabiba . " Guess we must be the fish that got away . Going to have to catch yourself some other fish . " Lt. Lusinski 's expression got kind of hard . " Well , I guess so , " he said . " Tell you what , you get in your boat , we 'll fuel you up . I 've got to get on the radio . " Zulaika and Mabiba got into Sadie and prepared to get going . Seemed like it took those Federals an awful long time to get the fuel and supplies loaded . But finally the sailors got back on board the cutter , and Lt. Lusinski looked down from the cutter 's deck and told the women , " You 're free to go . " Zulaika fired up the engine and Mabiba began to cast off the bow and stern lines , when what should come chugging up but a big Florida State Marine Police patrol boat . Zulaika looked up at Lt. Lusinski . The Coast Guard officer looked back down at her . He had his shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies . We have to be on our way . " " Wait a minute , " said Zulaika . " You ca n't leave us here like this . " " Sure I can , " said Lt. Lusinski . " Can and will . Just as soon as I give Mr. Marine Police over there one of these gold coins for evidence . " I guess you recollect they called treasure divers " looters " in Florida , and Zulaika and Mabiba both knew what they did to looters . It was kind of cruel , but not unusual . Not in Florida . " Do n't do this ! " shouted Zulaika . " Have mercy . Those men have it in for us . We might not survive . And we 're U.S. taxpayers . " " Well , " said the lieutenant , still grinning and showing his teeth , " I guess we could transport you to Washington . " " Georgia would be fine , " said Mabiba . " ' Fraid we ca n't put ashore in Georgia . They do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really put ashore anywhere up this whole coast . Except Washington , of course . " " You do n't have to put us ashore , " said Zulaika . " Just let us off in our boat . " " Well , " said the lieutenant in a real soft voice , " I guess you did n't know about the transportation fee . Unless you got a lot more gold , I do n't suspect you 're going to have that boat much longer . " Lieutenant Turteltaub explained it all while they were on their way to Washington . There was this Federal act , left over from the last century - had n't passed much laws the last fifty years , did n't really need to , probably could n't find a quorum in Congress if they tried . Anyhow , this law said any civilian using military transportation had to reimburse the Government for the cost . And it took a hellacious number of dollars to run that cutter . But they settled on thirty-seven fifty and called it square . Well , Zulaika and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite under water . Not at low tide . They had no boat , no fishing gear , no crab traps , and no home back in Florida to go to . Not when the police wanted them as looters . Zulaika just stood there on the mud flats and began to cry . " Dammit , Mabiba , I really screwed up . I always tried to be the smart one , make plans , always know what I was doing . And I just got outsmarted . " " It 's okay , babe , " Mabiba said . " It is n't okay . It 's my fault . They were going to take Sadie anyway . I could n't save her , and I lost our gold too . Got proud , tried to out-sharp that Goddamn sharp lieutenant . " " I guess he 's been doing this a long time , " said Mabiba . " Is n't your fault . " But Zulaika just cried harder and harder . " Look here , Miz Zulaika , " said Mabiba in her sternest voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . But you 're something better . You stuck by me when I let off my temper at that policeman , when they would have let us go . You never gave me a hard time about that . And you stuck by me again when I mouthed off to that old lieutenant . I know I pissed him off , sometimes I just do that . And maybe that 's why he decided to turn us over to the police . But you never threw it up to me , not once . You 're the loyalest friend in the world , and I love you for it . " She gave Zulaika a big hug , and then reached into the waistband of her pants and pulled out a small sack . " You know , you never once asked me if I found anything in that little safe . Look here . " And she poured about a dozen big shiny diamonds into Zulaika 's cupped hands . And we all lived happily ever after .
