Headnote From the cutting edge of science , a daily master plan guaranteed to keep you going and going and going ... WHEN is YOUR daily low point-that moment when you feel your spirits and energy flagging ? Do n't tell us , we know . We sifted through the very latest research on sleep , metabolism , stress , and chronobiology to identify the times when you are most vulnerable to fatigue-and , with expert help , devised a foolproof plan to help you combat it . These eight just-discovered strategies ensure you will wake up refreshed and recharged , remain alert throughout the day , and wind down just in time for a good night 's sleep . Power walk , anyone ? 1 BRIGHTEN YOURMORNING * OLD SCIENCE : Let your body sleep for it needs . * NEW SCIENCE : Get up at the same unie , ana Diune yourself in light . It enables your circadian rhythms , which are governed by your body 's " master clock " in the hypothalamus gland , to stay in synch with the 24-hour day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle wants to delay by an average of 12 minutes every day and work on a 24.2-hour rhythm . ( Scientists do n't understand why , but think it may relate to the sun 's seasonal shifts . ) " That means your body wants to keep pushing your bedtime to later , " says Mariana Figueiro , PhD , program director of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institutes Lighting Research Center . " But if you let that happen and still have to get up at the same time every day , you 're going to be tired . " To keep your circadian rhythms in time with the 24-hour day ( when they get out of whack , you feel like you 're jetlagged ) , head to the light as soon as you get up , even on a Saturday when you 've decided to sleep in. * Try this : You need 30 minutes of exposure to light first thing . An easy way to get it is to go for a half-hour stroll outdoors while sipping your coffee . Or have your breakfast by a sunny window . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , consider investing in a light therapy box ( $174 ; light thi'rapyproducts.coni ) with 20 times the intensity of average indoor lighting , which people use to treat seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) . No light box ? Crank up the lights-every little bit may help . 2 PUT MORE PROTEIN IN YOUR DIET * OLD SCIENCE : To sustain energy , lo , * NEW SCIENCE : Limit them . Although they can provide a burst of " quick burn " fuel , carbohydrates are an energy drain if you consume too many . Women who reduced the amount of carbohydrates in their diets and raised the amount of protein reported feeling more energetic , in recent research done by Donald K. Layman , PhD , a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois . " That 's been absolutely consistent in all our studies , " he says . * Try this : Keep your daily intake of healthy carbs below 150 g , best apportioned like this : five servings of vegetables ; two servings of fruit ; and three or four servings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , rice , pasta , or cereal . You might , for instance , start your day with a breakfast of one slice of bread or one-half of an English muffin , one egg , a slice each of ham and cheese , and a glass of milk . Lunch could be an openfaced sandwich of one slice of bread , 2 to 3 ounces of meat , and 1 ounce of cheese ; two servings of vegetables ; and an apple . Dinner should consist of 6 ounces of lean meat , three servings of vegetables , one serving of fruit , and one or two servings of starchy carbs. 3 POSTPONE YOUR PICK-ME-UP * OLD SCIENCE : . - TK yourself up with a midmorning coffee break . * NEW SCIENCE : Have your latte later . That 's when you 'll really need it . Caffeine keeps you operating at a high level by blocking the effects of adenosine , a sleep-inducing brain chemical that accumulates as the day wears on . By the time adenosine builds up to the point where you start feeling sleepygenerally , late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn off , says James K. Wyatt , PhD , director of the Sleep Disorders Service and Research Center at Rush University Medical Center . * Try this : You can stay alert by drinking about 2 ounces of coffee ( equal to a large shot glass ) several times throughout the day , Wyatt found in a recent study . But you do n't have to go to all that trouble . " Having to 1 cup of coffee or its caffeine equivalent during the late afternoon , when the pressure to sleep is high , will keep you energized , " he says . If you 're highly sensitive to caffeine 's effects , you should push your break back to early afternoon so you do n't have difficulty falling asleep at night , he advises . 4 ENJOY EVERY MEAL BY THE CLOCK * OLD SCIENCE : Grazing " - eating several small meals a day when you feel hungry-keeps your energy levels high . * NEW SCIENCE : Eat your meals at the same mue every day . Your body 's caloric needs are closely tied to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to bed and when you expend the most energy ( during your late-day fitness walk , for example ) . " What will make you tired is if your body expects a 7 o'clock breakfast and a 12 o'clock lunch and you skip one of those , " says Layman . " Chaotic eating leads to greater hunger and overeating . " Try this : Prepare your breakfast the night before so you 're sure to start the day with a boost even if you 're running late . Pack a lunch to take to work in case you ca n't get away from your desk midday . Make several meals on the weekend that you can quickly heat up so that you and your family eat dinner at the same time every night . That way , you 'll all have enough energy for an after-dinner badminton game . 5 MEDITATE IN SHORT BURSTS * OLD SCIENCE : Meditate for at least 20 minutes to reduce stress . * NEW SCIENCE : Get the same results wit rief session . " Even in the span of 3 minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constrict your blood vessels , " says Judith Orloff , MD , a psychiatrist at UCLA and author of Positive Energy . " It increases endorphins , too . " Quick time-outs throughout your workday are also easier to fit into a busy schedule than a longer one at the end . * Try this : Find a quiet place where you wo n't be interrupted . ( " In a busy office , that may even mean going into the bathroom , " says Orloff . ) Sit down and close your eyes . Listen to your breath as you slowly inhale and exhale , and when thoughts intrude , imagine that they 're like clouds floating by in the sky . Then visualize something or someone who makes you happy . It could be someplace you 've been on vacation , someone you love , or something you love doing ( like lounging in a fragrant bath ) . 6 STEP OUTSIDE DURING LATE-DAY SLUMPS * OLD SCIENCE : Afternoon droop ? Tak nap . * NEW SCIENCE : Illuminate yourself outdoors . Just as it does in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt an afternoon energy dip , which often comes on like clockwork . " Because of the way the homeostatic and circadian systems interact , most people feel a lull 17 to 18 hours after they went to bed the previous night , " says Figueiro. * Try this : Step outside into revitalizing sunlight for a short walk . Vary your routine by taking a different path every day , doing a short errand , or catching up with a friend on your cell phone . If you ca n't get outside , plant yourself next to a window , open the shades wide , and look out . ( One day your employer may even be able to help : Philips Electronics is making a system for offices called Dynamic Lighting that alters the light level throughout the day-raising it in the afternoon , for instance , to counteract the postlunch dip that many workers experience. ) 7START YOUR WORKOUT WITHASONG * OLD SCIENCE : . : grimed for your workout with a light snack . * NEW SCIENCE : Jazz yourself up with music instead . Exercise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tired for an antifatigue workout ? Put in your earphones while you lace up your walking shoes : Music will help you forget you 're whipped . Volunteers who worked out for 30 minutes while listening to tunes felt they were n't exerting themselves as much as when they exercised without music , Japanese researchers reported recently in the Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness . * Try this : Load your iPod or mix CD with your favorite up-tempo tunes . If you 're the literary type , an audiobook can also help distract you from feelings of fatigue . 8 TURN DOWN THE RIGHT LIGHTS * OLD SCIENCE : lewmg V betoreyou gc a you awake . * NEW SCIENCE : , Vatching TV is okay , but looking at your computer is not . " Studies show that very bright lightthe equivalent to outdoor early morning light-will increase brain activity , " says Figueiro . " Our work has shown that you can increase alertness with far less . " Some scientists believe that the light emitted by a computer monitor late at night can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with the stimulation of an engaging video game . Wind down by watching television instead . Most people sit far enough away from a TV set ( at least 15 feet ) to be unaffected by its brightness . Better yet , read a book or magazine . Just make sure the light you use does n't exceed 60 watts . * Try this : Log off at least an hour before you go to bed . <p>
