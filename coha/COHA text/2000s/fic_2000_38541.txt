Since we last heard from him back in October , Mr. Goulart has busily been working on such projects as a forthcoming collection of detective yarns entitled Adam and Eve on a Raft , a new Groucho Marx mystery , and a big illustrated book entitled Comic Book Culture ( a companion to Frank Robinson 's Pulp Culture ) . Here he offers usa textbook example of how to get ahead in advertising . Who writes these textbooks anyway ? <p> THE FIELD REPRESENTATIVE of the demon showed up exactly thirty days before Pete Whitlock 's fifty-fifth birthday . He assumed human form for the visit , appearing as a handsome , tanned young man in his late twenties . " How you doing , Pete ? " he inquired just after materializing in the doorway of Pete 's den at a few minutes after two on an overcast afternoon in late October . Pete had been hunched at his computer keyboard , trying to beef up his resume . " I 've decided not to sell , " he told the young man , looking up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still has the house listed , you can just - " " Name 's Chip Willis . " The demon 's rep held out a completely believable hand . " I 'm not in real estate . " Getting up , Pete shook hands . " From the bank ? They mentioned they were going to send somebody over about the equity loan , " he said . " See , I 've decided to keep the house for a while , borrow on it and hold on until I get the new advertising job I 'm waiting for . " " Good plan , Pete . " Willis settled into the big brown armchair . " Wo n't make much difference in the long haul , but you may as well go out hopefully . " Frowning , Pete asked , " You are n't from the bank ? " " hope , but it 's a natural mistake . " Willis smiled broadly . " I 've got myself rigged to suggest something like that - sincerity , financial stability . Could be a lawyer , maybe an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect and believe in . " " Who in the hell are you then ? Why did you walk right into my house ? " " Did n't walk in , sport , " corrected the smiling Willis . " I materialized . You must 've heard the faint popping sound . It 's caused by the displacement of - " " Great , wonderful . I do n't have enough problems . Now I have a lunatic prowling my - " " Keep cool , there 's no problem . I 'm not a loon , a serial killer or any other common suburban bugaboo . " " Go away , " suggested Pete . " If you 're a burglar , I have to tell you right off that - " " Not a burglar either , no . " His smile broadened . " Well , what say we get down to business ? " " What business ? I do n't , far as I know , have any impending business at all with a lunatic . " " Hey ; Pete , you 're not paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I was n't a nutcake ? Relax , listen to me now . " A briefcase appeared suddenly on his lap , a brand new one made of real black leather . " Sorry , I forgot this . " Pete dropped down into his desk chair , turning to face Willis . " How 'd you do that ? " " Impressive , huh ? It 's black magic . " He unfastened the black case , reached inside . " But you ought to know all about that . " " All about black magic ? Listen , Mr. Willis , I think maybe you - " " Call me Chip . " " Chip , I 'm commencing to think that you 've got the wrong Peter Whitlock , " he told him . " Maybe , you know , you want some other Peter Whitlock . Peter J. Whitlock , say , or Peter F. Whitlock or maybe - " " No , you 're my boy , Pete . " He extracted a rolled sheet of parchment . It was tied with a faded twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " No , I ca n't say I do . What is it ? " Willis tapped his knee with the rolled parchment . " Let me refresh your memory , " he offered . " Frisco . Thirty years ago . Well , thirty years less thirty days ago actually . " " Thirty years ago I was living out in San Francisco , yeah , " he admitted , becoming aware of some twisting pains beginning deep in his stomach . " That was my first advertising job , with Arnold &; Maxwell . I started there as a copywriter just before my twenty-fifth birthday . But I do n't see what that has to do with - " " It was there you began your impressive meteoric rise to success in your chosen profession . " " Meteoric ? " Pete laughed ruefully . " I 've been out of work for nearly five months . I never rose above copywriter with any of the five agencies I 've worked with over the years . I 'm living here in New Beckford , Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $450,000 to maybe $375,000 . I 'm paying two vicious and vindictive former wives alimony and the last award I won was for some HoundDog Puppy Treat trade ads back in 1988 . " He shook his head slowly . " Success ? You 've definitely got the wrong Peter Whitlock , Chip . " " Let me clarify something , " offered Willis , a trace of impatience sounding in his voice . " Because , see , lots of people I come to collect from try similar dodges . But , the point is , success is relative and everybody ca n't become a flapping billionaire . Even the most powerful demon in the netherworld ca n't go around turning everybody into a millionaire . Hell , that 'd futz up the economy worse than it is already . " " Collect ? What did you come to collect ? " " We 'll get to that in a minute . " " And what was that reference to demons ? " " Oh , c'm on - are you pretending you never heard of Shug Nrgyzb ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Snug Nrgyzb is who I work for . " " Not a very catchy name for a company . " " Shug Nrgyzb is n't a company or a product , Pete . He 's a demon , " explained Willis , waving the parchment . " A truly powerful one . " " You 're claiming you work for a demon ? " " I do work for a demon . " " You really are a loon . You 'd just better leave my - " " Whoa , whoa . Pete , I do n't have all that much time to waste . " Untying the ribbon , he unfurled the parchment . " The bottom line here is that you made a deal with Shug Nrgyzb thirty years back and now the time has come to settle the - " " I never heard of him until just this minute , " insisted Pete as he stood up again . " It 's not the sort of name you 'd forget . And , trust me , if I 'd made any deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a half-wit notion , I would sure as hell remember it . " Willis shook his head . " Been tried , pal . " " What 's been tried ? " " Stupidity defense . ' I was too dense to know what I was doing . " Never works , not ever , " the rep assured him . " Possibly in a court of law you could pull something like that and have a chance . But , hey , none of that cuts any ice with a demon . " Pete sat .. " You 're claiming that thirty years ago out in San Francisco I made some kind of deal with this Shug Nrgyzb ? " " You are n't pronouncing Nrgyzb right , Pete . It 's Nrgyzb . " " Be that as it may , Chip - What was this deal I allegedly made ? " " In exchange for thirty years of uninterrupted success , you agree to- " " You call what I 've lived through for the past thirty years uninterrupted success ? Do you have anything in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure . " " How can any man who was married to Mary Jo for ten long , bleak years be considered a success ? " " You continue to miss the point , Pete . If you had n't , see , made the deal things would 've been even worse , " the rep told him . " Success for a schlep like you does n't involve sitting on top of the world for three decades . Nope , it means rather that you - " " And then there was Mary Jane , my second wife . " " Were you aware that you have a tendency to marry women with similar names ? " " Yeah . But tell me what could have been worse than seven years with Mary Jane ? " " Seven more with Mary Jo . It 's all , I keep trying to convince you , relative . Believe me-you 've had a much better life than you deserved . " " Do you know what my current bank balance is ? " " Checking or savings ? " " Savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're in Fairfield County . People hereabouts give 611,426 to their cleaning ladies as a Christmas bonus , they often drop $11,426 into a homeless beggar 's Styrofoam cup , they toss $11,426 to their kids for pocket money . $11,426 , believe me , is not a fortune . It sure as hell is not an impressive amount to have to show for thirty damn years of wild success . " " For a born loser like you , Pete , it 's about $10,000 more than you deserve . " He rattled the parchment , at the same time making an impatient noise . " Back to the business at hand . It 's our policy , as you know , to call on our clients thirty days in advance of the collection date . That way , Pete , you have time to put your affairs in order , maybe arrange a farewell party , do those things you 've always been meaning to do and , being such a schlep , never got around to doing . " " Wait now . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old hokey business where you come to collect my soul ? " " No , it is not , nope . " Willis grinned . " All Shug Nrgyzb wants is your life . " " Life ? " " On your fifty-fifth birthday he 'll appear and devour you . " Pete sank , slowly , back into his desk chair . " What exactly does being devoured by Shug Nrgyzb involve ? " " Painless really . Being as how he 's on the large side , he can devour the average person in two bites . Three tops , " promised Willis . " Some folks get panicky when they witness the flames and smoke that accompany a manifestation of Shug Nrgyzb , but that 's all for show . You might , possibly , experience a few first degree burns , but you 'll only be alive for a few seconds after that anyway . " " Listen , Chip , I never made any deal with this guy , " insisted Pete . " So it really does n't seem fair , particularly since I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to come and devour me . I 'm sure that if you point out the mistake to him , he 'll be only too glad to - " " Actually , Shug Nrgyzb has a reputation for being a real shit , Pete , " Willis pointed out . " He could drop by and devour you merely for the fun of it . Yet that 's a moot point , since you did actually sign this document . " He paused , scanning the parchment . " Oops . " " Ha ! It is n't me you want at all , is it ? " " Oh , it 's you sure enough . No doubt about that , Pete . " He held out the parchment . " You see , the way this works is that the party who enjoys the success is the one who has to pay the piper . In this particular instance , however , you did n't personally sign yourself up for the thirty year success package . That was - " " Jennifer Windmiller . " He 'd grabbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom . " Old girlfriend of yours , as I understand it . " " Jennifer Windmiller , " Pete repeated softly as he let the parchment drop to the carpet . " I have n't thought of her for years . " Willis rose up , smoothing his trousers . " Well , you owe all the great things that have happened to you during your adult life to that little lady , " he said , smiling . " We wo n't see each other again , but it 's been nice meeting you . Oh , and do n't try to run when Shug Nrgyzb shows up to collect . That would only make him madder and he 'd probably devour you in smaller bites . " There was a faint popping noise as Willis , his briefcase and the parchment all vanished . ZORINA TASHLIN reached across the desk to brush at his left coat sleeve . " Lint , " the thin dark woman mentioned . " Perhaps your long stretch of unemployment , Peter , is due as much to your slovenly appearance as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as a slob , " he countered . " But let 's get back to my latest problem . " She picked up her pencil , set it down an inch to the right of where it had been . " I 'm a career consultant , not a therapist . " " No , no , I 'm not cracking up , " he assured her . " It 's simply that I seem to be mixed up , through no fault of my own , with a vindictive demon . " " Perhaps if you accepted responsibility for your problems , you'd- " " The reason I came by this afternoon , Zorina , is that I need some advice about how to - " " If you honestly believe that this old sweetheart of , yours has put a curse on you , then she 's the one you must talk to . " " It 's not exactly a curse , it was supposed to be a boon . Thirty years of ongoing achievement , except it did n't turn out quite that way . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windmiller ? " " Why do n't you simply contact her , Peter ? " " I tried that , soon as the demon 's advance man vanished , " he answered . " Trouble is , she 's not listed anywhere in the San Francisco Bay Area , not according to phone information . And I used the Net every way I could think of and did n't find one damn trace of her . " " Probably she 's married . " " Maybe , more than once . I do n't have any idea , however , what her name is these days . " " Finding lost loves is not part of my service . But a good private investigator might be able to - " " That will take too long , " he cut in . " But you advise a lot of people on career changes , help them find new jobs . Do you know anybody who specializes in occult stuff ? I want to approach the problem from the demon angle , but unfortunately there 's nothing like an occult investigator listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the office window at the gray late afternoon parking lot . " Well , I suppose there is Batsford . " " What does he do ? " " Mostly Batsford fouls up the job interviews I send him out on , " she said , picking up the pencil again . " He maintains that , in addition to being a second rate accountant , he 's an investigator of the supernatural . Mind you , Peter , 1 ca n't vouch for the validity of such a claim . " " Basically I need someone who 's knowledgeable about warding off demons . Or at least stalling them for a while . " " Check with Batsford . " She wrote an address on a memo slip . " His phone 's not in service at the moment . And do n't , by the way , give him any cash in advance . He has a tendency to go off on sprees . " Taking the slip , Pete studied the address before folding it and inserting it in his shirt pocket . " Long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of a job ? " " I hesitate to send you out on any more interviews , Peter , if you plan to be eaten by a demon in a month 's time . " " If Batsford is any good at all , I 'll have longer than that . " " You 'll have to guarantee me you 're going to be alive for at least a year . " " C'm on , that 's not fair , Zorina . Nobody can guarantee you that they 'll live another year . " " That 's true , yes , but none of my other clients has a fiend from the netherworld breathing down his or her neck . " " What about that copywriting job for Help-A-Tot ? You mentioned there might be an opening there about now . " " It 's beneath you , Peter . " " Five months I 've been out of work . " " I was n't aware of the exact nature of the position when I brought it up the other day . " She tapped the eraser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collects money for underprivileged children around the world . Each child is supposed to write a letter to his or her individual sponsor every three months . Alas , Help-A-Tot is n't as aboveboard about those letters as I was originally led to believe . It turns out they 're faked , all written by the same person and then mailed by stringers across the globe . The Help-A-Tot copywriter is the person who has to crank out those fraudulent missives . It 's disgusting . " " Disgusting , " he agreed . " But what does it pay ? " She rose up , carefully , frowning . " Clean up this demon mess first , " she advised . " Then we can talk jobs again , Peter . " " That 's not a crystal ball , " observed Pete . " Yes , it is . " " Looks like a fishbowl to me . " " If it were a fishbowl , my skeptical chum , there 'd be a myriad of colorful little fish flitting around inside it , " said Batsford . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish would 've dribbled out long since . " " Who 's the occult expert , my boy - you or I ? " " Well , Zorina claims that you are , though I 'm starting to have - " " And how much am I charging you for this entire lengthy session ? " " Fifty dollars . " " That 's an incredibly low fee , my boy , considering that you 're getting my exclusive and undivided services . " He was a small , rumpled man in his middle forties , wearing a double-breasted blue suit and a white sweatshirt . The questionable crystal ball rested on a card table in the center of the small , cluttered living room of his second-floor apartment . " I 'm skeptical that any of this , " admitted Pete , who was sitting opposite the mystic , " is going to work . " " I must have silence while I 'm trying to tune in on the supernatural realms . " " Is that what you 're supposed to be doing ? What exactly will that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched at his left armpit . " I may go off into a trance any time now , " he warned . " Should I say nothing for a full five minutes , my boy , reach across and give me a hearty nudge . Trances sometimes , unfortunately , segue into naps . " He placed his stubby hands , fingers spread wide , on each side of the upended fishbowl . " Om mani padme hum . " A loud thumping sounded in the dimlit room . " Is that , " inquired Pete , " something mystical ? " " Merely the young marrieds upstairs wrestling with each other . Ignore it . " Batsford shut his eyes . " Om mani padme hum . " The crystal ball began to glow with a pale yellow light . A tiny figure appeared within it . Leaning forward , squinting at the image , Pete exclaimed , " Hey , that 's Jenny Windmiller . Except she looks exactly as she did when I was dating her out in San Francisco thirty some years ago . I remember those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine tuning that has to be done , " said Batsford in a gruffer voice . " Let 's fast forward to the present . " Jennifer went through a series of changes , her slim figure growing gradually plumper and her dark hair undergoing various style changes and ending up short-cropped and gray . Her clothes changed , too , and finally she appeared within the globe clad in a full-length fur coat . " That ca n't be her . " " Time has a tendency to blur the - " " No , I mean she 's a vegetarian . A fur coat - looks like mink , does n't it ? - is something Jenny 'd never put on . " " Ah - ah . " Batsford suddenly slumped in his folding chair . His voice shifted again and he began talking in a piping falsetto . " Her name now is Jennifer Sanson . She resides in Santa Morgana , California . " " That 's over in Marin County , across the Bay from San Francisco . " He leaned closer to the crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number ? " " Look it up in the directory , schmuck , " the piping voice advised him . " It 's possible she can re-negotiate the contract with Shug Nrgyzb , although she has n't practiced any black magic for many a ... " Sighing , Batsford came toppling forward . His head whacked the fish bowl , sending it hopping off the table . Pete lunged , caught it before it smacked the bare hardwood . It felt extremely hot in his hands . " Nice catch . " Batsford had his own voice once more . He was sitting up , rubbing at his eyes . " Did we find out anything ? " " Do n't you know ? " He shook his shaggy head . " I was in a trance during the best parts . Did we ? " " According to you , Jennifer is now - " " Not according to me , my boy . According , rather , to one of my valuable controls . Was it a kindly Southern gent who - " " Sounded more like Mickey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sweet child , though a mite salty . " " Is she reliable ? " " Almost always , yes . " " Well , she claims Jenny is now a Mrs. Sanson and residing in Northern California . " " You can put your faith in Little Eva , bless her . " " Okay , I 'll check with information and get Jennifer 's phone number , " said Pete , getting up . " I 'll phone her and tell her to do something to call off Shug Nrgyzb . " " You must go out there in person . " Standing , Batsford scratched at his backside . " What do you mean ? " " Eh ? " " You told me I have to go out there to California . " When Batsford frowned , new wrinkles joined those already crowding together on his pale forehead . " What sort of voice did I use ? " " Sounded like your own . " " Ah , that must be Mr. Dennison . I 'm told he sounds a great deal like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly . " I 'd heed Dennison were I you . He has an impressive track record in this sort of thing . " " Look , if Jennifer is still capable of calling off this demon , she does n't need me out there . With my finances the way they are , a trip West would be- " " It 's essential that you confront her face to face , " cried Batsford in Little Eva 's voice . " And , please , take nice Mr. Batsford along for occult protection . " He blinked , shook his head . " Who spoke to you this time ? " Pete eyed him . " Have you been wishing for a vacation out in California ? " " No , absolutely not . I loathe the place . Far too much sunshine and the whole state is due to fall into the sea any day now . Hate California , my boy . " Pete shook his head . " Never mind , thanks for your help . " He moved toward the door . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warm water had smacked him on the head . He glanced upwards . " Couple upstairs ? " " After they grapple , they take a shower together . " He shuffled across the room to open the door . " Let me know when we 're leaving for the Coast . " Three nights later Pete was getting wet on a rainswept hillside in Santa Morgana , California . Far below , beyond the houses and the wooded acres , the San Francisco Bay showed blurred and black . The lights of the restaurants and the docked boats of this little bayside town glowed fuzzily . Pete was standing beside their rented car , shining a flashlight at the silent engine . " Why am I doing this ? " he asked . " I do n't know a damn thing about automobiles . " " Does n't look too complicated , my boy , " observed Batsford , who was hunched next to him and using a steepled copy of the San Francisco Chronicle as a rain shield . " And you-what kind of mystic are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in communication with have foreseen this ? " " Spirits , " corrected the occult consultant . " I get most of my psychic help from the ghosts of the departed who - nertz to you , kiddo . " The last phrase came out in a falsetto . " Now , now , Little Eva . " " Why in the hell did n't somebody like Little Eva predict that this car we rented was going to break down ? " " I did mention at the time , " reminded Batsford , " that a firm calling itself the Rockbottom Cheap Car Rental Agency might not deal in the most reliable of vehicles . " " We 're on a very tight budget , " Pete told him as he probed with the beam of the flash . " Having to pay your way out here means I ca n't go first cabin on everything . Is that red wire supposed to be dangling there ? " " That looks more like a strand of spaghetti . Perhaps the last mechanic to service this rattletrap was snacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is jinxed , " lamented Pete . " If only I 'd been able to talk to Jennifer on the phone I could 've avoided this entire trip - and the cost . " " It occurs to me that her husband 's refusal to allow you telephone access to the lady is highly suspicious . " " He said she was down with the flu . Not a very cordial guy from the sound of him . " " Contractors are usually aggressive burly types . Besides , you called the house something like a dozen times demanding to speak to her . " " Listen , Batsford , I 'm going to be devoured by this demon in twentyseven days . That would make anybody anxious and uneasy . " " Whap the carburetor , " advised the mystic in a vaguely Germanic voice . " We 'll fix der dodgosted thing dot way . " " Hum ? " Batsford blinked . " Did I speak ? " " You told me to hit the carburetor - in a lousy Dutch accent . " " Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to pretend he 's a Nordic type , " explained Batsford as the rain pelted down on his newspaper . " During his lifetime , he worked in a garage in Minneapolis . It would n't hurt to heed his advice . " Sighing , Pete leaned further under the raised hood and fisted something he was nearly certain was the carburetor . The engine returned to life . Pete waited for a few seconds , grinned , shut the hood and jumped back in the driver 's seat . " C'm on , let 's go . " WHEN PETE stepped into the second-floor bedroom off the rainswept balcony , Jennifer said , " You 're getting mud all over the carpet , Peter . " " Same old Jenny , " he said . " You husband 's locked you in here and I , after coming westward from distant Connecticut at considerable expense , have just climbed up a very rickety drain pipe to rescue you and all you can say by way of greeting is - " " Is Connecticut where you live now ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She looked even plumper than she had in the mystic 's low-grade crystal ball . Wearing a loose flowered dress , she was sitting on the edge of a large spool bed . " You would n't happen to have anything like a fig newton or a granola bar with you , I suppose ? " " No , nope . " " Oliver - that 's Oliver Sanson , my present husband - has been keeping me on a terribly skimpy diet , " she explained . " How , by the way , did you know I was locked up here in my bedroom ? " He moved nearer the bed . " Little Eva . " " That 's your wife , is it ? " " No , she 's one of Batsford 's contacts in the spirit world and she - " " Oh , you 're not messing with mediums and sorcerers , are you ? " She shook her head . " That 's a terrible hobby . I would n't have anything to do with that sort of - " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild youth , jenny - when you made your damned deal with Shug Nrgyzb . " " That 's pronounced Nrgyzb , " she corrected . " And , listen , Peter , I really do feel awfully bad about that . In fact , that 's why I 'm a sort of prisoner in my own home right now . " She glanced down at his wet trousers and noticed that the knee was torn out of one leg . " I bet Rollo took a nip at you . Or was it Bosko ? " " The bigger of the two police dogs-he did n't introduce himself . " He rubbed at his knee . " Batsford had both those beasts hypnotized and then Little Eva took over to tell us your husband was out and that you were locked up here . " " Yes , tonight 's Oliver 's poker night . " Dropping into a fat pink armchair facing the big bed , he said , " Get back to how my impending role as snack food for a demon from the netherworld inspired your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything of a sweet nature with you ? Something with a peanut butter center would be especially welcome about - " " In a little over three weeks , Jenny , Shug Nrgyzb is going to pop up amidst , as it 's been explained to me , considerable fire and brimstone and snarf me down . So let 's forget about other sorts of eating experiences for now . " " I 'm truly sorry about this , " the plump gray-haired woman assured him . " At the time I only thought how nice it would be if you had a rich , happy life . " " Rich , happy and short . " " Thirty years , my gosh , it seemed like a heck of a long time back then , Peter , " she said . " And you have had a pretty happy and successful life , have n't you ? I was disappointed that I 've never seen anything about you in Time or Fame or even the National Intruder , but I told myself yours was probably a quieter sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go into that later , " he said , impatient . " Tell me how your husband fits into my problem . " " Well , I could n't exactly remember when your birthday was , " she said . " We lost touch an awfully long time ago . But , I do n't know , I started to get the feeling that it was getting close and that thirty years had gone by . I had n't told you what I 'd done then because I thought we 'd be together forever and ever and I wanted it to be a surprise . " She sighed , looking up at the pink ceiling . " It occurred to me the other day that I should find out where you were and give you a ring . " " ' Hello , Pete , a big green monster 's going to gobble you up on your birthday . Bye . " " " Anyway , Peter , I decided to talk the situation over with Oliver . " " Does n't the guy know about your dabbling in black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I gave all that up years and years ago . Right after I quit smoking pot and a couple husbands before this one . " She shook her head . " Oliver is a very successful contractor here in Northern California . Well , he 's about $900,000 in the hole right now , but that 's not too bad . He 's going to hid on building the new Marin County ArtPlex . That 's that mall sort of thing where they 'll have an opera house and a ballet stage and a theater-in-the-round and all sons of gourmet restaurants and exotic souvenir shops and - " " Why 'd he lock you up ? " " Because I would n't go along with what he wanted , " she replied . " He was n't at all interested in your impending doom , Peter , but he was most anxious that I summon up this demon for him . " " He wanted to make a deal with Shug Nrgyzb to make sure he got the contract to build this thing ? " She nodded , sniffling some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " He hopes to get inside information on the bids and try to guarantee that he 'll be the one chosen to build the ArtPlex . " " You refused . " She shuddered , hugging herself . " I told him it was much too dangerous , " she said . " I simply do n't want to mess with black magic ever again . " He left the chair and stood over her . " But you could summon up this demon ? " " I suppose , " she said slowly , not looking at him . " I 'd have to dig up my old magic books and - " " Where are the books , Jenny ? " " That 's exactly what Oliver wants to know . " Sighing , she shuddered again . " He says he 's going to keep me locked away until I give in , go get the books and arrange an interview with the demon . " " Are the books hidden here somewhere ? " " Course not . I 'm pretty certain they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He frowned , thoughtful . " I remember her .

" " Poor Aunty Bunny 's been dead nearly five years and the house 's been locked up for the past two or three . " " You can get in ? " " I have a key , sure , " she admitted . " But , really , I think it 's too risky to try summoning up Shug Nrgyzb . " " Maybe , but we have to talk to him , " he told her evenly . " You 're going to convince him that I 'm a dupe in this whole mess . And we 'll persuade him to cancel the deal . " " He 's not a very amiable demon . " " So I 've been told . But we have to try to get him to be reasonable . " He took hold of one of her plump arms and lifted her to her feet : " C'm on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she said , " Okay , all right . I 'll make a try at it . " BATSFORD SNEEZED . " The dust lies thick upon these ancient tomes , " he remarked and sneezed again . The three of them were up in the dim-lit attic of the three-story Victorian house high in the hills of Berkeley . Thunder was rumbling outside and a chill night wind was rattling the shutters and trim that the old place was thick with . Jennifer , squatting beside an open steamer trunk , was leafing through a thick volume bound in yellowish leather . With her other hand she was eating fig newtons from the big box they 'd stopped to buy at a 24-hour supermarket en route . " Could you , Jenny , maybe refrain from snacking and concentrate on this spell ? " mentioned Pete . " Relax , I 've just now found it . " After wiping crumbs off her chin , she pointed to a foxed page midway through the hefty volume . Batsford tilted his head so he could read the title on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Monstrodamus . " He nodded , frowning . " A notorious sorcerer in his day . " " And he wrote up some terrific spells . " Jennifer placed the open book on the dusty attic floor . " We might as well do the whole business right here . No use messing up any of the rooms . " " How mess up ? " asked Pete . " When a fiery demon shows up , there 's often smoke damage , " she said . " Right now , I need some magic chalk . " " Here you go , dear lady . " From a rumpled pocket in his rumpled jacket , Batsford produced a stub of bright yellow chalk and presented it to Jennifer . " Thanks . Now , you guys , push enough boxes aside so that I can have a clear space about six feet across . " Pete was leaning against a stack of large cardboard boxes . He straightened up and started hefting them out of the way . Lightning crackled outside and the single window in the slantceilinged attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate another fig newton . When sufficient space was available , she drew , on her hands and knees , a large pentagram on the raw wood flooring . " Little lopsided , " observed Batsford , who was sitting in an old bentwood rocker against a wall . " It 'll do . " Jennifer stood up , panting some . She bent and gathered up the book of Count Monstrodamus 's spells . " Maybe you better hunker down behind something at first , Peter . If he sees you right off - well , he may just devour you and the heck with waiting until your birthday . " " That would be violating the halfwit agreement . " " Even so . " Pete moved behind a stack of old suitcases , a spot from which he could n't even see the pentagram . He could hear Jennifer commence to read aloud from the magic book . It sounded as though it was in what he imagined was Middle English , interspersed with phrases in French . She droned on for about three minutes and then sneezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risked a look . Jennifer was squatting on the floor , picking up the fallen magic book . " Was that part of the ritual - the sneezing ? " he inquired . " No , it 's all the damn dust up here . Now go hide again . " He complied . " Rats , " muttered Jennifer . " I lost my place . Jeez , I guess I better start over again . " Pete emerged again . " Wo n't that screw things up ? " " Hush , quit heckling . " " Ca n't you just pick up where you left off ? That would probably be less risky and involve less chance of - " " Possibly , but I do n't remember where I left off . It 's safer , when summoning up fiends from the nether regions , to get in every word of the spell . " " Okay , you 're the expert . " He hunkered down out of sight once more . " I have n't done any of this stuff for years , remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she suggested . " You were n't such a fussbudget when we were romantically involved . " " I was n't on any demon 's menu back then . " " Kids , quit this squabbling , " put in Batsford . " Let 's get on with the ritual . " Pete sighed , shrugged , and hunched down further . When jennifer sneezed again , Pete did n't peek again or say anything . She got through the entire spell on the second try , stumbling on just one phrase - which might 've been in Ancient Persian - and only sneezing twice . Gradually all outside sounds started to fade and an immense silence filled the attic . Then Pete became aware of an odd humming noise . It sounded like dozens of people having a violent argument , only very far away . The room was growing increasingly hot , too . " Well , rash mortal - now what ? " The voice sounded like the sort of voice a cement mixer would have if it developed the ability to speak . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very slowly , and carefully , Pete started inching his head toward the edge of the barrier of suitcases . Thick yellow smoke was billowing all around . " I have summoned you , " began Jennifer in a pale , nervous voice , " I have summoned you , O Mighty Shug Nrgyzh , so that I might humbly - " " I 'm usually addressed , " the demon informed her , " as O Mighty Exalted and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb . And you 're mispronouncing Nrgyzb . " " I 'm frightfully sorry and I offer an abject apology , O Mighty Exalted and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb , " she said , voice shaky . " I do n't know if you remember me , but - " " You are Jennifer Windmiller . I never forget someone with whom I have made a binding and unbreakable contract . " Pete risked a look from behind the suitcases . The demon was quite tall and his head , or what passed for his head , was up near the beamed attic ceiling . He was a muddy shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that looked like mildew all over his huge body . Although it did n't seem likely you could pick up mildew in a place that was as hot as the netherworld was rumored to be . Yellow smoke was fuming out of his mouth and nose and what might be his ears . " It 's about that very contract , " said Jennifer , " that I want to have a chat . " She shut the book but kept her plump finger in it as a bookmark . " You see , O Mighty and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb , I - " " You left out Exalted . Things like that really annoy me , " rumbled the green demon . " Right . Well , the point is it was I who made the deal with you and not the person who reaped the benefits . So it is n't exactly fair to make him now pay for - " " Do n't I know that ? You were merely the novice sorcerer who did the negotiating , " said the demon . " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete swallowed twice before stepping out from behind the stack of suitcases . " Hi , " he said as he came into the open . " I sure hope we can work this out . " " We have a saying in the netherworld , " Shug Nrgyzb told him . " A deal is a deal . " " Just a moment , " put in Batsford . The demon did n't bother to look back at the rocking chair that the mystic was sitting in . " Do n't intrude , " he advised . Pete said , " What we 're trying to get across to you , sir , is that I never personally had anything to do with - " " What did I tell you people to call me ? " " O Mighty Exalted and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb , " said Pete . " Okay , let 's get back to my - " " So you ca n't summon up a flapping demon to save your own husband from going down the toilet . No , but for this simp you whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large tan man in a conservative gray business suit had come running up the stairs to the attic and he charged through the doorway now . " Oliver , how 'd you know I was at Aunty Bunny 's ? " " As fate would have it , Jen , I was driving home from my card gamewhere I lost a flapping $1200 - just as you and these two schmucks were racing away , " said Oliver Sanson . " Assuming you were up to no good , I followed . " " Cease , " boomed the demon , producing an extra volume of smoke . " Who is this vile intruder ? " " Vile intruder my ass . " Oliver faced him , hands on hips . " I 'll get to you in a minute . First , though , I want to get something straight with my devoted wife here . Honey , you - " " No one , " roared the demon , " speaks disrespectfully to Shug Nrgyzb . " " Hey , hold on a minute , " said Sanson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is this the guy who can ... what 's wrong , Jen ? " She was shaking her head vigorously and pointing at the demon . Sanson started to turn around just as a large green paw scooped him up . Peter sprinted to Jennifer 's side and took hold of her head . " Time to leave . " " But he 's going to devour Oliver . " " You ca n't stop him . " " True , " she acknowledged . As they started down the wooden stairs to the landing , Pete heard a large chomping sound and then a scream . Then a piping little voice said , " Hey , you big bozo , what do you think you 're doing ? " Pete and Jennifer kept running . Returning to the red plastic seat next to Pete , Batsford said , " You really can not , my boy , get a good cup of cappuccino in an airport . " Pete was sitting with his hands resting on his knees , staring out at the gray day beyond the waiting room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . " You 're sure everything is going to work out ? " " Thanks to Little Eva , " said the mystic . " She really has a knack for negotiating with demons . " " She should n't have talked him out of devouring Jennifer 's husband . Sanson deserved to be gobbled up , the bastard . " " Think of the problems the dear lady would 've had trying to explain what had happened to him if Shug Nrgyzb had eaten up the simp in his entirety . " " I suppose . " " And her hubby 's experiences with that fire-breathing critter drove all thoughts of making any sort of deal with a demon from his pea brain for good and all . " Pete watched another plane go climbing up into the sky . " But listen , if Little Eva 's so terrific at networking with demons , how come she did n't get him to cancel our deal ? " Batsford took a sip from his paper cup . " I think we made a pretty good deal , all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the early hours of your birthday this year , he graciously extended your contract for another thirty years . " " That 's going to be great when he shows up at the old folks home to collect . " " Look on the bright side , " advised Batsford after another sip . " You also get thirty more years of fabulous success . " Pete sighed . " Yeah , I 'm really looking forward to that , " he said .
