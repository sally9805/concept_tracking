Headnote Our flawed federal agricultural policies are long overdue for a major overhaul . Like a barnyard sow basking in the glow of attention at a county fair , the U.S. farm bill-that monstrously complex , multi-billion dollar , five-year plan for federal agriculture policy-has suddenly gained a high profile . Most U.S. citizens are far removed from die land that sustains us ( less than 2 percent of the population currendy farms ) , but whether you know where your food comes from or not , this bill-set to be signed into law by Sept. 30 , 2007-has a huge impact on your life . It affects not just the quality and cost of our food , but also the quality of our land , water and even our air . Food production is such an important activity , so critical to life and health , that we as a society would be wise to support farming on some level . The questions then become : Does current farm policy work to bolster farm health and enhance food security ? Does it promote a food supply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all who consume it ? Does it work to provide all our citizens with a steady , nutritious diet ? If not , what would a farm policy that did look like ? THE EVOLUTION OF FARM POLICY No one can accuse the United States of failing to commit significant resources to agriculture . Between 1995 and 2005 , U.S. taxpayers paid farmers almost $165 billion in direct payments , according to the Environmental Working Group ( www.ewg.org ) . That averages to approximately $16 billion per year-the majority of which went to the biggest growers of major crops , such as corn , wheat , cotton , soybeans and rice . The group estimates that in 2002 alone , taxpayers paid more than $12 billion to about 35 percent of America 's farms-this was an average of more than $17,000 per farm . Given that level of commitment , it 's worth asking what taxpayers are gainine in return . A well-funded but sound national farm policy should be expected to promote an economically vibrant farm sector that produces a bounty of nutritious food , while carefully managing natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy fails on all of those fronts . Indeed , existing farm policy , as embedded in the current farm bill , actively works against those goals . For example , nearly a third ( $51.3 billion ) of total farm payments from 1995 to 2005 went to corn growers . As grown by U.S. farmers , corn seems an unlikely candidate for massive public support . It causes significant environmental damage in the growing phase , and more than half of U.S. corn production is used as feed for concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) -a " factory farming " system whose environmental and social depredations are breathtaking . Now that discussion is underway on the 2007 farm bill , a hard look at how our subsidy system evolved is in order . By tracing the roots of current dysfunction , we can perhaps find a way toward a farm policy that serves the public interest . A ( NEW ) DEAL GONE SOUR A common problem faced by farmers is the tendency of prices for their goods to fall over time . U.S. farmers have often churned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to ever-lower prices . According to classical economics , farmers should respond to the " signal " of lower prices by cutting production , which would cause prices to stabilize . Instead , they 've tended to respond by scaling up-investing in land and technology to boost production dramatically . They hoped to make up in volume what they were losing in price-creating a vicious circle of rising productivity , lower prices and recurring farm crises . That situation came to a head during the Great Depression , when an extended bout of overproduction led to falling prices and a severe farm crisis . While millions of Americans went hungry due to lack of funds , farmers were stuck with huge food surpluses . Overall farm income fell by half during the early years of the Depression , and thousands of farmers defaulted on loans . In response , the Roosevelt administration made farm support a linchpin of the New Deal . To keep prices reasonable , the government tried to manage farm output . The program worked like this : When farmers began to produce too much and prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land fallow , with the goal of pushing prices up the following season . There was an additional New Deal mechanism that sought to stabilize prices : In bumper-crop years , rather than allowing the market to be flooded with grain , the government would buy excess grain from farmers and store it . In lean years-say , when drought struck-the government would release some of that stored grain , mitigating sudden price hikes . The overall goal was to stop prices from falling too low ( hurting farmers ) or jumping too high ( squeezing consumers ) . Now , you do n't have to be a free-market zealot to identify some problems with this setup . First of all , it concentrated a tremendous amount of authority within the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , whose director came to occupy a kind of " Agriculture Czar " position , wielding power over food production roughly equal to that of the Federal Reserve chair s sway over interest rates . But there was a deeper problem : The technological revolution in farming that blossomed in the second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the explosion in petroleum-powered heavy machinery , the advent of hybridized seeds-overwhelmed the government 's ability to limit supply . In short , the government could pay farmers to take acres out of production , but it could n't stop farmers from milking every last drop from each remaining acre . In 1935 , U.S. farmers devoted 100 million acres to corn , yielding 2 billion bushels . By 1975 , farmers were squeezing about 6 billion bushels out of less than 80 million acres . Given such leaps in productivity-meaning quantity , not quality-it was inevitable that the New Deal paradigm would break down . And break down it did . In the early 1970s , with grain prices low , farmers growing restive and a presidential election looming , the USDA took a new approach . Rather than focus on supply management to boost prices , the agency moved to jack up demand . This was a radical idea , because demand for food does n't tend to rise fast ; people do n't normally eat more when prices drop . EARL " RUSTY " BUTZ Since farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USDA aggressively sought overseas markets . seeking , in part , to coalesce Midwestern support for President Richard Nixon in the 1972 election , USDA secretary Earl " Rusty " Butz engineered a 30 million-ton grain sale to the Soviet Union , financed with $700 million in " export credits . " Yep : U.S. taxpayers loaned the Soviet Union money to buy our grain . As a price-boosting strategy , the Soviet grain sale was a success . Wheat and corn prices surged . But a Midwest drought the following year exerted further upward pressure on prices . Inflated grain prices rippled through the food system , driving the price of meat nearly beyond the reach of middle-class U.S. families . Along with the 1973 OPEC oil embargo , the Soviet grain sale helped spark the " stagflation " that gripped the U.S. economy into the next decade . Butz responded to the crisis he had helped set in motion by urging farmers to plant " fence row to fence row " and flood the market with the whole harvest . And if such a strategy were to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the short term , the government would support farmers with direct payments ( subsidies ) when prices dipped below the cost of production . In the long term , if U.S. consumers did n't eat their way through the surplus , new markets would be opened overseas . In the decades since , these reforms have proved a failure . The United States has worked to open markets for our goods overseas , but export growth , too , has failed to keep up with ever-rising yields . Direct subsidies ( introduced as a short-term solution , yet never replaced with a more economical alternative ) continue to promote the interests of industrial farms . Meanwhile , we 're becoming a nation of overweight citizens , thanks to the flood of cheap refined sugars and grains we 're urged to consume . ( See charts at left . ) THE 2007 PROPOSAL The agenda released by the Bush administration on Jan. 31 , 2007 seeks to carefully balance its own need to trim die federal budget and further its free-trade agenda with its desire to appease an important farm-state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the massive health , environmental and social problems haunting U.S. food production . It 's another push down the same old road . Until the recent spike in grain and oilseed prices caused by surging ethanol and biodiesel production , farmers have for years been selling commodities such as corn , soy , cotton , wheat and rice for less than the cost of production , with taxpayer subsidies paying the difference , and the biggest farms getting the majority of the subsidies , according to research by the Environmental Working Group . Owners of the largest 20 percent of farms received nearly 90 percent of the $65 billion in taxpayers ' money over the past decade . The real winners were the big grain-buying firms , which made billions by buying up cut-rate grain and turning it into dubious " value-added " goods such as high-fructose corn syrup and ethanol . Large meat-packers also thrived , turning cheap , taxpayer-subsidized corn and soy into food for animals that do n't even naturally eat grains . As a result , beef , poultry and pork markets became highly profitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 , the number of U.S. farms has plunged from around 5.5 million to just over 2 million . Federal farm policy has not just been stubbornly ineffectual at achieving its aim of bringing supply and demand into line , despite annual cash infusions routinely in excess of $10 billion . It also has given rise to , or at least done nothing to check , a food production and distribution system that inflicts vast environmental and public health destruction . According to the USDA , dietrelated maladies such as diabetes and obesity cost us some $70 billion per year . Apologists for U.S. agricultural policy point out that these titanic taxpayer subsidies and external health and environmental costs buy us the world 's cheapest food System ; we spend a smaller percentage of disposable income ( which does not include subsidies ) on food than any other nation on the planet . But even on these grounds , U.S. food policy fails . The USDA reports that 11 percent of U.S. families-representing some 35 million people-chronically lack access to sufficient food . And most of the rest of us are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . MOVING FORWARD Given the depth of these dysfunctions , the Bush administration 's agenda for the 2007 farm bill is weak medicine indeed . It offers nothing substantial to remedy agricultures structural supply/demand imbalance , nor does it seriously address the gaping public health and environmental damage wrought by the food production system . The Bush proposal , for all its claims of fiscal restraint , would still cost taxpayers $87.8 billion over the next five years , USDA chief Mike Johanns acknowledged . Rather than paying out cash direcdy to farmers , what if we invested it in rebuilding local food infrastructure , helping farmers transition to organic production , and research into increasing the productivity of sustainable agriculture ? The time has come to reject old models and demand policies that align the needs of farmers with those of consumers ( including those with low incomes ) , and with public health and environmental protection .
