That 's how it starts , with the trash . Someone is swapping the trash , silently and insidiously , all over town . On the Promenade des Aubes , the rich lift the lids of their silvery pails and find used Pampers stuffed into empty boxes of Hamburger Helper ; well-bred aunts hold up low-watt bulbs and shake them gingerly , as if the gritty rattle could give them a clue to how these dim , gray globes got there . At first they are perplexed ; some feel menaced , but everyone is too embarrassed to ask questions . How can we take our friends aside , they ask , our neighbors , and accuse them of nosing about in our trash ? We are a private and well-behaved community , with good personal habits . <p> The poor , meanwhile , find the rich people 's salads . As they huddle in their meager dwellings along Petroleum Parkway , they can not comprehend the meaning of the lacy red lettuce leaves that flutter faintly in their stinking , dented cans , nor the strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the lanes , nameless and grim , their children finger the thick castoff stationery of the affluent-ivory laid , embossed , and stenciled , with words like " the Hon. " and " Esq . " - and wonder what has happened to their grease-spotted newsprint which balled so easily , so satisfyingly , in the fist . <p> Class distinctions grow fuzzy , causing car collisions , as no one knows whom to stop for in traffic . That is bad enough , but the mess soon becomes professional-the Banking District smeared with coal mine soot , the Garment District mysteriously studded with spittoons . Shirtwaist sweatshops pump out rolled cigars , bagels , and film . Where can you go for a proper haircut , a hot dog , or an airtight will ? Nobody knows . <p> It 's the next phase that 's personal . Intimate . Male garbage surfacing , shockingly , in female receptacles . And vice versa . Inevitably , gender distinctions blur , for how can a man pronounce himself a bachelor when he finds his Rubbermaid loaded with sodden Maxipads ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staining the sacks of the innocent . Condoms in kiddie garbage , the lids stamped with grimacing Ronald McDonald , his hair an alarming carrot , his tongue lolling , blue , diseased . Spinsters , disposing of frayed thread and yogurt cups , are assaulted by the garbage of a family of five-used coloring books , bicycle grease , congealed macaroni flowing out in a great vomitus from their demure wicker baskets . <p> Predictably , people suffer identity crises . For who are we , if not what we leave behind ? To know our refuse is to know ourselves , what we have used and consumed , fondled , rejected , outgrown . But what have we thrown away ? All of a sudden , we recognize in our trash bins the very items we can not do without-riches in our shredders , silky and spangled , mysteries in our dumpsters , looming and lush . These are hints to hidden identities , these are found objets d'art-behold the sculpture of gum in an ashtray , the ambiance of a tattered lampshade . " How could I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint and empty cans of lard as if they are lost children . Soon everyone is saving lemon rinds , dried snot , and flat tires ; they cling to boll weevils , Spam , and shopping mall tunes . Those of a more cerebral bent memorize ISBN numbers , thread counts , and the etymology of the word " aardvark . ' Meanwhile , people are throwing away their beds , their doors , their meat , not to mention first kisses and favorite scatological jokes . <p> And yet , who is to say ? What , after all , is trash , is refuse-what is fit to be flicked , chucked , flung ? How does anyone know what to throw away and what to keep safe , secure , and orderly , in their homes and in their minds ? Why do n't they commit to memory the words of a television jingle for baked beans , let 's say , or for flexible flea collars , and forget the ages of their children , the taste of grandmother 's tomato sauce , or their own favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people find themselves forgetting . Yes , they can rattle off the capitals of tiny island nations , but how abashedly they stammer when it comes to Beethoven ( was that the Minister of Culture under Hitler ? or a German cooking utensil ? ) . They know the Latin term for blowfish but grope for the names of their wives , friends , mothers-in-law . Soon they 've forgotten their own and fall into addressing each other as Joe , Bob , and Merle . They grow confused on their way home , brokers banging on doors of tract homes , demanding Scotch and soda of hapless Peruvian women they imagine they wed in a ballroom some June day long ago . They get lost on their way to work ; window dressers climb into buses and drive them into billboards , piano tuners traipse into hospitals and put on scrubs . Many die or lose their spleens . The great maestros of the keyboard wither with shame when they bang their concertos out of key , causing mass exoduses from packed concert halls . Tuxedo tails flap madly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets teem with people , rushing and jouncing each other , stumbling on loose trash . " Where are we going ? " some of them cry , but more are asking , " Where did we come from ? , " a much more frightening question . No one can remember which memories they cast away and which they merely appropriated , like borrowed umbrellas in an unexpected downpour . " My mother was a war nurse , " boldly states one wizened old man , then , with a buckling of the knees , " or was that yours ? " " I was a war nurse ! " a woman cries out , but she is already being swept away by the current of the crowd . " I am your mother ! " She is no more than eighteen . <p> Quiet finally settles on the streets . Everyone has been swept up in piles like so many leaves , so dried up , exhausted , that they fall into oblivion , welcome it with the relief of resignation . Eyes stop darting , and limbs stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty air stirring and spinning the newspapers and dead flowers and Styrofoam cups that lie piled in the gutters so thickly , so softly . It seems that the wind makes a whispering sound , almost murmurs a song , almost forms words they almost think they recognize , while all around them their earthly possessions , weightless and threadbare , lift and blow away . In fact , they barely notice as everything they 've discarded rises up in a gentle , growing whirl , gusting and circling around its axis of dirt and dreams and small gleaming details stored up and tossed away too randomly , too carelessly , even to be mourned . <p> Author Affiliation
