Born into Bondage // AT THE TURN of the nineteenth century , the Eastern Shore of Maryland was in many ways a world apart - the rich , rolling fields semicircling Chesapeake Bay , abutting Delaware to the east and grazing Pennsylvania to the north . Fields dappled with sun and lush with grain were crisscrossed by dozens of waterways throughout the peninsula , joining rivers flowing from marshes out to the beckoning salt water . Waterfowl and wildlife were abundant , offering hunters as rich a harvest as that gathered by those who cultivated the land . The Eastern Shore was separated from its sister slave counties by the oyster beds that spread underneath the water to Maryland 's other , western , shore , where the bustling ports of Annapolis and Baltimore dominated the regional economy . // Beaver traders originally populated the Eastern Shore , but by the 1660s the pelt trade was depleted and planters began to settle the region . Commercial rather than domestic agriculture flourished , as tobacco farms dominated at first . By the 1750s , fields of tobacco were replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor intensive and more profitable to plant food for export to the West Indies . Philadelphia merchants moved south along Indian trails , scouting for grain , finding eager suppliers along the Choptank River . // In early America , the planters who settled the marshes of the Eastern Shore , the African Americans who struggled within the bonds of slavery there , and the clusters of emancipated blacks who formed pockets of liberty within the countryside created a complex tangle of competing agendas . Black and white , slave and free , acquisitive and hardscrabble crowded together within this narrow strip of Maryland . // This was the world into which Harriet Tubman was born and came of age , a time and place gnarled by slavery 's contradictions . She was born near Bucktown in Dorchester County , Maryland , to parents who named her Araminta and cared for her deeply . Yet because she was born a slave , the exact year of her birth remains unknown , unrecorded in an owner 's ledger - lost even to the parents and child themselves . // Most accounts offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1820 , roughly two hundred years after the first boatload of Africans was sold off a Dutch slave ship in 1619 at Jamestown , Virginia . " Circa " affixed before a birth year is one of the most common legacies of slavery . " Like sources of the Nile , " the antebellum black leader Samuel R. Ward confessed , " my ancestry , I am free to admit , is rather difficult of tracing . " Harriet believed that she was born in 1825 , and testified to this fact on more than one occasion . // When she died , her death certificate indicated her birth year was 1815 . Her gravestone listed her year of birth at 1820 . Whatever the year affixed , details of the earliest years of Araminta Ross are equally obscure . And so is her place of birth . Educated guesses place her mother at several different locations during the period 1815-1825 , but the Brodess plantation near Bucktown , Maryland , is most likely her place of birth and is certainly where she spent her earliest years , with her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no family Bible with names inscribed survived , and family records present conflicting accounts about the names and the number of Tubman 's brothers and sisters . // There is no firm evidence of Araminta 's place in the birth order . However , she later recalled that she was left in charge of both a baby and another younger brother while her mother went to cook up in " the Big House . " Tubman also indicated that she had older siblings , so clearly she was born somewhere in the middle of a string of children , perhaps nearly a dozen . She might have arrived near the end , as her mother was in her forties when she was born . // Araminta was born to Harriet Green and Benjamin Ross , a slave couple who spent a good deal of their married life in close proximity to one another . They struggled , like most enslaved spouses , to create conditions that would allow them to live together , or at least near each other . They negotiated with their owners - and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more stable family life . // With each new child , hope might spring anew for slave parents , and Tubman was no exception . She recalled that her cradle was carved from a gum tree - most likely by her father , who was a skilled woodsman . She remembered being the center of attention when young white women from the Big House visited the slave cabins . They playfully tossed her in the air when she was just a toddler . These two hazy memories - the cradle and being tossed in the air - are Tubman 's only recorded recollections from her youngest years . // Harriet confessed that during her youth she was described as being " one of those Ashantis . " While she may have had ancestors from Ghana who were of Asante lineage , there is no evidence for this . Perhaps it was the Asante proverbs that Harriet picked up as a young girl ( " Do n't test the depth of a river with both feet " ) that led her to these claims . All her grandparents might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . // Tubman 's mother 's mother arrived on a slave ship from Africa , was bought by an Eastern Shore family named Pattison , and was given the name Modesty . She gave birth to a daughter named Harriet , who was called Rit ( by her family ) and Rittia ( in Pattison records ) sometime before 1790 . In one biographical article published the year before Tubman died , the author alleged that her mother , Rit , was the daughter of a " white man , " but there is no mention of this in any other records or in family lore . In 1791 Harriet Green was listed as property in the will of Atthow Pattison : " I give and bequeath to my granddaughter Mary Pattison , one Negro girl named Rittia and her increase until she and they arrive to forty-five years of age . " This language was standard in nineteenth-century wills and indicated that Rittia was to be given her freedom at forty-five , as would any of her issue born while she was a slave . // If Harriet Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pattison himself - this would explain why she was given this special dispensation . It was not an uncommon practice among Chesapeake planters to make a provision for the emancipation of illegitimate , mixed-race off-spring . Mary Pattison inherited Rittia in 1797 and three years later she married planter Joseph Brodess . It was also not uncommon for the father of an illegitimate , mixed-race daughter to " give " the slave daughter to his legitimate white daughter - much as Sally Hemings was brought to the Thomas Jefferson household by his new wife , Martha , as part of her dowry . Half sisters commonly lived under the same roof as mistress and slave . // Whatever their relationship , Rit accompanied her mistress to a new household after Mary wed Joseph Brodess , on March 19 , 1800 . Brodess and his brothers inherited a 400-acre plot of land only six miles east of Chesapeake Bay , known as " Eccleston 's Regulation Rectified . " This land had come to their father to settle a debt in 1792 . The nearest settlement was Bucktown. // Even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly all accounts suggest he was a " full-blooded Negro , " which may have been to contrast his bloodline with that of his wife . His owner indicated he was born in 1795 , which would have made him years younger than his wife . However , this was Ben 's age as calculated by a master who inherited him . As Ben was also entitled to his freedom at the age of forty-five , his master may not have been scrupulous about Ben 's year of birth . Postponing emancipation meant maintaining added income from the labor of a skilled slave . // As slaves , Tubman 's mother and father were forced to do a master 's bidding , their child 's fate determined by their chattel status . Araminta was doubtless provided little more than the bare necessities of life . Planters doled out a minimum of food to keep slave offspring alive . Clothing for these children was scanty and inadequate . One former slave recalled : The clothes that I wore did not amount to much , just a one-piece dress or gown . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole cut in the bottom for me to stick my head thru , and the corners cut out for armholes . We never wore underclothes , not even in the winter .... We never had more than one at a time , and when they had to be washed , we went naked until they had dried . // To an owner a slave child was purely a commodity , one whose labor could be bartered , whose sole purpose was his own gain . The clarity of this fact overwhelms any effort to give Araminta a childhood . // Slavery 's ferocious foothold in British North America began in the Chesapeake region , where Araminta spent her entire youth . By the first decades of the seventeenth century , when attempts at permanent settlement of European colonies commenced , land was bounteous but labor was scarce . The English in North America welcomed and eventually institutionalized human bondage , fueling a boom in the African slave trade . // By the time of the American Revolution , slavery was as much a part of Maryland as the tobacco planted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although they were shifting into grain agriculture by 1800 , slaveholders on the Eastern Shore owned , on average , eleven slaves apiece . // The children of the earliest Africans in the North American colonies were not always born into bondage . Some blacks came as sailors and explorers . Others came as indentured laborers later granted their freedom . A few of these went on to own slaves themselves . But free blacks continued in the minority , and over time , racial boundaries became more rather than less rigid . Even after the prolonged battle for independence , when cries for liberty rang throughout the countryside , opportunities for both emancipation and free blacks diminished . Whites assumed the innate inferiority of those with darker skin and imposed their prejudices through custom and law . // For example , Maryland slave law took a dramatic turn in 1712 , when the colonial legislators adopted a new measure : the status of a child would follow the status of its mother , partus sequitur ventrem . This statute over-turned centuries of patriarchal tradition and law . This radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most especially white males coupling with slave women . // As the number of persons of color with white ancestry began to grow , the exponential growth of a mixed-race population presented a threat to the white hierarchy . The 1712 law allowed white men to pursue their appetites and maintain the status quo , while white women were hemmed in by increasingly rigid prohibitions and restrictions on their behavior . A white man who fathered a slave child could mask his illicit sexual connection . // A white woman risked not just ostracism , but exile or worse if she was discovered in any sexual connection with a black . By law , any child born to her would be born free . Abolitionist Frederick Douglass , who was born in 1818 on a plantation on Maryland 's Eastern Shore , near present-day Easton - less than thirty miles from Harriet Tubman 's own place of birth - never knew the name of his father . Speculation points to a white slaveholder , perhaps his mother 's master , but the details of his lineage remain unconfirmed . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cotton gin ( 1793 ) fueled a stampede of slaveholders further south and west . Fortunes could be made planting cotton once an easier , inexpensive way of processing the crop was developed . Settlers began pouring into the new states of Kentucky and Tennessee , where Revolutionary War veterans cashed in on land grants . Georgia , Alabama , Mississippi , and eventually Louisiana lured thousands onto their rich soils with a promise of extravagant fortunes , all to be made in the wake of slavery 's widening sphere . // By 1808 the external slave trade was prohibited due to constitutional mandate . After almost two hundred years of imports , cutting off the supply of slaves from Africa and the Caribbean had a profound impact on slavery in the United States - with especially drastic results for slaves in the upper South , where Tubman and her family lived . // The domestic slave trade became crucial to slaveholders eager to settle the southwestern frontier . Suddenly , enslaved African American women , already expected to perform harsh and exacting physical labor , became the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a frenzy to see their plantation economy thrive and to keep slavery booming . Cotton was not a cash crop in Maryland , but its plantations produced one of the most invaluable crops for the southern antebellum market : slaves . The children of slaves quickly became a vital commodity and source of income for cash-poor planters of the Chesapeake , and of increasing significance to the prosperity of the lower South . // When the international slave trade ended , the enslaved population in America was not quite 2 million . Less than fifty years later , with the outbreak of the Civil War , slaves in the American South numbered nearly 3.5 million . This was an astonishing growth rate , given the high mortality among slaves , especially infant mortality . Slave babies commonly succumbed to any number of childhood diseases that plagued all newborns in the South but that visited the slave cabins with depressing regularity . The mortality rate for black children in the Chesapeake during the first half of the nineteenth century was double that of white infants . While enslaved mothers were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality spiked . Further , many slave mothers had to contend with their own ill health during the winter season , when congestive diseases might fell both mother and child . These illnesses proved more often fatal for infants and young children . // The southern climate also meant that blacks , and especially slave children , endured exposure to malaria , cholera , smallpox , and a range of fevers , including the deadly " yellow jacket " ( yellow fever ) . In the antebellum South any outbreak or epidemic ( with the exception of malaria ) hit African Americans in much higher numbers than whites . Despite these health and medical statistics , the increase in the slave population was explosive . By comparison , while the black female birth rate skyrocketed during the half century leading up to the Civil War , the white female birth rate in the country was declining , and reduced by half by century 's end . During this same period approximately 10 percent of adolescent slaves in the upper South were sold by owners ; another 10 percent were sold off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
