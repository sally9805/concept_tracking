Too often , too many of us living with MS find that anxiety about accessibility and our health care overcome the lure of adventure , and we deny ourselves travel vacations . Las Vegas understands what we want , andmore important-gives us freedom from what we do n't want . There 's glitz , glamour , entertainment , great food , family fun , shopping , sports , sights , and , oh yes , gambling . You can travel around the world in this one city , touring from ancient Egypt and Rome to Paris , New York , and the Caribbean-even taking a gondola ride through the canals of Venice . Sound amazing ? . The truly amazing part is how accessible and affordable Las Vegas is . I worried about the heat and its effect on my energy and health . But even in the middle of June , it was no problem-the heat was , as advertised , desert-dry , and all the hotels , casinos , and attractions were air conditioned . As soon as we landed at the airport , Las Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxi ; the barrier-free public spaces ; the level walkways and free trams that connect the hotels ; the well-designed guest rooms in our hotel . Since much of the city is new construction , designed to comply with the ADA guidelines , I had no difficulty maneuvering my electric cart everywhere . Add to that comfort the 24-hour-a-day availability of food , spa services , and fine hotel medical care , and it 's easy to see why Las Vegas is a destination where everyone can simply relax and enjoy . What to do first ? There is definitely something for everyone in Las Vegas . Shows Cirque du Soleil 's acrobatic " Mystere " and " O " are at the high end but utterly incredible and worth the cost . Big-name entertainers abound , but there are also many moderately priced revues with singers , dancers , and comedians . The free or lowcost shows and attractions include : The Bellagio 's water and light show outside and conservatory of flowers inside The Venetian 's " Streets of Venice " , complete with gondola rides ( accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat ) Treasure Island 's pirate ship battle The Mirage 's " Secret Garden " and the white tigers of Siegfried and Roy Fremont Street Experience 's laser light show Excursions and activities Hoover Dam and Lake Mead are about 1 1/2 hours away . Bus tours are available . The visitors ' center is well designed and accessible . To explore nature ( early in the morning to avoid the heat ) you can choose a hike , a hot-air balloon trip , or a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon . Shopping in Las Vegas is as much a draw as gambling-from pricey worldfamous boutiques in the luxury hotels , to malls with hundreds of stores , to discount outlet malls . Swimming , golf , tennis , and health spas are everywhere . Instead of gambling , I spent $25 for a day pass to the Canyon Ranch Health Spa in the Venetian Hotel . The pass included all classes and use of the gym equipment and pools . Facials , massages , and personal training were extra . I was assisted by the instructors in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated . The Liberace Museum , loaded with rhinestones and kitsch , is , well , one of a kind , and the Children 's Discovery Museum is a ftm place for kids of any age . Dining The hotels along the strip are themes come true , and so are their buffet feasts . With over 50 of them , we certainly have n't tried them all . Our criteria are quality , presentation , and accessibility . Our favorites : Orlean.s ' French Market ( inexpensive ) ; Treasure Island and Mirage ( moderate ) ; Paris and Bellagio ( expensive ) . The unspoken policy in many is to seat guests with disabilities first-so just wheel up to the head of the line . Of course , there 's fine restaurant dining too . Both Emeril 's and Spago lived up to their reputations . Gambling Yes , you can gamble . Slot machines are in the airport , the casinos , even the dry cleaners . The casinos have nickel slots and minimum $500-a-hand blackjack tables . Wheelchair-height tables are available . We like to watch other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best entertainment in the city . Planning your trip Tell your travel agent or reservation clerk exactly what your disabilities and needs are . Bring , borrow from the hotel , or rent a wheelchair or scooter for the long distances . Save your energy for having fun . Order show tickets in advance ( the hardto-get tickets can be purchased up to 90 days in advance ) . Buy trip-cancellation insurance that covers pre-existing conditions . Remember that Sunday through Thursday bookings are the least expensive . Packages can be the best value . Ask your travel agent , or research on the Internet . Do n't book a trip when large conventions are in town , as prices increase . Pack a sweater or jacket for the air conditioning ! Organize your medicines early-and keep them with you . ( See Have Meds , Will Travel on page 27 . ) We have traveled the world , and Las Vegas is , without a doubt , the most accessible city we 've ever visited . We 're eager to return .

But Peckerbrook sucks for one or maybe two specific reasons in addition to all the other reasons high schools suck in general . <p> At Peckerbrook , every pupil is either " artistic " ( as implied by its status as a Performing Arts Magnet School ) or black . This is n't to say that there are n't blackpeople registered in the vaunted arts classes . But in a school that is sixty-five percent African-American ( a " vibrant and culturally rich community " is what the brochure says ) , only five people of color are involved in its arts program , which includes hundreds of students . <p> Most of us white kids are bussed in from the wealthier communities in the northern sector of the county . The rest of us have mothers like mine  --  women living in the squalor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never could , insisting that their sons and daughters are the next Brandos or Streeps or Barbra frickin ' Streisands . <p> The black kids laugh at us " performing " white folk , then deal drugs right in front of the school , selling little bags of weed and crack after the faculty has gone home for the day . <p> Once I had to wait for my mother to pick me up ( she was late , as usual ) , and these four crack-slingers walked over and just started beating on my head . A Samaritan in a BMW pulled up moments later and chased them away with an umbrella and his middle-class white-man authority . <p> My first day in drama this tall , unaffected Amazon of a girl sits beside me as I cocoon myself in a corner of the theater . <p> " You do n't need to worry , " she assures me . " All the drama people are cool . " I try smiling at her . <p> She is beautiful . She says her name is Tabitha . And unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred here from all points north , she has a true Southern accent  --  and breasts that round out the top of her shirt like an answer to prayer . <p> Class begins with a series of exercises where everybody lies on the floor and focuses on their breathing . <p> Breathe . <p> Listen to yourself breathe . <p> Then comes the " stress reduction " massage . <p> Tabitha scoots up next to me and asks if I 'll " do " her . <p> " Do ? Yeah . . . ok . " <p> She lies in front of me and waits , eyes closed . <p> I touch her , allowing the palms of my hands to skim the linen of her shirt . <p> She asks if I am going to actually rub her back or just pretend . <p> " This part is n't supposed to be acting , " she informs me . <p> " I know , I was just warming up , " I say , trying to sound natural . <p> I begin at her neck , for real this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the spine and out to the shoulder blades , allowing my hands to pass over the contours of her body . <p> This goes on for some time before she begins moaning softly and I have to . . . readjust . With every moan I become more aroused and with every readjustment it seems she moans louder . <p> " Go under my shirt , " she says . <p> I pull her shirt up to the middle of her back , just below the bra strap , and watch as goose bumps form . She is magnificent . <p> " Pull it up all the way . " <p> " All the way ? " I whisper . <p> " Yeah , all the way , " she repeats , her head on her forearms , eyes still closed . She rises off the floor slightly so that I can get her t-shirt past her bra . I look around at the rest of the class to gauge how they are dealing with the striptease developing in their midst but no one seems to have the slightest idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , trying to keep my breathing in check . <p> " It doooes . " <p> I swallow . " Good . " <p> I continue rubbing , trying to be professional about it and all . <p> Then she pushes herself up onto her forearms , turns to face me . " Two things , " she says . " I want you to take your index and middle fingers on both hands , bend them at the knuckle , then pinch and twist . It feels better when it hurts a little . " <p> She lies down again and closes her eyes like before . I look at my hands and practice the twisting motion with my fingers before I go back to work on her . " What was the second thing ? " <p> " Oh , that 's right , " Tabitha purrs as I pinch her . " Unsnap my bra . " <p> I want to make love to her . <p> " How do you do that ? " Now I 'm panicking . <p> " Just push the ends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally the clasp loosens and separates . Her bra slips away and there I sit , straddling her bottom with a hard-on , her naked back begging me to touch it , to make love to it with my fingers . I can see her tan lines and how the sides of her breasts remain their natural flesh tone , completely uncorrupted by sun . <p> The more I rub the harder I get and I wonder if she can feel me through my pants . I want her to feel me . The tanned canvas of her back is mine for the taking and I imagine myself an artist of the highest vocation , sculpting her into immortality . <p> Her skin gathers between my fingers , and no matter how hard I pull or pinch , it always snaps back into place leaving a red welt , the only reminder of my concentrated ministrations . She moans with every twist , every pull . Her breasts protrude on either side of her prone body , pushed out slightly . There are no visible nipples or anything of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the unmistakable sight of finality , fullness , completeness , the ultimate signifier of female perfection . <p> It occurs to me that I 've never seen a real-life breast until that moment . <p> " Why 'd you stop rubbing ? " <p> I 'm stuck , staring at her breast swells , my hands motionless on her back . <p> <br> Continues ...
