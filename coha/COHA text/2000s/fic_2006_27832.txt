Rome at election time ! Can there be any prospect more pleasant ? Is it possible for any place to be more wonderful ? For any activity to be more agreeable ? Certainly not for me , and not that year . I was just back from Cyprus after a successful , mildly glorious , and none-too-bloody campaign to suppress a recent outburst of piracy . I had found their base , destroyed their fleet , and , best of all , captured a good part of their loot . The captives I had returned to their homes and had restored a part of the loot to the people from whom it had been stolen . Luckily for me , a great deal of the loot had been impossible to trace , so it belonged to me . I had split up some of it with my men , made a handsome donation to the Treasury , and with the rest had cleared my considerable debts . I now had reached the proper age and had accumulated the requisite military experience to stand for the office of praetor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metella , and the men of my family expected automatic election to the higher offices by right of birth . To top it all off , the weather was beautiful . It seemed that all the gods of Rome were on my side . As usual , the gods were about to play one of their infamous jokes on me . The morning it allbegan I was at the Porticus Metelli on the Campus Martius , across from the Circus Flaminius , presiding over the consecration of my monument . This porticus , a handsome rectangle of colonnades surrounding a fine courtyard , had been erected by my family for the convenience of the people and to our own glory , and we paid for its upkeep . Some of my pirate loot had bought it a new roof . A monument in the Forum might have been more prestigious , but by that time the Forum was already so cluttered with monuments that one more would not have been noticeable . Besides , mine was not very large . But in those days the City was spilling outside its old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and drill ground for the legions of old , was now a prosperous suburb , growing full of expensive businesses and fine houses . And my monument was n't just a statue , it was a naval trophy : a pillar studded with the bronze rams of the ships I had captured . Actually , the pirate ships had had small , unimpressive rams , since pirates usually tried to board rather than sink ships , and mostly they raided shore villages so their ships had to be able to beach and escape quickly : not an easy task when you have a large ram sticking out in front . So I had had big , fearsome-looking rams cast , one for each pirate ship . Atop the pillar was a statue of Neptune , raising his trident in victory . A little grandiose for a campaign against scummy pirates , but that year all the real military glory was Caesar 's so I took what I could get . I was dressed in my toga candida , specially whitened with fuller 's earth , to announce my candidacy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients applauded as the trophy was unveiled and priests of Bellona and Neptune pronounced the consecration . They were both relatives of mine and glad to help out . Quintus Hortensius Hortalus , my father 's old friend , now grown old and portly , took the auguries and pronounced them favorable in his incomparable voice . Many of Rome 's dignitaries were there . Pompey was there to offer his congratulations , as was the tiresome Cato . I would have liked to have Cicero in attendance , but he and his brother were off in Syria putting down a Parthian incursion . My wife , Julia , and many of her relations attended , providing perhaps an excessively large Caesarian contingent . Far too many people already considered me to be one of Caesar 's flunkies . My good friend Titus Milo could not attend as he was in exile for killing Clodius and had not long to live , although I could not know that at the time . Still , the morning was glorious , the monument was fine , my future was bright . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with endless responsibilities and duties and costing a fortune to support . I would have imperium and would be attended by lictors . With luck , when I left office I would be given a province to govern , one that was at peace , where I could get rich in relative safety . Most politicians wanted a province at war where they could win glory and loot , but I knew that any such position would put me in competition with Caesar and Pompey . I knew far too much of both men to want any part of that . My father , ailing and leaning on a cane , had managed to attend . He swore he 'd live to see me elected consul , but I feared he would never make it that long . Indeed , it depressed me to look at the knot of my senior kinsmen who accompanied him . All the great Metelli were dead or too elderly for political significance . Dalmaticus and Numidicus had died with my grandfather 's generation , the generation of Marius . My father 's generation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day but also growing old and very stout ; Metellus Scipio , a pontifex , a Caecilian by adoption ; and Nepos , closer to me in age but Pompey 's man , and Pompey was a has-been if only his supporters would realize it . They had all been Sulla 's supporters , and Sulla had been dead for more than twenty-five years . The Metelli of my own generation were still numerous , but they were political nonentities . I included myself in this category . Also beside me was my freedman Hermes , still uncomfortable in his citizen 's toga , a garment to which he had been entitled for only a few months . Of course , for official purposes his name was Decius Caecilius Metellus , but that was for his tombstone . He elected to keep his slave name , even though it was Greek . Well , it was a god 's name after all , and many citizens of my generation went by Greek nicknames , some of which were quite indecent and for which there were no Latin equivalents . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum , past the temples of Apollo and Bellona , through the Carmentalis Gate in the old wall , around the base of the Capitol , and into the northwestern end of the great assembly place . It was even more thronged than usual , with the elections coming up and everyone who counted for anything in from the country . It was the season for parties and politics , for intrigue , bribery , and coercion . At this time most of the Senate had split into two factions : pro-Caesarian and anti-Caesarian . Caesar was overwhelmingly popular with the plebs at Rome and hated violently by a large part of the aristocratic faction . As usual , such polarization led to strange juxtapositions . Men who , a few years previously , had reserved their greatest scorn for Pompey , now courted him as the only viable rival to Caesar . Theirs was a short-sighted policy , but desperate men will grasp at anything that promises respite from the thing they fear . I tried to keep my distance from all such factions , but my family connections made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus Claudius Marcellus , was among the most rabid of the anti-Caesarians and had not attended my little unveiling ceremony . The other consul , Sulpicius Rufus , congratulated me ostentatiously . Such were the times . Doing the usual round of meeting and greeting , we made a leisurely progress toward the foot of the Capitol , near the old meeting place of the comitia , where all the year 's candidates were accustomed to congregate , stand around , preen , and generally proclaim their willingness to serve Senate and People . Here our friends and well-wishers would drop by , take our hands , and trumpet loudly to anyone who would listen what splendid fellows we all were . It was one of our less dignified customs and a constant source of amazement to foreigners , but we 'd always done it that way and that was a good enough reason to continue . As a candidate for an office with imperium , it was my first order of business to greet the candidates I was supporting for the junior offices in order to take each by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First to get my hand was Lucius Antonius , standing for quaestor that year . Accompanying him was his brother Caius , who was himself serving as quaestor and would be standing down with the upcoming election . These were the brothers of the famous Marcus Antonius , who was serving with Caesar in Gaul . I had always gotten on well with these brothers , who were bad men but good company . " Best of luck , Lucius ! " I exclaimed , clapping him on the shoulder and raising a cloud of chalk dust . There was always a temptation to overdo it with the chalk when standing for office . " And to you , Decius , " the younger brother said , his eyes slightly unfocused and his voice a bit unsteady . At the wine already , I thought . Typical Antonian . " I suppose you have your purple-bordered toga already ordered , " Caius said , referring to my aforementioned certainty of election . " As luck would have it , there was some Tyrian dye among the items I acquired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody who 'd missed my monument dedication of my latest distinction . " Julia wove me a new toga and dyed the border herself . It 's on the drying rack right now . A very handsome garment , I might add . " Well , my wife had supervised her women while they did the actual weaving , and , of course she had called in a professional dyer to do the border . That purple dye is the most expensive substance in the world , even more dear than saffron or silk . " Some people have all the luck , " said Lucius . " By the time our brother gets through with Gaul there wo n't be any gold , wine , or good-looking women left to steal . " " It 'll be another ten years before there 's more pirate loot to pick up , " Caius said tipsily . " If Pompey conquers Parthia , there 'll be nothing left for the rest of us . " " I suppose there 'll always be India , " I said , not really serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't take the problem as seriously as those two dedicated thieves . " Too far , " Caius said . " You have to march for a year just to get there . Now Egypt --  " " Forget it , " I said . " The Senate will never let even an Antonius take Egypt . " This was a statement fraught with great portent , had I but known it . " Yes , just getting elected quaestor is problem enough for now , " Caius said . " And , Decius , do n't worry about Fulvius . You know how to handle people like him . " " Yes , " said Lucius , " the man is nothing . Do n't let him distract you from the election . " " What ? Fulvius ? " But they were already turning away to return the greetings of the latest batch of well-wishers . I walked away wondering at this enigmatic advice . Which Fulvius did they mean ? There were ten or twelve senators of that name known to me , and any number of equites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took up my place with the other candidates for the praetorship . After an hour of loud hailing and greeting , I was approached by one of my least favorite Romans , Sallustius Crispus . The year before he had been Tribune of the People , and in that powerful office had established himself as Caesar 's champion . Upon the death of Clodius , he had tried to fill those vacated sandals . Since he considered me Caesar 's man , too , he acted as if we were great friends . Sullustius fancied himself a historian , and for twelve years he had tried to weasel from me everything I knew about the sorry Catiline business . He was an insinuating , sleazy wretch with overlarge ambitions . Actually , I suppose he was a typical Roman politician of the day and no worse than many others I knew . I just could n't help disliking him . One thing was for certain : with his love of gossip , Sallustius would know who this Fulvius might be and what sort of grievance he had . " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have been at your monument dedication , but I was seeing my brother off . " His younger brother , surnamed Canini for some reason I never learned , had been another of the year 's quaestors . " Where is he bound ? " I asked , waving heartily to a band of my Subura neighbors who were there to support me and others of our district standing for office that year . " Syria . He 's to be proquaestor for Bibulus . " " He 'll be safe , then . Bibulus is a cautious man . He 's doing as little fighting as possible and leaving what there is to his legates . " Bibulus had been careful to arrive late to take up administration of his province . Young Cassius Longinus , a mere proquaestor who had survived the debacle at Carrhae , had been successfully driving the Parthians back until he arrived . The boy deserved a triumph for it ; but with the tiny forces at his command he had been unable to score a decisive victory , and he was considered too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little praise for so much accomplishment may well account for his later hostility toward Caesar -- but I get ahead of myself . " Just as well , " Sallustius was saying . " The talents of my family lie in the literary field , not the military . " I would have said neither , but I did n't . " A little while ago I was told to ignore somebody named Fulvius . Who is he and why should I ignore him ? " " You have n't heard ? " he said gleefully . Sallustius loved to be the bearer of bad news . " This morning one Marcus Fulvius denounced you before the extortion court for corruption and plundering in Cyprus and adjacent waters . " " What ! " At my shout heads turned so violently that you could hear vertebrae popping all over the Forum . " Calm yourself , Decius . " He smiled . " The man 's just an aspiring politician out to make a name for himself . Prosecuting a successful man for corruption is how it 's usually done . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , but Verres really did plunder Sicily with legendary thoroughness . I did nothing of the sort in Cyprus ! " " What difference does that make ? " he asked , honestly puzzled . " You should be glad it 's an accusation of extortion and plunder . It might 've been for screwing a Vestal Virgin , and think how undignified the trial would 've been then . " " I 'm to take it that his accusation contained more than just a lot of noise and wind ? " " He says he has a number of witnesses to back him up . " " Cyprians ? He 'll be laughed out of Rome if he hauls a pack of half-Greek mongrels before a Roman jury . " " He claims he has Roman citizens ready to swear before the gods what a bad boy you were . " " Damn ! " I had offended a number of Romans during my stay on Cyprus . Most were businessmen and financiers , who were profiting handsomely from the pirates ' activities . " Who is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sallustius would know , and he did n't disappoint me . " He 's from Baiae , been here in Rome for the last few months , making connections and learning politics from high-placed friends . I do n't doubt he 's had some expert advice as to how to go about it . " " I 've spent so much time away from Rome these past few years it 's hard to keep track of everyone . Baiae , you say ? " I tried to make some sort of connection . Then it dawned on me . " Is this man Clodius 's brother-in-law ? " He grinned his ugly grin . " He 's Fulvia 's brother . " Fulvia , the widow of my old enemy , had quite possibly the worst reputation of any woman in Rome . " But since Clodius was killed , she 's taken up with Marcus Antonius , and he bears me no ill-will . It does n't make sense . " " You 're just a convenient target , Decius . You 're just back from overseas with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing for praetor . Why assume that it 's personal ? " " You 're probably right . I 'll just handle him the usual way . " Since a serving magistrate could n't be prosecuted , my best tactic would be to stall until after the elections . By the time I stepped down , this pest would have found somebody else to plague . " Like most ambitious men , " Sallustius said , " he 's poor . He may be amenable to a bribe to drop the charges . Would you like me to sound him out ? " How like Sallustius . If I 'd shown a liking for his sister , he 'd have offered to act as pimp . " No , I 'll avoid the trouble if I can , but I refuse to buy my way out of a charge of which I 'm innocent . " " I do n't see why not . Innocence rarely exempts a man from the consequences of a false accusation . Counterattack is usually the way to go . Do n't tell me you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the news and advice , Sallustius . I 'll deal with this my way . " I looked around until I spotted Hermes , near Vulcan 's altar , talking me up to a little group of voters . One of the rules was that a candidate could not canvass for votes personally . Instead , our clients and freedmen did it for us . I caught his eye and beckoned . " You do n't want a drink already , do you ? " he asked as he joined me . " It 's going to be a long day . " This insolence was the result of his years as my personal slave . Also , he knew me all too well . " It 's about to get longer , wretch . Go get my father and any other men of the family who may be standing around and my highest-placed supporters . There 's going to be trouble . " He grinned . " An attack ? " Hermes was an inveterate brawler . " Not the kind you enjoy . A political offensive from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , downcast . " I 'll find them . " My mind seethed even as I smiled and shook hands with well-wishers . How serious was this man 's support ? How would I counter his charges ? How much support could I get behind me ? How long could I stall ? I was going to need legal advice . For this I would automatically have gone to Cicero , but a sea lay between us that year . Father limped toward me , his face as grim as a thundercloud . Hortensius Hortalus was with him , as were Metellus Scipio and Creticus and even Cato . Much as I disliked Cato , I was ready to welcome anyone 's support . " We 've already heard , " Father said , before I could speak . " How did a worm like Marcus Fulvius set this up without us knowing of it ? " " Because we 've paid him no notice at all , I do n't doubt , " Hortalus rumbled . " Whose court was it ? " I asked . " Juventius , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close friend of Clodius . " Wonderful , " I said . " Even dead , Clodius can cause me trouble . " " Time is on your side , " Cato said . " With the election coming up , the court will be sitting for only four more days . " " If Juventius is willing to move fast , " I pointed out , " four days is plenty of time to prosecute me . " I did n't have to point out that a guilty verdict could prevent me from taking my place among the candidates on election day . Even if I were to be voted in anyway , I could be prevented from assuming office on the new year . " We have to get your backside planted on that curule chair before the bugger can haul you before a court , " said the eminently practical Creticus . " Tonight , " Hortalus said , " I 'll go outside the walls and take the auguries . Perhaps I 'll see a sign that the courts ca n't meet for the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's closest friend , " I said . " You 'll be denounced before the Senate for falsifying auguries , even if you see a thunderbolt strike a night-soaring eagle . " " I 'll take Claudius Marcellus with me . Nobody will question his auguries . " He did not refer to the Claudius Marcellus who was one of that year 's consuls , nor to the Claudius Marcellus who was to be one of the next year 's consuls , nor yet to the Claudius Marcellus who was consul the year after that , but rather to yet a fourth Claudius Marcellus , who was the oldest member of the College of Augurs and trusted the way we always trust men who are too old to do much harm . I looked out over the Forum crowd . No uproar yet . I did n't really expect one . Scurrilous accusations against candidates were among the more common entertainments of any election . Strolling entertainers and vendors were everywhere , doing a great business as always when the voters thronged the City . I wished that I could consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own family . But she had gone back home . In any case , it would have been a scandal beyond redemption had I been seen discussing politics with my wife right out in public . " Here he comes ! " It was the excited voice of Sallustius . He was still standing close by , eager to pick up gossip from the Metellan faction . I followed his pointing finger and saw a commotion within the crowd . In the sea of scalps I detected a motion heading our way , the way a shark 's fin cuts the water . As it got closer , the motion resolved itself into a little knot of men striding along purposefully in our direction . In their lead was a tall , light-haired man who had the look of a Forum warrior -- the sort who does all of his fighting in the courts . I recognized some of the men behind him as old followers of Clodius . The others were strangers to me . " Decius Caecilius Metellus ! " the man cried as he reached us . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want ? " For an instant the man was nonplussed . His timing had been upset . " Not you ! I meant your son . " He leveled a skinny finger toward me . " Then why did n't you say so , you whey-faced buffoon ? Until I croak , he 's Decius the Younger . " Our faction whooped and clapped . People began to pack the already crowded area , sensing a good show . " He 's talking to your whelp , you bald-headed old fart ! " shouted one of the man 's flunkies . Father squinted in the man 's direction . " Who 's that ? Oh , I remember you . I had your mother flogged from the City for whoring and spreading disease . " Of course , he had no idea who the man was , but he would never let a trifling detail like that stop him . I was maintaining a dignified silence , which the light-haired man duly noted . " Ca n't you speak Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger ? I accuse you of bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with enemies of Rome during your naval operations on Cyprus ! " " And you would be --  ? " I inquired . " I am Marcus Fulvius . " He drew himself to his full height , adopting an orator 's pose . My mouth dropped open . " Not the Marcus Fulvius ? The Marcus Fulvius who is renowned in Baiae for public fornication with goats ? The Marcus Fulvius who took on an entire auxilia cohort of Libyan perverts until the oil supply ran out ? To think Rome has been graced with such a celebrity . " Now the whole Forum was laughing . The man 's face reddened , but he held his ground . He was about to shout something when Cato stepped forward , seized his hand , and turned it palmside up . " Here 's a hand that never held a sword , " he said with withering scorn , and nobody could pour on the scorn more witheringly than Marcus Porcius Cato . " Listen to me , you small-town nobody . Go put in some time with the legions , distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse a veteran of Gaul and Iberia , the crusher of pirates and exposer of a score of traitors . " This was making a bit much of my military and court record , but the words were deadly earnest and nobody was laughing now . I doubt that it was affection for me speaking . Cato despised men who came from out of town to make their reputations in Rome . " Any Roman citizen may bring suit against any other in public court , " Fulvius said . " As you know well , Marcus Porcius . " Hortensius Hortalus came forward . " That is very true . In fact , it was my impression that you made this very accusation this morning in the extortion court of Marcus Juventius Laterensis . Wherefore do you now , Marcus Fulvius , repeat these charges here in the ancient and sacred gathering place of the comitia , thus bringing disturbance to the grave deliberations of the citizens of Rome as they partake in the most venerable of our Republican institutions , the choosing among candidates for the highest offices ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , but it was always a joy to hear Hortalus speak . The sonorous vowels of his old-fashioned Latin flowed over the crowd like honey . Fulvius yanked his hand away from Cato . " I speak forth boldly because I want Rome to know it is a degenerate criminal who demands that the citizens grant him imperium . This man "  - -  Once again he extended the skinny , slightly dirty-nailed finger toward my face , this time shaking with ill-bridled wrath --  " laid hands on crucial naval stores , public property , citizens ! And sold them for his own profit ! He set his slaves to break into the houses of honest Roman citizens , to beat and torture them until they bought their lives with gold ! He took great bribes from foreign merchants who trafficked with the very pirates he was sent to suppress . This is the man who wants to preside over a court that will try Roman citizens . This is the man who would go forth to govern a propraetorian province and command legions , no doubt to plunder our provincials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about collusion with enemies of Rome ? " I asked . " Beyond all this , " he said , scarcely pausing for breath , " he consorted with the notorious slut Princess Cleopatra , daughter of the degenerate Ptolemy the Flute Player , that disgusting tyrant of Egypt . " At this time not one Roman in a thousand had ever heard of Cleopatra , who was barely seventeen years old . But her father , Ptolemy , was a worldwide joke . " King Ptolemy , " said Metellus Scipio , " has been recognized by the Senate of Rome as the lawful king of Egypt and has been accorded the status of Friend and Ally of the Roman People . Not only do you bring frivolous charges against a blameless servant of the Senate and People , but you slander the daughter of an allied prince . I 've a mind to haul you into court for it . " " Everyone knows old Ptolemy bribed half the Senate to get that title ! " shouted one of Fulvius 's toadies . It was perfectly true , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for silence , and in a few seconds the hubbub calmed . " Marcus Fulvius , you bring serious charges against me , and your slanders are worthless . Bring out your witnesses . " " You will see them in court . " " Then why are you yammering at me here ? " Of course , I knew perfectly well . The man was an unknown , a nobody . He wanted all of Rome to know his name , and by nightfall it surely would . " I am here , " Fulvius announced grandly , " to invite every citizen of Rome to witness my prosecution of the mighty Caecilius Metellus , whose loathsome guilt I shall prove through the testimony of Roman citizens wronged . The gods of Rome themselves will call for his exile ! " This brought cries of admiration for his eloquence , at which he preened . Hortalus spoke again . " You 've learned rhetoric from a good master , Fulvius . That last turn of phrase was from Junius Billienus 's prosecution of Minucius , one hundred and sixty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive , admired by Cicero himself , but he paused for effect and let fall a telling addendum --  " in the consulship of Paullus and Varro . " Half unconsciously , everyone there made some gesture to ward off evil , making apotropaic hand signs , fishing out phallic amulets , or reciting protective cantrips . Those lucky enough to be standing near an altar or statue of a god kissed their hands and pressed them to the sacred object . This we always do when that ill-starred year is mentioned , for it was in the consulship of Paullus and Varro that Hannibal met the greatest Roman army ever assembled and annihilated it at Can nae . At that point a pair of lictors , their fasces shouldered , pushed their way through the crowd and stopped in front of me . " Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger , " said one of them , " you are summoned to appear before the court of the praetor Marcus Juventius Laterensis at dawn tomorrow . " They looked a bit uncomfortable carrying out this commonplace duty . If I should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feared I would remember them with disfavor . " Why wait ? " I said . " Let 's go see him now . " I left my spot and began to walk toward the basilica with my whole crowd behind me . I could n't accomplish anything at court until my trial began , but I did n't want to give Fulvius anymore free publicity at my expense . One of Fulvius 's men , an ugly , scar-faced thug , pushed toward me . " Hey ! You can't --  " He got that far when Hermes stepped up to him and punched him in the face . The boy could hit as hard as any professional boxer , and the man went down like a sacrificial ox . My father clouted another over the head with his cane , and the rest fell back before us . Had something like this occurred just a few years before , there would have been real bloodshed , but Pompey had finally set the city in order , expelled the gangs that had made elections so uproarious , and restored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored and ready for a fight . It was a very short walk to the basilica where Juventius had his court . The lictors had to hold the mob back while we stormed in , interrupting some case he was hearing . Juventius looked up , his face furious . " I will hear your case tomorrow ! Get out of my court ! " He was a hard-faced man of no real distinction . Like most , he had done no more than put in the requisite civil and military time and had spent enough on his games as aedile , and so he got his year in the curule chair . Of course , some would say the same of me . " Tomorrow ! " I yelled . " This malicious wretch has had who knows how many months to put his plot together , to rehearse his perjurious witnesses , to bribe and suborn the testimony he needs to prove his false accusations , and I have until tomorrow to prepare my case ! Citizens ! " I smote my breast dramatically and almost choked on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I was shouting loud enough to be heard outside and sounds of a gratifying agreement came back to me . " Lictors ! " Juventius shouted . " Throw these trespassers out ! " Since his lictors were outside trying to hold the crowd back , they were in something of a quandary . " What 's all this unseemliness ? " The voice was not terribly loud , but all disorder quieted instantly . Pompey entered the basilica , preceded by his twelve lictors . Technically , he was proconsul for Nearer and Farther Spain , but he also had an extraordinary oversight of the grain supply , so he remained in Italy to keep everyone from starving while his legates attended to both Spanish provinces . It was an unheard-of arrangement for a proconsul with full imperium to remain in Italy ; but in this , as in everything else , Pompey was a law unto himself . " Proconsul , " Juventius said , " I 've summoned Metellus the Younger to appear before me tomorrow , and he has shown up instead today , interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . Why should he do less for you ? " Then he turned to me . " Decius , you 've been provoked , but I 'll not have disorder in Roman courts . Go home and get your defense ready .

If I were , at great expense , to dispatch a fast cutter I could bring a few dozen here in about a month . At least I could if it were the sailing season , which it is n't . " " You 'd better think of something , " Pompey advised , " because if your case is carried over into the next year , you ca n't be elected praetor .

We have some serious planning to do . " Continues ...
