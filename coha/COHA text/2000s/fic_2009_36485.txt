I glanced at the Mickey Mouse clock on Gretchen 's desk . It was nine thirty in the morning , a half hour after Prescott 's : Antiques and Auctions ' regular start time , and my assistant was n't there . Gretchen , who was supposed to be back to work yesterday after a two-week Hawaiian vacation , and who , in four years , had never once been tardy , had n't shown up or even called . I was worried sick . <p> I thought again of the man , the stranger , who 'd been trying to reach her . He 'd called frequently while she was out of town , would n't leave a message , and had seemed increasingly frustrated that we would n't reveal details of her schedule . It was company policy that we never gave out specific information about anyone on staff , but he took it as a personal affront . <p> " Has anyone spoken to that guy lately ? " I asked . " You know , the one calling for Gretchen ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his square , black- framed glasses . Fred was an antiques appraiser who 'd joined my firm a couple of years back , moving from New York City to New Hampshire . He was a terrific find  --  he had a keen eye and an educated sensibility . <p> " How did he sound ? " I asked . <p> " Pissed off . He got sarcastic when I told him she was n't available and offered to take a message . He asked if we kept her chained in the back . " <p> " Wow . That 's pretty intense . " <p> Yesterday , I 'd managed to contain my anxiety enough to limit myself to one cheerfully worded , " Welcome home , are you okay ? " <p> voice mail message . Today , I needed to do something else , something more , but I did n't know what , and then I thought of Gretchen 's friend Mandy Tollerson . <p> I 'd first met Mandy about four months ago when Gretchen had solicited my help on her behalf . According to Gretchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete creep , and she was encouraging Mandy to break away . When Mandy had confided to Gretchen that she dreamed of starting her own business , an art gallery , Gretchen had brought her to me , hoping that I 'd fire her up to act , and that somehow being independent in business would make her independent in her romantic relationship , too . Since then , Mandy had stopped by every few weeks with some business questions . Last week , she 'd asked about tracking sales and expenses , and I 'd taught her how to calculate break- even . <p> I dialed her home phone number . A machine picked up after four rings . " Hi , Mandy . It 's Josie . Josie Prescott . Would you give me a call , please ? " I asked , adding my phone number . It was too early to call her at her job  --  she was an assistant manager at the Bow Street Emporium , a high- end gift shop in Portsmouth  --  and I did n't have her cell phone number . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief appraiser . " If you wanted to call someone who knows Gretchen , to see if they 've heard from her , who would it be ? " <p> She tilted her head as she considered my question , her intelligence apparent in her thoughtful expression . Her fine , shoulder-length brown hair hung straight to her shoulders . " She mentioned that a friend was watering her plants while she was gone , but I do n't know who . " <p> I asked the same question of Fred and Eric , my back room supervisor , and got the same answer . I was n't surprised . None of us knew much about Gretchen . From the day she 'd showed up on my doorstep , promising to work hard and help my business grow , until the day she 'd left for vacation , she 'd shared almost nothing about herself . Not long after she started , Sasha had asked her if she was traveling over the holidays to visit family , and she 'd given a vague , peppy response . " Home is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't even know if Gretchen had family . She was inexorably cheerful , physically beautiful , and quick to learn and adapt . She loved celebrity gossip , but about herself she was relentlessly private . I had no idea where she came from or what she did in her free time . <p> Trying to figure out what to do , I unlocked the file cabinet where I stored employee personnel files . On Gretchen 's , the line for an emergency contact was blank . I 'd never noticed that before . I located her condo contact information and called the property manager . Meryl , an associate in the office , listened to my explanation , then put me on hold while she asked for and received permission from her boss to allow me to enter Gretchen 's unit . She agreed to meet me there right away with the key . <p> I told Sasha where I was going . <p> " Please call as soon as you know something , " she requested . <p> I said I would , and as I spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We shared the unspoken fear that something was very , very wrong . <p> I beat Meryl to the Pond View condo complex , where Gretchen owned unit eight , and while I waited for her to arrive , I knocked on Gretchen 's door . Nothing . From my perch on the second- floor balcony , I noticed three cars in the lot , not counting mine , and Gretchen 's was n't one of them . An old Chevy with Tennessee plates was parked closest to Gretchen 's front door . A Ford SUV and a Toyota sat on the other side of the lot . <p> A steady stream of traffic noise rose from the street . I heard a complaining caw , caw from the pond barely visible through a passageway between two buildings . A red minivan turned into the parking lot , parking near the Chevy . <p> A stocky woman of about forty stepped out of the van . She brushed unruly auburn hair out of her eyes as she scanned the area . <p> " Meryl ? " I called . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She saw me waving . " Have you knocked ? " she asked when she joined me . " Yeah . A couple of times . " " Just in case , " she said . She banged the clapper , stared at the <p> ground for a count of fifteen , then clapped again . After another ten <p> seconds ' wait , she looked up . I met her anxious gaze and shrugged . " Let 's do it , " I said . Meryl opened the door and shouted Gretchen 's name before <p> crossing the threshold . There was no reply . We walked inside . The apartment felt very still . Something smelled bad , like rotten eggs , except worse . I heard a hum  --  a low- pitched , soft , machine sound . The refrigerator , I thought , glancing into the empty kitchen . Shoulder to shoulder , Meryl and I edged down a short carpeted hall . Meryl stepped into the living area , stopped short , and screamed . <p> At the sound , my heart began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , her eyes wide open , shocked , and then she crossed herself . <p> My stomach leapt into my throat , then plummeted . I stepped around her to gain a better view . Sprawled on the sofa was a man  --  dead  --  shot . <p> Excerpted from Killer Keepsakes by Jane K. Cleland . Copyright 2009 by Jane K. Cleland .
