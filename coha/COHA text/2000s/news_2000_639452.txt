Using a mix of rounded and hard angles , metal , marble , stone and glass , the redesign fits the fashion of the Pepsi Center , the Denver Public Library and many Lower Downtown lofts . <p> The exterior is a match for San Francisco 's Union Square or Michigan Avenue in Chicago . That 's not a surprise considering the architect , Anthony Belluschi of Chicago , has redesigned some of the nation 's most exclusive downtown shopping areas . <p> The best chance for Tabor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the street , each with a direct entrance and large display windows above . <p> And if they do n't draw you in , perhaps ESPNZone on the east end will . The power shopper 's counterpart might agree to spend Saturday at the mall if it means shooting hoops or reclining in front of the big screen . <p> The west-end stores will stretch back through what now is a handful of small shops , a walkway and , yes , a fountain . Which brings us back to espresso stands . <p> Peaberry 's Coffee and Cigars by Garbox , which face 16th Street on the west end , might have to move as big names in apparel will likely scoop up these front-row spots . <p> The question is who ? <p> The Gap , Banana Republic and Ann Taylor are unlikely , as they have new locations up 16th Street . <p> Forget about a Foley 's , Nordstrom or Neiman Marcus . Too big , say the owners , Equity Office . <p> Old Navy , The Limited and Structure are possibilities because they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is in order . Perhaps a Larry 's Shoes or Casual Corner . Besides clothing , home accessories stores like Crate &; Barrel or Pottery Barn would be perfect . <p> Tabor hopes to balance the chains with local businesses , including some existing mall stores . While some Denver shoppers wrote off Tabor years ago , many current specialty shops and kiosks at Tabor deserve a second look . These are the businesses that have survived - and even thrived - while the center has lagged . <p> A few higher-end apparel and gift boutiques , like those in Cherry Creek North , would also add variety to Downtown and complement value stores up the street such as Ross and T.J. Maxx . <p> But even with a fresh exterior and alluring first-floor stores , the second and third floors are challenged with attracting shoppers , who ca n't see into the mall . <p> Traditional mall shops are expected on those floors . You can never have too many women 's shoe stores . <p> Downtown workers likely will fill the third floor at lunchtime , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overlooking 16th Street . Perfect for people-watching , the patio has prospects for the perfect happy hour . <p> When finished , the new Tabor could help Downtown on the whole . Shoppers can make a day of it , starting at the 1-year-old Denver Pavilions on one end of the 16th Street Mall , work their way to Tabor , then head to trendy Larimer Square for that last espresso . <p> Kelly Pate covers retail businesses for The Denver Post .
