A Different Goal Mario Lemieux has earned the right to put the Olympics ahead of his regular duties // The NHL 's Olympic participation would not be complete without a controversy . Mario Lemieux 's disclosure last week that " my priority this year has been playing in the Olympics , and that 's why I have n't played too many games , especially over the last couple of weeks " was tantamount to telling the league where to get off . All season the NHL has been firm in warning players that their obligations to the league must supersede any consideration of the Olympics  --  for example , commissioner Gary Bettman forbade some players to compete in preliminary-round games that conflicted with their NHL team 's schedule  --  a value system that Lemieux , the Penguins ' captain and owner , undermined , though the league says it does n't see it that way . " Not allowing a group of players to come to this tournament is very different from one player with health issues missing games to prepare himself , " says Bill Daly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's not much difference between Lemieux and other players  --  except that Lemieux is a luminary whom the league does n't dare criticize and , as a team owner , one of Bettman 's bosses . On Oct. 29 he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right hip , and since then he has played sparingly , missing 24 straight games and then competing in 12 of the Penguins ' last 15 before the Olympic break . He performed ineffectually during that stretch . Lemieux missed a Feb. 10 game against the Rangers , whom the Penguins trail by seven points for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot , and watched as Pittsburgh lost 4-3. // Nonetheless , he arrived in Salt Lake City and said he was prepared to play six games in 10 days if Canada were to advance to the gold medal game this Sunday . ( He was held scoreless in Canada 's opening game , a 5-2 loss to Sweden . ) " What can you do ? " Czech Republic center and Penguins teammate Robert Lang says . " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Lemieux also wears the C , a designation with as much currency among NHL foot soldiers as owner , and his prioritizing has sent his team a message that 's not likely to inspire them to make a late-season playoff push . Even so , the outrage of Penguins fans who have peppered Pittsburgh talk-radio shows and newspaper loiters pages with complaints about Lemieux 's Olympic decision is misplaced . Lemieux , 36 , is not only the greatest player in Penguins history , but he also saved the financially strapped franchise from relocating two years ago when he bought it . // Lemieux 's career is a catalog of achievement : two Stanley Cups , three MVP awards , six scoring tides and last season 's spectacular return from retirement . He is , however , without an Olympic medal , and Team Canada , which he also captains , has the talent to win one in Salt Lake City . Lemieux deserves this chance . He is , as he 's made abundantly clear , the rare player who is bigger than the game . // Hurry-up Face-offs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an NHL tactic as time-honored as it is effective , but it could end as early as next season . Prompted by positive results during the Olympics and successful experiments in the AHL and junior hockey , NHL executive vice president Colin Campbell said the chances are good that the league will adopt the so-called hurry-up face-off . // The term is partly a misnomer . It 's more of a hurry-up line change during stoppages in play . This is how it works : The visiting team has five seconds to make a line change , and then the home team has five seconds ( eight in junior leagues ) to send out its players . Once the referee lowers his hand after the line changes , a whistle is blown and the puck is dropped within five seconds . Instead of the delaying tactics that many teams use to rest their players , the face-off ( the NHL is averaging 66 a game this season ) is quickly dispatched . // There 's one exception in the AHL : In the final two minutes of regulation and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NHL is reluctant to see a game decided because a center was slow getting to the circle for a key face-off , it would allow such maneuvering . The length of AHL games has dropped almost 13 minutes this season because of hurry-up face-offs. // NHL players have adapted well to the hurry-up in Salt Lake City , although Steve Yzerman of Team Canada and the Red Wings thinks it 's silly , and Olympic teammate Michael Peca ( Islanders ) worries that defensive-zone draws are too important to be rushed . But Sweden 's Magnus Arvedson ( Senators ) says the hurry-up face-off would enhance NHL play . " It 's tough on the body because the tempo is faster , " Arvedson says , " but once we got used to it , it would make for a better game . " // The hurry-up draw limits time for television replays , but given a positive dry run in the Olympics this is a quick fix that should be implemented .  --  Michael Farber // Olympic Ice Doctor Maintaining a Perfect Surface // Dan Craig 's title at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , he says , " I like it when guys call me Dr. Ice . " Between almost every period , Craig shuffles out in street shoes and fires tiny laser beams onto the ice with a handheld infrared thermometer . " The ice has to be at 21 or 22 degrees , " he says . // Craig works in a similar capacity for the NHL , but the Olympics are especially challenging because he has to maintain good conditions through as many as three games a day at one venue . The arriving and departing crowds cause enough air movement and temperature fluctuation to give an ice guy fits , which is why Craig also carries a device that tells him the temperature of the concrete beneath the ice ( that 's where the cooling pipes are ) and another that gauges the temperature in remote areas of an arena . For instance , he likes to keep the E Center , where the majority of games are being played , at 62 ? when empty and at 67 ? when filled to its 10,100-seat capacity . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to stare humorlessly at the ice . " Actually , I 'm watching the puck , " he says . " I notice every time it skips or takes an odd bounce . I watch a completely different game from most people . "
