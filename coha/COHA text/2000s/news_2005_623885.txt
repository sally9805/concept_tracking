<p> Zadie Smith , by any standards , is extraordinary . At 21 , before she 'd graduated from Cambridge University in England , she signed her first book deal and then watched as her novel , " White Teeth , " became a critical and popular hit around the world . <p> A second novel , " The Autograph Man , " was met with the resentment often accorded sophomore efforts of the terribly young and talented . But her third effort , the effervescent " On Beauty , " is winning reviews that exceed the raves for " White Teeth . " Inspired by E.M . Forster 's " Howards End , " with which it shares plot points , characters and ethical values , it was short-listed for England 's prestigious Man Booker Prize and landed almost instantly on national and Bay Area best-seller lists . <p> Is n't this every young writer 's dream ? No obstacles , no rejection or humiliation or starving for art . Just a near-seamless shift from student to established author . <p> " It was very strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds a tad like that of CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour . " I always feel very fraudulent if young writers ask me what they should do  --  I have no idea . I do n't know who you should send your manuscript to or whether you should do an MFA program . I 'm clueless . " <p> Dressed in brown slacks and blazer , a black turtleneck and African-style head wrap , Smith plays with the ice cubes in her ginger ale as she sits in a hotel lounge area . She 's very shy initially , avoiding eye contact with her interrogator , resting her chin in her palm and nervously covering her mouth with her fingers . <p> Smith , who turns 30 this month , is in the home stretch of a three-week book tour , an exercise she finds absurd  --  " you get tired of listening to yourself "  --  but which , this time at least , was made less onerous by the presence of her husband , British poet Nick Laird . The couple met at Cambridge University when Smith was 18 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't much different from their life as students : " We read and work and watch TV and eat . " <p> Self-effacement is n't a mere facet of personality with Smith , but more of an operating principle  --  a means of survival . Like many artists who achieve tremendous success at an early age , and then shudder as their anonymity slips away like sand beneath a retreating wave , Smith tends to laugh at herself  --  to minimize her creative powers and impact on the cultural landscape . <p> Even after " White Teeth " became a huge hit and was filmed as a " Masterpiece Theatre " miniseries , Smith described it as " the literary equivalent of a hyperactive ginger-haired tap-dancing 10-year-old . " <p> She calls herself a " nerd "  --  one of that isolated , misfit breed that reads voraciously while young , and then continues to identify as an outsider  --  and says that achieving such fortune so quickly and readily was " surreal . " She 's fascinated by the tale , opposite to her own , of Edward P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jones ' novel , his first , was published when he was 53 . Before that he spent 20 years of tedium at Tax Analysts , a Washington , D.C. , nonprofit where he summarized newspaper reports on tax law . <p> " I 'm just moved by the whole concept of him , " Smith says . " Fighting for every piece of education and everything he had , extraordinary adverse circumstances . It 's amazing to me that he wrote a book at all . " <p> When I mention that Jones came across painfully shy and reclusive in an interview two years ago , Smith nods her head in recognition . " There 's a lot of writers like that . " It was n't until she went to college , in fact , that she emerged from a similar shell and enjoyed the company of others . Today , she says , " I think I 'm on the more social side of the natural autism of writers . " <p> The daughter of a black Jamaican mother and white British father  --  they divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green , a racially mixed district of North London . She seems to have had a happy childhood : a house full of books , early infatuations with tap dancing and 1940s Hollywood musicals , a father who read the " Narnia " books to her each night , a nurturing mother who encouraged her interests and career goals , no matter how fanciful or impractical . <p> Reading was her passion and sustenance , and although she dabbled in writing as a kid , creating stories in the styles of P.G . Wodehouse and Agatha Christie , she did n't consider a writing career until she was in college . " I did n't necessarily think , ' I 'll publish books and that will be my job . ' That was kind of inconceivable . " <p> Apart from being a gifted writer  --  funny , insightful and blessed with that Jane Austen acuity that probes beneath a character 's skin to reveal anxieties and defenses  --  Smith is also stunningly beautiful , tall and slender , with high cheekbones , a gorgeous nutmeg complexion and freckles . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have a similar relationship with her looks that she has with her writing . She hates to be photographed , as you can see from her apprehensive gaze in the " On Beauty " dustcover photo , and dresses in a manner that speaks of assistant professor more than glammed-out author . <p> Her modesty , Smith 's defense mechanism , seems to have grown in direct proportion to her achievements . " On Beauty " is a droll , generous saga of campus politics , race and infidelity , hip-hop and art criticism , political correctness and the follies of male menopause . It 's so contemporary in its outlook , so attuned to currents of thought and fashion , that one visualizes its author 's antennae reaching out across the Atlantic , connecting England and America in an uncanny , all-knowing seismography of cultural life . <p> The book took root in Boston , where Smith lived during an 18-month fellowship at Harvard . In place of the Edwardian England of Forster 's " Howards End , " " On Beauty " takes place in contemporary Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fictional Wellington College , lives with his African American wife , Kiki , and their three complicated , opinionated children . <p> Whereas class divisions define conflict in " Howards End , " in " On Beauty " it 's the ideological skirmishes of Bush 's America . Belsey , a philanderer and a buffoon , is a self-righteous leftie who meets his nemesis in Montague Kipps , a pompous Trinidadian archconservative who delights in baiting liberals . <p> Smith does n't take sides ; her ear is so sharp that she captures each man 's rhetoric and doublespeak with equal fidelity . Likewise , a variety of cultural types are easily ventriloquized : Haitian refugees , teenage hip-hoppers , feminist poets and student firebrands enslaved to the dogma of political correctness . Campus satire is one of the book 's delights  --  Smith cites Kingsley Amis ' " Lucky Jim " as a favorite read , and admires Michael Chabon 's " Wonder Boys " and Nabokov 's " Pnin "  --  but she says the college setting is n't essential . <p> " The whole point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess is quite different from how they behave in an intimate setting with their family , friends and wives ... All my books are interested in what constitutes real behavior and what constitutes false behavior . " <p> After three weeks of tooting her horn on tour  --  or , more accurately , feeling abashed by the expectations of tooting her own horn  --  Smith says she 's eager to return to London to see her family . Her father , 80 , is struggling with a recurrence of cancer . Her mother , 52 , a social **29;4470;TOOLONG , lives five minutes from Smith . Younger brother Luke , 22 , was the model for Levi , the teenage hip-hopper in " On Beauty , " and middle child Ben , 27 , is a schoolteacher . <p> The family is close and Smith seems radiantly happy in her marriage to Laird  --  " a really nice guy " who shares his wife 's passion for reading and frequently reads a book simultaneously with her , most recently " Madame Bovary .

" She grins and then , as if to trick the gods who 'd blessed her , she laughs and superstitiously adds , " I 'm sure some terrible thing is about to happen to me to balance it all out .
