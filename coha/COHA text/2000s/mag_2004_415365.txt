I could barely even see the windmill with my naked eyes , but through the 10X glasses , I could finally make out a gray dot moving steadily over the brown and yellow grass . It was a mule deer , and even without seeing the antlers , we knew it was a buck . No doe would ever set out on such a midday march . For 20 minutes , we watched as the buck transformed from a gray dot three miles away into a respectable trophy that entered the pine trees several hundred yards below us . Only after he ducked into the timber did the buck slow down and start nosing around . In those 20 minutes , I received one of the most valuable lessons in mule-deer hunting of my life . CHALLENGES OF OPEN SPACE That buck had traveled at least four miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire seven miles took him less than an hour , and he covered the distance without seeming too concerned about anything in his surroundings . Plains muleys are homeless nomads . Mule deer do n't move back and forth in aimless fashion as whitetails often do . They tend to travel in a line or perhaps a big circle . In the High Plains , mule deer eat grass and sage and browse on the fresh greenery of junipers and other small trees . Many of the native prairie grasses , in particular , are high in protein and are all the deer really need . Everything mule deer walk on is food , and the animals do n't seem to play favorites in what or where they eat . Rarely will mature bucks focus for more than a day or two on a single food source , no matter how attractive it seems to a hunter . Mule deer might feed for a few days in one place but then abandon that food source for three weeksor three months . Their greatest defense in this country ( at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure what to expect when I went bowhunting with Ardrey . He had seen two great bucks entering an alfalfa field to feed on different days in early September , but they disappeared and he had n't seen them again by the time I arrived in early October . As I climbed into a stand near that spot , my hopes were low , but I had a mood swing within several minutes when I watched several bucksthree of them very bigrun into the alfalfa field an hour and a half before sunset . I blinked a few times to clear the cobwebs , but there they were : mule deer chest-deep in the lush green field . A barrel-chested brown-horned buck immediately caught my eye . There were also other big ones , but had I been given the choice , I 'd have taken Ol ' Brownie . I did n't want to risk spooking the bucks by trying a stalk to the edge of the field , but had I known then what I know now , I would have gone for it . I thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day so I could move my stand closer to the trail they used . I was thinking like a whitetail hunter . A PLAN COMES TOGETHER Watching from a distance the next evening , my guide saw the bucks milling back in the cover 150 yards north of my newly moved stand . The following afternoon they came out in the field 400 yards south of me . The fourth evening they came out 250 yards to the south . They were still in the area , but maddeningly unpredictable for a man with a bow . My fifth evening in that stand would be my last . I had to go home at some point , I knew . Shortly after lunch , I went out to shoot my bow , full of nervous energy . I checked the wind a dozen times . Each time the dry brown grass drifted toward the southperfectly wrong for the stand . I decided to try it anyway , hoping for a miracle . The wind brushed the back of my neck for two and a half hours and nothing moved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wind died and the thermals reversed . Not two minutes later , I saw gray forms hustling through the trees and headed for the field . Fortunately , the wind was now cooperating , but unfortunately , the bucks had chosen a trail that was 70 yards away . Minutes after the deer hit the field , I saw my guide begin walking into the field from a quarter mile away . At least one of the big bucks had to be in this group , I thought . I hoped that his antlers were big and brown . As the guide drew closer , he circled slightly into the cover and began to whistle softly as he approached . I expected to see gray streaks at any moment , but instead the soft push worked like a charm . The bucks came my way at a swift walk , the brown-horned buck in the lead . Light was fading fast as I struggled to line my pins up on the dream buck , which stepped into the only shooting lane I could see . When the arrow thumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like I 'd punched a watermelon . I knew it was a solid hit . He kicked up his back hooves and peeled away from the group at a full run . We later found the buck lying dead 125 yards from my stand . This hunt illustrates two important points . First , mule deer are unpredictable . Ardrey had n't seen the bucks for a month , but all of a sudden there they were . Lucky for me that they decided to return while I was there . Second , if my guide had n't been there to move the deer toward me , I never would have gotten a shot . STRATEGIES FOR PLAINS BUCKS A rancher might go on for hours talking about the huge buck he saw three days ago . As a whitetail hunter I want to dash right in there and put up a stand , but I 've learned to resist such temptations when hunting mule deer . Until I actually see the deer and can study the situation carefully , I keep all options open and do n't tie myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the buck where he is right now and then hunt him . Cover a lot of ground , glass known deer hangouts every evening and every morning until you find a buck you want . Assuming you locate him in a place you can hunt , four practical hunting strategies are available : SPOT AND STALK Stalking to within bow range in open terrain is never easy . I 've spent entire days lying behind a sage bush on thinly grassed knobs just 100 yards from a big buck , waiting for him to drift my way . In most cases , he never did . If the buck is alone you 've got a decent chance of slipping in close enough for a shot , but bucks are rarely alone and more than one pair of eyes and ears will be watching and listening for the approach of danger . With a gun , it 's game over for the muley if you 're in reasonable range , but with a bow the stalk approach is generally my second choice . I only try to close the deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambush in the buck 's line of travel . AMBUSH The ambush method is sort of like a stalk-and-wait approach . After spotting a buck in the morning , watch carefully where he beds , get as close as possible to his likely exit route and then wait for him to resume his daily routine . Wherever a buck beds , he is likely to leave going in the same direction he was originally headed . Bucks browse on a variety of natural foods ; there 's usually no reason for them to backtrack . Only when there is a very specific food source nearby or a feature of the terrain that controls movement will the buck possibly leave the bedding cover the way he entered . STILL-HUNT In some parts of the West , where the terrain is dry and crisscrossed with canyons , it 's common for mule deer to bed down in small canyons or in fingers that split off from a main canyon . Sometimes it 's possible for a bowhunter to slowly and silently still-hunt such a canyon and scan the terrain ahead in hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of trying to get in position for a shot before he detects you . SOFT PUSHES I 've taken mule deer ( and big whitetails too ) with my bow on the plains by resorting to soft pushes . Keep the effort subtle . Ask a companion to get the deer standing ( but not to drive them ) as you wait nearby and hope for the best . Sometimes it works , but usually it does n't . This is the strategy of last resort , once you 've determined that nothing else will work and you 're desperate . Mule deer of the High Plains have a unique behavior and offer a thrilling challenge that makes them nearly irresistible . I love to hunt whitetails , but going one-on-one with a plains monster gives me a rush that few whitetail hunts can match . It is one of bowhunting 's ultimate thrills . Spot-and-Stalk Tips 1 . Hunt in pairs whenever possible . Two sets of eyes will see more game , and when you spot a trophy buck , one hunter can stay back to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalk starts to get dicey in the final approach and the muley looks nervous , be patient . Wait until things calm down before proceeding . 3 . If you 're hunting for a trophy , carry a compact spotting scope and a tripod . Long-range field judging will allow you to use your hunting time more efficiently . 4 . Use grass clippings to test the wind regularly . Account for the effects of thermal currents when hunting hilly terrain . Approach bucks from uphill in the morning when thermals are rising . 5 . Stalks should always start fast and end slow . Get within 100 yards as quickly as you can and then slow down . Walk Softly On the Plains My favorite footwear for stalking mule deer over the crunchy plains is a pair of inexpensive Chucks-Converse All-Star high-top basketball shoes . For hunters who are more particular , Cabela 's offers a similar design in camouflage called the Silent Stalk Sneaker. ( www.cabelas.com ) If you are stalking in areas where a carpet of small stones makes footing even noisier , remove your boots for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool socks . You can also put on a pair of noise-muffling thick-pile stalking booties over thin boots or shoes . Examples include Cabela 's Baer 's Feet or Sneeky Pete Feet from PSE. ( www.pse-archery.com ) Silence is crucial during a stalk . If your boots have hard soles , consider using a pair of noise-muffling stalking booties . QUICK FIXES Bug Stopper To ward off flies and other insects , spray the body cavity of a deer or other field-dressed big game with a mixture of lemon juice concentrate ( 60 percent ) and Tabasco sauce ( 40 percent ) . Illustration <p>                     @x Deputy Sheriff Brian Sleuter was looking for a better country/ western station when the Toyota flew by , spraying a few roadside pebbles against the front bumper of his cruiser . " Jesus Christ , Bud , " he said softly , turning on his headlights , putting the car into gear , and hitting his blue lights  --  all in a single , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the bird while you 're at it ? " He fishtailed into the road from his hiding place , his rear tires spinning before gaining purchase , and took off down Vermont Route 7 with a burst from the Impala 's built- up engine , the Toyota 's rear lights already fading fast into the late- night summer darkness . This stretch of road  --  straight , isolated , and well paved  --  was a magnet for speeders . It was long after midnight , and Sleuter had been waiting patiently for just such an opportunity . In the split second that his well- trained eye had glimpsed the interior of the car , illuminated only by its own dash lights , he 'd caught sight of two people , both young males . That , chapter one combined with the Toyota being older , dark- colored , and nondescript in appearance  --  and that it was headed south from the direction of Burlington and possibly Canada  --  helped him think he might be about to tag his first drug runner in five weeks.That had been way too long for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleuter . He saw himself as a man on the make , and the faster that he created a name for himself , the sooner he could move up to some outfit like ATF or DEA where he couldreally throw the book at the bad guys . The Toyota grew in size before him as he pushed the accelerator to the floor . Official police denials notwithstanding , high- speed rundowns had their thrills . The engine 's unleashed roar , the sudden blurring of scenery on both sides , pulsing to the strobe bar 's steady beat , heightened the defiant , indomitable sense of superiority that washed through Sleuter every time he put on his uniform . He 'd been told that was n't a good thing  --  that it ran counter to the whole professional , courteous , protect- and- serve bullshit the boss spouted at monthly trainings  --  but he knew what he knew , which was that a gun and a badge made for a good argument in a fight , and that he had no interest in being a social worker . Call him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least he was no loser.The Toyota began slowing down , pulling over to the side of the narrow road . Ahead of them both , a pair of headlights crested a distant hill , aiming their way . Sleuter instinctively charted their progress , as he was simultaneously watching for any suspicious activity from the Toyota , but all the on- comer did was slow as they always did upon sight of the blue lights , before sliding by timidly as Sleuter angled his cruiser to a stop behind his quarry . He hit the spotlight switch by his left window , freezing the car before him in a blinding halo , and removed the radio mike from its cradle . " Fifty-one  --  Dispatch . " " Fifty-one . This is Dispatch . " " I 'm Seventy-five Massachusetts passenger Romeo Foxtrot Zulu , Three Eight One , a mile or two north of the Route 17 crossroad on Route 7 . " " Ten-Four , Fifty-one . " At least Dispatch was on the ball , Sleuter thought as he opened his door , not shooting the shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced at the camera screen glowing high and near the center of his windshield , to make sure the icon representing his body recorder was on . He was n't a huge believer in high-tech gadgets  --  he hated computers , for example  --  but he 'd won more than one case in court because of voice and image recordings . He emerged from his car and paused , studying what he could see of the two men caught in the harsh glare . Unfortunately , that only amounted to the backs of their heads . He needed to know what their hands were doing . He circled around to the rear of the cruiser , keeping out of his own lights , and closed in on the Toyota from its right side , thereby avoiding being seen in the driver 's outside left mirror  --  the place most operators checked to monitor an officer 's approach . When he came even with the car 's right-rear bumper , knowing he 'd entered the cruiser 's camera frame , Sleuter did one more thing out of long habit : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal of the vehicle . This strict official protocol , a gesture born of painful past experience , reflected how many times cops had been shot and/or killed during a stop , and their evidentiary fingerprints later found on the suspect 's car . Each time Sleuter touched a vehicle this way , he did so consciously , as aware of the bet he was hedging as when he donned his ballistic vest before every shift . He stopped again to scrutinize what he could see of the interior of the car , and to add to the discomfort of its occupants . He also glanced around quickly . There were n't any trees along this stretch  --  it was open , rolling countryside , cupped between the Green Mountains to the east , and the Adirondacks across Lake Champlain to the west . At night , that made it overwhelmingly black and vast and helped make Brian Sleuter feel like the most exposed object for miles around . Returning to the task at hand , and secure that he 'd seen no obvious signs of danger from inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suspicious posture or movement , he turned on his small , powerful handlight and shined it directly into the car , starting with its rear seat . Again , he saw nothing untoward . Both heads swiveled in his direction as he walked up to the passenger window and tapped on it with his light , standing even with the back door to make of himself a harder target . The window whirred down . " Hey , there , officer , " the driver spoke across the chest of his companion , who merely stared ahead after the briefest glimpse in Sleuter 's direction  --  an immobility Brian found telling . " Evening , " he answered . " I 'd like to see your driver 's license , registration , and proof of insurance . " The driver , a young man with a mustache and a silver post twinkling in the nest of his left eyebrow , smiled and nodded . " Sure thing , officer . " He reached over and opened the glove box before the Sphinx-like passenger . Sleuter followed the man 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment of documents and food wrappers , eventually finding a wrinkled envelope and pulling it out . The driver extracted the requested paperwork and handed it over . Sleuter glanced at the Massachusetts license he held in his left hand , having wedged his light under his left armpit  --  thereby keeping his gun hand free at all times . " This your current address , Mr. Marano ? " " Nah . I moved . The right one 's on the registration . I 'm still getting the license changed . " Sleuter nudged the passenger on the shoulder . " How ' bout you ? You got any identification ? " The passenger finally looked up at him fully , his expression tense . " I did n't do nuthin ' . " " Did n't say you did . Got any identification ? " The man hesitated . He , too , was young , like the driver , but sported a goatee and no piercings that Sleuter could see . He did , however , have the edge of a tattoo poking just over the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was also sweating , which Sleuter found noteworthy . It was summer , fair enough , but that did n't have the same meaning up here as it did farther south  --  the nights generally ran cool , just like now . " Sure . No problem , " the man said and reached for his back pocket , lifting himself off the seat in the process . Sleuter stepped back , watching them carefully . Every nerve in his body told him he had something cooking here , people with criminal records at least , and probably more . He took the other man 's driver 's license when it was handed to him and repeated his earlier question : " You still at this address , Mr.  --  " he paused to read , " Grega ? " " Sure , " Grega answered , once more looking straight ahead . Sleuter paused a moment , considering his approach . What he was hoping for was a consent search . What he knew he should request was backup . But he was reluctant to pursue that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want to share the credit . " What happens when I run you two through the computer ? " he asked . " I gon na find anything ? " " Not me , officer , " Marano said with his quick smile . " You can check all you want . " " Yeah , " Grega answered more ambivalently . " Check all you want . " Sleuter nodded , mostly to himself . Those were pretty standard responses . And did n't mean much . People either thought that out-of-state records did n't cross the border , or that Vermont cops were too dumb to even operate a computer . Or both . " Okay , " he told them . " Stay put . I 'll be right back . " " Take your time , officer , " said Marano , his courtesy tinged with contempt . Sleuter backed away , keeping his eye on the car as he went , not fully turning away until he felt he was safe . As before , he circled the rear of his cruiser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects the slightest flash of his silhouette . " Fifty- one  --  Dispatch , " he radioed after closing his door behind him . " Dispatch . " " You have a twenty-eight ? Twenty-seven , RO . " Dispatch gave him the registration first , as requested . " Massachusetts passenger Romeo Foxtrot Zulu , Three Eight One , is a 2004 , two-door Toyota Solara , color black , registered to James Marano and valid until 2009 . " She gave him the address in Boston , on Dorchester Avenue  --  nicknamed " Dot Ave " among cops , and infamous as a drug and gang hotbed . It matched what appeared on Marano 's registration . " The twenty- seven , " she continued in the same flat voice , referring to the registered owner 's  --  or " RO 's "  --  operator 's license , " is valid in Massachusetts . No priors in Vermont . " That was the first layer , and usually the most useless . Sleuter opened his mouth to ask her to dig deeper when he simultaneously noticed two things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Toyota was no longer visible , and there was a sudden movement to his left . But that was all . The bullet entering his temple put an end to everything else . Excerpted from The Catch by Archer Mayor.Copyright 2008 by Archer Mayor.Published in October 2008
