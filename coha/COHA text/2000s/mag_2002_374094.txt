Carly Fiorina has long struck a tone of defiant self-assurance , and it 's beginning to seem justified . The CEO of tech giant Hewlett-Packard proved adept at playing Wall Street hardball , leading her company 's ferociously contested proxy battle to buy Compaq Computer for $19 billion . She promised big benefits from that acquisition and last week began to deliver them . HP 's quarterly earnings report showed the company stemming losses in its most troubled divisions  --  PCs and corporate computer systems  --  and surpassing its cost-cutting goals . HP shares have surged 72% since early October , including 15% last week . <P> Fiorina has quieted some of those she calls her " cynics and doubters , " who had whispered that a woman with a marketing background was not fit to run HP . But she still faces formidable challenges , starting with generating profits in PCs and corporate " enterprise systems " at her newly merged company , which posted $35 billion in revenues in its first six months . Can she go from being a Churchillian leader , adept at giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being more of a Lou Gerstner , IBM 's former CEO , who was able not only to slash costs and jettison unpromising lines of business but also to steer the company toward new prospects and profits ? <P> Since HP 's president , Michael Capellas , a respected operations manager and Compaq 's last CEO , quit to run WorldCom in mid-November , Fiorina must now take full responsibility for HP 's bottom line at a time when she must parry new threats from IBM and Dell . Both have spent the past year bulking up major parts of their businesses , while HP has been on a low-cal diet , trying to restore its flabby enterprises to health . As analyst Bill Shope of J.P . Morgan Chase puts it , " IBM is trying to squeeze HP at the upper end of the market , while Dell is challenging it at the lower end . HP has carved a spot in the middle , but it 's not clear if that 's where it should be . " <P> Fiorina 's supporters think HP in the middle will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not changed , they argue . By buying Compaq 's vast product portfolio , R.-and-D. muscle , direct-sales channel and 34,000 tech-service pros , HP could thwart IBM and Dell . " Analysts are waiting for us to put points on the scoreboard , " says Michael Winkler , Fiorina 's executive vice president for operations . ( Fiorina declined to be interviewed . ) <P> In terms of cost cutting , those points are accumulating . HP has shuttered nine assembly plants , cut 12,500 jobs and " rationalized " its product offerings , reducing them to 65,000 from 85,000 . Result : $650 million in savings since the merger , which helped HP offset losses in its divisions that make PCs and enterprise-computing gear . " I 'm keeping my shares , " says Ben Rosen , Compaq 's former chairman and a large shareholder . " HP is going to get so lean that earnings surprises will be on the upside. "
