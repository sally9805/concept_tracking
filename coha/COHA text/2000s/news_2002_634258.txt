<p> The great Jose Canseco was down to this : trying out for , and getting cut by , major-league teams . Did he then leave gracefully ? No . He played in the minors , hitting .172 for Charlotte , the White Sox ' Class AAA team , desperate for a few more major-league at-bats . Finally , mercifully , he retired Monday . <p> The next day , Cubs first baseman Fred McGriff was benched . The great McGriff is down to this : hitting around .210 , getting booed and having fans outwardly question whether he 's trying . <p> The magic number is 500 . No one who has hit that many home runs in his career has failed to make the Hall of Fame . <p> But Canseco and McGriff , aging stars just short of 500 homers , have raised questions about how magical that number truly is . <p> Does it really help to step on your own legend to reach the mountaintop ? And in the modern age of tiny parks dominated by inflated players with inflated home-run totals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McGriff will be two of the test cases for the future of the Hall of Fame . <p> " I would n't put Canseco in , " baseball historian Bill James said . " He was so good as a young player , but the second half of his career , he was just kind of wandering around , bouncing from team to team with baseballs bouncing on his head and out of the park . He did n't seem to have any follow-up . " <p> And McGriff ? <p> " In 1995 , I was asked to do a children 's book on the top 10 home-run hitters of all time , " said historian Bill Deane , a former senior research associate at the Hall of Fame . " They asked me to pick two current players . One of the guys I picked was Fred McGriff . <p> " He had hit 30 home runs seven years in a row back when people were n't doing that . He was on the fast track to the Hall . But then everyone else started hitting homers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick . " <p> Canseco and McGriff are the definition of borderline Hall of Famers . Canseco , 37 , finished with 462 homers , two World Series rings and a Most Valuable Player Award . He was the first player to hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same year . Early in his career , he was the league 's dominant player ; in the middle , he was an injured journeyman ; at the end , he was a hanger-on . <p> McGriff , 38 , was the model of consistency . For the first half of his career , he hit more homers than almost anyone . But in the second half , as baseball moved into the home-run era , McGriff 's consistent numbers seem less impressive . Going into the Cubs ' game Wednesday night in St. Louis , he had 451 homers . This is his first truly ugly season , but to reach 500 , he might have to play two or three more years . <p> " They probably would have been borderline 10 years ago , " Deane said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach those numbers , they might not even be borderline anymore . Someday , someone with 500 is n't going to make it . Instead of having 15 guys hitting 500 homers , someday it 's going to be 50 or 60 guys , and they 're not all going to get in . <p> " What might happen with Canseco and McGriff is that they will get one level of support , but when they are joined on the ballot by all these other guys who now are hitting more home runs , they might drop down . Canseco is going to be on the ballot with Mark McGwire , Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn . " <p> James agreed : " I 'd say McGriff is probably a stronger candidate than Canseco . But it 's certainly possible that 500 home runs will cease to be an automatic standard . " <p> Players are eligible for Hall of Fame consideration five years after they retire . Baseball writers vote to decide who makes it . Magic numbers serve only as guides . <p> The new era is hurting Canseco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems less impressive but still magical today , then how will it look in five years when Canseco and McGriff are on the ballot ? <p> Steve Hirdt , executive vice president of the Elias Sports Bureau , baseball 's official statisticians , said players should not be judged by magic numbers . Numbers mean different things in different eras . He said players should be judged by how they did within their era . <p> " And these two guys should not be judged for the modern era , " Hirdt said . " They were considered stars before everyone started hitting home runs . They did n't really play the bulk of their careers in the offensive era . " <p> Asked what he thought of their chances of being voted in , Hirdt said he leaned against Canseco . Then he stopped himself . <p> " Canseco was a great player who had great speed , " he said . " But the second part of his career has almost become trivialized or cartoon-ized . That 's because of the video clip of him pitching , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence . <p> " He has left our vision of how good he was as a very distant vision . But that 's why there 's a five-year waiting period before eligibility . It gives perspective to a career , so the minute of his retirement we do n't stand up and give thumbs up or thumbs down . " <p> Tracy Ringolsby , the baseball writer for the Rocky Mountain News and a Hall of Fame voter , agreed that by the time Canseco and McGriff are on the ballot , this era might be fully evaluated . But it might have changed , too . <p> He pointed out that home-run numbers are down this year , and several good , young pitchers are coming up . It might be , he said , that the power era is on the way out . Or maybe not . <p> In five years , Ringolsby said , the magic number might be 550 home runs . Instead of 300 victories  --  a starting pitcher 's magic number  --  it might be 270 . Or maybe the old numbers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGriff will not get in the Hall . Baseball writers , he said , do n't adjust well to changing eras . He said relief pitchers still seem to be only barely accepted by voters . And Canseco , along with former Sox player Harold Baines , will bring in a whole new issue : <p> How will voters look at players who spent much of their time as designated hitters ? <p> " They 're basically pinch hitters four times a game , " Ringolsby said . " You wonder what numbers other players in the past might have put up if they had been able to hang around five more years as a DH . Over time we start to accept things and deal with things , but I do n't know about that first group of DHs . <p> " The psyche of what gets people to vote the way they do always interests me . " <p> For example , Ringolsby said he has a hard time voting for someone such as Kirby Puckett , a great player who was forced to retire at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , Ringolsby believes many voters project what the career numbers would have been had the players stayed longer . <p> But projections tend to be higher than reality , as shown by Dale Murphy and Gary Carter , two top players who did continue to play past their primes . <p> " Look at Kirby Puckett and Don Mattingly , " James said . " They have similar numbers , but Kirby left on top and got right in . " <p> That might be a problem for former Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg , who retired at the top of his game and was considered a potential first-ballot selection . Then he came back and played two seasons below his standard . <p> " And I do n't think he 's a shoo-in , " Deane said . " His comeback hurt his chances . " <p> That 's what Canseco and McGriff apparently have risked by not leaving on time . So which is better ? Ending a strong career on a high note but short of magic numbers ? Or reaching those numbers by tacking ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitting .210 but gets to 500 , " James said , " it might hurt him as much as it helps . "
