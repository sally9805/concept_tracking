1 " Are you sure you 're going to be all right now ? " " I 'll be fine , Grandma . " " I hate to go off and leave you . " Lily rolls her eyes . " Grandma , I 'm seventeen years old , I can take care of myself for two days . " " Of course you can , dear . It 's just ... " No need to complete the sentence  --  they both know how it ends . " Dody , she 'll be fine , " chimes in Lily 's grandfather . " Now can we please get this show on the road  --  I want to be off the highway before dark . " His night vision is n't what it used to be  --  but then , as he 's fond of saying , what is ? In the circular driveway at the bottom of the wide marble steps waits a gleaming black Mercedes SUV loaded with enough provisions to have seen Napoleon 's army safely home from Moscow . Dark-haired , dark-eyed Lily hugs her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When her grandfather stoops to give Lily a peck on the cheek , the overpowering scent of his aftershave brings tears to her eyes  --  apparently his sense of smell ai n't what it used to be , either . Lily waves from the top of the steps until the SUV is out of sight , then heads back inside the two-story , Mission-style Pebble Beach mansion where she 's lived with hergrandparents since she was almost five . To celebrate being alone , she sneaks up to her grandmother 's bedroom , steals a cigarette from the pack of Dorals Grandma hides in a bureau drawer , and smokes it out on the balcony , waving it around languidly , wrist bent like some old movie actress . But the reality of being home alone never lives up to the expectation for long . After a few puffs the cigarette tastes hot and stale , and when she stubs it out and goes back inside , the mansion is so empty and echoey that she can hear the tick-tock of the grandfather clock down in the parlor from her second-floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television and clicks through the channels . MTV is showing one of its beach parties , college kids dancing on the sand , the boys in their baggy shorts and scraggly wanna-be goatees , the heavy-breasted girls in skimpy bikinis that barely cover their nipples . Lily is both disturbed and fascinated by the overt sexuality . Scaredy cat , she chides herself  --  do n't you even want a normal life someday ? Just to see what it would feel like , she strips down to her bra and panties , tries on a few moves in front of the floor-length mirror mounted on the closet door . Oh yeah , she thinks happily , blushing like a pomegranate at sunset , I could do this . But after only a few seconds of modest abandon , an image from Lily 's past fills her mind . Strong , sharp-scented male hands , large enough to palm her head like a softball , pry her jaws apart ; an impossibly swollen , purple-headed penis forces itself into her mouth , choking her ; a flashbulb explodes into white glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath as if she were still that baby , and sits on the edge of the bed , head between her knees , breathing iiiin and ouuut , niiice and caaalm . A commercial for acne cream is playing ; she feels around for the remote and blindly switches off the television , then guides herself through an exercise she 's learned from her psychiatrist , Dr. Irene Cogan . That was then , this  --  she raises her head , glances around the familiar bedroom  --  is now . That was a memory , this is the reality . You 're not that helpless baby anymore  --  no one can touch you without your consent . And gradually the panic subsides . Lily turns on the bedroom light , slips on a bathrobe and a pair of slippers , and is halfway down the wide , curving staircase when the phone starts ringing . She charges back up the stairs , throws herself across the bed , fumbles the receiver off the hook just before the downstairs answering machine kicks in . " Hello ? " " Is this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's calling , please ? " Lily is well-versed in telephone safety . " This is Sergeant Mapes , California Highway Patrol . " Everything 's gone quiet , like just before an earthquake . " Yes , this is the DeVries residence . " " Who am I speaking to ? " " This is Lily . Lily DeVries  --  I 'm their granddaughter . Is something wrong ? " " Is there an adult around I can speak to ? " " Yes  --  me . " It is n't the first time Lily has been mistaken for a child over the phone . " Has something happened to them ? " " There 's been an accident . A bad one . " A pause . " A very bad one . " Another pause , as if he wanted Lily to ask him a question . She could n't think of one , though  --  all she could think of was how tired she had suddenly become . " I 'm sorry to have to be the one to break the news , Miss DeVries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather seems to have lost control of the vehicle on Highway One , a few miles south of Big Sur . It went through the guardrail , over the cliff , and landed on the rocks sixty feet below . Both bodies were still in the car . If it 's any comfort , they were almost certainly killed outright . " Lily had to put the receiver under her pillow to muffle the squeaky , unintelligible sounds coming out of it . Too tired , she thought , rolling onto her stomach and closing her eyes  --  I 'm too tired to deal with this .
