For someone who lunges to glory swathed in a get-up resembling a bee-keeper 's outfit , French fencer Laura Flessel-Colovic has had no problem establishing herself as one of France 's most chic and photogenic sports personalities . Since first grabbing attention with a pair of gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics , she has wowed sports fans with graceful and tenacious swordswomanship , adding three world championship titles to a list of international laurels . Away from her foils , the stunning 28-year-old has enhanced her celebrity status with flourishes of wit and charm that have made her a star with a larger French public that does n't know an epee from its elbow . <P> " What I do n't want people forgetting is that I 'm first and foremost a fencer , " stresses Flessel-Colovic , whose wedding in 1996 to a French journalist generated wider media coverage than most of her competitions enjoy . " After all , if people know who I am at all , it 's thanks to my sport . All the rest  --  the attention , the fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guadeloupe to the summit of the fencing world was an unrelenting drive and competitive ferocity that early on earned her the sobriquet la Guepe  --  the Wasp . Flessel-Colovic latched onto fencing at age seven after seeing French legend Jean-Francois Lamour on television . She abandoned dance lessons for the local fencing club  --  and soon began a victorious ascent through local and regional ranks . The promising southpaw did n't leave home for Paris , and intensive training , until 1990 , when  --  at 19 , far from family , friends and acquaintances  --  she fought off loneliness by pouring all her attention and time into fencing . <P> Her focus and hunger to win paid swift dividends , as she won the Pan American championships in 1991 , 1992 and 1994 and finished third in the 1995 world championships in her event , the epee . ( Fencing has three events with slightly different blades and rules . In epee , you score by jabbing your opponent anywhere with the point of the weapon ; in foil , you score only by touching point to torso ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade but only above the waist . ) The following year in Atlanta she won the gold in the inaugural epee category  --  and another gold with the French team  --  and followed that up with a trio of world titles in 1998 and 1999 . <P> Flessel-Colovic 's fencing successes turned her into a sports-page heroine . As a black woman from the Caribbean excelling in a sport usually associated with white European men , she joined the high-profile members of France 's world and European champion soccer team as a positive icon of the country 's changing , multiethnic face . <P> Flessel-Colovic points out that unlike soccer , " fencing does n't feed you "  --  a fact that obliges her to juggle a career promoting business travel for Paris ' office of tourism . She welcomes the work obligations because they help her budget her time better and remain focused on the task  --  or combat  --  before her . In Sydney , Flessel-Colovic will need to turn her attention to Hungary 's Ildiko Mincza and Italy 's Cristina Cascioli , her probable rivals for the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
