The anthropic approach to cosmology asks , What makes the universe compatible with intelligent life ? Was it just the luck of the draw ? // Cogito ergo sum , " wrote Ren Descartes in 1641 : " I think , therefore I am . " Anyone who has a thought , in other words , must actually exist-quite a relief for those who had their doubts . Three and a half centuries later scientists and philosophers are investigating an intriguing , related question that Descartes passed over : Sum ergo ... ? What conclusions , if any , can be drawn from the fact that we do exist ? Attempts to answer that question have given increased support to a line of thought that scientists and philosophers have termed the " anthropic principle , " the idea that the simple fact of our existence offers fundamental insights and information about the entire universe . First named in 1973 by the cosmologist Brandon Carter , now at the Paris Observatory in Meudon , France , the anthropic principle can be better described as the " anthropic approach " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deduced from the fact that we are here . ( To emphasize that the " we " in question could be any form of intelligent life , some prefer the term " biophilic life-loving principle " to the terms " anthropic principle " or " anthropic approach . " ) The anthropic principle rests on the assumption-maintained by almost all physicists and cosmologists-that a single set of physical laws holds true throughout the universe . All of modern cosmology , including the theory of the expanding universe , rests on that assumption . The principle itself has at least two forms . One , called the weak anthropic principle , notes that for us to exist and thus to observe the universe , the values of the parameters that describe the cosmos must be consistent with the fact that we have evolved within the universe . The second version , called the strong anthropic principle , requires that the basic parameters describing the cosmos-the strengths of fundamental forces , for instance-cannot have random values , but instead must have values that enable life to develop at some stage in cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did not allow the possibility of life . What can either or both of these versions add to science ? Some scientists find them no more than a tautology : We 're here because we 're here . Certainly from a biological viewpoint , the fact that so many possible sites for life exist in the cosmos , and the fact that life as we know it thrives in a range of environments , suggest at most a weak connection between cosmic conditions and the evolution of life on Earth . The story of life on Earth is the story of how life has evolved to be fit for our planet . The biologist Paul P. Ehrlich of Stanford University makes the same point for the universe in general : " To say that " the universe is fit for life , " " he writes , " has things exactly backward : We are fit for the universe , not the other way around . Had things been different , we would have evolved differently . " Yet some scientists-though certainly not allare convinced that the anthropic principle has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , about the universe as a whole-once again , assuming that the same laws of physics hold sway throughout its extent-suggest that the physical parameters of our universe do not have random values . Until recently , the " cosmic coincidences " most frequently cited as being favorable to life included the following three items : * The development of structure in the universe during its first billion years gave rise to galaxy clusters and to individual galaxies made up of hundreds of billions of stars . That process depended critically on minute deviations from a. totally smooth distribution of matter at the time clumps of matter could first form , about 380,000 years after the big bang . If those deviations had been a trifle smaller , galaxies would never have formed as the universe expanded ; if they had been a bit larger , almost all the matter in the universe would have ended up in supermassive black holes . * The strong nuclear force holds protons and neutrons together . If that force were more than 2 percent stronger than its actual value , protons would bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of matter that does not occur in the universe we inhabit . In that case , nuclear fusion during the first few minutes after the big bang would have left nearly all the protons in the universe bound up in di-proton nuclei . Those nuclei would have quickly become deuterium nuclei ( each made up of one proton and one neutron ) as one of the two fused protons turned into a neutron . The deuterium nuclei would then have rapidly paired off and fused to form helium nuclei , each made up of two protons and two neutrons . As a result , most of the ordinary matter in the universe would have become helium , not hydrogen . In our universe , about a quarter of the ordinary matter did end up in helium , but almost all the rest remained in the form of protons ( hydrogen nuclei ) . A helium-dominated universe could never have given birth to stars that generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium . Nor could it have produced water , the solvent that many scientists think is essential to life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars happens to include those suitable for creating carbon nuclei . Each nucleus of carbon 's primary isotope includes six protons and six neutrons . At the high temperatures inside aging stars , two helium nuclei can move toward each other fast enough to overcome the mutual repulsion of their positive electric charges . If the nuclei collide , they become bound together by the strong nuclear force and fuse , creating a nucleus of beryllium , which has four protons and four neutrons . Simple arithmetic suggests that one more helium nucleus could then fuse with the beryllium to make carbon ( four protons plus two make six ) . The beryllium nucleus is unstable , however , and seems far more likely to decay rapidly than to fuse with another helium nucleus . Since carbon is in fact abundant , the fusion must actually prevail , but why ? In 1954 the English cosmologist Fred Hoyle argued that the existence of large numbers of carbon nuclei in the universe implies a serendipitous property of the carbon nucleus . Specifically , Hoyle argued , a carbon nucleus must be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely matches the energy of the nucleus formed when a helium nucleus collides with a beryllium nucleus at the temperatures ( and therefore the impact speeds ) common within aging stars . The energy of the collision produces carbon nuclei in a " resonant state , " some of which can shed excess energy to yield a stable form of carbon . Soon after Hoyle s prediction , nuclear scientists discovered that carbon does indeed possess such a resonant state . Because carbon is the basic structural element that enables complex molecules to form in virtually infinite variety , a universe without carbon might well be a universe without life . None of these three coincidences can be regarded as definitive for concluding that the parameters of the universe are not random . But taken together , they seem to confirm the idea of a " Goldilocks " universe : the conclusion that the universe must be " just right " for complex forms of life to appear . Other examples of cosmic " fine tuning " exist , but until recently none of them seemed to add much to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmological constant . The cosmological constant was first introduced by Einstein into the equations he created in 1917 to describe the overall evolution of the cosmos . The constant describes-to use todays terminologythe amount of " dark energy " that resides in each cubic centimeter of apparently empty space see " Gravity in Reverse , " by Neil deGrasse Tyson , December 2003/January 2004 . Dark energy , an invisible kind of energy , tends to make the universe expand , so its effects become more pronounced with time . As the cosmos expands , more space is born , with its own additional dark energy . The newly created dark energy makes the universe expand even more rapidly , which in turn gives birth to still more dark energy , . . . and so on . What the future holds in that scenario , for a time so distant that almost all the stars will have burnt themselves out , is a universe in a state of runaway expansion , a cosmos so vast that the matter in it will be entirely insignificant . No observational evidence favored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , the lack of evidence led Einstein to regard his introduction of the cosmological constant as the " greatest blunder " of his scientific life . Hence most cosmologists tended to assume that the constant must be zero ; dark energy , they agreed , does not exist . In 1998 , however , astronomers announced that their observations of supernova explosions in far-off galaxies show that the expansion of the universe is actually accelerating . The acceleration implies not only that dark energy exists , but also that it exists in such quantities that , if measured by its mass equivalent , it dominates all the rest of the matter and energy in the universe by a ratio of almost three to one . And the domination of dark energy will only increase as time passes . But why does the cosmological constant have the value that now characterizes the universe ? Cosmologists may know some day , but for now , as the physicist Thomas Banks of the University of California , Santa Cruz , and Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey , has written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding problem of theoretical physics . " A relatively straightforward calculation does yield a theoretical value for the cosmological constant , but that value is greater than the measured one by a factor of about 10(120)-probably the largest discrepancy between theory and observation science has ever had to bear . If the cosmological constant had a smaller value than that suggested by recent observations , it would cause no trouble ( just as one would expect , remembering the happy days when the constant was thought to be zero ) . But if the constant were a few times larger than it is now , the universe would have expanded so rapidly that galaxies could not have endured for the billions of years necessary to bring forth complex forms of life . What makes this result particularly relevant to the anthropic principle , besides adding one more parameter to the list of " cosmic coincidences " ? Its significance lies in promoting the concept of the " multiverse , " an idea that has been dear to cosmologists ' hearts for several decades-perhaps because it boggles the mind so thoroughly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from disbelief , or possibly both . The concept suggests that what people usually call the universe , traditionally defined as everything that exists , actually amounts to just one of an infinite number of universes . Taken together , these multiple universes constitute an infinitely larger multiverse ( sometimes called the metauniverse ) . You might think that some of the universes would run into each other , like cosmic bumper cars , but the theorists who created the concept assure us that such things can not happen . The anthropic approach fits together well with the concept of the multiverse . Multiverse cosmology suggests that each of the many universes comes into existence with its own , randomly generated parameters and laws that govern the motions and interactions of space and matter . Many such universes , for instance , would be born with a cosmological constant so large that each of them would quickly expand into emptiness , leaving no chance for galaxies or stars to form . Still other universes might resemble our own cosmos more closely , but have strong forces so much stronger than ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we do live in a multiverse , it should surprise no one that we find ourselves in a particular universe that enables us to exist-one in which the laws of nature provide world enough and time for intelligent life to evolve . The multiverse approach seems to reduce the strong anthropic principle to the assertion that at least one of these universes had to be born with conditions that would allow life to exist . The multiverse concept does not , of course , arise from , or depend on , the fact that the cosmological constant has turned out not be zero . But the recently discovered non-zero value does provide special impetus to the idea of a universe within a multiverse . Many theorists already suspect that even the finest minds on the planet may find no other way to explain that value . Explaining the strength of the strong nuclear force , or the fact that carbon nuclei have a resonant state that enables them to form readily in stars , may require " no more " than a subtler application of the basic laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmological constant , but so far all efforts have proved fruitless . Some have concluded that the anthropic approach to a multiverse has the best chance of providing a satisfactory answer . Satisfaction , of course , remains in the mind of the beholder . Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the anthropic approach is its ability to provoke strong opinions and controversy , not only among the public , but also-even more soamong cosmologists . A sampling among the latter shows that opinions run across a broad spectrum . Unsurprisingly , the anthropic approach gets its most favorable reception among those who seek to explain the laws of nature in terms of " intelligent design " : as the work of a creator whose goals included bringing forth life on Earth . But no one of that persuasion needs a multiverse , and the chief remaining issue becomes one of wondering why such a wild and wacky universe was needed to bring forth life on a single planet . Virtually no scientists , however , are drawn to explanations that presuppose intelligent design , because all of science is motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie beyond the human ability to understand them . Among the cosmologists who reject the intelligent-design approach but do favor the anthropic principle , probably the best known is the cosmologist Martin J. Rees of the University of Cambridge . Rees emphasizes that we have already adopted an anthropic approach toward explaining some aspects of our existence . The size of the Earth 's orbit around the sun , for instance , which plays a crucial role in the existence of life on our planet , does not follow from any physical law : it just is what it is . According to Rees , then , science must simply decide which cosmic questions can be answered without appealing to an anthropic principle , and which must , by default , be resolved by the anthropic approach . A sizable group of cosmologists find Rees 's attitude a bit too easygoing . Though not actually disgruntled about the anthropic principle , they are , nonetheless , in P. G. Wodehouse 's phrase , far from being gruntled with it . The most prominent of the middlegrounders , the physicist Steven Weinberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anthropic principle as a disappointing last resort , provoked by the failure to find a better explanation for the value of the cosmological constant . As Weinberg writes in his book Facing Up : I would personally be much happier if we could precisely calculate the values of all the fundamental constants of nature on the basis of fundamental principles , rather than having to think about what values are favorable to life . But nature cares little about what physicists prefer . A third group of experts comprises those who despise the anthropic principle . The cosmologist Michael S. Turner of the National Science Foundation describes the anthropic approach as " narcissistic " and a " principle of last resort . " " Set your goals high , " he urges , " and try to solve cosmic puzzles on the basis of physics . " The physicist David Gross of the University of California , Santa Barbara , notes that " science has managed to explain lots of other weird numbers-so why should n't we expect eventually to explain the cosmological constant and other key parameters ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concept irksome , since it posits a multitude of universes with which we can never interact , even in theory . Such a state of affairs does not provide a firm basis for further scientific research . Perhaps the most outspoken opponent of the anthropic approach is the cosmologist Lawrence Krauss of case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , who calls the principle " always a sort of excuse in the absence of good science-never a proof of anything . It 's just a way of killing time . " He adds , " If we do n't have a good idea about how to explain the cosniological constant , let 's say so ! " He derides the anthropic principle as " dangerous twice over . " For one thing , confusing its approach with fundamental understanding may be " dangerous to science " ; furthermore , " the public will imagine that science is no different from religion if science relies on the principle to explain anything . " If you adopt the idea of the multiverse , the anthropic principle may seem to furnish one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human minds . Could it be that for us to live on our speck of dust within this vast cosmos , a benevolent creator made an infinite number of cosmoses so that one of them would enable us to exist , somewhere within its confines ? Would n't it have been simpler to skip some of the bells and whistles-to stick to one universe , for instance ? Not necessarily . As the cosmologist Max Tegmark of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia has wondered , what seems so wasteful about our puny existence in a multiverse made up of an infinite number of infinite universes . Is it space ? But a single infinite universe already " wastes an infinite amount . Is it matter ? The same objection applies . Perhaps it is the waste of information , the additional description of universe upon universe required in a multiverse . But Tegmark points out that describing the totality of universes-the multiverse-may be simpler than describing just one universe , just as describing the full set of integers can be simpler than specifying a subset of them . For now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least among cosmologists and so long as they have no good explanation for the cosmological constant . The anthropic principle likewise will continue to be debated pro and con , as much on the grounds of philosophical acceptance or repugnance as on the basis of scientific logic . The debate will focus on cosmic issues that Descartes apparently never dreamed of . Einstein , though , met those issues head on , when he said to his assistant : What really interests me is whether God could have created the world any differently ; in other words , whether the demand for logical simplicity leaves any freedom at all . Sidebar Is- it only a " cosmic coincidence " that matter in the early universe was just lumpy enough for galaxies to form ? Sidebar The anthropic principle , says the cosmologist Lawrence Kraus s , is an " excuse in the absence of good science . . . . It 's just a way of killing time . " // <p>                  @ @ @
