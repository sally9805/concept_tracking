" Simple Electric Brain Machines and How to Make Them " // I do n't know where I first saw the advertisement for the Geniac Electric Brain construction kit , but I knew I had to have one for Christmas . It was the early 1960s , and like a lot of science-crazed kids I was obsessed with the wonderfully outrageous idea of " thinking machines . " I devoured the picture stories in Life magazine and the Saturday Evening Post about the electronic behemoths manufactured by companies like International Business Machines , Univac , and Remington Rand . The spinning tape drives and banks of blinking lights were as exciting to me as the idea of space travel . Two of my favorite books were Tom Swift and His Giant Robot and Danny Dunn and the Homework Machine-testaments to the eerie fantasy of automating human thought . One day , flipping through one of my favorite magazines-probably Boys ' Life or Popular Science-I stumbled upon an unbelievably tantalizing ad. // " Can you think faster than this Machine ? " // Below the provocative headline was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six large dials and a row of ten bulbs . Who knew what kind of mysterious circuitry was hidden inside ? // " GENIAC , the first electrical brain construction kit , is equipped to play tic-tac-toe , cipher and decipher codes , convert from binary to decimal , reason in syllogisms , as well as add , subtract , multiply and divide . . . . You create from over 400 specially designed and manufactured components a machine that solves problems faster than you can express them . " Such was the promise of the Oliver Garfield Co. , 126 Lexington Avenue , New York 16 , N.Y . ( This was before zip codes replaced the old numbered postal zones . ) To a boy growing up in Albuquerque , the location of this modern Frankenstein laboratory seemed promisingly exotic and far away . // " Send for your GENIAC kit now . Only $19.95 . . . . We guarantee that if you do not want to keep GENIAC after two weeks you can return it for full refund plus shipping costs . " // There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear to my parents that receiving a Geniac was all that mattered to me . Then I waited , my brain charged with the kind of high-voltage anticipation that can only accumulate in someone still in the first decade of life . // Christmas morning I sat on the floor anxiously opening presents , keeping my eye out for one large enough to hold the pieces of an electronic computer . Finally a likely box emerged from behind the tree . I tore off the wrapping . // Decades later I still remember the disappointment I felt as I explored the contents of the cardboard package . The title of the instruction manual was intriguing enough : " Simple Electric Brain Machines and How to Make Them . " But how was anyone to carry out such an ambitious project with the meager , humdrum parts that had been supplied ? // Digging through the pile , I was crestfallen to find that the bulk of the kit consisted of some decidedly low-tech pieces of particle board called Masonite : a big square one and six smaller round disks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was complemented by an assortment of hardware you might find in a kitchen junk drawer or a toolbox in the garage : ten flashlight bulbs and sockets , a battery and battery clamp , a spool of insulated wire , several dozen nuts , bolts , and washers , a bunch of small brass-plated staples ( referred to in the typewritten instructions as " jumpers " ) , and the tools for assembling this detritus into what would supposedly function as a digital computer-a hexagonal wrench for gripping bolts ( a " spintite " ) and a screwdriver . // Finally there was a simple on-off switch , described rather melodramatically in the manual : " This is the switch that enables you to put suspense and drama into your machine ; for you set everything the way it should be , then talk about it and explain it , and finally when you have your listener all keyed up and ready , you ( or he ) throw the switch . . . " // I 'd been had . There were no vacuum tubes , no transistors , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eviscerating dead radios and TV sets . All I 'd gotten for Christmas was a handy-dandy kit for stringing together mindlessly simple circuits of switches and bulbs . The nuts and bolts were to be placed in various holes on the square wooden panel and connected one to the other by wires running underneath . The little metal jumpers were to be inserted into holes in the Masonite disks , the ends bent over to keep them in place . When the disks were attached to the panel , with more bolts and washers , they could be turned to and fro so that the jumpers touched the heads of the bolts , forming connections that caused the lightbulbs to flash on and off . It was all just switches-simple enough for a child to understand . // Reluctantly I opened the manual , published , disconcertingly , in 1955 , and saw that it contained the familiar explanations of the wonders of electricity . ( " You can think of a battery as a pump , which is able to push electrons , or little marbles of electricity , away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus end of the battery . . . A flow of electrons is an electric current . " ) // The instructions went on to show how to assemble circuits and switches into various question-answering machines . // 1 . Whom do you prefer : ( a ) Marilyn Monroe ? or ( b ) Liberace ? // 2 . How would you put a thread in a small hole : ( a ) wet it ? or ( b ) tap it ? // 3 . Would you rather spend a day : ( a ) shopping on Fifth Avenue ? or ( b ) hunting in the woods ? // Depending on how you answered these and three other questions ( rotating the six circular switches so that they pointed to A or B ) , the current in the wiring would flow to one of two bulbs , M or F. The result was called a " Masculine-Feminine Testing Machine . " // Never mind the musty Eisenhower-era philosophy . Scientifically , the whole thing seemed obvious and dumb . Just changing the paper labels would turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a Jock or a Brain ( the 1960s version of " nerd " ) : " Would you rather spend a rainy afternoon : ( a ) building a crystal radio ? or ( b ) working out in the gym ? " The meaning was all in the eye of the beholder. // As I paged through the manual , other projects appeared slightly more interesting . The switches could be wired to make machines that added numbers . Turn dial A to indicate the first number , turn dial B to indicate the second , and if the copper paths behind the panel had been correctly platted , the lightbulb that came on would be the very one labeled with the proper answer . ( And if you made a mistake and did n't feel like redoing the wires , you could just move around the tags. ) // Rig the machine another way and you could subtract or multiply . Wire up the " Reasoning Machine " described on page 25 of the guide and turning switch A to indicate " All fighter pilots are bomber pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet pilots " would light the bulb for " No fighter pilots are jet pilots . " QED . A syllogism ( and a reminder that something can be logical but not true ) . // It was all terribly anticlimactic . Only years later would I realize that an utterly profound idea was slowly insinuating itself into my head : a computer is indeed just a box with a bunch of switches . The Geniac was " semiautomatic , " as the manual put it : You had to turn the dials by hand to light the lights . And to " reprogram " the machine , you had to unscrew nuts with the " spintite " and shift the wires around . But suppose that some of the bulbs were replaced with little motors . When activated by the proper combination of settings , the motors could turn switches on other Geniacs , which would cause the dials on still other Geniacs to spin . // All kinds of elaborations were possible . Data could be fed into a glorified Geniac not with clunky wooden rotary dials but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper patterns . Read like Braille by metallic fingers , the holes would cause electrical connections to be made . Instead of flashlight bulbs , the circuits could ignite phosphorescent dots on a video screen-which is really just an array of thousands of tiny lights . // In the computer 's modern incarnation , mechanical parts have been replaced by millions of microscopic transistors , minuscule switches etched onto the surfaces of silicon chips . Data are stored as invisible magnetic spots on spinning disks . But the basic idea is the same . // Only remnants of my Geniac survive . Going through a closet recently , I found a box of old electronic junk . There , sitting atop a partially dissected radio chassis and other relics of the vacuum-tube age , were three of the old dials . Two still had labels- " Candidate A : Popularity , " " Candidate A : Campaign Effort " - handwritten in black ink on strips of surgical adhesive tape . I had apparently tried to make a machine to predict election outcomes . // I could n't find the old manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the advertisement ) , reigniting old memories , is because I found the information in minutes on the World Wide Web . ( I also found a Geniac kit on eBay , which was auctioned off for more than $400 , twenty times its original price . ) I 'm still astonished by the speed with which data course through the great skein of computers called the Internet . But it is comforting to know that for all its complexity , the Net is just a bunch of Geniacs chattering at each other , twisting each other 's dials. // On page 37 of " Simple Electric Brain Machines and How to Make Them " came what was intended to be the climax : instructions for how to make a Geniac that played tic-tac-toe . But looking back years later , it 's clear to me that the real meat of the book was an innocent-sounding statement way back on page 3 : " The kit , though inexpensive and convenient for constructing Geniacs , is however not necessary ; and some persons will prefer to construct their Geniacs using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It was the form of the machine , not its substance , that mattered . If you wanted to really strip the idea of a computer to its essence , you did n't necessarily have to make it electrical . One could even be constructed from Tinkertoys. // Chapter Two // Tinkertoy Logic // In the lobby of the Boston Science Museum , protected by a Plexiglas case , stands a whimsical monument to this most incisive of ideas : the power of a computer arises not from the nature of its parts-be they transistors , microchips , vacuum tubes , wooden wheels , or pulleys and string-but from its architecture , how the parts are arranged . Flip open the side door of , say , a Macintosh G4 and the electronic innards look like a space-age city viewed from the sky . Copper-colored avenues shuttle electronic traffic between squat black structures reminiscent of suburban office buildings : the computer chips that , if magnified many times , look like little cities in themselves , populated by billions of microscopic structures laced together by wires whose thickness is measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so familiar that people now habitually reverse the metaphor , describing a suburban view from an airplane as looking like the layout of a chip . // This cartographic complexity seems to be the quintessence of computing . But for all the apparent differences , there is nothing going on inside the mightiest Macintosh or Dell or Compaq-or for that matter in the supercomputers like Blue Mountain and Q-that can not be done , in principle , with a stadium full of Geniacs , or even a sprawling contraption made from Tinkertoys , like the one in the Boston museum . In the mid-1970s , a group of computer-science students ( including Daniel Hillis , who went on to start a company called Thinking Machines ) gathered together more than a hundred Giant Engineer Tinkertoy sets , assembling the thousands of wooden spokes and spools into a computer that played a mean game of tic-tac-toe. // Anyone who cracks open the most basic high-school text on computer theory almost immediately learns two comfortingly simple truths : Any kind of data , from moves on a checkerboard to streaming videos , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 and 0 . And the data can be manipulated using basic operations called AND , OR , and NOT , trivial functions that can be carried out with simple little switches called gates . // If an " AND gate " receives a 1 signal at both of its inputs , A and B , then the device responds with a 1 : Yes . Otherwise it says No : 0 . An OR gate is less restrictive : it will fire if it receives a 1 at either A or B. And a NOT gate does nothing more than invert its input : If it receives a 1 it will say 0 , if it receives a 0 it will say 1 . Weave together millions of these elements and the result is a digital chain reaction . Ones and zeroes , representing words , numbers , pictures , sounds , or positions on a game board , ricochet through the circuitry like pachinko balls . A computation is performed . // It 's easy to see how such simple things could be made from ordinary switches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AND gate , two switches are connected one after the other so that both must be closed for current to flow and the bulb to light . In an OR gate , the switches are in parallel ; closing either one will complete the circuit . But it is merely incidental that the gates just described are electrical . The students , studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , took on the challenge of making them from the sticks and spoked wheels in a child 's set of Tinkertoys. // Suppose you have a Tinkertoy OR gate ( as shown on the next page ) . If either of the input shafts , A or B , is pushed to the right , the output shaft will move too . NOT and AND gates can also be constructed with Tinkertoys . By combining hundreds of gates , the MIT students built a complex mechanical contraption that would respond to any of its opponent 's moves . Clicking and clacking , the wooden pieces , each positioned just so , would process the information , finally coming back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-or-nothing diction of the binary tongue . Every round of the game leaves the board in a different state , with each of the nine cells of the crisscross pattern containing an X or an O or remaining unoccupied . After studying the game , the students made a list of the best way for a player to react to every situation . Suppose the human opponent is playing O and the board looks like this : // Obviously the computer can stave off defeat only by putting its X in the right-hand position of the middle row . // Without worrying about the details , one can imagine how this situation might be captured by a combination of rackety Tinkertoy gates manipulating Xs and Os instead of 1s and 0s . First , number the cells of the board starting in the upper-left corner . //
