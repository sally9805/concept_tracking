Name A Japanese corporate colossus , and chances are it started as a family firm  --  Mitsubishi , Sumitomo , Toyota , Kikkoman . Hundreds of millions of Indians garb themselves daily in cloth made by the Ambanis or Wadias . Residents of Hong Kong can barely avoid contributing to the coffers of billionaire Li Ka-shing and his sons , who control office towers , supermarkets , electronics outlets and telephone companies . Business in Asia is a family affair , and the most accurate picture of an Asian economy remains a diagram of an extended family tree connecting clans that make things to those that finance them , with dotted lines sometimes leading to the government . The payoff for decades of commercial consanguinity has varied from nation to nation . For more than 30 years the impoverished Indonesian archipelago was run as a mom-and-pop operation by the ruling Suharto family . In contrast , South Korea 's economic miracle was engineered by some 30 ambitious conglomerates called chaebol , almost all family controlled , while the commercial drive of industrious Hong Kong and Taiwan emanated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products and premises whenever better opportunities came along . <P> Today the majority of Asia 's publicly owned companies are still family controlled , and the manner in which control is exercised often can be boiled down to one sentiment : a family business is the family 's business . For decades top jobs at such companies have been passed down from fathers to sons and daughters , not to professional managers outside the clan . Profits have been used to shore up a sister ( or cousin ) company instead of going to shareholders . But if you talk to the patriarchs and scions of the families that own Asia , they will tell you that it is no longer business as usual . They have increasingly come under fire for inefficient , outmoded and nepotistic practices . One of the results of the 1997 Asian economic crisis was the devaluing of crony capitalism , that cloistered business-government cabal that parcels out national economic spoils to a privileged few . <P> Free trade , banking reform and global competition are making it harder for family businesses to carry on like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly owned companies to operate for the benefit of all stakeholders  --  not just gene holders . " The rules of the game have changed , " says Jamie Allen , secretary general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association in Hong Kong . <P> For proof , look to South Korea , where conglomerates have long been " run like ancient tribes to maximize political power for the leading families , " says Morgan Stanley economist Andy Xie . That changed with the ' 97 crisis , which caused the breakup of Hyundai Group and others and fostered an anti-chaebol backlash . Business life today in South Korea is marked by a steady stream of special investigations into chaebol-related bribery , stock manipulation , illegal campaign contributions , tax evasion and fraud . Chey Tae Won , nephew of the founder of SK Group , was jailed last year for accounting and stock fraud . Chung Mong Hun , the favorite son of Hyundai 's founder , killed himself last year after being accused of illegally passing money to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
