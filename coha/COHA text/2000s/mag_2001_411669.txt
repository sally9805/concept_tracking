<p> <p> At a big Madison Square Garden event , Hillary was booed , Bill was cheered . Win some , lose some . <p> <p> Will the Arab street hate us for fighting in Afghanistan during Ramadan ? Sure-but they will hate us for not fighting too . The cry about the sanctity of Ramadan is the dishonest mouth-warfare of the inflamed . Muhammed fought during Ramadan in 624 . In 1973 , Egypt and Syria attacked Israel during Ramadan , which also coincided with Yom Kippur-a twofer . In 1982 , Iran launched " Operation Ramadan , " an attack on Iraq . If one is willing to take lives in battle , then the cause must be of sufficient gravity to excuse relatively trivial profanations ; or one has no good cause , in which case fighting on holidays only underlines the transgression . If the enemy turns mosques into arsenals , then they become legitimate targets , for the same reason . In World War II , the Allies fought a pitched battle for the Abbey of Monte Cassino , which was reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirs will lose now , whatever the calendar says . <p> <p> Here is the face of the enemy . Six armed and bearded men stormed St. Dominic 's Roman Catholic church in Bahawalpur , Pakistan , while it was being used by a Protestant congregation . They killed the Muslim cop who was guarding the door . They killed the minister . They killed women and children . One of the assailants emptied his automatic rifle into a heap of the wounded , to make the work of murder more perfect . The logic of the assault was evidently that America is a majority-Christian nation , therefore Pakistani Christians , who are less than 3 percent of that population , are fair game for the pious jihadist . That 's as logical as killing thousands of Americans for the crime of going to work on a Tuesday . Let the Hero , born of woman , crush the serpent with His heel . <p> <p> Pretty much every day , terrorists gun down or blow up Israelis . The victims may be families in a pizzeria , four women out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the Israelis go in hot pursuit after the killers , and by all accounts they 're catching up with quite a number of them . We are making every effort to stop terrorists from killing more of us , too , and we 're planning to catch as many as we can . But just as we are moving into terrorist country , here comes the State Department to pressure the Israelis to move out of terrorist country . The argument seems to be that the Israelis are giving offense to Muslims , and must n't . We are no doubt giving offense too . What else are you expected to give in the process of defending yourself against murder ? There will be times when our interests and Israel 's diverge , of course , but terror is one and indivisible . It 's absurd that we go after terrorists but try to inhibit Israel from doing so . The State Department might consider a refresher course in logic . And one in common humanity , too . <p> <p> Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill said that parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " since they would probably not get enacted at the end of the day . O'Neill later semi-retracted the remark , but there was truth in what he said . The House Republicans know that not every pro-growth provision in their bill will become law . They passed an ambitious bill in the expectation that by doing so they would exert a positive influence on the bill that finally gets signed . One would think the Bush administration , too , would be trying to win as good a stimulus package as possible . But that would require it to have a secretary of the Treasury whose time is not occupied by cleaning up after his own gaffes . <p> <p> The Republican candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey , Mark Earley and Bret Schundler , are both trailing in the polls . Earley 's campaign got off to a late start , letting Democrat Mark Warner slickly repackage himself as a moderate . Schundler has suffered from the weak support of the Republican establishment and the state 's understandable inattention to the race . Both men have endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve to win . Earley and Schundler have been steadfast champions of conservative policy ideas , and both would do better by their states than their opponents , particularly when it comes to taxes and education . We 'll be rooting for them on November 6 . <p> <p> As New York City prepares to elect Rudy Giuliani 's successor , the horror of September 11 has drained much of the air of vanity from tyro Michael Bloomberg 's campaign on the Republican line . A billionaire could find easier things to do than labor to take on what will be one of the hardest jobs on earth , and Bloomberg 's persistence retroactively redeems his motives . It does not , however , boost his qualifications . He remains a liberal Democrat who switched parties to run for office . Many signs , from a patchwork reconstruction plan to an opportunistic alliance with the black radical sectary Lenora Fulani , show that he is not ready for prime time . His Democratic opponent , Mark Green , is as liberal as they come , a protg of Ramsey Clark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and government ; he has shown some signs of learning ( he is endorsed by Bill Bratton , Giuliani 's police commissioner ) ; and the attack may have sobered him . Conservative New Yorkers ca n't comfortably vote for either man , but they wish the winner , and his stricken constituency , well . <p> <p> The new anti-terrorism law expands federal powers to permit the detention of foreign nationals who are suspected terrorists for up to seven days . On the eighth day , however , they must go free-unless they 're charged with some crime . But getting serious about terrorism will require something more : greater deportation authority , more coercive interrogation methods , and ethnic profiling . The ACLU may howl at these proposals , but the only alternatives are cracking down on everyone by issuing national ID cards and frisking grandmothers at airports . <p> <p> Events in Northern Ireland continue to offer a seminar in how not to deal with terrorists . Following the September 11 attacks , terrorism is suddenly unpopular even among Sinn Fein supporters here in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ski masks has been seriously affected . Bending to these new realities , and perhaps also to the threatened withdrawal of a very lucrative book contract , Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams agreed to put a certain quantity ( unspecified ) of his arsenal of guns and explosives ( total size unknown ) " beyond use , " and the functionary charged with verifying this " decommissioning " confirmed that it had , in fact , been done . In response , the British government began dismantling three army watchtowers . Thus the deadly equivalence is reinforced : The lawfully empowered army and police forces of a constitutional , democratic state stand on the same ethical level as a clique of fanatics who consider that the justice of their own cause places them above all the restraints of decency , morality , law , and civilization . The Irish Republic has a properly constituted army of its own : Those calling themselves the " Irish Republican Army " are nothing but a gang of amoral hoodlums lacking any constitutional sanction , descendants of the losing side in the Irish Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent Irish people by the savagery of their tactics . Instead of hunting these terrorists down relentlessly , as we are now hunting down al-Qaeda , the British government , in pursuit of peace ( on the British mainland , that is ) at any price , has sunk to the folly of accepting them as negotiating partners . The full scope of that folly will be revealed when the unknown , but surely huge , quantities of non-decommissioned terrorist arms are taken from their hiding places and used against those who have all along been their main intended targets : the constitutional democrats of Ireland , both north and south . <p> <p> The Supreme Court has never ruled whether the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns or-the conventional liberal view-merely a " collective right " that applies only to the National Guard . But the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has just waded into the controversy with a decision that says , yes , the amendment protects an individual right in the same manner as the rest of the Bill of Rights . Constitutional protection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership are permissible ; indeed , the court upheld the restriction at issue in the case before it . The Second Amendment does not bar even foolish regulations of gun ownership . But it does mean that a ban on civilian handgun ownership , the ultimate goal of the gun-control groups , is impermissible . By dashing their fondest hopes , and allaying gun owners ' worst fears , the Fifth Circuit just may have made it possible to begin a civil and reasonable debate on guns . <p> <p> Following the tradition of Republican presidents making fools of themselves in small matters when visiting the Orient-Gerald Ford 's borrowed morning suit , Bush the First vomiting on the Japanese prime minister-George W. Bush donned a silk Mandarin jacket with frogged buttons at the summit in Shanghai . The president 's jacket was a fine Tory blue ; his host , Chinese number one Jiang Zemin , wore a similar item in , of course , bright red . In larger matters the Bush visit was a mixed bag . In a speech , the president spoke forthrightly , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse to persecute minorities . " The Chinese Communists , of course , see it as precisely such an excuse , and did not permit any of Bush 's speeches to be broadcast on China 's state-controlled TV . Only one jailed opponent of the Communists , U.S. citizen Wu Jianmin , was released ahead of the Bush visit . As the dismal calculus of these things goes , this was a meager offering , indicating that favors from the U.S. government are trading at a new low since September 11 . The way the Communists see it , we need them much more than they need us right now . Ergo , they do not even have to pretend to be listening when we press our concern for human rights in China . It is to Bush 's credit that , according to his officials , he pressed it anyway . <p> <p> Zambia is one of Africa 's poorest and most debt-ridden countries , yet President Frederick Chiluba lives in grand style , indulging a taste for Rolex watches and gold jewelry . The presidency of Zambia comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes a long way in the Third World . Could this be how Chiluba finances his lifestyle ? Er , no : A keen-eyed bank clerk in Ndola recently noticed that the president 's salary had , in fact , been illegally diverted for a full year into the account of a local businessman of similar name , without the president noticing . Chiluba would not , of course , be the first person to master the art of living off his expense account , but you would think he might glance at his bank statements once in a while . Too busy fighting corruption , we guess . <p> <p> Naguib Mahfouz , who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988 , is a dazzling novelist , whose Cairo Trilogy may well be read for as long as novels are read . He has not had an easy time of it in his own country , Egypt , where he has been physically attacked by fundamentalists , and where some of his books are banned . Yes , some Mahfouz novels can be read only outside Egypt-which should tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview to an Egyptian newspaper in which he says the usual outrageous things about America and the present war : Our actions in Afghanistan , he says , are " just as despicable a crime " as the terror on September 11 . And then he gives the standard line about the " root causes " of terrorism , strongly implying that America has brought mass murder on itself . President Bush had it right : In the present hour , you are either with us-civilization-or with them-barbarism . And Naguib Mahfouz is only the latest in a long line of dazzling artists who have sided with the barbarians . <p> <p> How many Muslims are there in the United States ? Hard to say : By law , the U.S. Census may not ask questions about religion . NR 's John Derbyshire , relying upon what he took to be an impeccable source ( to wit , The Economist ) , recently included the figure of 6 million in an article on racial profiling ( " At First Glance , " October 15 ) . This figure , it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out by Muslim organizations for their own advantage . Now two careful , independent studies by demographers of repute have come up with answers strikingly close to each other : between 1.8 and 1.9 million-which is to say , less than a third of the much-broadcast 6 million . The American Muslim Council was naturally furious with these demographers , and charged one of them with trying to " deny the existence of 4 1/2 million American Muslims . " They further accused him of " tearing at the very heart of America . " They then went on to claim that their own estimate of " more than 7 million " Muslims came from the 2000 U.S. Census figures . But hold on there a minute : By law , the U.S. Census may not <p> <p> Jonathan Franzen 's hot , hip new novel , The Corrections , has made him both a best-seller and well-reviewed dude . It has also made him a horse 's ass . When The Corrections was picked by Oprah Winfrey as a selection for her book club , Franzen worried that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame . " She 's picked some good books , " he told an interviewer , " but she 's picked enough schmaltzy , one-dimensional ones that I cringe , myself , even though I think she 's really smart . " No one can accuse Franzen of being really smart , or really gracious . How would the popes of high modernism have handled an Oprah pick , which includes a turn on her show ? T. S. Eliot would have jumped at the opportunity to air his cagey persona . Ezra Pound would have harangued about the beauties of Provence and the evils of the Bank of England . James Joyce would have been a trickier subject , but properly stroked , he might have sung an Irish song or two in his rich tenor . Miss Winfrey , rightly irked by Franzen 's airs , rescinded the TV appearance , though she stuck by the book pick . Franzen can stay where he belongs , addressing seminars of groupies at Bennington , Bard , and Antioch . <p> <p> The composer George Frederick Handel ( 1685-1759 ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor of Music at M.I.T. and author of several books on the composer . Dr. Harris bases her inference not on any new researches into Handel 's personal life , about which next to nothing is known , but on " the clear homosexual subtext " she has discerned in his operatic works . As further evidence , our percipient musicologist notes that much of Handel 's music is punctuated by long silences . " It is quite striking and very emotional , " she asserts . " It denotes something that can not be said-love that dares not speak its name , if you like . " We do n't . <p> <p> John H. " Jack " Plumb was a spectacular figure among modern British historians . He spent his entire academic career as master of Christ 's College , Cambridge , where he had studied under the great G. M. Trevelyan . His permanent contribution to history was in the 18th-century field , and principally the important figure of Robert Walpole , whom he saw as the architect of British political stability . Walpole 's politics of stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But stability led to prosperity , and thus to world power . You can say that Walpole made Edmund Burke possible . Jack Plumb completed two magnificent volumes of his Walpole biography-but never completed the whole . He had a great gift for popular writing as well , and in a very 18th-century way he loved fine living and also very expensive antique porcelain . His collection is a marvel to behold . His popular histories on various subjects are readable and valuable , and they made him rich . Perhaps one of his many students will complete his Walpole . He has died at 90 in Cambridge . Ave atque vale . <p>
