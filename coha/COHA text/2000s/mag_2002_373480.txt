But she took over two bankrupt subsidiaries and made them profitable within a year . And she helped sell a big stake in Grupo Modelo to Anheuser-Busch . Now the brewer of Corona is in proven hands : Aramburuzabala , 39 , is vice chairman , and the company 's profits rose 20% during the first half of this year . <P>  --  THOMAS KANG Seoul Man <P> Four years ago , merger specialist Kang was ready for a change . So when a representative of George Soros ' investment firm asked the Korean-born New Yorker to run Seoul Securities , a foundering brokerage house that Soros had bought , Kang , now 40 , jumped . And he has delivered : he transformed Seoul Securities from a mom-and-pop retail shop to a full-service firm with investment-banking and money-management arms . The company has turned a profit in every quarter since his arrival . <P>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
