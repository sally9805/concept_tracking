A life spent fulfilling a vow to a dead man is really no life at all , but I 'd loved Simon Malone , and I 'd promised . I 'm a zoologist by trade , a cryptozoologist by choice . If I 'd followed my training , I 'd be holed up in a zoo or worse , studying giraffes and pygmy goats . Instead , I trace rumors of mythical animals and try to prove they exist . A frustrating exercise . There 's a reason no one 's captured a Bigfoot . They do n't want to be found , and they 're a lot better at hiding than anyone on earth is at seeking . Or at least that 's my theory , and I 'm sticking to it . Most cryptozoologists attempt to find undiscovered species or evolutionary wonders -- real animals , nothing paranormal about them -- but not me . Nope . I 'd made that vow . Foolish , but when a woman loves a man the way that I loved Simon , she does foolish things , especially when he 's dying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk tale , every scrap of information , trying to uncover something mythical and prove it real . Though I 've never believed in magic , my husband did , and the only thing I 've ever believed in was him . I was having very little luck with my quest until the night the phone rang at 3:00 a.m . Insomnia and a very empty checking account made me answer it despite the hour . " Hello ? " " Dr. Malone ? " The voice was male , a bit shaky , old or perhaps ill . " Not yet . " I needed to find a cryptid -- translation : unknown animal -- prove its existence , write a thesis . Then I could attach those lovely letters -- Ph.D.  - -  at the end of my name . But since the whole vow incident , I 'd been too busy chasing lake monsters and Sasquatch clones to spendtime finding a new breed of anything . " Is this Diana Malone ? " " Yes . Who 's this ? " " Frank Tallient . " The name sounded familiar , but I could n't figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I got your number from Rick Canfield . " Swell . The last guy who 'd said those immortal words , " You 're fired . " Rick was a lawyer who 'd gone on a fishing trip with a bunch of other lawyers near Lake of the Woods , Minnesota . In the middle of the night he 'd seen something in the lake . Something slick and black and very , very big . Being a lawyer , he was smart enough to know he should n't tell the others he 'd lost his mind . Not yet . Instead , he 'd gone home , searched the Internet , and made some phone calls , trying to find someone to help him discover if what he 'd seen had been real or imagined . He 'd found me . " Rick thought you 'd be free to help me , " Tallient continued . I was free all right . Unemployed . Again . A common occurrence in my life . I was very good at looking for things , not so good at actually finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryptozoologists willing to travel on a whim for cash . I was n't associated with any university -- not anymore . Not since Simon had gone over the edge , tarnishing both his reputation and my own . I depended on the kindness of strangers -- hell , let 's be honest and just call them strange -- to fund my expeditions . Until tonight , I 'd been fresh out of both . " Since you did n't locate Nessie --  , " Tallient began . " Nessie 's the Loch Ness Monster . I was searching for Woody . " Which was the name Rick had bestowed on the thing . People have no originality when naming lake beasts , always opting for some variation of the body of water they supposedly resided in . Typically , the moment I 'd arrived at Lake of the Woods with my cameras and recorders whatever Rick might have seen had gone poof . If it had ever been there in the first place . In my expert opinion , an obscenely large muskie was responsible for the tales , not a supernatural lake monster , but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a job for you , " Tallient continued . " I 'm listening . " I had no choice . Though my parents were incredibly wealthy , they thought I was nuts and had stopped speaking to me the instant I married Simon . After all , what could a handsome , brilliant , up-and-coming zoologist from Liverpool see in a not-very-pretty , far too sturdy grad student unless it was her parents ' millions ? He already had a green card . That Simon had told them exactly what they could do with their money had only made me love him more . In truth , I fit into Simon 's world better than I 'd ever fit in my own . I stood five-foot-ten in my bare feet ; on a good day I weighed a hundred and seventy . I liked the out-of-doors -- did n't mind dirt or sun , wind or rain . I 'd joined the Girl Scouts just so I could camp . I 'd done pretty much anything and everything I could think of to emphasize my differences from the never-too-rich , never-too-thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet ? " Tallient asked . " Hold on . " I tapped my laptop , which sprang from asleep to awake much quicker than I ever did . " OK . " Tallient recited a www-dot address . An instant later , a newspaper article spilled across my screen . " Man Found Dead in a Swamp , ' " I read . " Not unusual . " Swamps were notorious dumping grounds for bodies . If the muck did n't take them , the alligators would . " Keep going . " " Throat torn . Feral dogs . Huh . " I accessed the next page . " Child missing . Coyotes . No body . Seems straightforward . " " Not really . " Tallient recited a second address , and I read some more . " Wolf sightings . " My heart increased in tempo . Wolves had been Simon 's specialty ; they 'd turned into his obsession . Now they were mine . " Where is this ? " I demanded . " New Orleans . " If possible , my heart beat even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic to the Gulf and west to Texas . They 'd been sighted as far north as Missouri and Pennsylvania . But in 1980 the red wolf had been declared extinct in the wild . In 1987 they 'd been reintroduced , but only in North Carolina . So . . . " There are n't any wolves in Louisiana , " I said . " Precisely . " " There 's a legend , though . . . . " I struggled to remember it . " Honey Island Swamp monster . " " I doubt that Bigfoot-like footprints found thirty years ago have any relationship to death , disappearance , and wolves where they are n't supposed to be . " He had a point . " Could be an ABC , " I ventured . The anacronym stood for " Alien Big Cat "  - -  a cyptozoological label given to reports of out-of-place felines . Black panthers in Wisconsin . A jaguar in Maine . Happens a lot more than you 'd think . Most of the time ABCs were explained away as exotic animals released into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big to fit in an apartment . Funny thing was , no one ever found them . If they were pets , would n't they be easy to catch ? Would n't their bones , or even their collars , turn up after a truly wild animal killed them ? Would n't there be at least one record of an ABC being hit by a truck on the interstate ? But there was n't . " This is a wolf , not a cat , " Tallient said . I was impressed with his knowledge of cypto-terminology but too caught up in the mystery unfolding before my eyes to compliment him on it . " Same principle , " I murmured . " Could be someone dumped a wolf in the swamp . Nothing special about it . " Except wolves were n't vicious . They did n't attack people . Unless they were starving , wolf-dog hybrids , or rabid . None of which were a good thing . " There 've been whispers of wolves in and around New Orleans for years , " he continued . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ? " Tallient chuckled . " I thought you 'd enjoy that . The disturbances do n't seem to occur in any particular month , or even a common season . But they always happen during the same lunar phase . " " Full moon , " I guessed . No matter what the skeptics say , full moons drive people and animals wacko . Ask anyone who 's ever worked in an emergency room , psych ward , or county zoo . " Not full , " Tallient said . " Crescent . " I glanced at the thin , silver , smiling moon visible from my window . " What was the date on those articles ? " " May . " I frowned . Five months ago . " Since then ? " " Nothing . " " Could be because the bodies were n't found . " " Exactly . Things that hunt under a certain phase of the moon do so every month . They ca n't help themselves . " I was n't sure about " things , " but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of habit . " A body was found yesterday , " Tallient continued . " Has n't hit the papers yet . " I looked at the moon again . Guess I was right . " What 's your interest in this ? " I asked . " Cryptozoology fascinates me . I 'd love to go on an expedition , but I 'm . . . not well . " I stood . My feet literally itched . I bounced on my toes as excitement threatened to make me jump at this chance . I had to remember : What seemed too good to be true often was . " You want to pay me to find a wolf where a wolf is n't supposed to be . Once I do , then what ? " " Trap it and call me . " Not an unusual request in my line of work . The people who hired me usually did so in the hopes that they would become famous by revealing some mythical creature to the world , and they wanted to be the ones to do the revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disclosure took place . All I wanted was to prove Simon had n't been crazy . " I can do that , " I agreed . " You do realize this is n't just a wolf ? " I hoped not , but my hopes were n't often realized . " They call it a loup-garou , " Tallient continued . " That 's French for --  " " Werewolf . " The rush of adrenaline made me dizzy . Though I took jobs searching for any paranormal entity -- beggars could n't be choosers -- the true focus of my quest should have been a lycanthrope . As Simon 's had been . The only problem was , I just could n't believe . Even though my maiden name was O'Malley and my father 's family hailed from the land of leprechauns and fairies , in Boston , where I grew up , the only fanciful thing was the city 's rabid belief in a curse on the BoSox . In my youth there 'd been no nonsense allowed -- no Santa , no tooth fairy -- I had to fight to read fiction . Which might explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of magic . I glanced around our apartment near the campus of the University of Chicago . I had n't moved a book , had n't given away his clothes , had n't realized until just this moment how pathetic that was . " I find it strange , " Tallient continued , " that odd things happen under a crescent moon in the Crescent City , do n't you ? " I found it more than strange . I found it irresistible . " Are you interested ? " Why did he bother to ask ? He had to have heard how Simon had died . He had to know Dr. Malone 's sterling reputation had wound up in tatters . Tallient might not be aware that I 'd vowed to make everyone who 'd scorned Simon eat their words , but he had to suspect it considering what I 'd been doing in the four years since my husband had died . My gaze fell on the only picture I had of Simon -- knee-deep in a Canadian lake , slim , scholarly , blond , and brilliant -- his grin still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time I remembered he was gone forever . But his hopes , his dreams , his work , lived on in me . " I 'll be on a plane in the morning . "
