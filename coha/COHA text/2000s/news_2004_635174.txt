Some older buyers have mentioned that they want elevator buildings instead of walk-ups . <p> " A lot of people are moving back to the neighborhood , " Sutherland said . " They moved to the suburbs and now see all the changes and want to move back . " <p> The classic architectural styles were agreed upon by the builder , the city and the community , he said .

The convenient area , bordered by Paulina , Wrightwood , Wellington and Diversey , was too near the Clybourn Corridor and other new housing areas to limit its use . <p> Ron Shipka Sr. , of Enterprise Development Co. , pioneered the neighborhood more than 10 years ago with projects such as the Terra Cotta Village town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 212 single-family and town houses that replaced the old Stuart-Warner Corp . factory at 180 N.

" And we will be installing new street lights , adding additional landscaping and using decorative pavement instead of traditional asphalt within the interior road of the town homes . " <p> Paramount Homes has been another major mover in the Paulina area . The success of the neighborhood can be seen in $2.1 million price tags for its single-family homes in Wrightwood Park Place , at 2655 N. Paulina Ave . <p> The houses have 5 bedrooms , 41/2 baths and 6,000 square feet of living space , large by any neighborhood 's standards , extremely rare for the popular Lincoln Park/Lake View area . <p> Features in the three-story brick houses include two fireplaces , two roof decks , English basements , skylights , two sets of washers and dryers , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Even with a $2.1-million price tag these are still affordable by Lincoln Park standards , " said Bruce Fogelson , Paramount president . <p> Belmont Avenue began serious westward expansion and new settlement after the Belmont River Club sprung up on a tranquil patch of land on the west side of the Chicago River 's North Branch . Since then new construction has been moving farther out . <p> The town houses of Kilbourn Park , at 4500 W. Belmont , have established the current western boundary of major new construction . <p> " Kilbourn Park is beating all of our expectations by a long shot , " said Mike Kelahan , director of sales and marketing for Dubin Residential , the builder . <p> The three-story town houses are brick-and-frame construction with 2 or 3 bedrooms , 2 baths and 2-car garages .

They could have purchased an existing single-family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been decades old , he said . <p> " They like the idea of the new construction and the fact they are under warranty , " he said . <p> Many of the other buyers are younger singles and couples moving from apartments or condos to the east , he said . <p> " They are looking for the value they can get by moving a little farther west , " Kelahan said . <p> The Kilbourn town houses all have 2-car garages and most of the buyers have at least one car , if not two , he said . <p> " Everybody in the city has a car now , " he said . " It used to be you moved to the city so you did n't have to own a car . " <p> Dubin purchased the old Florsheim shoe plant at Belmont and Pulaski , which it plans to convert into condominiums . The company is still working with the city and the neighborhood on the details . The block-long building could accommodate about 200 new condominiums .
