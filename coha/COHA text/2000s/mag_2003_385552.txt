Section : LETTERS you may be right <p> I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN YOUR CHOICE OF ELAINE PAGELS AS the focus of your interview ( " Matthew , Mark , Luke .... and Thomas ? " September ) . While her scholarship is to be respected , she is not representative of what I understand to be the views of most Catholic biblical scholars regarding the value of the gnostic gospels . <p> Her speculation that the Gospel of John was written in response to the Gospel of Thomas may be partially correct , but her suggestion that one would need the Gospel of Thomas as a corrective to the view of the Gospel of John is a real stretch . The corrective , if one were needed , is already in the canon of scripture . Her real concern seems to be that John 's gospel emphasizes our need for grace . <p> As someone who teaches scripture to volunteer catechists , I am amazed at the interest that the Gospel of Thomas generates . Those who have heard of it tend to ask questions with eagerness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen with wide eyes . Interest in this gospel wanes in my classes as soon as I read its conclusion : " Simon Peter said to him Jesus , ' Let Mary Magdalene leave us , for women are not worthy of life . ' Jesus said , ' I myself shall lead her in order to make her male , so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males . For every woman who makes herself a male will enter the kingdom of heaven ' " ( Saying 114 , translated by Thomas O. Lambdin ) . <p> In light of the explicit sexism in the text of this gospel , I find it strange that either Dr. Pagels or the editors of U.S. CATHOLIC would seem to imply that this document is an example of gender inclusivity . Charlie Conaghan Pittsfield , Mass . <p> <p> Thank you for the interview with Elaine Pagels . So much of the story of the writings of the early Christians  --  which ones made it into the canon of sacred scripture and which ones did n't  --  illustrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church to have a dialogue about and discern the issues . <p> The writers who document the faith development of the early church ( Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John ) would probably feel right at home in our current efforts to discern the is sues related to faith , morals , and the spiritual life . Imagine attending a panel discussion with the big four and some current clergy and scholars . L. B. Hoge Brandon , Fla . <p> Wrong word <p> I was dumbstruck when I read that " Catholics reenact ... Christ 's sacrifice on the cross for the forgiveness of sins " in the September Glad You Asked by Joel Schorn . The Catechism of the Catholic Church says the sacrament of the Eucharist is called " the memorial of the Lord 's Passion and Resurrection " and " the Holy Sacrifice , because it makes present the one sacrifice of Christ the Savior . " A memorial is not the same thing as a reenactment . We must get this word out of our consciousness in talking about the Mass . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current Jewish Passover celebration a reenactment of the Exodus , which it clearly is not . It , too , is a memorial or a remembrance , but it is celebrated in such a way that the Passover from slavery to freedom is real today , much the same as our eucharistic celebration makes Jesus ' presence real for us today . Norbert Bufka Midland , Mich . <p> Gather the children <p> I enjoyed the August cover story ( " How to draw kids into Mass " ) by Leslie Scanlon . I think churches across the nation have various ways to help draw children into the Mass . <p> One of the best ideas I have ever seen ( and I am 56 years old ) is when one of our most beloved priests would ask the " little ones " to come up to the altar before the consecration of the Eucharist . How beautiful to see these 30 to 50 children come up , some carrying their younger siblings in their arms , watching the priest speak to them about the importance of what he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children just naturally seem to follow the priest 's bowing and kneeling . There is no talking among them , and they seem to feel that they are helping the priest perform his duties . They stay there until after the Lord 's Prayer  --  and often lead the congregation in reciting it . <p> I can imagine as they grow older they will look forward to the day when they have children and can bring them to Mass and let them participate in this same wonderful way . Dave Chavez Carson , Calif . <p> Who wrote the script ? <p> The August editors ' interview with Scott Alexander ( " Do n't know much about Islam ? " ) was quite informative in explaining the various traditions of Islam . His clarification of Islam 's understanding of the Qur'an vis -- vis our Bible is very helpful . However , I think , his characterization of President Bush 's reaction to 9/11 is misleading . <p> If you believe that President Bush 's reaction to 9/11 was scripted by Osama bin Laden , then you must posit that President Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> President Clinton used the law-enforcement model in his response to the bombings of the World Trade Center , the U.S.S. Cole , and the two African embassies . <p> In fact , the U.S. has used the law-enforcement model for over 20 years in dealing with attacks against Americans in the Middle East . <p> Responding to acts of warlike terrorism with a law-enforcement approach did not deter bin Laden by making him pull his hair out , as Alexander suggests . Rather , it emboldened bin Laden 's resolve to raise the level of aggression and terror against the U.S. , which he did . Steve Shelly Fremont , Calif . <p> <p> The interview with Alexander started out as an attempt to be informative but wound up being just another propaganda piece for the left . Alexander says , " Bin Laden wants all the Muslims in the world to become convinced that the West is inherently evil . " He ignores the fact that most of the world of Islam has thought the West was evil for decades . Islam hates us because of our support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed " decadence . " <p> I think if President Bush and our country had rolled over and " just taken it " once again , as we have from Islamic terrorists so often in the past , then we would be in the same situation we were on September 11 . No , we are much better off now because we are proactively hunting down terrorist organizations worldwide and attempting to remove the power and infrastructure they need to pull off the despicable murderous acts that they have been doing for the previous 50 years . <p> How about some balance in U.S. CATHOLIC and not the steady stream of leftist politics ? Bob Wilson Meridan , Okla . <p> Comfy for the winter <p> I really enjoyed Peter Gilmour 's July Odds &; Ends column ( " Christmas in July " ) . As the pastor of two parishes in a resort area , it hit home . <p> From May to September , we have to double our weekend Mass schedule ( from three Masses to six ) to accommodate all the people . I am just grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have many people coming to their summer homes in addition to the weekend tourists spending time along the beautiful St. Lawrence River . <p> Our solution was to have two collections from May to October . The second one is for the " winter needs of the parish " ( fuel and religious education ) . <p> So while we do n't have " Christmas in July , " we are able to survive during the cold and lonely days of a northern New York winter . Father Thomas F. Driscoll Alexandria Bay , N.Y . <p> Spiritual recall <p> Thank you for the July Practicing Catholic ( " Psalm Pilot " ) by Ed Block on the importance of memorization . I , too , have found the memorization of psalms to be a source of inspiration and comfort . <p> Memorization itself is a source not only of intellectual discipline but also of spiritual companionship  --  the prayers or poems that one commits to memory can provide solace in times of stress . Even a one-line biblical reference such as " Be still and know that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's constant presence . <p> I would also encourage readers to experiment with the memorization of poetry as well as psalms . <p> In a time when information is easily available through the Internet , the need for memorization may seem small . But memorization creates a deeper sense of intimacy , even a sense of identification with what is memorized . For this reason , it seems to me that memorization is even more beneficial now as a means to preserve and promote our individual connection to the Word of God . Olivia Gatti Taylor Milwaukee , Wis . <p> Good news , bad news <p> May I express some good news first , then some brief bad news ? <p> Thanks so very much for your July interview with Dr. Myles Sheehan , S.J. ( " Death  --  It 's a part of life " ) . How I wish that every doctor , every priest , bishop , and every adult could read that superlative interview . <p> As an ordained priest , celibate , then married for 45 years , with many years experience in ministry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheehan 's wonderful insights . <p> Now for the bad news . My wife and I urgently invite Kevin Clarke to reduce his inflammatory rhetoric as typified in his July Margin Notes ( " There 's no defense for this budget " ) . More than two dozen examples light up his " irrational exuberance " ( to quote Greenspan ) . <p> May Clarke study the refined , mature answers of Sheehan . One can oppose something without talking or writing as a smart aleck . James Beiersdorfer Sun City Center , Fla . <p>
