<p> Boulder - Among the 900 members and friends at a Kappa Alpha Psi luncheon in May honoring standout high school students , University of Colorado Regent Pete Steinhauer was in the minority . Sitting among those gathered at the African- <p> American fraternity event was n't uncomfortable , he said . But it was eye-opening . <p> " In there , I was one of probably 15 Caucasians , " Steinhauer said . <p> The experience gave him a clearer idea of the isolation felt by CU 's black football players during the recent investigations into the football program . Some have received death threats . Hate mail is common . Many question if there is racial profiling in Boulder . Even dating someone of another race draws stares , some say . <p> " Being a black athlete in Boulder , you 're going to stand out , " said defensive end Marques Harris , who recently said he is transferring . " CU tries to talk about how diverse they are . But when you look at the real numbers , they are n't diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as a predominantly white campus , many were surprised when the independent commission investigating the football program released its report in May . The report showed CU had just 448 African-American undergraduate students on campus in the 2003-04 school year . Official enrollment figures put the number of black students even lower . University figures show 391 of 24,540 undergraduates last school year were black , or 1.6 percent , the lowest rate in the Big 12 Conference . Sixty-nine of those were student-athletes . <p> It did n't take release of those numbers for the issue to hit home for Steinhauer . At the May luncheon , CU president Betsy Hoffman was a guest speaker and helped recognize more than 20 African-American students who , after exceptional work at the high school level , were taking their talents to college . <p> " All but one were seniors , " Steinhauer said . " Some were athletes , some were musicians , some were mathematicians , some were scientists . They were going all over the country into these wonderful schools . " <p> And not one was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " caught my attention , huge . " <p> Racial imbalance is a historical problem at CU , but tensions simmering below the surface have flared during the investigations into whether the football program used sex and alcohol to recruit its athletes . <p> " The environment that exists today I think is the environment that we 've known to be Boulder ever since ( I was ) there , " said Charles Johnson , quarterback for the Buffaloes ' 1990 national championship team . " But I think the issue has gotten a helluva lot more charged given the nature of the claims against some of the student-athletes up there . So that ugly monster is rearing its head right now , but I do n't think the environment is any different than it 's ever been . " <p> In light of the commission 's report , and subsequent critical comments by football coach Gary Barnett , CU 's administration has said it will aggressively address shortcomings in its recruitment of blacks and work to foster a better climate for black students . At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some contend could potentially slow the recruitment of black student-athletes . <p> Barnett , who has lost three starters to transfers this spring , all black , gave the university a tongue-lashing last month for not doing enough to create a better environment for black students . Steinhauer said he 's ready to help lead a charge for more effective racial integration on campus . Provost Phil DiStefano supports CU 's current initiatives , but stressed the importance of improvement . The athletic department last week formed a diversity committee and had its first meeting . <p> Johnson wants results , not more talk : " It always seems to be window dressing because the numbers never seem to change . " <p> Death threats and discrimination <p> Fullback Lawrence Vickers arrived from Houston in 2002 looking for a change from the huge metropolis where he grew up . <p> " I wanted a different environment , " he said , " wanted to see different things . " <p> He never figured the storm of accusations would result in death threats . He said he 's received three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also had the driver's-side window on his car smashed out , which he believed was connected to a backlash against black athletes , although it could not be proved . <p> " It disturbs you , " he said . " ... It 's just been crazy walking to class , people getting off the sidewalk when you walk . You 're going to eat , and all eyes are on you . " <p> Black athletes point to specific reasons why they believe they are singled out . <p> Four football players , all black , were the only people charged after the December 2001 party where recruits were provided alcohol . Harris was one of the players charged . The police report states that alcohol was also provided by women at the party . <p> Last winter , two CU football players were asked for DNA samples to prove they were n't the alleged rapists of a CU student . According to a police report , the alleged victim 's memory was vague , but she said she met two black men at a bar , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big guys . " <p> Critics have accused Boulder District Attorney Mary Keenan of unfairly castigating the university without having conducted a thorough investigation and say that her statements about CU 's football program were rooted in a bias against black players . The sharpest criticisms of Keenan have come from lawyers who have represented minority defendants in sexual assault cases in Boulder . <p> Keenan dismisses such claims as outrageous . <p> " If there is any perception on the part of the public that a prosecution by this office would be less than totally objective , that 's a real concern to me , " Keenan previously said . <p> Vickers said something as common as interracial dating is viewed with suspicion . <p> " Even if you do n't ( date white girls ) , you 're still threatened if somebody even sees you talking to a white girl or if somebody sees you going out with one or if it 's a group of people . " <p> Anonymous letters were sent through the mail from Akron , Ohio , to players Chris Hollis , Akarika Dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in derogatory terms a displeasure for black men dating white women . <p> " It is RACISM when black men do n't want their own black women , " one letter read . <p> The letters were forwarded to CU police by director of football operations David Hansburg . Police investigated and determined it was likely a one-time occurrence . <p> Not all black players say they 've felt threatened . Running back Bobby Purify said he has not received any death threats and the little hate mail he has received is par for the course for a football player . He did , however , sympathize with his teammates . <p> " No one wants to hear , ' I 'm going to kill you if I see you ' or anything like that , " Purify said . " It 's just a messed-up situation . " <p> An indictment from the coach <p> Shortly after his reinstatement May 27 , Barnett took the university to task with comments about the atmosphere that surrounds black athletes in Boulder . They were so revealing , many were mystified at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to be competitive in the cutthroat world of recruiting . <p> " ( Black players ) do n't have the same quality of life that a white athlete has or a white student , " Barnett said . " I think this school and this community is a hard place for African-American student- <p> athletes to feel like they are comfortable . I think that within the university and within the community , it has become a difficult place for them . " <p> He later told the CU campus radio station that cornerback Sammy Joseph was transferring because of an uncomfortable campus environment for black players . Joseph told The Denver Post that was n't the reason he is leaving . He did , however , acknowledge receiving hate mail " when the whole investigation was going down " but praised the coaching staff for providing support . <p> Barnett did not respond to interview requests for this story . <p> Robbie Robinson , a CU safety from 1999 to 2001 , said he was not surprised by what has happened to many of the current black players because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers walking across campus and being greeted by a racial slur spray-painted on the side of the library . <p> " It happens , and that happens everywhere ; you ca n't just pigeonhole CU , " Robinson said . " But I think it 's more apt to happen when you 've got the limited interaction between blacks and whites . " <p> The city of Boulder has an even smaller percentage of black population than the campus - just 1.2 percent . <p> CU has not lacked initiatives to improve its recruitment efforts . In 1998 , it opened its Office of Diversity and Equity . In 1999 , it released a report it called " Campus Diversity Plan : A Blueprint for Action , " which outlined strategies on how the university planned to recruit and graduate students of color , and ensure a productive environment on campus . <p> DiStefano , who will oversee the athletic department as a result of a department reorganization by Hoffman , denies CU has been lax in addressing the problem . <p> " It has been a priority , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with football players here on campus , the issue of diversity has been heightened , and I think more people outside of the university have been looking at it . " <p> Steinhauer said CU 's intentions have been good , but it 's time for results . <p> " There 's been enough talk on this in the diversity conferences , " he said . " Most of the time , we are just preaching to the choir . " <p> According to CU 's admissions office , for the 2003-04 school year , the university received 357 applications from African-American students . Of those , 258 were accepted , and 85 enrolled . <p> The CU athletic department has taken action . It formed a diversity committee last week consisting of assistant football coach Chris Wilson , director of men 's basketball operations Gerald Harris , head volleyball coach Pi'i Aiu , associate athletic director John Meadows , special events coordinator Lisa Van Goor , and director Candice Bowen of CU 's Office of Sexual Harassment Policy . The group is charged with developing a five-year plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices and behavior . <p> Higher standard , unknown effect <p> At a time when CU is announcing its intentions to recruit more black students , it also plans to tighten academic admission standards for athletes , which , some are concerned , could make it tougher for minorities to be admitted . New guidelines could be made public this week when the Board of Regents meets . <p> At the top of the list is narrowing the " academic window " that allows students who do n't meet all admissions standards to still be admitted . CU fans have called talk radio shows expressing concern that this will harm the football team , which currently is almost 50 percent black . DiStefano frowns at the insinuation that a tighter academic window will make it more difficult to recruit black student-athletes . <p> " When you say that , " DiStefano said , " you are making a statement that students of color across the board do n't have the qualifications to get in , and I do n't think that 's the case . " <p> But he does say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows , " of ( all ) the student athletes who come through a window , probably the majority are students of color . " <p> According to the independent investigative commission , about 73 percent of the football team was admitted to Colorado through the window . On the 2003 football team , 50 of the 107 players were black . The state mandates that only 20 percent of students admitted to the university can come through the window . <p> DiStefano has said CU athletics will soon narrow its window rate to 20 percent and then the university as a whole will narrow to 10 percent over the next four or five years . <p> If so , Barnett said , the Buffs will have to broaden their recruiting base nationwide to get a large enough pool of athletes from which to choose . In order for that to happen , he said , CU would likely have to spend more on recruiting . In the 2003-04 recruiting cycle , CU spent just over $300,000 on football recruiting . <p> " What we have to do on campus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualifications or the potential to be successful at the university , " DiStefano said . " I do n't think that 's limited just to student-athletes ; I think it 's across the board . " <p> Robinson , the former safety , said the issue is much bigger than what happens to the football team . <p> " I think the administration has to make a conscious effort to recruit students - not athletes - students of color . That 's the only thing you can do . They need to make sure that African-American kids are as comfortable as a white kid . White kids do n't feel any pressure , any outside discomfort because there are so many people like them . I think it 's only fair that African-Americans feel the same way .
