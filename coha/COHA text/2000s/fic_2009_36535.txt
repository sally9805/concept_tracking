LONDON , MARCH 1809 <p> <br> <p> AURELIA FARNHAM INSTINCTIVELY quickened her pace as she turned onto Cavendish Square from Wigmore Street . The footsteps behind her speeded up as she did . Her heart began to beat faster . Was he following her ? More to the point , who was following her ? <p> She slowed deliberately , and the footsteps adapted . It was late afternoon , the sun sinking behind the city 's roofs and chimney pots , but the evening was by no means drawing in , and plenty of people were still around . Or at least there were on the busy streets she had just left ; the square was rather quiet , no sounds of playing children coming from behind the railings of the large central garden . <p> But Aurelia 's apprehension was giving way to annoyance . This was her home ground , and if an individual could n't feel safe a mere twenty yards from her own front door , then something was seriously rotten in the state of Denmark . <p> She stopped abruptly and spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his high-crowned beaver hat and bowed . <p> " Lady Farnham ? " he inquired , his tone slightly clipped . Aurelia gave a faint nod of acknowledgment . " Do I know you , sir ? " There was nothing in his appearance to alarm . He was dressed with impeccable respectability , carrying nothing more threatening than a slender , silverknobbed cane . <p> " Unfortunately , ma'am , we have not been formally introduced , " he said , replacing his hat . " I left my card at your house an hour past , but ... " He paused with a slight frown . " Forgive me , but I had little confidence that it would reach your hands . The ... uh ... servant to whom I entrusted it seemed disinclined to take it and did so only with the greatest reluctance . I thought I would return and try my luck again . " <p> " Ah , that would be Morecombe , " Aurelia said with something approaching a sigh . " His manner may be a little off-putting , sir , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She regarded him interrogatively . " Is there something I can do for you ? " <p> He offered another little bow . " Colonel , Sir Greville Falconer at your service , ma'am . Forgive this unconventional introduction , but I was a friend of your husband 's . " <p> " Of Frederick 's ? " Aurelia looked astonished . Her husband , First Lieutenant , Lord Frederick Farnham , had died at the Battle of Trafalgar , over three years earlier . He 'd have been a much younger man than this colonel , she reflected . Sir Greville seemed to dwarf her , towering over her , his wide shoulders filling the well-cut coat as if he had been poured into it . What she had seen of his short , dark hair was flecked with gray at the temples , and he had the unmistakable air of mature self-assurance that comes with experience and authority . <p> " Yes , of Frederick 's , " he agreed . A gust of March wind caught his hat , and he grabbed it swiftly . He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtesies , although nothing obliged her to offer hospitality to a stranger who 'd accosted her on the street . But if he had been a friend of Frederick 's , then she owed him more than the street . " Would you care to accompany me into the house , sir ? " <p> " Thank you , ma'am . " He offered her his arm . She took it with a politely nonc mmittal smile , immediately returning her hands inside her swan's-down muff . They walked the last few yards and up the steps to the front door in a silence that Aurelia found awkward , but that she was convinced her companion did not . He radiated confidence and self-possession . <p> Aurelia slipped one gloved hand from the muff and extracted a key from her reticule . The house 's owners , Prince and Princess Prokov , had decided on the line of least resistance when it came to dealings with the ancient Morecombe . He could not be relied upon to hear the door knocker , and even when he did , his progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before the door was opened to them . A modern lock had now been installed , and if the elderly retainer was on duty at the door , rather than the extremely efficient Boris , the house 's occupants took their own keys . <p> She opened the door and stepped inside , inviting her companion to follow her . <p> Morecombe shuffled in his carpet slippers from the kitchen regions , peering myopically at the pair in the hall . " Oh , ' t is you , " he declared . <p> " Yes , Morecombe , and I have a visitor , " Aurelia said patiently . " We shall go into the salon . " She turned aside into a large and beautifully furnished drawing room . " You must forgive Morecombe 's eccentricities , Sir Greville . He has been a retainer here for many , many years . " She set down her muff and drew off her gloves . <p> " Wo n't you sit down , sir . " <p> The colonel had removed his hat and was looking appreciatively around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireplace . A rather beautiful woman in full court dress looked out from the canvas , her startling blue eyes seeming to follow the room 's occupants . " A relative ? " he asked , absently brushing at his hat brim . <p> " Not of mine , " she said . " A close relative of Prince Prokov 's . The house belongs to him and his wife , a very old friend of mine . I am staying here while they 're in the country with their staff for several months . The princess awaits her confinement . " <p> " I did wonder how you came to be living here , " he observed , turning his gaze on her . A dark and unreadable gaze . <p> Aurelia was suddenly uneasy . Why would he wonder anything about her at all ? Who was he ? He was somehow giving the impression that he knew things that he had no business knowing . She had the strangest feeling that , as he looked at her , he was assessing her , comparing her with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him out of the house . <p> " Forgive me , Colonel ... it was pleasant to meet you , but I 'm afraid I have another engagement in an hour and must change my dress , " she said , moving towards the door with an ushering gesture in his direction . <p> " I understand , ma'am , and I wo n't keep you long , but I have not as yet discharged my business . " He did not move from his place before the fire . <p> Aurelia 's nostrils flared with a surge of annoyance that did nothing to dispel the unease . She turned back to the room , standing close to the door . " Indeed , sir ? " Her brown eyes had lost their habitual warmth and her fair eyebrows rose . <p> He smiled , a flash of white in a lean , tanned countenance . His eyes were a dark gray beneath thick , straight eyebrows , and disconcertingly , he had the longest , lushest eyelashes that Aurelia had ever seen on a woman , let alone a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing conventionally handsome about his appearance . His countenance had a rather battered air , as if it and its owner had been through a lot together . But it was strangely compelling nevertheless . <p> And even as she thought this , she realized that her moment of taking stock had given her visitor implicit control . She should have pressed on with his dismissal ; instead , she had looked at him far too closely for a mere casual and uninterested observation . <p> He set his hat and cane down on a console table against the wall and drew off his gloves , regarding her with a slight frown in his eyes as he slapped the gloves rhythmically into the palm of one hand . " I expected to find you in the country , at Farnham Manor , " he said , and Aurelia , to her increased annoyance , thought she could detect a note of irritation in the statement . <p> " Indeed ? " she said again in a tone of haughty indifference . " I wish you would tell me , Sir Greville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . My husband 's been dead for more than three years , it seems a little late for a visit of condolence . " <p> " Would you sit down , Lady Farnham . " <p> It was not a question , or a request , it had all the force of a command . Aurelia stared at him . He was presuming to give her orders in what for the present was to all intents and purposes her own house . " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " Believe me , ma'am , it would be better if you were to sit down , " he said , gesturing to a sofa . <p> " I have no intention of doing so , " Aurelia snapped , laying a hand on the back of a chair as if to emphasize her upright posture . " Now , state your business , Colonel , if you must , then oblige me with your departure . " <p> " Very well . " He nodded slightly . " Your husband , First Lieutenant , Lord Frederick Farnham , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed at the battle of Corunna . " <p> " You are mad , " Aurelia said , her fingers curling tightly over the chair . <p> He shook his head . " I witnessed his death , Lady Farnham . " <p> What kind of cruel practical joke was this ? Aurelia 's knees shook a little , and there was a tight band around her head . She took a step sideways and dropped onto the sofa , gazing up at her visitor in dazed incomprehension . She could n't dismiss what he 'd said . He was regarding her with both understanding and something akin to compassion , and she knew that he was telling the truth , however unbelievable it was . He had the unmistakable air of a man who knew exactly what was going to happen next and was calmly prepared to deal with it . <p> He turned away and strode to a sideboard . He filled a glass from the cognac decanter and brought it over to her . " Drink this . " <p> Aurelia took the glass in numb fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cough and splutter , but it warmed her belly and brought her back to full awareness . " I do n't understand , " she stated . <p> " No , " he agreed . " How should you ? " He returned to the sideboard and poured himself a glass of port . He came back , moved a chair slightly so that he was facing her , and sat down . " I will explain as much as I can at this juncture . Drink the cognac . " <p> Aurelia took a more cautious sip . A flickering resurgence of her customary self wanted to tell him that he had no right to help himself to port without an invitation , but she recognized the urge as merely an attempt to reestablish some kind of control over her surroundings , since she had no control over what was happening , or of what would happen next . <p> " Frederick Farnham worked for me , " her visitor announced , swirling the liquid in his glass . <p> " He was a first lieutenant in the navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colonel ... they do n't have colonels in the navy . " <p> " True , " he agreed calmly . " But there is some overlap between the services . " He gave her his white smile again . " We do all serve King George . " <p> Aurelia stared at the contents of her glass , her mind a violent swirl of incomprehension . Finally , she looked up and said as steadily as she could , articulating every syllable as if it would invest her words with truth , " I have the letter from the War Ministry ... the letter regretfully informing me that my husband had been killed at the Battle of Trafalgar . There can be no mistake ... why would the War Ministry lie to me ? If it was n't Frederick who was killed , then who was it ? " <p> " Many died in that battle , " her visitor said . " But your husband was not one of them . He was not at the battle , he was with me in Bavaria , at Ulm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Aurelia shook her head . " Why was Frederick there ? He was in the navy . " <p> " Your husband was only peripherally attached to the navy . In fact he was an agent of the secret service . " <p> " A spy , you mean ? " Aurelia struggled to attach such a label to the man she thought she knew ... the man who 'd been a childhood companion , and her husband . The man she 'd shared a bed with for close to four years . That man had been open , generous , kind . Above all , honest and honorable . He had no time for deceit or lies , even of the most trivial . Such a monumental deception as this was impossible . <p> She shook her head again , more vigorously this time . " I do n't believe a word you 're saying . " <p> Greville inclined his head in acknowledgment . " I do n't really expect you to take my word for it . But I hope you will take Frederick 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tapped it lightly against his knee , looking at her with that same slight frown in the gray eyes . " This is from your husband . It was sent to you at Farnham Manor . I went there in search of you ... Frederick assumed that you would still be there . With your daughter ... ? " He raised an interrogative eyebrow . " Frances , I believe is her name . Franny , Frederick called her ... she must be about six now ? " <p> Aurelia said nothing , just gazed at him with all the fascination of a mesmerized rabbit . <p> " Anyway , " he continued , when it seemed clear she was saying nothing , " I went in search of you and was told I would find you both here , in Cavendish Square . This "  --  he gestured with the packet  --  " was delivered to you a few days ago ... your staff were preparing to send it on here by the mail coach . " He gave a tiny shrug . " I saved them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that my staff gave you mail addressed to me without so much as a murmur ? " Aurelia demanded . It was insultingly laughable for him to expect her to swallow such a tale . <p> " I had impeccable credentials , " he said quietly . He reached again into his coat . " They recognized this ... as I 'm sure you do . " He held the object out to her on his flat palm . <p> She took it automatically and gazed at it in openmouthed incredulity . It was Frederick 's signet ring , the seal of the Farnhams embedded in the gold . She looked up and stared at Greville . " How did you get this ? " <p> " Frederick gave it to me . He thought you might need proof of my story . " A mobile eyebrow lifted . " It seems that you do . " <p> Aurelia looked at the ring again , holding it up to the shaft of fading light from the long windows . She knew it was her husband 's , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire farrago of deceit and lunacy was not a tissue of lies ? <p> " If that packet is indeed addressed to me , perhaps you should give it to me , " she declared , her words laced with sarcasm . She held out her hand imperiously . <p> The colonel did not immediately hand over the packet . " There are two things inside . One is for you , a personal communication from Frederick , the other is for the War Ministry . I can not permit you to see that , as I 'm sure you 'll understand . " <p> " Assuming I believe this lunatic story , why would Frederick send me something destined for the War Ministry ? " she inquired , the sarcasm still heavy . <p> " The situation was desperate . We were under attack , and there was considerable doubt as to whether we ould make it through . It was vital that this document reached the right hands . Frederick had the idea to send it to you ... a destination that would draw no attention . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I imagine the letter to you will explain all you need to know . " <p> Aurelia turned the packet over between her hands . The writing was definitely Frederick 's , although it was not in his usual beautiful and forceful script . The letters were untidy , the ink slightly smudged as if written in haste . As indeed he would have been if this story was true . <p> " You survived the attack , " she stated without expression . <p> " Yes , " he agreed simply . <p> " But Frederick did not , " she said softly , trying to absorb anew the knowledge of her husband 's violent death . She had grieved for his loss once , and now it seemed she must do so again . <p> " No , " her visitor said , watching her closely . " He was killed in a skirmish with half a dozen French soldiers . But by then we had entrusted the packet to an ensign to take to one of the ships in the harbor that were waiting to evacuate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the sofa and walked slowly across the room to a small satinwood secretaire that stood between two of the long windows . She took up a paper knife and slit the wafer that sealed the packet . With slow deliberation she examined the two sealed papers that it contained . One was addressed to Aurelia Farnham . No honorific , just the plain name in Frederick 's script , which , unlike the other , was clear and unhurried . He must have written the letter itself when he was not in desperate straits . <p> The second sealed paper had a simple inscription . To be delivered unopened to the War Ministry , Horseguards Parade , London . <p> She became aware of her visitor 's tall , broad form standing at her shoulder . She had n't heard his approach across the expanse of Turkey carpet ... surprising with such a big man , she thought irrelevantly . <p> " May I ? " Without waiting for permission , he twitched the second paper from her suddenly nerveless fingers and slipped it inside his coat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I am here . I suggest you read your letter . It will go much further than I can to explain what I can understand must seem like an elaborate and fantastic hoax . " <p> Aurelia turned to look at him , disliking that she had to look up to do so . " I must ask you to excuse me , Colonel . " Her voice was cold and stiff . " I would prefer to read my husband 's letter in private . " <p> " Of course . " He bowed . " I will return in the morning . There are things we must discuss . " <p> " Oh , I doubt that , sir , " she retorted . " You 've had your say , and we can have nothing further to talk about . If I 'm to believe you , the last three and a bit years of my life have been a lie . And I have you to thank for it , it seems . I have no wish to lay eyes upon you again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , that you will change your mind about that . Read your letter . I trust it will enable you to see things in a different light . " He offered another bow , then turned to the door , gathering up his hat and cane . " I will return in the morning . " He left , closing the door firmly at his back . <p> Aurelia stared at the closed door , uncertain whether she was on the verge of hysterical laughter or tears . A fit of hysteria anyway . She could n't believe what he 'd told her , and yet she knew without a shadow of doubt that it was true . The ring and the unopened letter in her hand shrieked the horrendous , unbelievable truth . <p> Frederick Farnham did not die on October 21 in the year of our Lord 1805 , he died at Corunna on January 16 , 1809 . <p> But where did that leave Cornelia 's husband , Stephen ? Viscount Dagenham had set sail with Frederick from Plymouth harbor in the early spring of 1805 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fleet . She and Cornelia had waved after the departing frigate , they had seen their husbands aboard together . And they had received official notifications of their husbands ' deaths within a few days of each other . And yet Colonel Falconer had said that Frederick had never been in the Battle of Trafalgar . At the time that naval battle was being fought , he had been in Bavaria . Bavaria , of all places . <p> She could n't for the life of her remember what was going on at Ulm in October of 1805 . Had the English been involved ? And if they had n't been , why were Colonel Falconer and Frederick Farnham there ? <p> Of course the answer was obvious . If they were spies , then they were covertly collecting information . <p> Aurelia followed the progress of this seemingly interminable conflict with the voracious tyrant NapolTon as best she could . She read the dispatches that were regularly published in the Gazette , and she listened with interest to the conversations of those who had an inside knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner table , when Harry and his friends and ministry colleagues were gathered . But information in general was scanty and sporadic , except for the great battles in which the English fought , such as Trafalgar , which were reported in detail . Reports of Moore 's gallant and horrendous retreat and stand at Corunna were only just making it to the English newspapers . But if what the colonel had told her was true , her husband 's presence there would have been covert and his death would not make it to the regularly published lists of the killed and missing . <p> Frederick . She looked down at the unopened letter in her hand . She had to open it , yet she dreaded doing so . She knew absolutely that its contents would turn her ordered existence on its head . She wanted to pretend that this afternoon had never happened , put it out of her mind completely , and simply resume her customary life with Franny , with her friends , with the conventional , gentle social round . <p> Aurelia stared unseeing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frederick had accepted as their due . Quiet , comfortable , lacking for nothing , bringing with its serene pleasures the customary obligations of privilege . A life lived by everyone they knew , lived by rules and expectations that were bred into them from birth . <p> But Frederick had not lived that life . He had pretended to do so , but he had been someone else , someone she did n't know at all . And he had been prepared to sacrifice his marriage , fatherhood , the friendships of a lifetime . His wife . And for what ? To live underground as a spy . Dead to everyone who knew him , who loved him . Had he given a thought to his wife and child when he 'd made that decision ? Had he intended to come back to her if he survived the war ? <p> A surge of hurt-fueled rage washed over Aurelia at this monumental deception her husband had practiced upon her . All the while he had been plotting his dangerous and exciting life , she had been plodding along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her death . <p> Her reluctance to open the letter vanished . It was sealed with wax imprinted with Frederick 's signet ring , which she still held tucked into her palm . She slit the wax impatiently with a fingernail and opened the sheet . Her head swam and her eyes blurred as she gazed at the sheet crammed with line after line in that flowing familiar handwriting . Her mouth was suddenly dry , and she swallowed convulsively . It was as if Frederick was in the room with her . She could see his smiling green eyes , his full mouth , the long , gangly length of him . He never looked perfectly groomed , something was always slightly awry with his attire . And if she ever pointed it out to him , he would simply laugh . She could hear that laugh now , a light , cheerfully dismissive chuckle that told her he had more important things to consider than his appearance . <p> And she knew full well now what those important things were . Not estate matters , or hunting issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country gentlemen . No , they were dangerous secrets , secrets that had led to his death . And in her hand now were his words , finally truthful words coming from beyond the grave . <p> My dearest Ellie ... <p> A childish treble in the hall made her jump , then hastily fold the letter , pushing it into the shallow pocket of her skirt . Franny was back from her schoolroom day with Stevie Dagenham at the Bonhams ' house on Mount Street . Aurelia and Cornelia had decided it made good sense for the two children to share a governess until Stevie was sent away to school . He was seven , and Cornelia was fighting a battle with his grandfather the Earl of Markby to keep him at home at least until he was ten . She had Stevie 's stepfather on her side , and Harry had made a point of ingratiating himself with the earl , so Cornelia was hopeful . The shared governess was an arrangement that suited the children and their mothers , keeping the two households in close touch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to show her something . " Franny 's insistent voice brought Aurelia back to the present reality . The letter would wait . She 'd waited for an entire marriage and three years beyond it for the truth , another hour would make no difference . She gathered her composure , painted a smile on her lips , and went to the drawing-room door . <p> " I 'm here , Franny . Have you had a pleasant day ? " <p> " Oh , so many things happened , Mama . We went to see the lions at the Exchange , and they roared an ' roared . I think Stevie was just a tiny bit frightened ... but I was n't ... not one little bit . " The little girl ran to her mother , the words tumbling from her lips . " I drew a picture of the lions ... see ... they had all this hair , Miss Alison said it 's called a mane ... " <p> Aurelia admired the picture , listened attentively to the minute-by-minute description of her daughter 's day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gently eased the child upstairs to the nursery quarters . <p> She stayed with Franny during her supper and sat by the fire as Daisy , the nurserymaid , gave her a bath , listening to the endless prattle . Not for the first time it occurred to her that Franny was an unstoppable voice and had been from her first birthday . Frederick had been astonished at his little daughter 's grasp of language ... <p> Frederick . The letter in her pocket crackled against her thigh as she made an involuntary move . Later ... there would be time enough later . <p> " What story should we read tonight , love ? " she asked cheerfully , receiving her towel-swaddled daughter into her lap . <p> Copyright 2009 by Jane Feather <br> Continues ...
