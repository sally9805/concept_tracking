Maggots move into mainstream medicine <p> Pamela Mitchell is no stranger to modern medical care . Now 52 , the former waitress from Akron , Ohio , began getting regular insulin injections at the age of 10 , after she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes . Twenty years ago , she received a life-saving kidney donation from her brother . In 2001 , Mitchell faced yet another harrowing health threat . An infected cut on her left foot had turned into a persistent , festering wound . Her doctors recommended that the foot be amputated . <p> That 's when Mitchell began lobbying for a treatment that could have been concocted by the directors of Fear Factor . She pinned her hopes on a mass of writhing , munching maggots . <p> Hospital treatment of infected wounds with maggots-specifically , blowfly larvae-dates back more than 70 years . But use of these immature insects to remove dead and infected tissue , known as maggot-debridement therapy , long languished on the periphery of accepted practice . Improvements in surgical techniques and antibiotics displaced maggot therapy , as earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see " Legit Leeches , " below ) . Earlier this year , both organisms received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to be marketed as medical devices . Neither had been strictly prohibited , but FDA 's imprimatur , as well as some recent research findings , has given long-awaited credibility to the inclusion of live organisms in the medical armamentarium . <p> In the United States , maggots have been tested for use against several types of wounds and skin ulcers . Among these are diabetic ulcers , such as the one on Mitchell 's foot , which nearly 15 percent of diabetics experience at some time . Roughly one in five of those ulcers eventually leads to limb amputation . In the United States , some 60,000 limbs per year are lost to diabetic ulcers . Another major problem that seems amenable to maggot therapy is bedsores , or pressure ulcers , which bedridden patients commonly develop . Sores increase both the length and cost of hospital stays . The most severe bedsores can lead to fatal complications . <p> In Europe and Israel , researchers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traumatic injuries , and infections by flesh-eating bacteria . In all these conditions , removal of the dying tissue encourages healing . <p> While most U.S. medical institutions do n't use maggot therapy , " more and more people recognize it as a viable option , " says geriatric nurse practitioner Courtney Lyder of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville . He predicts that maggots will eventually rank second only to the scalpel in debridement , eclipsing tools he has analyzed in medical review articles , such as tissue-consuming enzymes . In some cases , maggot therapy may even be superior to surgery , Lyder says . <p> MAGGOTS MAKE THE CUT Three years ago , as Mitchell 's foot festered , scalpels and topical medications held sway in wound care . Her physicians cut away infected tissue-including the tips of two toes-and administered antibiotics , but those treatments did n't halt the spread of infection . Next , the surgeons told her that they would need to remove the entire foot . <p> " If I 'd listened to them , I 'd be in a wheelchair right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy on a television show , Mitchell urged her caregivers , including Akron-based dermatologist Eliot Mostow , to give the insects a chance . <p> Mostow , a faculty member of Northeast Ohio Universities College of Medicine , had used maggots therapeutically once before . He initially told Mitchell that her infection was too severe for maggot treatment , but when she remained adamant , he acquiesced . <p> He placed an order with pathologist Ronald A. Sherman of the University of California , Irvine , who raises , studies , and sells blowfly ( Phaenicia sericata ) maggots for medical purposes . Eggs of that species can be disinfected before they hatch into maggots . Just as important , the immature flies eat only dead and dying , or necrotic , tissue , which they break down by excreting digestive enzymes that do n't harm healthy skin and bone . <p> Using a bandage , Mostow trapped the sterilized larvae in Mitchell 's wound and let them feed for 2 days . After a series of treatments with fresh maggots over a period of weeks , Mitchell 's wound was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " says Mostow , who has since used maggots on several other patients . " Maggots do a phenomenal job of cleaning out dead tissue in portions of a wound where your curette or scalpel blade ca n't go . " <p> But some patients find the procedure repulsive , Mostow says . When applied to the wound , day-old larvae are a millimeter or two long , but they grow to about a centimeter within a few days . The emerging larvae " are like Rice Krispy kernels , only oozing and falling all over each other , " he says . <p> In Europe , where maggots are more widely used , some physicians place the larvae in permeable , plastic or nylon envelopes the size of tea bags . Enzymes and digested tissues can flow back and forth , while the growing maggots stay out of sight . <p> Mitchell still has her foot , and only a small scar to show for her ordeal . She now occasionally lectures doctors and nurses on maggot therapy and serves on the board of directors of the BioTherapeutics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to promote the study and use of maggots , leeches , and other living animals , including bees and pets , in medical care . This year , it began marketing " Medical Maggots . " <p> IMMORTAL WOUNDS Sherman is just the latest champion of maggots in medicine . Military surgeons of the Renaissance and in Napoleon 's armies noted that wounds that became infested with maggots healed quickly and resulted in relatively few deaths or complications from infections . During the U.S. Civil War , at least one Confederate doctor applied maggots to soldiers ' wounds . But the practice did n't leave the battlefield until after World War I. <p> In France in 1917 , William Baer of Johns Hopkins University treated two gravely wounded American soldiers who , for a week , had lain unattended and unable to move in the contested turf between enemy lines . Maggots swarmed over the men 's injuries , but beneath the larvae , the surgeon found surprisingly healthy tissue . <p> Baer was sufficiently impressed that , after returning to Baltimore , he used maggots to treat 21 non-military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posthumously in 1931 , maggots took hold in the medical community . By 1934 , more than 1,000 surgeons in North America and Europe were using maggot-debridement therapy for a variety of wounds . <p> From the 1940s onward , however , improved surgical techniques for debriding wounds and the advent of antibiotics contributed to the decline of maggot therapy , says Sherman . By the final quarter of the 20th century , the practice was nearly forgotten . <p> Sherman , one of the few physicians who kept maggot therapy from disappearing in the United States , has spent more than 20 years researching the treatment of skin ulcers with blowfly larvae . <p> In 1990 , Sherman began a study of the safety and effectiveness of using maggots in patients with persistent pressure ulcers . He followed 103 candidates for maggot therapy that were referred to him over the next 5 years . <p> Some patients did not receive maggot therapy because they , their family members or their primary physicians rejected the idea or because their wounds responded satisfactorily to conventional treatments . Others simultaneously received maggot therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sherman collected data on 92 pressure ulcers-some as large as a business card-in 67 patients . Of these wounds , 49 were treated with conventional means alone and 43 were treated with maggots either alone or with conventional therapy . <p> During the first month of treatment , 79 percent of the wounds treated with maggots decreased in surface area , and the average area of dead or dying tissue fell by a third . In wounds that did n't receive the maggots ' ministrations , only 44 percent shrank within the first month and there was no overall change in necrotic area . Within 5 months , 39 percent of the maggot-debrided wounds had healed completely , whereas only 21 percent of the others did so . Sherman reported these findings in 2002 . <p> Sherman performed a separate evaluation of maggot therapy for treating patients with diabetic foot ulcers . He examined 20 such wounds in 18 patients , whom he treated between 1990 and 1995 . These wounds received maggot therapy , conventional surgical and topical procedures , or both approaches . <p> His results , reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . During the first 2 weeks of maggot therapy , sometimes combined with conventional treatment , the average percentage of each wound covered by necrotic tissue fell markedly , and 36 percent of those wounds ultimately closed completely . Conventional therapy had no significant effect on the necrotic area during the first 2 weeks , and only 21 percent of the conventionally treated wounds ultimately healed fully . <p> Maggot therapy may carry yet another advantage . Among 10 deep wounds that were cleaned by maggots before surgical repair , there were no postoperative infections . But there were six infections among 19 similar wounds that were not exposed to maggots , Sherman and Kathleen Shimoda of Veterans Affairs Long Beach Healthcare System in California report in the Oct. 1 Clinical Infectious Diseases . <p> While few other researchers in the United States have reported data on maggot therapy , several teams in Europe and Israel have been studying the use of the larvae during the past decade . A few studies have reported that some patients with painful skin wounds experience an intensification of pain during maggot treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as effective , and possibly less expensive , than conventional therapy for infected skin wounds . <p> A decade ago , Sherman estimates , at most 20 vials of maggots were used in North America each year , excluding those he used himself . Last year , he shipped about 1,000 vials to U.S. doctors . Maggots , Sherman says , " have found their way back into the hearts and minds of many clinicians , and into the wounds of many patients . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SQUIRMING SURGEONS . Hungry blowfly maggots can outperform surgeons in cleaning certain infected wounds . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : VIAL CREATURES . From his maggot lab in Irvine , Calif. , Ronald Sherman has shipped blowfly larvae to more than 300 doctors . <p> By Ben Harder <p> Legit Leeches Wriggling , biting , vein-imitating worms are back in vogue but face competition <p> Leeches have developed a long rsum of medical employment in 2,500 or more years that doctors have been using them . In fact , the most widely used species is named Hirudo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors has declined from its mid-19th-century peak , when France alone used as many as 30 million per year , medical historians estimate . A decision last June by the Food and Drug Administration , which cleared the way for more companies to sell medical leeches in the United States , is one indication that the organisms are making a comeback in the clinic . Companies that had sold leeches before FDA began regulating them 30 years ago were permitted to keep supplying the animals for medicinal use . A prevalent current use of leeches is for treatment of a circulatory complication that 's common after reconstructive surgeries . Known as venous congestion , it occurs when slow-healing veins are unable to draw blood away from a surgical site at an adequate pace . Blood flow stagnates , robbing the healing tissue of critical oxygen . <p> Leeches restore circulation by , in effect , acting as surrogate veins until the real vessels heal enough to take over . <p> " They withdraw blood and simultaneously inject a blood thinner and anticoagulant into the wound , " says surgeon Nadine Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady bleeding from the wound , which relieves venous congestion . <p> However , because each leech feeds for only an hour or so , a typical patient can require more than 200 animals during the week that treatment can last . The leeches cost little , but applying and monitoring them take time and effort . If the animals are n't watched , they may feed on healthy tissue rather than at the location where they are needed , or they may drop off . <p> " Also , there 's a potential for infection , " Connor says . To digest blood , leeches ' guts contain certain bacteria of the genus Aeromonas , and those microbes occasionally infect people . " With infection , the success rate of salvaging grafted or reattached tissue goes down from about 80 percent to less than 30 percent , " Connor says . Occasionally , the infection itself leads to serious complications . <p> Connor and her colleagues now are developing a device that can improve on the leech 's useful function . Their cup-size contraption continually bathes the wound with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wound . <p> For a head-to-head test against leeches , the researchers simulated a skin-graft operation on each of 11 pigs . Six of the skin flaps were treated with up to three devices simultaneously . The rest each got 15 five-leech teams that worked consecutive 1-hour shifts . Both 15-hour treatments extracted the same small volume of congested blood , but subsequent examination of the skin flaps suggested that mild venous congestion occurred in all five of those treated by leeches and only two of the device-treated flaps . <p> The researchers reported their findings in the November 2003 Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery . Connor says the device needs improvements but could be ready for testing in people within 2 years . <p> Even if leeches do someday lose their wound-repairing jobs , they have other medical talents to peddle . For example , their saliva harbors a still-unidentified agent that dulls pain , which is why their bites often cause no sensation . That has inspired researchers in Essen , Germany , to investigate leeches for relieving pain in osteoarthritic knees . <p> Preliminary observations indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsequent week than do daily applications of a standard anti-inflammatory gel . Patients receiving the leech treatment also experienced freer movement and less stiffness in the knee , Andreas Michalsen of the Essen-Mitte Clinics and his colleagues reported in the Nov. 4 , 2003 Annals of Internal Medicine . <p> The use of leeches to manage localized pain dates back to ancient times . If further research supports the findings from Germany , it might become increasingly common in the future as well . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : FIRST TO DRAW BLOOD .
