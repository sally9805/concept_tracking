For many expectant parents , nine months is just too long . Not willing to wait for the birth of their child and the accompanying flash photos , parents-to-be are shelling out $200 and more to ultrasound centers with cutesy names like Prenatal Peek and Womb with a View for high-res , golden-hued ultrasound images of fetuses in their amniotic homes . It 's not hard to see the appeal . The latest advances in ultrasound technology  --  from grainy 2D to glorious 4D with accompanying DVD  --  produce images that are impressive , showing facial features , hair , fingers , toes and even a fetus ' sex . Some companies throw in a sound track to go with Baby 's first video . <P> But there may be risks . The FDA issued a firm warning earlier this year in its consumer magazine . Although there are no reported cases of ultrasound causing harm to a fetus , the FDA SAYS we simply do n't know enough about the long-term effects of repeatedly sending high doses of energy across a mother 's womb .

Laboratory studies have shown that even at low levels , ultrasounds can produce physical effects in tissue , including jarring vibrations and temperature increases . John Hayes , editor in chief of Diagnostic Imaging Magazine , is concerned that entertainment ultrasounds may give parents a false sense of security . He is troubled by the fact that some expectant mothers are forgoing standard prenatal visits after a " reassuring " visit to an ultrasound center . <P> None of that has slowed the spread of ultrasound-imaging machines . The devices , which can cost as much as $200,000 , are even popping up in the offices of obstetricians eager to please patients who expect to get the same services from their doctors that they can buy in a shopping mall . <P> If you really want a prenatal keepsake , the risks of getting just one are probably pretty low . But first clear it with your doctor . Then limit your exposure to 20 min. or less , and make sure that whoever performs the procedure is a trained sonographer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised .  --  With reporting by A.
