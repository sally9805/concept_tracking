The Fool 's Tale A Novel Chapter One Enemies May Day , 1198 Sabel was old for a bride , nearly twenty , and orphaned with little dowry beyond her bloodline . She was considered a great beauty in her own country  --  small and boyish in build , with an intelligent , squarish face and a high , graceful forehead  --  and supremely desirable for her education , skills , and absolute lack of feminine triviality . But she had always known she 'd be married for politics . It never bothered her ; until she 'd heard Chrtien de Troyes 's romances of Lancelot and the Round Table , at the age of thirteen , it had never even occurred to her that there could be other reasons to bind herself to a man . She remembered Adle chasing away the minstrel reciting them , then chastising Isabel for corrupting her own wits and sense . So she had never dwelt on the possibility of romantic love . But she 'd assumed a match would at least be within her own race , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitor 's identity : not only a Welsh prince , but the only prince still referred to by the English chroniclers as " Rex "  --  King . A small kingdom , and a poor one , but she would be a queen . And the king , when she 'd met him , was so disarming and handsome and his accent so melodious that it had made her knees weak , although she was hardly the sort to get weak knees . When the date was set and the terms agreed upon , she had spent a fortnight smiling to herself . But that smile waned on the journey to a land that was far too alien , considering it began almost at her childhood doorstep . They had left the homey fields of England for windy Welsh hillsides , hillsides carpeted by dead bracken that looked like russet snow , and nothing else for miles at a stretch but grass and prickly gorse  --  not a tree , not a house , not even a rocky outcrop to vary the landscape . Nothing but herds of white sheep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The songbirds had been cacophonous , magpies and curlews , red kites and buzzards perched on the skeletons of sheep that had not survived the winter . In England there had been farmers , already sowing , bowing respectfully as they passed ; here they 'd found undernourished peasants digging up peat under the damp grey sky and pointedly ignoring them . Isabel tried not to be disheartened by this ; she hoped she could eventually make these people understand that not all Normans were butchers . Below them , the valleys and lower hillsides were impassable bogs shadowed by dense groves of scrub oak ( considered by the natives sacred and haunted ) , so the ancient Roman roads had kept them high on the slopes , windblown , chilly and exposed . She had known it would be highland , and she 'd thought that meant mountains , which would have at least been interesting . The first few hills had been promising , with lovely sweeping views of river valleys , but by the time they were well into the kingdom , the entire country was high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no peaks to speak of anywhere . It looked , her brother Thomas had muttered , like the English moors flung over a gigantic bowl of lumpy porridge . Wigmore Castle was only a day 's ride off but in that day she had been transported farther away than her pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela had taken her . Gwirion had been incensed when he 'd learned the wedding was set for May Day , and the Spring Rites canceled because of it . ( " Usurped , " he 'd protested , " by a Mortimer , by a bitch of an English virgin . " ) When the king warned him not to use this public gathering as a chance to make sport of anybody , Gwirion had rebutted that he would never condescend to dignify the occasion by immortalizing it with a prank of any sort . And so the entire castle population knew there would be trouble . It was May Day at last . Boughs of birch twigs hung over windows and everyone wore brilliant colors  --  even the usually bedraggled dwarf Corr wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Gwirion , who had donned sackcloth to mourn the end of the king 's finest years as a bachelor . He insisted the day was too splendid to waste on a wedding , particularly one involving Mortimers , and would have avoided it altogether if Corr had not begged him otherwise . " You know how ladies react when they see me for the first time , " he lamented , his colorless lashes blinking almost spastically in the sunlight . " If you 're beside me I can pretend to myself it 's partly your hideous mug . " Gwirion grinned at this and then a thoughtful gleam warmed his eyes . It was a look Corr was all too familiar with . " Whatever you are thinking of thinking , " he said , " do n't think it . " " It seems to me , " Gwirion mused , ignoring the request , " that we 've never fully exploited that particular aspect of your appearance . " " I doubt she 'll give us much satisfaction that way . I 've heard she has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But what has she got on the rest of her ? " he asked . Rhetorically . Corr sighed in capitulation . " And how severe a whipping will this be bringing us ? " Gwirion lowered his voice even though they were yards above the crowd . " This wedding is an invasion . She 'll try to coerce us to join her Norman civilization . " A loaded pause , and then he grinned . " If we 're expected to become like her , why do n't we just become her ? " The two of them stood atop the king 's tower , watching people mill about in anticipatory disarray around the ashes of the Beltane bonfires in the courtyard below . They descended the wooden stairs that hugged the stone curtain wall , bickering over the details of their plot , and began to scout for the bride 's brother . He was a younger brother , named Thomas , and he was hardly in whiskers . Gwirion discovered him by the stables . The Fool 's Tale       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
