Chapter One I saw him frantically waving the white flag , a man admitting defeat . As I pulled the cruiser into one of the alley 's parking spaces , blocking a silver Mercedes S500 , I realized that the banner was , in fact , a napkin . He wore a solid wall of white , the hem of a long , stained apron brushing his white jeans midshin . Though it was night , I could see a face covered with moisture . Not a surprise because the air was a chilly mist : typical May-gloom weather in L.A. I radioed my whereabouts to the dispatcher and got out , my right hand on my baton , the other swinging freely at my side . The alley stank of garbage , the odor emanating from the trash bins behind the restaurant . The flies , normally shy in the dark , were having a field day . The rear area of The Tango was illuminated by a strong yellow spotlight above the back door . The man in white was short , five-seven at the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache , and hands flapping randomly . He was agitated , talking bullet-speed Spanish . I picked up a few words , but did n't ask him to stop and translate , because I heard the noise myself-the highpitched wails of a baby . " Where ? " I yelled over his words . " Dnde ? " " Aqu , aqu ! " He was pointing to an army-green Dumpster filled to the brim with blue plastic refuse bags . " Call 911 . " I ran to the site and pulled out several bags , tearing one open and exposing myself to a slop of wilted salad greens , mushy vegetables , and golf balls of gray meat and congealed fat . As I sifted through the trash , my clean , pressed uniform and I became performance art , the deep blue cloth soaking up the oils and stains of previously pricey edibles . " I need help ! Necesito ayuda ! Ahorita . " " S , s ! " He dashed back inside . The crying was getting louder and that was good , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My heart was slamming against my chest as I sorted through the top layer of bags . The bin was deep . I needed to jump inside to remove all the bags , but I did n't want to step on anything until I had checked it out . Three men came running out of the back door . " Escalera ! " -a ladder-I barked . " Yo necisito una escalera . " One went back inside , the other two began pulling out bags . " Careful , careful ! " I screamed . " I do n't know where it is ! " I used the word " it " because it could have been a thrown-away kitten . When agitated , felines sound like babies . But all of us knew it was n't a cat . Finally , the ladder appeared and I scurried up the steps , gingerly removing enough bags until I could see the bottom , a disc of dirty metal under the beam of my flashlight . I went over legs first and , holding the rim with my hands , lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random , checked inside , then hoisted it over the top when I satisfied myself that it did n't contain the source of the noise . Slow , Cindy , I told myself . Do n't want to mess this up . With each bag removed , I could hear myself getting closer to the sound 's origin . Someone had taken the time to bury it . Fury welled inside me , but I held it at bay to do a job . At the bottom layer , I hit pay dirt-a newborn girl with the cord still attached to her navel , her face and body filthy , her eyes scrunched up , her cries strong and tearless . I yelled out for something to wrap her in , and they handed me a fresh , starched tablecloth . I wiped down the body , cleaned out the mouth and nose as best as I could , and bundled her up-umbilicus and all . I held her up so someone could take her from me . Then I hoisted myself up and out . The man who had flagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down my hands and face . I asked him his name . " Martino Delacruz . " " Good job , Seor Delacruz ! " I smiled at him . " Buen trabajo . " The man 's eyes were wet . Moments later , the bundle was passed back to me . I felt grubby holding her , but obviously since I was the only woman in the crowd , I was supposed to know about these kinds of things . Actually , I did know a thing or two about infants , having a half sister eighteen years my junior . Her mother , Rina-my stepmother - had become very ill after childbirth and guess who stepped up to the plate when my father was in a near state of collapse ? ( Who could have blamed him ? Rina almost died . ) The positive side was the sisterly bonding , at least on my part . Hannah Rosie Decker was my only blood sibling , and they did n't come any cuter or better than she . I adored her . Matter of fact , I liked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great kids and I loved them and respected them as much as anyone could love and respect step-relatives . Rina took wonderful care of my father , a feat worth noting because Dad was not the easiest person to get along with . I knew this from firsthand experience . " Did anyone call 911 ? " " Yo hable . " Delacruz handed me another clean rag to wipe my dirty face . " Thank you , seor . " I had put a clean napkin over my shoulder and was rocking the baby against my chest . " If you can , get some warm sugar water and dunk a clean napkin into it . Then bring it to me . " The man was off in a flash . The baby 's cries had quieted to soft sobs . I suddenly noticed that my own cheeks were warm and wet , thrilled that this incident had resolved positively . Delacruz was back with the sugar water-soaked napkin . I took it and put the tip of a corner into her mouth . Immediately , she sucked greedily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got to get you to the hospital , little one . You 're one heck of a strong pup , are n't you ? " I smelled as overripe as rotten fruit . I placed the infant back into Delacruz 's arms . " Por favor , give her to the ambulance people . I need to wash my hands . " He took the bundle and began to walk with her . It was one of those Kodak moments , this macho man cooing in Spanish to this tiny , displaced infant . The job had its heartbreak , but it also had its rewards . After rotating my shoulders to release the tension , I went through the back door of The Tango and asked one of the dishwashers where I could clean up . I heard a gasp and turned around . A man wearing a toque was shooing me away with dismissive hands . " Zis is a food establishment ! You can not come in here like zat ! " " Someone dumped a baby in the trash outside . " My stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by opening up fifteen bags of garbage . I need to wash my hands ! " Toque was confused . " Here ? A bb ? " " Yes , sir ! Here ! A bb ! " I spotted a cloud of suds that had filled up a sink . Wordlessly , I walked over and plunged my hands inside very warm water . What the heck ! All the china went into a dishwasher anyway , right ? After ridding my hands of the grime , I ran the cold water full blast and washed my face . One of the kitchen workers was nice enough to offer me a clean towel . I dried myself off and looked up . The ambulance had arrived , red strobe lights pulsing through the windows . I pointed to Mr. Toque and gave him my steely-eyed look . " Like heartburn , I 'll be back . Do n't go anywhere . " The EMTs had already cut the cord and were cleaning her up . I regarded the medics as they did their job . A sturdy black woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid with a consumptive complexion was carefully wiping down the infant 's face . Both were gloved . " How 's she doing ? " I asked . They looked up . The thin kid smiled when he saw me . " Whew , you musta been hungry . " The kid 's name tag said B. HANOVER . I gave him a hard stare and he recoiled . " Jeez . Just trying out a little levity , Officer . It breaks the tension . " " How 's she doing ? " I repeated . The woman answered . Her name was Y. Crumack . " Fine , so far ... a success story . " " That 's always nice . " The infant 's placenta had been bagged and was resting on the ground a couple of feet away . It would be taken to a pathology lab , the tissue examined for disease and genetic material that might identify her . For no good reason , I picked up the bag . Crumack said , " We 'll need that . It has to be biopsied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you taking her ? " " Mid-City Pediatric Hospital . " " The one on Vermont , " I said . " Only one I know , " Hanover said . " Any ideas about the mom ? " " Not a clue . " " You should find her , " Hanover informed me . " It would help everyone out . " " Wow , I had n't thought about that , " I snapped . " Thanks for sharing . " " No need to get testy , " Hanover sneered . Crumack opened the back door , strapping the baby in an infant seat . The wailing had returned . I assumed that to be a positive sign . I gave her the bagged placenta and she placed it in the ambulance . " She sounds hungry , " I said . " Starved , " Crumack answered . " Her abdomen is empty . " " Her head looks ... I do n't know ... elongated , maybe ? What 's that all about ? " " Probably from being pushed out of the birth canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was real lucky , considering all the things that could have gone wrong . She could 've swallowed something and choked ; she could 've suffocated ; she could 've been crushed . This is an A-one outcome . " She patted my shoulder . " And you 're part of it . " I felt my eyes water . " Hey , do n't look at me , thank Seor Delacruz , " I told her . " He 's got good ears . " The man knew enough English to recognize a compliment . His smile was broad . " Any idea how many hours she 's been alive ? " I asked the techs . Hanover said , " Her body temperature has n't dropped that much . Of course , she was insulated in all that garbage . I 'd say a fairly recent dump . " " So what are we talking about ? " I asked . " Two hours ? Four hours ? " " Maybe , " Crumack said . " Six hours , max . " I checked my watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four or five in the afternoon ? " " Sounds about right . " Crumack turned to his partner . " Let 's go . " I called out , " Mid-City Pediatric ! " Hanover reconfirmed it , slid behind the wheel , and shut the door , moving on out with sirens blaring and lights blazing . My arms felt incredibly empty . Although I rarely thought about my biological clock-I was only twenty-eight-I was suddenly pricked by maternal pangs . It felt good to give comfort . Long ago , that was my primary reason for becoming a cop . The clincher was my father , of course . He had discouraged me from entering the profession . Being the ridiculously stubborn daughter I was , his caveats had the opposite effect . There were taut moments between us , but most of that had been resolved . I truly loved being a cop and not because I had unresolved Freudian needs . Still , if I had been sired by a " psychologist dad " instead of a " lieutenant dad , " I probably would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt and called the dispatcher , requesting a detective to the scene .
