A change is in order . In the past eight years the American people have built and fueled a miracle : the greatest economic engine in the history of the world . Income up , standard of living up , investment up . The deficit has become a surplus . We are fat and almost happy . Once Rabbit was rich ; now Rabbit is rolling , with a Rolex , with a Beemer and a Benz . <P> It happened once before in our time : the years 1983 to 1989 marked the greatest peacetime economic expansion to that point in all of U.S. history . President Reagan took steps that encouraged growth , and while the American people produced it , he directed the rollback of communism , the fall of the Wall . By the end , an amazing thing : a more just and peaceful world , with America known not as a bully but as a friend to freedom in the world . <P> What have Clinton-Gore done in eight years ? Have they inspired us , made us proud , done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vision ? <P> Sadly , no . They 've dithered and ducked , coasted and claimed . They squandered their opportunities to create a coherent American agenda in the world . They failed to make us safer from nuclear , chemical or biological attack . Domestically their attitude came down to this : Reform the entitlements ? We 'd rather go to a fund raiser . Bring new life to dead schools ? Rather go to Hollywood . Our children are poisoned by a sour , searing culture ? Let them eat something else . Let them eat cake . Clinton and Gore have been unserious in their stewardship . What most characterized their two terms was summed up by the Vice President in famous words : " No controlling legal authority . " <P> The scandals have been as humiliating for our great republic as they have been historic in scope and size . Filegate , Travelgate , hidden e-mails , lying under oath , hell to pay , abuse of the FBI , of the personnel system ; a health-care task force that violated federal law ; grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bimbos , coffees , lies . Most terribly , foreign agents carrying cash meet with our President in the Oval Office ; they stand in their shiny shoes on the great seal of the United States and later receive what they want : military technology . As a result , China now has weaponry that one day , perhaps , may be used against your children and mine . If there were a word in English that stood for " the shame we feel for others who should feel shame and do n't , " that word would be their legacy , the big vivid thing that they gave us . <P> A change is in order . We have Gore , whose victory would represent an endorsement of the Clintonian ethos . And we have Bush , who asks , " Where 's the wisdom in America ? I believe it 's with the people . I trust the people . " Those are the simple words of a common man who has been lucky in life  --  who made the most of his chances , made his mistakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to trust him . The trust spread within him and became a habit ; in time it gave shape to his policies .
