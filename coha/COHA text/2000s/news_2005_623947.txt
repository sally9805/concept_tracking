<p> Street walking  --  called the oldest profession  --  has somehow been transformed into an extreme sport . Ask Haight-Ashbury 's Larry Burgheimer , who has walked every street in San Francisco . Or Jeff Ingram , whose street walk was " 75 percent complete " at last check . I 'm halfway there myself . And the Castro 's Dinah Sanders says she 's perambulated 15 percent of the city 's streets . <p> Since starting my quest in 2002 to walk every street in San Francisco , I 've heard from others who have done their hometowns , too : People around the world , from Amsterdam to New Zealand , are walking every street on the map . <p> Francine Corcoran finished Minneapolis in July . <p> Joseph Terwilliger did Manhattan twice , once in 2002 and again in January . Caleb Smith was walking all the streets of Manhattan around the same time . He finished last December . Meanwhile , Paul Ashton polished off Christchurch , New Zealand , in October 2004 . <p> And for three years , 91-year-old Alan Waddell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolyn Affleck 's been doing the same thing in Vancouver , British Columbia . <p> Although obsessive-compulsive street walking is experiencing a surge in popularity , people have been doing it for years . <p> Cmdr. Thomas J. Keane finished walking every street , avenue and alley on Manhattan 51 years ago . It took the naval officer four years to cover 3,022 city blocks , according to the Dec. 15 , 1954 , New York Times . <p> Twenty-nine-year-old Phyllis Pearsall covered London 's 23,000 streets on foot in a year in 1935 . She walked 3,000 miles , charting her progress while mapping every street . Pearsall , a writer and painter at the time , later founded Britain 's A-Z Map Co . <p> The Internet and e-mail have brought many of these pavement-pounding eccentrics together . Some of them keep in touch with one another , like an informal support group . What started as a simple exercise routine for most of them gradually evolved into something more  --  something wonderfully demanding that captured their imagination and compelled them to see more , do more and learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Larry Burgheimer , 67 , a retired industrial engineer , was 28 when he started walking the streets of San Francisco . He finished his 850-mile pilgrimage in ' 72 . <p> " It took me five years to walk all of the streets and alleys , " Burgheimer says . <p> He started in 1967 , during the Summer of Love . <p> " I was mugged once and ran away on a second encounter , " Burgheimer recalls with a certain humility . He was chased several times by stray dogs in Bernal Heights . As a reminder of his glory days , he kept the shredded pair of Bermuda shorts that he wore on every hike . The only area of town he missed was the Hunters Point Naval Shipyards , which was off limits . Burgheimer finished his walk the year Nixon beat McGovern , the year Watergate forever changed our political landscape . He hopscotched around the 47-square-mile city , hiking about 5 miles at a time on weekends . His original intention , he says , was simply to get some exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frayed street map retraced in red , I 've logged 600 miles on concrete and asphalt . It has taken its toll . I 've been hobbled since March because of a torn tendon in my right foot . Walking all 2,283 streets of San Francisco does have its risks . <p> I 've learned more in the past three years about my hometown than I could have hoped to in a lifetime . I 've walked by the spot where Mark Twain gave his first lecture , where John Muir first stepped off the boat , the corner where Jack London was born , where streets are still paved with cobblestones , where Joe DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe , where the Beatles gave their last concert , where Robin Williams lives and the place where Houdini performed his famous " escape from the straitjacket while in midair . " You see it all , close up , when you walk the streets , even though you might not know it at the time . <p> It took Francine Corcoran , 55 , three years to cover all 1,071 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator at College of St. Catherine , started her walk in January 2002 . On every walk she stopped to admire something . " I love seeing new places , new landscaping , home improvements , yard art , the city 's forest , the Mississippi River , the University of Minnesota , and how much the city is changing and staying the same every minute . " <p> Covering Minneapolis ' 55 square miles on foot was an intense learning exercise . <p> " I really know my city geography now , " she says . " I know that everybody truly does live in a neighborhood . I know the flat-out best view of the Minneapolis skyline . I know where people live , and how they live  --  from the outside , anyway , and by looking in their lighted windows at night . I know where the simplest and most elegant stained-glass windows are , where the best Zen garden is , where the squirrels are getting in the eaves , and I know what real estate goes for . " <p> At first , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is an architecture photographer urged her to see it all . " And he was right , " she said . <p> Her plan to walk the more unpredictable neighborhoods in lousy weather  --  <p> " in sleet , rain , bitter cold  --  worked like a charm . " She walked every street unruffled . Sometimes , when the temperature dipped down to minus 20 degrees , she 'd wear her black knee-high mukluks ; a shin-length hooded , down-filled coat ; choppers ( leather mittens with liners ) ; and earmuffs . Under all this , she 'd have her Gore-Tex pants tucked into the mukluks , long underwear , long pants , turtleneck , scarf , thin gloves and heavy Smartwool socks . <p> " I carried my water bottle upside down in my coat pocket , " she says , " so the spigot would n't freeze . " The experience was unforgettable . <p> " I always loved Minneapolis , " she says . " Now I know why . " <p> Joseph D. Terwilliger 's first walk , which covered " every block of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , " took a year . The last one took less than 80 days . Terwilliger , 39 , an associate professor in human genetics at Columbia University and a freelance tuba player , says his most shocking discovery so far on his 1,279-mile walk through the Bronx and Manhattan has been " the variation in the prices of Dunkin ' Donuts in different neighborhoods . " <p> When he started , he weighed 250 pounds and had a 40-inch waist . Along the way he lost 60 pounds , which was part of the reason for his walk . To finish Manhattan 's 34 square miles in less than three months , he averaged 15 to 20 miles a day . A year ago today , on his longest walk , he logged 72,351 steps  --  <p> 48 miles . Now he 's walking the Bronx , which he says " has undergone an amazing renaissance since Jimmy Carter compared it to the slums of Beirut . " <p> He ran into four friends on his walks . " All trombone players , " he notes , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods , from Harlem to the Village . " <p> Caleb Smith , 35 , took 2 1/2 years to walk all 500 miles of the streets in Manhattan . <p> Smith , who was written up in both the New Yorker and Reader 's Digest , says , " Manhattan is pretty unique because it 's surrounded by water and densely packed with cool architecture , history and people . <p> " San Francisco 's peninsula , " he says with that certain air of New York snobbery , " seems like the best U.S. city to walk after Manhattan . " <p> Smith , a librarian at Columbia University , particularly enjoyed visiting little-known historic places . <p> " Some , " he says , " are marked with plaques , like the site of the Revolutionary War battle of Harlem and the Triangle Shirtwaist fire ... and some are not , like the subway grate where Marilyn Monroe 's skirt billowed , and the hotel members of the Who were kicked out of in April 1968 for blowing up the toilet in their room . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It has to be one of the most architecturally beautiful ' ghettos ' in America . Every street corner has a story . It 's just a matter of figuring out what it is . " <p> Even though Paul Ashton had lived in Christchurch , New Zealand , most of his life , he realized while walking it just how much of the city he had never seen , even within a few blocks of his home and work . Ashton , 41 , a software developer , started his walk in September 2001 . <p> There were quite a few surprises , he recalls , such as the number of streams and rivers within city limits , the wild little pockets that were n't evident on maps , the funny little hillside shelters and the quaint passageways through some of the older suburbs . " I had n't realized how many cemeteries there were in the city , " he said , " and of course I had to walk all of the roads and paths within them all . " <p> According to the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of streets . <p> Ashton finished the main part of his walk about a year ago . " These days , " he says " I am in maintenance mode  --  making occasional checks on new subdivisions . " <p> Ninety-one-year-old Alan Waddell has developed quite a following on his formidable walk through the streets of 670-square-mile Sydney . <p> When his wife of 60 years died in November 2002 , Waddell started walking the streets of his neighborhood . Then his suburb . In the intervening years , the retired accountant has walked every street , lane , bush track and stairway in 187 Sydney suburbs . " It was n't planned , " he says . " It just happened . " <p> With aneurysms in both legs that prevent the normal flow of blood through his arteries , he asked a cardiologist whether he should continue walking . " You must keep walking , " the cardiologist told him , " but rest a little every seven or eight minutes to let the blood catch up . " According to his pedometer , he has walked more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in newspapers and magazines , and his son maintains a popular Web site ( **25;4905;TOOLONG ) that logs his progress . <p> " The experience has been more than just enjoyable , " Waddell says . He has received hundreds of e-mails from people around the world saying that they have been inspired to get out and walk because of his example . " I 'm your best fan and I want to be like you , " wrote M. Contra , " but it will take a while because I 'm only 11 . " <p> When I first wrote about my goal of walking the labyrinth of streets in San Francisco , a Chronicle reader predicted that I 'd get mugged at least 11 times , accidentally step on a passed-out homeless person 17 times and have the smell of human urine constantly filling my nostrils . " By the time you 're 50 percent finished with walking the streets of the city , " he wrote , " you 'll wonder why anyone would call this a beautiful place to live . " <p> Now that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's streets , I can tell you those are n't the images that come to mind . Cities like San Francisco are living organisms . Dynamic , thriving , decaying , dying  --  all at the same time . It 's part of the human condition . Part of the mosaic . Homelessness and crime here are undeniable . But so is the fact that San Franciscans live in one of the most beautiful , progressive and tolerant cities in the world . <p> Herb Caen once wrote : " It 's the indescribable conglomeration of beauty and ugliness that makes San Francisco a poem without meter , a symphony without harmony , a painting without reason  --  a city without equal . " Walking its streets reveals this truth . It 's no surprise that other cities  --  like New York , London , Sydney and Minneapolis  --  offer similar realities . City streets are a time capsule that take us back in history , give us a glimpse of the future and help us capture the moment . They provide context  --  a place where we can put our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we once were , what we 've become and what the future might hold .
