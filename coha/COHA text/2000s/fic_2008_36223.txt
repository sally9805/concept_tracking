It might have been the suffocating heat that had Miss Sarah Tamlin thinking of perdition  --  though of course three days of endless sermons had to be a factor  --  and how she 'd almost certainly wind up there one day , as she pounded out the wheezing refrain of " Shall We Gather at the River " for a sweltering congregation . Seated at an organ hauled into Brother Hickey 's big revival tent in the bed of a buckboard , Sarah endured , perspiring , longing to fan herself with her sheet music or brush away the damp tendrils of hair clinging to the sides of her neck . <p> Every year in August , sure as the hay harvest , Brother Hickey and his roustabouts descended on the community like a circus without animals or parades , erected a canvas sanctuary on the grassy banks of Stone Creek , and set about saving the heathen from certain damnation . <p> A portion of the congregation seemed to deem it necessary to get saved on an annual basis . There was n't much to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with no doubts about the fate of their immortal souls weighing on their minds , folks would be free to enjoy the picnic that always followed the preaching . <p> Sarah forced the last few notes of the old hymn through the organ pipes and sighed with relief . The air was heavy and still  --  a baby gave a brief , fretful squall  --  and then , remarkably , a breeze swept through the gathering , as soft and cool as the breath of heaven itself . <p> Startled , Sarah looked up from the cracked and yellowed keys of Brother Hickey 's well-traveled organ , over the turned heads of the salvation-seekers , and saw a man standing at the back of the tent . Tall and cleanshaven , with dark hair and eyes , he carried a dusty round-brimmed hat in one hand . His clothes were trail-worn , and the holster riding low on his right hip , gun-slinger fashion , was empty . A grin tilted a corner of his mouth slightly upward . <p> Brother Hickey , moving behind his portable pulpit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ , cleared his throat and opened his Bible . " Have you come to be saved , stranger ? " he boomed , employing his preacher voice . <p> The dark-haired man took a few steps forward . He moved with an easy grace , and for the space of a skipped heartbeat , Sarah wondered if he was some avenging angel , sent to put a stop to the show . " No , sir , " he said . " I do n't reckon I have . " His gaze strayed to Sarah , sitting there in the back of that buckboard , her best calico dress soaked under the armpits . The grin widened to a fleeting smile , as if he somehow knew the stays of her corset were stabbing the underside of her left breast , and all her other secrets , as well . A smile that imprinted itself on some sweet and wholly uncharted place inside her . " That was fine music , ma'am , " he told her directly . " I hope there 'll be more of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sat down next to Marshal Yarbro , who was grinning , and the two of them bumped shoulders . <p> Brother Hickey lifted his hands heavenward , closed his eyes in earnest and silent prayer , and then slammed a fist down onto the pulpit . Everybody jumped , Sarah noticed , except for the marshal and the stranger sitting beside him . <p> " Now is the day of Salvation ! " Brother Hickey thundered , his copious white whiskers quavering . " Sinners , come forward and be bathed in the Blood of the Lamb ! " <p> Several people rose and approached the makeshift altar , though most of the repenting had been done at previous services . There was dear old Mrs. Elsdon , who 'd probably never committed an actual sin , two or three ladies of ill repute from Jolene Bell 's saloon , brothel and bathhouse , though Miss Bell herself was noticeably absent , a handful of cowpunchers from Sam O'Ballivan 's ranch , mostly likely hoping to speed things along so the picnic could get underway . <p> If Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been amused . The revival was in its third and final day , and by now , even the most pious were ready to socialize over fried chicken and apple pie . The children were restless , longing to chase each other under the shady oak trees , wade in the creek , and make noise . <p> The praying and the saving went on for a long time , but at last Brother Hickey was through gathering in the lost sheep . He signaled Sarah , and she arranged her fingers on the keyboard , tried to put the dark-haired visitor out of her mind , and played a thunderous rendition of " What a Friend We Have in Jesus . " <p> As soon as she struck the final chord , the benches emptied and the stampede began . <p> Sarah sat still on the hard stool in front of the organ , almost faint with relief , her eyes closed . It was over for another year . As soon as everyone had left the tent , she would climb down from the bed of the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home . She kept a jar of tea cooling in the springhouse , and when she 'd drunk her fill , she 'd strip , stuff her corset into the stove , and take a sponge bath . <p> " Miss ? It is ' Miss , ' is n't it ? " <p> Sarah opened her eyes , saw the stranger standing right beside the buckboard , looking up at her . Again , she felt it , a peculiar jolting sensation that brought a blush to her cheeks , as though he 'd read her thoughts and even imagined her shut away in her bedroom , naked , sluicing her flesh with water from a basin . She resisted a humiliating urge to smooth her hair , sit up straighter . " Yes , " she said stiffly . <p> " Wyatt Yarbro , " the man said , putting out a hand . <p> Sarah hesitated , then took it , though tentatively . His fingers were strong , calloused , and cool as the breeze he 'd blown in on . " Sarah Tamlin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-seven years . <p> " Would you like some help getting down from there ? " <p> Short of lifting her skirts and leaping to the sawdust floor , as she would normally have done , Sarah had no graceful options . " All right , " she replied shyly . Then she climbed into the buckboard seat , careful not to let her ankles show , and Wyatt Yarbro put his hands on her waist and lifted her down . She stood looking up at him , stunned by the effect of his touch . Light-headed , she swayed slightly , and he steadied her . <p> His eyes were a deep brown , and they glinted with mischief and something else , too  --  some private , deep-seated sorrow . " I reckon it would be a sight cooler outside , under those oak trees alongside the creek , " he said . <p> Sarah merely nodded . Let herself be escorted out of the revival tent on Mr. Yarbro 's arm , in front of God and everybody . <p> Rowdy approached as Wyatt reclaimed his pistol from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow dog , Pardner , at his heels , and tipped his hat to Sarah . <p> " I did n't see Mrs. Yarbro in the congregation , " Sarah said . She liked Lark , a former schoolteacher who 'd stirred up quite a scandal when she took up with the marshal . <p> " The baby 's getting teeth , and it makes him fractious , " Rowdy replied . " They 'll be along later , when the heat lets up . " He turned slightly , gave Wyatt an affectionate slap on the shoulder . " I 'd introduce my brother properly , " he added , " but it seems you 've already made his acquaintance . " <p> " I 'm the good-looking one , " Wyatt said . <p> Just then , Fiona Harvey showed up , holding a plate piled high with fried chicken , potato salad and apple crumble . Fiona , who was thirty if she was a day , wanted a husband . Everybody knew that . <p> When and if Fiona managed to get married , Sarah would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fiona told Wyatt , batting her sparse eyelashes . <p> Sarah , who considered Fiona a friend , simmered behind a cordial smile . <p> Wyatt tipped his head and flashed a grin at Fiona . " Why , thank you , ma'am , " he said , accepting the plate . <p> Rowdy rolled his eyes , caught the expression on Sarah 's face , and winked at her . <p> " You 're welcome to come and sit with us , " Fiona simpered , indicating a cluster of women sitting on a blanket under a nearby tree . <p> The marshal took the plate from Wyatt 's hands and gave it back to Fiona . " My brother 's much obliged , " he said smoothly , " but we 've been expecting him , so Lark 's got a big spread on the table at home . " <p> " Thanks just the same , though , " Wyatt said . <p> Fiona took the rebuff gracefully , said she hoped Mr. Yarbro would come back for the fireworks and the dance that would take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . With a sidelong glance at Sarah , he allowed as how he enjoyed fireworks . <p> She blushed again , oddly flustered . <p> And Fiona pressed the plate into her hands . " Take this to your papa , " she told Sarah . " Heaven knows , he 'll appreciate a decent supper , the way you cook . " <p> " Why , thank you , Fiona , " Sarah said . <p> Wyatt and Rowdy exchanged glances , and one of them chuckled . <p> Fiona smiled and walked away . <p> " Give my regards to your father , " Rowdy said , as Sarah turned to go , once again at a loss for words . The next time she saw Fiona , she 'd have plenty to say , though . <p> " I 'd better see Miss Tamlin home , " Wyatt said , and before Rowdy could protest that Lark had dinner waiting , he 'd taken Sarah 's arm and escorted her halfway to the road . <p> Since it would be rude to tell him she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lip and marched along , resigned , carrying the plate like a crown on a velvet cushion . <p> An old spotted horse with a long cut on its side ambled along behind them , bridle jingling , reins wrapped loosely around the saddle horn . <p> Sarah looked back . <p> " That 's just Reb , " Wyatt said . <p> " What happened to his side ? " <p> " He had a run-in with a steer a while back . He 's healing up fine , though . " <p> Sarah wanted to ask a thousand other questions , but all of them jammed up in the back of her throat . She was sweating , her hair felt as though it would escape its pins at any moment , and she could almost feel the flames of Brother Hickey 's beloved hellfire licking at her hem . <p> Mr. Yarbro donned his dusty hat , which made him look like a highwayman out of some dime novel . Sarah was painfully conscious of his hand , cupping her elbow , and the way he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you really a bad cook ? " he asked , visibly restraining a grin . <p> " Yes , " Sarah admitted , with a heavy sigh . <p> He chuckled . " Guess that 's why you 're not taken , " he said . " No other explanation for it , with looks like yours . " <p> Sarah was scandalously pleased , and determined to hide the fact . She did n't think about her appearance much , given the busy life she led and her naturally practical turn of mind , but she knew she was passable . Her hair was dark , and she kept it shiny with rainwater shampoos , vinegar rinses and a hundred brush strokes every night . She had good skin , strong teeth , exceedingly blue eyes and a slender but womanly figure . <p> For all that , she was an old maid , too plainspoken and too smart to suit most men . Most likely , Mr. Yarbro was merely dallying with her . <p> " My looks are in no way remarkable , Mr. Yarbro , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She paused . Then , ever the banker 's daughter , started adding things up in her brain . " Are you an outlaw , like your brother was ? " she inquired bluntly . <p> " I used to be , " he said , surprising her . <p> She 'd expected another answer , she realized . A lie , falling easily from those expressive lips of his . Faced with the stark truth , she did n't know what to say . <p> Wyatt laughed and resettled his hat . <p> " What did you do ? " Sarah asked , once she 'd found her voice . They 'd entered Stone Creek proper by then , passing Rowdy 's office first , strolling along the sidewalk past the mercantile and her father 's bank . The sun was setting , and old Mr. Shaefer was lighting the gas streetlamps , one by one . <p> " Robbed a train or two , " Wyatt said . <p> " My goodness , " Sarah remarked . <p> " You 're safe with me , Miss Tamlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen the error of my ways and I 'm determined to take the high road , like my brother did . Are you planning to head back to the creek for the dancing and the fireworks ? " <p> Sarah shook her head , bemused . <p> " Then I reckon I wo n't bother to , either . " <p> So he had n't been taken with Fiona , then . Inwardly , Sarah gave a deep sigh . <p> All too soon , and not nearly soon enough , they 'd reached the gate in front of Sarah 's house . <p> He opened the gate for her , stood back politely while she passed through it . When she looked over her shoulder , he touched the brim of his hat . <p> " Good night , Sarah Tamlin , " he said . The glow of a nearby streetlamp cast his fine features into shadow . The paint horse waited politely on the sidewalk , nibbling at the leaves of Sarah 's favorite peony bush . <p> Sarah swallowed , rattled again . " Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and hurried along the walk , up the porch steps , into the house . When she pulled aside a lace curtain to peer out , the train robber was gone , and so was his horse . <p> Wyatt ate two plates full of supper , admired Lark , who was pretty , made the acquaintance of the other younger brother , Gideon , he 'd nearly forgotten he had , and dandled the baby on his knee for a while . The little kid was cute , if a mite fractious in temperament . His name was Hank , and he looked just like Rowdy . <p> The big kid , Gideon , gave Wyatt a suspicious onceover and took off for the festivities down by the creek . It was full dark by then , and fireworks spread like chrysanthemums against the sky . Wyatt , Rowdy and the baby sat on the porch steps in front of Rowdy 's small house , conveniently located in back of the jail , listening to the crickets , the sound of distant merriment , and the tinny tune of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things women did after they 'd served a meal . <p> " You 've done well for yourself , Rob , " Wyatt said quietly , using his brother 's given name . " A fine woman , a steady job , a son . I envy you a little . " <p> Rowdy leaned back on the porch step , resting on his elbows . Silvery light from the fireworks caught in his fair hair . " No reason you ca n't have the same , " he said . <p> " No reason except two years in a Texas prison , " Wyatt replied . He 'd told Sarah straight out that he 'd robbed trains , but he had n't mentioned the stretch behind bars . With a woman , a little honesty went a long way . <p> " Everybody 's done things they 're not proud of , Wyatt . " Rowdy shifted , looked reluctant . " About Sarah  --  " <p> " What about her ? " Wyatt asked , too quickly . <p> Rowdy considered a little longer before answering . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every cowpoke between here and Tucson has tried to court her , but she 's having none of it . I think she 's one of those  --  well  --  career women . " <p> " Career women ? " Wyatt echoed . During supper , he 'd learned that Lark had inherited a whole railroad from her first husband , and she ran it from Stone Creek , by mail and telegram , with a baby balanced on one hip . <br> Continues ...
