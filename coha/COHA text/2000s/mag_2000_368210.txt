A lot of people want to go to the Olympics , and only so many tickets are available . So to keep everybody happy , you sometimes have to stretch the definition of sport . This , no doubt , is how the Greeks came up with the pole vault . And this year offers a bounty of stupid sports to mollify the masses . Not only did I score you gymnastics tickets , you valuable client you , but they 're for this year 's newest Olympic sport , trampolining ! <P> And trampolining , if you think about it , is n't even so ridiculous a sport . At least it fulfills the basic requirement of promising very serious injury . Teenage girls jump 20 ft. in the air , do tricks called the double back tuck and the full-in-full-out , and then , if the long history of backyard trampolines is any indication , fall on their faces and cry . <P> Jennifer Parilla , the 19-year-old who will represent all of America 's hopes in Sydney , however , disappoints by saying her sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backyard trampoline . They 're so unsafe , " she protests . Parilla insists her sport is totally legitimate . " We go over to anywhere in Europe , and our competitions are televised , " she says . She obviously is not familiar with the quality of European programming . <P> The only trampolining televised in the U.S. is on The Man Show , which has a feature called " Girls on Trampolines " that is highly competitive in a very un-Olympic sort of way . Other than The Man Show 's hosts , it 's not easy to find hard-core tramp fans . Even Robert Null , Parilla 's coach , offers a parsed plug . " I think after this Olympics , more kids will want to do it , " he says . " I mean , it 's one more way to get to the Olympics . " <P> An eerily similar line is spun by Dan Cloppis , executive director of USA Badminton . " I mean , it 's a lot easier for my children to make it to the Olympics in badminton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps referring to as " the fastest sport in the world " but that also requires him to say the word shuttlecock . <P> But really , the ease of getting a gold medal does not a sport make . In fact , the ease the U.S. 's Dream Team will have winning the gold again has actually turned basketball into a nonsport . A sport , after all , has to include competition , and watching Vince Carter throwing it down against the Italians just is n't that gripping . <P> Synchronized swimming is gripping , because it 's really just soaking-wet attractive women flipping in sequined bathing suits . But as has too often been noted , it 's not a sport . In fact , the sport has become so defensive since it got its Saturday Night Live lashing in the 1980s that its website ,
