Hoot By Carl Hiaasen Random House Carl Hiaasen Roy would not have noticed the strange boy if it were n't for Dana Matherson , because Roy ordinarily did n't look out the window of the school bus . He preferred to read comics and mystery books on the morning ride to Trace Middle . But on this day , a Monday ( Roy would never forget ) , Dana Matherson grabbed Roy 's head from behind and pressed his thumbs into Roy 's temple , as if he were squeezing a soccer ball . The older kids were supposed to stay in the back of the bus , but Dana had snuck up behind Roy 's seat and ambushed him . When Roy tried to wriggle free , Dana mushed his face against the window . It was then , squinting through the smudged glass , that Roy spotted the strange boy running along the sidewalk . It appeared as if he was hurrying to catch the school bus , which had stopped at a corner to pick up more kids . The boy was straw-blond and wiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expression on his face was intent and serious . He wore a faded Miami Heat basketball jersey and dirty khaki shorts , and here was the odd part : no shoes . The soles of his bare feet looked as black as barbecue coals . Trace Middle School did n't have the world 's strictest dress code , but Roy was pretty sure that some sort of footwear was required . The boy might have been carrying sneakers in his backpack , if only he 'd been wearing a backpack . No shoes , no backpack , no books-strange , indeed , on a school day . Roy was sure that the barefoot boy would catch all kinds of grief from Dana and the other big kids once he boarded the bus , but that did n't happen .... Because the boy kept running-past the corner , past the line of students waiting to get on the bus ; past the bus itself . Roy wanted to shout , " Hey , look at that guy ! " but his mouth was n't working so well . Dana Matherson still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . As the bus pulled away from the intersection , Roy hoped to catch another glimpse of the boy farther up the street . However , he had turned off the sidewalk and was now cutting across a private yard-running very fast , much faster than Roy could run and maybe even faster than Richard , Roy 's best friend back in Montana . Richard was so fast that he got to work out with the high school track squad when he was only in seventh grade . Dana Matherson was digging his fingernails into Roy 's scalp , trying to make him squeal , but Roy barely felt a thing . He was gripped with curiosity as the running boy dashed through one neat green yard after another , getting smaller in Roy 's vision as he put a wider distance between himself and the school bus . Roy saw a big pointy-eared dog , probably a German shepherd , bound off somebody 's porch and go for the boy . Incredibly , the boy did n't change his course . He vaulted over the dog , crashed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy gasped . " Whassamatter , cowgirl ? Had enough ? " This was Dana , hissing in Roy 's right ear . Being the new kid on the bus , Roy did n't expect any help from the others . The " cowgirl " remark was so lame , it was n't worth getting mad about . Dana was a well-known idiot , on top of which he outweighed Roy by at least fifty pounds . Fighting back would have been a complete waste of energy . " Had enough yet ? We ca n't hear you , Tex . " Dana 's breath smelled like stale cigarettes . Smoking and beating up smaller kids were his two main hobbies . " Yeah , okay , " Roy said impatiently . " I 've had enough .

That same morning , a police officer named David Delinko was sent to the future site of another Mother Paula 's All-American Pancake House . It was a vacant lot at the corner of East Oriole and Woodbury , on the eastern edge of town . Officer Delinko was met by a man in a dark blue pickup truck . The man , who was as bald as a beach ball , introduced himself as Curly . Officer Delinko thought the bald man must have a good sense of humor to go by such a nickname , but he was wrong . Curly was cranky and unsmiling . " You should see what they done , " he said to the policeman . " Who ? " " Follow me , " the man called Curly said . Officer Delinko got in step behind him . " The dispatcher said you wanted to report some vandalism . " " That 's right , " Curly grunted over his shoulder .

" asked Officer Delinko . " Yep . They yanked ' em out of the ground , every damn one . " Probably just kids . " " And then they threw'em every which way , " Curly said , waving a beefy arm , " and then they filled in the holes . " " That 's a little weird , " the policeman remarked . " When did this happen ? " " Last night or early this morning , " Curly said . " Maybe it do n't look like a big deal , but it 's gon na take a while to get the site marked out again .

" " Well , no- " " Were any of them destroyed ? " asked Officer Delinko . " How much does one of these things cost-a buck or two ? " The man called Curly was losing his patience . " They did n't break none of the stakes , " he said gruffly . " Not even one ? " The policeman frowned . He was trying to figure out what to put in his report .
