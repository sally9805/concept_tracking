Chapter One Sunday , March 12 , 12:30 A.M. Normally a suicide drew a bigger crowd , even in a high-priced neighborhood like this one , Detective Aidan Reagan thought grimly as he slammed his car door and flinched at the bite of the cold air blowing in from the lake . But most people with any sense were inside on a night like this . Aidan could n't afford the luxury . Dispatch called and he and his partner were next in the barrel . For a damn suicide . This was a distraction from the child homicide he 'd spent the last two days working . He hated child homicides but he thought he might hate suicides just a little bit more . He could only hope he could get this jumper off his desk quickly so he could focus on finding who 'd broken a six-year-old 's neck like a dry twig . The people who watched from the curb appeared to be twenty-somethings coming home from a night on the town . They waited silently , eyes fastened to the scene with a morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror Aidan understood . No body was a pretty sight , but a plunge twenty-two stories was a step beyond generic gruesomeness . As for the sympathy ... Aidan would save his for the real victims . Whoever said suicide was a victimless crime had obviously never notified a family . He had . He wished the morbidcuriosity-seekers could see that part of it . They might not find such a scene so damn fascinating after all . But they were well-behaved at least , standing silently behind the yellow tape strung between two light posts by the officers first on the scene . An occasional stamp of cold feet broke the unnatural silence . One of the two uniforms stood by the yellow tape at the curb , the other on the sidewalk , facing away from the body . Aidan approached , his shield in his hand . After four months it still felt strange , approaching the uniform , not wearing one . " Reagan , Homicide , " he said crisply , then stopped short , first at the stench , then at the sight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the force took a nasty lurch . " My God . " The uniform nodded , his jaw tight . " That 's what we said . " Aidan 's eyes took a quick trip up the wall of identical balconies and back down to focus on the iron spike protruding from what had been a woman 's chest . Now her chest was ripped open , revealing shattered bone and ... insides . For just a moment he stared , remembering the other time he 'd seen such a sight . He steeled his spine . This was nothing like the other . That other victim had been an innocent . This woman lying here ... she was dead by her own hand . No sympathy , he told himself . This woman had thrown herself twenty-two stories to concrete-and onto a decorative wrought-iron fence . The fence was only about a foot high , mostly inverted " us " , but every four feet or so a spike jutted upward . The force of her impact on the spike had literally split her wide open , geysering blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She hit it dead on , " he murmured . The uniform winced . " So to speak . " Aidan dragged his gaze back to the cop 's drawn face . " You are ? " " I 'm Forbes and that 's my partner , DiBello , over there doing crowd control . " Forbes grimaced . " I lost the toss . " Aidan scanned the faces of the silent crowd that needed no control , but hell , a toss was a toss . He 'd lost his fair share during his years in uniform . " Anybody see anything ? " " Two seventeen-year-olds say she jumped from the twenty-second floor at about midnight . " Forbes pointed a black gloved finger upward . " It 's that balcony up there , the one with the curtains blowing in the wind , third from the left . " " Nobody pushed her ? " " Kids did n't see anybody . They said she kind of glided up to the railing . " Aidan frowned . " Glided up ? Like a ghost ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kept repeating it , again and again . I put ' em in the back of the squad car until you could talk to them . They 're pretty shook up . " " Poor kids . " They deserved the sympathy . This sight would haunt them for a long time . They were only seventeen , just a year older than his own sister . He shuddered at the thought of Rachel seeing such a grisly sight , then jerked a nod toward the crowd . " Any of them know her ? " " DiBello asked , but nobody did . " Aidan looked at the woman 's face , her features now loose and spongy . Blood seeped from her ears , nose , and her open mouth . The iron fence had taken the brunt of the force of her fall , but any fall from that height smashed the skull , the scalp basically containing the mess . The features kind of liquefied , giving the face a macabre , melted wax look . " Nobody would recognize her now , even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment she jumped from . Is the super around ? " " I knocked but he 's not home . A neighbor says he 's at a Bulls game . " " The game was over two hours ago . Where is he now ? " " I paged him once . I 'll see if I can find out where he hangs . " " Thanks , man . Also , can we move this crowd to the other side of the street ? And make sure nobody in the crowd takes any pictures . Have your partner keep his eyes open for camera cell phones . " Aidan pulled out his own cell and called in for a warrant and a medical examiner , then crouched down to take a closer look at the body . She was wrapped in black lace and silk and he wondered if she 'd dressed especially for the occasion . If she had , the effect was ruined by the spike . And the guts oozing onto the concrete . He swallowed hard . It was a hell of a mess for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides , he thought bitterly . They wanted to go out with dramatic flair but they never thought about the consequences to anybody else . To the people they left behind . To the people who had to clean up . Selfish . So damn avoidable . Goddammit . He realized he 'd clenched his fists and deliberately loosened them . Get a grip , Reagan . The deep breath he drew filled his senses with the metallic scent of warm blood and foul stench of busted bowel , but underneath he caught a hint of cinnamon as footsteps crunched the snow behind him . His partner was here . " Hell of a way to go , " Murphy stated in his quiet way . Aidan shot a harsh glance over his shoulder . " Hell of a thing to do to her family . Ca n't wait to make that visit . " " One thing at a time , Aidan , " Murphy said evenly , but his eyes were kind and understanding and made Aidan feel small . " So what do we know ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses say she ' glided ' up , whatever the hell that means . I have n't talked to them yet . As for her , she was young . Her arms look well-toned . " He focused in on her limbs , the only body parts that remained reasonably unscathed . " Maybe in her late twenties or early thirties . " He pointed at one hand that draped over the inverted " us " of the decorative fence . " Big rock on her right hand , no sign of any rings on her left , so she 's probably unmarried . Somebody has some money . That ring costs a hell of a lot of green . Her arms and hands do n't appear to have any defensive wounds . " Murphy crouched down next to him . " Snazzy colors . " Her two-inch long nails were painted bright bloodred . " I noticed . The red against the black lace does make a real statement . " Murphy shrugged . " It would n't be the first time a jumper wanted to leave a lasting impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " No . I 'm hoping the apartment she jumped from was hers . I called in for a warrant and the ME 's on his way . Let 's go talk to the kids who- " " Let me pass . " The voice cut through the night-soft , yet ringing with authority . " Ma'am , you ca n't go through here . Please stay behind the tape . " Aidan looked up in time to see Officer DiBello 's arm come up to block a woman in a tan wool coat , her dark hair whipping in the wind , covering her face . Again she spoke , her voice calm and quiet but commanding . " I 'm her doctor . Let me pass , Officer . " " Let her through , " Murphy echoed and DiBello did , but Aidan stepped into the woman 's path , blocking her once again before she could contaminate his scene . She lifted on her toes , but still was n't quite tall enough to see over his shoulder . Aidan put his hand on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but cooperated . " Ma'am , we 're waiting for the ME . There 's nothing you can do now . " She took a step back , going very still . " She jumped ? " Aidan nodded . " I 'm sorry , ma'am . Maybe you can tell us ... " But the words just trailed away as she pushed her hair from her face and instant recognition sent a new wave of anger to boil his blood . " You 're Ciccotelli . " Dr. Tess Ciccotelli . This woman was no doctor . She was a shrink . That alone would have been bad enough , but Miz Chick had made quite a name for herself . She was n't just a garden variety do-you-hate-your-mother shrink . She was a bleeding heart shrink who 'd thrown weeks of solid police work in the chipper-shredder when she 'd sat on the stand and calmly testified that a known , confessed killer of three children and one cop was unfit to stand trial . Four grieving families were denied justice because a " doctor " said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd confessed to brutally murdering three little girls . Babies . With his bare hands he 'd strangled a seasoned cop that was trying to take him down . That he was crazy did n't make him an iota less guilty . Now the bastard was sitting pretty in a Chicago psychiatric hospital making pot holders all day instead of in a six-by-eight waiting for a needle in his arm . It was n't fair . It was n't right . But it had happened . And this woman had allowed it to happen . Aidan had been there , sitting in the courtroom with the other cops , hoping against hope that Ciccotelli would change her mind , hoping she 'd do the right thing . He remembered how the girls ' parents had wept quietly in the courtroom , knowing they 'd find no justice that day . How the cop 's wife had sat front and center , surrounded by a sea of supportive uniforms . Ciccotelli had n't blinked , just continued looking straight ahead with cool brown eyes . Just like she was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked . " Detective Aidan Reagan . This is my partner Detective Todd Murphy . " Her eyes narrowed slightly as she studied his face and it was all he could do to maintain his glare . From his seat in the courtroom she 'd been sleek , sophisticated . Unapproachable . Up close there was a wild beauty to her features , yet she was still unapproachable . His own eyes narrowed as she turned to Murphy . " Todd , please ask your partner to step aside . I can at least give you a positive ID . " Murphy grasped her arm gently . " Tess , you do n't want to do that . She 's ... She 's really messed up . " Aidan stepped aside , holding out his arm in mock gallantry . " If she wants to see , by all means let the good doctor look . " Murphy shot him a warning glare . " Aidan . " " It 's all right , Todd , " she murmured and stepped forward without a flinch . She stood looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , her face perfectly composed , her eyes still cool . " Her name was Cynthia Adams . She has no next of kin . " From her coat pocket she pulled a business card and handed it to Murphy without a tremor . " Call me if you have questions , " she said . " I 'll answer what I can . " And with that she turned away and started walking toward a gray Mercedes parked behind Murphy 's plain Ford . Aidan 's annoyance bubbled over . " And that 's it ? " " Aidan , " Murphy cautioned . " Not now . " " If not now , when ? " He controlled his voice , conscious of the crowd camped nearby . " She waltzes in here and IDs the victim , cool as a damn cucumber . And then she just walks away ? How about what made her jump twenty-two stories , Doctor ? You should know , should n't you ? " And you should care , dammit , he thought viciously . You should care about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he finished on a hiss and watched her pause , her hands deep in her pockets . She pulled a glove from her pocket and tugged it over her fingers , her back to them . " Call me if you need me , Todd , " was all she said before walking away . Murphy 's eyes flashed as he sucked in both cheeks . " Aidan , I told you not now . " Aidan turned on his heel , dismissing her . " What does it matter ? It 's not like she gives a damn anyway . " " You have no idea what you 're talking about . You do n't know her . " Aidan looked over his shoulder . Murphy was watching Ciccotelli cross the street , his face one big , wholly uncharacteristic scowl . " And you do ? " He would n't have expected it . The venerable Todd Murphy , fallen prey to the charms of a cold piece of work like Miz Chick . Well , I wo n't . Murphy blew out an angry breath that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant of time . Then the barrier was gone as was the scowl , leaving Murphy staring at Ciccotelli with a sadness that gave Aidan serious pause . " Yeah . As a matter of fact I do . Go talk to the teenagers , Aidan . I 'll be back in a minute . " Aidan shrugged away his uncertainty . Let Murphy deal with the icicle . He had other things to do , like process a crime scene so the ME could scoop up what was left of Cynthia Adams and they could all go home . He 'd take the teenagers ' statement , check her apartment for ID , and then he 'd get the hell out of here . Another minute . Just another minute . Tess Ciccotelli chanted the words in her mind , a mantra to keep her composure until she was alone . Cynthia was dead . Dear God . Lying on the street , ripped apart ... Do n't think about her . Do n't think about her dead and mutilated . Just run . Run fast . Just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not yet . She fumbled the key in the car door lock , conscious of Todd Murphy and his partner behind her , watching . Todd and his very angry partner , whoever he was . He said his name was Aidan Reagan , she remembered , finally getting the key to slide into the lock , pulling the door open . She made her mind focus on the picture of the man 's cold blue eyes . He 'd been so angry . No , he 'd been furious . Just another- " Tess ? " Dammit . She bobbled her keys , dropping them to the dark street where they skittered underneath her car . She drew a deep breath . So close . " I 'm all right , Todd . Go and do your job . " " I am . Tess , you 're shaking . " " Todd , please . " Her voice hitched , humiliatingly . " I need to get out of here . " He took her arm and guided her into the driver 's seat . " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you home . " " There is n't anyone , " she said numbly . " That 's what took me so long to get here . I called my partners , my friends . I never come to a patient 's house alone . Not done . Not ethical . " She was rambling now and could n't seem to stop herself . " Nobody was home , so I came anyway . " She closed her eyes . Opened them again when all she saw was Cynthia ... lying there . " And I was too late . " " This is n't your fault , Tess , " Murphy said gently . " You know this . " A sob was building . Resolutely Tess shoved it back . " She 's dead , Todd . " How stupid was that ? Cynthia Adams lay gutted on the street , her head a ball of Jell-O , her guts hanging out for all to see . Yeah , she was dead all right . " I know . " He took her hand , gave it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tess ? Did she call you ? " Tess shook her head . " No . I got an anonymous call from one of her neighbors . " " Why did she jump ? " His voice was calm , so gentle , battering the dam that kept her tears at bay . " Dammit , Todd , let me go . Please . I 'll talk to you tomorrow , I promise . " " I wo n't let you go until I 'm sure you 're all right . " Tess drew another deep breath and let it out slowly . Gripping her steering wheel with both hands , she lifted her gaze over Murphy 's shoulder to where his partner stood next to a squad car , his hard face illuminated by its bright flashing lights . He was looking at them . Watching her . Even from this distance , she could feel the man 's piercing stare . His animosity . Those intense blue eyes were narrowed , his jaw tight . " You have a new partner , " she murmured , holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aidan Reagan . " Aidan Reagan . " He 's related to Abe ? " She knew Abe Reagan , trusted him . Trusted his wife Kristen . They were good people . " Aidan and Abe are brothers . " " That makes sense then . " Aidan Reagan mirrored his brother 's dark good looks . They had the same dark hair , the same blue eyes , although Aidan 's were harder , starker than his brother 's . His face was sharper , his jaw a little squarer . His mouth ... softer before he 'd realized who she was . He had the capacity for compassion . Just not toward me . " Tess , he- " Murphy 's voice stumbled to a halt . " Does n't like me , " she said levelly . " It 's all right , Todd . Not many of them do . " His sigh was deep and sad . " He was there , Tess , in the courtroom that day .
