Doctors have long been aware that daily treatment with inhaled steroids is critical to saving the lives of patients with severe asthma  --  both children and adults . Although the drugs can not stop an asthma attack that has already started ( different medications are needed for that ) , inhaled steroids are very good at counteracting the chronic inflammation that predisposes the lungs to asthma attacks in the first place . Until now , however , many physicians have hesitated to use inhaled steroids to treat milder cases of asthma in children . The drugs have side effects  --  most notably an apparent slowing of bone growth  --  that make them seem less than ideal for youngsters , whose bones are still developing . <P> But two reports published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine conclude that the benefits of inhaled steroids outweigh the risks in children after all . In the first study , which tracked more than 1,000 North American kids ages 5 to 12 suffering from mild to moderate asthma , researchers found that boys and girls on inhaled steroids were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to need treatment with even more powerful drugs . While these kids were indeed about 0.4 in. shorter than children on nonsteroid drugs after the first year of treatment , the lag in growth rates quickly disappeared . Results from the children 's X rays indicate there should be no measurable difference in adult height . Similarly , in the second study , of 211 adults from Denmark who started treatment with inhaled steroids as children , researchers found no long-term effect on height . <P> These results should reassure parents who have been told their son or daughter needs inhaled steroids . " The word steroid is scary and confusing to people , " says Dr. Gail Shapiro , a clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle and a co-author of one of the papers . The first problem is that corticosteroids ( the scientific name of the asthma drugs ) sounds an awful lot like the anabolic steroids used by some body builders . They are n't . Not only are corticosteroids safer but the inhaler makes them especially effective as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle in the lungs , where it does the most good and causes fewer side effects . <P> There was one surprise from the North American study . Contrary to expectations , children on inhaled steroids did not fare better than the control group in tests that measure lung capacity . Researchers speculate that there was already some permanent damage that the steroids could not counteract , as study subjects had been found to have asthma an average of five years before they started treatment . Some experts believe that for optimal results , steroid therapy should begin within two or three years of the initial symptoms . If that 's the case , doctors may need to give inhaled steroids to children as young as one and two years old . <P> Before that can happen , new studies  --  some already under way  --  must determine if the benefits of inhaled steroids outweigh the risks for toddlers . Until then , doctors and parents of the youngest patients are going to face some tough decisions . <P> For more information on asthma , visit     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
