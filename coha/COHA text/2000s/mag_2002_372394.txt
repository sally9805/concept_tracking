Laws that mandate a LIVING WAGE have helped reduce poverty , according to a study by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California . The laws , instituted in nearly 40 cities , mandate a HIGHER MINIMUM wage than the Federal Government 's $5.15 per hour . Critics have long argued that the living wage can REDUCE JOBS , since employers may be unwilling or unable to pay higher wages . And living-wage laws do n't cover all workers , often only those whose employers have city contracts . Still , in cities like SAN FRANCISCO ( where the living wage is $10 an hour ) , the report says the laws , on balance , have made people 's lives better .
