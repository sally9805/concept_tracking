Introduction // One of the triumphs of modern life is our ability to distance ourselves from the // simple facts of our own existence . We love our hamburgers , but we 've never // seen the inside of a slaughterhouse . We 're not sure if the asparagus that // accompanies our salmon is grown in Ecuador or Oregon . We flush the toilet // and do n't want to know any more . If we feel bad , we take a pill . We do n't // even bury our own dead  --  they are carted away and buried or burned for us. // It 's easy to forget what a luxury this is  --  until you visit a place like // China . Despite its booming economy in recent years , the insulating walls of // modern life have not yet been fully erected there . In restaurants , the entr ? es // are often alive in a cage in the dining room . Herbs and acupuncture needles // inspire more faith than pharmaceutical drugs . Toilets stink . In rural areas , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you flip the switch on the // wall and the light goes on , you know exactly what it costs  --  all you have to // do is take a deep breath and feel the burn of coal smoke in your lungs . // To a westerner , nothing is more uncivilized than the sulfury smell // of coal . You ca n't take a whiff without thinking of labor battles and // underground mine explosions , of chugging smokestacks and black lung . // But coal is everywhere in twenty-first-century China . It 's piled up // on sidewalks , pressed into bricks and stacked near the back doors of // homes , stockpiled into small mountains in the middle of open fields , and // carted around behind bicycles and old wheezing locomotives . Plumes of coal // smoke rise from rusty stacks on every urban horizon . There is soot on every // windowsill and around the collar of every white shirt . Coal is what 's fueling // China 's economic boom , and nobody makes any pretense that it is n't . And // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of coal will lift China // into a better world . It will make the country richer , more civilized , and more // remote from the hard facts of life , just like us. // The cost of the rough journey China is undertaking is obvious . // More than six thousand workers a year are killed in China 's coal mines . The // World Health Organization estimates that in East Asia , a region made up // predominantly of China and South Korea , 355,000 people a year die from the // effects of urban outdoor air pollution . The first time I visited Jiamusi , a city in // China 's industrial north , it was so befouled by coal smoke that I could hardly // see across the street . All over China , limestone buildings are dissolving in // the acidic air . In Beijing , the ancient outdoor statuary at a 700-year-old Taoist // temple I visited was encased in Plexiglas to protect it . And it 's not just the // Chinese who are paying for their coal-fired prosperity . Pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is inhaled by sunbathers on // Malibu beach . Toxic mercury from Chinese coal finds its way into polar bears // in the Arctic . Most seriously , the carbon dioxide released by China 's mad // burning of coal is helping to destabilize the climate of the entire planet . // All this would be much easier to condemn if the West had not // done exactly the same thing during its headlong rush to become rich and // prosperous . In fact , we 're still doing it . Although America is a vastly richer // country with many more options available to us , our per capita consumption // of coal is three times higher than China 's . You can argue that we manage it // better  --  our mines are safer , our power plants are cleaner  --  but mostly we // just hide it better . We hide it so well , in fact , that many Americans think that // coal went out with corsets and top hats . Most of us have no idea how central // coal is to our everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really costs us. // In truth , the United States is more dependent on coal today than // ever before . The average American consumes about twenty pounds of it a // day . We do n't use it to warm our hearths anymore , but we burn it by wire // whenever we flip on the light switch or charge up our laptops . More than one // hundred years after Thomas Edison connected the first light bulb to a coal- // fired generator , coal remains the bedrock of the electric power industry in // America . About half the electricity we consume comes from coal  --  we burn // more than a billion tons of it a year , usually in big , aging power plants that // churn out amazing quantities of power , profit , and pollution . In fact , electric // power generation is one of the largest and most capital-intensive industries in // the country , with revenues of more than $260 billion in 2004 . And the rise of // the Internet  --  a global network of electrons  --  has only increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to admit it , but our shiny // white iPod economy is propped up by dirty black rocks . // This was not how things were supposed to go in America . Coal // was supposed to be the engine of the industrial revolution , not the Internet // revolution . It once powered our steamships and trains ; it forged the steel that // won the wars and shaped our cars and skyscrapers and airplanes . It kept // pioneers warm on the prairie and built fortunes for robber barons such as // Henry Frick and Andrew Carnegie . Without coal , the world as we know it // today would be impossible to imagine . There should be monuments to coal in // every big city , giant statues of Pennsylvania anthracite and West Virginia // bituminous . It is literally the rock that built America . // But we 've been hooked on coal for almost 150 years now , and like // a Bowery junkie , we keep telling ourselves it 's time to come clean , without // ever actually doing it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in // locomotives in the 1940s , and by the 1950s it seemed that coal was on its // way out for electricity generation , too . Nuclear power was the great dream of // the post-World War II era , but the near-meltdown of the Three Mile Island // nuclear plant in 1979 put an end to that . Then natural gas overtook coal as // the fuel of choice . If coal was our industrial smack , natural gas was our // methadone : it was clean , easy to transport , and nearly as cheap as coal . // Virtually every power plant built in America between 1975 and 2002 was gas- // fired . Almost everybody in the energy world presumed that the natural gas // era would soon give way to even cleaner sources of power generation  --  wind , // solar , biofuels , hydrogen , perhaps someday solar panels on the moon . As for // the old coal plants , they would be dismantled , repowered , or left to rust in the // fields . // But like many revolutions , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy-wise , the fundamental problem in the world today is that the earth 's // reserves of fossil fuels are finite but our appetite for them is not . The issue is // not simply that there are more people in the world , consuming more fossil // fuels , but that as economies grow and people in developing nations are lifted // out of poverty , they buy cars and refrigerators and develop an appetite for // gas , oil , and coal . Between 1950 and 2000 , as the world population grew by // roughly 140 percent , fossil fuel consumption increased by almost 400 // percent . By 2030 , the world 's demand for energy is projected to more than // double , with most of that energy coming from fossil fuels . // Of course , every barrel of oil we pump out of the ground , every // cubic foot of natural gas we consume , and every ton of coal we burn further // depletes reserves . For a while , our day of reckoning was put off by the fact // that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // burned , the better we became at finding more , lulling us into a false belief // that the world 's reserves of fossil fuels are eternal . But that delusion ca n't // last forever . In fact , there are increasing signs that it wo n't last much longer . // Oil is the most critical fossil fuel for modern economies , // underlying everything from transportation to manufacturing . In 2004 , the world // consumed about 80 million barrels of oil each day , about 30 percent of which // came from the Middle East . The world is not going to run out of oil anytime // soon , but it might run out of cheap , easy-to-get oil . As that happens , prices // are likely to spike , fundamentally disrupting major parts of the world 's // economy . You do n't have to buy into the apocalyptic scenarios that some // doomsayers predict  --  the collapse of industrial society , widespread // famine  --  to see that the end of cheap oil is going to inspire panic and // economic chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The situation with natural gas is not much better . In the United // States , consumption of natural gas , which is mostly used for home heating // and the manufacture of industrial products , as well as agricultural fertilizers // and chemicals , has jumped by about 40 percent in the past two decades . // About 85 percent of that gas came from domestic sources , but production in // the United States has been flat for several decades , leading us to import // more and more from Canada , where production is also beginning to peak . // There are still substantial reserves in places such as Russia and Qatar , but // the global shipping and trading infrastructure is woefully undeveloped . // Upgrading it will cost billions of dollars and take decades to complete . Not // surprisingly , natural gas prices have tripled in the past few years and caused // home heating bills to rise rapidly in many regions of the country . // What about the other alternatives ? Nuclear power can be used to // generate electricity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty // years . This is primarily because nuclear plants are still haunted by the // ghosts of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl , as well as unresolved problems of // radioactive waste . Even if the social and environmental hurdles could be // overcome , nuclear plants are so expensive to build that a major resurgence is // unlikely . And as much as we would all like to imagine we could live in a world // powered by solar panels and wind turbines , these alternative energy sources // are not yet capable of powering our high-tech economy . // Out of this , coal has emerged as the default fuel of choice . Coal // has a number of virtues as a fuel : it can be shipped via boats and railroads , // it 's easy to store , and it 's easy to burn . But coal 's main advantage over other // fuels is that it 's cheap and plentiful . There are an estimated 1 trillion tons of // recoverable coal in the world , by far the largest reserve of fossil fuel left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal prices in 2004 and 2005 , coal is still // inexpensive compared to other fuels . In a world starved for energy , the // importance of this simple fact can not be underestimated : the world needs // cheap power , and coal can provide it . // America is literally built upon thick seams of coal . Just as Saudi // Arabia dominates the global oil market because of the geological good luck // of having more than 20 percent of the world 's oil reserves , the United States // is a big advocate for coal because it has the geological good luck of having // more than 25 percent of the world 's recoverable coal reserves  --  about 270 // billion tons  --  buried within its borders . As coal industry executives never tire // of pointing out , this is enough coal to fuel America at the current rate of // consumption for about 250 years . To put the size of its bounty into // perspective , consider this : all of western Europe has only 36 billion tons of // recoverable coal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States  --  // 126 billion tons . India and Australia , both big coal burners , have even less // than China . The only country with reserves that come close to America 's is // Russia , with 176 billion tons , but much of that coal is in remote regions and // difficult to mine . Not surprisingly , coal boosters often refer to America as " the // Saudi Arabia of coal . " // America 's great bounty of coal confers upon the United States // many economic and political advantages . As a purely practical matter , it // means that America will not go dark while scientists search for a // replacement for fossil fuels . If the world becomes energy-starved , our // reserves mean that America will have a source of fuel to keep our factories // running and our cities well lit . If oil supplies collapse and prices skyrocket , // we can begin a crash program to build coal liquefaction plants , which can // turn coal into synthetic diesel . It wo n't keep our SUVs rolling , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar process , coal can also be // transformed into synthetic natural gas , fertilizers , and a variety of industrial // chemicals . // But this great bounty of coal is also a great liability . It means that // America has a big incentive to drag out the inevitable transition to cleaner , // more modern forms of energy generation . In a world that is moving toward // energy efficiency , coal is a big loser . Alternative energy guru Amory Lovins // estimates that by the time you mine the coal , haul it to the power plant , burn // it , and then send the electricity out over the wires to the incandescent bulb in // your home , only about 3 percent of the energy contained in a ton of coal is // transformed into light . In fact , just the energy wasted by coal plants in // America would be enough to power the entire Japanese economy . In effect , // America 's vast reserve of coal is like a giant carbon anchor slowing down the // nation 's transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirtiest // and most carbon-intensive of all fossil fuels  --  coal plants are responsible for // nearly 40 percent of U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse // gas  --  a commitment to coal is tantamount to a denial of a whole host of // environmental and public health issues , including global warming . When // you 're sitting on top of 250 years ' worth of coal , an international agreement to // limit carbon dioxide emissions , such as the Kyoto Protocol , is easily seen // as a crude attempt by jealous competitors to blunt one of America 's great // strategic and economic advantages . // In America , the story of coal 's emergence as the default fuel of // choice is inextricably tied up with corruption , politics , and war . California 's // long , torturous " energy crisis , " which lasted through the summer of 2000 and // culminated in rolling blackouts in January 2001 , underscored the need for // new investment in electricity generation and transmission . The collapse of // Big Coal 's arch-nemesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luster. // Once heralded as a great modernizing force in the electric power industry , // promising to bring a market-driven revolution to the old energy empire , Enron // turned out to be a den of thieves . The company 's fall  --  one of the largest // bankruptcies in U.S. history  --  helped throw the natural gas market into // turmoil , sending prices skyrocketing and making coal so inexpensive in // comparison that operating a coal plant became , as one industry consultant // explained it to me , " like running a legal mint . " // The 2000 presidential election was another turning point . // Democratic candidate Al Gore was one of the first American politicians to // take global warming seriously , and anyone who takes global warming // seriously is not a friend of Big Coal . Coal industry executives knew that if // Gore was elected , regulations to limit or tax carbon dioxide emissions // would n't be far behind . So Big Coal threw its money and muscle behind // George W. Bush , helping him gain a decisive edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratic stronghold that had not voted for a // Republican presidential candidate in seventy-five years . After the disputed // Florida recount , West Virginia 's five electoral votes provided the margin that // Bush needed to take his seat in the Oval Office . // President Bush made good on his debt . Within weeks of taking // the oath of office , Bush began staffing regulatory agencies with former coal // industry executives and lobbyists . Not surprisingly , Big Coal also played a // prominent role in Vice President Dick Cheney 's National Energy Policy // Development Group , which was charged with crafting a new energy policy . // The task force 's recommendations were unabashedly coal-friendly , including // a call for up to 1,900 new power plants over the next twenty years ; a $2 // billion , ten-year subsidy for " clean coal " technology ; and a recommendation // that the Department of Justice " review " enforcement actions against dirty coal // burners . // Finally , the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on // September 11 , 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it // took the spotlight off many of the Bush administration 's controversial coal- // friendly energy policies , which were just beginning to make headlines . More // important , 9/11 changed the tone of the debate about energy in America , // making many of us reconsider the high cost of our dependence on oil from // the Middle East . In our globally connected world , " energy independence " is // more of a political slogan than a practical reality . But as long as American // soldiers were dying in the oil-rich Middle East , it seemed downright // unpatriotic to oppose coal . // For Big Coal , this change in America 's political and economic // climate was transformative . Around the country , any open patch of ground // near a railroad , a high-voltage transmission line , and a decent-size population // of electricity consumers became a possible site for a new coal plant . As of // 2005 , more than 120 new plants , representing more than $99 billion in new // investment , were either planned or under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopening , and old coal miners were dusting off // their boots . Wall Street analysts , in a swoon over the old rock ( the Street // loves big , expensive projects with all-but-guaranteed returns such as coal // plants ) , began cranking out pro-coal reports with titles such as " Come On // Over to the Dark Side " and " Party On , King Coal ! " The rebirth of coal is not // just about energy ; it is also a cultural uprising of sorts , a taking back of a key // part of America 's economic life that is , in its own way , as reactionary as the // public campaigns against evolution or gay marriage . It is about the revenge of // the Old Economy over all those technology-loving geeks who thought an // energy revolution was at hand , who said that the forces of creative // destruction would wreak havoc on one of the world 's great industrial empires , // and who naively believed that the future would be powered by solar panels // and biodiesel. // Lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting of what this // new coal boom might really cost us . In January 2006 , seventeen men died in // Appalachian coal mines , including twelve men in an explosion at the Sago // mine in northern West Virginia and two more after a fire in the Alma mine in // the southern part of the state . Since 1900 , more than 100,000 people have // been killed in coal mine accidents , many forever entombed by collapsed // roofs and tumbling pillars . Black lung , a disease common among miners from // inhaling coal dust , can be conservatively estimated to have killed another // 200,000 workers . And burning coal is even more deadly . In just the past // twenty years , air pollution from coal plants has shortened the lives of more // than half a million Americans . The broad legacy of environmental // devastation  --  acid rain , polluted lakes and rivers , mined-out mountains  --  is // impossible to tabulate . In Appalachia alone , the waste from mountaintop // removal mining ( instead of removing the coal from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) has destroyed more than 700 miles of streams , // polluted the region 's groundwater and rivers , and turned about 400,000 acres // of some of the world 's most biologically rich temperate forests into flat , // barren wastelands . Plumes of toxic particles drift from Ohio northeast to // Maine ; a molecule of mercury emitted from the stack of a power plant in // Tampa ends up in the brain of a child in Minneapolis . If and when fruit trees // start growing on the Alaskan tundra , American coal burners past and present // will be largely responsible . // Not so long ago , you could justify coal 's dark side with a single // word : jobs . In the 1920s , when more than 700,000 workers worked in the // mines , it was plausible to argue that miners were the backbone of the // economy . Today there are more florists in America than there are coal // miners . And if coal mining were the sure-fire ticket to wealth and prosperity // that many in the industry claim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the past 150 years or so , more than 13 billion tons of // coal have been carted out of the Mountain State . What do West Virginians // have to show for it ? The lowest median household income in the nation , a // literacy rate in the southern coalfields that 's about the same as Kabul 's , and // a generation of young people who are abandoning their home state to seek // their fortunes elsewhere . // The argument that cheap power is vital to keeping American // manufacturers competitive also is suspect . At a time when U.S. auto // manufacturers spend more money on health care for their workers than on // steel for their cars , it 's increasingly hard to make the case that cheap // electricity is a major factor in keeping jobs from being exported to Asia . By // contrast , a full-blown push for clean energy could unleash a jobs bonanza // that would make what happened in Silicon Valley in the 1990s look like a // bake sale . // What 's most remarkable about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booms , which were driven by an overwhelming exuberance , this one is // driven by overpowering fear : fear that the world is running out of energy , fear // that America is losing its edge , fear of relinquishing the industrial age belief // that we can drill and mine our way to peace and prosperity , and , most of all , // fear that if we do n't burn more coal , we will put not only the economic health // of the nation at risk but civilization itself . " Have you ever been in a blackout ? " // one coal executive asked me while I was researching this book . " Do you // remember how dark the whole world gets ? Do you remember how scary it is ? " // Growing up in California , I had a firsthand look at the devil 's bargain of // progress .

I loved // my computer , and I loved the freedom and prosperity that came with it , but I // could never rid myself of the sense that the wonders of the digital world had // come at a high cost . // When I began research on this book , I felt an immediate and // unexpected connection with many people who had grown up in Appalachian // coal towns . Many of them had fled the world they grew up in ( as I had ) and // looked back on it with a particular kind of sorrow that was very familiar to me. // This note from Jennifer Stock , a thirty-five-year-old West Virginia native who // now lives in Seattle , is typical : // I grew up in Logan , West Virginia . When I was a teenager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a tall fire lookout tower on the top that // was great fun to climb . You could see so many ridges from it ; the hills just // went on and on . Last time I tried to go back there , a few years ago , there // were all sorts of fences in the way . The coal companies are as ruthless to // the environment now as they used to be toward their " employees . " Strip // mining and " mountain top removal " are turning the area into a landscape from // hell , and to add insult to injury , the profits reaped from these efforts still // completely elude the inhabitants of the land . And then these people are // blamed for their ignorance and poverty because it is easier for their fellow // citizens to think that the ugliness is due to individual moral failing ( " lazy // rednecks " ) than to the economic system in which we all participate , by // which we are all culpable. // Until I was forty years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a // kid , I 'd visited hydroelectric dams in the Sierra Nevada foothills and wind // farms above San Francisco Bay . These sights made generating electricity // seem easy and natural , like growing wheat or getting a suntan . It gave me // the idea  --  one that I clung to for years  --  that it really did n't matter if I left the // light on in the other room , because it just meant the water turbines and the // windmills had to spin a little longer . Of course , this is precisely the kind of // blue-state ignorance that red staters scorn , and justifiably so , since the red // states often bear the burden of the blue states ' cluelessness . ( Half the // electricity in Los Angeles , for example , is imported from coal-fired power // plants in Nevada and New Mexico . ) But it is also the kind of cluelessness // that power companies have spent years encouraging . If you doubt this , just // try deciphering the spinning wheels on the electric meter outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the more they isolate consumers // from the true costs and consequences of their kilowatts , the more successful // the companies will be . // I lost my innocence in the summer of 2001 , when the New York // Times Magazine sent me down to West Virginia to write about the surprising // comeback of coal during the early days of the Bush administration . // I began my research by visiting one of the largest mines in West // Virginia , Hobet 21 , which is owned by Arch Coal , the second-biggest coal // company in America . When I pulled up to the mine gate , I was a few minutes // early for my meeting with a mine engineer , so I got out of the car and // wandered around . Down by the railroad tracks , I confronted a large pile of the // most beautiful black rocks I had ever seen . They were black beyond black // and seemed to pull the light out of the sky around them . It took me a // moment to realize that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I visited several coal mines and // talked with the engineers who worked in them . I drove to Cabin Creek , a // narrow valley south of Charleston , West Virginia , where , in 1913 , mining // company thugs opened fire with Gatling guns on their own workers . I flew in a // small plane over the southern coalfields , getting a bird's-eye view of the // devastation wrought by mountaintop removal mining . I visited filled-in creeks // and drove around with a local politician who explained to me with a straight // face that flattening West Virginia was actually a good thing , because the // state needed more level ground for golf courses . // All of this was quite eye-opening to me . I felt as if I had stumbled // into the gritty underbelly of modern life , the dark , dirty place where the real // work is done and the real deals are cut . // The most memorable moment of that trip  --  and , in some ways , // the real beginning of this book  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of the powerful West Virginia Coal Association . We met at the bar at the // Marriott hotel in Charleston , not far from Raney 's office . Raney is a short , // dapper man with a folksy West Virginia drawl . He was dressed that night in // an expensive suit and nice tie , looking more like a Beltway politician than a // man who grew up in a coal camp . It was less than a year after the 2000 // election , and Raney 's Beltway credentials were at an all-time high after his // having helped deliver the state of West Virginia  --  and the Oval Office  --  to // President Bush . // But it was n't Raney 's political connections that impressed me. // Nor was it his defense of mountaintop removal mining as a necessary evil if // West Virginia is to compete with coal mines in other states . It was what he // said about technology . " The thing that people do n't realize , " Raney // drawled , " is that if it were n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // no Yahoo !

" Did you know that it takes more // electricity to charge up a Palm than it does to run an ordinary refrigerator ? // And that every time you order a book from Amazon , you burn over three // pounds of coal ? " // I did n't know that . Later , I would find out that his calculations were // wildly exaggerated . But his larger point about the interconnectedness of the // dirty life of the mines and the sparkly pixels on my computer screen was // correct . What Raney was really saying to me , I understood later , was this : // You use a computer . You have lights in your house . You watch TV .

In 1893 , the // Chicago World 's Fair gave many Americans their first view of the miraculous // dynamos that turned coal into clean , bright incandescent light .

( His grandfather and great- // grandfather were both presidents , and his brother ran the Union Pacific // railroad . ) For Adams , the sight of the coal-fired dynamos was a sign that // American life was about to change irrevocably . He felt the forty-foot dynamos // as a moral force , much as the early Christians felt the Cross . And it // frightened him . As Adams put it , " Chicago asked in 1893 for the first time the // question whether the American people knew where they were driving . " // A few words about the organization of this book .

By organizing the book this way , I hope to give a sense // of the broad impact that coal has on our lives . Too often , debates about // energy degenerate into arcane discussions about the regulatory minutiae of // sulfur dioxide emissions or flaws in the mathematical algorithms used to // calculate changes in the earth 's average temperature over the past // millennium .

I do n't mean to suggest that there are n't lots of well-meaning // people in the coal industry or that many of the engineers I met are n't brilliant . // Keeping the lights on in a nation of 300 million people is a job // that 's as challenging and complex in its own way as putting a man on the // moon . I mean simply that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // technological change is never to reinvent the wheel ; it is to figure out new // ways to keep the old wheels rolling . This is hardly surprising  --  what industry // plots its own obsolescence ? But for me , experiencing the coal industry was // a bizarre inversion of the can-do optimism I 'd grown up with . I sometimes felt // I had stumbled upon a group of mad scientists frantically scheming to invent // their own industrial fountain of youth . // Throughout this book , I frequently use the phrase " Big Coal " as // shorthand for the alliance of coal mining companies , coal-burning utilities , // railroads , lobbying groups , and industry supporters that make the coal // industry such a political force in America . The phrase is not meant to // suggest that the industry is monolithic , or that they all meet together in // smoke-filled rooms to cut deals and hammer out grand strategies . Obviously , // there are diverse players in the industry , with diverse points of view . You will // meet many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that the coal industry , like // the auto industry , the oil industry , the telecommunications industry , and just // about every other multibillion-dollar industry , can be identified by certain // common goals and pursuits . The phrase " Big Coal " is meant to suggest that // commonality , as well as to remind the reader of the power and influence of // the players who are involved . // Finally , a word about the many coal miners , power plant // engineers , and railroad workers I met in the course of reporting this book . // Whatever criticisms I may have of Big Coal , none of it should be taken as a // sign of disrespect for the difficult , dangerous work done by these men and // women on the frontlines . Keeping America powered up is not an easy job , // and the people who do it deserve our admiration and our thanks . They // certainly have mine . //                   @ @
