<p> London - To find David Adjaye 's latest building , a visitor must travel 3 miles beyond the famous Tower Bridge to a low-income , ethnically diverse area in East London unlikely to find tourists . <p> A group of apartment high-rises linked to an arcade shopping area known as the Chrisp Street Market - all part of a failed 1960s utopian attempt at urban renewal - has faded into a mass of dinginess , dirt and graffiti . <p> To create a library for this unlikely neighborhood , Adjaye wrapped a building over a one-story row of shops , giving the new structure a faade of playfully interspersed panels of colored and clear glass that brashly stands out from everything around it . <p> " I wanted it to feel like a bit of a jewel in a place where jewels are n't supposed to be found , " Adjaye said . <p> Building jewels in unexpected parts of London is the 37-year-old Ghanaian architect 's stock in trade , making him one of the city 's hottest stars in the field . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he is the big thing now , " said Caroline Roux , a design writer for The Guardian who penned a spread on the architect for a British edition of Vogue magazine . <p> Adjaye hopes to transfer that success to the United States , as he begins work on a **25;575;TOOLONG building for the Museum of Contemporary Art/Denver . It is expected to be his first completed project in the United States , with a scheduled opening in fall 2006 . <p> The new structure will stand on a lot tucked into a loft project in the Central Platte Valley at the corner of 15th and Delgany streets , diagonally across from the new headquarters of Gates Rubber Co . <p> As planning begins in earnest on the Denver project , workers nearly 5,000 miles away are installing the furnishings in the library , the most recent of what the borough of Tower Hamlets has branded " New Idea Stores . " <p> It is an apt moniker in connection with Adjaye . New ideas have been his trademark since he and a classmate designed and furnished a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project that immediately gained notice . <p> The architect likes to break the rules , conceiving buildings that can be raw and gritty yet still exude a sometimes unexpected beauty . He manipulates space and light in unusual ways and exalts humble building materials , such as particle board . <p> The big question is how his unconventional approach will play in Denver . With a few exceptions , this city has not been particularly receptive to adventuresome architecture . <p> Offering at least one voice of support is Tracy Stahl , a Gates employee who was crossing the Millennium Bridge on a recent afternoon . <p> " If it 's going to be a museum of modern art , it should be very creative , " Stahl said . <p> Despite Stahl 's enthusiasm , Denver architect Michael Brendle said a " phobia " exists in historic Lower Downtown against anything that might contradict the traditional " LoDo look . " <p> " I do n't think he ( Adjaye ) should conform to that , " Brendle said , " and I do n't think he should have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and what it 's trying to accomplish . But I think that 's something he 'll have to hurdle over . " <p> " Kind of the anti-DAM " <p> When the contemporary art museum 's search committee set out to find an architect for the institution 's proposed new home , it wanted one that could not only handle the job but was also at just the right point in his development . <p> " We wanted it to be a pivotal building in the career of the architect we were going to pick , yet we wanted them to have the skill and experience and be ready to do it , " said Boulder architect Jim Logan , the committee 's head . <p> Adjaye 's selection probably surprised many people who attended his lecture , which was among the driest and least compelling of the six candidates . But the committee took into account a range of factors , including site visits by some of its members . <p> And when the group gathered to make its decision , it was quickly clear that Adjaye was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work stand out , Logan said , but the committee liked him as a person and thought he would make a good collaborator . <p> Michael Jenson , an assistant professor of architecture and urban design at the University of Colorado 's College of Architecture and Planning called the choice risky but not surprising . <p> " They wanted that kind of risk , " he said . " They see themselves as kind of the anti-DAM , and so where DAM ( Denver Art Museum ) got this kind of proven person , ( Daniel ) Libeskind ( for its addition ) , they wanted to take the opposite tack . " <p> As he begins to develop a design , Adjaye will face several challenges , including adjusting to working in this country . <p> " I lived in Europe for five years , so I kind of understand , " Jenson said . " There 's a huge difference between the way architects are perceived here versus their perception in Europe . They 're much more respected in Europe . They hold greater power over projects . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about $5 million , not much considering the Denver Art Museum is spending $90.5 million for its considerably larger addition . But Adjaye is used to small price tags . <p> " He works very well when the budget is limited , " Roux said . " That 's when the ideas appear more strongly . I think it 's the right-scale job at the moment . " <p> Too successful too fast ? <p> Although some of Adjaye 's earlier projects attracted attention , his career took fire with the completion of the Elektra Housein 2000 . It ignores or perhaps defies the traditional brick structures in its East London neighborhood . <p> Because the interior is illuminated almost exclusively by skylights and a rear light well , the house has virtually no standard windows . Its street faade consists entirely of a monolithic black wall . <p> " When plans for it were first published , this modest house caused something of a furor in the design press : it was praised by some for its individualism and criticized by others for its uncompromising philosophy , " wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Design . " <p> He called the house an " extreme response " to the question of domestic space and noted that some people would likely find its austerity alienating . " Yet it remains a triumph of individualism and resourceful thinking , " he wrote . <p> Elektra House took Adjaye to a new level and led to a spate of commissions . In 2000 , he left a partnership to found his own firm , which has grown from eight employees to 36 and will probably soon expand . <p> Roux even worries that Adjaye might be gaining success too quickly . She 's glad he did n't win commissions for two high-profile projects he recently sought - a new British embassy in Warsaw , Poland , and the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York . <p> " As a practitioner you need time to form your ideas and for them to gel , " she said . " And if you 're actually too busy working ... you 're not exploring ideas anymore . " <p> For the moment , London critics are virtually unanimous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his peers , especially " any of the slightly drier , more modernist architects , " have reservations about him , some no doubt stemming from jealousy . <p> Tony Fretton , a noted London architect who beat out Adjaye for the commission for the embassy in Poland , was reluctant to discuss his colleague . <p> " You can quote me as saying he 's very charming and accomplished and very much in the limelight in England at the moment , " he said . " Would that be enough , without being short about it ? " <p> Several factors have helped elevate Adjaye as something of a media darling , including , as he is quick to acknowledge , the novelty that he is black in a field where there are virtually no major black practitioners . <p> It has not hurt that some of his early clients were celebrities , such as actor Ewan McGregor and fashion photographer Juergen Teller , and that he is personable , with a warm smile and ready laugh . <p> " He 's media-friendly , and that 's spectacularly powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be arrogant , he 's not . And that makes him appropriate in the 21st century in ways that other architects are not . " <p> Modesty trumps glitz <p> That Adjaye likes to buck the status quo is signaled by the location of his office in a tough part of North London 's Hoxton district . It is so far off the beaten track that even the city 's street-savvy cabbies have to look it up in a city guide . <p> The firm , Adjaye/Associates , occupies the ground floor of a slightly run-down , four-story brick warehouse building from the early 20th century ; most people probably pass by without even noticing . <p> Other than a conference table , which Adjaye designed , and the Mies van der Rohe chairs around it , little is fancy about the all-white office geared more to practicality than glitz . Instead of blinds , for example , black paper has been taped to the upper part of the windows . <p> " I very quickly realized that the architecture I 'm interested in practicing does n't need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not really a sort of High Street product . I liked the idea of just being embedded in a very ordinary context of London . " <p> Adjaye 's unconventional approach is also reflected in the unusual juxtapositions of books on his office shelves , each pointing to a different part of his wide-ranging and unconventional background . <p> A book on famed Japanese architect Tadao Ando rests next to one on contemporary African-American artist Lorna <p> Simpson . A monograph on 18th-century English painter Thomas Gainsborough leans against one titled " North African Villages . " <p> From the time he was born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents in 1966 , Adjaye has followed a different path . Because his father was a diplomat , his family shifted to an array of countries in his early childhood , including Kenya , Tanzania , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . <p> When he was 10 , a younger brother contracted a flu that went out of control , leading to severe mental and physical handicaps . Because of this crisis , his parents decided to move the family somewhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer to London . <p> Although those were his last years living in Africa , Adjaye has taken pains to maintain ties to his heritage . After the family moved to London , for example , he asked his mother to speak to him only in her native language , Twi . <p> And on a recent day , he wore a gold-and-green shirt with a bold Ashanti pattern . He has shirts like it custom-tailored for him in Ghana , using native cloth and a French design he particularly likes . <p> " I feel that I have another set of resources ( in my background ) which really are below the radar for a lot of people , " he said . " And that has to do with the rest of the world , which is not investigated in that mainstream . I have a perception of an Islamic world and what that means . I know how an African tribal world negotiates itself and how that impacts on space . " <p> Also propelling Adjaye in a different direction is his unusual educational background . For his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , choosing to enroll at the Royal College of Art , because he wanted a more broad-based experience . <p> It was there that he met and befriended some of the students , such as Chris Ofili , who have become art stars and also clients . <p> Since those days , he has maintained close ties to the art world , designing a space for Ofili 's art at the British Pavilion at the 2003 Venice Biennale , which included a prismatic glass ceiling , and a temporary building last year for the Frieze art show in London . <p> Cultural projects always will be a central component of his firm 's activities , Adjaye said , which helps explains why he is so excited to receive the Denver commission - his first art museum . <p> " This job has immediately become the most important job in my office , " he said . " It fulfills a lot of the ambitions that I personally have set for myself . " <p> " Form follows ideas " <p> To get some sense of what the Museum of Contemporary Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects as a guide , but not in a direct stylistic way . Unlike some architects , such as Frank Gehry , Adjaye does not have an immediately recognizable " look . " <p> What remains consistent throughout his work is a determination to confront each project on its own terms , and a desire to challenge the mainstream , especially classic modernism , which he believes has been rigid . <p> " I 'm more interested in this position , which is not about a form-follows-function strategy but form follows ideas , " he said . " And ideas are dependent on a lot of things , not just a definition of function , which I think can become very narrow and actually lead to banality . " <p> He is part of a new wave of British architects who emerged since Prince Charles ' infamous denunciation of contemporary architecture 20 years ago . Adjaye and his contemporaries are trying to define a new kind of urban building . <p> " I think David represents a new generation which recognizes that the city is a mess , " Roux said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fragmented thing , especially in London . It 's so multicultural . There 's no single solution . " <p> Adjaye accepts such a situation as a given and plunges right into it , creating buildings meant to compete for attention in this topsy-turvy environment . <p> " I 'm not interested in an architecture where you understand it by just visually looking at it , " Adjaye said . " I 'm interested in an architecture which forces you engage it and to experience it before you form your views . " <p> His conceptual approach can be seen in a proposed building to be shared by two London visual arts groups . He has kept the usual 60/40 proportion of wall space to windows but discarded the typically symmetrical window placement . <p> Instead , the windows along the building 's faade widen from left to right . But when viewed from the end of the structure , they all look the same size . <p> Another constant is Adjaye 's desire to make materials palpable . He often does this by taking them out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in airplanes . <p> " He 's actually using his materials to say something else , " Roux said . " He 's using them to evoke some response . He 's using them to confuse you . He 's using them to make you notice . " <p> In a formerly rough neighborhood of East London near what not long ago was a brothel is Adjaye 's Dirty House , which he coated with the same fudge-colored , bitumen paint the city of London uses on light poles and the like to ward off graffiti and handbills . <p> " The detractors would say that 's a gimmick , " Roux said . " But actually it 's not . It 's actually fulfilling a very straightforward function , which is you ca n't fly post on the exterior of this house . It 's also telling you a lot about where this house is . " <p> Pragmatic about fame <p> Adjaye admits he is entering a critical phase of his career , as he begins to design his first larger , public buildings . He <p> realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The project that is going to be his Achilles ' heel has n't emerged yet , " Roux said . " He 's 37 now . I think that 's spectacularly young . I ca n't think of anyone else who has achieved so much at his age . A young architect is 48 , not 35 . " <p> For now , Adjaye is riding a wave of success . But the architect knows adulation can disappear as fast as it comes , and he professes to be unconcerned if such an eventuality occurs . <p> " I 'm only interested in my work , and if I 'm suddenly no longer the person , fine , " he said . " I 'm enjoying my spotlight moment . It 's great . Who would n't ? It 's amazing to have the attention . <p> " But it 's never been what turns me on . The whole agenda behind this is to be able to manipulate and get involved in space-making within society . "
