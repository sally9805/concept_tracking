LONDON  --  Swelling oil and gas revenues are fueling boom times in Russia . Trouble is , they 're also bankrolling its military resurgence and , as one British diplomat puts it , " a deterioration of Russian behavior . " How to react to a seemingly more menacing Kremlin has the European Union leaders in a quandary . European foreign ministers , meeting earlier this month in Portugal , agreed that a unified , tougher line with Moscow is needed . But they 've yet to agree on just what it will be . " It 's a brand-new game , but Europe does n't know what the game is yet and is n't sure how to play it , " says Alyson Bailes , an expert on European security at the University of Iceland . One thing 's for certain , however . The Bear is restless and prowling again . The ministers ' level of concern ratcheted up a few days before their meeting when , on September 6 , a pack of eight Russian long-range strategic bombers  --  Tu-95s or , in the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NATO-patrolled international airspace over the waters of the Arctic Sea and North Atlantic . The aircraft , following a route commonly used by Soviet bombers during the Cold War , seemed to be on the kind of reconnaissance mission that ended 16 years ago with the demise of the Soviet Union . Scramble the jets . Norway scrambled two F-16 jets to shadow the bombers , though eventually four Tornado jets from Britain 's Royal Air Force took over and stayed with the Bears until they turned toward home . The incident was the most egregious Russian probing of NATO air defenses by the 1950s-vintage bombers , but not the first . Several similar episodes involving Russian aircraft and NATO jets have occurred since May ( and there was another incident late last week , involving two Russian Tu-160 " Blackjack " bombers ) . British Foreign Secretary David Miliband 's reaction : " The best place to discuss relations with Russia is around the table , not at 35,000 feet . " The provocative Russian flights are n't the only Cold War-type saber rattling emanating from Moscow these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , resumed test-firing missiles , and last week detonated what it claims is the world 's most powerful nonnuclear bomb . Moreover , it has shown a willingness to use its considerable energy resources as a weapon for political advantage . Why the boorish behavior ? Russia has felt , somewhat justifiably , snubbed by the West in the years since the Soviet empire 's collapse . And it 's particularly dismayed over American plans to install missile-defense interceptors in former Warsaw Pact countries Poland and the Czech Republic . The military muscle-flexing is " a showcase designed by Russia to remind the world that it 's back , " says James Nixey , who heads the Russian program at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London . Still , it 's worth keeping the Kremlin 's posturing in perspective . Its armed forces were a basket case after the Soviet Union crumbled , and they largely remain in dire condition . And despite the uptick in defense spending by Moscow , the amount is minuscule by U.S. and NATO standards . Also , though Russia 's adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for western investment and markets makes a military attack of any sort highly unlikely . " Calling it a new Cold War is extremely tempting but off the mark . It 's really a different situation , " Bailes says . " These are Cold War tools being used in a new environment . " Where 's NATO ? Nevertheless , Moscow 's continuing provocations are something Europe ca n't ignore . Constructing a unified response wo n't be easy , however , mainly because some of the EU ? S 27 members are heavily dependent on Russian energy and fear a cutoff of supplies . Also , the addition to the EU of some Baltic states  --  historically suspicious of Russian intentions  --  has helped harden the union 's overall attitude toward Moscow . The EU is also unused to dealing with Russia on these kinds of issues , since historically that has been NATO 's role . But these days , NATO is otherwise occupied with the war on terrorism and the fighting in Afghanistan . Europe could play some tough political and economic cards . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G-8 , the group of the world 's leading industrialized democracies , or work to bar its expected ( and much desired ) membership in the World Trade Organization . But responses that harsh would be painful to the West , too . And nothing Russia has done so far would seem to merit reactions so heavy-handed . Look instead for Europe to use more carrot than stick to get Moscow to modify its behavior , perhaps seeking to further integrate Russia into the West 's economic sphere . Christopher Hill , a University of Cambridge professor of international relations , says Europe should start by building upon the existing energy interdependence between East and West . What 's needed , he says , is a more regulated , stable framework " so that Russia does not see its energy resources as leverage to use against the West . " The payoff for Russia : fair prices and a mechanism to raise them when market conditions warrant . In the meantime , Russia is likely to keep up the prodding and the military swashbuckling . But that could prove fruitful if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbor . Says Bailes : " Russia may be doing the right thing in the wrong way .
