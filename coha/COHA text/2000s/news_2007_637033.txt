<p> Daytona Beach , Fla.  --  In the 43 years since James Hylton first climbed behind the wheel of a NASCAR race car , he rarely has gotten a reception like the one he got at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday . <p> Hylton stole the show . <p> Even with two major story lines  --  Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya beginning his first full season in Nextel Cup and Toyota becoming the first foreign nameplate in NASCAR 's elite division  --  Hylton , age 72 , dominated fan attention in his quest to become the oldest driver to compete in the Nextel Cup Series . <p> It 's an uphill battle to say the least . Hylton 's speed of 179.637 mph in time trials  --  David Gilliland won the pole at 186.320 mph  --  means he 'll have to start on the back row of Thursday 's 150-mile qualifiers and will have to have a strong run to get into Sunday 's Daytona 500 . But his pedestrian time in qualifying did not dim the enthusiasm of fans and drivers , past and present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck to his qualifying car , fans yelled his name as he strolled through the garage . As he strolled past a chain-link fence separating fans from drivers , he walked to the fence and signed autograph after autograph . Those fans did n't seem to care that he looked more like a grandfather than a race driver . " I 'm flabbergasted , " he said of the fans ' response . <p> The fans seemed grateful to have any driver stop and sign their souvenirs , especially since many superstars walked right past them . But they especially liked Hylton . <p> " You 're awesome , " one said . A young fan asked Hylton how old he was . <p> " I 'm the oldest driver out here , " he responded , which prompted one young lady to say , " And the best-looking , too ! " <p> But Hylton is more than a novelty . His resume , while largely forgotten , is impressive . <p> He nearly won the championship of the Cup circuit in his rookie season of 1966 , finishing second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in six of his first seven seasons , and he did it despite racing as an independent on a shoestring budget . He even won a couple of times , at Richmond and Talladega , leading many to consider him as NASCAR 's most successful independent driver of all time . <p> In recent years , he has struggled with stomach bleeding that took him out of the race car for a time . Even when he did drive , he usually ran in the ARCA series , a minor league stock-car circuit . On many weeks , he put younger drivers in his car , but that all changed last spring when one potential driver offered only $5,000 per race for the ride . <p> " That 's cigar money , " he said . So he started driving again . <p> " The more I raced , the better I got , " he said . " I got caught up on the modern technical stuff . I lost 29 pounds . " <p> Although he ran the whole season in ARCA and ran one Busch Series race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that division ) , he still flew under the radar . <p> That all changed when he announced his desire to return to the Cup series and attempt to break that circuit 's age record , held by Jim Fitzgerald , who raced at Riverside , Calif. , at age 65 . <p> " I 've never seen so much press , " Hylton said . " I guess persistence pays off . " <p> But Hylton 's effort to make the 500 has n't taken place without controversy . Some drivers questioned whether he should be on the track . <p> Hylton 's response : I was here before they were . <p> Car owner Richard Childress , who once raced against Hylton and sold Hylton 's team the No. 58 Chevrolet he drove on Sunday , says he has no worries about his drivers being on the track with an aging star looking for one last hurrah . <p> " He wo n't put anybody in danger , " Childress said . <p> Carl Edwards did n't seem concerned , either . <p> " I hope when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to , " Edwards said . " Hylton seems like a heckuva guy . How could you not pull for him ? " <p> Asked to respond to the naysayers , Hylton 's ever-present smile quickly evaporated . <p> " I 'm not jumping into their party , " he said . " This is my party they 're jumping into . Seniority is the American way , and I 've got the seniority . " <p> But for the most part , he had nearly everyone on his side . <p> As he walked down pit road before qualifying , he came upon Ricky Rudd , whom he first met when Rudd was an 18-year-old driver trying to break into the Cup circuit . <p> " James Harvey Hylton was the first guy that would talk to me back then , " Rudd said , explaining that Hylton , a skilled chassis man and talented driver , freely gave him advice back in the day . Now Rudd found himself answering Hylton 's questions . <p> " We 've kind of gone full circle , " Rudd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me , " Hylton said with a chuckle . <p> Hylton 's relationship with Rudd is n't the only thing in his life that has come full circle . <p> His latest racing endeavor is backed by the well-stocked wallet of his boyhood best friend , Josiah Cephus " J.C . " Weaver . <p> Weaver , who typically wears a black leather jacket and a black cowboy hat , grew up with Hylton in rural Virginia then moved to Florida and made a fortune in the tile business and developing real estate . <p> " We grew up together on Yellow Mountain Road near Roanoke , " Weaver said . " James ' family was in the hay business , and my father had a sawmill . " <p> Weaver said the car he bought for Hylton is painted orange for a reason . <p> " It 's the closest we could get to the color of those old Case tractors I remember James driving on the farm back in Virginia , " Weaver said . <p> Hylton said he sometimes still ca n't believe his good fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoestring budget . <p> " Mine has not been an easy road , " he said . " Thank goodness I 've stuck with it . But I have wondered , ' How long do you wait for something good to happen to you ? ' Now the question is how long the good fortune will last . I hope it does n't all ride on whether I make this race . " <p> But if he does n't qualify for the Daytona 500 , there 's still Pocono , or Michigan or Kansas City  --  tracks he enjoys and feels comfortable driving on . <p> " If I do n't make this race , I 'll be sad , but I 'll go on , " he said . <p> COUNTDOWN TO THE 500 <p> * Gatorade duels : 2 and 4 p.m .
