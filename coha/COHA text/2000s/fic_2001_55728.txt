Wild Mood Swings 10 . Gone ! 11 . Hot Hot Hot ! ! ! 12 . Just Like Heaven # 1 . In Between Days <p> TEN TIMES LARGER THAN life and twice as sobering , Robert Smith 's visage brooded down from the ceiling of Erin Merkin 's bedroom . Perched on a shadowy staircase , the lead vocalist and lyricist for the British band called the Cure had been captured by the camera in an implacably Gothic moment . His gamin features , layered in white and black makeup , if juxtaposed next to the face of one of his spiritual ancestors  --  Poe or Shelley , perhaps  --  would have caused those infamous mopes to be viewed as positively Pollyanna-ish . Smith wore enough mascara and liner around his sad eyes to impersonate a raccoon , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear black . <p> Most astonishing and compelling , however , was Smith 's hair . A wild pouf of dyed black , Smith 's hairdo appeared less a deliberate look than the result of a lightning strike or unwise tampering with a fuse box . Radiating in every direction like a nest of snakes , the singer 's spiky elflocks projected such a dynamic image that they practically assumed a separate identity . <p> From the giant poster pasted to the ceiling , this postmodern Rimbaud known as Robert Smith glowered down with the classically alluring despair so attractive to sensitive and disaffected youth ( a despair best captured in Smith 's own line , " Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die " ) upon the lone inhabitant of this tidy suburban adolescent 's bedroom , typical save for its Gothic clutter : Erin Merkin . <p> Hopelessly fourteen , Erin lay as if rigidly pinned on her back laterally across her daytime-madeup bed , her clothes and demeanor offering a startling contrast to the frilly pink counterpane . From her bureau-top CD player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy Mr. Smith warbled " To Wish Impossible Things " over and over , bathing the young gift in waves of weltschmerz . <p> Completely kitted out in light-devouring black , from monstrously large boots to loose multi-pocketed cargo pants and on up to a voluminous long-sleeved T-shirt ( advertising a brand of very long nails not sold at hardware stores ) , Erin was instantly recognizable as a stout-hearted acolyte of Mister Smith and Company . A tackle-box 's worth of plastic and metal fixtures serving as jewelry  --  embedded into flesh or simply hanging loose  --  completed her outfit . <p> The only anomaly in Erin 's chosen appearance was her hair . Chin-length , fine and supple and colored like glossy-wet autumn oak leaves , her coif suited more a folk singer or hippie communard than a club-hopping night-gaunt . <p> Erin 's own thoughts must have been focused on this same disfiguring incongruity , for her pale , pretty round face suddenly contorted in a fierce scowl , elevating her silver nose-stud nearly an inch , and she reached up both hands to tug at her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yank her hair out by its roots , but with an admirable healthy tenacity it resisted her best efforts . Finally admitting defeat , Erin released her innocently offensive hair and dug one hand into a lumpy thigh pocket . The hand  --  its chewed nails painted a gruesome shade sold under the name " Ghetto Grit "  --  emerged clutching a small cellphone . Erin prodded its buttons with displaced furiousness . <p> " Hello , Elise ? Yeah , it 's me . No , she would n't let me . I hate her ! I do n't care if she is my mother . She does n't understand me and she never will ! Yeah , well , you 're lucky . Listen , meet me at the boardwalk . Homework ? Are you a total pus-bucket or what ? Okay , see you there . " <p> Erin repocketed the phone and stood up . Snatching a backpack from a hook ( the pack 's fabric plastered with stickers ) , Erin clomped out , her boots raising a din as if every last British POW were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From his coign , the implacable Robert Smith surveyed the empty room , his dour expression syncing most portentously with the unattended CD player 's pronouncement that " The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears , and all I wish is gone away . " <p> 2 . Standing on a Beach The boardwalk stretched empty under a November sun pale as cottage cheese . The arcades and vendor stalls running parallel to the boardwalk along its western edge wore protective plywood cladding across their doors and windows , against the coming winter . The unpopulated beach beyond the railings immediately to the east , its lifeguard towers stored away now in nearby sheds , assumed a primeval cast , as if the patient shore and questing sea had stolidly consorted just so for millennia without human intervention . <p> The stomping walk with which Erin had departed her bedroom had abated in fury , acquiring a more resigned and leaden tone . She moved her weighty boots in a desultory manner , gradually approaching a bench that faced the sea . She dropped down , slinging her pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , she gazed pensively toward the horizon . Then , a chill wind caused her to shiver and dig in her knapsack . From it she removed a leather vest adorned with emblems and pins . After donning this ineffective garment over her long-sleeved shirt , she continued to root through her bag , coming up with a pack of bidis and a lighter . Soon the maritime-scented air was overlaid with a sweet herbal perfume . <p> Erin puffed meditatively for a time , apparently heedless of her surroundings , until without apparent cue she lifted her pack of Indian cigarettes out of her lap , upward and backward over her shoulder . <p> " Thanks . " <p> Elise had arrived , strolling up directly behind Erin . Now the second girl took a bidi and lit up also , before swinging around to share the bench with her friend . <p> Elise Bamonte evinced an obvious spiritual sisterhood with Erin . The restricted palette of her wardrobe bespoke a shared allegiance to all things Goth . But Elise completed the regulation look with a tangle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an untidy gull 's nest on a cliff . <p> Erin cast a covetous glance at her friend 's hair , then stubbed out her cigarette and flicked the butt away . <p> " My god , I ca n't stand it ! Look at your hair ! It 's so awesome ! " <p> Elise primped , proud of her finest feature . " It has n't seen a comb in six months now . " <p> Erin batted at the silky drapery of her own hair . " What I would n't give to get rid of this mess . But she wo n't let me ! " <p> " Tell me why again ? " <p> " My father . She keeps reminding me of how much he ' adored ' my hair . I can change anything else about my looks but that . Jesus , I loved the guy too , and I 'm really sad he 's dead . But it 's like I 'm walking around with his tombstone on my head for two years now . " <p> " Bummer . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " She 'd probably scream and cry and wail so much I 'd feel like shit . Then who knows ? Maybe she 'd kick me out , send me to live with Aunt Gladys . I sure do n't want that . I like my Mom most of the time , and I like my home too . But I ca n't stand this dictator shit . " <p> Elise finished her smoke . " What about running away ? " <p> Erin vented a dismissive snort . " Where to ? I do n't want to end up some skanky ancient thirty-year-old slut in a bus depot with like dozens of heroin needles sticking out of me ! " <p> " I do n't know what to say then . Charlotte sometimes  --  " <p> " Oh , the hell with Charlotte ! She 's a spoiled rich bitch . No , I 've got to face it  --  I 'm stuck for good right where I am . " <p> Elise obligingly changed the subject . For half an hour the girls talked about school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about new brands of nail polish . And they discussed items of musical interest , such as the possibility that the Cure might go on tour and play an unannounced free concert at the local civic center , where Elise and Erin would be invited from the front-row audience to come onstage . <p> But eventually , as the sun began to sink lower behind the friends ' backs , Elise announced that she had to go , since her mother would be serving her favorite meal soon : nachos and ramen . <p> " That 's cool , " Erin replied with forced insouciance . " I 'm just going to hang here a little longer . " <p> Elise soon dwindled down the short streets leading back to town . The growing cold prodding her now , Erin stood and descended several steps to the sand . Assuming a woeful look of supreme martyrdom , she began to scuff along the beach , her clodhoppers sending explosive gouts of sand aloft , dragging her knapsack by its straps like some bohemian Christopher Robin pulling a drunken Pooh by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deep Green Sea The eastern sky above the ocean began to purple ; like some lost platoon , a swath of afternoon blue in the celestial west fought to sustain itself against the scarlet sunset on one flank and the encroaching Tyrian shades sweeping in from the other . <p> Erin halted her aimless trudging about half a mile from the amusement center , at an undeveloped spot where only dunes bordered the beach . Here was a site to match her hopelessness : meaningless , barren , windswept , unwired . She faced out to the uncaring waters . <p> Like a sudden eruption of whiteheads , the strongest stars had begun to pimple the night 's complexion . As Erin watched , one errant light detached itself and began to fall . <p> Wide-eyed , the girl observed the falling star grow larger and larger . Its vivid nearby passage through the atmosphere was soon traced by a corona of flame . A sizzling and crackling noise accompanied its wild flight . <p> And then the star fell into the sea with a surprisingly small splash , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminary . " Wow ! Does this mean I get a wish ? I forgot to make one while you were falling  --  though , Mister Stat . Still , what have I got to lose ? Okay , here goes  --  I wish , I wish  --  I wish to get unstuck ! " <p> Dropping down to the sand in an easy half-lotus posture , Erin resolved to await any possible results of her spontaneous appeal to cosmic magic . <p> Her appeal was answered in about twenty minutes . <p> From the surf crawled an unnatural entity Erin could only partially perceive in the waning light . It appeared to have a myriad small candy-striped legs emanating from a body resembling a mass of sodden seaweed . <p> Erin jumped up and began to back away slowly . <p> The creature crawled up to the wrack at the waterline and stopped . Then , in a reassuringly cute canine manner , it shook itself free of water . <p> Immediately Erin beheld a miracle : there before her stood Robert Smith 's living hair . <p> The creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its underside . Whatever body the hair and crawly feet were attached to was practically one-dimensional , a thin scalp . No sensory organs showed . But whatever the creature lacked in substantial torso , it made up for in pelt . Its black spiky Medusan tumult of hair could have outfitted both Mr. and Mrs. Robert Smith , with enough to spare for an heir . <p> Instinctively reassured by such a delightful appearance , Erin inched closer to the sea-creature . <p> " Here , little guy , here I am . Can I pet you ? " <p> Erin extended her hand . The creature quivered playfully in response . <p> Then in a flash it leaped onto her arm , scuttled up to the top of her head , and clamped down with every last delicate yet exceedingly sharp leg . <p> 4 . Why Ca n't I Be You ? For a microsecond or three , Erin felt as if a million hungry children were digging into her skull with blunt spoons . She tried to scream , but only a gargled cacophony emerged . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her ears filled with oscillating sourceless squeals . The stud in her nose seemed to flame white-hot . Muscles twitched up and down her body like a bowl of earthworms goosed by electric current , and her mouth filled with a banquet of tastes known and unknown . <p> Then normality resumed . All pain vanished . Her senses reported familiar surroundings : sand , sky , stars and sea ; swoosh of cold wind and scent of drying kelp . <p> And the creature who had attacked her ? Gone , or still resting on her seemingly unburdened skull ? <p> Tentatively , Erin reached up to the level of her chin . With uncommon gratitude , she touched her despised long sleek hair <p> But at the instant she did so , all her hair was retracted upward , like a snapped rollershade or slurped spaghetti ! <p> " Eeek ! " Erin stifled her squeals after the first one . Very carefully , as if balancing a weightless book on her head , she bent down to retrieve her pack . From within , she removed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusky sky and city streetlamp spillover for her to see herself faintly . <p> Call her Robert Smith 's female clone . An extravagant mass of dark twisted hair topped Erin 's skull . <p> As she studied herself incredulously in the small glass , she saw a tendril of hair extend itself downward . The hair coiled around the mirror and angled the compact to its satisfaction . <p> " Yes , that 's better . Thank you for the loan of your eyes and cranium . Quite a nice fit . " <p> The voice possessed a self-assured genderless vibrancy , and seemed to emanate impossibly from a spot only an inch away from Erin 's ears . <p> " Who  --  who 's talking ? " <p> " It is I , your new friend . " <p> " Are you using telepathy on me ? " <p> " Not as conventionally defined . I do have access to your neurological states , but reading them directly is awkward and time-consuming . However , I can tap and interpret your nerve impulses just before they reach your vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , I supply my responses direct to your auditory inputs . Much easier than trying to tamper with the complexities of your cortex . " <p> " So no one but me can hear you ? " <p> " Correct . " <p> Erin pocketed her mirror and covered her ears with her hands . She mimed the words " Say something " without actually speaking . <p> " A very clever ' test of my statements . I can see you possess a sharp intelligence , Erin . " <p> Erin dropped her hands . " Thanks  --  I guess . That 's what all my teachers say , just before they flunk me . Wait a minute  --  how did you know my name ? " <p> " As I said , I have access to your brain and its contents . " <p> " This is too creepy . If you were a guy , I 'd freak . But since you 're just some kind of cuddly alien like ET , I suppose I can handle it . Do you have a name ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cool ! Did you know- " <p> "  --  that is the title of a song by your favorite musical group ? Yes , of course . " <p> Erin was beginning to relax a bit . The situation was improbable and spooky , but countless movies , videogames and television shows had prepared her for just such a visit . So far , there had been no bad fallout from her contact with this creature . All she had gotten was the hairdo she had perpetually longed for . <p> That thought raised another . " What happened to my real hair ? " <p> " I ingested it , to replenish myself after my arduous crawl to land . I assumed you would not require your original hair for cosmetic purposes as long as we were bonded . " <p> That last word gave Erin a chill . " Are you going to use me like a puppet now or something ? " <p> " Not unless I have to in the course of my mission . " <p> " And what might that be ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jupiter Crash This last statement from Caterpillar did not reassure Erin . " What do you mean ? You 're gon na make the whole world look like Europe ? Will we all have to listen to French accordian music or German polkas ? What about the food ? I am not eating snails ! " <p> Caterpillar 's voice grew irritated . " You are confused . I am referring to my homeworld , Europa , one of the moons of Jupiter . " <p> " You 're planning to give Earth some kind of makeover so it looks like your moon ? Why ? " <p> " Perhaps you recall several years ago the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy with our primary ? " <p> " Hel-lo ! Do I look like some kind of poindexter to you ? Why would I ever have paid any attention to such a thing when I was like ten years old and still playing with Barbie dolls ? " <p> " Allow me to provide a video summary then . " <p> A vivid waking dream instantly filled Erin 's vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeballs . Her vantage was a point in near orbit around the titanic mottled globe of Jupiter . As she stared in fascination at the immense fantastic landscape of the gas giant , Comet Shoemaker-Levy flashed into the scene , shortly thereafter impacting cataclysmically with the big planet . <p> Control of her vision returned . " Wow ! Some fireworks ! ' <p> " Indeed . My race became very alarmed at this event . Despite living beneath two miles of ice on a separate globe , we realized that we were not safe from any future such events . We needed to develop a second habitat for our kind . But the choice of your world was also determined by an additional factor . " <p> " What was that ? " <p> " We became aware through monitored radio broadcasts that your national space agency was developing plans to send a probe to our world , to drill through our holy ceiling of protective ice and penetrate our happy seas . This we could not allow . So I was sent alone in a one-way interplanetary ice-pod to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not repress a guffaw . " Not to put you down , Caterpillar , but how is a lone talking ragmop going to conquer a whole world ? Especially when you 're attached to me ? Do you have any idea how powerless teenage girls like me are in this country ? " <p> " Powerless ? Did you not render the Backstreet Boys millionaires ? " <p> " Eeyeuw ! Believe me , I had nothing to do with that ! " <p> " No matter . My plan will soon become apparent , once we reach your house , which I intend to use as my world-converting headquarters . " <p> Erin crossed her arms defiantly across her chest . " And what if I just plant myself here and wo n't budge ? " <p> " Alas , that is when I find myself with the unpleasant necessity of taking control of your motor functions . " <p> And with that statement , Erin found herself trotting confidently across the beach much against her will , heading straight for home . <p> " Oh , no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body ? " <p> " No , but I hate running ! It 's like gym class  --  you get all sweaty ! " <p> " Perspiration is good . I will extend portions of myself to absorb it for my sustenance if you permit . " <p> " No , no ! I 'll sweat , I 'll sweat ! " <p> 6 . Fascination Street While she jogged helplessly home , Erin was treated to another personal screening of an educational filmstrip . This time the experience included multisensory stimulation as well . It was frightening to realize that she was galloping blind and deaf through the however lightly trafficked night streets of her town . But Erin had to assume the Caterpillar knew what it was doing . <p> Erin was a swimmer in the lightless , tasty , echoic seas of Europa . Despite the lack of sunshine , she could somehow perceive in full color a wild ecology . Teeming with garish and bizarre alien lifeforms , both mobile and sessile , dotted with smoking volcanic-vent oases , the homeworld of Caterpillar seemed a cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim by . A few moved independently with a scalp-flexing maneuver , but most rode a variety of host creatures , from long sleek sharklike beings to bloated floaters . Erin assumed that the other Caterpillars controlled their mounts just as she herself was now being ridden . <p> Closer and closer to a heavenly dome  --  dimly sensed at first , then more and more vivid  --  Erin swam , the pleasantly warm waters sluicing by . Finally the jagged , faintly luminescent underside of the miles of ice that enclosed the Europan biosphere loomed above her . Erin felt her soul fill with a deep religious appreciation of this miracle shield that allowed her world to exist . It felt like attending Christmas and Easter services rolled into one . <p> Europa vanished , and apprehension of her immediate surroundings returned . She was almost home . <p> " You see now why we could never allow Earthlings to sacrilegiously penetrate our icy mantle . And once your own planet is encased in a similar crust , any of your species lucky enough to adapt and survive will certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " We 're a very ungrateful bunch of bastards . " <p> " No matter . We are highly altruistic , enough to compensate for your bad manners . " <p> Erin came to a stop on her doorstep . " If I restore control to you , will you promise not to run away ? " Erin sighed . " All right . I do n't have anywhere else to go anyway . I 'm certainly not going to walk into a police station and announce that my hair wants to be taken to our leader . " <p> " I do not care about your leaders . They are irrelevant . " <p> Erin chuckled . " You 're here only an hour and already you sound like talk radio . " <p> " We have learned much from your unwise profligate broadcasting . " <p> The front door swung open , and Erin 's mother stood framed within . <p> A bit taller still than her rebellious adolescent offspring , Anne Merkin shared Erin 's stubborn round face , engraved with age-accumulated worry-lines . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few tendrils escaping . Did they stir with impossible sympathy toward Erin 's new do ? No , it was only the play of shadows . <p> Dressed in robe and slippers , Anne wore an expression that any parent would have recognized instantly : a blend of concern , anger and puzzlement . <p> " What are you doing out at this hour , young lady ? And why did n't you  --  My god , what have you done to your hair ! " <p> " Mom , can we not have this discussion in the front yard , please ? " <p> Anne Merkin grabbed her daughter by the shoulder and pulled her inside . The slam of the door was followed by the start of a rant . <p> " You look like a savage ! Your father must be rolling in his grave ! To think of all the care and love we 've both lavished on you . But you do n't appreciate anything , do you ? I 've never seen a more ungrateful child ! Well , this is the last straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Who is Aunt Gladys ? " asked Caterpillar . <p> " She 's my mother 's sister , a real bitch . She lives way out in the country . I 'll probably be locked , in my bedroom there for a week . But they 'll probably try to shave my ' hair ' off first . " <p> Erin 's second scalp crawled in revulsion . " This can not be ! " <p> Anne Merkin was dialing the phone . " Quit your mumbling , young lady ! " <p> A long extrusion of Anne 's new hair shot out and wrapped itself around Anne Merkin 's neck . <p> " Urk ! " <p> " Do n't choke her , Caterpillar ! You 'll kill her ! " <p> Like a stack of poker chips flicked with a finger , Anne Merkin dropped unconscious to the linoleum at the same time that Caterpillar replied . " I merely needed to discommode her long enough to gain control of her sleep centers . Circuits are locked in a feedback loop now , and she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Erin 's hair reeled itself in . The dangling phone played a message of operator annoyance , and Erin absentmindedly recradled it . She moved to her mother 's side , arranging her limbs more naturally . Fetching a pillow and afghan from the parlor , she made the sleeper as comfortable as possible . Caterpillar did not interfere until she was finished . <p> " Very well . Now we must get to work . " <p> 7 . Jumping Someone Else 's Train The time was now after midnight . Quiet as the interval between tracks on a CD , the neighborhood  --  including of course Anne Merkin  --  slept peacefully , unaware of the coming planetary doom being birthed beneath Erin 's fingers . <p> Erin 's hands had apparently developed skills and a mind of their own . She found herself watching in bemusement as they began to do the kind of things that gearhead boys liked to do with cars . With several tools no more complex than a kitchen knife , a pair of tweezers , a Gameboy and , ironically , a handheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange mechanism . <p> First she watched her familiar digits , each chewed nail enameled in flaking Ghetto Grit , deconstruct the Merkins ' television , radio , VCR , microwave and Waterpik into a junkheap of parts spread across the parlor floor . Then she marveled as Caterpillar , using her personal limbs like waldoes , began to put the components together according to distinctly non-human rules . Erin had never imagined that the nozzle of a Waterpik might possibly funnel microwaves , but such seemed to be Caterpillar 's intent . <p> After the first hour of this painstaking work , Erin began to grow bored and uncomfortable . <p> " Hey , Caterpiggle ! Ca n't I change the way I 'm sitting ? My legs feel like they 're gon na fall off ! " <p> " Sorry . Allow me to reconfigure your badly engineered circulatory channels and remove all discomfort . " <p> Without shifting position , Erin suddenly felt wonderful . " Gee , thanks ! " This attention to her commandeered body raised a parallel question in her mind . " How come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you flopping around like a fish out of water ? " <p> " My race is basically anaerobic . Our metabolisms can get by without oxygen , although we can toggle into several other modes as well . I must admit , though , that the dryness of your atmosphere is distressing to me . " <p> " Are you asking me to go soak my head ? " <p> " Later , perhaps . Now the work must continue . " <p> Half a dismal hour passed . Erin found herself pondering another puzzling question . " Do you guys have machines and stuff like this on Europa ? I did n't see any in your home movies . " <p> " No , we are a non-technological culture , employing direct mental control of universal forces . You see , the cosmic roiling in the spacetime continuum created by the electromagnetic-gravitic plasma-dance amongst Jupiter and its satellites allows us to access certain energies directly . We evolved naturally to manipulate forces which you lower orders have little conception of . Here on your cold planet , however , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your memories . " <p> " What are you talking about ? I do n't know any of this electronics shit . " <p> " So you believe . " <p> Erin was left to ponder the implications of this statement while Caterpillar continued his work . Eventually , she found herself dozing off in a natural manner , despite her busy eyes remaining wide open in order to continue guiding her darting hands . <p> When she regained awareness , several hours had slipped by . Her hands were cradling the Gameboy , which was cabled to the softly glowing asymmetrical mess of jiggered parts . The screen of the video game displayed a welter of scrolling alien icons . <p> " I need several more components not available in your domicile . We shall have to visit a military base . " <p> This bland statement was the most insane thing Erin had heard since the Caterpillar had attached itself to her , and its absurdity set her off . <p> " Are you absolutely bugshit ? I 'd be shot on sight ! " <p> Caterpillar remained unperturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of my investigations of your mentality , I have discovered certain latent untapped potentials in your brain which will make our task fairly straightforward . It seems that your race , in partial compensation for your unfortunate choice of birthplaces , has evolved so as to be able to take advantage spontaneously and irregularly of certain loopholes among the physical laws . Nonlocal actions , extratemporal sensing and other seemingly freakish abilities not available to more sophisticated beings like me are open to your race . I simply propose to put these talents under my direct and precise control . " <p> " I still do n't see what all this guff means for me . " <p> " Only this . Please concentrate on the nearest military base you know of . " <p> Obligingly , Erin summoned up a picture of Fort Vandermeer , where her dad had once done his National Guard duty . She pictured the main parade grounds where she had once strolled , hand in hand with her father . <p> Pre-dawn illumination tinged the frosty sky above the barracks . Gravel crunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only figure in sight was a guard at the gate facing quite rationally outward , toward potential invaders . In the chilly silence , Erin distinctly heard the guard cough twice . <p> " Holy  --  " <p> Caterpillar cut her off . " Quiet ! Now , I would a judge that windowless structure a warehouse  --  " <p> The interior of the barnlike shed was quite dark . But suddenly Erin found that she could see , if only in black and white . <p> Caterpillar directed the girl up and down a number of aisles . Soon , her arms were loaded with hardware . <p> The next second she stood again in her parlor . Gratefully , she dumped her burdens to the floor . <p> Picking up a GPS unit with Erin 's hands , Caterpillar said , " The fastenings on this unit are non-standard . Let us visit a hardware store . " <p> Having done so well with her first jump , the prospect of teleporting a second time seemed more agreeable to Erin . " Could we maybe stop for some food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ! " <p> Erin paid close attention to what Caterpillar did next with her mind . <p> 8 . The Lovecats Fueled by a dozen Kit Kat bars liberated from the locked but hardly **26;2140;TOOLONG grocery store , Erin labored long hours under Caterpillar 's behest . As the morning progressed , sunlight gradually flooding the parlor and revealing all the weirdness with a level of detail that the night had half-concealed , Erin could feel herself growing sweatier and grosser by the minute . The Caterpillar 's unceasing construction of its looming Doomsday Device required Erin to be in constant motion : climbing up and down chairs , crawling under projecting shelves of circuits , bending into odd-shaped cavities . Combined with the jog home from the beach , this activity left her grottier than young Patti Smith 's armpits . Adolescent musk rose off her in powerful waves . Almost as strong as the desire to get clean was the craving for a bidi . <p> " Caterpillar , I need a break ! " <p> " Are you experiencing any aches ? " <p> Erin inventoried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No . But I have to take a shower before I make myself faint ! " <p> " I too would like to immerse myself in the second-rate yet potentially refreshing waters of your world . But its conversion to Europan parameters must be initiated first . My whole race is depending on me . " <p> " Yeah , well , I never signed up for this little chore . " <p> " Did you not extend the gullible hand of interplanetary friendship to me on the beach and invite me onboard ? " <p> Erin paused . " Well , maybe I kinda did .... But that was before I knew about your evil plans ! " <p> " What do you care about the fate of your globe ? Do not attempt to persuade me of your nonexistent charity toward all mankind . Recall that I have access to your memories . You often wished the world would explode and end your so-called ' suffering . ' " <p> " I  --  I was just being melodramatic ! I did n't mean anybody any real harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Like during the Gulf War when I was little , and all anyone could talk about was killing an Arab ! " <p> " Nonetheless , you should be glad that the pitiful charade of human existence is about to be transmogrified . " <p> Erin tried to teleport out of her house to the police station , but nothing happened . Apparently , the function remained under Caterpillar 's control . Instead , she found herself stepping will-lessly back from the alien machine . The Gameboy was still cabled to the bigger contraption , and now Erin 's fingers danced across the controls , causing a parade of portentous icons to march across the display . <p> " Now the door to the Funhouse is open . " <p> A liquid platinum lambency filled one irregular cavity of the machine , and the next second something popped out . <p> The creature that emerged resembled ball lightning or a swamp-gas will-o-the-wisp , a sparky , fuzzy roil of energy  --  except that it appeared to possess infinite depths filled with churning hazy images . Erin thought she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then surface again , time after time . Erin sensed a kind of playful curiosity , a joy and elan radiate from the vital creature . As if reciprocating her attention , the being began to " purr " on some subliminal yet detectable level . <p> " What  --  what is it ? " <p> " This is an intelligent creature composed entirely of what your scientists have just recently begun to call ' funny energy . ' It originates out of the very substrate of the universe , from below the Planck level . We have often employed them usefully as assistants , for they are able to manipulate matter directly at the quantum level . " <p> Suddenly a second creature  --  Erin found herself thinking of them as " Lovecats "  --  blipped into the parlor . This Lovecat did not linger with the original , but shot off , straight through the house 's walls without damaging them ! <p> Now a steady stream of Lovecats began to emerge , all darting off in different directions . Only the first , the Master Lovecat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay between the machine and his flock , " Caterpillar said . <p> " What are they going to do ? " <p> " I have set them multiple tasks . First they are going to increase the albedo  --  the reflectivity  --  of your polar ice caps . This will start the chilling of your globe , as more and more solar radiance is returned to space . Then the Lovecats , as you name them , will attend to other changes involving carbon-sequestering and such . Your damaged climate is already balanced on a needle , and only needs a slight push to plunge into the deepest Ice Age ever seen . In only a few years , your globe will be entirely frozen , a new Europa suitable for colonization by my kind . I estimate that your civilization will take approximately six months to collapse . As I earlier suggested , however , a few humans might make the transition to the new world , if they adopt the habits and capabilities of certain marine mammals . " <p> Now Erin felt so awful about what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene or addict 's clove-cravings paled in comparison . <p> 9 . Wild Mood Swings Throughout the long morning and into the afternoon , an endless procession of bristly , crackling , weightless Lovecats emerged from the Doomsday Machine . All Erin could do was watch in muted horror as the agents of Earth 's freezeout zipped off to fulfill the Caterpillar 's wicked commands . The alien seemed not to care about rest or sustenance or comfort , for either himself or his mount , but instead remained focused on the smooth workings of his gateway to the basement boiler-room of the cosmos , the Funhouse . <p> Erin 's mind raced in tight circles . How could she escape ? How could she save her planet ? Would the new Ice Age possibly spare an England sustained in warmth by the Gulf Stream , and thus leave habitable the home of the adorable Robert Smith , the clone of whose hair she now sported ? And finally , what was this looming planetary catastrophe going to do to her virginal love life ? <p> Around three in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not respond , " warned the Caterpillar . <p> " Erin , hello ! It 's me , Elise ! Why were n't you at school today ? " <p> " She 's got a key , " Erin told Caterpillar . But this intelligence came too late to save her friend . <p> The door swung open directly onto the parlor . Elise stepped inside , spotted Erin , and exclaimed , " Wow , look at your hair ! " before promptly vanishing . <p> Ten seconds later came an identical knocking on the door , which had mysteriously closed itself . <p> " Erin , hello ! It 's me , Elise ! Why were n't you at school today ? " <p> Elise entered the house , spoke her ultimate line  --  " Wow , look at your hair ! "  --  and disappeared again . Ten more seconds ticked by , and the entire scenario replayed once more . <p> " What have you done to Elise , you monster ! " <p> " I have rolled up her entire existence into this short sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is like a hoop rolling through a landscape of time , surfacing at regular intervals forever . " <p> " Erin , hello ! It 's me , Elise ! Why were n't you at school today ? Wow , look at your hair ! " " Erin , hello ! It 's me , Elise ! Why were n't you at school today ? Wow , look at your hair ! " " Erin  --  ! " <p> " Oh , this is awful ! You have to set her free ! Look , the neighbors will soon spot something wrong and call the cops . " <p> " No , they will not . They will think you girls are simply playing around , as foolish young females frequently do . In any case , the changes engineered by the Lovecats will become irreversible within the next few hours . In fact , so confident of my success am I , that I believe I will now take advantage of your offer to soak your head . " <p> Caterpillar marched Erin past her sleeping mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bathroom . There , the alien compelled her to strip . Beneath Erin 's black garb she wore a lace-trimmed camisole and white cotton panties , the latter garment bearing the image of Badtz-Maru , the enigmatic penguin friend of Hello Kitty . Seen by Erin in the mirror , the gloomy bird seemed to proclaim , Finally , Earth will become a world fit for penguins ! <p> Completely naked the next minute , Erin was forced to contemplate herself in the full-length mirror , a task she generally avoided . Oh , God , why could n't she be built like Xena ? Maybe then she 'd be able to save the world .... <p> Caterpillar disdained to close the shower curtain before setting only the cold water gushing from the lower tap . The twist of a valve set the frigid spray pouring out the showernozzle and directly onto her head . For a brief moment , Erin felt encased in ice . Then she experienced the bitterly cold flow as pure pleasure . <p> " Ah , if only there were more sulphur in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Erin decided to make the best of this experience and get clean . On a hanging wire rack stood several plastic bottles : shampoo , creme rinse , pre-rinse , after-rinse , and half-a-dozen other hair condiments . Although Erin had hated her old locks , she had taken scrupulous care of them . No sense being grotty just to spite her Mom . Now she reached instinctively for a bottle , but found her hand halted . <p> " What are those ? " <p> " Just soaps . " <p> " Ah , cleansing agents . We do not have these on Europa . Very well . Proceed . " <p> Erin squirted her alien hair full of pearly aromatic liquid and began to work it in . <p> A strange feeling of disorientation passed through her . Then Caterpillar began to chant . <p> " Oh , the bliss ! Oh , the joy ! Sweet heavenly scents ! Marvelous compounds ! My veins thrill with ambrosia ! More , more , more ! " <p> Like a crazed beautician , Erin dosed Caterpillar with six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gibberish . <p> Experimentally , Erin reached out and turned off the water . Nothing stopped her . She stepped freely from the tub . Caterpillar continued to moan and croon . Erin grabbed a spraycan of mousse and covered Caterpillar with it , sealing the intoxicating chemicals beneath a layer of stiffening goo , much as Caterpillar had wanted to cordon off the earth . <p> Regarding herself in the mirror , Erin saw , on one level of perception , a teenaged living mess : skin blue and goosepimpled , hair crusted over . <p> But on another level , Xena herself looked back . <p> In his delirium , Caterpillar had plundered her memories and emerged with a snatch of a Cure song . Now the alien sang over and over in its androgynous contralto a snatch of Smithian lyrics : <p> " Show me , show me , show me how you do that trick ! The one that makes me scream , ' She 's sick ! ' And I promise you , I promise that I 'll run away with you ! " <p> Erin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Badass Sea Slug . I 'll show you a trick or two ! " <p> 10 . Gone ! The Master Lovecat was n't a bad guy at all once you got to know him . Frisky and curious , amorally cooperative , the energy creature summoned from the warp and weft of the plenum wanted nothing more than to please anyone who exhibited a token friendship by inviting Lovecats up the scales of the multiverse into the macroverse . <p> It had taken Erin more than an hour to establish efficient communications with Lovecat Number One . ( She still was n't sure whether the scattered horde of beings shared one identity or many . ) She certainly was n't aided by the background roar of raving nonsense the Caterpillar kept chattering into her auditory nerves . Strange physical sensations  --  itches , bad tastes , dizziness  --  plagued her as well . But by mentally tweaking her newly talented brain ( Erin pictured the operation as adjusting slider controls on a boombox ) , she managed to lower the buzz and random stimuli from the alien , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she figured , since she had to keep monitoring the Europan to make sure of its intoxication levels . <p> By sheer persistence , Erin had eventually broken through the language barrier to send and receive information to and from the Master Lovecat . Not that language was precisely the word . Unlike Caterpillar , the Lovecat seemed to communicate by pictures and feelings and gestaltic lumps . Talking to it was more like trying to manage a directed dream . But after many frustrating minutes , during which Erin counseled herself not to freak because like all of Earth was counting on her , she finally felt that the two of them understood each other . <p> So , taking a deep breath , Erin ordered the Master Lovecat to reverse the climatological changes initiated by the Caterpillar . <p> Done , she thought she heard/felt/remembered . <p> Erin expelled a gust of held air . " Whew ! " <p> " Erin , hello ! It 's me , Elise ! Why were n't you at school today ? Wow , look at your hair ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why were n't you at school today ? Wow , look at your hair ! " " Erin  --  " <p> Continually cycling through time , popping in and out of Erin 's perceptions like a skipping film , Elise had been an annoying subliminal midge-drone while Erin concentrated on saving mankind 's ungrateful , ignorant but irreplaceable ass . Now , however , Erin felt she could spare a moment to rescue her friend . <p> Digging mental fingers into an unnatural n-dimensional knot she sensed around the front door , Erin untied Elise 's contorted lifeline . <p> " Erin ! Where are your clothes ! " <p> Clothes ? Who could bother with clothes now ? Did Xena stop fighting if she busted a bra-strap ? <p> " I 'll explain later . " Erin suddenly considered the plight of the third human in the room . She teleported over to her mother , touched her shoulder , probed inside , and woke Anne Merkin up . <p> Mrs. Merkin gazed up at the ceiling . Her brain seemed to be lagging behind her eyes . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk now ! I 've got to fix my hair 's little red wagon so we 're never bothered by it again ! " <p> Erin transmitted the concept of a soft warm blanket to the Master Lovett , who was busy reabsorbing all his scattered task-finished minions back into himself . <p> Protect me , she pleaded . <p> She stepped sidewise across 480 million miles of space . <p> 11 . Hot Hot Hot ! ! ! Jupiter 's glow reflected colorfully from Erin 's nose jewelry , like Christmas lights in a silver ornament . Cocooned in a glowing transparent nimbus , the Master Lovecat hovering at her shoulder , the nude girl regarded Europa , the snowball home of the aggressive Caterpillars . <p> Atop her head , the mousse-encapsulated , balsam-besotted alien seemed laboriously to take cognizance of its altered surroundings . <p> " Where  --  are  --  we ? Home ? How  --  ? " <p> " Shut up ! I 'm going to make sure you guys never mess with my world again ! " <p> " No ! What  --  what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! " <p> Erin felt the Caterpillar strive to regain control of her mind . But she was too strong for it now , at least in its attenuated state . The alien was reduced to pleading . <p> " Please ! Visit my world ! You 'll see then . We do n't deserve whatever doom you intend ! " <p> " All right ! But no funny stuff ! " <p> Erin reappeared under miles of Europan ice . Her eyes adjusted themselves to the level of illumination . Here in reality was the watery world she had seen from Caterpillar 's mental filmstrip . <p> Within minutes , she was surrounded by many of Caterpillar 's peers all mounted on their various steeds . They could not speak to her directly , but she sensed their unease and abject surrender . They were more pathetic than a bunch of middle-schoolers . <p> " Oh , damn ! What a bunch of lameoids ! All right , you 've convinced me ! Here , you can join your friends ! " <p> Erin psychically transported Caterpillar off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her protective force-shell and into the welcoming sea . The water dissolved the hallucinatory rinses and shampoos off Caterpillar , and through some fading quantum thread of connection she heard the alien 's familiar nasty voice exclaim , " We 'll be back ! And when you do n't have the Lovecats with you  --  ! " <p> Erin smiled . " Right . " Then she popped out into space again , close to Europa , where , with a little generous help from the Lovecats , she pushed the satellite out of its orbit , just as effortlessly as her father had once impelled her on a swing . <p> The titanic splash the moon made in Jupiter 's atmosphere , photographed by a startled but quick-thinking astronomer at the controls of the Hubble telescope , was destined to become the best-selling poster of the next five decades . <p> 12 . Just Like Heaven Erin 's chestnut-colored hair hung long and lush to the shoulders of her new black leather jacket . At eight P.M. on a beautiful summer 's Friday night , she stood in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two girls could barely control themselves . Puffing on bidis , bouncing with anticipation , breaking into spontaneous broad smiles , they advanced slowly with the other ticket-holders . To pass the time , they debated possible set-lists . <p> " ' Friday I 'm in Love ' ! " <p> " ' Mint Car ' ! " <p> " ' Wendy Time ' ! " <p> " ' Pictures of You ' ! " <p> " ' Close to Me ' ! " <p> Once inside the auditorium , they rushed to their reserved front-row-center seats . Even the grungy techies moving equipment around on the impossibly close stage looked to their eyes like the glamorous priests of an exotic cult . <p> " Oh , Erin ! It 's like a dream come true ! Remember this winter , when you were feeling so down and you like went mental and destroyed all your appliances and ripped out your hair and started sleep-walking around naked until you snapped out of it ? Who would 've ever guessed that a few months later we 'd be sitting right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're stuck , something will come along to unstick you ! " <p> " You are so right , Elise ! " <p> The lights went down , and the opening act came on . Elise whispered , " Do you think we 'll get to go onstage ? That would be the ultimate ! " <p> " I ca n't say , " Erin replied , and she really could n't . <p> She had pulled a lot of tricks to get the Cure here and secure these tickets . Teleporting into the record company 's offices and jiggering their computers had been the easiest part of it . But for the moment she was finished with trickery . <p> If she did get called up tonight to stand onstage in front of thousands of admiring eyes with her favorite band in the world , it was going to be strictly because of who she was ! <p> <p> By Paul Di Filippo <p> Paul Di Filippo , prolific denizen of Providence , is the author of such books as Lost Pages , Joe 's Liver , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous stories " Stink Lines " and " Fractal Paisleys " in its pop-culture leanings . This one owes its origins to that British band called The Cure . It also owes its origins , Paul notes , to his meeting Erin Kennedy ( daughter of Silver Web editor Ann Kennedy ) and discovering her fondness for the band . Curiously , Mr. Di Filippo denies that he wrote this one off the top of his head . <p>
