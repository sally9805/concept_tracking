Section : WHO 'S NEXT RICK SANTORUM : The No. 3 man in the Senate leadership is hard at work spreading the GOP gospel . Will his crusades take him all the way to the White House ? <p> For most denizens of Washington , politics is a living , perhaps a way of life . For Rick Santorum , it is a bruising crusade . As a student in the dissolute 1970s , he smoked his share of pot at Penn State and was , by his own account , somewhat casual about his Roman Catholic faith . Now , still boyish at 46 , he is a devout and devoted family man  --  father to six home-schooled children  --  and a senator determined to champion the church 's traditional moral principles in the public square . In the reception area of his office , there 's a predictably appropriate portrait of Pennsylvania 's Ben Franklin , bibulous deist . But the one on the wall in the sanctum of Santorum is of Thomas More , sainted for losing his life in defense of Rome 's control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reason , " Santorum said in an interview . " There was a guy who was willing to stand up for things that were not particularly popular , and he paid the price for it . " <p> Thus far , however , Santorum 's story is the opposite of More 's : professions of belief have been his ticket to the top . He 's become one of the shrewdest players in the front ranks of the faith-based Republican Party George W. Bush and Karl Rove have erected . As the third-ranking Republican in a majority soon to expand to 55 members , Santorum is close to the White House , operates one of the largest personal campaign funds and is a point man on hot-button issues ranging from gay marriage to Social Security . Used to being the youngest or the first , Santorum won a seat in the U.S. House at 32 ( with hundreds of anti-abortion activists serving as his shock troops ) and one in the Senate at 36 . His combatively devout approach is one Republicans are hoping will expand their control in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lakes states and Hispanic voters everywhere . It 's an approach Santorum has told friends he thinks can propel him to the presidency someday . <p> Perhaps , but it may not be easy to persuade the GOP , let alone the country , to accept the full Santorum canon . Evolution , he says , should be taught in public schools , but only as a still-controversial scientific theory that " has holes . " There is no constitutionally based right to privacy , he says , arguing that it is a phony legal concoction foisted on the country by liberal judges . As it happens , the 1965 case which declared the existence of privacy rights legitimized contraception . He calls that case , and others that followed it , a " massive usurpation of power by the judiciary . " " Would I ban contraception in the states as a state legislator ? No way . Would I do it as a federal official ? No way . " Even so , he said , each state should be free to legislate the matter on its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably , adultery or premarital sex ) , then so be it . " It should be the same with sodomy laws , " he said . " Texas should have had the right . People should have had the right . " <p> Santorum 's high regard for states ' rights does n't extend to the question of who can marry legally . He favors a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman . A " nonuniform definition of marriage " would cause too much " disruption in the culture , " Santorum said . When Utah was admitted to the Union , he said , " they had to give up polygamy . So we all understood then that marriage and family were such core institutions of this country that having different laws in different states would disassemble the family . And when it came to something as foundational as that , we could not have dissension . " <p> Santorum frightens the big shots , then becomes one . Arriving in the House , Santorum joined a crusade to shutter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of soon-to-be-Speaker Newt Gingrich . New in the Senate , Santorum demanded punishment for a senior Republican who had blockaded a GOP-sponsored balanced-budget amendment . The accused survived ; his accuser was tapped for leadership . <p> But Santorum has taken incoming of his own . He 's been stung by criticism from early supporters who view him as an apostate for helping to save the Judiciary Committee chairmanship for his Pennsylvania colleague , moderate ( i.e. , pro-choice ) Arlen Specter . Some of the denunciations have been vituperative . " That comes with the territory , and I 'm not upset with anybody , " said Santorum , who in fact sounded upset , and who is not known for thick skin . <p> Santorum had better get used to it . Attacks  --  from right and left  --  are sure to rise as he juggles the sometimes clashing roles of Senate power broker and cultural militant . " Rick is going to have to help make sausage like the rest of us , " said a fellow Republican senator . " That is going to mean sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't do that too often or he 'll lose what is distinctive about his political persona . His relevant role model may not be an English saint but an American from Missouri . " If you ca n't stand the heat , " said President Harry Truman , " get out of the kitchen . " <p> Do n't expect Santorum to do so : he 's a heat-seeking missile . Word in New York is that he 's already put out feelers to a major GOP donor about a possible presidential bid . Some close friends advise him to take his time , but that 's never been Santorum 's style . If he wins what could be a tough re-election campaign  --  perhaps against Pennsylvania 's Democratic governor , Ed Rendell , or Bob Casey Jr. , the pro-life state treasurer  --  Santorum may head straight for the hottest place of all : a race for the Republican nomination . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BULLY PULPIT : The senator displays a portrait of Roman Catholic martyr Thomas More in his office <p> PHOTO ( COLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smoked pot in the ' 70s and was a somewhat casual Catholic  --  is now in the front ranks of the new faith-based GOP <p> By Howard Fineman <p>
