To the list of profound post-Sept. 11 changes that fizzled  --  bipartisanship , the death of irony  --  add the great sobering of cable news . Before the attacks , five-year-old Fox News was gaining on established rival CNN with an in-your-face , chatter-heavy lineup . CNN ( like TIME , an AOL Time Warner property ) , which had long subscribed to the motto The News Is the Star , was shaking up its management and hiring star talent like anchor Paula Zahn  --  swiped from Fox amid much acrimony  --  to snazz up its often staid image . But the war made viewers want news , not shouting  --  old CNN-style news , with in-depth reports from far-flung correspondents . <P> Then normality broke out . By January , with the smoke clearing in Afghanistan , cable news was back to hockey-rage trials , Mike Tyson-biting scandals and the Sept. 10-era question , How do you grab viewers on slow news days ? Fox , it turned out , had the most successful answer . Last month , for the first time , the network outdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million fewer homes . On the whole , its viewership was up 109% over the year ( CNN countered that because its own audience grew 51% over the same period , Fox 's gains did not come at its expense ) , while MSNBC lagged both considerably . <P> Detractors say Fox owes its success to conservative viewers drawn by rightist-skewed news . Fox says it simply provides a " fair and balanced " alternative to liberal-media bias . Either way , it would be naive not to see that the channel , home to a raft of conservative personalities like Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly , is a comfortable home for right-of-center viewers . But while it is tempting to see Fox 's success in red America-vs. - blue America terms ( i.e. , Bush regions vs . Gore regions ) , there is as much a cultural as a political divide , manifest as much in Fox 's look as in its talk . Watching Fox News is like sitting inside a very patriotic video game . Thundering martial drums play over a Jan. 28 George W. Bush speech as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then zooms at you with the swoosh ! of an attack jet . This is not news packaged to impress blue-America TV critics ; it 's NASCAR with Pentagon briefings . Call it crass or pandering  --  if you get your news from Jim Lehrer , you probably call it both  --  but it says , viscerally , that the news is worth getting passionate about . And perhaps because of its love of a good fight , Fox seems to book further-left debate foils  --  for instance , Larry Holmes of Act Now to Stop War and End Racism , one of several World Economic Forum protesters appearing last week . ( It also hired CNN host Greta Van Susteren , though her defense-attorney background may put off law-and-order conservatives . ) <P> Fox News has done with general news what CNBC did with business news  --  treated it as ESPN treats sports , with conflict , a little jocularity , NFL-style graphics and rooting interests . Traditional , detached TV news tells you the news is interesting . Fox News tells you the news rocks . Thus the clubhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frat-house yuks of morning show Fox &; Friends to the anchors who , after learning of Fox 's ratings win , taunted CNN with the glee of a point guard who just sank a three .
