I dream of her still . It 's been years since I 've seen her , my oldest friend and truest enemy , but she drifts through my sleep almost nightly . Though her face is usually hidden , my heart recognizes her . " Sookie , " I call out , voiceless as if underwater . She turns and all I can see are her teeth gleaming white in the blackness . Her mouth stretches wide , smiling , as if she is happy to see me . But even in my dream , it does n't seem right , her joy does n't fit . And then I notice how pointy her teeth are , how they are fangs , really , and how through the slightly open mouth , they are glistening , as if about to take a bite . When I wake , I try to envision her face , but her features melt into one another ; I see a smudge of black hair , dark eyes , a smear of mouth as if through churning waves . Or as if through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fought Lobetto in the ditch behind her apartment ; at fourteen , peeking out from under the paper bag she had put on her head when we went to Dr. Pak 's VD clinic ; at seventeen when , with her mother 's makeup smeared over her face , she taught me about " honeymooning " in the backbooths of the GI clubs ; at twenty when she pushed a wet and wailing Myu Myu into my arms and told me , " She 's your daughter now . " In every memory I have of her , I can hear her words , see her gestures , but her face remains a fragmented blur . I 've written to her-postcards , a line or two on the back of photos of Myu Myu , who wants to be called Maya now . I indulge the child to make up for the beginning of her life , watching her carefully for signs of developmental delays , erratic behavior , eccentricities that could be blamed on me . I am the only mother Maya knows , but for me , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters are my guilt payment , I suppose , and one day I will send them , these years ' worth of notes , to her , care of Club Foxa Hawai'i . One day , when it is safe , I would like to see Sookie again , once more , face-to-face , so that I can reconcile her in my memory and banish her from my dreams . Maybe after enough time has passed , I could see her clearly , without money or love or other people 's vision clouding my eyes . When we were children , everyone in Chollak thought Sookie was ugly ; this is what I loved most about her . Her ugliness-bulbous eyed and dark skinned-was greater than mine and shielded me to some degree . " Gundong-hi , ssang-dong-i , " the neighborhood boys teased as we walked the path from school . " The Butt Twins , " they called us . Sookie covered her ears-bony elbows sticking out like a kite-and I tucked the stained side of my face into my shoulder . Reasoning that they could n't call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned my good side toward the taunting and let the teasing fall on my friend . " Blackie , black dog , " they shouted at her . Sookie , hands still over her ears , would recite the alphabet . " Your father must be a U.S. darkie ! " the boys spat at us . Even Lobetto , whose father was a black GI and whose skin was darker than Sookie 's , teased her since at least he had a father . " Eh , chokka ! " I screamed , stooping to pick up a broken piece of concrete from the sidewalk . " I 'm gon na kick your penis ! " Young Sik and Chung Woo swiveled their hips and " oooh-ooohed " us . Lobetto yelled back , " I doubt you 'd even know where to find it , you pile-of-shit-face ! What did your mama do to make you born so ugly ? Eh . Hyung Jin ? " He pronounced the first part of my name with a hard " g " at the end , changing its meaning from wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure Korean , not like you , half-half . " I jutted out my hip and shook the chunk of concrete at him . Back then , I was the bolder one , secure in my family 's station , our relative wealth . I thought we were rich because we never had to worry about rice and once a week we ate meat . Chicken , pork , even beef sometimes . My mother 's family , who had lived in Chollak generations before the start of World War II , owned the sweet shop we worked and lived in . We had an actual house-two rooms with an inside kitchen-not like the piramin shacks that the northerners or the GI girls from America Town lived in . Not like the dump Sookie and her mother had lived in before they found an " uncle " from the base . " You are pure Korean , hah , Sookie ? " I asked under my breath , testing the heft of stone in my palm . I was pretty sure if she was n't , I would have been forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to play with Lobetto and Chosopine , before her father had taken her but not her mother to America . " Ka na da ra ! " Sookie continued to sing the alphabet , still holding her hands over her ears . I could see the muscles in her thin arms quivering . " Hana , dul , set , " I growled , and on " three " I whirled and let the concrete fly . Since I never bothered to aim , but threw blindly at the group of boys , I did n't think I 'd hit anyone . That day , though , I hit Lobetto in the face , opening a gash across his forehead . " Aaah , good luck ! " I cried as I grabbed Sookie 's arm to run . " No , bad luck ! " Sookie gasped as the boys , leaving a dazed Lobetto sitting in the middle of the street , swarmed after us . " If Lobetto tells his daddy , my mother will have a hard time getting on the base . Then I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow winding alleys toward America Town , jumping over piles of chili peppers laid out on mats to dry , dodging an old halmoni who carried her colicky grandson on her bent back . " Excuse me , Tong Su 's Grandma , " I called over my shoulder before she began yelling about ill-mannered children racing through the streets like criminals . With luck , the boys would crash into the grandmother and be taken inside to be punished with a lecture and some ear pulling . We bolted into my father 's store before Lobetto and his gang turned the corner . Since our store sat just outside the entrance to America Town , near the point where the GIs divided the streets into white section and black section , we had both pale miguks and dark gomshis stop in to check our merchandise . But our best customers were the kids who liked to come by after school to look at the Juicy Fruit or Coca-Cola , then buy yot or wax lips for something sweet . Only the Americans and their whores could afford the miguk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white refrigerator especially for the Coca-Cola . When the miguk gave it to us , we tried to put it inside the store , but once it was in , we could n't open the door and there was no place to put the table of candy . Now the refrigerator sits in front and people call our store Coka , even when all we have in the cooler is kimchee . The one time the American who installed the cooler came for a maintenance check , he asked my father , " Where Coca-Cola ? This only Coca-Cola . " He held his fist to his mouth and glug-glugged smacking his lips . My father pretended not to understand his Korean , pointed to two dusty bottles of Coke we kept on the counter for display , and said , " Three thousand won . " Years later , I understood that the Coca-Cola refrigerator came through Sookie 's mother , a gift because of my friendship with Sookie , and because of the promises her mother and my father had made to one another before we were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I burst through the door and scuttled under the candy table . I tugged the tablecloth down a few inches , trying to create a shield without tumbling the trays of sweets off the counter . Pulled as far as I dared , the cloth barely covered my face . I scooted toward the shadows against the wall . Sookie squeezed her shoulders between the legs of the stool ; with her arms splayed out in front of her and her dark hair hanging in front of her panting face , I thought Lobetto was right : she did look like a black dog . My father came through the beaded curtain which separated the store from our living space . " What , did I hear my daughter 's voice ? " he teased , talking to the air above us , pretending not to see us . " Or was that a ghost ? A faceless fox spirit that will steal my heart when I sleep ? " " Shh , Daddy , " I scolded . " We are hiding from the boys . " Appah laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girls . At least let me see what they want . " My father strode to the door . When he flung it open , he caught the boys huddled in front , debating whether or not to hunt us in our own territory . " Sirs , come in . Come in . " The boys shuffled in , bare feet tracking in the dust from the streets . " Would you gentlemen like a piece of yot ? Some juice ? Mother of Hyun Jin made some fresh plum juice this morning . " My father talked to them formally , as if they were paying customers . Sookie pinched me . " Tell your daddy to throw them out . Tell your daddy to scold them for teasing us . Tell your daddy they called us the Butt Twins , " she hissed . I bit my lip , hating that my father acted so kind to them , yet reluctant to remind him of my ugliness . Wavering , I did nothing . The boys circled the candy table , kicking under the hem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones and heard a yelp . Ducking my head to peek out , I saw Young Sik hopping on one foot . I stuck out my tongue at him . " You decide what you want ? " my father asked , stepping in front of the table . I scrambled back , shuffling around his legs for another viewpoint . Pressing my face against the floor , I could crane my head enough to see up the nose of the closest boy . " Three wax lips , " Lobetto grumbled and swatted at a fly circling lazily around the cut above his eye ; the blood had gelled so that it was almost the same color and consistency as the cherry-flavored wax lips . Lobetto was the only one with money and had to buy something with my father waiting on him . Swaggering past my father , he thunked his won onto the counter . Startled , I flinched and pressed closer to Sookie . Above Sookie 's breath in my ear , I could hear the boys slurping the juice inside the wax . Imagining them grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teeth , I rolled my eyes at Sookie . She giggled . " So , boys . " My father clapped his hands over her laughter . " Which one of you has come to propose a match with my daughter ? " One of them choked , spitting his lips onto the floor . The boys stammered , stepping on each other 's feet , their bodies bumping together . Lobetto kicked at Young Sik who kicked Chung Woo . Chung Woo bent down to pick up his candy , shooting a look under the table where we crouched . He lifted his real lips toward his nose , like a snarling dog , and narrowed his eyes . Then , slipping the wax lips into his mouth , he flashed us a candied grin before standing . After the boys left , Appah pulled us out from under the table . " My girl is so popular , the boys follow her home from school . " He was joking , but still I preened , thrusting my bony chest out and holding my head high , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not consider me deformed . While my mother often poked at me to straighten my spine , to braid my hair , to stop looking so cross-eyed-which was difficult since I was also told to cock my head to hide the birthmark-my father pampered me with treats and stories . He told me tales of bears turning into women fit to marry the king of heaven , of beautiful princesses trapped for three hundred years in the form of centipedes , of girls haunting the earth as nine-tailed foxes . Always , they were stories of transformation , of ugliness turning into beauty . Sometimes as he talked , I thought he looked at my birthmark with remorse , but when I would turn sharply to confront him , his eyes were filled not with guilt or shame but with bright laughter . Despite what I looked like , I was still his only child ; I worked hard to be perfect in other ways . " I am still Class Leader , " I said , lifting my head . " I 'm number one , Sookie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she minded my boasting , but she smiled big enough to show her teeth . I always tried to be number one in school , the leader of the class-the one who led the line to the yard , the one who could call on rivals when I knew they would give a wrong answer . When Esteemed Teacher called on the rows to recite the countries and capitals of the world , I made sure my voice was loudest , unfaltering . During tests when the teacher knew I knew all the answers , I was chosen to patrol the rest of the children . If they looked numb with chanting , I 'd slap them on the head to wake them up . If they mumbled wrong answers , I 'd mark down their names . I stood with my ear against their faces to make sure they were not just mouthing the words . I 'd point at the map of the world taped on the front wall and , cunning as a fox , cull out by instinct the most vulnerable : " Lobetto , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the prime minister of Canada ? Speak up ! " " Young Sik , who are the Republic of Korea 's giant allies ? If you do not answer by the count of three , I will make you stand in the corner to answer harder and harder questions ! " By the time we graduated from primary school , Sookie was my only friend . I grabbed a handful of yot from the table and when my father tapped my hand , I raised my eyebrows . " We need energy for homework , " I said . " Is that so ? " My father laughed and picked up more of the sticky candy . He gestured to Sookie and laid three more pieces in her palm . " Then I expect you both to do extra well today . " We went into the back room , rolled up our shirts and lay bare-belly on the cool stone floor to do homework . I pushed my tablet to Sookie . " Ho Sook , " I wheedled , using her formal name to show respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nodded . She was better at art than I was , so I had convinced her to draw my homework as well as hers . I could n't stand it when her pictures-dogs that looked like dogs , people that looked like people-received praise over my smudged circles and stick figures . In return , I would correct her English assignment . Of course , I left a few mistakes , so she would receive only an 80 or 85 percent . Only one of us should have a 100 percent . Only one of us could be class leader . That day , we were to draw self-portraits . As I skimmed over Sookie 's English paper , she stared intently at me . I tried to turn away , but she cupped my chin in her hand . The pads of her fingers flickered along the line of my jaw , my cheek , my nose , across my eyes . Then , gently-so softly I barely felt her touch-she outlined with her caresses the continent of blue-black skin that stretched from my temple to my chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to memorize me with each stroke of her pen . When Sookie handed the paper back to me , I saw that she had drawn a perfect me , a me without the birthmark . Through her eyes , with her touch , I was transformed ; I saw that , with the darkness erased , I had what the old ladies would call bok-saram , a face as lucky as the full moon . After we finished our homework , I walked Sookie home . I liked to visit her apartment , especially when her mother was on base or at the club . Then we had the afternoon and the apartment to ourselves . I liked to wander through the rooms , discovering the new American knickknacks that her mother smuggled home . Once we found a small , big-eyed doll with a curled helmet of yellow hair . Another time we found a slim , green bottle called " Youth Dew " ; when we pressed the button , a mist that smelled like bug spray wafted over our faces . Sometimes we 'd open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho Hos . The first time I tried that chocolate roll , I spit out the cake with its too-sweet lining of sugar cream . I could n't believe that Americans , who could have anything in the world , would eat that . I thought Sookie had played a joke on me , handing me that shiny wrapped present and telling me it was U.S.A. so I would expect something delicious . " You 're mean ! " I cried , scraping my tongue with my fingernails . " That tastes like dirt ! " " No , no , " Sookie laughed , tearing open another silver pouch . " It 's a delicacy ; you have to learn to like it . Really , really , it 's American so you know it 's good . " She and I ate our way through the box before I decided I liked it . I saved the wrappers from those Ho Hos for a long while after that day , pasting them on my bedroom wall with chewed-up bits of rice . I liked the way the shiny paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother , who called anything from America " whore 's rubbish , " threw them out while I was at school . Sometimes Sookie and I would hit the jackpot and find not just snacks , but makeup : Touch and Glow base foundation , Beach Peach and Swinging Pink lipsticks , Coty puff powder . " Your mother gets a lot of presents from the GIs , " I said . " I guess , " she said . " You know how the Joe-sans are . " I nodded , though I really did n't . Once we walked into the apartment when her mother was at the PX and found a darkie GI sleeping in the bed . Sidling up to the bed , we bent over to study him . Sookie poked at him with the corner of her writing tablet . " Is he dead ? " I asked . I did n't bother to whisper , thinking that even if he was n't dead , he was American and could n't hear Korean anyway . Up close he smelled like tobacco , stale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked dark-like the underbelly of the black pig our family once raised . I watched his belly for movement so did n't notice when he opened his eyes . Sookie screamed and when I jerked my head up , I saw his white-white eyes blinking open then shut then open . And I saw his white-white teeth mouthing " Anyang haseyo , baby-sans " like a trained monkey saying a very polite " How do you do ? " before it bites . I screamed , too , I think , and pushed past Sookie to run away . Even from outside the door , we could hear him laughing . This time I made Sookie check the apartment before I entered . " Okay , come in , " she whispered . " Darkie 's not here today . " " How come your mother goes with the ugly , black dogs ? " I grumbled . Sookie shrugged and turned to the desk decorated with makeup containers and beer bottles . I reached over her to touch the most elegant bottle I had ever seen : pasted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-haired woman holding up a bouquet of foaming mugs . " Try some candy , " Sookie said , unwrapping a bar . " It 's called Hersheys . " She broke off a piece and popped it into my mouth . Sweet explosion , dark and bitter as blood , erupted in my mouth . Delicious . American . " My mother said darkies are the kindest , " said Sookie , her teeth glistening with strings of chocolate . " The most grateful . They go with anybody who is lighter than them . Even the ugly ones . " She gulped the last of the Hersheys . " I could get a darkie , " she said , licking her teeth . " Even you could , maybe . " We looked at our faces in the mirror , cataloging our ugliness . My birthmark gleamed , an ebony light , black as Africa . Sookie held up a white jar . " Pond-su cream , " she said to my face in the mirror . " Made in the U.S.A. " " Pansu ? " I repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sookie twisted open the jar and scooped the cream onto her fingers . She sniffed at it . " First time I found this , I thought it smelled so good , I ate it . " She giggled , then poked the tip of her tongue into the mass . " Even knowing how horrible it tastes , I still ca n't resist . " Sookie rubbed the Pond-su over my birthmark . " To lighten and soften your skin . " I held my breath and as she rubbed , I thought I could see my stained skin dissolving under the layer of white cream . " Look , " Sookie breathed . " You are almost beautiful . " Our eyes met in the glass . We looked from my face to Sookie 's . Sookie lifted her arms . " I do n't think there is enough Pond-su cream in this jar to cover my whole body , " she said , trying to joke away her ugliness . " Mmmm , " I said , " then you just have to go to America where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered its arms , stopped smiling . " Yes , " the mouth said . " That 's what I am going to do . " It turned out that Sookie did not need Pond 's Cold Cream to cover up her ugliness . Her ugliness turned into beauty without her having to do a thing . She did n't grow into beauty with womanhood-her boyishness developing into lush curves . Her body stayed long and thin , what the old grandmothers still call unlucky . Her skin did n't lighten with age ; her face did not grow into her overly large eyes . In fact , she looked much the same as an adult as she had in childhood . There were times when we were grown that I saw her as I did when I was younger , and was shocked into remembering that she was as ugly as she always was . And I would be reminded that what had changed was not so much how we looked , but how we looked out of our own eyes , our perceptions of beauty and of ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighborhoods , we though that they-with their high noses , round eyes , and skin either too white or too dark-were ugly . " Kojingi , " we would squeal , shielding our faces from the Big Noses . Or , holding our own noses as we ran away from soldiers who smelled like decaying boots , we sang out , " Shi-che nemsei ! " Slowly , though , we began to view their features as desirable , developing a taste for large noses , double lids , and cow eyes just as we had learned to crave the chocolate candy and cakes we had once thought sweet as dirt .
