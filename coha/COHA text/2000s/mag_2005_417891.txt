Scenarios-stories about the future-are important forecasting tools for organizations . Two business consultants illustrate how scenarios foster strategic thinking , learning , and communication , and how they can be used to develop plans , mitigate uncertainty , and guard against potential problems . // Human beings are wired for stories . Throughout history , knowledge was transferred through speech , pictures , or writing . While there is a role for using other means to convey knowledge , such as PowerPoint slides , they often do not do a good job of communication because they lack contextual meaning . Stories , on the other hand , relate context . Stories , by their very nature , look backward . There is a lot to learn from the past . Nobody wants to go through life in an organization or business looking in a rearview mirror , however , so stories that look forward , or scenarios , are receiving increasing attention in corporate boardrooms and government agencies . Using scenarios in the planning process is a useful strategy for coping with the many uncertainties in today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to account for chaotic events that upset the status quo . The uncertainties in today 's world stem from fast-changing technologies , new business processes , political shifts , terrorist attacks , and other sources , and business leaders need to anticipate them in order to cope with them successfully . One way to do that is through scenarios . Futuristic scenarios-stories that paint a vivid picture of a future state-can help provide vision and leadership in a narrative format as well as communicate the organizational vision . The scenario on page 28 illustrates a future vision for an organization and shows how an enterprise 's architecture fits together as a coherent whole . This fictitious scenario involves the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) , an independent federal agency charged by the U.S. Congress with investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in other modes of transportation . Photograph // The scenario paints a vivid word picture of a future state . It tells a story through the eyes of a protagonist . There is an element of crisis or time-sensitivity , creating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover how the protagonist resolves the crisis . The scenario is short so as not to discourage readers pressed for time . Last , there is a connectedness with the audience-some aspects of the story ( the relationship of the protagonist with her son , for instance ) directly relate to the experiences and interests of the intended audience . The scenario touches equally on human , process , and technology issues . The human element involves sharing tacit and explicit knowledge throughout the organization as common practice . This tacit and explicit knowledge ( intellectual capital ) can then be digitized as structural capital , becoming an organizational asset rather than an individual asset . For example , notice how Joanna Sanchez provides video clips of her recently completed Webcast to the NTSB Academy as part of normal business processes . Her knowledge and experience can now be shared throughout the enterprise . Implied changes in business processes are designed into the scenario . Besides illustrating the future nature of business from a visioning perspective , the scenario shows how networks , computer applications , information , and business processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scenario have been indicated with links to explanatory text in the margin . The illustrations reinforce the scenario by providing visual cues to the narrative . Explicitly informing the reader of the key points of the scenario helps stakeholders analyze the underlying basis . It also fosters continued strategic conversation regarding the future direction of the organization . // Building Scenarios To Achieve Visions How does a nation , city , or governmental agency lead transformations from industrial-age thinking and organization to knowledge-based societies and organizations ? They do so by envisioning it ; visions are the goals , whereas scenarios may show how we can achieve them . Someone once asked Wayne Gretzky , the superstar hockey player , what made him so great on the ice . He replied , " I skate to where the puck is going to be , not to where it has been . " The same hockey maxim applies to governmental organizations at all levels . In Strategic Foresight ( Crown Content , 2002 ) , co-authors Nick Marsh , Mike McAllum , and Dominique Purcell use Singapore among many examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Singapore had an ambitious project called " IT 2000 : Vision of an Intelligent Island " that involved all major sectors of the city-state . The project envisioned that Singapore would become a knowledge hub in southwestern Asia . Today , having harnessed computer powers , the country has developed one of the most-automated ports in the world . Curitiba , Brazil , a city of 1.4 million people , used strategic forethought coupled with systems thinking to increase quality of life and efficiency in traffic congestion , pollution , and waste management , and in avoiding infrastructure development costs for storm and flooding drainage . New Zealand recognized the need to sponsor a national foresight project to move the country from an agricultural and industrial economy to a future grounded in knowledgeera principles . The Ministry of Science and Technology sponsored interviews with 100 leaders from business , politics , the arts , and indigenous groups to establish a consensus on the major drivers in the new economy . Each sector was challenged to develop a 10-year vision , describe pathways to get there , describe competencies and investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus private provision of the necessary investments . The project was endorsed by the New Zealand cabinet and , more importantly , was viewed as a tipping point for new governmental innovation policies and investments . The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) is now writing futuristic scenarios that challenge and amplify the agency 's strategic goals . One of the remaining challenges is to determine how the scenarios will be used in official plans and how they will be used to communicate a future vision to stakeholders , employees , and the public at large from both a visioning and enterprise architecture perspective . The scenario-writing process has also energized FRA senior leadership to analyze underlying assumptions included in the scenarios generated to date . The process has fostered the art of strategic conversation across business units and enhanced the collaborative spirit within the executive suite . Grafting and analyzing futuristic scenarios can help strategic leaders establish a clear sense of direction . They can also help to specify and describe an organization 's future views of its architecture to evaluate potential business and technology operating environments . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a concise manner . They challenge present thinking and foster the art of strategic conversation among stakeholders to anticipate some of the unexpected eventualities of increasingly chaotic and asymmetric domestic and global environments . Scenarios are therefore stories with a purpose . FEEDBACK : Send your comments about this article to letters@wfs.org .
