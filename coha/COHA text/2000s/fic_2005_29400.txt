1 MEMORY I am running . That 's the first thing I remember . Running . I carry something , my arm curled around it , hugging it to my chest . Bread , of course . Someone is chasing me . Stop ! Thief ! I run . People . Shoulders . Shoes . Stop ! Thief ! Sometimes it is a dream . Sometimes it is a memory in the middle of the day as I stir iced tea or wait for soup to heat . I never see who is chasing and calling me . I never stop long enough to eat the bread . When I awaken from dream or memory , my legs are tingling. 2 SUMMER He was dragging me , running . He was much bigger . My feet skimmed over the ground . Sirens were screaming . His hair was red . We flew through streets and alleyways . There we thumping noises , like distant thunder . The people we bounced off did n't seem to notice us . The sirens were screaming like babies . At last we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Soon it wo n't be ladies chasing you . It will be Jackboots . Jackboots ? I said . You 'll see . I wondered who the Jackboots were . Were unfooted boots running along the streets ? Okay , he said , hand it over . Hand what over ? I said . He reached into my shirt and pulled out the loaf of bread . He broke it in half . He shoved one half at me and began to eat the other . You 're lucky I did n't kill you , he said . That lady you took this from , I was just getting ready to snatch it for myself . I 'm lucky , I said . He burped . You 're quick . You took it before Ieven knew what happened . That lady was rich . Did you see the way she was dressed ? She 'll just buy ten more . I ate my bread . More thumping sounds in the distance . What is that ? I asked him . Jackboot artillery , he said . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelling the city . He stared at me . Who are you ? I did n't understand the question . I 'm Uri , he said . What 's your name . I gave him my name . Stopthief. 3 He took me to meet the others . We were in a stable . The horses were there . Usually they would be out on the streets , but they were home now because the Jackboots were boom-booming the city and it was too dangerous for horses . We sat in a stall near the legs of a sad-faced gray . The horse pooped . Two of the kids got up and went to the next stall , another horse . A moment later came the sound of water splashing on straw . The two came back . One of them said , I 'll take the poop . Where did you find him ? said a boy smoking a cigarette . Down by the river , said Uri . He snatched a loaf from a rich lady coming out of the Bread Box . Another boy said , Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking a cigar as long as his face . Uri looked at me . I do n't know . He 's a runt , someone said . Look at him . Stand up , said someone else . I looked at Uri . Uri flicked his finger . I stood . Go there , someone said . I felt a foot on my back , pushing me toward the horse . See , said the cigar smoker , he does n't even come halfway up to the horse 's dumper . A voice behind me squawked , The horse could dump a new hat on him ! Everyone , even Uri , howled with laughter . Explosions went off beyond the walls . The boys who were not smoking were eating . In the corner of the stable was a pile as tall as me . There was bread in all shapes and sausages of all lengths and colors and fruits and candies . But only half of it was food . All sorts of other things glittered in the pile . I saw watches and combs and ladies ' lipsticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fox peering out . What 's his name ? said someone . Uri nodded at me . Tell them your name . Stopthief , I said . Someone crowed , It speaks ! Smoke burst from mouths as the boys laughed . One boy did not laugh . He carried a cigarette behind each ear . I think he 's cuckoo . Another boy got up and came over to me . He leaned down . He sniffed . He pinched his nose . He smells . He blew smoke into my face . Look , someone called , even the smoke ca n't stand him . It 's turning green ! They laughed . The smoke blower backed off . So , Stopthief , are you a smelly cuckoo ? I did n't know what to say . He 's stupid , said the unlaughing boy . He 'll get us in trouble . He 's quick , said Uri . And he 's little . He 's a runt . Runt is good , said Uri . Are you a Jew ? said the boy in my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked my foot . How can you not know ? You 're a Jew or you 're not a Jew . I shrugged . I told you , he 's stupid , said the unlaugher . He 's young , said Uri . He 's just a little kid . How old are you ? said the smoke blower . I do n't know , I said . The smoke blower threw up his hands . Do n't you know anything ? He 's stupid . He 's a stupid Jew . A smelly stupid Jew . A tiny smelly stupid Jew ! More laughter . Each time they laughed , they threw food at each other and at the horse . The smoke blower pressed my nose with the tip of his finger . Can you do this ? He leaned back until he was facing the ceiling . He puffed on the cigarette until his cheeks , even his eyes , were bulging . His face looked like a balloon . It was grinning . I was sure he was going to destroy me with his faceful of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , lifted its tail , and blew a stream of silvery smoke at the horse 's behind . The horse nickered . Everyone howled . Even the unlaugher . Even me . The pounding in the distance was like my heartbeat after running . He must be a Jew , someone said . What 's a Jew ? I said . Answer the runt , someone said . Tell him what a Jew is . The unlaugher kicked ground straw at a boy who had n't spoken . The boy had only one arm . That 's a Jew . He pointed to himself . This is a Jew . He pointed to the others . That 's a Jew . That 's a Jew . That 's a Jew . He pointed to the horse . That 's a Jew . He fell to his knees and scrabbled in the straw near the horse flop . He found something . He held it out to me . It was a small brown insect . This is a Jew . Look . Look ! He startled me . A Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Jew is less than a bug . He threw the insect into the flop . A Jew is that . Others cheered and clapped . Yeah ! Yeah ! I 'm a horse turd ! I 'm a goose turd ! A boy pointed at me . He 's a Jew all right . Look at him . He 's a Jew if I ever saw one . Yeah , he 's in for it all right . I looked at the boy who spoke . He was munching on a sausage . What am I in for ? I said . He snorted . Strawberry babka . We 're all in for it , said someone else . We 're in for it good . From the Hardcover edition .
