Eastern Kentucky , Appalachia September 4 , 2007 <p> Head down , her eyes skimming the ground , Mariah Lockwood walked the woods . She was looking for ginseng , not to dig and sell its roots as so many Appalachians did , but to count the plants that sprang from the precious roots . At this altitude , the herb was especially easy to spot right now with its yellowing leaves and clusters of red berries . The buried treasure of the ginseng root was worth millions to its buyers , especially in the massive Chinese market . Wild wood American ginseng , locally called sang , was getting so rare it was threatened , and that 's where she came in . <p> Seven years ago , her daughter , Jessica , had gotten her the nice-paying job of ginseng counter in these parts . The human-body-shaped ginseng root was on the U.S. government 's endangered species list . If Mariah 's yearly count went down too far , exports would cease and lots of Appalachians , as well as the Chinese and other deep-pocket buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sinking fast , this site would be Mariah 's last stop of the day . Yet , feeling the pinch of hunger , she stopped to pluck some pawpaws . Most places , the little , banana-shaped fruits ripened later , but where the setting sun streamed past the peaks , they were ready early . Their sweet flavor was an acquired taste , but she and Jessie loved them baked and served with cream . <p> As she savored the soft pulp , Mariah wondered what her girl was eating in Hong Kong at that big conference on cultivating ginseng . Probably chop suey , rice and lots of tea . More than once , Jessie had wanted her mother to travel with her , but traveling to Lexington for her doctorate graduation was as far as Mariah wanted to stray from this area she knew and loved . <p> " This is the forest primeval , " Jessie had quoted from some poem the last time the two of them had walked the woods . Ever since Mariah had agreed to let Dr. Elinor Gering take Jessie into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd taken fast to book-learning , though the little town of Deep Down and its people still ran fierce in her blood . Although Jessie used to spend every August here , she 'd been too busy this year , and Mariah could n't help but wonder if Drew Webb 's return had something to do with that . <p> Before she checked her last sang spot  --  one of her secret ones , far back in the smallest hardwood cove huddled up to the stony skirts of Snow Knob  --  she got her a notion to walk the rocks of Bear Creek , just like in the old days . She and Nate had courted here beside its rushing waters , jumping from rock to rock and sitting out on the biggest one to share corn bread and kisses . When they were both nineteen , smack-dab in the middle of that rock  --  their island , they 'd called it  --  he 'd asked her to marry up with him , and Jessie had been born the very next year . The precious , nearby sang patch had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their marriage license and some blankets and dishes to set up housekeeping . <p> With her pack slung over her shoulder , she jumped to the first rock , then leapt from stone to stone , just as she and Nate had , holding hands . The year Jessie turned eight , she 'd lost him in a freak accident when he was repairing a barn roof for extra cash . Though she was still young and could have used someone to support them , she 'd never wanted to wed again . A one-woman man , that was her . And sometimes here , like right now , she felt her curly haired and sky-blue-eyed Nate was still with her , laughing , leaping . No way this place made her sad . <p> Finally , reluctantly , much farther down the creek , she stepped back on firm ground again . In the spring or after a rain , the creek rose high and covered some of these stones as if they were n't here at all  --  like folks you 'd loved and lost but you knew were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts . <p> From the slant of sun , Mariah reckoned it was after seven . Evening shadows stretched long and dark , ' specially here at the foot of Snow Knob . Hurrying now , she set off again . She was fixin ' to get this last site counted before she went home . The familiar forest trail snaked through the fern-carpeted floor ever deeper into the basswood and walnut trees , the kinds sang liked for company . A ragged canopy overhead that threw mottled shade and sun  --  that was sang country . <p> Already she could hear Bear Falls , which fed the creek , crashing down its limestone stairs . She 'd once joshed Seth Bearclaws , the only full-blooded Cherokee round here , by asking if the falls were named after him . But Seth did n't have a sense of humor , ' specially about someone counting or digging sang in the old sacred places of his people . <p> As if the thought of diggers had summoned them , Mariah 's practiced eye picked up signs they 'd been through here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shovel or hoe as a kind of cane as he walked this path . A few small limbs were snapped off too , as if to mark a way back out . She prayed they had n't found her special spot , untouched all these twenty-eight years , maybe even longer . Folks not only poached sang off-season , but outright stole and even killed to get or protect the root . Right now was legal sang season , but diggers had to get a license and fill out all kinds of government forms when they sold it , and the local game was to get around all that . Her friend Cassie had said she thought picking sang was a rite of passage ' round here , and Drew Webb had opined it had something to do with testosterone , or whatever that male hormone was that made men feisty and daring . <p> Vern Tarver , who owned the sang store and historical museum in town , had argued that if George Washington knew the value of ginseng and Daniel Boone made money selling it , why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centuries had considered hunting anything , anytime , their God-given right and could n't abide the government telling them what to do . Not when sang money had brought many of their kin through the Depression or tided them over in other tough times . <p> Mariah figured it did n't take the likes of Vern Tarver to know sang roots were worth as much as one thousand dollars a pound in Asian markets . It was next to useless to try to tell Eastern Kentuckians to let the sang alone for a few years till it matured or to be sure to replant the precious berries when they dug up a site , no matter if the new sheriff said times and laws were different now . <p> The Chinese buyers who came into Vern Tarver 's store , smooth as they were with their clean hands and hard cash , Mariah liked less than poachers or careless diggers . The big money market encouraged ripping out roots , legal season or not , and she knew Vern was only too happy to play middleman to get his cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' specially not since she 'd told him to stop trying to sweetheart her . He 'd near on had a fit when she 'd told him no to his fancy marriage proposal , and if he could n't accept that , just not to come ' round no more . <p> Yes , she saw the footsteps with the hoe marks heading toward her deep woods sang patch . If that fancy GPS thingamajig or the tiny cell phone the government had given her worked worth a darn in these hills and hollers , she 'd use them right now to call Sheriff Drew Webb , tell him to watch in town for illegal sales of prime , old roots . She 'd have him stake out another spot she knew . She could give him the location by the landmarks she always went by , never mind satellite coordinates that were no good , no how here . Why use things in outer space to find where you were , when you knew these woods like your own back forty ? <p> Mariah hunkered down to examine the torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  four-prongers , at least , if she rightly recalled her notes from last count . In all her forty-eight years , this was the weirdest-looking dig she 'd seen . Odd hoe marks , strangely curved , pierced the ground in a pattern . A big hoe , a sharp one , but not carelessly used . No , the slashes in the earth were exact , deep and powerfully placed . <p> She could n't picture anyone from Deep Down doing this so precisely , then stuffing their prizes in the usual pillowcase or backpack and just hightailing it back to town . Strangest of all , the lopped-off yellowing plants and their red berries were laid out in designs around the edge , like some foreign work of art . <p> Then , even through the muted roar of the falls and the rustling leaves , she heard a sound she could n't place . <p> What in creation ? A footstep ? Someone snapping a branch ? She 'd been a wildcrafter almost all her life , picking wild herbs , mushrooms and moss to sell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew the normal forest sounds and scents , but some new , heavy smell  --  fetid and yeasty , or was it moth balls ?  --  came to her on the breeze . <p> Slowly , in the middle of the ravaged , rearranged sang patch , she stood . Turning her head , she tried to pierce the narrow shafts of sun stabbing almost horizontal between the tree trunks . For once , this vast , deep woods seemed to press in on her . Mariah had never claimed to have the sixth sense of some mountain women , including her own mother , but she sensed danger now . Someone else was out here close , something waiting for the shadows to deepen , maybe for her to leave . It could be a bear , but she did n't think so . They liked to make themselves real scarce , and they did n't smell like that . It was n't skunk , she thought , as her nostrils flared . <p> Hair prickled on the nape of her neck . Maybe she 'd surprised a digger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice on his skin , and he was watching , waiting . Maybe he knew she 'd recognize him and did n't want to get caught without a license , afraid she 'd tell Drew Webb . <p> For the first time in her life , alone in the woods , Mariah Lockwood tasted bitter , raw fear . She 'd surprised poachers and diggers before , and they could be as dangerous as those who grew the stuff and guarded it with shotguns and no shut-eye . But she 'd always just made a quick retreat or told them she 'd keep quiet . When a mountain person made a vow , that was that . So why did this feel different ? <p> Hefting her pack with her precious records and lists of landmarks , Mariah edged back toward the path she 'd taken coming in . She would n't walk the rocks of the creek this time , but hightail it back to the old logging road . <p> Then , about thirty feet away , she saw something blocking her path . <p> She let out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , dark thing blinded her . Was it a bear ? This was not some sort of prank or joke . Pure menace reeked from it , along with that smell . <p> She threw her trembling arms over her head to make herself look larger and shouted in a loud voice , " Bear , go ! Go ! " Not only did it not run , but it took a step forward and lifted something in its paw or hand . <p> Not a bear , no , it held itself more erect . And bears did n't use tools . Bulky , maybe human , but grotesque with that fur  --  that obscured face and strange-shaped head . Despite all the legends of forest creatures , none told of an Appalachian yeti or big ape . It had something shiny and sharp in its paw or hand . Hellfire , had that thing been digging sang ? <p> Though it would take hours in the dark to get back down to town another way , she turned and fled . Her pulse pounded in her ears ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack bounced ; the shoulder strap slipped down her arm so the pack almost tripped her . She had n't run dead out in years dead out . <p> Her breath rasped in her throat . Was this a nightmare , and she 'd wake up ? Was that thing a haint like folks said appeared from the dead ? A shape-changing monster from one of Seth 's Cherokee myths ? <p> She took a tumble over a tree root and lost her pack . She scrambled up again , on hands and knees at first , then stumbling , staggering . It was coming after her in wide strides at a jogging pace , breaking tree limbs , hitting something against tree trunks . With stark fear in her soul , she was sweating , shaking . She did not look back at the thing , but looked into her heart . Jessie , she thought , so far away , so smart . Proud of her , she was , though sometimes she regretted giving her away , sending her away <p> Away She had to get away <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Jessica Lockwood was excited to get out of the plush , air-conditioned lobby of her Hong Kong hotel . Most people at the conference spoke decent English , but for this foray outside she 'd hired one of the translators , Sunny Chan , to accompany her to nearby Ko Shing Street , also called Ginseng Street . <p> It was only a little after seven in the morning  --  that would make it just after 7 p.m. of the previous day at home , she thought  --  and she was astounded by the impact of the oppressive weather and the push of people , both in business suits and traditional clothing . Cursing her naturally curly , flyaway tresses , sprung loose by the instant steam bath of humidity , she shoved her chin-length hair back behind her ears and headed out . <p> The crowds seemed as oppressive as the heat . However much she had travelled for research or relaxation , she never quite seemed to shake the habit of judging everything against quiet , little Deep Down , the tiny Appalachian town with a population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her mother would put it . Sometimes in her head , the slow , flat drawl of her mother 's voice battled with the undulating speech of Elinor , the Lexington professor who had been her guardian from the time she 'd turned sixteen . <p> " I ca n't believe how busy it is already , " Jessie told the petite , pretty translator as people rushed past . " I was hoping to talk to a few ginseng sellers before the masses hit . " <p> " Masses hit ? " Sunny echoed in her clipped , British accent as she arched her winged eyebrows . " Oh , you mean before it gets crowded . Believe me , the shop owners would be very honored to speak with you . " <br> Continues ...
