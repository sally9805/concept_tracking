The buzz around its wildly popular digital music box and swank storefronts mask a receding bottom line By Stephen Gandel // MANHATTAN , 5:55 P.M. ON FEB. 20 , AND IN FIVE MINUTES APPLE will begin selling the highly anticipated miniaturized version of its hugely popular iPod . Outside its SoHo store there is an anxious queue of trend-setters and gadget-philes that stretches for more than a big city block . Hundreds of people have been waiting as long as three hours in the cold to get their hands on a Mini . In SoHo , with its art galleries and designer boutiques , this Friday night the retail outpost for the PC maker is the place to be . For Apple CEO Steve Jobs , these are triumphant times . The iPod is more than the most successful digital music player ever : It 's a cultural phenomenon-on a par with Sony 's Walkman-radically altering the way we buy and store music . Since returning seven years ago to the helm of the company he helped found in the 1970s , Jobs has said that innovation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest hit product to come from that decree , and it 's bigger than Apple loyalists and shareholders could have hoped for . Even before the Mini shipped , customers ordered 100,000 at $249 a pop . Apple , in all , should sell nearly one billion dollars ' worth of iPods this year . This apparent success has lured many investors to jump on the Apple bandwagon . Its shares have risen 51% in the past year to a recent $23 . If you love the company 's products-and what 's not to love about their ease of use and elegant design ? - you might be tempted to buy Apple 's shares . But behind the hype and buzz surrounding the iPod and Jobs , there are problems stewing at Apple . Its core computer business , which still accounts for 70% of the company 's sales , is withering . Apple sold just over 3 million computers in its last fiscal year , which ended in September-900,000 less than it sold in fiscal 1996 , the year before Jobs returned . Meanwhile , Apple 's share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . What 's more , despite their soaring sales , iPods are depressing profitability because of their lower profit margin . The result : While Apple 's sales of $6.2 billion last fiscal year were nearly unchanged from 1999 , profits plummeted 90% to $69 million , from $601 million four years ago . It 's unclear what Jobs can do or plans to do to turn around Apple 's fortunes-he refused to talk to MONEY about its future . Of course , as the line outside Apple 's 12,000-square-foot SoHo store grows , none of the company 's problems seem to matter . Kevin Lewis , who has been waiting for three hours , declares , " The iPod Mini is the newest greatest thing . " Scott Dercanin hopes that getting an iPod Mini for his wife will make up for missing Valentine 's Day . Felix Petersen is risking missing his flight back to Berlin so he can own the first iPod Mini in Germany . What 's clear from seeing all these people spend their Friday night waiting on line to buy an iPod is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is whether the trade-off between buzz and the bottom line is worth it . In other words , should Apple 's shareholders be any happier with Jobs ' higher-profile , lower-profit Apple ? Think differently I grew up with Apple . My first computer was a IIe . When the Kolcuns became the first family on the block to own a Macintosh computer , with its compact design and point-and-click mouse , I remember thinking that my friend George was a little cooler than the rest of us . On my first day of college , my parents bought me a Macintosh . Everyone 's did . A Mac , along with a boom box and a mini-fridge , was an essential dorm-room accessory . That was the last Apple PC I ever owned . There is little mystery as to why Apple has gone from the company that created the home-computer market to a perennial also-ran in the PC business . For years , Apple 's computers were more expensive and slower than their Microsoft-and Intel-enabled counterparts . With the Mac on a proprietary , incompatible operating system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , making it harder for Apple to sell its machines . The real question is how Apple survived at all . Most of the companies that challenged the Microsoft and Intel hegemony in the PC business have disappeared . Apple bucked the trend because for stretches of its history it focused on appealing to a price-is-no-object niche audience rather than slugging it out with the likes of Dell for the price-sensitive mass market . In the past , Apple 's profit and loss statement has suffered when the company went after the mass market . When Jobs ran the team that developed the original Mac , the driving motivation was to build a computer that was accessible to everyone , not just to those geeks who wrote software code . Its high $2,500 price , though , capped demand for Jobs ' computer among the masses , and when he was ousted in the mid-1980s in a failed power struggle with then CEO John Sculley , Apple switched gears . Sculley realized Macintosh 's strength was in graphics and heavily marketed the company 's computers to professionals in the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got Apple PCs into schools . Profits soared for the company in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s . When Sculley left in 1993 , the goal at Apple once again became market share . New CEO Gilbert Amelio licensed the Mac 's operating system to other PC makers , which rolled out cheap clones . He spent millions developing an operating system that would run on the Intel standard . But while Apple 's sales rose , profits plunged . In 1996 , Apple 's operations lost $1.2 billion-its worst year . Enter Jobs . He soon scrapped the bastardized operating system and cut off the cloners . He redesigned the Mac in startling colors and released more powerful and expensive Macs for Apple 's core professional-user market . In fiscal 1999 , Apple 's profits hit $600 million . Jobs took his old company from its worst year to its best in 36 months . Mass appeal ? These days Jobs wants to make Apple a broad consumer brand again . His view is that as all types of electronic devices-music players , cameras , camcorders-go digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that manages and organizes this digital output . Jobs hopes that hub will be a Mac . To that end , Apple has rolled out a suite of software called iLife that organizes digital photos as well as allowing you to edit and produce home movies and mix your own music . And there are promises of more to come . " The products Apple will release over the next 12 to 18 months are going to blow the market away , " says Eli Salzmann , co-manager of the Lord Abbett Affiliated fund ( a MONEY 100 member ) , which , with a 4.3% stake , is Apple 's largest outside shareholder . Part of the motivation to develop the iPod and digital media software is to drive computer sales . But so far that has n't worked . In order to make the iPod a success , Apple had to make it compatible with Windows-based PCs . So there is no reason for an iPod lover to buy a Mac . Out of the hundreds of people who were waiting outside Apple 's SoHo store in the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose positive experience with the music player led him to buy an Apple computer . The majority of the people , many of whom were there to buy their second or third iPod , owned Windows-based PCs and had no intention of switching to a Mac . As for the iTunes music service , Apple makes little on downloads . Of the 99 it charges for each song , it has to pay the record labels 65 . Another 25covers the cost of distribution and credit-card processing . So even if you sell an impressive 30 million songs , as Apple claims , that adds up to only a paltry $2.7 million . Jobs ' other strategy to boost market share is Apple retail outlets . In 2001 he began opening company-owned Apple stores . The company now has 76 branches and expects to open another six by year-end . Jobs says Apple has no plans to become a retailer . The strategy is to open stores in high-profile locations to showcase Apple 's products and demonstrate their central position in the digital media world . Apple calls the venture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . But so far the stores have done little to increase market share , and they could be bleeding a lot more red ink than Apple is letting on . Over the past year and a half , four of Apple 's former authorized resellers have sued the company , asserting that its stores competed unfairly with them . Among their claims : Apple cuts sweetheart deals with its own stores to mask losses , such as charging them less for hardware and warranties than it does Apple 's resellers . Tom Santos , one of the plaintiffs , estimates that Apple 's stores would have lost as much as $80 million in 2003 had they been paying the same prices for inventory as the resellers paid . An Apple spokeswoman says the company wo n't comment on pending litigation . In the past , Apple has said that its own stores pay the same prices that resellers do . Apple 's core This much is certain : Jobs ' mass-appeal strategy has crimped the company 's historically high profit margins . Apple 's net profit margin is just 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Apple 's earnings would have been worse had it not been for $4.8 billion the company has in cash and short-term securities . In fact , the cash hoard made more money last year than Apple 's operations-which lost $1 million while the computer maker booked a $69 million gain on interest income . Even when you factor in Apple 's $13 a share in cash and almost no debt , the company 's stock , at a recent $23 , trades at 20 times estimated 2004 earnings . Dell 's shares , on the other hand , go for 26 times projected 2004 earnings-but its business is three times as profitable as Apple 's . The company 's supporters say current profits matter little because Jobs has proved time and time again that he can create new products and trailblaze markets . That may be so , but as Transamerica portfolio manager Chris Bonavico , who does n't own Apple 's stock , notes , " Apple will remain a company that is neat from a product and consumer standpoint but crap from an investor standpoint . " Sidebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit problems are absent at Steve Jobs ' other company , animation studio Pixar ( PiXR ) . The maker of Finding Nemo netted an astounding 48 on each dollar of sales . That 's better than all but one ( Ambac Financial ) of the firms in the S &P's; 500-stock index . In February , Pixar broke its production deal with Disney , assuring it a larger portion of its future films ' profits . Of course , Pixar will assume more of the risk . At $66 , its shares do n't reflect this added burden , - S.G. // <p>
