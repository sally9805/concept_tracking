Scouting is state-of-the-art , yet judging which NFL players will pan out remains a gamble . Maybe they 're not the ones who should be studied // Six years ago I asked a pro football scout why , despite the enormous amounts of time and money devoted to it by NFL think tanks , the annual college draft produces such erratic results . Nobody , I noted , had been anxious to select Johnny Unitas or Bart Starr or Joe Montana-by my measure the three greatest quarterbacks of the last fifty years , winners of eleven NFL championships between them . By NFL standards they were n't very big , and did n't have great arms . ( Unitas was the 102nd player drafted in 1955 , Starr was the 200th in 1956 , and Montana the 82nd in 1979 . ) Yes , he replied , but that was in the Stone Age . Scouting had become so sophisticated in the two decades since Montana was drafted that a mistake like that was much less likely . Later that month , Tom Brady was taken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patriots , the 199th player selected overall . Brady would lead his team to three Super Bowls before he was twenty-eight . Though he measured high on intelligence tests , most scouts had been unimpressed with his skills . It was Patriots offensive coordinator Charlie Weis ( now the Notre Dame head coach ) who was adamant about drafting Brady . When I asked Weis what it was that he saw in the young quarterback , he told me , " Call it a gut feeling , but to me he had the look of a bulldog . " Bear Bryant was fond of saying , " It ai n't the size of the dog in the fight ; it 's the size of the fight in the dog . " Nowadays , computer analysis gives teams instant comparisons of hundreds of ballplayers , most of whom also take the Wonderlic test ( see sidebar , page 154 ) for determining intelligence . But , for all the information available to scouts and teams about a player 's physical attributes and mental makeup , the evaluation of NFL hopefuls remains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character have so much to do with success , " says Marv Levy , the former Buffalo Bills head coach and current president and general manager . " You ca n't just look at a player and his achievements in college and say that he 'll be successful in the NFL . You do n't know how he 'll adapt to the speed of NFL football . You do n't know how he 'll react to playing against a higher level of competition . " And even if one knew these things , Levy points out , there 's another major stumbling block : " You have to match him up with the right system and the right coach . " Photograph // The most spectacular crash-and-burn in NFL draft history was Ryan Leaf . In 1998 , there were two fabulous quarterback prospects who were thought by nearly everyone to have it all-size , smarts , and arm strength : Washington State 's Leaf and Tennessee 's Peyton Manning . Not before or since have there been two quarterbacks whose pro potential was more hotly argued going into the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . The San Diego Chargers were so convinced that Leaf was a blue-chipper that they traded three top draft picks and two players to acquire the second pick , chose Leaf , and then gave him an unprecedented $11.25 million bonus . Leaf played two horrendous seasons for San Diego before being released , then bounced from Tampa Bay to Dallas and , finally , Seattle . He played his last professional football game at age twenty-five . Manning , by contrast , has been the most productive passer in the league over the last seven years . Observers are pretty much in agreement that Leaf 's failure was due to lack of maturity , but that does little to explain another legendary quarterback flameout : Rick Mirer . After a sensational college career at Notre Dame , Mirer was chosen by the Seattle Seahawks with the second pick of the 1993 draft . But he never caught on in Seattle , and after four years had thrown fifteen more interceptions than touchdown passes . ( NFL quarterbacks typically average the same number of touchdowns as interceptions early in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes than interceptions in his first four seasons . ) Mirer played nine seasons with five teams before his career ended in 2004 . Steve Silverman , who followed both of their careers as a reporter for Pro Football Weekly , offers this assessment : " Leaf had gotten by for a long time on sheer ability . By the time he got to the pros , he thought he knew it all and would n't take instruction . He failed to develop . He was arrogant . Mirer was just the opposite . He was used to winning , and when he did n't win in the pros , he lost his confidence in his own judgment and listened to everyone 's criticism of him . After his first couple of seasons , he was shell-shocked . Leaf blamed everyone else when he lost , while Mirer put all the blame on himself . " Such attributes ca n't be measured by tests of physical ability ( where both Leaf and Mirer ranked nearly even with Manning ) or intelligence ( Leaf 's Wonderlic score was reportedly just a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Yogi Berra , an athlete who won a record ten World Series rings without the apparent capacity for scoring high on any physical or intelligence tests , may have said it best : " Half this game is 90 percent mental . " According to Marv Levy , it 's the percentage of the game that 's mental that makes the difference between winners and losers at the professional level . " By the time a player reaches the NFL , " he explains , " it 's really no longer a question of talent . All the players have tremendous talent . If there 's one thing I want to know about a player , it 's how he will react under fire , what kind of decisions he 'll make in tough situations-if he has the ability to make reads on the fly . " But it 's precisely that ability that still ca n't be predicted . In fact , some wonder whether the college game has n't become so regimented that it discourages the ability to perform with grace under pressure that 's so prized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more talented players in the game than now , " says Bart Starr , who quarterbacked Vince Lombardi 's Green Bay Packers to five championships in the 1960s and was later a head coach himself for nine seasons . " I ca n't help wondering , though , if it was n't more fun to play years ago , when it was more of a player 's game . Today , from high school on up , in nearly every situation there are so many substitutes , so many specialists , and so many coaches deciding plays that the players themselves might feel programmed . When I played , a quarterback called most of his own plays . Now decisions are made on the sideline by a committee of coaches . The time comes when every player has to make quick decisions in tight situations , but in many cases their training has n't prepared them for it . In fact , it may have prepared them against it . " Talented players like Ryan Leaf and Rick Mirer might have succeeded in the pros if they had found the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm often surprised , " says three-time Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Walsh , " at how seldom a coach 's ability to motivate is n't considered when analyzing a player 's success or failure . A lot of guys who you see go bust their first time around in the NFL do end up fulfilling their early expectations , but with different teams and different coaches . The trick for a really smart coach is to make his players see how smart he is without destroying their confidence in their own intelligence . " The NFL may be focusing their efforts in the wrong place . Maybe tests should be designed to grade coaches-they 're the ones who have to mold a disparate group of young men into a team . One of the NFL 's great stories is how Vince Lombardi turned the Green Bay Packers into the first great football dynasty of the modern age . When Lombardi took over the Packers , in 1959 , he inherited a team of high-round draft picks that had finished 1-10-1 the previous season . Working with almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the following year he had the Packers in the NFL championship game . He succeeded in large part by putting players into positions more suited to their talents . For instance , Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Paul Hornung was switched to running back , and running back Herb Adderly was remade into an All-Pro defensive back . Lombardi 's greatest talent , though , once he had matched the players with their proper roles in his system , was to convince them that they could win . Is there a brief definition for this quality in a coach ? " Yes , " says Walsh . " It 's called the ability to inspire . " The Houston Texans , by virtue of their league-worst 2-14 record last season , have the No. 1 pick in this year 's draft . By most accounts , they 'll select either USC 's Heisman Trophy-winning tailback Reggie Bush or quarterback Vince Young of the national champion Texas Longhorns . Both have been the subject of extensive state-of-the-art research , from computer analysis of the results of their physical and mental tests to frame-by-frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea for Bush and Young to devote a similar amount of time and effort to studying the coaching staffs of the teams they 'll be playing for before signing their pro contracts-no matter how lucrative those contracts are .
