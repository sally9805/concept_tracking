WAR SEASON <p> IN SPACE THERE ARE NO seasons , and this is true too of the silver wheels that are humanity 's homes beyond Earth and the silver ships that carried us there . In autumn there are no fallen leaves , and in spring , no living flowers ; no summer winds , no winter snow . There are no days except our own calendars and the stars ' slow candles in the dark . <p> The Network has known only one war , and that war ended before it began . This is why , of course , the Network 's ships trapped in q-space- that otherwhere of superpositions and spindrift possibilities - wield waveform interrupters , and why , though I was Rachel 's friend , I killed her across several timelines . But the tale begins with our final exam , not my murders . <p> THE TEST <p> You are not required to answer this question . However , the response ( should you attempt one ) will be evaluated . If you decide otherwise , key in " I DECLINE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can not proceed to the next item without deciding , and there will be no later opportunity . <p> Your time remaining is- : - : <p> In her essay " The Tyranny of Choice and Observation , " Shinaai Rei posits a " black abacus " that determines history 's course by " a calculus of personalities and circumstances , cause and effect and chance . " ( You are not expected to be familiar with this work ; the full text is restricted . ) <p> In light of this , under what circumstances is war justified ? What about assassination ? Consider , for example , Skorzeny 's tactics during World War II , police actions against the Candida Rebellion , and more recently , terrorists ' sabotage of relay stations . You may cite current regulations and past precedents to support your answer . <p> As you do , remember the following points : <p> 1 . During the 76.9 years ( adjusted time ) that the Pancommunications Network has been in place , no planet- or station-born conflict has found expression in realspace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer requires absolute reliability , treason is subject to the death penalty . <p> 3 . " Reductio ad absurdum is one of a mathematician 's finest weapons . It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit : a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece , but the mathematician offers the game . " -G . H. Hardy ( 1877-1947 ) <p> THE RESULTS <p> Fifty-seven percent of that year 's class declined the question , or so they thought . The computers recorded every keystroke and false start for further analysis . Of those who did respond , the ratio of essay length to time taken ( after adjustments for typing speed ) matched the predicted curve . <p> Rachel was the exception . Her answer took 5.47 minutes to compose ( including one self-corrected typo ) and three sentences to express . <p> The records knew her as Rachel Kilterhawk . Her comrades in command training knew her as the Hawk . In later times and other lives , they would call her Rachel the Ruthless . Neither of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUEEN 'S GAMBIT <p> Rachel was one of the first to leave the exam . Her cadet 's uniform was creased where she had bent over the keyboard , and even now her hands shook . I did what I could , she thought , and set her mind on other things : the spindles of growing plants , the taste of thrice-recycled water , the cold texture of metal ... the sea , from her one visit to Earth , with its rush of foam and salt-sprinkled breezes . <p> She went to hydroponics , where water warbled through the pipes and the station 's crops grew in identical green rows , a spring without end . In a corner of the garden she picked out a bench and sat with her legs drawn up , her hands on her knees . Nearby was a viewport - a viewscreen , actually , filtering the stars ' radiation into intensities kinder to human eyes . <p> After a while her hands stopped trembling , and only then did she notice the other cadet . He had dark hair and darker eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp with sweat . " Do you believe in angels ? " he asked her . <p> Rachel blinked . " Not yet . Why ? " <p> He gestured at the viewscreen , tracing unnamed constellations and the pale flash of an incoming ship 's q-wave . " It must be a cold thing to die in space . I like to think there are angels who watch over the ships . " The boy looked away and flushed . <p> She gazed at the fingerprints he had left on the screen . " Angels ' wings . " <p> It was his turn to blink . " Pardon ? " <p> " The q-waves , " she said . " Like wings . " <p> He might have laughed ; others often did , when Rachel with her quicksilver thoughts and quiet speech could n't find the right words . She was startled when he rubbed his chin , then nodded . " Never thought of it that way . " He smiled at her . " I 'm Edgar Kerzen . And you ? " <p> She returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Dawning realization : " You 're the Hawk . No one else would 've torn through the exam like that . " <p> " But so did you . " <p> Edgar shrugged . " I aced math and physics , but they killed me on ethics . " <p> She heard the unsaid words : Let 's talk about something else . Being Rachel , she was silent . And found herself startled again when he accepted the silence rather than filling it with words . She would come to treasure that acceptance . <p> BLACK : KNIGHT 'S SACRIFICE <p> The first life , first time I killed Rachel , it was too late . She had already given her three-sentence answer to the Pandect 's exam ; won command of the starhiker Curtana , one of twenty-six ever built ; and swept from the Battle of Red Lantern to the Siege of Gloria on the shredded wings of a q  --  wave . After Gloria , her name passed across the relays as both battle-cry ( for the Network ) and curse ( for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great to erase , her influence too great to stop the inevitable blurring of murder and necessity . <p> After the siege , we had a few days to remember what sleep was , to forget the silence of battle . Space is silent , though we want thunder with our lightning , the scream of metal and roar of guns . I think this was true even for Rachel , because she believed in right silences and wrong silences . <p> By fortune or otherwise we had shared postings since we left academy , since that first meeting in hydroponics . Command was short on officers , but shorter still on ones who worked together like twin heartbeats . I stood beside her when she received the captain 's wing on her uniform and again when we learned , over the relays , that the scoutship Boomerang 's kamikaze destruction of a station had plunged one probability-space into war . I stood beside her and said nothing when she opened fire on Gloria Station , another of the few q-space stopovers . It harbored a Movement ship determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple of incoherence . <p> One people , one law , said the Network . There were too many factions at a time when humanity 's defenses were scattered across the stars : conglomerates with their merchant fleets , colonies defending their autonomy , freetraders who resented the Network 's restrictions . Once the Pancommunications Network had only been responsible for routing transmissions between settlements and sorting out discrepancies due to time dilation . Someone had to maintain the satellite networks that knit everyone together and someone had to define a law , however , so the Network did . <p> In light of this , under what circumstances is war justified ? <p> A ship 's captain has her privacy , but we were docked and awaiting repairs , and I knew Rachel 's thoughts better than my own . She had her duty , and if that duty demanded it , she would pay in blood . Including her own , if it came to that , but she was too damned brilliant to die in battle . Because she was the Hawk , and when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three sentences . <p> I came upon Rachel deep in the ship 's hold , in an area closed off for tomorrow 's repairs . Her eyes , when she raised them to me , were the wild gray of a winter sky , unlike the carbon-scored gray of the torn bulkheads behind her . These days our world was defined by shades of gray and the reflections therein . <p> Soon we would be forced to leave the colorless haven of q-space , since the last few stations could barely sustain themselves or the remaining ships . For a while , the Network and the Independence Movement had cannibalized any new ships who entered q-space despite the perils of merging q-waves , gutting them of supplies , people , and news . Once a ship exited into realspace , our own fluctuating history would collapse into a single outcome , and nobody was willing to plunge the realspace world into war , especially one in the enemy 's favor . New ships no longer showed up , and God knew what we 'd done to realspace transportation and logistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue . Rachel shot them down . She was determined to win or stop the war in every life , every timeline , and she might even succeed . <p> She noticed my presence and , for once , spoke before I could . " Edgar . While I 'm here , more people are dying . " Her voice was restless , like the beating wings of a bird in a snowstorm . <p> " We 'll find out about it on relay , " I said , wishing I could say something to comfort her , to gentle those eyes , that voice , but Rachel had never much believed in words , even mine . <p> " Do you think angels fly between probability-spaces to harvest our souls ? " <p> I closed my eyes and saw the afterimages of a ship 's waveform disintegration , translated into images the human mind could interpret . " I wish I knew . " I was tired of fighting and forcing myself to remember that the bright , undulating ribbons on the tactical display represented people and what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave and let the multiplicity of battles end , but I knew she would n't . <p> For a long time Rachel said nothing , lacing and unlacing her fingers together . Then her hands relaxed and she said , " How did you know to find me here ? " <p> Nothing but curiosity from a woman who had killed civilians , whom I had always followed . Her duty and her ruthlessness were a greater weapon than any battleship the Network had left . My angel , an angel of death . <p> My hands were a weapon and her trust , a weakness . <p> " I 'll always find you , my dear , " I said , reaching out as though to massage her shoulders , and interrupted the balance of her breath and brain and heartbeat . She did not fight ; perhaps she knew that in other probability  --  spaces , I was still hers . I thought of Red Lantern . My memories held lights and lines in red or amber , autumn colors ; tactical screens , terse voices . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After she stopped moving , I laid her down . I was shaking . Such an easy thing , to kill . Escape was the hard part , and I no longer cared . <p> THE DARKEST GAME <p> Schrodinger 's cat has far more than nine lives , and far fewer . All of us are unknowing cats , alive and dead at once , and of all the might-have  --  beens in between , we record only one . <p> We had the catch-me catch-me-not of quantum physics , then quantum computers , oracles that scanned possibilities . When we discovered a stardrive that turned ships into waves in a sea of their own - q-space  --  we thought we understood it . We even untangled navigation in that sea and built our stations there . <p> Then , the echoes . Ghosts in probability-space , waveforms strung taut from waypoint to waypoint , snapshot to snapshot . Enter q-space and you throw a shard of the universe into flux . Exit it , and the shard crystallizes , fixing history over the realspace interval . Shinaai Rei - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Before the Boomerang , there had neither been a war nor ships that interrupted the night with their flashfire battles . Then she destroyed a civilian station , and the world shifted into a grand game of chess , probabilities played one on the other , ships that winged into q-space never to return . Why take risks in war when you can try everything at once and find out who will win ? <p> WHITE : CANDLES <p> Theirs had been one of many patrolships guarding the satellite network . Sometimes threats breathed through the relays , but nobody was willing to disrupt the web of words between worlds . Rachel had known Network duty was tedious , but did n't mind . Edgar was with her , and around they went , never twice tracing the same path . Their conversations , too , were never twice the same . <p> Everything had turned awry , but when smoke seared her lungs or she had to put the crew on half-rations again , she remembered . Edgar was all that remained from that quiet time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readout , she gazed fondly at the dark , tousled hair and the steady movements of his hands . <p> On patrol , through the long hours , Rachel had come to trust his motions , his words , his velvet voice and the swift thoughts behind them . Even his smile , when smiles often made false promises . But there came dark moments , too . <p> Once , after watching a convoy of tradeships streak by , Edgar said , " What would happen if all the satellites went out ? " <p> She explored the idea and found it sharp to the touch . " Candles . " <p> He understood . " Only a matter of time before everything fails . Imagine living in a future when the worlds drop silent one by one . " <p> Rachel reached out and stroked his hand . " It wo n't happen yet , " she said . Not for a long time , and we are here ; the Network is here . <p> He folded her hand in his , and for a moment his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " The exam . " Years ago , and she still remembered the way her hands had shook afterward . What Edgar had said , she never asked . He gave her the same courtesy . <p> She wondered now if he had foreseen the war and chosen to make himself a part of it , with the quicksilver instinct she treasured . She suspected that his dreams , his visions of other probability-spaces , were clearer than hers , which spoke merely of a battle to be won , everywhere and when . Rachel decided to ask him the next time they were both awake and alone . <p> In some of her lives , she never had the opportunity . <p> BLACK : A RIDDLE <p> How long can a war go on if it never begins ? <p> WHITE : THE BLOODY QuEEN <p> The Battle of Seven Spindles . The Battle of Red Lantern . The Siege of Gloria . The Battle of Crescent . Twenty-one stations and four battles fought across the swirl of timelines . Rachel counted each one as it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ q-space , she faced the 45th ship . The Curtana was a hell of red lights and blank , malfunctioning displays ; she had never been meant to go this long without a realspace stopover . The crew , too , showed the marks of a long skirmish with their red eyes and blank faces . They saw her as the Hawk , unassailable and remote ; she never revealed otherwise to them . <p> The communications officer , Thanh , glanced up from his post and said , " The Shanghai Star requests cease-fire and withdrawal . " A standard request once , when ships dragged governments into debt and lives were to be safeguarded , not spent . A standard request now , when ships were resources to be cannibalized after they could no longer sustain life . <p> Rachel did not hesitate . " No . " The sooner attrition took its toll , the sooner they would find an end to this . <p> Her crew knew her too well to show any surprise . Perhaps , by now , they were beyond it . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to you . " <p> " You mean he wants to know why . " For once words came easily to her : she had carried this answer inside her heart since she understood what war meant . " Tell the Shanghai Star that there 's no easy escape . That we can make the trappings of battle as polite as we like , and still people die . That the only kind end is a quick one . " <p> Rachel heard Edgar approach her from the side and felt his warmth beside her . " They 'll die , you know , " he murmured . <p> She startled herself by saying , " I 'm not infallible . " Battle here , like the duels of old , was fast and fatal . A modification of the stardrive diverted part of the q-wave into a powerful harmonic . If an inverse Fourier breakdown of the enemy ship 's waveform was used to forge the harmonic , and directed toward that waveform , the stardrive became an interrupter . The principle of canceling a wave with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to the ship 's control computers before anyone else did . A battle was ninety percent maneuver and data analysis to screen out noise from other probability-spaces , ten percent targeting . <p> Her attention returned , then , to the lunge-and-parry , circle-and  --  retreat of battle . <p> At the end , it was her fifth battle and victory . Only the Curtana remained to tell of it . <p> BLACK : THE TRAITOR KNIGHT <p> Time and again , Rachel 's crew on the Curtana speculates that she dreams of Fourier breakdowns and escape trajectories , if she dreams at all . The Hawk never sleeps , they say where Rachel is n't supposed to hear , and so she never corrects the misimpression . <p> Sometimes I was her first officer and sometimes her weapons officer . Either way I knew her dreams . In a hundred lives , they never changed : dreams of the sea and of the silver ships , silver stations , that were her only homes ; dreams of fire that burned without smoke , death that came without sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed her a hundred times . Once with my hands and once with a fragment of metal . Sometimes by betraying her orders and letting the ship hurtle into an interrupter 's wave , or failing to report an incoming hostile . On the rare instances that I failed , I was executed by her hand . We knew the penalty for treason . <p> Several times I killed her by walking away when she called out to me as the ship 's tortured , aging structure pinned her down . Several times more I died , by rope or knife or shipboard accident , leaving her behind , and took her soul with me . <p> I have lived more probabilities than she will ever dream . Doubtless the next will be similar . I know every shape of her despair , every winter hymn in her heart ... why she looks for angels and only finds me . I am tired of killing her . Make your move and end the game . <p> WHITE : A CHANGE IN TACTICS <p> When it was her turn to sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , ships with dark wings and darker songs . But she woke always to Edgar 's hand tracing the left side of her jaw , then her shoulder , and that touch , like her duty aboard the Curtana , defined her mornings . It was the only luxury she permitted herself or Edgar . The rest of the crew made no complaint . His were the hardest , most heartbreaking tasks , and they knew it . <p> His dreams were troubled , she knew . Sometimes they surfaced in his words , the scars of unfought battles and unfinished deaths , merciless might-have-beens . Stay here , she thought . Of all the choices , one must be a quiet ending . <p> Perhaps he heard her , in the silence . <p> BLACK : CHECK AND MATE <p> Rachel 's response to the ethics question took 5.47 minutes and three sentences . Mine took more lives . mine and hers and others ' than I can count . <p> RACHEL 'S SEASON <p> In space there are no seasons , and this is as true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . But we measure our seasons anyway : by a smile , a silence , a song . I measured mine by Rachel 's deaths . Perhaps she will measure hers differently . <p> Your move , my dear . <p> - for JCB <p> IMG
