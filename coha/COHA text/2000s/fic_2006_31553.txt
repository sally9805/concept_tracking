Chapter One Mental illness runs in the Purcell family . I 'd diligently typed this conclusion at the top of the report written on my word-processing program . I 'd been so full of myself , so pleased with my thorough research and keen detecting skills that I 'd smiled a Cheshire Cat smile for weeks on end . That smug grin hung around just like the cat 's . It was on my face when I woke in the morning and it was there on my lips as I closed my eyes at night . I spent hours in self-congratulation : Oh , Jane Kelly , private investigator extraordinaire . How easy it is for you to be a detective . How good you are at your job . How exceptional you are in your field ! However ... I was n't smiling now . Directly in front of me was a knife-wielding , delusional , growling , schizophrenic-the situation a direct result of my investigation into the Purcells . In disbelief I danced left and right , frantic to avoid serious injury . I looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doomed and downright FURIOUS at Dwayne Durbin . It was his fault I was here ! It was his ridiculous belief in my abilities that had put me in harm 's way ! Had n't I told him I 'm no good at confrontation ? Had n't I made it clear that I 'm damn near a chicken-heart ? Does n't he ever listen tome ? His fervent belief in me was going to get me killed ! Gritting my teeth , I thought : I hope I live long enough to kill Dwayne first .... I was deep into the grunt work necessary to earn my license as a private investigator . Dwayne Durbin , my mentor , had finally convinced me I would be good at the job . His cheerleading on my behalf was not entirely altruistic : he wanted me to come and work for him . I 'd resisted for a while but circumstances had arisen over the summer that had persuaded me Dwayne just might be right . So , in September I became Dwayne Durbin 's apprentice-and then I became his slave , spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing all his dog work-which really irritates me , more at myself than him , because I 'd known this was going to happen . And though I resented all the crap-work thrown my way , Dwayne was n't really around enough for me to work up a head of steam and vent my feelings . He was embroiled in a messy divorce case for Camellia " Cammie " Purcell Denton . His association with the Purcell family was why I 'd delved into the Purcell family history in the first place . I admit this was more for my own edification than any true need on Dwayne 's part , but I figured it could n't hurt . That particular September afternoon-the afternoon I wrote my conclusion on the report-was sunny and warm and lazy . It was a pleasure to sit on Dwayne 's couch , a piece of furniture I 'd angled toward his sliding glass door for a view of the shining waters of Lake Chinook . I could look over the top of my laptop as I wirelessly searched databases and historical archives and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Resentment faded . Contentment returned . After all , it 's difficult to hold a grudge when , apart from some tedium , life was pretty darn good . My rent was paid , my mother 's impending visit had yet to materialize , my brother was too involved with his fiance to pay me much attention , and I had a dog who thought I was ... well ... the cat 's meow . I finished the report and typed my name on the first page , mentally patting myself on the back for a job well done . Reluctantly , I climbed to my feet and went to check out Dwayne 's refrigerator . If he possessed anything more than beer and a suspect jar of half-eaten , orange-colored chili con queso dip , life would pass from pretty darn good to sublime . My gaze settled on a lone can of diet A &W; root beer . Not bad . Popping the top , I returned to the couch and my laptop . Intending to concentrate , my eyes kept wandering to the scene outside the sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deck chair , was now making desultory calls on his cell phone . He stepped in and out of my line of vision as I hit the print button , wirelessly sending information to Dwayne 's printer . Nirvana . I 'm technologically challenged , but Dwayne has a knack for keeping things running smoothly and efficiently despite my best efforts . Since I 'd acquired my newest laptop-a gift from an ex-boyfriend-I 'd slowly weaned myself from my old grinder of a desktop . This new , eager slimmed-down version had leapfrogged me into a new era of computers . It fired up and slammed me onto the Internet faster than you can say , " Olly olly Oxenfree . " ( I have no idea what this means but it was a favorite taunt from my brother Booth who was always crowing it when we were kids , gloating and laughing and skipping away , delighted that he 'd somehow " got " me . Which , when I think about it , still has the power to piss me off . ) The new laptop untethered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my bedroom . Now , I 'm mobile . I bring my work over to Dwayne 's , which he highly encourages . I 'm fairly certain Dwayne hopes I 'll suddenly whirl into a female frenzy of cleaning and make his place spotlessly clean . Like , oh , sure , that 's going to happen . Still , I enjoy my newfound freedom and so Dwayne 's cabana has become a sort of office for me . I claimed my spot on his well-used but extremely comfortable one-time blue , now dusty gray , sofa early . Being more of a phone guy , Dwayne spends his time on his back deck/dock and conducts business outdoors as long as it is n't raining or hailing and sometimes even if it is . Feeling absurdly content ( always a bad sign for me , one I choose to ignore ) I checked my e-mail . Nothing besides a note from someone named Trixie which I instantly deleted . One day I made the mistake of opening one of those spam e-mails about super hot sex and ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penis enlargement ads and/or promises . If I did n't have penis envy before , I sure as hell do now . Eighteen inches ? Where would you park that thing on a daily basis ? There are a lot of hours when it 's not in use ... unless you count the fact that it functions as some guys ' brains . I have met these sorts , but I try not to date them . Makes for uncomfortable dinners out where I talk and they just stare at my breasts . If I had serious cleavage I could almost understand , but my fear is that it simply means my conversation is really boring . My cell phone rang with a whiny , persistent ring . I am going to have to figure out how to change it . A James Bond theme would be nice . I snatched it up without looking at Caller ID . An error . Marta Cornell , one of Portland 's most voracious divorce lawyers , was on the line . " Jane ! " Marta 's voice shouted into my ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time she may have shot one of my inner ear bones-the hammer , the anvil or the stirrup-into the center of my brain . Who names those things , anyway ? " You know Dwayne was working for Cammie Purcell , " Marta charged ahead without waiting for my response . " Jane ? Are you there ? " " Yes . " I was cautious . Marta was Cammie 's divorce lawyer and Dwayne had been following Cammie 's husband Chris around for several weeks , intent on obtaining proof that he possessed a second family . Said family was apparently sucking up some Purcell money . Chris Denton was n't exactly a bigamist . He 'd never actually married his other " wife . " But he had children with her and he divided his time between them and Cammie . Stunted as he was maturity-wise , I was impressed he could juggle two relationships . Sometimes I find it difficult just taking care of my dog . " That job 's pretty much finished , is n't it ? " Marta asked . " I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cases like Cammie 's seemed to undulate : sometimes the work lasted days on end ; other times it nearly died . When Dwayne had first discovered the dirt on Chris , he 'd disclosed it to Cammie and Marta . With divorce in the offing , Marta must have seen greenbacks floating around her head , but weirdly , Cammie 's only remark had been a question : " What are the childrens ' names ? " Later I 'd learned this query had some merit after all : Chris 's two girls-with his almost wife-were Jasmine and Blossom . When Dwayne told Cammie their names her face crumpled as if she were going to cry . But then she fought off the tears and went into a quiet rage instead . " Her eyes looked like they were going to bug out of her head , " Dwayne told me later . " I took a step backward . Her hands were clenching and unclenching . She wanted to kill me for telling her . A part of my brain was searching the room for a weapon . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a long look . " I do n't ever want to be in a room alone with her again . No wonder the bastard left her . " Camellia 's strange behavior was explained when it surfaced that many of the female members of the Purcell family were named after flowers . Apparently Chris 's non-Purcell " wife " had fallen for this weird obsession as well , and since it was a decidedly Purcell quirk , Cammie appeared ready to kill over it . This was about the time I decided to indulge in some Purcell family history . Hence , my report . " Jasper Purcell would like to meet with you , " Marta said , bringing me back to the present with a bang . " He needs a P.I . " " You mean , meet with Dwayne ? " I asked , puzzled . I was the research person , not the A-list investigator . " Nope . " Her voice sounded as if she were trying to tamp down her excitement . Must be more money involved . " He called this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's something of a personal nature , to do with his family . " " This is Dwayne 's case , " I reminded her . I did n't add that Dwayne wanted to wash his hands of the whole thing . " Jasper wants someone else to tackle this one . Says it 's sensitive . " I glanced through the sliding glass door to where Dwayne , who 'd removed his shirt in the unseasonably hot , early October sunshine , was standing on the dock . His back was hard , tan and smooth . Someone who knew him drove by in a speedboat and shouted good-natured obscenities . Dwayne turned his head , grinned and gave the guy the finger . " How sensitive ? " I asked . " He said he wants a woman . " I was n't sure what I thought of that . Just how many private investigators did the Purcell family need ? " I 'll have to make sure this is okay with Dwayne . " " I talked to Dwayne this morning , " Marta revealed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purcells but if you wanted to step in , he was all for it . " Nice of Marta to keep that tidbit of information back while she felt me out on the subject . I did n't like being manipulated , and I was pretty sure that was what she was doing . Also , I knew Dwayne 's feelings about Cammie , but this sounded suspicious . Dwayne likes to cherry-pick assignments . That 's why I 'd been relegated to grinding research and drudge work . I narrowed my eyes at his back until he glanced around . His brows lifted at my dark look and he stuck his head inside the gap in the sliding glass door . " What ? " " I 'm talking to Marta Cornell about the Purcells . " " They pay well , darlin ' , and that 's the only goddamn good thing about ' em . " He went back to the sunshine , turning his face skyward like a sybarite . Marta persisted , " Our client wants you to meet him at Foster 's around four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free food . I 'm a sucker for it and Marta knows my weakness . And Foster 's On The Lake is just about my favorite restaurant in the whole world . I seesawed , thinking I might be getting into something I really should n't . In the end , I agreed to go . How bad could the Purcells be ? Two hours later I found a parking spot about a block from Foster 's On The Lake-no small feat-then walked through the restaurant to the back patio , snagging a table beneath one of the plastic , faux-grass umbrellas that sported a commanding view of Lake Chinook . Most of the umbrellas are green canvas , but sometimes Jeff Foster , owner and manager of Foster 's On The Lake , adds a bit of fun to the mix , hence the plastic-party-ones . He did n't notice my arrival or he would have steered me toward a less well-placed table . He knows how cheap I am and tries to give the paying customers the best seats . I was all ready to explain that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wait staff I did n't know let me choose my table . Maybe it was because I 'd taken a little extra care with my appearance . I 'd unsnapped my ponytail , brushed and briefly hot-curled my hair , tossed on a tan , loosely flowing skirt and black tank top . I 'd even done the mascara/eyeliner bit , topping the whole look off with some frosted lip gloss . The Binkster , my pug , had cocked her head at me and slowly wagged her tail . I took this to mean I looked hot . I 'd forgotten to ask Marta what Jasper looked like . He was a Purcell and the Purcells were wealthy and notorious , so apparently that was supposed to be enough . From my research I knew he was in his mid-thirties . I settled back and ordered a Sparkling Cyanide , my new favorite drink , a bright blue martini that draws envious eyes from the people who 've ordered your basic rum and Cokes . I was sipping away when a man in the right age bracket strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I nearly dropped my cocktail . I say nearly , because I 'd paid a whopping eight bucks for it and I was n't going to lose one drop unless Mt . St. Helen 's erupted again and spewed ash and lava to rain down on Foster 's patio , sending us all diving for cover . Even then I might be able to balance it . I felt my lips part . Marta must have guessed what my reaction would be when I clapped eyes on him . She probably was fighting back a huge hardy-har-har all the while we were on the phone . This guy was flat-out gorgeous . Women seated around me took notice : smoothing their hair , sitting up straighter , looking interested and attentive . His gaze settled on me . I gulped against a dry throat . He had it all . Movie star good looks . Electric blue eyes and thick lashes . Chiseled jaw . Smooth , naturally dark skin and blinding white teeth . And a strong physique-taut and muscular with that kind of sinewy grace that belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn out badly . I should have heard the " too handsome " alarm clang in my brain . But , honestly , I just stared . He flashed me a smile , then scraped back the chair opposite me . The sun 's rays sent a shaft of gold light over his left arm . His gray shirt was one of those suede-ish fabrics that moves like a second skin . " Jane Kelly ? " he asked . Great voice . Warm and mellow . He smelled good , too . Musky and citrusy at the same time . And his dark hair had the faintest , and I mean faintest , of an auburn tint , a shade women pay big , big , HUGE , bucks for . I nodded , wondering if I should check for drool on my chin . You can never be too careful . " I 'm Jasper Purcell . " " Hello . " " Thanks for meeting me . I know I did n't give you a lot of time . " I cleared my throat . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your family . She was n't specific . " " I was n't specific with her . " He hesitated , his eyes squinting a bit as if he were wrestling with confiding in me . After a moment , he said , " It 's about my grandmother , Orchid Purcell . " I looked interested , waiting for him to continue . " She named all her girls after flowers . But it 's the only crazy thing she 's done until now . " Mental illness runs in the Purcell family .... " What 's happened ? " I asked cautiously , but Jasper Purcell did n't answer me . He appeared to be lost to some inner world . Eventually he surfaced , glancing around , seeming to notice his surroundings for the first time . " Nice place . I 've never been here . " Since Foster 's was a Lake Chinook institution I was kind of surprised . The Dunthorpe area-where the Purcell mansion had been for the last century-was just north of the lake . If Jasper Purcell grew up there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I help you , Mr. Purcell ? " " Sorry . " He leaned across the table and shook my hand . The heat of his fingers ran right up my arm . I was dazzled by that incredible face so close to mine . " Call me Jazz . " " Jazz ? " " Short for Jasper . My cousin Cammie could never pronounce it . " Nowhere in my research had anything been said about this man 's extraordinary good looks . Was Cammie as beautiful as Jasper-Jazz-was handsome ? I made a mental note to ask Dwayne . Instinctively , I knew I should stay out of whatever he had in store for me . But I really wanted to help him . Really , really wanted to help him . Call it temporary insanity . But every cell in my body seemed to be magnetically attracted to him . ( Continues ... )
