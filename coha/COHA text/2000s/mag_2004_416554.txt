/Jan 2005 It 's an unexpected recipe for preschool fun : Take two preschoolers ( say , Tanner and Carson Loeppky , then aged five and almost three ) . Get a long , flat Rubbermaid bin , about 10 cm ( 4 in. ) deep . Fill it with birdseed . Add toy trucks , tractors , measuring cups , spoons , funnels and anything else you have handy . Let them enjoy it for the next two years . ( By then , new baby Madison will be ready to join in as well . ) " I filled it with puffed wheat for variety sometimes , " adds their mom , Lisa Loeppky , " but the birdseed is great because it is easy to sweep or vacuum up when it gets on the floor . Tanner even liked cleaning it up himself with one of those hand-held vacs . This brought many more hours of enjoyment than any toy we ever bought . " It is one of the nice things about preschoolers : They do n't care about the price tag , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs for preschoolers do n't fit your budget , you might be searching for some economical activities to keep your little folks entertained . Search no more . CHEAP STUFF TO DO AT HOME If the weather 's unbearable for outings , here are some inexpensive , fun things to do at home : * Make crayon rubbings by putting a piece of plain white paper over one or more objects ( leaves , some coins , your keys , textured fabric , buttons ) and rubbing a crayon over them . Preschoolers love seeing the pattern magically appear ! * Darken the room ( hey , this time of year that will happen pretty early ! ) and turn on one lamp or use a flashlight . Show your preschooler how you make shadow puppets with your hands - and let him create some too . * For another kind of hand puppet , show your child how to make a fist with fingers tucked in and thumb curled around the fingers . Use washable markers or makeup to draw a mouth so that the bottom lip is along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; add two eyes up towards the knuckle . Your child can wiggle her thumb to make the puppet " talk . " * Keep an eye out for an old turntable at garage sales ( or check with Grandma and Grandpa ) . Cut circles of paper to fit , push the paper over the spindle in the middle of the turntable , and start it rotating . For three-year-olds , give them washable markers to hold against the paper and make neat spiral designs . A five-year-old might like to drip paint onto the paper from a squeeze bottle or paintbrush. * If you have an old mattress , put it in the basement or playroom and let the children be " monkeys jumping on the bed " to their hearts " content . Much safer than a trampoline ! * Gather up all your junk mail and either let your child cut out the pictures , or , for younger children , cut the flyers up yourself . Many direct mail advertising campaigns have stickers or stamps in them too . Then let your child make collages with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphones , put on a favourite CD , and everybody sings and dances . Preschoolers love to see their parents let loose and be silly ! HEADING OUT * Try mall walking . Many malls are open for an hour or two in the morning before the stores actually open . This is a great time to take preschoolers with you for some exercise in heated comfort , not to mention ideal window shopping - the stores are closed , so kids ca n't disappear into one , dismantle the displays or beg you to buy them things . ( OK , they may still beg - but at least you can point out that the stores are closed. ) * Feed the birds . Scoop a little bird-seed from your Rubbermaid bin into a container to bring with you and take a wintry walk in the park . If you scatter some seed on the ground , you should soon have some feathered visitors to entertain your preschooler. * Tour the fire or police station . Policies vary in different communities , so call in advance ; many stations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit . In some places , there may be a minimum group size , but you can usually find a few friends interested in joining you - or you may be able to tag along with another group doing an official tour . It 's also a great way to teach preschoolers that firefighters and police officers are their helpers . * Call city hall or parks and recreation to ask about other tours or places that welcome visitors . For example , my children loved visiting the filtration plant and learning how sewage is dealt with . Or tour a municipal greenhouse ; it 's like a tropical vacation on an otherwise cold day . * A trip to a store that matches your child 's current interests can be a fun outing - consider the nearest John Deere outlet for a kid who loves tractors and digging machines , or a pet store to visit the fish and budgies for your little animal lover . * Enjoy public transportation - take a bus or subway ride , even if you just end up back where you started . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest outing or homegrown activity can be exciting . " It 's these inexpensive things that encourage their creativity , " adds Loeppky . And dreaming them up encourages parents to be creative too . <p>
