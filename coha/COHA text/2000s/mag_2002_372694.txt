Eighty-six percent of moms think they do n't get enough RESPECT , according to a poll by Family Circle magazine . And 80% agree that moms who STAY HOME get even less . Even so , 77% of mothers who work full time would rather stay home if they could . Moms in both camps are a bit defensive : 73% of those at home think WORKING moms look down on them , and 66% of those who work feel the same way about moms who are at home .
