" Lush Hour , at last ! " Polly Pepper exclaimed as she stepped out of her Manolo Blahnik heels and joined her son , Tim , on the sofa in the great room of Pepper Plantation , her fabled Bel Air mansion . Polly rested her bare feet on his lap , anticipating Tim 's large , strong hands to knead away her aching arches . " I plan my life around this time of day ! " <p> " For the massage ? Or the bubbly ? " <p> " Both make me tingle , dear , " Polly said , wiggling her toes . <p> At the wet bar , Placenta popped the cork from the chilled bottle of Veuve Clicquot . <p> " Pavarotti 's high C never sounded as intoxicating ! " Polly called out as she watched her maid fill three Waterford crystal champagne flutes and sighed as her son gripped her instep . " This is heaven . We can all sit back , take a few dainty sips of God 's golden cure-all , and wash the world away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect , " Placenta said as she handed chilled glasses to Polly and Tim . <p> Polly raised her flute and clinked it against Tim 's and Placenta 's . " I 'm the luckiest star in the universe , " she trilled . She drained her flute in one long swallow . With a satisfied " Ahhhh , " she withdrew her feet from Tim 's lap and leaned forward to reach a slice of Placenta 's famous salmon tortilla appetizer on the glass-top coffee table . At the same time , Placenta refilled her employer 's vessel up to its lipstick-smudged rim . <p> " Yum ! " Polly said , acknowledging both the refill and the salmon tortilla . Then she groaned . " Guess which of the crazies in my life called today ? " <p> " Who is ... Alex Trebek ? " Tim played along . <p> " J.J. Ol ' reptile-eyes himself . " <p> Tim groaned at his mother 's reference to her unctuous agent , J. J. Norton . " I suppose he wants a character reference for one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Believe it or not , he actually has a job for me , " Polly said . <p> " A healing purple pill commercial ? " Tim mocked . <p> " I should be so lucky ! Old stars hawking pharmaceuticals is all the rage . Dorothy Hamill made a **26;677;TOOLONG for Vioxx ! Kathleen Turner , Lauren Bacall , Delta Burke , Peggy Fleming , who has n't made a few million sheckles pushing drugs ? Do n't get me started about Bob Dole 's erectile dysfunction pill ! " <p> Polly , Tim , and Placenta simultaneously shuddered . <p> " As a matter of fact , I 'm up for a reality series , " Polly said . " I 'd be perfect . " <p> Tim coughed in midsip . " Perfect for what ? ' The Biggest Boozer ' ? " <p> Polly winced . " I 'd never diminish my dignity by appearing as a contestant , for crying out loud ! No , there 's a spot open for the ' nice ' judge on a summer replacement talent show . Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FYI " - she glared at Tim- " I 'm totally aware of the ten warning signs of alcoholism . I only have ... " She made a mental tabulation , stuck her tongue out at her son , then took a defiant swallow from her glass . <p> Placenta cackled . " The ' nice ' judge , eh ? Do n't get me wrong , take away dear dead Cyd Charisse , and you and Carol Burnett and Betty White are in a three-way tie for everybody 's idea of the nicest living showbiz legend . But when it comes to faking praise about others ' lack of talent , you 're more like Kelly Ripa feigning devotion to some flash in the pan 's latest CD . You 're both transparent . " <p> Polly looked concerned . <p> " Actually , this could be an ideal job , " Placenta continued , " if you do n't mind lying to poor young wannabes , telling them that they have the potential to achieve fame and fortune , when in fact they stink . " <p> " Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moldy bath mats , one does n't require talent to succeed in show business , " Polly sniffed . " Just look at Charlie Sheen . " <p> " Just look at your bath mats ! " Placenta snapped . <p> " So what 's the show about ? " Tim asked . " Dating ? " <p> " Home makeovers ? " Placenta added . <p> " Extreme retribution in the workplace ? " <p> " Celebrity colon irrigation ? " <p> Polly thought for a moment . She shrugged . " They sing . They dance . They swallow scorpions . Who knows ? Who cares ? Just cheap thrills for a viewing audience weary from news of wars , the sucky economy , melting ice caps , and Naomi Campbell 's latest assault and battery charges against her domestics . But it pays well , and it 's only for the summer . It 's called , um , I 'll Do Anything to Become Famous . " <p> Placenta rolled her eyes . " Accent on the word anything , I suppose . I swear I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of talent to millions of television viewers . Frankly , I 'm embarrassed for them . They 're too stupid to realize they 're practically wearing ' Kick Me ' signs ! " <p> Tim nodded in agreement . " At least you 'll have a summer job that does n't include steaming July nights at an amphitheater in St. Louis ! Fans may miss seeing you in perspiration soaked Victorian gowns and wigs playing The King and I , but we 'll all be safe and sound in an air-conditioned television studio . " <p> " God knows , it 's easy money , " Polly said . " I mean , how much work can it be to sit around and watch telegenic amateurs , and telling ' em how delightful they are ? " <p> At the thought of being around attractive contestants , Tim became animated . " I 'm very compassionate toward losers . I may have to help comfort more than a few cute dancers or singers or sword swallowers . I 'll be indispensable in helping to restore their self-worth ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hollywood 's ne'er-do-wells , " Polly paused . " Actually , I have a rather good feeling about this job . That is , if I accept it . I still have n't decided . There are always negotiations to hammer out . Billing . Per Diem . Expense account . You know J.J. , and his penchant for getting me involved in crummy projects . Lately they 've been murder ! " <p> " A primetime program could give your career another leg up , " Placenta advised . " That Dancing with Pseudo Stars sure helped bring Marie Osmond back-for a minute . And the previously unknown judges on that show are now household names . " <p> " Very well , I 'll do it ! " Polly announced . " These programs are the closest we 'll ever get to good old-fashioned variety shows . But if I 'm the ' nice ' judge , I 'm a little concerned about who I 'll be sparring against . You know how much I loathe confrontation . I could n't handle a Simon Cowell clone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an opinion , you do n't let go until everybody agrees with you ! " Tim sassed . " You 're still insisting that the last Indiana Jones flick was a masterpiece ! And that 's only because you think Harrison Ford is still hot . Which he is . " <p> Placenta added , " Your pigheadedness is why Jamie Lee Curtis wo n't play Scrabble with you anymore . There 's no such word as glurge ! " <p> The great room was quiet for a long moment . Polly , Tim , and Placenta thought about the phenomenon known as " reality shows . " With the airing of every new program , Z-list celebrities were instantly created . They achieved quickly fleeting fame for doing things as brainless as dating a dweeb or having Tyra Banks judge how well they performed bikini waxes . <p> Will my conscience allow me to encourage vain acts of hedonism such as fashion and grooming ? Polly thought . <p> Polly Pepper sparring with cranky judges is likely to make the show a watercooler hit ! Placenta considered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into one of the studs from Dancing with the Stars , Tim day-dreamed . <p> Their reverie was shattered by the sound of the telephone ringing . " Oh , let the machine pick up , " Polly moaned . " I 'm not in the mood to negotiate with J.J. " <p> The trio listened . " Honeybabycookiesweetie ! It 's Phil . Just heard about your new job offer ! Listen . I 'm awaiting a new trial . I suppose you 've heard about that dead wannabe actress playing with my shotgun . Nobody believes that she was cleaning it ... with her tongue . I 'm a rotten judge of women , but I still have a darn good sixth sense about talent . So if you decide not to do the show , please put in a word for me . Ciao , bella ! " <p> " Oh Lord , " Polly snorted . " Next we 'll be hearing from Bobby Blake ! " <p> Again , the telephone rang . <p> As the elevator doors opened onto the foyer of J. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang in her powerful imitation of Ethel Merman , " There 's no business like show business ... ! " With Tim and Placenta in tow , she confidently walked across the blond hardwood floor to the reception desk . " You 're new . " She smiled at a young man wearing tortoiseshell eyeglasses , a white oxford cloth button-down dress shirt , and a conservative striped tie . <p> He was startled by Polly 's sudden appearance . <p> " This place is like Oz , " Polly said . " People come and go so quickly here . " <p> " My agency offered me combat pay if I could last until Friday , " the receptionist admitted . <p> Polly reached out and caressed the young man 's smooth cheek with her hand . " Poor baby , " she cooed . " J.J. can be a beast . The only way for a boy of your angelic beauty to survive is to ... Well , never mind . You 're safe as long as you sneeze a lot . " <p> " And make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Placenta added . <p> Polly turned to Tim . " Do n't you think so too , dear ? Is n't he adorable ? " <p> " Absolutely , " Tim said , appraising their host . <p> " What 's your name , dear ? " Polly asked , holding out her hand to shake . <p> " I 'm not supposed to give out my name or become friendly with clients , " the young man said , looking around to make sure that he was n't being observed interacting with guests . " Mr. Norton is very strict . I had to sign a confidentiality agreement and swear that when I leave each day I 'll forget all the celebrities who may have come to the office . " <p> Polly rolled her eyes . " One can never forget moi , dear , " she said . " As you know , I'm- " <p> " Polly Pepper ! " the receptionist said . <p> " He 's smart , too ! " Polly said , looking at Tim . " This pet you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Mr. Norton described you , " the receptionist said . <p> Polly blanched . <p> " Take a deep breath , " Placenta coaxed , as she patted Polly on the back . " Reel yourself in , honey . Do n't succumb to J.J. bashing in public . " <p> Polly found the breath to speak . " Where is dear Mr. Congeniality , anyway ? We have a luncheon appointment . " <p> " He had an emergency meeting with a potential new client , " the receptionist said . <p> " Potential ? " Placenta tsk-tsked . <p> " The Best Western down the street again ? " Tim sniggered . <p> " His usual room ? " Polly suggested . <p> " Mr. Norton wanted me to personally hand this envelope to you , " the receptionist said . <p> " J.J. did n't have the decency to call before I had to battle midday traffic to get here , " Polly said , trying not to sound too perturbed . " What 's in the package ? " <p> Everybody watched as Polly opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script . " I 'll Do Anything to Become Famous , " she read from the cover page . " I thought these programs were n't scripted . " Polly flipped through the pages and discovered that it was a breakdown of the show , complete with bios of the contestants and judges . There were suggested words and body language to use when evaluating a particularly pitiful performance . Polly looked aghast . " I ca n't say such things to those poor sweet and probably embarrassed innocents . " <p> The receptionist looked around the foyer again for eavesdroppers . " I could get fired on the spot for this . But since I Googled you this morning and remembered you 're the star my grandparents used to love , I 'll take a chance . " <p> " Grandparents ? " Polly raised an eyebrow . " How old are you ? " She and Tim and Placenta leaned in closer as the receptionist whispered , " If it 's any indication of what you 're in for , the FBI used the casting call as a sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a whole lot of criminals who responded to the Craigslist ad that called for contestants who would be willing to do anything , and it stressed anything , to become famous . Also , the six who were selected had to go through a mental evaluation to make sure they are n't dangerous to the judges . " <p> Polly swallowed hard . She then straightened her posture , squared her shoulders , and pasted a smile on her face . " Sweetums , the moment that Mr. Norton returns from his emergency mating , would you please tell him to ring me ? Contract or not , there are still a few things to hammer out . It was lovely meeting you . Good luck with your combat pay . " <p> As Polly turned to leave , the receptionist called out , " Please do n't tell Mr. Norton that I spoke to you ! " <p> " My lips are sealed . And tell your grandparents that Polly Pepper sends kisses . " <p> " They 're dead . " <p> " That happens a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped in and Tim pushed the button for subterranean parking . As they dropped through the shaft , Polly clutched the show material to her chest and silently stared at the digital readout as they passed each floor . It was only when Tim was driving his mother 's Park Ward Rolls-Royce down Sunset Boulevard toward Beverly Hills , with Polly and Placenta buckled into their seats behind him , that Polly emerged from her silence . She retrieved the synopsis of the show and began to read aloud : <p> " ' A fusion of American Idol , Celebrity Detox , and The Miss America Pageant , I 'll Do Anything to Become Famous is a high-octane laser light show of a talent competition program with one major difference from others in this genre glut . While contestants are encouraged to give the best artistic performance , they also have to convince the judges and the voting television viewing audience that they understand that talent is n't enough . To be a success in Hollywood , one must be as nefarious as Glenn Close on Damages . They 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything - in order to become the next Dina Lohan , Denise Richards , or the Geiko gecko . <p> " ' When each week 's remaining wannabes reach the interview segment of the program , the judges pose Truth or Dare - like questions about celebrity ethics and morality . The answers and the lengths to which each contender says he/she would go to become a star will help decide the ultimate winner . ' <p> " My stars ! " Polly sighed . " This is America 's Got Talent for the Menendez brothers ! " <p> Tim looked back at his mother through the rearview mirror . She was lost in a fog of thought . Then he looked at Placenta , who was beaming . " Why the smile ? " Tim asked . <p> " ' Cause this show is going to be a hit ! " Placenta said . " Who wants to see boring singers and dancers with nothing more on their mind other than emulating whoever is on top at the moment ? This show 'll give the public a look at how mean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every looky-loo loves a train wreck ! " <p> " It 'll be a lot harder to be the ' nice ' judge if the contestants are undisciplined thugs , " Polly countered . " I do n't want to jeopardize my public 's opinion of me ! I ca n't let happen to me what happened to Bing Crosby 's widow . One appearance on Johnny Carson and poof , she was instantly recognized as not so grieving . " <p> " Who are the contestants ? " Tim asked . <p> Polly riffled through the papers for the bios . " These are more like personality evaluations . Yikes ! Listen to this : ' Ped-Xing : A surly self-absorbed rapper thug . Short on vocal agility but long on intimidation . Observed during auditions bullying others and sharing body-piercing horror stories . A-plus among the three thousand applicants . ' " <p> Placenta cackled . " Would one call him ' Ped ' or ' Mr. Xing ' ? I 'll never understand the crazy names these so-called artists make up for themselves ! ' 50 Cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " ' Amy Stout ' , " Polly continued . " ' A Miley Cyrus clone . Southern drawl that comes and goes like the color of a mood ring . Has at least two faces : Ellen DeGeneres fun , and Lily Tomlin caught in an I Heart Huckabees soundstage snit , when she does n't get her way . Disingenuous , but has a lovely voice . ' <p> " Another A-plus score , " Polly noted . " And how rude of them to bring up my darling Lily 's little diatribe on that movie set . She would n't have been so nasty if she 'd known that some meany was videotaping her tantrum for an axe-grinding broadcast . Poor baby ! " <p> Tim smiled . " She 's always been nice to me . But I still have fun watching her meltdown ! Pretty scary stuff . Like Bill O'Reilly ! " <p> " Who are the other Antichrists on the show ? " Placenta asked . <p> " Um , let 's see . Oh , here 's one . Miranda Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Finally , someone with talent ! " Polly read on . " ' Contestant is more likely to become a maximum-sec <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
