THE CAFETERIA SUPERVISING JOB description sounded simple : Make sure the children are safe and happy , encourage them to eat nutritiously so they 're prepared to learn in the afternoon , promote good manners and consideration of fellow students , and try to keep the noise level down - a little . I decided to give it a try after several years of volunteering in my children 's classrooms , with the added incentive that this particular job was a paid position . My youngest was starting full-time in grade one , so working in the lunchroom from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. let me stay in touch with the school environment while still being home to send my kids off in the morning and meet them at the bus at the end of the day . On my first day I dressed to impress , and one of the veteran lunch ladies looked me up and down and said , " Two pieces of advice : Wear closed-toe I shoes and never wear anything you 'd mind having someone throw up on . " *&gt; Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ice cream between my toes when I left that day and , although no one had thrown up on me , I did have pizza sauce up one sleeve , as well as little smudgy handprints on the back of my crisp white shirt where I 'd been enthusiastically hugged . And my ears were ringing . Elementary school students have about half an hour to eat . This is much too long for most children , who eat in about 10 minutes and spend the rest of the time yelling to their friends across the room , tattling on their table mates and asking to go to the bathroom . Their teachers , though , need that *half-hour to eat , pee , breathe and take a few Aspirin . So my colleagues and I take over : policing the bullies , cleaning up juice spills and encouraging everyone to eat their fruit before their dessert . Some kids take longer than others to eat , though , and if they 're not done by the end of the half-hour , we always tell them to take home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to show their mom or dad exactly how much lunch they ate . There are the kids who come in with a big smile and a hug for the lunch ladies . There are many who run for a seat at the table , anxious to " get the seat I want next to the friend I want across from the kid in the other class who always has Doritos and shares with me , " as one boy explained breathlessly . Some ( especially the little ones at the beginning of the year ) enter sobbing , holding their teacher 's hand , afraid to venture into the noisy , confusing , cavernous room that 's just so different from lunch with Mom in their quiet kitchen at home . We try to do our best for each of them , and most of those situations are easy to handle with patience , a quick hug or a firm " Hey , you in the yellow shirt ! Walk ! " A lot of being a lunch lady is just being a mom - distracting the child afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making sure a reluctant eater manages at least a sip of milk , a cracker and some fruit . There was one little girl who would drink her milk , but never open her lunch box . I tried to get her to eat by asking , " What did Mom or Dad make you for lunch today ? I bet it 's really yummy ! Why do n't you show me ? " whereupon the girl sitting next to her shouted out , " She does n't have a mom ! She died ! Her dad makes stinky lunches ! " This was a heart-wrenching moment for me , but not for the girl , who defended her dad 's lunch-making abilities and proved it by opening her lunch box and eating everything inside . Some students spontaneously confide their innermost secrets and worries to me at the strangest times : As I helped a little guy open one of those annoying hermetically sealed Lunchables , he said , " Guess what ? My dad 's in jail ! Want to know why ? " Another boy , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , whispered , " I have a dog like that and her name 's Lucy , but she got hit by a car yesterday and we took her to the vet , but I think she 's not going to get better " and started to cry . I 'm often at a loss as to how to deal with those kind of confidences , so I fall back on a compassionate and hopefully comforting ( but I fear woefully inadequate ) " I 'm sure things will be better soon , sweetie . " There 's the girl with the new lunch box or the boy with the new glasses who ca n't wait to show them off : Their joy over such small things is infectious . I feel proud ( and so do they ) when I can teach them the best way to open those pesky milk cartons . When there 's a short break in the action , I sit down with them at those little tables , and they tell me really bad jokes or show me the note their mom wrote them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and I make them giggle by doing quadruple knots on them . Lunch is a great time for children , after being in class all morning , to decompress , talk with their friends , giggle and , hopefully , eat . No matter how strange the lunchroom seems to children at the beginning of the school year , by the end of June when I ask , " What 's your favourite subject ? " they always answer , " Lunch ! "
