Section : Nation &; World <p> Had history gone as planned , Donald Rumsfeld would have spent the week talking about his vision for the military of the 21st century . The " Quadrennial Defense Review , " to be delivered to Congress this week , was to be the culmination of eight months of intense deliberation over one of President Bush 's top priorities  --  transforming America 's military from a lumbering Cold War behemoth into the world 's most high-tech , highly mobile fighting force . Instead , the vagaries of history have sent Rumsfeld 's Pentagon hurtling in new and unpredictable directions . As America launches its unprecedented war against international terrorism , the Pentagon must suddenly walk the walk , not just talk the talk . Rumsfeld 's defense review waxes expansively about the need to prepare for " asymmetric warfare " by enemies intent on attacking America 's weaknesses , not its strengths . But with America now reeling , its military leaders are struggling for an appropriate  --  and effective  --  response . <p> Even as President Bush mounts a traditional show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandos toward Afghanistan  --  administration officials have backed away from earlier suggestions of swift , massive military retribution . And just as it is not beginning in conventional fashion , this most unconventional conflict is unlikely to conclude with the kind of clear-cut victory seen with the surrender of Japan on Sept. 2 , 1945 . " Needless to say , there 's not going to be a D-Day as such , " Rumsfeld announced last week . " And I 'm sure there will not be a signing ceremony on the Missouri . " <p> " Wake-up call . " The Pentagon , at least , has marshaled the words to begin describing this new kind of combat . Asymmetric warfare is " unanticipated or nontraditional approaches to circumvent or undermine an adversary 's strengths while exploiting his vulnerabilities through unexpected technologies or innovative means , " according to one Pentagon publication . More simply put : It is dirty fighting that gives the weak the best chance to defeat the strong . In carrying out the September 11 attacks , Osama bin Laden and his operatives employed the strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that people have no interest in playing to our strong suits , " says Andrew Krepinevich of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , a defense think tank . " They do n't have any incentive to take us on tank on tank , fighter plane on fighter plane . " <p> The war against them , consequently , will lack many of the features of the air war against Serbia in 1999 or the massive deployments of ground troops in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 . There will be some similarities , of course . Special-operations forces , both American and British , are already reported to be carrying out missions in Afghanistan . But the front lines of this new war will shift from the precipitous defiles of that rugged , perpetually ungovernable nation to the secretive foreign banks that hold bin Laden 's cash to the cloistered halls of diplomacy and the intelligence services . <p> The diplomatic front has already seen early successes . President Bush has won the support of dozens of nations , including Russia and Saudi Arabia , and isolated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News has learned that the Pentagon is planning operations to get food and other supplies to fleeing Afghan civilians to show that this is a war against terrorists  --  not Muslims . <p> One aspect of the war that is chillingly unique is the fact that it began , and may continue , at home . In the end  --  if it is ever recognized as such  --  civilian deaths , including those from the September 11 attacks , will very likely outnumber those of combatants . In the words of Peter Probst , a recently retired Pentagon adviser on terrorism , " This is not a war that can be won by an impatient people . " <p> In one sense , asymmetric warfare is as old as warfare itself . " One should offer the enemy a bait to lure him ; feign disorder and strike him , " wrote Chinese strategist Sun Tzu in The Art of War more than 2,000 years ago . " Where he is strong , avoid him . " In modern times , asymmetric attacks have proven wildly successful , no doubt encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed 241 U.S. service members led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region . In 1993 , Somali militiamen downed two U.S. helicopters and killed 18 American troops . Though the Somalis lost hundreds of their own in the battle , the stunning reports of dead Americans in a land of little strategic importance completely undercut political support for U.S. presence there . Soon after , the United States packed up and headed home . <p> Yet only in the past five years have military planners isolated asymmetric warfare as a discrete military strategy , akin to guerrilla warfare or urban combat . " It finally dawned on people , " says Steven Metz , a professor at the Army War College in Carlisle , Pa. , " that we were n't going to face anyone as stupid as Saddam Hussein in the future . " As a result , the Army and Marine Corps have stepped up training for urban combat , where close fighting and the presence of civilians tend to neutralize U.S. technology and firepower advantages . Pentagon war games now study what would happen if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the key technologies that make them effective : intelligence and communications satellites , the Global Positioning System , computers , and other electronics . <p> These exercises highlight the difficulties . In 1997 , the Army War College conducted a war game setting the United States against a diffuse rebel organization without centralized authority , similar to bin Laden 's al Qaeda network . The Army became frustrated as it used overwhelming force to strike one of the enemy sites , only to see the organization sprout another head elsewhere . " At the end of the game , the insurgency had been battered but still existed , " explains Metz , who helped coordinate the game . " Any insurgency that lives to fight another day has won a sort of victory . " <p> Yet clever asymmetric tactics still hamper U.S. military operations . During the 1999 air war over Serbia , for instance , Serbian air defense gunners continually frustrated U.S. and allied air forces by , of all things , refusing to turn on their air defense radars or fire their surface-to-air missiles . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant they had to constantly protect themselves against attack by flying at high altitudes that made it hard to spot Serbian forces on the ground and other key targets . In a couple of dramatic cases , highflying U.S. pilots mistakenly killed refugees instead of combatants , which sapped international support for the war . <p> Isolate and strike . This time , war planners are struggling to craft their own asymmetric strategies to exploit bin Laden 's weaknesses . One of those weaknesses is his increasing isolation , even from his extremist Taliban " hosts , " who are now stuck harboring the world 's most wanted man . Some strategists suggest that instead of mounting a military campaign to root out the master terrorist , the U.S.-led alliance could quietly work to create a rift between bin Laden and the Taliban . A combination of intense diplomatic pressure , threatened or actual military attacks , and financial or political inducements could persuade the Taliban to cough up bin Laden 's whereabouts . Then , crack military units on high alert nearby could sweep in for an attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1,000 to 2,000 of the best-trained fighters in Afghanistan , would ensure it was not a rout . <p> At the same time , the government must devote more resources to defending U.S. cities and towns that have become the new front line of this war . The commission on homeland defense being chaired by Vice President Dick Cheney is considering a broad range of measures to prepare for future attacks on U.S. soil . They include stockpiling vaccines against biological scourges like smallpox and anthrax , putting chemical detectors in subways and other crowded areas , setting up air defense weapons around nuclear power plants , and securing rail lines and trucking facilities used to transport chemicals and other hazardous materials . Those ideas are n't new . Over the last few years , " everybody was pointing at the threat , " says Michele Flournoy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Pentagon policymaker during the 1990s . " But nobody was willing to put resources at it . " Now , she says , the challenge is to prioritize missions that fall to numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arise when budgets and missions are reassessed . <p> The role of intelligence gathering will be a key asymmetric advantage of the United States  --  if the CIA can revamp its tactics and get a window into bin Laden 's organization . Unlike during the Gulf War , satellites high overhead will be of limited use to find an enemy huddling in caves and other hide-outs scattered around the rugged terrain of Afghanistan . Consequently , the CIA will have a different mission than during previous conflicts . The fanaticism and dedication of bin Laden 's operatives make traditional recruiting of spies nearly impossible . Veteran agents say that a spy would likely have to participate in terrorist attacks to earn the trust of al Qaeda insiders . " Until you use a different kind of agent , you 're not going to penetrate a terrorist group , " says Ted Price , a former deputy director of operations at the CIA . " It would require too high a price . " Instead , they will be targeting the support personnel and possibly Afghans who put themselves at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dearth of skilled linguists and agents with appropriate cultural backgrounds . " I think there is this simplistic notion that we dress people up as Afghans , teach them the language , and then penetrate " al Qaeda , says John Gannon , former head of the National Intelligence Council . <p> Local knowledge . Instead , the CIA will rely on the cooperation of foreign intelligence agencies , who have always provided the most useful information on groups like al Qaeda . The single most important group will be Pakistan 's intelligence agency , the Inter Services Intelligence . Given Pakistan 's close relationship to the Taliban ( it is currently the only government with diplomatic ties to Kabul ) , Pakistan has by far the best intelligence on bin Laden and his protectors in the Taliban . The United States will also rely heavily on international law enforcement , which has for several years been hunting down bin Laden 's organization . According to a former Pentagon official , bin Laden 's operatives " have been wrapped up dozens and dozens of times , in all four corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , it was local security agents , not the U.S. military , that lowered the hammer . And with little resistance . " Usually you 'd hit them at a hotel , and the guy would be sitting in his underwear with a laptop , " says the official . <p> Rumsfeld 's long-awaited defense review attempts to address some areas where U.S. forces may be unprepared for asymmetric warfare . U.S. News has learned that it urges the Air Force to develop more long-range bombers that do n't depend on air bases close to the front , which could easily be attacked by missiles bearing chemical or biological agents . It endorses the idea of a new submarine that would be packed with more than 150 cruise missiles , allowing it to bring massive firepower close to the shores of adversaries . <p> The review also prompts the Army to accelerate plans to field new divisions that can move rapidly and discreetly across a battlefield , instead of marshaling huge trains of armor and logistics . And Rumsfeld intends to permanently shift naval forces from traditional theaters like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in the vicinity of China , North Korea , India , and other growing regional powers . The review has already drawn fire from military officials and defense experts , who lament that the document falls far short of the bold promises President Bush made during the presidential campaign . <p> Yet the peacetime battles that surround military budgets and strategy now seem petty , as the Pentagon stands united in dealing with the task at hand . Ultimately , success may depend on whether the military can recognize and embrace the new face of battle . It was able to do so in 1941 , when a surprise attack thrust the United States into a war it was at the time ill-equipped to fight . Sixty years later , an anxious nation hopes the military , once again , is up to the task .
