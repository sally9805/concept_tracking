Young Africans share their ideas for a better future for the continent . // A project to explore " hopes , fears , ambitions , and goals of young dynamic Africans , " has culminated in a new book published by the Nordic Africa Institute , African Voices , African Visions . The purpose of the project was to generate new ideas about the future and to get the younger generation of Africa 's intellectual leaders to think about the unthinkable  --  Africa 's long-term future . " The value of this project goes beyond this book , " according to the co-editors , Nigerian economists Olugbenga Adesida and Arunma Oteh . " As far as we know , it is the first time that such an effort , which specifically targets young Africans , has been undertaken . " The problems facing Africa are manifold complex , and overlapping , but the 14 contributing authors are unflinching in their battle against " Afro-pessimism . " It is possible that optimism is a necessary condition to think about the long-term future of Africa in the first place ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future should be that we have one ) . But it is also possible that the very exercise of imagining preferred futures generated the optimism to be found in these essays . " The desire for a better future permeated all the essays that we received , " according to Adesida and Oteh . " The authors desire a future that is uniquely African , with a high quality of life and standard of living . " In short , their desire is for " a future full of hope and promise ; a dream for a beautiful future for the coming generations . The overwhelming conclusion is that we , as Africans , can make this happen . " Project coordinator Adesida , founder of the Knowledge Network , a futures think tank and strategic consulting firm , is a professional futurist , but the essayists are drawn from academia , policy analysis , development work , journalism , and other disciplines . What Africans Want The preferred future , the authors seem to agree , is for a free and prosperous Africa . The way to that future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . Above all , solving Africa 's problems is Africa 's responsibility ; blaming the West , blaming colonialism , playing the victim is , the authors suggest , disempowering and counterproductive .

Brighter futures begin with the exercise of envisioning them , believe the young Africans contributing to the African Voices , African Visions project . // Ghanaian policy analyst Godwin Y. Dogbey provides a strategic management approach to understanding the current situation in Africa through a SWOT analysis-strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , and threats see sidebar , " A SWOT Analysis of Africa , " page 46 . Two of the biggest problems Africa faces are political corruption and economic incompetence . But solving these problems is n't simply a matter of applying models of democracy and capitalism developed elsewhere . The " winner-take-all , " majority-rule principle of democracy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , for example , would exacerbate the rich-poor disparities already corroding the African psyche . As Africa transitions from colonialism to democracy , a new politics of exclusion has emerged in places like Nigeria , where the trend has been greater entrenchment of incumbents , notes political scientist Musa LM . Abutudu . The dictatorships that superseded colonial rule were definitely not the future that Africans dreamed of achieving . But a new form of democracy is possible-one that is set in Africa 's multiethnic and multireligious context . This model of democratization depends on decentralization of authority and more local autonomy , Abutudu suggests . " To realize our vision of democracy , African societies must begin to take conscious steps to delegitimize dictatorships , " writes Abutudu . " The tendency of African leaders to defend their gross violations of individual and collective rights by vague and unsubstantiated references to " African Culture " or the peculiar character of the African state must no longer go uncontested . There is nothing in African culture that encourages murders , torture , and incarceration as a basis for governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top , concurs Nigerian student Chika Nwobi , who calls for " admirable leaders " such as South Africa 's Nelson Mandela and Ghana 's Jerry Rawlings- " persons of integrity , committed to serving their nations before themselves . " Integrity at the leadership level will then spread to all of society . As Nwobi puts it : " When the bath water is poured directly on the head , it will trickle or flow down and sanitize the rest of the body . " // DATA BOX FOR AFRICA Photograph Former South African President Nelson Mandela poses with stamp issued in his honor , November 26 , 2001 . Mandela is widely regarded as an " admirable leader " who should serve as a role model for ending political corruption in Africa , according to contributors to African Voices , African Visions . // One way to reduce corruption is through new political rules , such as term limits , open political succession , and even a non-party presidency . Egyptian political science professor Hamdy Abdel Rahman calls for a Swiss consociational model of democracy-consensus rather than " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the grassroots , investing more in education and in what Ugandan economist Barbara Mbire  --  Barungi calls " indigenization " of the economy-i.e. , support for small and micro enterprises at the local level . Human Numbers : Asset or Liability ? Surprisingly little attention is paid by the contributors to rapid population growth as a source of Africa 's ills . The problem is n't overpopulation , the authors seem to feel ; rather , the problems are African agriculture 's inability to feed everyone and the massive migration that overwhelms cities and leaves no one to work the farms . The solution is thus to invest in agricultural development . Humans are a resource , too , to be invested in . The potential of women as economic contributors and political leaders in Africa has gone untapped . Not only must the subjugation of women end , but women 's full potential must be explored if Africa is to fulfill its goals , according to Levi M. Obijiofor , a Nigerian journalist .

However , it is my considered opinion that African male leaders have failed Africa and that women should be given the opportunity to lead the continent out of its predicament , " says Obijiofor . " Equity , justice , and fairness demand that we try women in all areas where men have failed Africa . " Africa in the Global Village With a worldwide economic crisis looming , the more powerful regions ( Europe , Asia , and the Americas ) could turn their backs on Africa ; this could work to Africa 's advantage if it spurs the continent to become more self-reliant , suggests Ghanaian Comfort Lamptey , a program specialist with the UN Development Fund for Women . An important potential source of support from the world community could come from the African Diaspora , Lamptey notes . In one scenario , she writes , " Africans in the Diaspora exercised their responsibilities to the continent through the cultivation of strategic alliances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent and relevant counterpart institutions within Africa . " But the rest of the world must play a role in helping Africa overcome its current problems , says Hamdy Abdel Rahman . " Africa must take its future into its own hands but this does not exclude the importance of external variables and actors . " Among other things , " the West should stop attempting to recolonize Africa by imposing policies and programs that do not take African initiatives into consideration . In this regard , the international community can contribute to ending the marginalization of Africa in various ways by reducing the debts of Africa , encouraging African initiatives that emphasize self-dependence and development , cutting assistance to despotic regimes in Africa , and supporting democratization that ensures genuine public participation . " Editors Adesida and Oteh conclude that the visioning process among all Africans , young and old , is an ongoing and necessary project . They write : " It is only by challenging ourselves , reflecting together , and thinking about the possibilities that we can have the audacity to dream and generate ideas about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no choice except to dream of the impossible , given the fact that almost all predictions paint a gloomy picture of the future of the continent .
