from Chapter FOUR // People of the Book // As we saw in Cairo , and as was also true in Baghdad and Cordoba , the richness of the Jewish library in the medieval Arab world was remarkable . The reader with means collected the books of Maimonides , Galen , Averroes , Claudius Ptolemy , Avicenna , Aristotle , and Hippocrates and arranged them around the Bible or the Talmud . In northern Europe , on the other hand , the shelves were infinitely less laden , but they drew more attention , and with it , hostility . // " Because of the blasphemous allusion to the Savior and the Virgin " that some claimed to see in the library of the Israelites , this collection , and in particular the Talmud , which often formed its unique basis , was the subject of a permanent and almost obsessive hunt . Although the Syrian king Antiochos had started the fad long before , it was a converted Jew named Nicolas Donin who , in 1239 aroused the vigilance of Gregory XI regarding the hellish reading material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a secret circular to the monarchs and prelates of France , England , Spain , and Portugal ordering that during the Sabbath of the next Lent , they were to take advantage of the time when all the Jews were in synagogue to collect all their books and send them to the mendicant brothers for analysis . // On May 15 , 1248 , after a period of time that would give the impression all had been read , the pope condemned Judaic literature and all its horrors . France , however , was not able to bear waiting until his verdict came in : The cremation of fourteen cartloads of books took place on a public square in Paris in 1241 , followed by ten carts another day in 1244 . In 1263 , Clement IV enjoined the king of Aragon and his lords under pain of excommunication to compel the Jews to hand over all their books for examination . In 1299 , it was Philip the Fair who ordered the judges to assist the inquisitors in the holy chore , and another three loads of books were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not left out : Bernardo Gui had two cartloads of confiscated books paraded for several days through the streets of Toulouse before the volumes were taken to be burned . // Thus a kind of papal routine was established : John XXII in 1320 and Alexander V in 1409 and in 1553 Julian III gave strict instructions for all the books from the Jewish shelf to be gone over with a finetoothed comb , with an eye to getting rid of them . These books seem to form a virtual library displayed on the shelves of the centuries with an obstinacy that exacerbated an unvarying impulse to annihilate them . Another twelve thousand books to be burned were found in Cremona in 1569 . It was so extreme , says one author , that it is admirable that the " Talamuz " ( Talmud ) was able to survive such fervor. // This leads to the story of the Reuchlin report . Around 1508 , Pfefferkorn , a Jewish butcher recently baptized by the Dominicans and offered the benefits of a sinecure , took pride in denouncing the horrors studding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither Hebrew nor Latin , his complaint made its way to Emperor Maximilian , who decided to officially pose this question : Should the books of the chosen people be confiscated and destroyed by fire ? He ordered a report from two experts : the high inquisitor of Cologne , whose conclusions may as well have been written in advance , and a law professor , Johannes Reuchlin. // A friend of Erasmus and a good Christian , the humanist Reuchlin had written a Hebrew grammar in 1506 , and , like Marsilio Ficino and Pico dela Mirandola , whose company he also frequented , Reuchlin was a commentator on the kabbalah in which , according to him , lay the base of the true Christian faith . He did not like Jews particularly , but he idolized books  --  and logic . His jurist response entitled Recommendation Whether to Confiscate , Destroy and Burn all Jewish Books marks a red-letter date ( 1510 ) in the history of tolerance . // Reuchlin launches his argument with the observation that the Jews are subjects of the emperor and benefit from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he erases the superstitious murk surrounding their literature by drawing up a complete panorama of it : scriptures , commentaries , treatises of philosophy and the various sciences , then poems , fairy tales , and satires . Perhaps in this final genre , he concedes , any who look for it can find anti-Christian sentiment , but this concerns only one book with " its own title , just as the author imagined it , " and an entire people can not be held responsible for individual expression . // For the rest , Reuchlin appeals to Aristotle and St. Jerome : How can we oppose what we do not understand ? " If someone is taken by an urge to write against mathematicians and he knows nothing of mathematics or even arithmetic , wouldn ? t he make himself the laughing stock of all ? " He then takes his readers into the realm of linguistics and the definition of truth and falseness , then on the dialectic of God , necessarily Hebrew . After this there is what may well be an argument of weight : If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done so centuries ago , for they were much more zealous with regard to matters of Christian faith than we are . // This remarkable defense was one of the first texts to benefit from the stunning novelty of the printing press , and its publicity did not fail to bear fruit : More Israelite books were confiscated and burned and the writings of Reuchlin himself were burned by the Inquisition of Cologne , while he himself escaped death by fire as a heretic only through dying in 1522 . Yet the first assault against general anti-Semitism had been waged . This subtle Recommendation is in fact the first argument which suggests that German law differs from the Catholic law of Rome . One of Reuchlin ? s most attentive readers was named Martin Luther. //
