Abby Barnes ' hand shoots up nearly every time her teacher asks the 19 squirmy first-graders in her suburban Philadelphia public school to match letters of the alphabet to the sounds they make . Sitting up front with her pinchable cheeks framed by long blond hair , Abby , 7 , looks as eager as any of her classmates to blurt out an answer . But every time the teacher calls on her , Abby freezes . Her face tightens . She strains to respond . And even if an answer manages to get past her lips , her words are inaudible . She 's effectively mute throughout the school day  --  even at recess , where the closest she will come to open communication is words whispered to a trusted girlfriend . <P> At home , however , Abby is a different child . She loves to play cards and board games and frolic with her brother Jack , 5 . " She speaks loudly  --  sometimes too loudly  --  and can be bossy toward her brother , " says mother Lisa Barnes , who runs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every other way , a perfectly normal child who has no shortage of extracurricular activities , including horseback-riding lessons and dance classes that she 's been attending since she was 4 . " Performing in public is fine , " says her mother . " She likes people to look at her and applaud . " <P> So why does n't she speak up in class ? What may at first glance look like shyness or obstinacy is actually something far more complex  --  and much more interesting . Abby , like hundreds of thousands of kids across the U.S. , is suffering from a little understood but increasingly recognized childhood disorder called selective mutism . <P> The key to selective mutism , or SM for short , is the seemingly incongruous behavior Abby exhibits : voluble in private , silent in public . According to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-IV , a child who has developed normally at home but has not talked at school or in other social situations for at least a month is a strong candidate for a diagnosis of SM . Experts once believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an influential study three years ago in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry put the prevalence at closer to 7 in 1,000 , making SM almost twice as common as autism . <P> SM can strike at any age , even among children who once talked in public , but it usually becomes obvious by age 3 or 4 , when peers are happily jabbering away . About 30% of kids with SM also have a developmental speech impairment , which can exacerbate the problem but is generally not the cause . In the past doctors often recommended speech therapy , but treating the physical or neurological issues alone will probably have little impact on the underlying psychological factors behind SM . <P> The root of the problem in most cases is an extreme form of social anxiety or phobia . " It is a fear that can literally make it impossible to speak , " says Dr. Elisa Shipon- Blum , a Philadelphia-based clinician who specializes in treating selective mutism . As with most social anxieties , SM is more common in girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 70% of kids with SM have an immediate family member who also struggles with social anxiety .
