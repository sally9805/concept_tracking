SECTION I // The Town and the City // The Town and the City Worklogs // These meticulous logs of Kerouac 's progress on his first novel , The Town and the City , filled most of two journals , running from June 1947 to September 1948 , when Kerouac completed the manuscript . They begin with Kerouac 's summer " mood log . " In November 1947 , he begins his " winter writing log , " which catalogues his progress on The Town and the City . Other than a brief portion written in North Carolina , this was all written in New York while Kerouac was living with his mother in the small walk-up apartment above a drugstore at 94-10 Cross Bay Boulevard in the nondescript working-class town of Ozone Park , Queens . Leo Kerouac died in the same apartment in 1946 . It had two small bedrooms , a kitchen in which Kerouac wrote each night , and a sitting room with a piano . // The first journal itself measures about 7H by 8H inches . The cover has " 1947-1948 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble lettering below it and " JOURNALS " below that . In the bottom right is : // John Kerouac 1947 N.Y . June-December // The second journal these logs were pulled from , like the previous one , measures about 7H by 8H inches . On the cover " FURTHER NOTES " is written in block lettering , and below it is written " Well , this is the Forest of Arden . " In the bottom-right corner is the following : // J Kerouac 1947-48 N.Y.C. JUNE 16- ' 47- // Just made one of those great grim decisions of one 's life-not to present my manuscript of " T &amp; C " to any publisher until I 've completed it , all 380,000-odd words of it . This means seven months of ascetic gloom and labor-although doubt is no longer my devil , just sadness now . I think I will get this immense work done much sooner this way , to face up to it and finish it . Past two years has been work done in a preliminary mood , a mood of beginning and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult to life , but the work of life needs to get done , and art is work-what work ! ! I 've read my manuscript for the first time and I find it a veritable Niagara of a novel . This pleases me and moves me , but it 's sorrowful to know that this is not the age for such art . This is an excluding age in art-the leaver-outer F. Scott Fitzgeralds prevail in the public imagination over the putter-inner Thomas Wolfes . But so what . All I want from this book is a living , enough money to make a living , buy a farm and some land , work it , write some more , travel a little , and so-on . But enough of this . The next seven(TEEN) months are joyless to view-but there is as much joy in these things , there is more joy , than in flitting around as I 've done since early May , when I completed a 100,000-word section ( Mood Log ) . I might as well learn now what it is to see things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare in these writings . So I must fare in the grimmest , most efficient way there is , alone , unbidden , diligently again , always . The future has a glorious woman for me , and my own children , I 'm certain of that-I must come up to them and meet them a man with things accomplished . I do n't care to be one of those frustrated fathers . Behind me there must be some stupendous deed done-this is the way to marry , the way to prepare for greater deeds and work . So then-10-DAY MOOD LOG , JUNE 16-26 ' 47 // JUNE 15 ( SUNDAY ) -I find it almost impossible to get underway again : my mind seems blank and disinterested in these fictions . I give up after 500-words of a preliminary nature . // MONDAY 16-Feeling just as hopeless-feeling that I may not , after all , be able to complete anything . But I write 2000-words pertaining to the chapter , and things begin to break , or crumble &amp; seethe. // TUESDAY 17-Reluctance ! Reluctance always ! We hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm back in these regions of fumbling dark uncertain creation , but it 's my one and only world , and I 'll do the best I can . What would be the best medium for earnest thoughts if not a novel-earnest thoughts refined , as from crude one , into earnest motives - and the unconscious intuitive drift of great theme - thoughts rushing . I often think a notebook is better-but no , a novel , the very tale of earnestness and life-meaning , is the best thing . ( " It will be better for you . " - Mohammed ) // WEDNESDAY 18-A great physical lassitude and physical melancholy . I eat a big meal at 1 A.M. and walk two miles and do some writing-1800-words . Something 's wrong-I keep saying , " Why do I have to write this ? " It would be far better if I were asking myself- " Why do I want to write this ? " That 's the greatest writing , the unconscious . Someday I 'll learn , someday I 'll learn . I 've got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the problem . A monstrous job , but alright if I can only believe in its sure real progress . I wish I could write from the point of view of one hero instead of giving everyone in the story his due value-this makes me confused , many times disgusted . After all , I 'm human , I have my beliefs . I put nonsense in the mouths of characters I do n't like , and this is tedious , discouraging , disgusting . Why does n't God appear to tell me I 'm on the right track ? What foolishness ! // THURSDAY 19-Read Tolstoy 's moral essays and I writhed and wrestled to the conclusion that morality , moral concept , is a form of melancholy . Not for me , not for me ! Moral behaviour , yes , but no concepts whatever . There is a lugubrious senility in morality which is devoid of real life . Let 's just say-the substance of things is good , its form is good too until the form dries up , and then anyway , being bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form-husk there . All very general . I concluded that Dostoevsky 's wisdom is the highest wisdom in the world , because it is not only Christ 's wisdom , but a Karamazov Christ of lusts and glees . Let 's have a morality that does not exclude sheer life-loving ! Poor Tolstoy , anguished because he started rich and profligate-yet when a Count retires to the peasants , it 's really of some account to the world ( pun intended . ) Tolstoy must have been self-conscious of his moral importance in the eyes of the world . But Dostoevsky , Shakespeare-their morality grows in the earth , is hidden there and brooding . Dostoevsky never had to retire to morality , he was always it , and everything else also . ( Today 's busy thoughts . ) Wrote 2000-words , walked at night , saw a terrible auto crackup , but nobody killed . // FRIDAY 20-Things going smoothly again in my soul . Back to the humility and decency of writing-life . A Galloway friend visited me in the afternoon ; but wrote again at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , greatest ideas a writer can have is that he writes about someone merely " to show what kind of a mad character he is . " This idea has to be understood in the American sense . My Galloway friend wants specific conclusions from literary art , I agree with him , and I think nothing is more specific about a person than the tone and substance of his personality , his being , the fury and feel and look of it . To show " what a mad character " Francis is , I wrote a sketch of someone else in such a way as you may or may not like this someone else , but you see that Francis definitely does not like him . And what is the purpose of these arts and devices ? - what is the point of Francis ' dislike of someone else ? - specifically , that 's the kind of character he is , that 's what he does . This would take too long to explain-at least , this is my mood tonight , a good one , and I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week 's 8000-words. // SATURDAY 21-Day off . Went out in N.Y . // SUNDAY 22-Another thought that helps a writer as he works along-let him write his novel " the way he 'd like to see a novel written . " This helps a great deal freeing you from the fetters of self-doubt and the kind of self-mistrust that leads to over-revision , too much calculation , preoccupation with " what others would think . " Look at your own work and say , " This is a novel after my own heart ! " Because that 's what it is anyway , and that 's the point-it 's worry that must be eliminated for the sake of individual force . In spite of all this insouciant advice , I myself advanced slowly today , but not poorly , working on the final draft of the chapter . I 'm a little rusty . Oh and what a whole lot of bunk I could write this morning about my fear that I ca n't write , I 'm ignorant and worst of all , I 'm an idiot trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the will , in the heart ! To hell with these rotten doubts . I defy them and spit on them . Merde ! // MONDAY 23-Wrote in the afternoon for several hours , went into N.Y . on business of a minor sort , and came back at night and wrote some more . A day of intense feelings , described elsewhere , a day of great rending thoughts that twist one back to face sudden realities heretofore avoided-and there you are , facing them , like looking into the sun , blinking , admitting the truth . Well , a very dramatic way of growing up , and of describing it . The details of it ? -a fraction of those thoughts on paper and I would have enough thematic material to write ten epic American novels ( maybe a couple of Siamese novels thrown in . ) If the ordinary men , the men who work and keep their silence , by which fact they are not ordinary after all-if , then , the general run of men , were to write down all their thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literatures we 'd have ! And I struggle with these pencil-marks and scribblings. // TUESDAY 24-Wrote on the final draft . Chapter will be 10,000-wds. long now . // WEDNESDAY 25-Wrote . Am reading the New Testament , really for the first time . // THURSDAY 26-Wrote on final draft , working slowly . Went to N.Y . to complete plans for going to sea this summer-I need to make a living . Can I go about in camel 's hair , and leathern gird , and subsist on locust and wild honey ? - ( I probably could , with practice , but what of my wife , children , and mother ? But Jesus would teach them to look only to God , too . ) Still and all , if Jesus were sitting here at my desk tonight , looking out the window at all these people laughing and happy because the great summer vacation is beginning , perhaps he would smile , and thank his Father . I do n't know . People must " live , " and yet I know Jesus has the only answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will do so by remembering my father Leo Kerouac , a man who knew both of these things . This only breaks a little ground on the subject . I must see- // FRIDAY 27-Completed the work , and placed it in the main manuscript , where it is as a grain of sand on a beach . And what is this beach ? Only time will tell-I only know I should do it , I do it . 8,000-words in chapt. + 7,000-words in notebook ? 15,000 Now that 's all-there is nothing further to say on the subject of my work , which I have created myself , and whose face I do not know . What it is , what will come of it , I repeat , I do n't know . It will be there-that 's all one can be certain of-it will be there , it will abide and be there , and there 's nothing to say . This is darkness and yet this is also light-This is life and work . Do n't laugh , this is what it is. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it , whence does it come , where is it going , and why , and when , and who will know it ? Work like this is something alive , and full of unknowables , and it abides even as you do not know what it is. // So I console myself , saying , do not ask me what this book is , whence it came , why it came and for what purpose , do not point out its imperfections , gaucheries , crudenesses-rather , you might just as well say to me , looking at me in the eyes : - " What are you , whence came you , why , and for what crude imperfect purpose ? " - // Remember- // the flashing exhilirated maddening discoveries and truths of youth , the ones that turn young men into visionary demons and make them unhappy and happier than ever all at once-the truths later dropped with the condescension of " maturity " - these truths come back in true maturity , maturity being nothing less than disciplined earnestness-these truths will come back to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " flag of youth " any more , but make of them what they can-here : - for example-If a boy finds that idealism is the highest virtue of man and holds this idea up like a flag in the greedy self-centered world , if a boy once does this , and even names and numbers the idealisms , but later discovers that there is also a practical world-why , he will still later discover that the idealistic Jesus-soul is the only soul ! // The life 's gone out of it-out of anything which has artificially built itself outward from the substantial essence of itself-let 's make this clear-a town is more essential , more substantial , more living than a great Rome city , the great Rome city has deviated from the original purpose of a town , a place for people to live in , and become a city , a place for people not to live in , a place for people to hide from life , the earth , the meanings of family and soul and labour-let 's make this clear-the life 's gone out of it-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not into temptation " ) , anything which has lost itself in cant , artificiality , self-deceit and irrelevent horror , above all , in glittering triviality. // The earth will always be the same-only cities and history will change , even nations will change , governments and governors will go , the things made by men 's hands will go , buildings will always crumble-only the earth will remain the same , there will always be men on the earth in the morning , there will always be the things made by God 's hand-and all this history of cities and congresses now will go , all modern history is only a glittering Babylon smoking under the sun , delaying the day when men again will have to return to the earth , to the earth of life and God- // - Go ask the Central-American Indian who lives on the green earth that has grown on Mayan rooftops- // James Joyce did say- " History is a nightmare from which I am not yet awake . " But he is awake now , as sure as sunlight . // We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in the world we do not see . //
