<p> Suzy Gershman has attitude to spare . The articulate and opinionated author of 16 of Frommer 's " Born to Shop " guides was in town recently to promote the first San Francisco edition of the series , and she had plenty to say about that . <p> " I wanted to do a Los Angeles-San Francisco edition , but no one else wanted it but me , then we fought over which of the two cities , and finally , S.F. won , " she said . She does n't like the cover of the book . " I wanted a fabu , Gump's-like cover , ethnic fusion , hip elegance . I take responsibility for the wine bottle cover because I said I 'd accept anything except a Haight-Ashbury cover , never imagining we 'd get this . " <p> Gershman , who is based in Texas , and splits her time between France and the States , has written guides to shopping all over the world . Once you meet Gershman , you can see why she loves eclectic , European-influenced shops like Mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional chain stores . <p> She writes the way she talks . In her book , she introduces San Francisco like this : " It 's hippie , it 's dippy , it 's chic , it 's counter-chic ; it 's ' You 've got a tattoo , I 've got Gucci . ' " <p> Her sartorial style is also full of attitude . Her hair is deliberately artificially red . On the day we meet , she 's wearing an inexpensive Chinese silk top from Chinatown over an expensive folkloric Dries van Noten full skirt ; red socks and flats ; an armful of pricey Hermes enamel bangle bracelets ( seven , to be exact ) ; and three watches , set to Los Angeles , Paris and Hong Kong times . <p> Around her neck hangs a cheap Chinese silk pouch , which she uses to house her cell phone . She carries a big-bucks red Chanel slouchy bag . She 's just come from another jaunt to Chinatown , one of her favorite places in the city . <p> Also getting paid to shop around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the latest San Francisco edition of " Where to Wear , " a series of shopping guides by Fairchild &; Gallagher , which covers five American cities and four overseas locations . The 2006 San Francisco edition has just come out . <p> " Where to Wear " is almost entirely about clothes and accessories shopping in San Francisco proper , while " Born to Shop " includes home decor and where to eat , and takes in Napa , Sonoma and other Bay Area locales . <p> Like a restaurant reviewer , Gershman says she visits each shop three times in different seasons , always anonymously . Chamberlin says she visits each store once . <p> People are constantly rolling their eyes when the authors describe the difficulties of their jobs . <p> What woman who loves fashion does n't think that , she too , could write a shopping guide ? " No , you could n't , " Gershman responds . " I 'm a serious reporter ; I 've written for Time Inc . Information matters to me . I visit every single store in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research this book . The best part is , I can say what I think . " <p> Chamberlin , reached by phone , says it took her about three months to add about 20 entries to the new San Francisco edition of " Where to Wear . " <p> " Guidebooks are a lot of work , " she says . " You need to take it very seriously , make sure you get all your facts right and represent a good , wide range of stores . " Chamberlin comes from the world of public relations for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau . Her entries are informative , matter of fact and unironic . <p> " This is not a review , it 's a book of recommendations , but they are my opinions , " she says . " I do try to talk to as many people as possible about the stores . The book is not about me ; it 's for a lot of different types of shoppers . " <p> In contrast , Gershman 's chatty copy reads like a " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decor to where to have lunch to fabulous finds . " The basic idea of the book is that it should read like we were having lunch and I was telling you about my shopping day , " Gershman says . <p> As for the shopping entries , many overlap between the books , and there are some surprising omissions . Opinions clash . <p> Gershman loves anything smacking of chinoiserie . " Be still , my Chinese heart , " goes the beginning of the entry about Forgotten Shanghai home decor shop on Kansas Street ( where she suggests you purchase a large silk fortune cookie in which to stash your bedside condoms ) . <p> No such advice from Chamberlin , who ignores Chinatown all together . " If I had more room , I would have included Chinatown , " says Chamberlin , who lives in San Francisco . " I left it out because of space constraints . " <p> Gershman gives Hayes Valley short shrift , listing only five shops to visit . " The stores there simply did not touch my soul nor tickle my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I need the area to be more with it , more developed , before I can call it a destination , " she says . <p> Chamberlin loves Hayes Valley , and lists 20 shops to go see , like Minnie Wilde , the cute vintage-inspired boutique , and Paolo shoes , one of her favorite stores in the city  --  both of which Gershman ignored . <p> Gershman dislikes Neiman Marcus , saying it 's a " big yawn . " Chamberlin loves it , making note of its opulence , chic designer labels , big shoe department and glitzy jewelry displays . <p> Gershman 's personal style seems to dictate most of what she writes . " I have a big , American body , " she says . " If it fits me , I buy it . " Traditional , high-end stores , like Gucci , YSL , Dior , " bore me , " she says . " So you 've got the money to shop there . So what ? The stuff is all so far out . I much prefer Babette , Mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Area boutiques that specialize in artistic layered looks . <p> On the other hand , she says , " I love H &M.; I wore H &M; to my husband 's funeral ! It was a pleated black wrap skirt . " ( Which , she says , she paired with a Chanel jacket . ) <p> One book does n't quite tell the whole story . Both these guidebooks taken together offer a comprehensive list of fun places to discover , just browse or spend some serious money . <p> Suzy Gershman 's and Kelly Chamberlin 's five favorite Bay Area shopping spots <p> SUZY GERSHMAN <p> Mycra Pac Designer Outerwear Outlet , 535 Center St. , Moraga : " One of the highlights of my exploration of the Bay Area was the discovery of this line of micropore all-weather coats ... and here at the outlet they sell for half price . " <p> Forgotten Shanghai , 245 Kansas St. " A regular retail store with more than regular style ; a great way of using fabrics and furniture to make chinoiserie user-friendly . " <p> Jeremy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with some damaged merchandise . " I bought an Armani skirt for $13 ; some of the threads were unraveling ... but I did n't care ! " <p> Tail of the Yak , 2632 Ashby Ave. , Berkeley : " This is a place that feels like a dream . ... You 'll find everything from soaps to scents to antiques and gifts and tabletop items . " <p> Martha Egan , 1 Columbus Ave . " The kind of store that thrives in an atmosphere where creativity and originality are rewarded ; many of the clothes ... are one-of-a-kind and made from pieces of vintage fabrics . " <p> KELLY CHAMBERLIN <p> BCBG ( various locations ) : " Max Azria swears by the sexy , the swanky and the stylishly spirited . ... This universe of Euro-sophistication and American attitude also includes eyewear , swimwear and underwear , plus a bevy of accessories . " <p> Sarah Shaw , 3095 Sacramento St. " Shaw ... caters to all the best-dressed girls in this yuppity neighborhood . ... The retail queen carries the usual urban-chic suspects . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and plenty of party frocks for Pacific Heights players . " <p> My Roommate 's Closet , 3044 Fillmore St. " Bargain lovers of designer duds descend upon this boutique outlet to browse through the ever-changing array of merchandise . ... Owners Cate and Suzanne take stock from fashion-forward boutiques ... and offer it at 50 percent off . " <p> Paolo , 524 Hayes St. " This whimsical shop is full of Paolo Iantorno 's artistic Miu Miu-like shoes . ... They only make a limited number of copies of each design , so fashionistas never have to worry about seeing their shoes on someone else 's feet . " <p> DSW Shoe Warehouse , 111 Powell St. " Stripped down and stacked with boxes , this chain features lines like BCBG , Max Azria , Ferragamo , Fendi and Bebe , all received weekly and sold at 20 to 50 percent off regular department store prices .
