If you 're an empty nester looking to downsize , do n't let the weak housing market stop you . You may be working with less equity today than you had a year ago  --  but it could be more than you will have a year from now . And swapping your McMansion for something smaller today leaves you less exposed in a falling market . <P> Say you sell your big home for $600,000 and immediately buy a condo for $300,000 , and housing prices drop 10% over the next 12 months , as some economists forecast . In the condo , you would lose just $30,000 on paper ; in the house , you would lose $60,000 . The condo savings , however , do n't include expenses , which you incur whenever you move .
