The quest to duplicate a dog been something of a Holy Grail in the tricky field of mammalian cloning . Since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996 , scientists have followed with pigs , cattle , mice , rabbits , horses and cats . But though they tried mightily , nobody had ever created a genetic double of man 's best friend . Not , that is , until South Korean researcher Woo Suk Hwang and his team at Seoul National University brought Snuppy the puppy into the world  --  an animal whose entire genome came from a single cell from the ear of a three-year-old Afghan hound . Snuppy 's arrival , announced in Nature last week , earned grudging admiration from rival cloners in the U.S. <P> It also raised two big questions . The first , from many a dog owner : When can I clone my dog ? The second : What are they going to clone next ? The answer to the first is not very soon . The Korean achievement proves that cloning a dog is possible , not that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founded the cleverly named Genetic Savings &; Clone ( GS &C),; of Sausalito , Calif. , has spent seven years and more than $19 million trying in vain to clone a dog . Texas A &M; researcher Mark Westhusin , whose team cloned a cat on its second try in 2001 , abandoned the dog-cloning project several years ago . When the company approached reproductive physiologist George Seidel Jr . of Colorado State , he would n't even try . <P> One problem with dogs is that harvesting their eggs is extraordinarily labor intensive . You can get cow eggs from a slaughterhouse and incubate them to maturity in the lab . But because very few dog eggs will mature outside of a dog , viable eggs have to be extracted surgically . Once you have inserted the DNA you want to clone and tricked the eggs into becoming embryos , moreover , you ca n't just implant them at will in a surrogate bitch . Cows , goats and sheep can be thrown into estrus  --  readiness for pregnancy  --  by giving them a hormone shot . Not dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of dogs every day to figure out when they come into heat , " says Westhusin . That 's why Hwang 's team  --  which stays on the job seven days a week for 18 to 20 hours a day  --  was well matched for the task . " We had to be ready to collect oocytes at any time of day , even midnight or early morning , " says Hwang , adding , in a masterpiece of understatement . " Our work style helped , indeed . " <P> But it may not help pet owners . Cloning Snuppy ( the name comes from " Seoul National University puppy " ) took nearly three years and cost millions of dollars . Hwang 's ultimate motive , he says , is to create a research model for making stem cells that could cure disease in people . " Compared with rodents , " he says , dog cells " are more similar to human stem cells . " GS &C; still wants to capture the Fido-cloning market , though , and company scientists are trying to reduce the inefficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Ben Carlson , a company spokesman , it wo n't be cheap . " We 're charging $32,000 for a cat , " he says , " and it will be more for dogs . "
