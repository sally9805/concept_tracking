<p> San Francisco magazine has already proven it has brains . Now it wants to have beauty as well . <p> Much like the models so lovingly photographed in its newly redesigned pages , San Francisco magazine has dressed itself to the nines . <p> The stunning new look of the monthly mag , with its large format , lush photos and pages upon pages of glitzy high-end advertisements , represents a big bet . Can award-winning journalism coexist in the same pages as coverage of fancy fashions and society parties ? <p> The die was cast for the new magazine in April , when Modern Luxury Magazines added San Francisco to its stable of glossy publications , such as Angeleno and Riviera in Southern California and CS in Chicago . San Francisco represents a departure for Modern Luxury , in that San Francisco 's journalism has won numerous awards , including two turns as a finalist for a prestigious National Magazine Award , while Modern Luxury books typically devote themselves to the more fashionable side of life . <p> Terms of the deal were not disclosed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinkelspiel , Steve Rivera of Diablo Publications , San Francisco businessman Barry Traub and Warren Hellman , chairman of Hellman &; Friedman LLC  --  have all become shareholders in Modern Luxury . Modern Luxury 's expansion is backed by Roy Disney 's Shamrock Capital Growth Fund . <p> San Francisco and Modern Luxury also diverge in their historic business models , and it 's unclear where the twain shall meet . <p> San Francisco , which started out almost 40 years ago as San Francisco Focus , was a publication of KQED , the public television and radio station , and still derives more than half of its 140,000 circulation from KQED members , according to Dinkelspiel . Those members pay for the magazine . <p> In addition , San Francisco is sold on newsstands , and has about 20,000 non-KQED subscribers . <p> Modern Luxury magazines , on the other hand , are typically mailed free to people living in upscale ZIP codes and the salons and boutiques that serve them . San Francisco may experiment with some free circulation , Dinkelspiel said , but he believes " We already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merger was made out of strength . He said San Francisco was coming off its best year , with 20 percent growth in revenue . <p> " We were not even thinking of being for sale , " he said . " Newsstand sales were up . Renewals were higher . Ad sales were up . Profits were up . The magazine was doing extremely well , especially at a time when magazines have struggled . " <p> But when Dinkelspiel heard last year that Modern Luxury was contemplating starting a San Francisco magazine , he met with Michael Kong , the chief executive , and they quickly moved from talking " in the happy , open semi-jousting way that potential competitors do " to talking about a merger . <p> " We dreamed about the idea of marrying the really beautiful visual structure of his books with our journalistic and service-oriented traditional city magazine , " Dinkelspiel said . <p> That kind of marriage , according to Samir Husni , a professor at the University of Mississippi and one of the country 's foremost authorities on magazines , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyles of the rich and famous is an oxymoron . Once you start investigating the rich and famous , nobody 's going to let you in their parties to take their pictures . <p> " Sooner or later , " Husni said , " they are going to find themselves in a conflict . I can guarantee you that Modern Luxury is going to be more interested in comforting the comfortable rather than afflicting them . " <p> Bruce Kelley , the editor who spearheaded San Francisco 's journalistic renaissance , says it can be done . For one thing , he now has a lot more space to run stories . Two of the pieces in the November issue  --  one on the digital filmmaking taking place in the Bay Area , and the other on the Mondavi family  --  run more than 10,000 words . <p> In addition , the magazine can now showcase spectacular photos , as evidenced in a gorgeous layout on the new DeYoung Museum . <p> " We were a pretty jam-packed magazine before , " Kelley said . " This is more relaxing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile . I 'm just really excited to be editing a really visual magazine . " <p> Kelley takes pride in San Francisco 's investigative work , including pieces that went after top managers at the Presidio Trust , the San Francisco Zoo and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , as well as former Archbishop William Levada . Another award-winning piece spotlighted people wrongfully sentenced to life in prison . <p> " When we get a story that 's important , we 'll still do that traditional investigative journalism thing on a local scale , " Kelley said . <p> He said his new role model might be Vanity Fair . <p> " Vanity Fair has multiple personality disorder , " he said . " The readers take from it what they like and want . It runs great pieces on starvation in Africa , written by some of the best roving reporters in the world right now . On the other hand , there 's a fluffy celebrity piece every month . ... People take that all as one , even though how much sense does it make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " always had an aspect of luxury to our reporting . We covered the style world . We 've run photos of $10,000 dresses . We always have . Now , at this large size , you 're reminded of some of those juxtapositions a little more freshly . Over time , it 's all going to start to make sense again . That 's my goal as an editor , to make sense of it . " <p> One measure of the magazine may be in the reaction of the KQED subscribers . They 're presumed to be a serious group , by virtue of their paying to support public broadcasting when it 's something they get for free . Will they devour lush ads for jewelry stores and silk furnishings ? <p> John Boland , the chief content officer at KQED and the former publisher of the magazine , says their reaction will be interesting . <p> " My sense is the change is more superficial , " he said . " I do n't think the core content has been altered . I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . It looks and feels different . It does look beautiful . " <p> Yet even if they reject it , the magazine could still survive . KQED has about 200,000 members , and about 80,000 of them still ask to receive the magazine as part of their membership . Dinkelspiel said that figure is kept low deliberately because advertisers ca n't afford to pay to reach too many people . <p> Affordable ads may be another part of the formula . According to Husni , Modern Luxury charges low rates in order to build fat publications . " That 's why their magazines are 300 or 400 pages , with ad after ad after ad , " he said . " They shame advertisers to be in the publication . If they 're not in it , everyone else is in it . ... If you see an ad for Cartier , Tiffany has to be there . " <p> The redesign is also another salvo in the intense competition for the high-end San Francisco reader , a battle fueled by the arrival in town in recent years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nob Hill Gazette . <p> Of all those titles , 7x7 seems most directly in the crosshairs of the new San Francisco , which is almost designed on a template that 7x7 announced when it landed here in 2001 . At the time , 7x7 promised a larger format and beautiful fashion alongside investigative journalism , but its editor , veteran muckraker David Weir , was out the door before a year went by and in-depth pieces were shelved . <p> That wo n't return , but publisher Tom Hartle said 7x7 aims to do more " thoughtful journalism " as it seeks to fill what he sees as a new hole in the market for a traditional city magazine . He said he 's already taken calls from Whole Foods and Borders Books , who say they ca n't fit the new San Francisco in their racks , and want 7x7 to replace it . <p> " Now we 're sending hundreds and hundreds of copies over there , " he said . San Francisco is working to deliver new racks to its newsstands . <p> The large format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It enables ad sales people in New York to sell San Francisco as part of a group with the other Modern Luxury titles . <p> At a splashy party at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art earlier this month , Modern Luxury 's Kong declared that he did n't see any reason to mess with San Francisco 's recipe for success . " It 's been around for 39 years , " he said , giving the journalism a vote of confidence . <p> Husni , the magazine expert , is skeptical . <p> " New publishers in the beginning always tell you they 're not going to touch the magazine , " he said . " Nobody gives you money for nothing . " <p> " All it takes is one magazine to break the mold , and maybe that will be San Francisco , " Husni said . " The editorial team has the power to do so . How much can the publishing side be willing to live with that ? For the six months of the honeymoon , they will say yes . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will go back to what they know best , which is marketing journalism .
