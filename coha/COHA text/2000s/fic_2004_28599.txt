Chapter One SOME THINGS WERE never meant for a daughter to see . April Ashton was fairly certain that watching her mother stride into her father 's company Christmas party on the arm of a man clearly half her age was one of them . The bright red , skintight , sequin-covered dress Claire Ashton was wearing would have embarrassed April enough - it had a neckline that plunged almost to her navel . But her mother was also flaunting a companion who looked barely twenty-five and had the body of a Chippendale dancer . What was Claire thinking ? Pushing her tortoise-shell glasses up to the bridge of her nose , April straightened her own simple black calf-length dress and backed into a corner while she searched the crowded ballroom for her father . Walt Ashton might have launched her mother 's midlife crisis , but he was not a subtle man and he was n't going to take this well . As the owner of Ashton Automotive , he was too accustomed to being in charge . He 'd built his L.A.-based company with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was one of the most successful chains of auto-parts stores in the western United States . A hush rolled through the room . Evidently everyone was beginning to recognize the woman in red . It had taken them a few seconds ; April understood why . Claire hardly resembled the woman she used to be . Since April 's mother and father had split up four months ago , her mother had lost thirty-five pounds , bleached her hair platinum-blond , acquired a tan even though it was winter , and cast aside her matronly wardrobe for ... well , for something better suited to an actress on Sex and the City . Not that April considered herself a fashion expert . She 'd long known her brain was her best asset and did n't bother much with fancy clothes or beauty aids . She 'd never possessed the kind of curves that would turn a man 's head . Which was just as well . She 'd learned that few men had egos that could tolerate dating a woman with an IQ above 160 . Even the gold diggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone out with some of the physicists where she worked , but nothing romantic had ever developed . She and the men she dated invariably fell to discussing theories and models , and soon became nothing more than mutually respectful peers . Suddenly , Rita Schmidt , from Accounting , who was standing not far away , seemed to notice the whispering that had replaced the initial hush . Craning her head , she stood on tiptoe to see what was happening . " Hey , is n't that ... " Les Burrows , at Rita 's elbow , followed her gaze . " Oh , my God - that 's the boss 's wife ! " This comment elicited a whole storm of response from others in the same group . " You mean his ex-wife .... " " They 're not divorced yet .... " " Believe me , that 's a mere technicality .... " " It 's no secret that Mr. Ashton 's been diddling his massage therapist for the past six months . " A few chuckles resounded at the diddling comment , and April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what was happening to her parents , why her father had strayed after so many years . But she had a lot of work to do at the lab and did n't want to be here . Parties were n't her thing . Give her a good book on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , challenge her to a heated debate on quantum physics , but please do n't ask her to dance .... She could n't leave , though . She 'd promised her father she 'd stay for the entire evening . He 'd told her that Keith Bodine , the local plant manager , was looking forward to seeing her ; she did n't return Keith 's interest , but her father hoped someday she would . Besides , April was the only one who could keep some semblance of peace between her parents . Sometimes she hated being an only child . " I guess we 're going to be treated to another family fight , " someone else in the crowd whispered loudly , obviously unaware that April was standing so close . April leaned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in her mother 's direction - at which point his eyes nearly popped out of his head . His girlfriend , Regina Parks , stood beside him , but that did n't seem to matter . His face darkened to an unhealthy shade of maroon , and he started tearing through the crowd as if he 'd strangle his estranged wife . April abandoned the safety of her dark corner and intercepted her father before he could reach Claire and her muscle-bound date . " Dad ! Wait ! " Bringing him to a stop by clutching his arm , she continued to hold on to him , just in case getting his hands around Claire 's neck had really occurred to him . Since her mother had moved in with her several weeks ago , violence had certainly crossed April 's mind once or twice . Like yesterday , when she 'd come home to her small house at Redondo Beach to find that her mother had rearranged all her furniture . Her father looked at her , but April was n't sure he saw her . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare she ! " April struggled to retain her hold . " Hang on , Dad . You two have been going through a lot of changes lately , " she said , trying to stave off the worst of his anger . " You 've barely started divorce proceedings . She 'll settle down soon . " At least April hoped she would . Her mother 's recent talk about getting breast implants was n't a good sign , but April was trying to be optimistic . " Let 's not make a scene , okay , Daddy ? " " Not make a scene ? " he bellowed . Everyone within twenty feet turned to stare . " She 's already made a scene ! My God , there 's not a man here who is n't stepping on his tongue ! Who invited her , anyway ? " " She owns half the company , remember ? " April said softly . " Like hell she does ! " ( Continues ... )                @ @ @ @ @
