BELLE AND SEBASTIAN THE LIFE PURSUIT <P> Scotland 's most adorable rock collective continues to mess around with disco rhythms and glam-rock guitar licks , but the best songs on its sixth album are the ones that come on the softest . Dress Up in You is built on the same blueprint  --  sad piano , whispered Stuart Murdoch vocals and a gradual revelation that the song is sung from a female perspective  --  as many of B &S's; earlier hits , while Another Sunny Day takes a pickup soccer game ( " I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines/ Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds " ) and elevates it into a love story of epic proportions . <P> NEKO CASE FOX CONFESSOR BRINGS THE FLOOD <P> Whether sitting in with pop-punk group the New Pornographers or standing on her own as an alt-country princess , Case has always had a voice that lingers like a train whistle . What she has n't had is an album worthy of her talent . The lyrics on this collection of gothic outsider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widow 's Toast are like under-grad verse about Faulkner 's Yoknapatawpha County ) , but with excellent backing from Calexico and Garth Hudson of the Band and flawless singing , Case sells them as undeniably haunting and catchy mood pieces . <P> CYRUS CHESTNUT GENUINE CHESTNUT What makes Chestnut the best jazz pianist of his generation is a willingness to abandon notes and to play space . He rescues Roberta Flack 's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and Bread 's truly horrible AM-radio hit If from years of accumulated treacle by tinkling out the barest hint of melody , confidently letting each note float around until it resolves itself in your head . He 's equally adept at spelling his minimalism with funk on the original Ellen 's Song , and closes with a solo version of Lord , I Give Myself to You , in which he harmonizes with himself in glorious fashion . <P> GOLDFRAPP SUPERNATURE <P> Alison Goldfrapp has described her band 's third album as a " place to take part in fortnightly disco sances . " If you like your dance divas nuttier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's surprising is that Goldfrapp ( who started out as the wordless howler on Tricky 's finest albums ) and musical partner Will Gregory also have a sublime pop sensibility . Ooh la la is a sticky homage to Norman Greenbaum 's Spirit in the Sky and Kylie Minogue 's lyric book ( " switch me on/ turn me up " ) . Meanwhile , the synth-rock ballad Number 1 has enough instantly memorable atmospherics to make its title prophetic . <P> NE-YO IN MY OWN WORDS Unlike most R &B; singers , Ne-Yo writes his own material ( or co-writes it , anyway ) , and the album title lets you know he would like a little respect for his work . The breakaway hit So Sick , a ballad about a brokenhearted guy who ca n't stop listening to brokenhearted ballads , delivers a light , genre-spoofing twist , but the other songs soar less on writerly sophistication than on Ne-Yo 's deftness with a hook and particularly sincere brand of shamelessness . On It Just Ai n't Right , he samples ' 80s legend DeBarge and confesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and I call your name "  --  a lyric that could have been written by a hundred of his predecessors , but only Ne-Yo would think to deliver it as if it were the world 's highest compliment . It 's not right , but it 's certainly memorable .
