Just months after revealing he suffers from MS , talk show host Montel Williams splits with his wife Photograph " He was always very protective of her , " an old friend says of Montel and Grace ( in November ) . // He could n't have sounded more grateful , more loving , more sincere . " Gracie 's the reason I 'm able to get out of bed every morning , " TV talk show host Montel Williams told PEOPLE in November , just months after stunning fans with the news that he suffers from multiple sclerosis . " She 's taken care of everything , allowing me to keep it together . " As he spoke , his wife , Grace , sat by her husband 's side in the wood-paneled study of their 13,000-sq. - ft. home in Greenwich , Conn .

" I have all confidence that she will always be there for him . " Echoing that sentiment was family friend Kim Hines , who put the couple up when Williams visited the Salt Lake City doctor who helped to put a name to the debilitating symptoms that had plagued him on and off for 10 years . " Every time I see them , " she said , " it seems like they 're happier . " A touching picture . Or was it a pose ? On April 10 , Williams made another shocking revelation : " After going in separate directions for quite some time , Grace and I have decided to end our seven-year marriage . In light of our difficulties , we agreed to divorce last November . " Since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their separation and making arrangements for joint custody of their children , Montel II , 6 , and Wyntergrace , 5 . He went on to praise Grace for being " very supportive concerning my medical condition . " In her own statement , Grace , 36 , said , " It 's a difficult time for the whole family . " Both comments came shortly after Grace was contacted by the National Enquirer , which claimed to have photos of Williams with another woman , and asked how she felt about that . Shortly after that call , Grace tossed her husband 's clothes onto the lawn of their Greenwich home . The following day , Williams moved into a New York City apartment . Grace 's friends quickly rallied in support . " She must have felt incredibly betrayed and hurt , " says a former roommate . " I 've never seen her throw a fit or a tantrum or even raise her voice . " Photograph " I do n't know about any marital problems , " Montel 's dad , Herman Williams , says of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 98 ) . Photograph Grace 's mother , Dori , who stays at the Williamses ' Connecticut estate , said last fall that the MS diagnosis " drew us closer . " // The couple met in 1991 during the first year of the syndicated Montel Williams Show , when Grace and her mother were tapped for a segment on mother-daughter showgirls . Grace , who danced topless in Las Vegas under the name Bambi Jr. , was hard to ignore when she appeared on the show in a white corset , garter belt and thigh-high stockings . " By this time I had interviewed dozens of gorgeous women , " Williams wrote in his 1996 memoir Mountain , Get Out of My Way , " but no one had ever struck me in quite the same way . " Williams asked her to dinner , only to be rebuffed . But Grace finally agreed to lunch , then another lunch , until he persuaded her to join him for dinner .

" They were always laughing or telling jokes or silly stories , " recalls a former production assistant on the Williams show . " He always described it as a love-at-first-sight kind of thing . " The following June they married at the Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas . The wedding came shortly after Williams 's divorce from his first wife , Rochele See . Though that marriage lasted nine years , Williams wrote in Mountain , " I knew it was over after a month . " He and See , whom he met in the mid- ' ' 70s while both were serving with the military in Guam , had two daughters . " But in every other respect the relationship was a disaster , " he wrote . " We drifted apart as quickly as we came together .

There are two daughters from the previous marriage and her own two . " Whatever the immediate cause of the couple 's split , there is at least some suggestion that Grace may see a silver lining . Last November , Grace , who has taken bit parts in TV shows in hopes of jump-starting her acting career , was finishing Little Pieces , a film she cowrote and starred in , and which Williams directed and coproduced . Explaining how she came to write the script , she said , " I gave up my career to be with my husband and have children .

I just cried for hours because I felt I had lost the person I am .
