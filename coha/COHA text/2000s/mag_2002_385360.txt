" She got her credentials from the Hartt College of Music in Hartford , CT . The reason for giving it all up ? Disco ! " What occurred in the seventies was disco music , " she recalled .

" Taking a break during that period was very positive for her . She got a chance to experience motherhood . " Taking that break did give me an opportunity to do some things I 'm thrilled about , " she said . " And I will forever be grateful that disco came along .
