Excerpts // In the year or two before I actually started to skip periods , I began to experience an increasingly common feeling of irritability whenever my work was interrupted or I had to contend with a co-worker or an employee who was not as committed to accomplishing the job as I was . Looking back , I recall that when I was in my thirties and my children were younger , their interruptions when I was in the middle of writing an article or talking on the phone were only mildly irritating to me . My love and concern for their welfare usually overrode any anger or frustration I might have felt . // But as I approached menopause , I found myself unable to tolerate distractions like my eighteen year old daughter asking me , " When is dinner ? " when she could clearly see I was busy . Why , I wondered , was it always my responsibility to turn on the stove and begin to think about my family 's food needs , even when I was n't hungry and was deeply engrossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner preparations started ? Why did my family seem to be almost totally paralyzed when it came to preparing a meal ? Why did they all wait in the kitchen , as though unable to set the table or pour a glass of water , until I came into the room and my mere presence announced , " Mom 's here . Now we get to eat " ? ... Still , during my childbearing years I accepted this , mostly good-naturedly , as part and parcel of my role as wife and mother . And in so doing , I unwittingly perpetrated it , partly because it felt so good to be indispensable . // During perimenopause , I lost patience with this behavior on all levels , whether at home or at work . I could feel a fiery volcano within me , ready to burst , and a voice within me roaring , " Enough ! You 're all able-bodied , capable individuals . Everyone here knows how to drive a car and boil water . Why is my energy still the organizing principle around here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irritability over petty family dynamics were the first faint knocks on the door marked Menopausal Wisdom signaling that I needed to renegotiate some of my habitual relationship patterns . Nor did I know that by the time I began to actually skip periods and experience hot flashes , my life as I had known it for the previous quarter century would be on the threshold of total transformation . As my cyclic nature rewired itself , I put all of my significant relationships under the microscope , began to heal the unfinished business from my past , experienced the first pangs of empty nest , and established an entirely new and exciting relationship with my creativity and vocation . // All of the changes I was about to undergo were spurred , supported and encouraged by the complex and intricate brain and body changes that are an unheralded - but inevitable and often overwhelming - part of the menopausal transition . There is much , much more to this midlife transformation than " raging hormones . " Research into the physiological changes taking place in the perimenopausal woman is revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to childbearing , our bodies - and , specifically , our nervous systems - are being , quite literally , rewired . It 's as simple as this : Our brains are changing . A woman 's thoughts , her ability to focus , and the amount of fuel going to the intuitive centers in the temporal lobes of her brain are all plugged into , and affected by , the circuits being rewired . After working with thousands of women who have gone through this process , as well as experiencing it myself , I can say with a great assurance that menopause is an exciting developmental stage - one that , when participated in consciously , holds enormous promise for transforming and healing our bodies , minds , and spirits at the deepest levels . // As a woman in midlife today , I am part of a growing population that is an unprecedented forty million strong . This group is no longer invisible and silent , but a force to be reckoned with : educated , vocal , sophisticated in our knowledge of medical science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think about it : forty million women , all undergoing the same sort of circuitry update at the same time . By virtue of our sheer numbers , as well as our social and economic influence , we are powerful - and potentially dangerous to any institution build upon the status quo . It 's a safe bet the world is going to change for the better . // It 's no accident that the current movement of psychospiritual healing is composed largely of women in their thirties , forties , and fifties . We are awakening en masse and beginning to deliver a much-needed message of health , hope , and healing to the world . // My personal experience tells me that the perimenopausal lifting of the hormonal veil - the monthly cycle of reproductive hormones that tends to keep us focused on the needs and feelings of others - can be both liberating and unsettling . The midlife rate of marital separation , divorce , and vocational change confirms this . I , for one , had always envisioned myself married to the same man for life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always been one of my most cherished dreams . At midlife , I , like thousands of others , have had to give up my fantasies of how I thought my life would be . I had to face , head on , the old adage about how hard it is to lose what you never really had . It means giving up all your illusions , and it is very difficult . But for me the issue was larger than where , and with whom , I would grow old . It was a warning , coming from deep within my spirit , that said , " Grow ... or die . " Those were my choices . I chose to grow . //
