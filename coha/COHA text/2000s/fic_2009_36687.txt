1 <br> City of the Dead <p> New Orleans  --  St. Louis No. 3 <br> March 15 <p> " So where 's this weird-ass bit of hoodoo supposed to be ? " Von asked . <p> " Beside a tomb , " Dante said as they scaled the cemetery 's locked , wrought-iron fence , both vaulting with ease over the black bars and onto the path below . <p> " Yeah , but which tomb ? " <p> " Baronne , I think , " Dante said , pushing his hood back . He chose the paved central path and followed it past gleaming white crypts . He drew in a deep breath of cherry-blossom-scented air . But beneath the sweet scent , he caught a whiff of decay , moldering bones , and old , old grief . <p> " These N'awlins cemeteries are creepy as hell , " Von commented . " I ca n't imagine what they 'd look like in daylight . " <p> " Did n't you ever check ' em out when you were still mortal ? " <p> " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , creepy . Especially for a delicate flower like moi . " He paused , touching a finger to his ear . " Wait ... breaking news . Correction , seems I ai n't a delicate flower . " He shrugged . " Who knew ? Mama musta lied . " <p> Dante laughed . " Yeah , you 're gon na be fun on the tour bus . " <p> " Man , I 'm fun anywhere . And we should be heading to the airport soon . " <p> " Yeah , yeah , I know . " <p> Dante read the names on the tombs as he passed : DUFOUR , GALLIER , ROUQUETTE , and listened for the quiet pulse that had drawn him to St. Louis No. 3 . When he caught the letters BA , he stopped , his heart kicking against his ribs . <p> He hears the sound of his own voice , raw and demanding , the words echoing in the cathedral 's vaulted silence . " What was her name ? Genevieve ... what ? " <p> Dante 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He closed his eyes . His breathing quickened and fire flickered to life within his veins . Smoldered within his heart . He opened his eyes . Pale moonlight shafted through the thick , twisted oaks , dripped from the Spanish moss . <p> " Baptiste , " he whispered . <p> &lt; You okay , little brother ? &gt; Von sent . <p> Dante nodded . He looked at the tomb and finished reading the name chiseled into the white stone : BASTILLE . He released his breath . His hands unknotted and an emotion he could n't name curled through him , damping the flames into embers . <p> Did his mother even have a grave ? <p> A hand squeezed his shoulder and he looked up into Von 's moonlit , green eyes . The nomad had shoved his El Diablo shades on top of his head . <p> " You sure , man ? No pain ? Cuz I thought I felt  --  " <p> Dante cupped Von 's whisker-rough face between his hands . He brushed his lips against Von 's , tasted him , whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of the mustache framing the nomad 's mouth . <p> " I 'm good , mon ami , " Dante replied . Dropping his hands , he twisted free of the nomad 's grip . " And I do n't need a fucking nanny . " <p> Von extended a middle finger . Arched an eyebrow . " How about that ? You need that ? " Extended the finger on his other hand . " How about some more ? " <p> " I 'll take it all , " Dante said , " gOnT toi pas . " <p> Dropping his El Diablos back over his eyes , Von shook his head and sighed . " Boy 's hopeless as hell . " <p> " Merci . " <p> As they resumed walking the moonlit path , a hush swirled through the city of the dead , isolating it from the world beyond the wrought-iron fence like a deep black moat . The air was so still the muffled clink of the chains on Dante 's leather jacket and the creak of Von 's leather chaps echoed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the faint rhythm that had  --  for the last couple of weeks  --  filled his mind just as Sleep swept over him . Primal . Like a tribal drum beating within the earth 's heart . <p> Like the wordless song that poured , at times , from Lucien and into him , its complicated melody meshing with the refrain of his answering song . Similar , yeah , but not the same . This rhythm reminded him of the unfamiliar song that had rung through his mind that night in Club Hell . <p> The night Jay had been murdered , dying as Dante had struggled to reach him . <p> I knew you 'd come . <p> The same night he 'd found Lucien broken and impaled on the checkered floor of St. Louis Cathedral , his wings torn , his song nothing but cooling embers . And had learned that Lucien , his closest friend , his ami intime , was something else altogether . <p> You look so much like her . <p> Pain prickled at Dante 's temples . Send it below . Focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his mind again like smoke . A muted , desperate rhythm . Beckoning him . He moved , racing past whitewashed and time-weathered statues guarding tombs , standing sentinel to loss . Trees and marble monuments blurred into one flickering shadow as he picked up speed . <p> The song 's deep-earth drumming pulsed in time with the blood flowing through his veins , increasing in intensity until he felt it resonate within his own chest . Then the sound vanished . <p> Dante slowed to a stop . He stood next to a tomb marked BARONNE . And crouched beside it , holding a bouquet dead and dried , its wings curved forward , mouth wide-open , was a stone angel . <p> The one rumored on the streets to have appeared in the cemetery overnight . <p> Magic , some said . Gris-gris , others believed . A sign . <p> So mortals whispered , yeah . <p> And nightkind said nothing , their silence uneasy . <p> A gust of cool air smelling of leather , frost , and old motor oil fluttered his hair as Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the nomad said . " Weird-ass hoodoo shit . " <p> " Ai n't just hoodoo shit , llygad , " Dante murmured , his gaze on the stone angel . He felt Von step back a few paces as he took up his duties as Eye . <p> Observing . Safeguarding . Composing . <p> Candles in glass holders burned before the stone angel . The smell of vanilla and wax curled into the air . Plastic Mardi Gras beads hung from the wing tips and around the corded throat . Good luck x s chalked in blue , yellow , and pink decorated the path in front of the statue , and curled scraps of paper nestled against the taloned feet . <p> " One of the Fallen , looks like , " Dante said . Something else Lucien had n't bothered to mention . " And someone 's turned him to fucking stone . " <p> Dante knelt , picked up one of the pieces of paper and read it . Loa of the stone , grant me protection from evil . Keep me safe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the stone foot . <p> He studied the squatting shape . Moonlight glimmered and sparkled like ice along faint patterns etched into the wings . But not feathered wings , no . Like Lucien 's , these wings would be black and as smooth as warm velvet to the touch , the undersides streaked with purple . Waist-length hair framed the screaming face . The figure was nude , except for some kind of thick collar-bracelet twisted around the throat and a bracelet around one bicep . And most definitely male . <p> Von sent an image of the collar-bracelet. &lt; Torc . Celtic . Ancient . &gt; <p> <p> Moonlight illuminated a dark stain on the statue 's forehead . It looked swiped on , a blood symbol of some kind , maybe a hoodoo vTvT . Dante leaned forward , leather jacket creaking , and touched the stain . Residual power crackled against his fingertips like static electricity . A tiny blue flame arced in the space between his hand and the statue . <p> Fallen magic . <p> Catching a whiff of Lucien 's **27;215;TOOLONG scent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded the angel , wondering what Lucien had done and why . To turn one of his own kind into stone ... <p> Then he remembered Lucien 's words from that night : Shield yourself . Shut it out . Promise me you wo n't follow . <p> Dante would bet anything he was looking at the reason why for that promise . Touching a finger to the collar  --  torc  --  around the angel 's throat , he closed his eyes and listened . Song whispered in through his fingertips . His breath caught in his throat as his own song , chaotic and dark , answered . The stone beneath his fingers tremored like a rung bell . <p> Pain suddenly bit into his mind . White light strobed behind his closed eyes . Migraine storm warning . Dante opened his eyes and started to rise , then hesitated , one knee still down on the pavement . The fading song plucked at him like desperate fingers . <p> Promise me ... <p> He wrapped his left hand around the angel 's dead bouquet . The sun-dried stems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cindered wood . Like unspoken truth . <p> You look so much like her . <p> You knew all this time ? And you never said a word ? <p> Anger swept through Dante and music pulsed white-hot at his core . He poured energy into the wasted bouquet 's remains . Song , dark and driven and wild , raged through his mind , from his heart , and spiraled around the skeletal stems . Blue fire kindled in his palms and shimmered against the stone . <p> The cupped stone fingers now held green stems topped by tightly closed buds . But pain shafted through Dante 's mind again and his rhythm shifted , blasted harsh and dissonant notes , and his song spilled away into the night . <p> His hand slid from the angel and he staggered up to his feet . Pain twisted through his mind , snagged his thoughts like barbed wire . He clenched his jaw . Tried to will the pain away . <p> Send it below . <p> The cemetery spun ; the moonlit tombs wheeled white beneath the cypress . Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . <p> Behind , he heard Von calling his name . <p> Within , voices whispered . Dante-angel ? <p> Above , he heard a rush of wings . <p> Dante closed his eyes and touched fingers to his temples . Sweat slicked his skin . A familiar , cool touch pressed against his mind , seeking admittance . Lucien . He tightened his shields , refusing . <p> Fingers squeezed his shoulder . " How the hell do you do that ? " Von 's voice , low and tight , sounded uneasy . <p> Dante opened his eyes . A black-flowered and thorned bouquet swayed within the angel 's stone grip as though caught in a gentle breeze . Or as if it moved on its own , dancing to the song cupped within the heart of each dark blossom . <p> " Fuck . " He 'd done it wrong . Pain throbbed behind his eyes . " Not what I intended . " <p> " Intended or not , " Von said , " that gift ai n't nightkind , least not that I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . " <p> " Yeah , my thought too . " <p> Von gently turned Dante around . " How 's your head ? " he asked . <p> Dante shrugged and wiped his nose with the back of his hand . Blood smeared his skin . " I 'm okay . " <p> Sliding his shades up , the nomad cocked an eyebrow and regarded him dubiously . " Uh-huh , " he said , then dropped the shades back over his eyes . <p> Dante glanced at the stone angel and the midnight twist of flowers in its hand . " Why ? " He nodded at the offerings tucked at the angel 's feet . " Why do mortals pray this way ? What do they hope to gain ? " <p> Von stroked his mustache , considering . " Hard to say , " he replied . " A lot of different reasons . Some might be prayers for a friend or relative who 's in trouble , maybe for protection or success , or to be healed from something . " <p> Dante 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingered a loop of smooth beads dangling from one wing tip . " Did you do stuff like this ? When you were mortal ? Pray , I mean . " <p> " No , not like this , " the nomad replied . " And I never prayed to anyone , ya know ? I just kinda said things that I really hoped would happen , like wishing a friend safe on a long journey or saying good-bye to one that 'd died . " <p> " Who hears the wishes and good-byes ? " <p> " I forget you do n't know this stuff . " Von shook his head . " Who hears the wishes and good-byes ? The speaker does , " he said , voice quiet , reflective . " And you hope that what you say from the heart has power . Power to protect , power to reach the ears of the dead . A spoken thing or a wished-hard thing takes a shape within the heart , man . Takes shape . Becomes real . " <p> " Becomes real , " Dante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-byes can heal the hurt . Or at least start the healing . " <p> This does n't need to be good-bye . <p> Heather 's words whispered through Dante 's memory . An image of her filled his mind : Rain-beaded red hair , black trenchcoat , cornflower-blue eyes , she 'd looked into him with her steady gaze . She was a fed , yeah , but a woman of heart and steel too . He remembered telling her : Run from me . <p> She had and now she was safe . <p> From him , maybe . But was she safe from the Bureau ? She 'd uncovered a nasty secret in D.C. Now she was caught between the truth and a hard fucking place . She was on her own in Seattle , without backup . <p> But not for long . <p> The West Coast leg of the tour ended with two gigs in Seattle followed by two weeks of downtime before the tour picked up again . Trey had already ferreted Heather 's address , had teased it free from the Seattle DMV 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling a tourist on Bourbon Street , Tee-Tee . <p> Dante let go of the Mardi Gras necklace , the beads clicking against the stone wing , and turned to face Von . " You got paper ? A pen ? " <p> Von frowned . " Fuck , I du n no . " He patted his jacket pockets , leather creaking with his movement . " I hope you ai n't planning on me taking dictation . " He pulled a Bic pen from an inside pocket . <p> Dante took the pen , holding it between the fingers of his left hand as the nomad fished a wadded-up receipt out of his front jeans pocket and handed it to him . <p> Kneeling on the pavement in front of the stone angel , Dante smoothed the crumpled piece of paper against his leather-clad thigh . His pulse raced as he scrawled his prayer on the receipt , wondering if it had the power to protect , the power to reach the ears of the dead . <p> Dante folded the piece of paper , then raised it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted the prayer with dark color . He laid it at the angel 's taloned feet among all the other paper prayers and chalk wishes . <p> Dante stood , glanced at Von . Wondered at the expression on his face , shadowed and a little sad . A smile touched the nomad 's mustache-framed lips as he took his pen back and tucked it away again . <p> " You ready , little brother ? " he asked , voice low . <p> " What time does the plane leave ? " <p> " In about two hours . " <p> Dante nodded . " Let 's go . " <p> A sudden gust of vanilla- and wax-scented air blew Dante 's hair into his eyes . The candles flickered wildly and a few dimmed to blue , then died . Von 's gaze shifted up and his brow furrowed . Dante 's muscles knotted . Pain pulsed at his temples . He saw his own tension mirrored in the nomad 's face . <p> Hoped we 'd slip away without a scene . But maybe I need to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucien 's deep voice resonated from the sky above . <p> Pushing his hair back with both hands , Dante drew in a deep breath , swiveled around , and watched as Lucien descended from the star-flecked night , black wings stroking gracefully through the air . <p> Dressed only in expensive black slacks , Lucien De Noir touched bare feet to the flagstones bordering the Baronne tomb . His wings flared once more before folding behind him , their tips arching above his head . He straightened to his full six-eight height , his black hair spilling over his tight-muscled shoulders to his waist . His handsome face was composed , watchful . Gold light glimmered in the depths of his eyes . <p> " Wait , huh ? " Dante shifted his weight to one hip and crossed his arms over his chest . " Give me one fucking reason why . " <p> " You ca n't go on tour . " <p> " That 's a command , not a reason . And fuck you . " <p> " You 're not well . Your control slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire blazed to life , fused with the pain in Dante 's head , the ache within his heart . " Fuck you twice , " he said , voice low and strained . <p> Lucien 's face remained impassive , but tendrils of his black hair lifted as though breeze-caught . " You know I speak the truth . " <p> " Wow . " Dante 's gaze locked with Lucien 's . " Is that like a first for you ? " <p> A muscle jumped in Lucien 's jaw . Shifting his attention to Von , he said , " I need to speak alone with my son . " <p> &lt; You want me to stay ? Play referee ? &gt; Von sent . <p> &lt; No , I 'm cool . Do n't worry . I 'll meet you at the bike . &gt; <p> &lt; Your nose is still bleeding , little brother . &gt; <p> " Merde , " Dante muttered , wiping his nose against the sleeve of his jacket . <p> Von studied him for another moment before nodding . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the path past moon-washed crypts to the cemetery gates . " Play nice , you two , " he called over his shoulder . <p> " I did n't lie to you , " Lucien said , voice tight . <p> " D'accord , you did n't lie . But you kept the fucking truth from me and that 's the same as lying . Happy now ? " <p> " How can I be when your search for the truth is tearing you apart ? " <p> " My problem , not yours . Stay outta my business . " <p> " Impossible . You are my business ! " <p> " Fuck you ! I ai n't your business , never was ! " Pain fractured Dante 's vision , throbbed at his temples . Blood trickled hot from his nose . " We were friends , remember ? " <p> Lucien looked away . His fingers reached for the pendant that no longer hung at the base of his throat  --  the rune for friendship , for partnership , that Dante had given him  --  then closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost the pendant or how , but its loss seemed somehow karmic to him . <p> " I made a mistake , one I regret , " Lucien said , returning his gaze to Dante 's . Amber fire flared in his eyes . " But I refuse to keep apologizing . " <p> " I never asked for a fucking apology . " Rubbing his temples , Dante closed his eyes . Nothing looked right . Blurry . Distorted . " And I ai n't asking for one now either . Quit pushing ! Leave me the fuck alone so I can find what I 'm looking for . I need the truth or the past will always control me . " <p> " The truth is never what you hope it will be , Dante . And the cost is always higher than you imagine . Much higher , " Lucien said , his deep voice as low as a sigh . " I thought I could keep you safe in silence . I thought I could hide you , help you heal from all the damage done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered his hands . Safe in silence ? <p> " I thought I could contain your song or at least muffle it so it could n't be heard . " Lucien closed the distance between them with one long stride . His dark-earth scent curled around Dante . " But I was wrong . " <p> Dante straightened , suddenly uneasy  --  something he 'd never felt with Lucien before . " Hide me ? From who ? Are you talking about Bad Seed ? " <p> " I did n't know Bad Seed even existed . No , I hid you from others . Powerful others who would use you without mercy . " <p> " Others ... like him ? " Dante nodded at the stone angel hunched on the path . <p> Lucien 's gaze flicked to the statue , resting for a moment on the flowers swaying in its hand , then back to Dante . " Yes , like Loki . I trapped him to protect you . " <p> " Yeah ? " Dante questioned softly . " From what ? " <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the core , iced his heart . " What the hell are you talking about ? Why would I need protection from them ? " <p> " You are n't merely True Blood and Fallen , child . You 're much more . " <p> " And that is ... ? " <p> " Creawdwr . " A reverent note sounded in Lucien 's voice . Pride gleamed in his eyes . " You 're a Maker . The only one in existence . " <p> A chill rippled down the length of Dante 's spine . He looked at the bouquet bobbing in Loki 's hand . " Is that why I can do shit like this ? " <p> " Yes . You can create anything and everything . Your song carries the chaos rhythm of life . And you can unmake , as well . " <p> Dante 's memory flipped back . The center . Johanna Moore screams as his song pulls her apart , divides her into elements ... <p> Dante returned his gaze to Lucien , his hands curling into fists . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ... Maker ? " <p> " From the first moment I met you , " Lucien admitted quietly . " Your song , your anhrefncathl drew me . Just like it drew Loki . Just like it will eventually draw the rest of the Elohim . Unless I teach you  --  " <p> " Forget it . No , " Dante said , throat tight , heart pounding out a furious rhythm . " Instead of pretending to be my friend , you shoulda told me the fucking truth ! Shoulda offered to teach me then . Now 's a little late . " <p> Pain prickled behind Dante 's eyes and suddenly it was as if he was looking through a shattered window as Lucien 's image fractured and multiplied . Alarm flickered across Lucien 's now diamond-faceted face . " Child ... ? " <p> Something abruptly shifted inside Dante , something long broken , carving into his mind with white light and molten pain . The world spun , the stars streaking the night with gossamer ribbons of light , and he felt himself falling , tumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp and slick and edged with whispers . <p> You wan na take her punishment , p'tit ? D'accord , take it if you so hellfire eager . <p> He 's quiet now . Take him down . <p> Little fucking psycho . <p> Pain wrenched Dante apart and his vision winked out in an explosion of incandescent light  --  <p> Wings rustled . <p> Dante tasted blood , pomegranate-tart and heady . Felt heated flesh against his cheek . He opened his eyes and looked up into Lucien 's shadowed face . He tried to remember where he was and why he was cradled in Lucien 's lap , held tight within his arms . Lucien 's wings curved forward and purple-tinged darkness folded around them , creating a warm shelter smelling of dark earth and green leaves , of wing musk . <p> " I was falling ... " Dante said , then stopped , uncertain . Or had that been a dream ? <p> " Shhh , mon fils . You 're safe . Rest . " Gold motes danced in Lucien 's dark eyes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voice pitched low . <p> Ice frosted the base of Dante 's spine . There were only two reasons Von would spike him full of dope . Migraine or ... <p> Another fucking seizure . <p> " No , mon ami . " The lingering taste of Lucien 's blood on Dante 's tongue , his lips , told him why red-hot pain was n't needling his joints and muscles , why he was n't sapped of strength . " Did you give me blood ? Or did I jump you ? " <p> A smile quirked up the corners of Lucien 's mouth . " I gave . " <p> " Merci , " Dante murmured . He felt Lucien gently tapping against their closed bond , urging him to reopen the link . Shaking his head , he pushed free of Lucien 's embrace . As he rolled to his knees , kneeling within the circle of Lucien 's wings , the where and why suddenly poured into his mind like water from a broken levee . <p> The cemetery . <p> I tried to keep you safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , like Loki . <p> Creawdwr . <p> Dante 's hands clenched into fists on his leather-clad thighs as his rage reignited . He met and held Lucien 's gleaming gaze . <p> To Von he sent , &lt; How long was I down ? Did we miss our flight &gt; <p> &lt; Only a few minutes . We 're good to go  --  if you still wanna. &gt; <p> &lt; I wanna. &gt; <p> Lucien 's wings swept back and folded behind him . He uncrossed his legs , rising to his feet in one smooth motion . " You are ill , Dante , and hurt . You need time to heal . " <p> Dante stood . " Do n't tell me what I need . " <p> A muscle ticked in Lucien 's jaw . " Let the past go . Cancel the tour and let me teach you what you need to keep safe . " <p> " No . " Dante turned and headed down the path , his fingernails biting into his palms . <p> " The Fallen will find you , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I 'm not with you to prevent it , they will bind you . " Dante paused on the path . Deep inside , wasps droned . " If they find me , they ai n't binding me , " he said , his voice low and taut . " They 're gon na hafta kill me . " <p> " Not if , Dante . When . " <p> " Peut-Otre que oui , peut-Otre que non . Same ending . " <p> " Not if I can help it . " <p> " You ai n't got a say , " Dante said , his throat almost too tight for speech . " And we 're done here . " He moved , racing down the path , the night streaking past in a blue-white ribbon , the smells of moss and weathered marble deep in his lungs . <p> A few moments later , astride Von 's Harley , his hands on the nomad 's hips , the wind cold against his face , Dante wondered if Lucien followed . Wondered if any of the Fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . <p> I hid you from others . Powerful others who would use you without mercy . <p> The Fallen will find you . And bind you . <p> No , they would n't . Not ever . Not unless they knew how to bind a corpse . <p> One way or another , he would be free  --  his life , his own . <p> Dante glanced up . The sky was empty but for stars and moon and pale streamers of clouds . Nothing winged above . Not that he could see . And the Harley 's deep-throated rumble swallowed any sound he might hear . <p> Like a rush of wings.Copyright 2009 by Adrian Phoenix <br> Continues ...
