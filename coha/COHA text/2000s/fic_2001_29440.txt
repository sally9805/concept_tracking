Fertile , Missouri July 1922 LILLIAN RUSSELL 'S DIED ! " Jill made the dramatic announcement and waited for her sister to comment . When Julie continued to wash the dishes and drop them in the rinse pan , she said , " All the wonderful women in the world are dying . First Nellie Bly and now Lillian . " " Where did you hear that ? " " Ruby May told me last night . Lillian was so beautiful , so elegant . All the men loved her . " Jill lifted her arms in a circling motion . " I 'm going to be just like her . " " You 'll have to grow some , " Julie said dryly . " She had quite a bosom . They were out to here . " Julie held her cupped , wet hands out six inches from her slender body . " And a tiny waist . " " Helped by a tight corset . " " She was beautiful " " And old enough to be your grandma . Dry the dishes while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hot rinse water , dried it and set it on the table . " The men who gave her diamonds must have liked a woman.with a big bust . Diamonds show up best lying on soft white flesh . " " Soft white flesh ? Glory be ! Well , do n't worry about it . You 've got a good start for a fifteen-year-old . " Julie slid a greasy skillet into the sudsy water . " Jack said they were like half an orange stuck up there . " Julie looked at her sister and frowned . " Why would Jack be making a remark about his sister 's breasts ? " " I asked him . " " Justine Jill Jones ! " Jill rolled her eyes on hearing her full name . " I hate it when you call me that . " " It 's the name Mama gave you . " " I 'll never know why she added Justine to it . " " She did n't . She added Jill . " " Kidsat school laugh about our names . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have named them Jericho and Jerusalem . " " And what did you say to that ? " " Nothing . Kathy Jacobs said she should 've named two of us Jenny and Jackass . " Jill giggled . Julie 's shoulders shook with silent laughter . It did n't bother her that all their names started with a J. She rather liked it . " I never asked Jack about my bosom , " Jill said after she placed a stack of clean plates on the shelf . " I asked him if the boys at school thought I was pretty . " " And what did he say ? " " He said ... oh , he was so mean ! " Jill flipped her long blond curls over her shoulder and tilted her freckled nose . " He said only the dumb ones thought I was pretty . He said my hair was like straw , my nose was so turned up he was surprised I did n't drown when it rained . " Julie laughed in spite of the serious look on her sister 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you were a raving beauty they 'd not admit it . " " That 's when he said my breasts were the size of a half an orange . " " It 's a pact made between brothers to tell their sisters that they are ugly as a mud fence even if they are as pretty as Mary Pickford . " " I hate brothers ! " " Mable Normand is pretty . " " She 's in Molly O at the Palace . I want to see it , but Papa said picture shows cost almost as much as a pair of stockings and I needed stockings more . " Jill sighed heavily . " Julie , Julie , guess what ? " Ten-year-old Jason came into the kitchen , letting the screen door slam behind him . He always shouted when he was excitedand at times when he was n't . Since their mother 's death four years before , Julie had become the person her brothers and sisters came to with news , hurts and needs . Jason stumbled onto the back porch , yanked open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door just in time to keep the shaggy brown dog , his constant companion , from following him . Besides being small for his age , Jason had been born with a deformed foot that made it necessary for him to wear a special shoe . " Julie , guess what ? " He was breathless . " Well , let me think for a minute . Is it something exciting ? " Jason nodded his head vigorously . " Land-a-livin ' ! I think I know ! Bananas are growing out of the old stump out by the wood-pile . " " Ah , Julie , you 're so silly sometimes . " Jason stood as tall as his slight frame allowed . His muddy shoes were firmly planted on the clean kitchen floor . " Ju-lie ! Look at his shoes ! " Jill sneered with sisterly disgust . " Shut up . " Jason turned on his sister . " Open your trap again and I wo n't tell ya ! " " What 's your news , Jason ? " Julie poured water from the teakettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that we 're havin ' a baseball game tonight . The Birches , the Humphreys , and Roy and Thad Taylor ... Justine . Maybe the Jacobses and Evan Johnson . He helped at the Humphreys ' today , though he ai n't expecting no payback . " " Who cares about him ? " Jill snorted . Jason knew he would get the full attention of his younger sister when he mentioned the Taylors . Jill had been eyeing both Roy and Thad Taylor even though Thad was Joe 's age . " Joe told me to get out the bags we use for bases . I hope mice ai n't chewed ' em up . " " Have n't , " Julie corrected . " When was it decided to have a ball game ? " She stopped working on the greasy skillet to give her full attention to her brother , who was inching toward the door , eager to be away . " I du n no . They 'll be done hayin ' by midafternoon . Pa said to tell ya they 'd noon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town this afternoon . We 'll have a light supper . " " Can I go ? " " No . You can help Jill watch Joy . " " That 's . . . girl work ! " Jason snorted . " Just right for a sissy-britches , " Jill said snippily and took a handful of forks from the rinse pan . " Shut up , Jus-tine ! " Jason drew out the hated name because he knew that it would irritate his sister . " You 're so dumb , you stink . I got ta go . " Julie grabbed a towel to dry her hands and went to the door to see Jason hurrying across the yard . " Jason , " she called . " Where 's Joy ? " " I du n no . " " Find her , please . She may have wandered off . " " Ah , Sis , I wanta go back . " " Honey , it 's a good mile to the Humphreys ' . " " I do n't care , " he shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told ya . Jumpin ' catfish ! Here comes Joy . She 's been in the mud . I ai n't touchin ' ' er . " Julie went out onto the back porch and looked at the small girl . The blond curls that she had dampened and brushed around her finger to form fat curls not two hours ago were speckled with mud , as was Joy 's face . Mud covered her feet and legs up to the cuffs of her drawers , which came to just below her knees . " Ah , Joy . You 're a mess . You ca n't come in the house like that . Go to the pump . I 'll come wash you off . " " I did n't mean to , Julie . " The child 's impish grin told her sister that she was not a bit sorry . " I 'll do it . " Jill leaped down the back steps . " Come on , stinkpot . " " I ai n't no stinkpot , Jus-tine . " Joy 's hero was Jason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jus-tine , Jus-tine , Just-tine , " she said again and again , then stuck her tongue out and wriggled it . Julie went back into the kitchen . At times her heart ached for Jason . He never complained about his foot , but she knew that he wished he could run like the other boys . Tonight at the ball game , he would bat and one of his older brothers would run the bases for him . She also wished that Jill would be kinder to him . The two were always hissing and snapping at each other like a dog and a cat . Julie was finishing up the dishes when Jill came in , dragging Joy by the hand . The screen door slammed shut behind them . " Here 's this good-for-nothin ' kid . I put her clothes in the tub on the porch . " Julie looked down at the small girl and shook her head . Joy 's nakedness did n't seem to bother her at all . " I do n't know what we 're going to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ya can shoot me . " Big solemn eyes looked up at Julie . " Shoot you ? Where in the world did you get an idea like that ? " " Joe said it to Papa . Papa said , I donno what to do with ya . ' Joe said , Shoot ' er . ' " " They were teasing . " " I 'm not so sure , " Jill said . " Come on , brat . We 'll get you some bloomers , unless you want the boys to see your bare behind . " " I do n't care , " Joy replied sassily . Julie rolled her eyes toward the ceiling . The name Joy was so right for the little one ; she was the joy of the family . Her hair was curly , her eyes large and blue as the sky . Bright as a new penny and precocious , she was in danger of being terribly spoiled by doting brothers and sisters . Julie put the kitchen in order . As she hung her apron on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tow , came through the kitchen on the way to the front porch . Julie went upstairs to the room she shared with her sisters and changed out of her dress into a white blouse with a drawstring neckline and a blue skirt . Julie knew herself for what she was : a strong , slim woman with clear skin , a wide mouth and the responsibility of raising her siblings weighing heavily on her shoulders . She looked at herself closely in the mirror as she braided , coiled and pinned her waist-length , wheat-colored hair to the back of her head . She had thought about getting a bob , but she feared what it would do to her already rather " unsteady " reputation . Her thick dark brows were slightly arched . Lashes , long and lush , framed light brown eyes that were both quiet and quick . Julie sighed . Nothing about her would cause a man to give her a second look . She was foolish , very foolish to dream that one would . With a wide-brimmed straw hat set squarely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she picked up the cloth bag she would use to carry home the few things she planned to get at the store . On the porch she paused to give last-minute instructions to Jill . " If I 'm not back by the time Papa and the boys get here , tell them I 'll be here by suppertime . Be nice , Joy , and pay mind to what your sister tells you . " " Do I have to ? " The little girl 's merry blue eyes twinkled up at Julie . " Yes , you little imp . " Julie smiled fondly at the child . " Come give me a kiss . " " Are you going to the library ? " Jill asked . " Is there something you need to return ? " " No . I 'd love to read The Trail of the Lonesome Pine and Girl of the Limberlost again . If they 're not in , get Ramona or Freckles or A Knight of the Cumberland . " " You 've read those books ... several times . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read something I know I 'll like . Old Miss Rothe made us read Ivanhoe and Lady of the Lake . She thought they were romantic . I thought they were boring ! " " Agnes Rothe is a good teacher . " " She 's an old maid ! Bet she 's old as Papa . " " She 's a good teacher even if she is old ! " Julie retorted as she left the shade of the porch , stepped out into the bright July sunlight and walked down the lane toward the road . Sidney ran out from under the porch to follow . " You ca n't go , Sidney . " Julie stopped and pointed a finger at the shaggy dog . " Why are n't you with Jason ? " " Jason did n't want him to go to the Humphreys ' , " Jill called . " Why not ? He always goes with Jason . " " There 's a kid over there that 's scared of him . The Humphreys have to keep their dog tied up . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't go to town . " She waited until the dog had settled down by the porch step before she was on her way again . Julie breathed in deeply ; the air was tinged with fresh-cut , sweet-smelling hay . Buttercups and broom clover grew along the edge of the lane . Bees buzzed amid wild honeysuckle . Beams of bright sunlight slanted down through the trees . The grove was alive with the cheeps and chirps and rustlings of the birds . A mockingbird scolded her from the high branch of a towering oak tree . The summer day was serene and beautiful . A pompous rooster was picking and scratching in the lane ahead . The chickens were confined to the chicken house only in the winter . The rest of the year they were as free as the wild birds to roam the farm wherever they wished . They never ventured far , however , from the security of the farmyard , where from dawn to dusk they could be found picking up grain , undigested tidbits from animal manure , grass and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rooster , upon finding a choice morsel , called his harem of hens with a " Tut , tut , tut , tut . " A couple of gullible fat hens came running , but there was nothing left for them . The rooster made a great show of being a good provider and strutted away . Having the fluffy white hens at his beck and call seemed to do great things for his ego . Julie had been born on this farm in the room across the hall from the parlor . She had walked the mile to town and the additional quarter mile through town to school from the time she was six years old . Living on the edge of town , she had been considered a country girl and had not been invited to the socials held by her classmates , even though she had been a favorite of the teachers and was one of the prettiest girls in school . Her school days had come to an abrupt end the summer she was fifteen . She tried hard not to think of that terrible summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and her mother , who had never fully recovered from influenza . As she walked along the hard-packed road , Julie 's mind roamed . Like all young girls , she had dreamed of a handsome man who would fall madly in love with her and take her away . The dream was becoming dimmer and dimmer . Besides , the chance of finding such a man in Fertile , Missouri , was about as likely as waking up some morning and finding the sun coming up out of the west . Was her lot to be the old-maid sister living out her life here on the farm ? The boys would leave , marry and start families of their own . Jill was so pretty , she 'd have no trouble finding a husband . Already the boys were eyeing her , even if Jack would n't tell her so . He 'd told Julie he 'd punched one boy in the nose for talking about Jill 's bosom . Julie walked the downhill road toward town and the river beyond . It was easy walking . Coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . She rounded a curve in the road and the town of Fertile , a huddle of buildings scattered along the bank of the Platte River , came into view . Only the tall red-painted grain elevator and two white church steeples rose above the two-story brick shops and the wooden residences . The town sloped down to the river where the old mill stood . It had stopped operation several years before the Great War . Julie crossed the railroad tracks . The train station was a one-room frame boxlike structure with a cattle pen on one side and the elevator on the other . The grass alongside the tracks was charred , deliberately burnt to keep the weeds from taking over . A lumber wagon , its long box filled with large rolls of barbed-wire fencing and oak posts , rumbled past her and continued on down Main Street after the driver had tipped his hat politely . A Ford , rattling as if it were going to shake to pieces , rolled past and came to a stop in front of the drugstore , a building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In front of the shop was a large wooden clock that for as long as Julie could remember had n't run . A few automobiles were parked on the streets surrounding the county courthouse . Most merchants set aside an area for teams and wagons behind their stores . Fertile had a large and prosperous business area because it was the only town of any size in the county . The nearest large town was St. Joseph thirty miles to the west . Behind the shops that lined the street sat neat cottages and some large comfortable houses surrounded by picket fences . Closer to the river , in the less prosperous part of town , the houses were unkempt , unpainted frame shacks , most with a cow or a horse staked out behind them . Julie felt uncomfortable and out of place every time she walked alone down the main street of Fertile . A certain element of the population drew a discriminatory line between town people who " belonged " and those who lived on the surrounding farms and did not . Next to the Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , the largest mercantile store in town . A clear glass window , installed just this year , displayed dresses and men 's suits on mannequins that reminded Julie of corpses with painted faces . " Good afternoon , ma'am . May I help you ? " Scott Graham , who stepped from behind the counter , wore his hair parted in the middle and slicked down , a high stiff collar and blue arm garters on his starched white shirt . Scott had been in Julie 's class at school , but he never acknowledged that he knew who she was . Had she known that he would be the one to wait on her , she would not have come in . " What can I do for you ? " " I need two spools of number fifty white thread . " " Right this way . " Her head held high , Julie followed him down the aisle as if she intended to buy out the store instead of two five-cent spools of thread . Scott opened a drawer on the thread cabinet and selected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to look at the dress goods , please . " " This way , " he said , as if she could n't see the bolts of material piled on the table not six feet away . Julie selected a blue and white check to make a new Sunday dress for Joy , who had outgrown the only one she had , and a length of white lawn to sew a new shirtwaist for Jill . She paid for her purchases and left the store , glad to leave the presence of the dandy who had waited on her . When she passed the hotel , she glanced at a man sitting on the porch , his chair tilted back against the wall . His shirtsleeves were cuffless and he wore black arm garters , a linen collar but no tie . Their eyes met ; his , friendly and appraising . He smiled and tipped his broad-brimmed hat . She felt his eyes follow her as she walked down the street to the grocery store . She was greeted by name by the owner . The Joneses were valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him since he had come to town ten years ago and always paid their tab on time . " Good day to ya , Miss Jones . Nice day for a walk into town , huh ? " " It was nice walking in , but I do n't expect it to be so pleasant going back up the hill . How are the family ? " " Fit as fiddles . Little ones are growing like weeds . Wish they 'd hurry up so they can give me some help here in the store . " He laughed heartily . " Do n't wish your life away , Mr. Oakley . They will grow up fast enough . " " You 're right as rain ' bout that . Jethro finished with hayin ' ? " " They 'll finish this afternoon . If we get some rain we should have a couple more cuttings before frost . " " It 's been a good growin ' year so far . Your corn looks good . Me'n the missus passed the field last Sunday when we drove out to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in early . " " What can I get for you today ? " " I 'm walking , so I 'll just take a couple of things I can carry . Joe or Papa will be coming in with the wagon and a list in a few days . I need a can of baking powder and a small bottle of vanilla flavoring to get me by until then . " Julie waited while Mr. Oakley went to the back of the store . Her eyes roamed the neatly stocked shelves , the barrels of crackers , beans and rice and the bright red , big-wheeled coffee grinder that sat proudly on the counter . She breathed in the mixture of scents : coffee , spices , leather goods and overripe bananas . The pucker-mouthed wife of the blacksmith waddled into the store , paused to look around , then greeted Julie . " Ai n't seen ya at church lately , Julie , " she said in an accusing tone . " I 've been there almost every Sunday , Mrs. Yerby . " " I meant durin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revival meetin 's . " " I 'm glad to hear it . " Julie turned to Mr. Oakley and noticed the jar of peppermint sticks on the counter . " I 'll take a half dozen sticks of peppermint . The kids need a treat once in a while . " As she placed them in her cloth bag , the grocer pulled a thick ledger from beneath the counter , thumbed through the pages to the Jones account and added the purchases . " Thank you , " Julie murmured , then said more loudly , " Nice seeing you , Mrs. Yerby . " " Come to the revival , Julie . Ya just might meet a man lookin ' for a wife . Ya ai n't never goin ' to get one jist stayin ' out there on the farm takin ' care of them kids . " Julie laughed nervously . " I 'm not looking for a man , Mrs. Yerby . " " Pshaw ! Ai n't a woman alive who ai n't lookin ' for a man . Yo 're better-lookin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said dryly . " Ya wo n't have no trouble a-tall if ya just spruce up and show yoreself some . That 's if ya 've not got yore sights set on one of them good-looking rich fellers like that William Desmond Taylor that got himself murdered out there in Hollywood . " Mrs. Yerby 's laugh was more of a dry cackle . Embarrassed , Julie angrily turned and adjusted the items in her bag . Mrs. Yerby did n't seem to notice that she had made Julie uncomfortable and continued in a confidential tone . " They ai n't found out who killed him yet . I heard a feller say it on the radio . Bet it was that oh-so-pure Mary Miles Minter . Pshaw ! Pure , my foot . Ai n't nothin ' pure in that wicked place . " Mrs. Yerby picked a raisin from the barrel and popped it quickly into her mouth when she saw Mr. Oakley was n't looking . It did n't stop her from talking . " That awful Johnson man came to the meetin ' the other night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told ' em that they ai n't ort to hold services in the pavilion with the sides raised up so that hill trash like Walter Johnson can see what 's goin ' on . But they went right ahead and done it , and look what they got . " " Did he disrupt the service ? " Mr. Oakley asked . " He was drinkin ' and quarrelsome . When church was over he tried to pick a fight with Stan Decker . He called him a blank-blank hypocrite , but out of respect for the church Stan just walked off and left him . That Johnson is the meanest man I ever did see . He 's too mean to live , is what he is . A person can see the devil right in him . " " I must go , " Julie said . To the shopkeeper she added , " Tell Mrs. Oakley I 'm sorry I missed her . " " Ya better watch that little sister of yores , Julie . " Mrs. Yerby lowered her voice . " It 's said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't put it past him to waylay her out in the woods someplace and have his way with her . Now that his boy is back , there 's two of ' em . I heard there 's a girl down in Well 's Point that was sent away sudden-like . " " Thanks for the warning , Mrs. Yerby . " Julie stepped out into the bright sunlight . She did n't want to hear anything more about the town bully or his son . Her intense hatred of the man could be the one thing that would keep her out of heaven . She could n't remember when she had n't hated and feared him .
