No , it 's not like the days of Che Guevara , where you sat around a campfire in the jungle playing the guitar , " says Carlos Castano , laughing . He is probably the most feared  --  and elusive  --  man in Colombia . " Even in the jungle , I have the Internet and mobile phones . Why , the other night I watched a Kevin Costner movie , Message in a Bottle , on satellite TV . " Since 1996 Castano has seized control of hundreds of small private armies recruited by Colombia 's druglords , industrialists and owners of the big cattle ranches and emerald mines . These vigilantes were little better than death squads . Castano consolidated these armies into his United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( AUC ) , which today is pursuing its self-appointed mission : to exterminate the country 's leftist rebels who have pinned the government down in a 36-year war . Castano has learned to hit the rebels where it hurts : he goes after their drug profits . <P> Castano and his paramilitaries are basically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at times they are staunchly antigovernment  --  particularly when Colombia 's leaders try to pursue peace instead of war . Castano also has ties to the region 's drug dealers . But though he profits from their work , he is quick to say he hopes for a Colombia free of a narco economy . <P> Castano , 35 , has seen a lot of Colombian jungle . It has been five years since he last set foot in a town , seven years since he took his wife and two kids to visit his favorite country , the U.S. , where they toured Disney World , with the full knowledge of U.S. officials . In 1993 Castano and his late brother Fidel reportedly did antidrug authorities the great favor of helping police hunt down Pablo Escobar , leader of the powerful Medellin cartel . <P> Since then , Castano , who wears camouflage fatigues and moves with the predatory restlessness of a jungle cat , has been stalking the two chief rebel groups : the 16,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) and the smaller but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 5,000 fighters . His AUC members , who look as though they were outfitted from the back pages of Soldier of Fortune magazine , number 8,000 . They operate in 25% of Colombian territory , mainly in the north , along the Venezuelan border and in the central Magdalena River valley . But in the past month , AUC forces pushed deep into the southern Putumayo zone , challenging the FARC 's dominance over 150,000 acres of coca plantations  --  which produce more than half the U.S. 's annual intake of cocaine from Colombia . <P> The AUC is proving more lethal against the guerrillas than the Colombian army for one simple reason : Castano 's men do n't fret too much over human rights . " We copy the methods of our enemy , " says Castano grimly . A government ombudsman says the AUC has massacred more than 794 people this year , mostly small farmers . Castano insists that nearly all were guerrilla spies . <P> Obsessed with secrecy , Castano has given only a handful of press interviews and refused until recently to have his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a muddy drive through banana plantations and finally a speedboat ride through a thunderstorm across the Gulf of Uruba to the Darien Gap , the mountainous rain forest separating Colombia from Panama . Castano was waiting on the beach , surrounded by 30 hulking paramilitaries hidden among giant ceiba trees .
