Deep mid-August in the New Orleans heat . Not even much traffic a block away on North Claiborne , a Saturday afternoon , and the sound of SJ 's hammer going in the stupefying thick air . SJ was almost finished framing the new shed he was building in his backyard . Wiring and Sheetrocking would be for after Labor Day . Way off in the distance , past the Industrial Canal and the reaches of the Upper Ninth Ward and the Bywater , the skyscrapers of downtown and the iridescent blister of the Superdome roof lay naked under the brilliant sun . <p> Out front , SJ 's truck and his van sat in the curved cement driveway he had laid in front of his house ( he had moved the structure back seven feet to make room for that driveway ) , with the magnetic sign on the door  --  New Breed Carpentry and Repair , and his phone number . It had been cheaper than getting it stenciled on the door itself , and it worked fine , he got calls off of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script on the front fender , the way the taxi drivers did , for an extra touch of distinction . Most of his work came from out in New Orleans East , a sprawling area of new houses and curving , landscaped streets in the subdivisions , reclaimed from swampland in the 1970s , where he could certainly have moved , if money were the only question and he had wanted to leave the Lower Ninth , which he did n't . <p> SJ 's father had built his own house in a vacant lot on North Miro Street , five blocks away , when he came back from World War II , with two-by-fours and weatherboard and nails that he salvaged from all around and saved up by his mama 's house . He pulled the nails out of scrap wood , carefully , or found them on the ground , and sometimes even straightened them if they could be straightened , one nail at a time . He kept them in what his mother called put-up jars , sorted roughly by size and thickness and purpose . SJ had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gone , and he rented it out to a widow lady . Sometimes when he wanted to get off by himself he would walk those five blocks to the old house and sit on the side steps and think . <p> He hammered some finishing nails into a line across the bottom of a small French cornice . He was trying something different with this shed , which he had seen in one of the books his daughter , Camille , sent him from North Carolina , something a little more decorative in a different way , not just utilitarian . His thin , ribbed undershirt , with thin straps over his shoulder , was soaked through with sweat , which glistened on his shaved head , shoulders and upper arms . Around his neck on a thin chain hung a St. Christopher medal . In his mid-fifties , SJ was still a powerful , compact man . He loved to build things , to work with his hands , and he loved to cook , especially outside , and he liked to read . After Rosetta , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had read less and built more . <p> He would finish the line he was working on and then stop for the day and get some food going . He would go out to find Wesley later if he could ; he had left his nephew to finish up a part of the job the day before and Wesley had left the tools sitting outside and SJ had come out in the morning to find them slick with overnight wet . He had wiped them down and put them in the oven to sweat them out , but he did n't understand that carelessness at all . His nephew was a smart young man , nineteen years old and teetering on the edge of some-thing anyone in the Lower Nine knew all too well . Lately he had been riding around at night on these motorcycles where you had to hunch way over , weaving in and out of stopped traffic . Where he got the money for the bike SJ did n't know and Lucy , SJ 's sister , would not say . At least , SJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working with your hands kept you focused on the real world . Still , you could hit a pothole on of those bikes and end up in a wheelchair for life . <p> Two weeks earlier the police arrested Wesley for beating on his girlfriend . SJ had drilled into his nephew many times the importance of surviving the encounter with police when you had one . Wesley had a quick mouth and a mannish attitude , but he had done allright , at least he had n't gotten the police mad , and SJ got the call from the jail at 3:30 in the morning and SJ and Lucy had to go down and get him out on bond and later on SJ had demanded an accounting from his nephew . <p> " Uncle J she slap me and I did n't hit her . I 'm not lying . " They were sitting in SJ 's living room , the sky just getting light outside . Wesley had on jeans with the crotch halfway down to his knees , and an oversize T-shirt hanging out , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His reddish skin seemed to be breaking out , and his hair was uneven and untended . " Then she slap me again and called me a pussy . What I 'm supposed to do ? " <p> " Walk out the room , nephew . You already paying for another man 's baby . How she going to respect you ? You need to find a woman who gon na watch your back and not put a knife in it . It does n't matter how good that pussy is , you got to stay alive . " <p> Wesley looked up at his uncle then , sly smile , the charming look , " It is good , Uncle J. " <p> SJ allowed himself a small laugh . He knew as well as anyone . He remembered one of the old blues records his father liked to play , something about " Some people say she 's no good , but she 's allright with me .
