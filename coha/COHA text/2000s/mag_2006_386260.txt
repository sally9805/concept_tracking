. For many of us , Norfolk , Va. , is almost a rite of passage , part of an annual migration . It helps if the boat works . I HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF NORFOLK , VA. , AND ENVIRONS , HAVING PASSED THROUGH THERE , and stayed there , many times over the years . I 'm certainly not alone here . For thousands of boat owners , Norfolk is a popular spot ( see our Local Knowledge column this month ) , largely because it 's ground zero for the Intracoastal Waterway , the start of the mile markers that snowbirds use to migrate down to Florida each fall , and then to return , watching the numbers retreat back to zero again , in the spring . Norfolk 's a great place for a crew change , with an airport near town , a nice city to visit in its own right , and a protected spot to wait out the weather or decide whether to continue cruising outside , in the Atlantic , or inside , up the Chesapeake or down the Waterway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Dan Fales , our expert-at-large , and Bill Hubbard , an old friend of mine who then owned a classic wooden powerboat named Daisy , after his wife ( her name is Robin , but that 's another story ) , and I were delivering a new 40-foot cruiser from Florida to Connecticut . Bill and I had flown into Charleston , S.C. , from New York late on a Friday night to meet Dan and the boat for a crew change . Early the next morning ( our usual pre-dawn departure ) we headed outside , into the ocean and normal three-foot or so swells . Dan and I were settling into our happy bluewater cruising zone when Bill became increasingly uneasy . " Does it always pound like this ? " he asked . Well no , we answered . Usually it 's a lot worse . And we drifted off again . That evening , however , when we pulled in somewhere in the Carolinas to spend the night , we realized that things were in fact a lot worse , because we did n't have reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Dan 's turn at the helm , and he actually did a masterful job of docking a twin-screw 40-footer on one engine , which was particularly fortunate since the docks were crowded with some kind of fishing tournament at the time and we had the magazine 's logo painted on the side of the boat . In any event , we limped into Norfolk the next day , tied up the boat at one of the large marinas there to await repairs and called a cab to take us to the airport . This was not our lucky day , because the cab almost immediately broke down in the middle of the tunnel leading away from the marina , stranding us again . This was the only time I 've ever broken down on the water and on land in the same trip . ( Later on , we picked up the boat , with both reverse gears working , and enjoyed it greatly for the rest of the summer . ) But Norfolk is fun . As a history buff , I particularly enjoy a side trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounce around in the Atlantic to get there . BOX About a year ago , BEN BROWN , a young man with great ideas , lots of ambition and a tremendous personality , started working for us as an intern . He had just changed majors at Fordham as a senior ; he wanted to be a journalist . Ben started out where we all did ; making phone calls , rounding up pictures , helping out , gathering all the details that go into the making of a magazine . After a while , he moved on to writing shorts and then department pages , earning some bylines . The best part of Ben was that he made us smile ; he was fun to be around . Ben started out as a colleague ; he ended up as a friend . Ben graduated from Fordham this spring and we saw much more of him here . On a Saturday night this summer , Ben was crossing West 57th Street in New York when he was hit by a car and killed . Police charged the driver with drunk driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
