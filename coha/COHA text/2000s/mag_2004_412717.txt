A STORY OF LOVE AND NOT WANTING A BABY Photograph // It happened like this ; After a walk in the park with a friend , I saw a young woman sitting in a car talking to a dog . Even from a distance , beneath the hard glass of the windshield , we could tell this was an exceptional animal . Never shy , I tapped on the young woman 's door to ask her what kind of dog it was . We live in Nashville , where people do things like this and no one is frightened or surprised . The young woman told us the sad story : The dog , who on closer viewing was nothing but a mere slip of a puppy , had been dumped in a parking lot , rescued , and then passed among several well-intentioned young women , none of whom were allowed to have dogs in their apartments . Finally the dog had landed with the young woman in the car , who had been explaining to said dog that the day had come to look cute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white . The sun came through her disproportionately large ears and showed them to be pink and translucent as a good Limoges cup held up to the light . We petted . She licked . We left the park with a dog . I did n't think it would be this way . I thought when the time was right I would make a decision , consider breeds , look around . The truth is , I too was a woman who lived in an apartment that did n't accept dogs . But when fate knocks on the door , you 'd better answer . " Let 's call her Rose , " my boyfriend said . I was breathless , besotted . My puppy tucked her nose under my arm and the hundred clever dog names I had dreamed up over a lifetime vanished . " Sure , " I said . " Rose . " I was 32 years old that spring , and all I had ever wanted was a dog . While other girls grew up dreaming of homes and children , true love and financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , bounding mutts . Part of my childhood was spent on a farm where I lived in a sea of pets : horses and chickens , a half a dozen sturdy , mouse-killing cats , rabbits , one pig , and many , many dogs , Rumble and Tumble and Sam and Lucy and especially Cuddles , who did justice to his name . Ever since that time I have believed that happiness and true adulthood would be mine at the moment of dog ownership . I would stop traveling so much . I would live someplace with a nice lawn . There would be plenty of money for vet bills . At home , the puppy , Rose , played with balls , struggled with the stairs , and slept behind my knees while I watched in adoration . It 's not that I was unhappy in what I now think of as " the dogless years , " but I suspected things could be better . What I never could have imagined was how much better they would be . I had entered into my first relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicer apartment , one that allowed dogs for a ridiculously large , nonrefundable pet deposit . Since I work at home , Rose was able to spend her days in my lap , where she was most comfortable . We bonded in a way that some people looked upon as suspicious . I took Rose into stores like the rich ladies at Bergdorf 's do . I took her to dinner parties . I took her to the Cape for vacation . As I have almost no ability to leave her alone , when I had to go someplace that foolishly did not allow dogs , I 'd drive her across town and leave her with my grandmother . " Look at that , " people said , looking at me and not Rose . " Look how badly she wants a baby . " A baby ? I held up my dog for them to see , my bright , beautiful dog . " A dog , " I said . " I 've always wanted a dog . " In truth , I have no memory of ever wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's stroller . I have , on occasions too numerous to list , bent down on the sidewalk to rub the ears of strange dogs , to whisper to them about their limpid eyes . " Maybe you do n't even realize it , " strangers said , friends said , my family said . " Clearly , you want a baby . " " Look at the way you 're holding that dog , " my grandmother said . " Just like it 's a baby . " People began to raise the issue with my boyfriend , insisting that he open his eyes to the pathetic state of maternal want I was so clearly in . Being a very accommodating fellow , he took my hand . With his other hand he rubbed Rose 's ears . He loves her as blindly as I do . Her favorite game is to be draped over the back of his neck like a foxfur stole , two legs dangling on either shoulder . " Ann , " he said . " If you want to have a baby ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a baby and a puppy and see there are some very marked differences ? You ca n't leave babies at home alone with a chew toy when you go to the movies . Babies will not shimmy under the covers to sleep on your feet when you 're cold . Babies , for all their many unarguable charms , will not run with you in the park , wait by the door for you to return , and , as far as I can tell , know absolutely nothing of unconditional love . Being a childless woman of child-bearing age , I am a walking target for people 's concerned analysis . No one looks at a single man with a Labrador Retriever and says , " Will you look at the way he throws the tennis ball to that dog ? Now , there 's a guy who wants to have a son . " A dog , after all , is man 's best friend , a comrade , a buddy . But give a dog to a woman without children and people will say she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't want children , they will nod understandingly and say , " You just wait . " For the record , I do not speak to my dog in baby talk , nor do I , when calling her , say , " Come to Mama . " " You were always my most normal friend , " my friend Elizabeth told me , " until you got this dog . " While I think I would have enjoyed the company of many different dogs , I believe that the depth of my feeling for Rose in particular comes from the fact that she is , in matters of intelligence , loyalty and affection , an extraordinary animal . In the evenings , I drive Rose across town to a large open field where people come together to let their dogs off their leashes and play . As she bounds through the grass with the Great Danes and the Bernese Mountain Dogs , I believe that there was never a dog so popular and well adjusted as mine ( and yet realize at the same time that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other dog owners want to talk about identifying her lineage , perhaps in hopes that one of her cousins might be located . It is not enough for Rose to be a good dog . She must be a particular breed of dog . She has been , depending on how one holds her in the light , a small Jack Russell , a large Chihuahua , a Rat Terrier , a Fox Terrier and a Corgi with legs . At present , she is a Portuguese Podengo , a dog that to the best of my knowledge was previously unknown in Tennessee . It is the picture she most closely resembles in our International Encyclopedia of Dogs . We now say things like " Where is the Podengo ? " and " Has the Podengo been outside yet ? " to give her a sense of heritage . In truth , she is a Parking Lot Dog , dropped off in a snowstorm to meet her fate . I watch the other dog owners in the park , married people and single people and people with children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very personal and distinct . But what I see again and again is that people are proud of their pets , proud of the way that they run , proud of how they nose around with the other dogs , proud that they are brave enough to go into the water or smart enough to stay out of it . People seem able to love their dogs with an unabashed acceptance that they rarely demonstrate with family or friends . The dogs do not disappoint them , or if they do , the owners manage to forget about it quickly . I want to learn to love like this , the way we love our dogs , with pride and enthusiasm and a complete amnesia for faults . In short , to love others the way our dogs love us . Photograph // When a dog devotes so much of herself to your happiness , it only stands to reason you would want to make that dog happy in return . Things that would seem unreasonably extravagant for yourself are nothing less than a necessity for your dog . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had dreams of obedience , of sit and stay and come , maybe a few simple tricks . She did n't really seem big enough to drag the paper inside . I was nervous about finding the right trainer and called my friend Erica for moral support , but she was too busy going on interviews to get her four-year-old son into a top Manhattan preschool to be too sympathetic . The trainer we went with was the very embodiment of dog authority figures . After a few minutes of pleasant conversation in which Rose jumped on his shoulder and licked the top of his head , he laid out the beginnings of his plan . Number one : The dog does n't get on the furniture . We blinked . We smiled nervously . " But she likes the furniture , " we said . " We like her on the furniture . " He explained to us the basic principles of dog training . She has to learn to listen . She must learn parameters and the concept of no . He tied a piece of cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yank her off the sofa cushion with a sharp tug . Our dog went flying through the air . She looked up at us from the floor , more bewildered than offended . " She does n't sleep with you , does she ? " the trainer asked . " Sure , " I said , reaching down to rub her neck reassuringly . She slept under the covers , her head on my pillow , her muzzle on my shoulder . " What 's the point of having a twelve-pound dog if she does n't sleep with you ? " He made a note in a folder . " You 'll have to stop that . " I considered this for all of five seconds . " No , " I said . " I 'll do anything else , but the dog sleeps with me . " After some back-and-forth on this subject , he relented , making it clear that it was against his better judgment . For the duration of the ten-week program , either I sat on the floor with Rose or we stayed in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch . I went to see my friend Warren , who , handily , is also a psychologist , to ask him if he thought things had gotten out of hand . Maybe I have a obsessive-compulsive disorder concerning my dog . " You have to be doing something to be obsessive-compulsive , " he said . " Are you washing her all the time ? Or do you think about washing her all the time ? " I shook my head . " It could be codependency , then . Animals are by nature very codependent . " I was n't sure I liked this . Codependency felt too trendy . Warren 's sixteen-year-old daughter , Kate , came in , and I asked her if she wanted to see the studio portraits I had taken of Rose for my Christmas cards . She studied the pictures from my wallet for a minute and then handed them back to me . " Gee , " she said . " You really want to have a baby , do n't you ? " I went home to my dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've had Rose a year now , and there has never been a cold and rainy night when I 've resented having to take her outside . I have never wished I did n't have a dog , while she sniffed at each individual blade of grass , even as my hands were freezing up around the leash . I imagine there are people out there who got a dog when what they wanted was a baby , but I wonder if there are n't other people who had a baby when all they really needed was a dog .

The way the tall man bent to the sweet little boy at his side , the tenderness in his gesture as he adjusted the child 's hat and straightened his tweed coat brought a sting of unexpected tears to her eyes . <p> The child said something , and the man squatted to eye level , took the boy 's chin between long fingers and smiled as he answered . Even from where she stood , Emma could see strong and assuring depths in his dark eyes . Then he straightened , his expression determined , and stared across the street . <p> Emma ducked , afraid he 'd notice her interest and think her unduly curious . But she could n't resist a guarded look at the pair . <p> The boy took the man 's hand . The man picked up a battered suitcase and they continued on . <p> Emma 's throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ache as wide as the Dakota prairies sucked at her thoughts . Just a few steps away , across the wind-swept , dusty street , stood the embodiment of all she longed for  --  a strong , caring man and a dear little child . She mentally shook herself . Although it was not to be , she had no reason to begrudge the fact . She loved being a nurse . She loved helping people . Most of all , she had a responsibility to her parents and brother , struggling to survive the drought and Depression on the farm back home . They depended on the money she sent from her wages each month . She thought of her brother , Sid , and drew in a steadying breath to stop a shiver of guilt . She waited for her lungs to ease and let her usually buried dreams subside into wispy clouds she knew would drift across her thoughts from time to time , like the straw-colored autumn leaves skittering past her feet . <p> The pair turned in at Ada Adams 's boardinghouse and stopped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . She smiled at the way the boy glanced at the man to see if he imitated the stance correctly . <p> The door opened . Gray-haired Ada reached out and hugged them each in turn , then drew them inside . <p> Emma gasped and halted her journey toward the boardinghouse . This must be the nephew  --  a widower  --  Ada expected . Somehow Emma anticipated an older man with a much older son . Truthfully , Emma had paid little attention when Ada made the announcement of their impending arrival . She 'd simply been relieved Ada finally decided to get help running the house . The work was far too much for the older woman , suffering from arthritis . Now Emma wished she 'd thought to have asked some questions . How old was the man ? How old his son ? How long was he staying ? What had Ada said happened to his wife ? Ada might have answered all her questions but Emma had been dashing out the door and had n't stopped to listen to the whole story . <p> Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair . She glanced at her sturdy white shoes . Her white uniform revealed the evidence of a hard day at the hospital . The weather had been cool when she left before dawn and she 'd worn her woolen cape , but now the sun shone warmly and she carried her cape over her arm . <p> She needed a few minutes to collect her thoughts and seek a solution to this sudden yearning . Rather than cross to the boardinghouse , she continued along the sidewalk with no destination in mind , simply the need to think in solitude . <p> She passed yards enclosed by picket fences . Mr. Blake fussed about his flower beds , preparing them to survive a bitter South Dakota winter . She called a greeting and he waved . <p> Praying silently , she circled the block . Lord , God , You know the road before me . You know I do n't resent my responsibility . In fact , I am grateful as can be for this job and the chance to help my parents . It 's only occasionally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those times . I thought I had dealt with my disappointment and buried my dreams , but it seems they do n't have the decency to stay dead and buried . Yet I will not fret about it . I know You will give me the strength to do what I must . In Thee do I rejoice . Blessed be Your name . <p> A smile curved her lips as peace flooded her heart . She knew what she had to do , how she had to face the future , and she would gladly do it . <p> Her resolve restored , she walked back to the boardinghouse . Only for a second did her feet falter as she remembered Ada 's nephew 's dark eyes and the way he smiled at his small son . A tiny sound of disgust escaped her lips . She was n't one to let fanciful notions fill her head . No . She was the kind to do what had to be done . No one and nothing would divert her from her responsibilities . She tipped her thoughts back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might prove prudent to avoid as much contact with the nephew as possible . Certainly they would sit around the same table for meals but apart from that <p> She suddenly chuckled . The man might be unbearably rude or snobbish , even if in those few moments as he encouraged his son , he 'd touched her heart . <p> Her smile flattened . Rogue or otherwise , she need n't worry . He 'd probably not even notice her . She was no china doll . Her eyes should have been blue to go with her blond hair . Instead she had dark brown eyes , equally dark lashes and brows . Too often people gave her a strange look as if startled by the contrast . She 'd been told many times it gave her a look of determination  --  a woman more suited for work than romance . Yet <p> She pushed away useless dreams , straightened her shoulders and stepped into the warm house . <p> She thought of slipping up the stairs to change , but she would only be avoiding the inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Besides , despite the rumpled state of her uniform , wearing it made her feel strong and competent . A glance in the hall mirror , a tuck of some loose strands of hair into her thick bun and she headed into the kitchen . <p> He stood with his back to her . He 'd shed his coat . He was thin as were many people after years of drought and Depression prices . His shoulders were wide and square , and he was even taller than she 'd thought  --  six foot or better , if she did n't miss her guess . His hair was brown as a warm mink coat . <p> She blamed the hot cookstove for the way her cheeks stung with heat . <p> Ada leaned to the right so she could see past her nephew . " Emma , I told you my nephew , Boothe , was coming . " <p> The man faced her . His eyes were n't dark as she first thought ; they only appeared so because they were deep-set and gray as a winter sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any blizzard she 'd ever experienced . <p> " Boothe Wallace . " Ada 's voice came like a faint call on a breeze as Emma 's emotions ran the gamut of longing , loneliness and finally into self-disgust that she could n't better control her thoughts . <p> " Boothe , this is one of my guests , Emma Spencer . " <p> Emma , her feelings firmly under control , stepped forward but halted as his expression grew forbidding . <p> His gaze raced over her uniform , pausing at the blotch where she 'd tried to erase evidence of a young patient 's vomit . <p> She wished she 'd taken the time to change . " I 'm sorry , " she murmured , forcing the words past the blockage in her throat . " I just got off work . " <p> " A nurse . " Boothe 's words carried a condemning tone , though Emma could think of no reason for it . She 'd given him no cause to object to anything she 'd done or not done . <p> " She works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little fellow is Boothe 's son , Jessie . " <p> Boothe showed no sign of moving over to allow Emma to meet the boy , so she stepped sideways . Jessie perched on the table . He gave her a shy , glancing smile , allowing her a glimpse of startlingly blue eyes . She wanted to sweep the adorable child into her arms . She wisely restrained herself . She loved working with children best . Her superiors praised her rapport with them . <p> The boy wore an almost new shirt of fine cotton and knickers of good quality wool . Compared to his father 's well-worn clothes , Jessie was dressed like a prince . <p> " I 'm happy to meet you , Jessie , " she said in the soft tone she reserved for children and frightened patients . " How old are you ? " <p> He darted another glance at her and smiled so wide she ached to ruffle his sandy-colored hair . " Six . " His voice had a gritty sound as if he wanted everyone to forget he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's when she saw the deep slash on his arm and the blood-soaked rag that had recently been removed . " You 've been hurt . What happened ? " Instinctively , she stepped forward , intent on examining the wound . <p> " Ran into a sticking out nail . Daddy got really mad at the man pushing the cart . " He gave the cut a look , shuddered and turned away , but not before she got a glimpse of his tears . The wound had to hurt like fury . It was deep and gaping , but a few stitches would fix it up and he 'd heal neatly as long as he did n't get an infection  --  and unless it was properly cleaned , he stood a good chance of just that . Dirt blackened the edges of the cut . " I 'll clean it for you , and then your father can take you to the doctor . " <p> But before she reached Jessie 's side , Boothe stepped in front of her . <p> " No doctor . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma 's spine . " I 'll take care of him myself . " His stubborn stance was a marked contrast to the tenderness he 'd exhibited a short time ago on the street . <p> She thought she must have misunderstood him . " It needs cleaning and stitching . I can do the former but a good doctor should do the latter . " Again she moved to take over the chore . <p> Again he blocked her . " I 'll be the one taking care of my son . " <p> The challenge in his eyes felt like a spear to her heart , but she would n't let it deter her . " Your son needs medical attention . " <p> " I do n't need the bungling interference of either a doctor or a nurse . " He 'd lowered his voice so only Emma heard him . <p> She recoiled from the venomous accusation . " I do not bungle . " <p> He held his hand toward her , palm forward , effectively forbidding her to go any farther . <p> She clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to hurt and clamped her mouth shut to stop the angry protest . How dare this man judge her incompetent ! But even more , how could he ignorantly , stubbornly , put his son at risk ? Too many times she 'd seen the sorry result of home remedies . She 'd seen children suffer needlessly because their parents refused to take them to the doctor until their injuries or illnesses pushed them to the verge of death . She shuddered , recalling some who came too late . <p> He turned back to his aunt . " Would you have a basin ? " <p> Ada 's eyes were wary as if wondering if she should intervene then she gave a barely perceptible shrug , pulled one from the cupboard and handed it to him . <p> Boothe 's demanding gaze forbade Emma to interfere . When he seemed confident she 'd stand back , he turned to his son . " Jessie , I 'm going to clean this and then I 'll bandage it . " <p> Boothe filled a basin as Emma helplessly looked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by when little Jessie sent her a frightened look as if begging her to promise everything would be okay . Unfortunately , she could n't give such assurance . The wound continued to bleed . One good thing about the flow of blood  --  it served to cleanse the deeper tissues . <p> Boothe dipped a clean cloth in the water . Jessie whimpered . " Now , son . I wo n't hurt you any more than I need to . You know that ? " <p> Jessie nodded and blinked back tears . <p> " You be a brave man and this will be done sooner than you know . " <p> Jessie pressed his lips together and nodded again . <p> Emma admired the little boy 's bravery . She watched with hawk-like concentration as Boothe cleaned the edges of the wound . He did a reasonably good job but it did n't satisfy Emma . She itched to pour on a good dose of disinfectant . Iodine was her first choice . She 'd never seen a wound infect if it 'd been properly doused with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion but Boothe 's warning glance made her swallow back the words . The boy would have a terrible scar without stitches , and the wound would keep bleeding for an unnecessarily long time . <p> " Aunt Ada , do you have a clean rag ? " Boothe asked . Ada handed him an old sheet . <p> No , Emma mentally screamed . At least use something sterile . " I could get dressings from the hospital , " she offered , ignoring his frown . <p> " This will do just fine . " He tore the fabric into strips . <p> Anger , like hot coals to her heart , surged through her . How could this man be so stubborn ? Why did he resist medical help with such blindness ? <p> Ignoring her , though he could n't help but be aware of her scowling concern , he pressed the edges of the wound together and wrapped it securely with the cloth , fixing the end in place with the pin Ada handed him then stepped back , pleased with his work . <br> Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
