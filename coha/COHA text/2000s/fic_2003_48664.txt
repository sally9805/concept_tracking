OKAY , SO I FOLLOWED HER , THE FIRST TIME . I spied on Little Twig 's crazy woman . Hands balled into flailing fists , she strode toward a shallow cove on the island 's undeveloped northern shore where a herd of skinny-legged herons stood transfixed . It was evening . On its way out , the sun was benevolent . The surface of the water was streaked in violet and gold . I watched the woman stand barefoot on the beach where the tide had deposited soggy trash . Her cotton dress was royal blue . Her feet were large , her jaw was square , her hands were angry . Her hair was a black tangle . Her skin was a shade darker than the tawny sand . She watched the graceful , silent birds with a rapt intensity that made me uncomfortable . I felt like a voyeur with a conscience . I sneaked away . <p> But I was a journalist , or had been . I was trained to pry . The next morning I asked my landlord about her . Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the Caribbean . But the family fire was quenched ; only Andy 's old-fashioned English was . piratical . He was mild , a fisherman who understood internal-combustion engines , a mechanic who understood the mood swings of the sea from which he pulled his living . <p> " Leave that one alone , why do n't you , " he told me. he was mending a net , draping it across the keel of a small wooden boat turned upside down on the sand . " Inocencia 's had a hard life . " <p> He shook out the section of net he was working on , took a smoke break . The sun was in his eyes . A yellow cat with black feet was trying to get his attention , rubbing its haunches against the legs of his bleached-out jeans . He kicked the animal away ; it landed next to a tiny heap of dead minnows . The cat pawed their bloated bellies for a moment before leaving the beach in the feline equivalent of disgust . Andy lit his pipe and told me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , I did . I was taking a break from my work . Until I quit it , my work had been my life . I wanted to find out what was left over when I subtracted my professional identity from who I was . For a long time I had been a reporter for the Rochester Chronicle . I started out in Managua covering the war between the Sandinistas and the Contras . Later , I covered the unification of the Germanys , American marines and Somali warlords , the genocide in Rwanda , some of the war in Chechnya , the unraveling of the idea of Indonesia . I disliked being described as a war correspondent , or even a foreign correspondent . I had my own , more accurate term for the work I did : insanity correspondent . That was what I did ; I traveled around the world documenting the limitless forms that madness took . And I was good at it . My work won prizes . The Chronicle was institutionally proud of the work I produced . <p> It was not correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped drinking the same week I had a heart-to-heart with my editor in Rochester and we both decided a change of status was called for . Even at my most sodden I was never a proficient drinker . Alcohol was not the reason for my decline ; it was only a personal metaphor . When I stopped , I did n't even miss it . <p> I wound up in the Bay Islands of Honduras because , in retrospect , the war in Central America seemed the most intimately human of the catastrophes I had reported on , and I nourished a strange nostalgia for the place . Also , on Little Twig the cost of living was absurdly low . Without effort I could stretch my money for as long as I wanted to stay . So I let myself be caught up in the island 's tangle : the salt litter of old boats and wood houses on stilts , cases of beer in brown bottles , and stacks of dry goods . Poinsettia plants the size of medium trees and garden patches of cassava . Mute , ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scattered thickets of poor people 's houses , fishing boats and tourist boats , swampy woods and sandy trails that petered out going nowhere , which was where I wanted to be . <p> The woman in New York with whom I had been trying to live thought I should be writing a book . Nicole was an editor at one of the big houses that had been bought by the Germans . She was generous . Even after it became clear to both of us that I was not constituted to live in an apartment in Manhattan and attend the parties that were an important form of self-expression for her , she offered to get me a contract to write about my overseas experiences . The advance would set me free , at least temporarily . <p> But I told Nicole no . I was not looking to reflect in print on the craziness I had covered ; I wanted something different . Ever since Managua I had carried with me a sense of the work 's purpose . At its best , the job of a reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivion , or lies , or a cover-up , or some other filthy travesty . In Latin America , I had admired the documentation centers , which sought to do the same , often in the face of persecution by governments and their goons . The centers did not attempt to cure the sickness of their society-that was beyond their ability-but simply to establish a written record of the lawlessness and brutality , the violation and exploitation that went on . Reporters did something similar . They wrote down what happened . But standing witness no longer seemed to be enough . Over time , the work had hollowed me . I was burned out , dry and crispy . <p> On Little Twig it was difficult to avoid a person , especially a wanderer like Inocencia . I saw her everywhere : on the beach where the fishermen worked , in the run-down corner stores , on the sandy paths that were the island 's highways , along the edge of the grass runway where a Cessna belonging to one of the Jacksons took off and landed every couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had a hard time keeping opponents . She cajoled , pressured , even bribed the kids in her neighborhood to play , but she took the game so seriously there was no fun in it for them . She played loudly , lost poorly , made extravagant threats . She cheated . One evening when the sky turned a domestic shade of red I tracked her down , took a seat across the checkerboard from her . The squeaky wicker chairs and oval table were set up in a corner of the front porch of the house where she rented a room . <p> " Want to play ? " I asked her . <p> She shook her head . She did n't want to play with me , a foreigner who spoke her language with a disconcerting accent . Besides , there must have been stories circulating about me , too . What was I doing on Little Twig ? I was not the standard druggie drifter they were accustomed to hosting . Inocencia picked at a tooth with nervous fingers and kicked off her plastic sandals . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in a forest only she could see . <p> " You work for the CIA , " she said . <p> " No , I do n't . I 'm a newspaper reporter . " <p> She nodded as if maybe she believed me , absent a reason not to . " A newspaper . " <p> " Let 's play checkers , " I tried again , but she waved me away , and I gave up . <p> Everybody on Little Twig had something to say about Inocencia . She was not a native . Three years earlier she had paid a fisherman to ferry her over from the mainland . In a plastic sack she hauled a change of clothes , a wind-up alarm clock , a small mirror , and a bead necklace she wore every other day . She rented a back room in a house on stilts , did odd jobs , smiled preemptively at people in the streets . She bought school notebooks and filled them up , writing in pencil . When the woman she rented her room from searched the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the heart of the story from Andy Jackson once he was convinced I was not a predator . As a girl , Inocencia lived in a small town in the hilly middle of Honduras . Her father worked as a notary public , as the editor of a small paper , as the news reader on a local radio station . Courtly in an obsolete manner , he wore a dark tie , greeted people in the streets with formal expressions of civility , held his hair in place with scented wax from round red tins imported from Mexico . He believed in education , and the perfectibility of society , and the power of words to ameliorate human behavior . <p> Don Fabricio did not intend to become a political radical . He lent his pleasant radio voice to a small-time farmer whose land was being appropriated by an army colonel on the lookout for a retirement nook with income-producing potential . The colonel coveted the farmer 's land . Fabricio employed the words that were his only weapon in a neighborly gesture to prevent an abuse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bully him into recanting . The farmer had already been evicted from his property ; there was no point continuing to espouse a lost cause . <p> But Fabricio did not back down . Inocencia was sixteen when they led her father away . Her mother closed the doors and windows of their house in an agreeable , flower-infested neighborhood , drew the curtains , and began to grieve . In the house , Inocencia felt deprived not just of light but of air as well . She could n't breathe . She spent her time in the road in front of the pink adobe building outside of town that served as a prison . There were no witnesses to Fabricio 's decision not to recant . The prison was situated far enough out of town that his screaming could not be heard unless a person were standing close by in the road . There was nothing in the terrible sounds the pain led him to make to suggest he knew his daughter was out there standing vigil . <p> The front door of the building opened . A shaved-headed grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which a bayonet was affixed . he looked at the girl in the dusty road . The summer evening was mellow . In a nearby swamp frogs bounced their voices off the lambent air . <p> " Give me my father , " Inocencia ordered the grunt . <p> " There 's nobody here , " he lied . " You 're supposed to go away , or you 'll get in trouble . " <p> Inocencia 's imagination entered its first adult phase . She imagined that all sound , all activity inside the adobe prison stopped . Brute hands were suspended midair ; mouths gaped . They were waiting to see what she would do . The howl with which she shattered the silence was like keening except that there was more resistance than resignation in it . She could have gone on bellowing all night if two soldiers had not shouldered their way past the grunt in the doorway and pinned her between them . They shook her until she subsided . <p> " Go home to your mother , " ordered the one who had locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like licorice and privilege . She nodded . They let her go . She turned around and walked toward town until she was sure the soldiers could no longer see her . Then she stopped . She turned back toward the prison , approaching it from a fenced field that ran behind the official property . The sun was going down . It was unnaturally still . The little bit of motion her body made coming through the grass stifled the crickets . <p> The night went completely dark before she heard her father groan again , pleading in his precise way for relief , as though careful grammar might convince them to let him go . Someone cursed , not in anger but in ignorant bafflement . Inocencia began howling again . <p> They tracked her down in the field . She might have run away , but the German shepherd they set loose terrified her , and fear froze her to the spot . They did n't know what to do with her . One of them came up with the idea of hauling her back to town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the backseat of the vehicle without struggling . When they dropped her off in the packed shadow of the church tower on the central plaza , she waited until they motored away before she followed the jeep back to the prison . <p> It went on for a week . What enraged the girl was not hearing the slightest recognition in her father 's pain-seared voice ; there was no sign he knew she was there . She howled , and the soldiers tracked her down . They deposited her in town , and she returned to the field of grass behind the prison in which her father 's ordeal lost any connection to the events that caused it to begin . Soon enough , he belonged to them . They did their job . <p> Versions varied on Little Twig as to how Inocencia left home . The story I believe had to do with the arrival of a major in army intelligence just back from anticommunist training in Fort Benning , Georgia . Brisk , decisive , he put an end to the torment the prisoner had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In town , reference to him was judged to be in bad taste . His widow languished behind dark drapes . <p> The major returned to the capital driving his own jeep . Someone observed Inocencia riding with him as the vehicle passed through town , her hands folded in her lap in an attitude of prim submission at odds with her windblown hair and the murderous look on her face . In Tegucigalpa , she was put to work as a domestic servant in the major 's household . The major 's wife , the daughter of a Cuban exile , was hard on the help , remembering how much better regulated things used to be in Havana . When the wife went to Miami to stay with her sister , the major introduced Inocencia to the notion of sex as a commercial transaction , as a commodity that could be taken or given , begged or bartered , demanded or withheld depending on market forces that anyone could learn to manipulate . <p> The major 's wife came home from Florida , remembering dancing on the beach to Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an umbrella in the sand , spread a blanket , poured cold beer into nice glasses . But she knew , because it was there in her house to know , so how could she fail to perceive it ? It had a smell . <p> The major was a problem solver , skilled at snipping unraveled ends . He found Inocencia a job in the kitchen at the officers ' club on the out-skirts of Tegucigalpa . Recognizing his obsession as a threat to everything he had achieved , he resolved not to eat at the club more often than was necessary from a professional point of view . But he could n't stay away . He made a fool of himself . <p> The situation became complicated . Suddenly there was another officer involved , and then a noncom . Maybe there were more . Maybe there were n't . Maybe nothing he suspected was true , but Inocencia disappeared from Tegucigalpa . A year later , she reappeared at an outpost base on the north coast , a mosquito-bit hole to which no one was transferred willingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certainly the major who brought her back to Teguz . There was a restaurant there that catered to the military brass . The owner owed the major a favor . Inocencia was given a place of privilege at La Gruta , where she was popular , remote , and somewhat puzzling to the uniformed clientele . <p> It required a leap of imagination to follow Inocencia from La Gruta to a clandestine political movement . She went underground , surfacing at a botched bank robbery in La Ceiba , drumming her fingers on the steering wheel of a stolen Volkswagen in front of the bank while her comrades bungled a simple heist . Someone was shot . Customers screamed . The teller raised a crucifix , aiming it at the would-be revolutionaries as though wood were the ultimate weapon . A flustered comrade stripped the cross from his hand , threw it on the floor and stomped . They left without any money , Inocencia driving the peach-colored VW to a stormy auto-critique session that lasted until the police arrived . <p> I did not believe that it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement Inocencia belonged to . Andy Jackson told me about the operation with the attitude of a man trying to convince both of us at the same time . But who ran the sting did n't matter . There was no trial . Inocencia disappeared again . Several years passed . No one was willing to speculate in my presence about what was done to her . What lay beyond dispute was the appearance on Little Twig of a woman in her twenties , disheveled and disoriented , too disturbing to be beautiful , who liked to play checkers . <p> Inocencia 's story spooked me . I tried to walk it off . The streets were hot sand . The houses of people with normal lives were shuttered against the noonday heat . Every last pig on the island had thrown itself against the shady side of a building . Bob Marley was talking about buffalo soldiers on someone 's radio . A nearsighted dog with liverish spots on its chest looked down the street , and there she was . Under a big ceiba tree shading the intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checkers in a drawstring sack of flowered fabric . <p> " They wo n't play with me , " she complained when I came up to her . <p> " They say you cheat . " I tried to make it sound as though I were just the messenger , and did n't have my own opinion about how she played the game . <p> She shook her head with militant assurance . " I do n't cheat . Let 's play . Now . " <p> Under her arm she carried a thin , napless blanket , which she spread on a flat space of shade under the tree . She set up the game . The board was homemade , a square of varnished plywood . The checkers were wooden slugs from which the red and black paint had begun to wear off . <p> I played poorly . I could n't see two moves ahead to develop a strategy . Inocencia did n't have to cheat to beat me . She was pleased to win on the merits of her play , which was super-aggressive . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me like a raptor . When she beat me , she gloated . <p> The myopic spotted dog came up close , slobbering over the checker-board . She shoved it roughly away . It limped out of range as though to exaggerate the harm she did it , and we played again . Her strong brown hand hovered over the board , dropped , and she jumped three of my checkers . She studied my face surreptitiously . <p> " It 's no good being a journalist , " she told me . <p> " I know . " <p> " Journalists are n't allowed to report what happened . Over there . " Her voice dropped a notch to convey trust . <p> " Is that where you went ? " <p> She nodded soberly , picked up one of my red checkers to which she was not entitled . I did n't contest the move . <p> " Did you want to go , or did they force you to go ? " <p> She shook her head . " Nobody chooses to go . You go because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was lucky . " <p> " Lucky how ? " <p> A man selling ice cream on a stick rang the reedy bell he had strapped to the square foam box in which he slugged his merchandise around the island . He walked with the diffident gait of a blind man in strange territory . No one showed up to buy from him . When he left , the dog trailed behind him to the next neighborhood . <p> " I 'm lucky , " Inocencia told me , " because I came back . Nobody comes back . " <p> " You win , " I admitted . " Another game ? " <p> " No . I have to go . " <p> " Then let 's play again tomorrow . " <p> " I ca n't play tomorrow . " <p> But she did . She could not resist the company of someone willing to play four or five or even ten games , especially someone it was not necessary to cheat to beat . We worked our way into a small ritual . At midday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we set up the checkerboard on the front porch of the house where she stayed . Inocencia brought out lemonade , sometimes with a chunk of ice in the pitcher , and I brought a package of sweet crackers . Sometimes she plugged in a radio , but she could only tolerate certain kinds of music . She liked classical best . Rock and roll made her edgy . Mexican rancheras and boleros made her edgier . Speaking voices were worse . She could not endure two minutes of news ; the melodramatic babble of the announcer rattled her . <p> It took me a long time to figure out what she meant when she talked about the other side . When I finally caught on , I wobbled with a kind of shame . Not for me , and not for Inocencia herself . It was a shame that came simply from knowing about her hell . <p> There were moisture rings from the lemonade pitcher and our glasses on the surface of the little table on the porch . There was the belligerent sound of someone snoring behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife blade on a wooden cutting board somewhere else . There were the complementary smells of fish and cooking oil . There was Inocencia 's habit of sitting with her feet slightly contorted , the toes lifted and twisted , as though she were ready to bolt from her chair any second . A rooster , startled out of its foraging by the silence , stopped pecking in the limp , yellowed grass . Its dusty red feathers gleamed . <p> " Over there " was the place they took Inocencia after she and her comrades were picked up in a counterinsurgency operation called Operation Stability . She left her body behind , a physical fact she found curious because when she landed on the other side she still had it , fully functioning and vulnerable . She knew it was more than a fantasy because of the number and variety of things they did to her body , the assaults on specific parts of it : legs and arms , breasts and thighs , head and back and the soles of her feet . <p> It was the largest room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see the walls . If there was a door , she never saw it . She tried to believe in a door , a way out of the room . And she chose to call them agents rather than devils . It was helpful to think of them as agents because it meant whatever they did to her they were acting on orders . The orders came from elsewhere . Knowing that , reasoning it through in the unpredictable intervals when they left her alone , she permitted herself an occasional sensation of relief . Relief , justified or not , restored the body they battered . <p> " Hell , " I prompted her once . " That 's where you were . " <p> She shook her head severely . She had already considered and discarded the possibility . " This was different . " <p> It was different because of the connection with what she remembered of the life from which the military had evicted her . <p> There had to be other victims being held as she was held , either in the same place or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom saw or even sensed any of them . The few times she did , she was not certain afterward that what she had seen was really a person , someone with a bruisable body like hers . She was left with the doubt that maybe the agents had manipulated her environment , creating the illusion of fellow sufferers close by , assuming the sight of them might help break her . What did n't seem to occur to the agents was that a person who was already dead had no cause to experience despair . <p> It was not like being in a prison , where you felt the constant presence of other prisoners even when you were alone in your cell . The normal spatial relationships , the boundary markers and lines and bumpers that separated a person from other people and the space they took up , were not relevant . It was as though . . . She hunted for a way to explain . <p> It was not that I was dense , only that I had not been there , so how could I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an underworld beyond imagining , the jurisdiction of the agents and the bosses who gave the agents their orders . <p> She folded her hands , unfolded them . <p> For the longest time she assumed that the agents had no faces . If they had a face it was collective , a mask they put on and took off at will . Faceless , they were unable to register emotions , which was not to say that they were inhuman . She was clear about that . And she would not call it confinement because the lassitude that enveloped her like a syrup was her own . It belonged to her more than , say , her memories did . <p> None of what Inocencia told me came out connectedly . We played a lot of checkers , drank a lot of lemonade . She talked less than she played , but I did a lot of listening . So there was no excuse for making the stupid mistake I did , asking her if she knew how long she had been there . She looked at me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She swept the checkers off the board onto the porch floor , left me sitting there . It took a couple days to get her to play again , but when she did she seemed to have almost forgotten my lapse . <p> " It ca n't be reported , " she reminded me , and I nodded submissively . <p> I was n't sure whether Inocencia craved my company more than I craved hers , but eventually we got past the checkers . She liked walking better than she liked playing , and I liked following her around Little Twig and watching her write in her notebooks . I understood that the purpose of the notebooks was to recover what was taken from her . She was writing it down , everything that happened to her while she was gone . She was making a negative inventory , a list of the things she did n't have . <p> The evening she asked me to go back with her to her room I knew the invitation had nothing to do with sex . We had gone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . The herons were there , apparitions with long legs and a sense of belonging that was splendid , enviable , not to be imitated . We stared at the placid birds until there was not enough light to make them out against the water , then walked slowly back to town . <p> No one noticed that I went into Inocencia 's room with her . She was snappish and wary . She told me she was tired . She spread a sheet on the floor next to her bed and invited me to lie there when she lay down on the bed . I lay on my back on the neatly folded sheet and stared at the ceiling while she wrote something in her notebook . Every letter was an expressive scratch , every word a victory . I did n't want to read what she wrote , but I wondered whether the words added up to sentences . I wondered about her verbs . She propped a flash so that a spray of white light fell on the page . When she finished , she switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She rested her head in her hand . Writing had drained the stress from her . The sensation of release was palpable . <p> " What do you do when it fills up ? " I asked her . <p> " There 's a place I go . On the north shore . " <p> " A place . " <p> " When the notebook is full , I burn it . " <p> " Which helps more , writing or burning ? " <p> She looked at me as if recognizing a trick question . " You have to keep trying to get your life back . " <p> " Is that enough ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> " Lie next to me for a while . " <p> I lay next to her on the narrow bed . She faced away from me , a decision to trust I did not underestimate . I let one arm rest on her turned shoulder . Her body was permanently rigid , desexed , like plywood . Proximity did n't touch her . She was crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her plywood shoulder . After a few minutes , she began to snore lightly although her body did not untense . <p> I fell asleep worrying about tarantulas . I had seen one squashed by a broom the day before . So I thought it was a poison spider on my shoulder that woke me in the dead middle of the night , but it was only Inocencia 's hand . She got out of bed , lit a candle , and paced the floor . <p> " Las garzas , " she announced . " The herons . I just heard them fly over . Did you hear them ? " <p> " I was asleep . " <p> " They do n't come this way very often . When they do . . . " she trailed off . <p> " When they do ? " <p> " They 're mercy birds , that 's all . When they fly over the house , they lift me up . They make me feel as though I 'm flying with them , as though I do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I go with them . " <p> I had never seen anything like the intense , quiet ecstasy that seemed to invade her . If she had been religious , it would have been a state of grace descending . As it was , I found myself next to a miracle of difficult description . Her euphoria awed me . <p> " Sit up , " she ordered . <p> I sat up . <p> " Tell me what you 're thinking . " <p> " I 'm thinking about a Turkish boy I saw outside of Berlin . Lying in the snow with his shirt ripped open , in front of his apartment building . A bunch of German punks carved a swastika into his chest . I 'm thinking about the Turkish boy 's chest . " <p> I did not expect to start sobbing . Crying was proscribed by the insanity correspondent 's handbook . But once I started , I could n't stop . I hunkered over my knees , and convulsions ran through my body in waves . In a moment , Inocencia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bent shoulder not so much to comfort as to express solidarity . She made sisterly noises of sympathy , better than words . <p> " It 's not enough , " I said . <p> " What 's not enough ? " <p> " Being a witness . " <p> " One thing I 've noticed , " she told me with bright false confidence . " They 'll be back . When the herons fly over my house they always come back . " <p> I sat up straight . I wanted to believe her . I wanted to be ready for them . The candle flickered , piqued by a breeze we could n't feel , and Inocencia tightened her hold on me . <p> " They 're coming , " she informed me after a while . She stood up in anticipation . <p> " Get up , " she said . <p> I got up . I waited with her . For my own separate reasons I wanted what Inocencia wanted , I wanted it as badly as she did , but I knew the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before she told me to follow her outside . <p> The night noises of Little Twig-insects caroling in the black trees , a generator starting and stopping , a baby crying through a nightmare-seemed louder than normal . The sand on the path was cool on our feet . An oversized moon low in the sky varnished the trees and bushes and the front faces of houses and shops like mementos , objects worthy of being preserved by someone with a huge memory , a god who tallied the specifics of creation . I knew before we left her street that Inocencia was heading for the herons ' cove . <p> There were no herons there , no birds of any description , but a fish jumped on the placid surface of the water , which was thatched with moonlight , and a dun-colored horse with a dark mane browsed the plant life on the opposite end of the cove where the woods came close to the shore . It lifted its head and snorted once when it heard us , then went back to cropping green . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I knew there was no chance of stopping her . <p> She stripped to her underwear and struck out in the glassy water powered by a steady overhand stroke . She did not expect me to follow her , or to stop her . She only wanted the thin protection a witness provided . I was tired of being a witness . I shucked my jeans and went in after her . <p> I 'm not much of a swimmer , and the water was painfully cold , but after a ragged sprint I caught up with her and paddled alongside trying to conserve some strength . <p> " Where are you going ? " <p> " Go back , " she told me . <p> " Not until you tell me where you 're going . " <p> She lifted one gangly arm out of the water and pointed toward the moon , which was lowering over the horizon so that it looked , for the moment , like an island of light , a place a strong person could swim to and maybe even live on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " she told me again . Her voice was compassionate , full of understanding , but she was distracted , focused on her luminous goal . <p> I could n't go back . By then , the closest point of land was a high , scrub-treed sandbar to our right , the edge of the cove where it opened on to the sea . There was no use talking . I did n't have the strength to waste . There would be only one chance to grab her . It had to happen as we came even with the bar . Maybe she would n't expect it . I thought maybe I had enough power left to wrap her up with my arms , then haul her onto the sand . I knew she would not forgive me . <p> " Look , " she warned me , stopping to catch her breath . She was hoarse , placid , already wearing out . " It 's going . " <p> We treaded water for a moment , eyes fixed on the moon island as it flattened on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ran in our direction . The island sank perceptibly as we watched . <p> " We have to go fast , " said Inocencia , swimming again , and we went fast . <p>
