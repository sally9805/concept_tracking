Ingrid Levin-Hill sat in math class , her mind wandering pleasantly . She had the best seat in the house  --  very back of the outside row by the windows , about as far as could be from the teacher , Ms. Groome . Ferrand Middle School stood on a hill overlooking the river , about a mile upstream from the falls . There was always something interesting to see on the river , especially if you were in the habit of noticing little details . Little details like how the water ruffled up as it flowed around a rock , and a big black bird drifting on the current , wings tucked under its chin , and  --  " Ingrid ? I trust I have your attention ? " Ingrid whipped around . Ms. Groome was watching her through narrowed eyes , and her eyes were narrow to begin with . " One hundred percent , " said Ingrid , in the faint hope of pacifying Ms. Groome with math talk . " Then I 'm sure you 're excited about MathFest . " MathFest ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even make sense , one of those contradictions in terms . " Very excited , " said Ingrid . " Just in case Ingrid happened to miss any of this , " said Ms. Groome , " who wants to sum up MathFest ? " No one did . " Bruce ? " said Ms. Groome . Brucie Berman , middle row , front seat , class clown . His leg was doing that twitchy thing . " MathFest be my guest , " said Brucie . " I beg your pardon ? " Brucie tried to look innocent , but he 'd been born with a guilty face . " Three lucky kids from this class get to go to MathFest , " he said . " And MathFest is ? " " This big fat fun math blowout they 're having tomorrow , " said Brucie . " Not tomorrow , " said Ms. Groome . " Saturday morning , eight thirty , at the high school . " " Even better , " said Brucie . Ms. Groome pursed her lips , totally focused now on Brucie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . Ingrid tuned out , just in time to catch that big black bird disappear around a bend in the river . No way this had anything to do with her , no way she 'd be one of the chosen three . She should n't even have been in this section , Algebra Two . There were four math classes in eighth grade  --  Algebra One for the geniuses , Algebra Two for good math students who did n't rise to the genius level , Pre-Algebra , where Ingrid should have been and would have been happily , if her parents had n't crawled on their knees to Ms. Groome , and Math One , formerly remedial math , for the kids out on parole . Math blowouts on Saturday morning . Who thinks these things up ? Grown-ups , of course , the kind with a sense of humor like that warden in Escape from Alcatraz . Ingrid was half aware of Ms. Groome scrawling long chains of numbers on the blackboard , all dim and fuzzy . She wrote a note  --  What 's the word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and tossed it discreetly over to Mia 's desk across the aisle . Mia was the smartest kid in the class , should have been in Algebra One , but she and her mom had moved from New York last year and the school had messed up . Mia flattened out the note , read it , wrote an answer . The sun , one of those little fall suns , more silver than gold , shone on Mia 's hand  --  her fingers , skin , everything about her , so delicate . She rolled the note back up , flicked it underhanded across the aisle . Ingrid reached for it , but all at once , so sudden she was n't sure for a moment that it had really happened , another hand darted into the picture and snatched the note out of the air . Nothing delicate about this hand , skin scaly , knuckles all swollen . " What could be so important ? " said Ms. Groome , unfolding the note . " I 'm dying to find out . " The sun glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She read the note , stuck it in her pocket , returned to the front of the class . Her mouth opened , just a thin sharklike slit . Some withering remark was on the way , but at that very moment , like a message from above , the bell rang . Class over ! Saved by the bell ! Chairs started scraping all over the room as the kids got up . Hubbub , and lots of it . Thanksgiving could n't come soon enough . " Just a second , " said Ms. Groome , not so much raising her voice over the bedlam as cutting through it like an ice pick . Everyone froze . " We still have n't chosen our MathFest team . " Brucie raised his hand . " Thank you , Bruce . Congratulations . " " Oh , no , " said Brucie . " Wait . I was just going to say let 's do it tomorrow . " Ms. Groome did n't seem to hear . " Any volunteers for the other two spots ? " There were none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Groome . She smiled , if smiling meant the corners of the mouth twisting up and teeth making a brief appearance . " Mia . Ingrid . Everybody wish our team good luck . " " Go team , " said everybody , in a great mood because it was n't them . " But wait , " said Brucie . " I could get sick , " Brucie said on the bus ride home . Someone snickered . " What if I forged a note ? " Brucie said . " With Adobe Photoshop I could make it look like a doctor 's  --  " " Zip it , guy , " said the driver , Mr. Sidney , his Battle of the Coral Sea cap slanted low over his eyes , like a ship captain in rough seas . Brucie zipped it ; the other choice was walking the rest of the way , as Brucie had learned on the first day of school last year and then had to relearn again just last week . Mr. Sidney stopped in front of Ingrid 's house . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petunia to Mr. Sidney , guys guy . Things must have been a lot different when he was growing up . Ingrid stepped off the bus , started up the brick path to her house . Ninety-nine Maple Lane was the only place she 'd ever lived . Not the biggest , newest , or fanciest house in the neighborhood , Riverbend , but there were lots of good things about it . . . .
