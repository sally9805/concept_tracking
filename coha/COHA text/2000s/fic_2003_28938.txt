Ilium Chapter One The Plains of Ilium Rage . Sing , O Muse , of the rage of Achilles , of Peleus ' son , murderous , man-killer , fated to die , sing of the rage that cost the Achaeans so many good men and sent so many vital , hearty souls down to the dreary House of Death . And while you 're at it , O Muse , sing of the rage of the gods themselves , so petulant and so powerful here on their new Olympos , and of the rage of the post-humans , dead and gone though they might be , and of the rage of those few true humans left , self-absorbed and useless though they may have become . While you are singing , O Muse , sing also of the rage of those thoughtful , sentient , serious but not-so-close-to-human beings out there dreaming under the ice of Europa , dying in the sulfur-ash of Io , and being born in the cold folds of Ganymede . Oh , and sing of me , O Muse , poor **27;420;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his friends , to friends long since turned to dust on a world long since left behind . Sing of my rage , yes , of my rage , O Muse , small and insignificant though that rage may be when measured against the anger of the immortal gods , or when compared to the wrath of the god-killer , Achilles . On second thought , O Muse , sing of nothing to me . I know you . I have been bound and servant to you , O Muse , you incomparable bitch . And I do not trust you , O Muse . Not one little bit . If I am to be the unwilling Chorus of this tale , then I can start the story anywhere I choose . I choose to start it here . It is a day like every other day in the more than nine years since my rebirth . I awaken at the Scholia barracks , that place of red sand and blue sky and great stone faces , am summoned by the Muse , get sniffed and passed by the murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grassy summits of Olympos via the high-speed east-slope crystal escalator and  --  once reported in at the Muse 's empty villa  --  receive my briefing from the scholic going off-shift , don my morphing gear and impact armor , slide the taser baton into my belt , and then QT to the evening plains of Ilium . If you 've ever imagined the siege of Ilium , as I did professionally for more than twenty years , I have to tell you that your imagination almost certainly was not up to the task . Mine was n't . The reality is far more wonderful and terrible than even the blind poet would have us see . First of all there there is the city , Ilium , Troy , one of the great armed poleis of the ancient world  --  more than two miles away from the beach where I stand now but still visible and beautiful and domineering on its high ground , its tall walls lighted by thousands of torches and bonfires , its towers not quite as topless as Marlowe would have us believe , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there are the Achaeans and Danaans and other invaders  --  technically not yet " Greeks " since that nation will not come into being for more than two thousand years , but I will call them Greeks anyway  --  stretched mile after mile here along the shoreline . When I taught the Iliad , I told my students that the Trojan War , for all its Homeric glory , had probably been a small affair in reality  --  some few thousands of Greek warriors against a few thousand Trojans . Even the best informed members of the scholia  --  that group of Iliad scholars going back almost two millennia  --  estimated from the poem that there could not possibly be more than 50,000 Achaeans and other Greek warriors drawn up in their black ships along the shore . They were wrong . Estimates now show that there are more than 250,000 attacking Greeks and about half that number of defending Trojans and their allies . Evidently every warrior hero in the Greek Isles came running to this battle  --  for battle meant plunder  --  and brought his soldiers and allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual impact is stunning : mile upon mile of lighted tents , campfires , sharpened-stake defenses , miles of trenches dug in the hard ground above the beaches  --  not for hiding and hunkering in , but as a deterrent to Trojan cavalry  --  and , illuminating all those miles of tents and men and shining on polished spears and bright shields , thousands of bonfires and cooking fires and corpse fires burning bright . Corpse fires . For the past few weeks , pestilence has been creeping through the Greek ranks , first killing donkeys and dogs , then dropping a soldier here , a servant there , until suddenly in the past ten days it has become an epidemic , slaying more Achaean and Danaan heroes than the defenders of Ilium have in months . I suspect it is typhus . The Greeks are sure it is the anger of Apollo . I 've seen Apollo from a distance  --  both on Olympos and here  --  and he 's a very nasty fellow . Apollo is the archer god , lord of the silver bow , " he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god of healing , he 's also the god of disease . More than that , he 's the principle divine ally of the Trojans in this battle , and if Apollo were to have his way , the Achaeans would be wiped out . Whether this typhoid came from the corpse-fouled rivers and other polluted water here or from Apollo 's silver bow , the Greeks are right to think that he wishes them ill . At this moment the Achaean " lords and kings "  --  and every one of these Greek heroes is a sort of king or lord in his own province and in his own eyes  --  are gathering in a public assembly ...
