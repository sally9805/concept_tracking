The Capture " This place gives me the creeps , big time , " Krause muttered , shifting her M16 rifle from one shoulder to the other . " Maybe it 's the land mines , " her patrol buddy Linville remarked . His voice was matter-of-fact . " We could call you Stumpy . " " Bite me , " Krause said . The sweepers had done a good job clearing the ground when the Allies rode in . She looked down at her feet nervously , unable to see them in the dark . You never knew . It was raining in Kosovo . The landscape of this tormented place was the rugged rolling stuff of the northern Mediterranean , a green and fertile land with a wild beauty . The terrain looked like home to one of the two soldiers slogging through the mudStaff Sergeant David Linville of Mendocino , California . His buddy , S Jan Krause , was from Kansas , and the craggy hills cut with narrow valleys made the wary farm girl nervous : She kept seeing snipers ' nests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sighted suspicious activity in the area and reported it to their superiors . Activity was the wrong word ; it was more like a glow , too big for a house fire , too small to be a forest fire . It was centered in a small bombed-out village listed on the maps as Sv . Arhangeli . The film in the plane 's cameras had been fogged , and that was incentive enough to send in a foot patrol . Krause and Linville walked in silence for a time . Between them they carried cameras and radiationdetectors ; Krause was outfitted with a device to detect the common chemicals used in assembling bombs . The odds were against any incident turning into something major . All that either one of them wanted to do was get to Arhangeli , do their job , and get back safe again to barracks . " Hey , " said Krause without a preamble , " you know the Virgin Mary 's from around here ? " Linville did n't slow down . The darkness around him was soft and pleasant . Deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No lie . Tompkins was telling me the other night . She 's been showing up to a bunch of kids . " " Lucky them , " Linville said absentmindedly . " Why do n't we wait here for a while ? " The road had crested a small rise , and the village had to be below them , with no more than a few scattered farm lights around it . The remaining cluster of houses had been bombed , burned , shelled , and dynamited until nothing was left except a lumpy plain of vaguely geometric rubble . The church , they knew , was in the distance , a gray stone building that had once been white , and nearly invisible in the hazy night . Krause grunted noncommitally , dropping her heavy pack to the ground and sitting on it . She dug a small pair of field glasses out of her pack and began to inspect the terrain , which was clearing now as the moon broke through melting clouds . She finally got a good look at their objective . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nod and reached for his pack . They had just gotten to their feet when they heard the sound . It was a low rumble , a deep remote foghorn sound that Seemed to echo off the sides of the surrounding hills , as if some buried music was crying out from beneath the ground . " Weird noise , man . Some kinda truck horn ? " Krause said after a long frozen moment . " Sure it is , " Linville agreed ironically . " You ever heard a truck that sounded hungry ? Or perhaps it does n't mind scaring off its prey . " " Is that supposed to spook me ? The sound 's definitely coming from that direction . " Krause pointed at the church . " What makes you so sure ? It sounded a lot farther away , " Linville said cautiously . " Maybe . " Krause was poised , listening to the unearthly echoes . " Let 's go find out . That 's why we get the big bucks , right ? " The last echoing notes died wheezily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took nearly half an hour to reach the Churchyard walls . Just as they approached the gaping doorway of the sanctuary , the wailing began again , higher and more hypnotic . " Take cover , " Linville ordered tightly , The two flattened ' themselves against the plastered walls , looking at each other . " Go on , sarge , " Krause whispered . " I 'll cover your flank . " " You go on , " Linville shot back . He wondered if Krause was making fun of him for acting like they were under attack . " I just remembered something , " Krause said , her voice normal now . There was an odd look on her face . " What ? " " Organs . This is an old church , it 's got ta have a honker organ . Maybe a cat got into it . " Linville shook his head . " Do n't they run on electricity ? Where are they getting electricity around here ? " Krause looked toward the blasted village . " Good question . " The hooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncanniness of the situation reassured Krause . " C'm on , let 's go . " Linville followed his buddy inside . There was no pipe organ that either could see inside the ruined church . Rain dripped from the shattered timbers of the broken roof . The sanctuary Smelled of wet and decay . Hesitantly , Linville started toward the pulpit as Krause turned to cover him . Their combat instincts told them that something ominous was going on , despite the hush . " There 's nothing left in here , " Linville said , relaxing slightly . " Anything that could burn is ashes already . " He pointed to signs that small fires had been built here , as soldiers or refugees took what shelter they could find . The murals of robed saints had been defaced with graffiti scrawled in dried blood . Linville flicked on his flashlight . Over the altar he could read the word HATO , which was Cyrillic for NATO . But you could read it either way . Krause was sweeping the walls with her chemical detector , hoping for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his StarTac and punched in his commander 's number . " C'm on , Loot . Answer the friggin ' phone so we can all go home . " Krause turned and shrugged , palms up . There was nothing here to find , no trace of radiation or chemical precursors to explosives . She began repacking her equipment . " Churchill . " " Lieutenant , this is Linville . We gained the objective at around 23:00 hours , but so far we got " Just then the sound came roaring over them again , a vast , organlike thrumming that filled the violated space like an ocean wave . In the same instant that the two American soldiers registered this fact , the air was suffused with light , a light that grew and swelled . " What 's going on , sergeant ? You ' re breaking up , " the lieutenant 's voice squeaked faintly in Linville 's earpiece . Linville tried yelling into his instrument , but the roaring noise made him cover his ears with his fists . Now the light grew until it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linville could make out Krause screaming in protest , a wordless outcry that might have been awe , fear , or simply recognition that they were woefully unequipped to face whatever force was toppling over their heads . Krause turned to run . Linville , closer to the source than she was , could not do even that much . This is n't what I expected , he thought lamely in the brief interval before he began to black out , Sharpness like a knife blade pierced his retina , and he was alone in a white blindness as terrible as a black one . Not what I expected at all . " Can they see us ? " the general asked , looking through the grayish square of glass into the hospital room . " No , sir , " his aide answered . " From their side it 's a mirror . And I think they have some residual blindness . The doctors are keeping the room dim . " " I see , " The general peered at the bandaged faces of the two menmake that two soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had both worn thick eye bandages ; now the swathed white faces wore a layer of thin gauze . They looked spookily lire pale racoons in the faint light that filtered in through the blinds . " Can they talk ? " the general asked . " Limited communication has been possible , but they came out with some strange ideas . " His aide coughed apologetically , as if to show that this hitch was n't his fault . " When the hell can they be debriefed ? " " No one knows , sir . The thing of it is " " They do n't make any damn sense when they do talk . That 's the thing of it , right ? " " I suppose so , sir . " Tom Stillano had been put in command of Task Force Gabriel exactly a week beforerotten luck . The viewing room off the isolation ward left just enough space for a side chair and table ; a digital sound recorder stood by blinking red and yellow signals that meant nothing to the general . He had every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So what does this all meanwe should sell ringside seats to the end of the world ? " he barked when they hit his desk . If there was any sanity accidentally floating around the Army field command , the fat manila folder would never have gotten that far , would have dissolved in the murk of " channels . " What next ? Maybe the DOD was testing dinosaurs for cavalry games . Walter Reed Army Medical Center is the military 's largest health-care delivery system . The main installation , a swarm of mostly low bunkerlike buildings , occupies 113 acres in northwest Washington . As with any entity so close to the corridors of power , secrets as well as truths lie hidden here . Ten days ago , two GIs had been picked up by their unit in eastern Kosovo . They were raving and blinded , suitably terrified after stumbling in the woods for at least twenty-four hours . They had made pitiful attempts to avoid enemy scrutiny , digging holes in the forest floor with their hands and covering their bodies with leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding officer at the moment the incident had occurred , both of them would be dead by now , and the United States might have no idea of the magnitude of the threat it faced . Krause and Linville had been found near a tiny village the maps called Sv . Arhangeli . What had been found there with them had been the reason that Stillano was plucked from his small outer-ring Pentagon office to Walter Reed 's central core . Aerial photographs were the first to confirm that the entire rear wall of the Orthodox church had vanishednot burned out or bombed but simply vaporized , leaving no debris behind , not even ashes . Through the open roof , already destroyed by the local strife , the camera caught an amorphous image that at first appeared to be only a bright light . Brilliant as a ground flare by night , it retained enough luminosity by day to show up easily on the eight-by-tens that lay scattered across General Stillano 's desk . No one had seen a light from such a source ; it was not feeding off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the scarce farm population have anything to do with the phenomenon , other than to stand around and gawk . The locals began to gather the morning after NATO lost track of its patrol unit . At first it was a matter of three or four old peasant women , who had probably never abandoned the church despite its devastation ; they summoned the nearest priest , and then small crowds of farmers and children began to swell . By the time NATO armored vehicles made it into the area , pilgrims were standing constant vigil on the perimeter of the sanctuary . Their candles looked like fireflies at night , flickering glimmers against the total blackout of the town . The peasants assumed that the light came from God . The local NATO commander , a Bavarian tank officer named Hopf , decided to take nuclear spill precautions , as if a second Chernobyl were . blowing its core reactor . He cleared the area for two miles around , imposed a curfew , travel ban , and media blackout . These moves were resented by the locals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside worldexcept perhaps for Russian spy satelliteslearned nothing about the phenomenon . The brilliant light had no definite shape . It was approximately three meters across , according to Hopf 's communiqus , and hovered over the ruined altar about four meters in the air . With protective shielding and welder 's goggles , it was possible to approach very close to it . Technicians detected no measurable increase in gamma or X rays nearby , ruling out the assumption that this was a nuclear incident . " It 's a damn quark or something , " the Army major on the ground reported to Colonel Burke . " Only it 's not hot , sir . I mean , the ground and air temperature do n't vary within a hundred yards . " " So you 're telling me it just hangs there and glows like a Christmas tree ? " Burke demanded . Stillano 's aide was not an imaginative man , and after the first whistle of amazement , this whatever-it-was became a nuisanceyou Could pull the troops out and give it back to the peasants as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not exactly a Christmas tree , sir , " the major on the ground muttered doubtfully . " You 'd have to see it for yourself . " By the time it was determined that Krause and Linville were in a state of religious hysteria , Stillano Had come on board , and quickly the decisions were kicked upstairs . " If Christ returned to quarterback for the Redskins , " the general grumbled , " they 'd find a way to make it a national security priority . " The whole mess was a logistical nightmare . Funding had to go through to tuous routes that made it seem like the ultimate black ops fiasco ; NATO had to be shrugged off ( an easier task than you might suppose , because their heavy responsibilities in Kosovo did n't leave much room for the paranormal ) , and eventually the President was sure to want hourly briefings . " I wish those two grunts nothing but good , " Stillano remarked in private , " but it would have made the situation a whole lot simpler if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillano now thought , glaring at his watch . At that moment the door down the hall opened , and a tall man in civilian clothes walked through carrying a black valise . He wore wire-rimmed glasses , his hair was cropped short enough to expose his skull . The tall man held out his hand , shifting the valise as he did . " I got here a couple of minutes agoMarty Carter . " He was in his early thirties , a good twenty years younger than Stillano . " I think they might be too tired for us right now , " said Stillano , disguising his resentment that a civilian contingent had been called in . Carter smiled without mirth . " Let 's check on them and see . It never hurts to try , right ? " He walked ahead of the general and entered past the Marine guards without asking Stillano for a by-your-leave . " Hello , gentlemen , " Carter said cheerfully as he entered . " You awake in there ? " " Yes , sir , " Krause croaked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauze over her eyes was thin enough so that she turned her head in Carter 's direction . " Sorry thereI should have said gentleman and lady , " Carter corrected himself . He stood between the two beds ; both soldiers looked warily toward him . He hoisted the valise onto Linville 's bed and began rifling for some papers . Linville was half sitting now . " I can give you ten minutes , " the general said from behind him . Carter did n't look around or give any sign that he had heard . " Good , so here we are , " he began , opening a thin folder pulled from his valise . He picked up a chair resting next to the wall and sat down , not bothering to take notes . He realized , Stillano told himself , that every sound made in this room was being recorded on the other side of the mirror . " My name is Marty . I 'm from the government , and I 'm here to help you . " He smiled faintly at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we really need to know what happened out there . " " We 've already told the commander " Linville began to say . " Roger that , " Carter interrupted . " Whatever you 've said up to now , a lot of people are going to want to hear it again . I 'm just the first . " He shut the folder , not needing to consult it . " They say we 're ... stateside , " Krause mumbled , her voice soft and-hopeful . " Are they going to send us home ? " " They 're sure not going to send you back to Kosovo , " Carter replied firmly , telling the truth where he could . " As for going home , we 'd better get you patched up first . I think I 've answered enough of your questions . Tell me what you saw at Arhangeli . " " We were on recon , checking out a lead passed to us by the War Pigs , " Linville said slowly , using the nickname for the Seventh Cavalry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We got to this old church . There was an organ playing . " " It was n't no organ , sir , " Krause corrected . " It was ... I do n't know what it was . " " Did you go inside the church ? " Carter asked , his voice even and low . " Yeah , " Krause said , " we went inside . The whole place was a mess , but it was clean . No tangos . " Tango was military slang for terrorists , Carter knew . As if anyone could tell exactly who the terrorists were in this particular war . " So what did you do , then ? Linville ? You called Lieutenant Churchill , did n't you ? " " I ca n't really remember ... it got so bright , and there was a blast , " the sergeant replied . " You were thrown clear , though ? Because neither of you shows any kind of injury from explosive impact . " Linville had nothing to reply . Carter chose not to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a recent explosion , either . He said , " And the brightness , where was it coming from ? " " Everywhere , sir . " " You ca n't be more specific ? " Krause spoke up . " It came from heaven . " Carter turned to her . " From the sky ? Like a bomb or a meteor ? " She shook her head . " No , from heaven . " " I see . " Carter nodded . He kept a benign expression on his narrow face , even though he was ready to sell both of them upriver . He was the original Teflon boy , Stillano noted . Nothing would stick to that shiny manicured surface . No blame , certainly no guilt . " You agree with that , Sergeant ? " he asked Linville . " I do n't know .... Like I said , it seemed to be everywhere . " Stillano 's mind began to drift . It was clear that nobody was going to learn anything new , no matter how many times Carter took them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground in Kosovo had been unprecedented . After two days of quarantine , the hovering light had not moved or disappeared . The U.S. observers were caught in a time crunch , since the secret could n't be kept indefinitely . Also , some peculiar things were happening psychologically , it seemed . The technicians who got too close to the light behaved erratically afterward ; Several refused to enter the church again . Some flavor of the religious mania that Linville and Krause had exhibited was affecting them . Although she tried to hide it , Krause still mumbled to herself constantly . At first some sort of post-trauma psychosis was suspected , until it was discovered that she was praying . When asked why , she declined to answer . If Linville was also praying , he disguised it better ; the evaluation from the psych officer contended that he might be returned to active duty in time . The Army drew a cordon around the light and cut off further tests . " Pursuant to getting this thing in a cage or shooting it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are n't touching it . " Now what ? NASA had developed prototype " catcher 's mitts " to be used on the space shuttle , long-handled mesh enclosures to retrieve satellites that had floated out of orbit . Some blue-sky thinking had envisioned the possibility of using these to capture bits of comets or meteors one day . " We 're not talking about snagging kryptonite in the outfield , for Christ 's sake , " Stillano had said witheringly when the idea was proposed to use such a mechanism to cage the hovering light . " I need to know what 's inside . There has to be a thing in that church , get it ? Light does n't appear from nowhere . " " It 's like a laser , sir , " Burke had explained after scrutinizing the scientific reports . " Only it 's not focused into a beam . I do n't get it entirely , but one thing 's for sureit 's not sunlight or any kind of light from a star that has been seen from earth . " That settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as alien , debatably a life-form , but possibly a tear in the fabric of the universe that had shot an enormous dose of unknown energy into our little wrinkle of space-time . Although this conclusion added little to anyone 's knowledge , it settled the question about blowing it out of the sky or caging it : The cage won . Half the observers began to call the thing Kong , but those who were less whimsical called it the capture . It felt decidedly alive , some claimed , if not our conception of any life-form met on earth . A stubborn minority , pure techno-geeks by disposition , argued that giving it a personality was ludicrous ; they held on to the possibility that the thing was a wandering white hole emanating force from beyond the known cosmos . " We 're gon na bag it , sir , " the ground commander reported on the third day of observation , " but we might have to take the whole damn church with it . " Between the Seabees and the physicists who were dropped in , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture was there voluntarily , and although powerful and unpredictable , it was n't hostile . One could assume with some certainty that therefore it would n't resist being moved . You could n't lead it out on a leash , but if the capture was cooperative , you could envelop it lightly in such a way that it would be disguised from view . No restraints would be necessary ( not that anyone had the foggiest notion what kind of straitjacket would conceivably hold it ) . In the end , it came down to floating their prize out in a blimp . An Army weather blimp was dismantled and reassembled inside the walls of the church , piece by piece . As the last sections were refitted and the seams sealed , there was the delicate question of filling it with helium , but the capture did n't act disturbed . Its luminosity appeared to decrease whenever the operation brought anyone too close , as if it knew what was going on . Enclosed inside its silver sheath , the capture was hauled through the opening that had once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tethers behind slow-moving Apache helicopters by night . The nearest airport at Pristina had been repaired sufficiently to allow a mammoth C-5a Galaxy transport to land , a plane big enough to carry a small army and all its equipment . The blimp was slipped into the huge interior , and forty-eight hours after the military had cordoned off the scene , the capture was on its way out of Europe . All these details were contained in the folder on Stillano 's desk , and he had to assume that Carter was just as privy to them . Then why the hell was he badgering these two white mummies in the hospital ? The general found himself getting hotter at the CIA 's game-playing . " That 's it , " he said loudly . " Time 's up . " Carter looked around in annoyance , but he saw ( Continues ... )
