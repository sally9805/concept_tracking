Finally , footwear gets smart . The new Adidas 1 is the first running shoe to adjust its cushioning levels automatically during a jog . With every step , a magnetic sensor in the heel measures the force exerted by a runner and transmits this data to a microprocessor under the arch . The chip drives a tiny cable system that adjusts the heel , which gets harder to cushion the blow when your tired feet are pounding the pavement and then softer to relax them while walking across the lawn . The shoe might also relax your wallet : the Adidas 1 will retail at $250 when it hits stores this winter .  --  By Sean Gregory
