Chapter One " How long will the magic stay ? " At first no one answered Roland 's question , and so he asked it again , this time looking across the living room of the rectory to where Henchick of the Manni sat with Cantab , who had married one of Henchick 's numerous granddaughters . The two men were holding hands , as was the Manni way . The older man had lost a granddaughter that day , but if he grieved , the emotion did not show on his stony , composed face . Next to Roland , holding no one 's hand , silent and dreadfully white , sat Eddie Dean . Beside him , cross-legged on the floor , was Jake Chambers . He had pulled Oy into his lap , a thing Roland had never seen before and would not have believed the billy-bumbler would allow . Both Eddie and Jake were splattered with blood . That on Jake 's shirt belonged to his friend Benny Slightman . That on Eddie 's belonged to Margaret Eisenhart , once Margaret of Redpath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jake looked as tired as Roland felt , but he was quite sure there would be no rest for them this night . Distant , from town , came the sounds of fireworks and singing and celebration . There was no celebration here . Benny and Margaret were dead , and Susannah was gone . " Henchick , tell me , I beg : how long will the magic stay ? " The old man stroked his beard in a distracted fashion . " Gunslinger - Roland - I ca n't say . The magic of the door in that cave is beyond me . As thee must know . " " Tell me what you think . Based on what you do know . " Eddie raised his hands . They were dirty , there was blood under the nails , and they trembled . " Tell , Henchick , " he said , speaking in a voice , humble and lost , that Roland had never heard before . " Tell , I beg . " Rosalita , Pere Callahan 's woman of all work , came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a carafe of steaming coffee . She , at least , had found time to change out of her bloody , dusty jeans and shirt and into a housedress , but her eyes were still shocked . They peered from her face like small animals from their burrows . She poured the coffee and passed the cups without speaking . Nor had she gotten all the blood , Roland saw as he took one of the cups . There was a streak of it on the back of her right hand . Margaret 's or Benny 's ? He did n't know . Or much care . The Wolves had been defeated . They might or might not come again to Calla Bryn Sturgis . That was ka 's business . Theirs was Susannah Dean , who had disappeared in the aftermath , taking Black Thirteen with her . Henchick said : " Ye ask of kaven ? " " Aye , father , " Roland agreed . " The persistence of magic . " Father Callahan took a cup of coffee with a nod and a distracted smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they 'd come back from the cave . In his lap was a book called ' Salem 's Lot , by a man of whom he had never heard . It purported to be a work of fiction , but he , Donald Callahan , was in it . He had lived in the town of which it told , had taken part in the events it recounted . He had looked on the back and on the rear flap for the author 's photograph , queerly certain that he would see a version of his own face looking back at him ( the way he 'd looked in 1975 , when these events had taken place , most likely ) , but there had been no picture , just a note about the book 's writer that told very little . He lived in the state of Maine . He was married . He 'd written one previous book , quite well reviewed , if you believed the quotations on the back . " The greater the magic , the longer it persists , " Cantab said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henchick said . " Magic and glammer , both are one , and they do unroll from the back . " He paused . " From the past , do'ee ken . " " This door opened on many places and many times in the world my friends came from , " Roland said . " I would open it again , but just on the last two . The most recent two . Can that be done ? " They waited as Henchick and Cantab considered . The Manni were great travelers . If anyone knew , if anyone could do what Roland wanted - what they all wanted - it would be these folk . Cantab leaned deferentially toward the old man , the dinh of Calla Redpath . He whispered . Henchick listened , his face expressionless , then turned Cantab 's head with one gnarled old hand and whispered back . Eddie shifted , and Roland felt him getting ready to break loose , perhaps to begin shouting . He put a restraining hand on Eddie 's shoulder , and Eddie subsided . For the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps five minutes while the others waited . The sounds of celebration in the distance were difficult for Roland to take ; God knew how they must make Eddie feel . At last Henchick patted Cantab 's cheek with his hand and turned to Roland . " We think this may be done , " he said . " Thank God , " Eddie muttered . Then , louder : " Thank God ! Let 's go up there . We can meet you on the East Road - " Both of the bearded men were shaking their heads , Henchick with a kind of stern sorrow , Cantab with a look that was almost horror . " We 'll not go up to the Cave of the Voices in the dark , " Henchick said . " We have to ! " Eddie burst out . " You do n't understand ! It 's not just a question of how long the magic will or wo n't last , it 's a question of time on the other side ! It goes faster over there , and once it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be having that baby right now , and if it 's some kind of cannibal - " " Listen to me , young fellow , " Henchick said , " and hear me very well , I beg . The day is nigh gone . " This was true . Never in Roland 's experience had a day run so quickly through his fingers . There had been the battle with the Wolves early , not long after dawn , then celebration there on the road for the victory and sorrow for their losses ( which had been amazingly small , as things had fallen ) . Then had come the realization that Susannah was gone , the trek to the cave , their discoveries there . By the time they 'd gotten back to the East Road battlefield , it had been past noon . Most of the townsfolk had left , bearing their saved children home in triumph . Henchick had agreed willingly enough to this palaver , but by the time they 'd gotten back to the rectory , the sun had been on the wrong side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rest , after all , Roland thought , and did n't know whether to be glad or disappointed . He could use sleep ; that much he did know . " I listen and hear , " Eddie said , but Roland 's hand was still on his shoulder , and he could feel the younger man trembling . " Even were we willing to go , we could n't persuade enough of the others to come wi ' us , " Henchick said . " You 're their dinh - " " Aye , so you call it , and so I suppose I am , although it is n't our word , ye ken . In most things they 'd follow me , and they know the debt they owe your ka-tet out of this day 's work and would say thank ya any way they could . But they would n't go up that path and into that haunted place after dark . " Henchick was shaking his head slowly and with great certainty . " No - that they will not do . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redpath Kra-ten well before full dark . There we 'll call our menfolk to the Tempa , which is to us as the Meeting Hall is to the forgetful folk . " He glanced briefly at Callahan . " Say pardon , Pere , if the term offends ye . " Callahan nodded absently without looking up from the book , which he was turning over and over in his hands . It had been covered in protective plastic , as valuable first editions often are . The price lightly penciled on the flyleaf was $950 . Some young man 's second novel . He wondered what made it so valuable . If they ran into the book 's owner , a man named Calvin Tower , he would surely ask . And that would only be the start of his questioning . " We 'll explain what it is ye want , and ask for volunteers . Of the sixty-eight men of Redpath Kra-ten , I believe all but four or five will agree to help - to blend their forces together . It will make powerful khef . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , " Roland said . " The sharing of water , we say . " " You could n't fit anywhere that number of men in the mouth of that cave , " Jake said . " Not even if half of them sat on the other half 's shoulders . " " No need , " Henchick said . " We 'll put the most powerful inside - what we call the senders . The others can line up along the path , linked hand to hand and bob to bob . They 'll be there before the sun goes rooftop tomorrow . I set my watch and warrant on it . " " We 'll need tonight to gather our mags and bobs , anyway , " Cantab said . He was looking at Eddie apologetically , and with some fear . The young man was in terrible pain , that was clear . And he was a gunslinger . A gunslinger might strike out , and when one did , it was never blindly . " It could be too late , " Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazel eyes . They were now bloodshot and dark with exhaustion . " Tomorrow could be too late even if the magic has n't gone away . " Roland opened his mouth and Eddie raised a finger . " Do n't say ka , Roland . If you say ka one more time , I swear my head 'll explode . " Roland closed his mouth . Eddie turned back to the two bearded men in their dark , Quakerish cloaks . " And you ca n't be sure the magic will stay , can you ? What could be opened tonight could be closed against us forever tomorrow . Not all the magnets and plumb-bobs in Manni creation could open it . " " Aye , " Henchick said . " But your woman took the magic ball with her , and whatever'ee may think , Mid-World and the Borderlands are well shed of it . " " I 'd sell my soul to have it back , and in my hands , " Eddie said clearly . They all looked shocked at this , even Jake , and Roland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back , must unsay it . There were powerful forces working against their quest for the Tower , dark ones , and Black Thirteen was their clearest sigul . What could be used could also be misused , and the bends o ' the rainbow had their own malevolent glammer , Thirteen most of all . Was the sum of all , perhaps . Even if they had possessed it , Roland would have fought to keep it out of Eddie Dean 's hands . In his current state of sorrowing distraction , the ball would either destroy him or make him its slave in minutes . " A stone might drink if it had a mouth , " Rosa said dryly , startling them all . " Eddie , questions of magic aside , think of the path that goes up there . Then think of five dozen men , many of them nigh as old as Henchick , one or two blind as bats , trying to climb it after dark . " " The boulder , " Jake said . " Remember the boulder you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the drop ? " Eddie nodded reluctantly . Roland could see him trying to accept what he could n't change . Groping for sanity . " Susannah Dean is also a gunslinger , " Roland said . " Mayhap she can take care of herself a little while . " " I do n't think Susannah 's in charge anymore , " Eddie replied , " and neither do you . It 's Mia 's baby , after all , and it 'll be Mia at the controls until the baby - the chap - comes . " Roland had an intuition then , and like so many he 'd had over the years , it turned out to be true . " She may have been in charge when they left , but she may not be able to stay in charge . " Callahan spoke at last , looking up from the book which had so stunned him . " Why not ? " " Because it 's not her world , " Roland said . " It 's Susannah 's . If they ca n't find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chapter Two Henchick and Cantab went back to Manni Redpath , first to tell the gathered ( and entirely male ) elders about the day 's work , and then to tell them what payment was required . Roland went with Rosa to her cottage . It stood up the hill from a formerly neat privy which was now mostly in ruins . Within this privy , standing useless sentinel , was what remained of Andy the Messenger Robot ( many other functions ) . Rosalita undressed Roland slowly and completely . When he was mother-naked , she stretched beside him on her bed and rubbed him with special oils : cat-oil for his aches , a creamier , faintly perfumed blend for his most sensitive parts . They made love . They came together ( the sort of physical accident fools take for fate ) , listening to the crackle of firecrackers from the Calla 's high street and the boisterous shouts of the folken , most of them now well past tipsy , from the sound . " Sleep , " she said . " Tomorrow I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overholser , not anyone in the Calla . " " Do you have the sight , then ? " Roland asked . He sounded relaxed , even amused , but even when he had been deep in her heat and thrusting , the gnaw of Susannah had never left his mind : one of his ka-tet , and lost . Even if there had been no more than that , it would have been enough to keep him from true rest or ease . " No , " said she , " but I have feelings from time to time , like any other woman , especially about when her man is getting ready to move on . " " Is that what I am to you ? Your man ? " Her gaze was both shy and steady . " For the little time ye 've been here , aye , I like to think so . Do'ee call me wrong , Roland ? " He shook his head at once . It was good to be some woman 's man again , if only for a short time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stroked his lean cheek . " We were well-met , Roland , were we not ? Well-met in the Calla . " " Aye , lady . " She touched the remains of his right hand , then his right hip . " And how are your aches ? " To her he would n't lie . " Vile . " She nodded , then took hold of his left hand , which he 'd managed to keep away from the lobstrosities . " And this un ? " " Fine , " he said , but he felt a deep ache . Lurking . Waiting its time to come out . What Rosalita called the dry twist . " Roland ! " said she . " Aye ? " Her eyes looked at him calmly . She still had hold of his left hand , touching it , culling out its secrets . " Finish your business as soon as you can . " " Is that your advice ? " " Aye , dearheart . Before your business finishes you . " Chapter Three Eddie sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what these folk would ever after call The Day of the East Road Battle passed into history ( after which it would pass into myth ... always assuming the world held together long enough for it to happen ) . In town the sounds of celebration had grown increasingly loud and feverish , until Eddie seriously began to wonder if they might not set the entire high street afire . And would he mind ? Not a whit , say thanks and you 're welcome , too . Continues ...
