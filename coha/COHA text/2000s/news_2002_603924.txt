<p> TV promos designed to entice NASCAR fans into buying race tickets show plenty of crashes and edge-of-your-seat , fender-banging finishes . But if the recently completed season is any indication , accidents and close finishes are on the decline . <p> A USA TODAY computer analysis shows there were 14% fewer accidents and spinouts this year in the Winston Cup Series than in 2001 and accidents declined at 14 of the 23 tracks . <p> None of the safety devices NASCAR has introduced since Dale Earnhardt 's high-profile death in February 2001 can account for the decline in accidents . Head-and-neck restraint collars , improved drivers ' seats and impact-absorbing wall barriers at tracks are intended to help drivers survive crashes , not prevent crashes . And they worked : There were n't any on-track deaths in NASCAR 's top three divisions for the first time since 1999 . <p> But other changes in recent years have made NASCAR 's current brand of racing more strategic and slightly less aggressive than it was when Earnhardt was in his tail-kickin ' prime and may have contributed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 173 this year : <p> * Improvements to tires ' construction and composition have made tires more durable and less susceptible to blowouts . During his speech at NASCAR 's year-end awards banquet last Friday , veteran driver Mark Martin thanked Goodyear for making what he called " the safest tire I 've ever raced on . " <p> * NASCAR has cracked down on rough driving , doling out one of the biggest penalties in series history this season to driver Kevin Harvick , putting Todd Bodine on probation for a string of on-track incidents and constantly reminding drivers to respect each other on the track . <p> * Car design improvements have caused a fundamental change in racing during the last five years . Today 's cars are sleeker than ever and handle better than ever  --  until they get in traffic jams on the track and have to slow down . <p> Drivers say traffic has never affected cars as much as it does today . When air rushes over slick hoods and fenders , it pushes the car downward and sticks it to the track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent air does n't push the trailing car down as forcefully . Suddenly , the trailing car wo n't turn when the driver turns the steering wheel ; this phenomenon is called " aero push . " <p> To avoid driving straight into the wall , a driver has to back off the gas slightly and slow down to make the car turn  --  allowing the car in front to get away . <p> Once a driver gets into the lead , he does n't have to deal with turbulence . His car handles well , making it nearly impossible for it to be passed unless the driver makes a mistake . <p> Last-lap passes decline <p> As a result , USA TODAY found , there was n't a last-lap pass for the lead this year , and 28 of 36 races did n't have any lead changes in the final 10 laps . <p> Four-time series champion Jeff Gordon frequently has voiced his displeasure about aero push but had n't realized it might be reducing accidents until asked about this season 's decline . <p> " The harder it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gordon says . " Because you ca n't pass a guy , you knock him out of the way . But then I got to thinking , the reason we ca n't pass ( now ) is because of aero push , and with aero push we ca n't get up ( close ) to them to push them out of the way . " <p> * Drivers have changed their strategies . NASCAR 's points system , devised in 1975 to crown the series champion , always has rewarded consistently good finishers over drivers who win one week and crash the next . A race 's winner earns only a few more points than the second-place driver , giving little incentive  --  other than glory , prize money and exposure for the team 's sponsor  --  to make an aggressive pass for the lead . <p> Now that it 's harder to pass , there 's even less incentive for drivers to make aggressive moves . <p> " They 've figured out that it 's a lot better to run second than to take a chance at passing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a Fox TV analyst . " What they 're doing is cutting their losses . They 're not looking at their gains . You 're sitting in a good spot  --  just stay where you are . " <p> Comparing drivers <p> The USA TODAY analysis of racing data revealed other trends : <p> * Steve Park , who returned to racing in March after taking six months to recover from a serious head injury , was involved in more wrecks and spinouts than any other driver in 2002 . Park averaged nearly five accidents or spinouts for every 10 races he ran in 2002 after averaging slightly more than one for every 10 races last year . <p> Although Park says he is fully recovered , his frequent involvement in incidents had observers wondering whether he came back too early  --  and whether NASCAR does enough to ensure injured drivers are fit to compete . <p> * Drivers ' ability to avoid accidents and spinouts apparently did not play a major role in three teams ' decisions to hire , fire or retain drivers for 2003 . Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Yates Racing dumped Ricky Rudd , whose incident rate was 16th-best , in favor of Elliott Sadler ( 33rd ) , and the MBV team dumped Kenny Schrader ( sixth ) for Jerry Nadeau ( 41st ) . <p> The reason ? Youth . The guys getting the nod for 2003 are all 35 or younger . They are replacing drivers who are 45 or older . <p> * Top-level veteran drivers by far were the least likely to crash . <p> The lowest incident rates belonged to drivers in their 30s and 40s : Sterling Marlin , Jeff Gordon , Mark Martin , Dale Jarrett and Bill Elliott . Series champion Tony Stewart , 31 , had the 10th-lowest incident rate . <p> Twentysomething stars such as Kurt Busch , Jimmie Johnson and Ryan Newman had better-than-average incident rates , while Dale Earnhardt Jr . finished slightly below average . <p> * Two tracks where drivers complained about unsafe racing conditions this season , Richmond ( Va . ) International Raceway and New Hampshire International Speedway , had fewer accidents in 2002 than they did in 2001 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fell 39% . Although new pavement at both tracks wore down and became slippery during races this season , an improved tire might have helped prevent accidents . <p> Because this comparison covers only two seasons and involves statistics NASCAR does not track , it is unclear whether the findings regarding accidents and passing are a one-year anomaly or indicate a real trend toward races that are safer , if somewhat less exciting . <p> NASCAR President Mike Helton says that of the many factors that could account for the reduction in accidents , an increased awareness of safety likely is important . <p> " After Dale 's accident and the accidents of 2000 , I think there 's an overall concerted effort among everybody , NASCAR included , " Helton says . <p> While there were a handful of relatively serious injuries in Winston Cup this year , Earnhardt Jr . and Johnny Benson recovered to win races later in the season and Marlin will return for the February opening-day race , the Daytona 500 . <p> The best way to avoid injury , of course , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor played the biggest role in reducing accidents , but several drivers cite improved tires . <p> Better tires <p> Two years ago Goodyear introduced a harder , safer tire that does n't grip the track as well but also does n't wear down as quickly ; cars do n't suddenly start sliding around after 20 or 30 laps . <p> This season Goodyear also made subtle modifications to tires used at six tracks ; all six saw a reduction in accidents . <p> An improved right-side tire used at Richmond , Phoenix and New Hampshire this year was a particularly significant advancement ; the database reveals that accidents at those tracks dropped a combined 30% . <p> One of that tire 's characteristics : It does not handle well with low air pressure . Previously , drivers and teams have been tempted to run with tires at lower air pressure because it made their cars go faster . But a tire with low air pressure also is more likely to blow out and cause spins or accidents . <p> Goodyear racing manager Phil Holmer says it is the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's sort of like an unending story : Tracks change , cars change , we change . " <p> Pit performance key <p> The harder tires have made pit strategy more important . With more durable tires , teams can reduce the time spent in the pit by only changing two tires at a time rather than four . <p> And because aero push has made it harder to pass , the driver who comes off the pit road first after the final stop of a race usually holds on to win . <p> That certainly helped driver Matt Kenseth , whose pit crew consistently turns in fast stops . Kenseth won five races this year , more than any other driver . <p> But do fans really want to see races decided in the pits , not on the track ? <p> " Too many races are decided on pit stops , " Waltrip says . " Aero push , track position , things of that nature were not a part of my vocabulary when I was racing . " <p> In Waltrip 's day , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Now passing is more difficult , but it 's not impossible . A smart driver lays back and waits for the driver in front of him to make a slight mistake , then he slips past . <p> As a result , racing is more strategic and drivers need patience . Waltrip says that translates into fewer accidents . <p> " When you have so many variables like we would have in this case  --  tires , drivers , cars , tracks  --  you have to look at everything , " Waltrip says . " It 's a little bit of everything . I do n't think we can attribute the wrecks we 've had in the past to any one thing except driver error , in most cases . " <p> NASCAR 's crackdown on rough driving will continue in 2003 , as officials scrutinize " blocking "  --  drivers who zigzag across the track to keep other cars behind them . Waltrip says the threat of penalties is the only way to make drivers behave . <p> " It 's just like any other game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you can go back there and knock the quarterback down and put him out of the game and there 's no rule against it , then somebody 's going to do it . " <p> NASCAR officials say safer racing does n't have to be less exciting . <p> Livelier competition ? <p> In addition to new safety initiatives , Winston Cup Series director John Darby is working on a long-term project to enliven competition by making the cars less dependent on aerodynamics . <p> Despite the lack of late-race passes , there were plenty of juicy story lines in 2002 : Young drivers took over , Stewart punched a photographer and Gordon snapped a career-worst winning streak amid a high-profile divorce . <p> And while Helton was somewhat surprised to hear that there were n't any last-lap passes for the lead this year , he says he does n't think the racing was less entertaining than in previous years . <p> " We had 18 different winners this year , 19 different winners last year and a lot of races decided at the line by less than a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general was very exciting .
