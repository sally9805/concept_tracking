As this protracted recession plays out and millions are laid off , there may be some reassurance in knowing that many of the job-creating company founders and CEOs of the future will rise from the ashes of today 's unemployed . <p> That 's the way it 's played out in the past . In 1989 , Bob Bales was working as project manager for technology company CACI International on a Navy contract that was suddenly canceled . Bales and 180 others were shown the door . He launched a tech company , NCSA , into the teeth of the 1990-91 recession , then launched two more in 2000 and 2006 . " All told , the companies have provided more than 1,000 new jobs , " Bales says . <p> The U.S. economy lost 3.6 million jobs in the last 13 months , and millions more will go before the economy turns around . The good news is that talented people will grow frustrated with the job search and take the dive into entrepreneurship . The number who succeed will be small . <p> But among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he was pushed out by supermarket chain Finast-Edwards when his division was sold in 1985 ; or a New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , fired from Salomon Bros. , only to start the financial news service that made him a billionaire and today employs about 10,000 . <p> Crushing setbacks are a critical element of success , says Yale University management expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld , co-author of Firing Back : How Great Leaders Rebound After Career Disasters . Those setbacks often come early , and Sonnenfeld says that among MBA students at Yale , Harvard and Emory universities , 25% have already been laid off or fired . Campbell Soup CEO Douglas Conant , who has a 1976 MBA from Northwestern University 's Kellogg School of Management , worked his way to head of marketing for Parker Bros. when parent company General Mills decided to exit the toy and game business in the 1980s . He was out of work for about a year and emphasizes that it was a turning point in his life . <p> At USA TODAY 's request , the CEO organization Vistage International surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they had been laid off or fired before becoming a founder or CEO . Among those who involuntarily lost a job , 78% said that , in retrospect , it turned out to be good for their careers . Only 2% say that it turned out badly . USA TODAY also asked SmartBrief , a company that e-mails news articles of interest to top executives , to survey CEOs and company owners . It found that 61% of 626 respondents said they had been laid off or fired , and half of those said it was the best thing that ever happened . <p> A few success stories can make a big difference . David Thomson , a former McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant and author of Blueprint to a Billion , says 7,500 U.S. companies went public from 1985 to 2007 , but the 5% ( 387 ) that reached $1 billion in revenue created 56% of the jobs . <p> Peter Pifer , 70 , says 2009 reminds him of 1992 , when he was putting his two children through college and thinking about making his stretch run toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scientific-Atlanta in the 1980s to start an electronics assembly company in Norcross , Ga . Ten years later , it was doing well enough to go public . Then , a competitor moved in from Alabama and " ate up all the business " just as the U.S. economy was recovering from a recession aggravated by the first Gulf War and a jump in oil prices . <p> The bank pulled his line of credit , and he was " shut down overnight ... laid off by the bank , " Pifer says . The company , backed by Pifer 's personal assets , went bankrupt . He lost two homes . At 54 , he told his kids they would have to work their way through college and his wife that they were broke , living on unemployment , and moving into an apartment . Six months later , he was diagnosed with prostate cancer . <p> " It 's easy to get despondent , " but Pifer says to keep faith . He 's now CEO of Enhanced Telecommunications , a broadband and data software company he founded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after going through bankruptcy . Enhanced Telecommunications has 30 employees and $5 million in annual revenue and owes " not a nickel to the bank , " Pifer says . <p> Propulsion engineers Mike Peery and Don Roberts were developing computer programs at Boeing when Boeing cut its research budget during the wicked downturn of the early 1980s . The two volunteered for a layoff to start a software engineering firm now named Tecplot , which has had an annual growth rate of 15% since 1985 . Tecplot employs 43 . <p> Timing can be everything <p> The best time to start a business is when everyone else believes it 's the worst time , says Julie Northcutt , who was laid off from golf-related Internet start-up Golfserv in 2001 just before the Sept. 11 attacks , then started Chicagoland Caregivers , an agency that provided services to seniors needing home care . She sold the 125-employee company in 2007 and started Caregiverlist.com , a website that matches senior homes to employees . <p> Everyone else used the economic downturn as an excuse to do nothing , which meant less competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really good time to start a business . I have always been entrepreneurial , and I just never really had the time , or made the time , to work on my business ideas until I was laid off . " <p> Martin Bodley was laid off from his job as director of new technology in 2003 when Denmark-based headset maker GN Netcom decided to cut costs and consolidate more work in Copenhagen . He co-founded wireless company Revolabs , where he is CEO . It has 42 full-time employees . <p> " There is life after layoffs , " Bodley says . " If it were n't for my layoff , Revolabs would not exist . " <p> " Sometimes we need that extra push when a great idea is upon us , but we 're too comfortable to pull the trigger , " says George Burke , co-founder of BookSwim , a company that rents books much as Netflix rents movies . <p> Burke says it was " a breath of fresh air " when he was fired in 2006 as online marketing manager from Sessions Online School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have launched BookSwim without being fired . I probably would have continued to plan and plan some more until the concept got old or until I talked myself out of its feasibility . " <p> People should not feel victimized by pink slips , Bales says . " This is the land of opportunity . In today 's environment , you can not depend on some large company , and certainly not the government , to take care of you . " <p> In 1991 , Dan Berman was hired as vice president of an outsourcing call center . Two days after starting his job , he was told that funding had fallen through , and he was asked to work for free for two weeks . That arrangement dragged on for two months . He decided that if he was going to work for free , he might as well work for himself . <p> He started PharmaCentra , a pharmaceutical marketing company in Atlanta . He made $5,000 his first year but now has 100 employees . " There will be many opportunities as the economy shifts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some signs that this recession is playing out as recessions have in the past . Matt Flocks spent 16 years with Forest City Ratner , a real estate developer that owns 11 million square feet of commercial property in New York . He was vice president when company stock plunged all employees . <p> Flocks founded Orbis Associates , a nine-employee company designed to weather the recession by becoming an outsourcer to help other real estate developers survive . When the time is right , Orbis will be positioned to become a " full-fledged development company on the economic upside , " Flocks said . <p> Flocks predicts others in many industries are using a similar strategy to " leverage the down economy and come out on the upswing . " <p> " Never give in , especially to negative emotions , " advises Scott Rosenberg , an industrial engineer by training , who founded Miro Consulting in 2000 after being laid off more than once . Miro , which provides software consulting services for 10 of the largest 100 companies , has 18 full-time employees and $25 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatively , " Rosenberg says . " Have a tolerance for risk , and try something new . Seek to understand your strengths , not limitations . " <p> Getting grounded <p> Holly Green , CEO of The Human Factor , says recessions can give competitive people time to breathe . She was twice laid off in 2002 , first from a biotech start-up , then The Ken Blanchard Cos . She says she took a low-paying job for 18 months to " build back my emotional stamina , " before launching the human resources consulting company . " In tough times , you may have to remain humble and be willing to take a few steps back , " Green says . <p> Steve Carley has been laid off three times . Today he 's CEO of El Pollo Loco , a 386-store chicken chain that employs 4,000 people , not including those working at 247 franchise restaurants . <p> " I would n't have this phenomenal opportunity without those layoffs , and would have missed out on one of the most gratifying leadership opportunities of my career , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that one-third of the CEOs have laid off employees in the last year , and one-third anticipate even fewer total employees by the end of 2009 . Other CEOs interviewed by USA TODAY said that being themselves laid off in the past caused them to look at present layoffs with a different perspective . <p> " I am sensitive about making sure that any necessary layoff is handled properly in terms of timing , message and communication with those affected and the remaining staff , " Bodley says . Still , he says , those at the top must do what 's best for the company . <p> Four years ago , Berman says he laid off Clark Ridge , who has since returned as PharmaCentra 's vice president of operations and is a superstar . The layoff proved to be good for Ridge 's career , because he gained broader experience , Berman says . <p> " It 's one of the most difficult things I have to do as a business owner , " says Jeffrey Menaged , CEO of Chief Executive Air . " When you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Still , America is a country filled with freedom and opportunity . How can there be no room for people who want to work ?
